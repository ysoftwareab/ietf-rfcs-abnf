Internet-Draft    ACTN : Use case for Multi Tenant VNO         July 2015


1.  Introduction

   This document provides a use case that addresses the need for
   facilitating virtual network operation: creation and operation of
   multi-tenant virtual networks that use the common core network
   resources.  This will accelerate a rapid service deployment of new
   services, including more dynamic and elastic services, and improve
   overall network operations and scaling of existing services.

   Generally, carrier's core network consists of multi-domain networks.
   For instance, a network may have multiple confederation ASes that
   have each own IGP network using IS-IS or OSPF.  In other instance, a
   network may consist of multiple vendor's optical transport networks
   that have each own Network Management System (NMS).  In such a
   carrier's multi-domain core network, it is difficult to create an
   end-to-end virtual network that meets customer's requirements (e.g.
   topology, AS, bandwidth, delay and jitter).

   This use case supports Abstraction and Control of Transport Networks
   (ACTN).  The aim of ACTN is to facilitate virtual network operation,
   creation of a virtualized environment allowing operators to view and
   control multi-subnet multi-technology networks into a single
   virtualized network.  Related documents are:
   [I-D.leeking-teas-actn-problem-statement] and
   [I-D.ceccarelli-teas-actn-framework] which provide detailed
   information regarding this work.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Motivation

   One of the main motivations for multi-tenant virtual networks that
   share the common core transport network resource is to increase the
   network utilization of the core transport network.  As each service
   network has evolved in a different time with different service needs,
   many dedicated overlay networks have formed to support different
   service needs.  This results in an inefficient use of network
   resources and the complexity in operating such diverse service
   networks.  Due to the lack of the coordination across different
   service networks and the common service platform, the introduction of
   new services is not as speedy as the operators' desire.  Part of the
   reasons for this difficulty is due to the lack of the virtual network
   infrastructure.  Figure 1 shows an illustration of the current
   multiple service network architecture.

             Figure 1: Multiple Services Network Architecture

   The characteristics of the multiple services network are as follows:

   o  Each service has its own dedicated access points (e.g., PE
      routers) in the core network.

   o  Each service or a group of services may be operated in a different
      service operations department within an operator.  For instance,
      the VPN service and the mobile service may be operated by two
      different departments while whole sale Internet service by another
      department.

   o  There may be dedicated core transport network resources for some
      services to ensure a strict service guarantee.

   o  There may be little or no coordination for operating multiple
      services in terms of network resource allocation or sharing of the
      resources.

4.  Multi-tenant Virtual Network Consolidation

   This section discusses key aspects to support multi-tenant virtual
   network consolidation.

4.1.  Service Consolidation

   Multi-tenant virtual network operation should support different
   services as the tenants that share the common core transport network




Kumaki & Miyasaka        Expires January 7, 2016                [Page 4]

   resources.  Therefore, it is important to understand the type of
   various services and its service requirement.

4.2.  VPN Service Consolidation

   Network providers have many different service networks such as VPNs
   of various types and different QoS requirements.  Within VPNs, there
   are several QoS levels.  Some VPN is best-effort VPN while other VPNs
   require a strict QoS such as bandwidth guarantee and latency.
   Therefore, multi-level VPNs should be supported in multi-tenant
   virtual network consolidation.

4.3.  Network Wholesale Service

   Network providers want to provide a network resource (i.e. a network
   slice) to ISPs.  Generally, ISPs have each own ASes and they do not
   want to change their own network policy.  We can deploy these network
   wholesale services by using "carrier's carrier" in [RFC4364].
   However, ISPs need to change their network policy and run LDP at an
   edge router at ISP's edge routers although just IP is running on
   their original network.  Additionally, they (i.e. network architects
   at ISPs) need to transfer MPLS knowledge to their network operators.

   In another aspect, the network provider must guarantee the SLA to
   each ISP.  There may be different level of SLA as well as different
   level of virtual network granularity for each ISP.  The ISP should be
   given its virtual network(s) as well as an independent domain control
   of allocated virtual network(s).  It is also to be noted that there
   may be different grade of services required depending on the nature
   of the whole sale.  For instance, CATV operator may require a
   different grade of service than best-effort internet services.
   Therefore, multi-level wholesale services should be supported in
   multi-tenant virtual network consolidation.  Also, network providers
   should not provide unnecessary network information (e.g.  TE database
   and IGP information in core transport network) to ISPs.  To provide
   unnecessary information in core transport network poses security
   issues.  Therefore, network providers should provide only necessary
   network information to create ISP's virtual network.

4.4.  On-demand Network Service

   Some ISPs may need a network resource (i.e. a network slice) during
   the specific time and period.  This is referred to as on-demand
   network service.  This implies that virtual networks should be
   created/deleted dynamically and the resources (e.g. bandwidth) of
   virtual networks should be added/decreased dynamically.

Internet-Draft    ACTN : Use case for Multi Tenant VNO         July 2015


4.5.  Redundant Network Service

   Some service requires a number of redundant network paths that are
   physically diverse from one another.  This implies that the virtual
   networks should indicate link and node diversity constraints.

4.6.  Mobile/LTE Access Service

   Consumer mobile/LTE access can be a tenant that shares the resources
   of the core transport network.  In such case, a strict latency with a
   guaranteed bandwidth should be supported by multi-tenant virtual
   network operation.

5.  Multi-tenant Virtual Network Operation Coordination

   The following Figure 2 depicts a functional control architecture that
   shows the need to support virtual networks to a number of different
   service networks that share the common core network resources.

   There are a few characteristics of the above architecture.

   1.  The core transport network is the common transport network
       resource pool for a number of multiple tenants, which is referred
       to as network tenancy.

   2.  Each service is a client to the common transport network.

   3.  Each service should be guaranteed its operational independence
       from other services.  The separation of service control (depicted
       as separate boxes) in the above figure represents an operational
       independence.

   4.  The virtual network for each service is created and assigned by
       the multi-tenant virtual network coordination function.  This is
       a functional entity that communicates with each service control
       and the core transport network control/management entities in
       order to coordinate with the necessary communication.

   5.  Each service instantiates its service instance based on its
       virtual network.

   6.  Each service is in control of its virtual network and operates on
       the virtual network.

   7.  As a number of services carried on the common transport network
       sharing a common network resource, operational independence for
       each service has to be guaranteed as if each service owns its
       dedicated virtual resources.

   8.  The level of abstraction of a virtual network is determined by
       each service and may differ from one another.  In some cases, a
       virtual network should represent a graph form of topology
       abstraction of the virtual network.

6.  High-level Requirements for Multi-tenant Virtual Network Operations

   Based on the discussion in the previous sections, this section
   provides the overall requirements that must be supported.

6.1.  Dynamic binding - On-demand Virtual Network Service Creation

   The solution needs to provide the ability to create a new virtual
   network on demand.  The virtual network should be built dynamically.

Internet-Draft    ACTN : Use case for Multi Tenant VNO         July 2015


6.2.  Domain Control Plane/Routing Layer Separation

   The solution needs to support an independent control plane for a
   domain service control.  This implies that each service domain has
   its own VN control scheme that is independent of other domain or the
   core transport network control.

6.3.  Separate Operation of Virtual Services

   The solution needs to support an independent operation of a virtual
   network and a service.  Each Service Administrators should be able to
   control and manage its virtual network in terms of policy and
   resource allocation (e.g., CPU, Memory, other resources.)  In
   addition, the virtualized networks should not affect each other in
   any way.

6.4.  QoS/SLA

   The solution needs to provide an independent QoS/SLA per a virtual
   network depending on a service level.  Each QoS on the virtual
   network should support multiple service levels.  Each SLA on the
   virtual network should fulfill a bandwidth and a latency required by
   each service.

6.5.  VN diversity

   Each service should be able to create multiple diverse VNs for the
   diversity purpose.  The diversity for VNs must be physically diverse
   in the core transport network.  This implies that the core transport
   network control/management plane must be able to factor the SRLG
   information when creating multiple VNs to ensure VN diversity.

6.6.  Security Concerns

   The solution needs to keep the confidentiality between the services.
   A service should not have the connectivity to an another service
   through the common core transport network.
