Abstract

   The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [1] provides a standard method for
   transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links.  PPP
   defines an extensible Link Control Protocol (LCP) for establishing,
   configuring, and testing the data-link connection; and a family of
   Network Control Protocols (NCPs) for establishing and configuring
   different network-layer protocols.  This document defines a general
   mechanism for proprietary vendor extensions.

1.  Control Packets

   The Packet format and basic facilities are already defined for LCP
   [1] and related NCPs.

   Up-to-date values of the LCP Code field are specified in the most
   recent "Assigned Numbers" [2].  This document concerns the following
   values:

       0      Vendor Specific



1.1.  Vendor Specific Packet

   Description

      Some implementors might not need nor want to publish their propri-
      etary algorithms and attributes.  This mechanism is available to
      specify these without encumbering the IANA with proprietary number
      requests.

      Vendor Specific packets MAY be sent at any time, including before
      LCP has reached the Opened state.

      The sender transmits a LCP or NCP packet with the Code field set
      to 0 (Vendor Specific), the Identifier field set, the local Magic-
      Number (if any) inserted, the OUI and Kind fields set, and the
      Value(s) field filled with any desired data, but not exceeding the
      default MRU minus twelve.

      Receipt of a Vendor Specific packet causes the RXR or RUC event.
      The response to the Vendor Specific packet is vender specific.

      Receipt of a Code-Reject for the packet SHOULD generate the RXJ+
      (permitted) event.

   Rationale:

      This is defined as general feature of all PPP Control Protocols,
      to avoid future conflicts in vendor secretly self-assigned Code
      numbers.

   A summary of the Vendor Specific packet format is shown below.  The
   fields are transmitted from left to right.

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Code

       0 for Vendor Specific

   Identifier

      The Identifier field MUST be changed for each Vendor Specific
      packet sent.

   Length

      >= 12

      When the Length is twelve, no Value(s) field is present.

   Magic-Number

      The Magic-Number field is four octets and aids in detecting links
      that are in the looped-back condition.  Until the Magic-Number
      Configuration Option has been successfully negotiated, the Magic-
      Number MUST be transmitted as zero.  See the Magic-Number Configu-
      ration Option for further explanation.

   OUI

      three octets.  The vendor's Organizationally Unique Identifier,
      assigned by IEEE 802 (see [RFC-1700] for contact details).  The
      bits within the octet are in canonical order, and the most signif-
      icant octet is transmitted first.

   Kind

      one octet.  Indicates a sub-type for the OUI.  There is no stan-
      dardization for this field.  Each OUI implements its own values.

   Value(s)

      Zero or more octets.  The details are implementation specific.


2.  Configuration Options

   The Configuration Option format and basic options are already defined
   for LCP [1].

   Up-to-date values of the LCP Option Type field are specified in the
   most recent "Assigned Numbers" [2].  This document concerns the fol-
   lowing values:

       0      Vendor-Specific



2.1.  Vendor-Specific Option

   Description

      Some implementors might not need nor want to publish their propri-
      etary algorithms and attributes.  This mechanism is available to
      specify these without encumbering the IANA with proprietary number
      requests.

      Before accepting this option, the implementation must verify that
      the Organizationally Unique Identifier and Kind specify a known
      mechanism, and that any vendor specific negotiation values are
      fully understood.

   Rationale:

      This is defined as general feature of all PPP Control Protocols,
      to avoid future conflicts in vendor secretly self-assigned Type
      numbers.

   A summary of the Vendor-Specific Configuration Option format is shown
   below.  The fields are transmitted from left to right.

   Type

       0

   Length

      >= 6

      When the Length is six, no Value(s) field is present.

   OUI

      three octets.  The vendor's Organizationally Unique Identifier,
      assigned by IEEE 802 (see [RFC-1700] for contact details).  The
      bits within the octet are in canonical order, and the most signif-
      icant octet is transmitted first.

   Kind

      one octet.  Indicates a sub-type for the OUI.  There is no stan-
      dardization for this field.  Each OUI implements its own values.

   Value(s)

      Zero or more octets.  The details are implementation specific.
