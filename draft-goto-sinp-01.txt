Abstract

   This document describes SINP (Session  Identity Notification Protocol)
   specification.  SINP provides information of Sessions of reserved flow
   in the transport layer and their corresponding VCs (Virtual Circuits) 
   in datalink layer.

1.Introduction

   SINP is a protocol to correspond between QoSed flow  of the transport
   layer  and  VC of ATM.  A communication in the internet  using ATM is
   guaranteed of  QoS  on the  datalink  layer with  establishing  a  VC
   satisfied  QoS's  request between  hosts.  But,  if  a  sender  host,
   receiver  host  and  intermediate  router(s)  do  not  understand  to
   established  a  VC  for  which  flow,  then  this flow's  QoS is  not
   guaranteed on upper layer. Thus SINP is used to notify information of
   the QoSed flow corresponding to the VC.

   On  CSRs (Cell Switch  Routers) [CONV-IP],  SINP  is used to  connect
   appropriate VCs  between adjacent  datalink layer  segments.  SINP is
   also necessary with NHRP [NHRP], because  a host which is established
   a VC by ATM setup signal need to understand for guarantee of QoS that
   the VC is established for which flow.

   SINP specification itself is simple because most  of the VC setup and
   error handling job is assumed to be performed in the datalink layer.

INTERNET DRAFT             SINP Specification               January 1996

   SINP is specified  as a separate  protocol than a field in  transport
   layer reservation protocols [RSVP, ST2], because:

      1) The  correspondence between a VC and a flow should be given in-
         dependent of the reservation protocols.

      2) The natural  signaling  direction of the  datalink layer may be
         different from that of the natural propagation direction of the
         transport layer reservation request.

   SINP message is carried in UDP with the port number of <to be assigned
   by IANA>.

2. Terminology

   Session
      A  Session is a transport layer  flow which reserves resources.  A
      Session  is  established  between  end  points  but  resource  are
      reserved in datalink layer segments or on  routers  on the way.  A
      Session  is identified  by a Session ID in the transport layer and
      by VCID within each datalink layer segment.

   Session ID
      A Session ID is an identifier of  a Session. Session ID depends on
      resource reservation protocol.

   ATM
      ATM is datalink technology which guarantees the QoS of each VC. In
      ATM, signaling mechanism is provided to dynamically establish VCs.

   CSR (Cell Switch Router)
      CSR is a router which can relay cell  by cell between ATM datalink
      layer segments  [CONV-IP].  On  the catenet  model using CSR, a VC
      which is established  for a flow  through  subnet is terminated in
      each intermediate CSR.

   Calling host
      This  host   (include  router)   sends  ATM  setup  signaling  for
      establishing VC. 

   Called host  
      This  host (include  router)  receives  ATM  setup  signaling  for
      establishing VC.
      On the catenet model using  CSR,  since a VC is terminated in each
      intermediate CSR, therefore intermediate CSR is called host at the
      time of receiving ATM setup signal, and CSR is calling host at the
      time  of  sending  ATM  setup signal  to  establish  a VC  in that
      receiver direction.

   VCID (Virtual Channel IDentifier)
      VCID  is a  32  bit  integer  of a  VC's datalink layer identifier
      shared between adjacent pair of a calling host and a called host. 
      A unique VCID  is assigned by  a calling  host. It can simply be a
      sequence number.

INTERNET DRAFT             SINP Specification               January 1996


   BHLI (Broadband High Layer Information)

      BHLI is  a field of ATM setup signal,  which designates purpose of
      the VC in the  upper layer. If the BHLI field  can be made lengthy
      enough,  Session identity can  be directly described  in  the BHLI
      field and SINP is  not necessary. But, BHLI length is limited to 8
      bytes  [ATM-SPEC3.1]  which is, as shown in  section 4.3,  shorter
      than typical Session ID.  With SINP, BHLI carries VCID.

3. SINP Protocol Specification

   A calling host  usually sends  ATM  setup  signal for establishing VC
   from a calling host to a called  host, then the  called host can know
   that the VC is established for  which flow with sending a Session ID
   put in BHLI field.  But, since BHLI  field has only 8bytes, therefore
   it  is difficult to put a Session ID in  BHLI field. At that  time we
   use SINP to  support BHLI field  function. SINP send a  message which
   include a Session ID corresponding to VCID put in BHLI field.

3.2 SINP Messages Structure

   SINP has two message types: NOTIFY and INQUIRY.

   [INQUIRY]
      An INQUIRY  message is issued to query Session ID when a host or a
      router receives signaling with unknown VCID.

      An INQUIRY message has the following field.

         o. VCID

   [NOTIFY]
      A NOTIFY message is used  to notify correspondence between Session
      ID and  VCID.  A  NOTIFY message is first  sent with  a  signaling
      initiation.  If the NOTIFY message is lost in network, a host or a
      router  which received the  signaling  responds  with  an  INQUIRY
      message to request the NOTIFY message again.

      A NOTIFY message has the following fields.

         o. VCID

         o. Session ID

3.2 Datalink Layer Signaling and SINP Functional Specification

   When a calling host initiates signaling to establish a VC to a called
   host,  SINP messages  are  exchanged  as follows to map the transport
   layer Session ID and a datalink layer VCID.

   (1)   At first,  calling host  initiates signaling to  establish a VC
         and  sends  a NOTIFY message  to called host. The  calling host
         should  keep  the  information  of  the NOTIFY  message for  30

INTERNET DRAFT             SINP Specification               January 1996


         seconds after signaling.

   (2)   If the calling host  receives an INQUIRY message for  a certain
         VCID from  the  called host,  the calling  host  sends a NOTIFY
         message for the VCID to the called host.

   (3.1) If the called host receives  a NOTIFY message before signaling,
         called host should keep the information  in  the NOTIFY message
         for 30 seconds.

   (3.2) If a VC is established between a calling host and a called host
         but the called  host has not yet  received  a NOTIFY message on
         the VC, then the  called host should send an INQUIRY  message. 
         The INQUIRY messages  are sent 5  times  with  intervals  of  5
         seconds till  the  NOTIFY message  is received.   If  a  NOTIFY
         message can be received  within 30  seconds after  establishing
         the VC, then a called host should be torn down the VC.

   (4)   If the  VC is disconnected before  receiving a  NOTIFY message,
         called host terminates sending a INQUIRY message.

   When  a called host  receives a  NOTIFY message, the calling host and
   the called  host can establish  correspondence between the Session in
   the transport layer  and  the VC in  the datalink layer. A VCID value
   for a  VC  should not be reused again for another  VC  as soon as the
   original VC is torn down.

3.3 SINP and Multicast

   For multicasting, SINP messages may be exchanged separately between a
   sender and  individual  receivers.  With CATENET model, this will not
   cause scalability problem, because subnets are small.

   RP-type

   C-type
      Identifies object type. Values are defined in RSVP specification.

      3 = IPv6(using Flow Label)

   Style-ID
      Identifies the filter style.  Values are defined in RSVP
      specification.
      1 = WF (Wildcard-Filter Style)
      2 = FF (Fixed-Filter Style)
      3 = SE (Shared Explicit Style)

   Protocol ID
      The IP protocol Identifier, or zero to indicate a 'wildcard'.

   DestAddress
      The IP unicast or multicast destination address of the session.

   SrcAddress
      The IP source address for sender host, or zero to
      indicate a 'wildcard'.

   DestPort
      The UDP/TCP destination port for the Session. Zero may be used
      to indicate a 'wildcard', i.e., any port.

   SrcPort
      The UDP/TCP source port for sender, or zero to indicate a
      'wildcard', i.e., any port.

   When  Sessions are  reserved in  transport  layer using  Fixed Filter
   Style  or  Shared Explicit  Style,  SrcAddress and  SrcPort  are  not
   necessary.  But  NOTIFY message has these  informations, because when
   using  Fixed  Filter  Style  or   Shared  Explicit  Style,   VCs  are
   established each source hosts in datalink layer.
