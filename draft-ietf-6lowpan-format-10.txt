Internet-Draft           IPv6 over IEEE 802.15.4           February 2007


1.  Introduction

   The IEEE 802.15.4 standard [ieee802.15.4] targets low power personal
   area networks.  This document defines the frame format for
   transmission of IPv6 [RFC2460] packets as well as the formation of
   IPv6 link-local addresses and statelessly autoconfigured addresses on
   top of IEEE 802.15.4 networks.  Since IPv6 requires support of packet
   sizes much larger than the largest IEEE 802.15.4 frame size, an
   adaptation layer is defined.  This document also defines mechanisms
   for header compression required to make IPv6 practical on IEEE
   802.15.4 networks, and the provisions required for packet delivery in
   IEEE 802.15.4 meshes.  However, a full specification of mesh routing
   (the specific protocol used, the interactions with neighbor
   discovery, etc) is out of scope of this document.

1.1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.2.  Terms used

   AES:  Advanced Encryption Scheme
   CSMA/CA:  Carrier Sense Multiple Access / Collision Avoidance
   FFD:  Full Function Device
   GTS:  Guaranteed Time Service
   MTU:  Maximum Transmission Unit
   MAC:  Media Access Control
   PAN:  Personal Area Network
   RFD:  Reduced Function Device



2.  IEEE 802.15.4 mode for IP

   IEEE 802.15.4 defines four types of frames: beacon frames, MAC
   command frames, acknowledgement frames and data frames.  IPv6 packets
   MUST be carried on data frames.  Data frames may optionally request
   that they be acknowledged.  In keeping with [RFC3819] it is
   recommended that IPv6 packets be carried in frames for which
   acknowledgements are requested so as to aid link-layer recovery.
   IEEE 802.15.4 networks can either be nonbeacon-enabled or beacon-
   enabled [ieee802.15.4].  The latter is an optional mode in which
   devices are synchronized by a so-called coordinator's beacons.  This
   allows the use of superframes within which a contention-free
   Guaranteed Time Service (GTS) is possible.  This document does not
   require that IEEE networks run in beacon-enabled mode.  In nonbeacon-



Montenegro, et al.       Expires August 6, 2007                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft           IPv6 over IEEE 802.15.4           February 2007


   enabled networks, data frames (including those carrying IPv6 packets)
   are sent via the contention-based channel access method of unslotted
   CSMA/CA.

   In nonbeacon-enabled networks, beacons are not used for
   synchronization.  However, they are still useful for link-layer
   device discovery to aid in association and disassociation events.
   This document recommends that beacons be configured so as to aid
   these functions.  A further recommendation is for these events to be
   available at the IPv6 layer to aid in detecting network attachment, a
   problem being worked on at the IETF at the time of this writing.

   The specification allows for frames in which either the source or
   destination addresses (or both) are elided.  The mechanisms defined
   in this document require that both source and destination addresses
   be included in the IEEE 802.15.4 frame header.  The source or
   destination PAN ID fields may also be included.


3.  Addressing Modes

   IEEE 802.15.4 defines several addressing modes: it allows the use of
   either IEEE 64-bit extended addresses or (after an association event)
   16-bit addresses unique within the PAN [ieee802.15.4].  This document
   supports both 64-bit extended addresses, and 16-bit short addresses.
   For use within 6LoWPANs, this document imposes additional constraints
   (beyond those imposed by IEEE 802.15.4) on the format of the 16-bit
   short addresses, as specified in Section 12.  Short addresses being
   transient in nature, a word of caution is in order: since they are
   doled out by the PAN coordinator function during an association
   event, their validity and uniqueness is limited by the lifetime of
   that association.  This can be cut short by expiration of the
   association or simply by any mishap occurring to the PAN coordinator.
   Because of the scalability issues posed by such a centralized
   allocation and single point of failure at the PAN coordinator,
   deployers should carefully weigh the tradeoffs (and implement the
   necessary mechanisms) of growing such networks based on short
   addresses.  Of course, IEEE 64-bit extended addresses may not suffer
   from these drawbacks, but still share the remaining scalability
   issues concerning routing, discovery, configuration, etc.

   This document assumes that a PAN maps to a specific IPv6 link, hence
   it implies a unique prefix.  Knowledge of the 16-bit PAN ID (e.g., by
   including it in the IEEE 802.15.4 headers) would enable automatically
   mapping it to the corresponding IPv6 prefix.  One possible method is
   to concatenate the 16 bits of PAN ID to a /48 in order to obtain the
   64-bit link prefix.  Whichever method is used, the assumption in this
   document is that a given PAN ID maps to a unique IPv6 prefix.  This

Internet-Draft           IPv6 over IEEE 802.15.4           February 2007


   complies with the recommendation that shared networks support link-
   layer subnet [RFC3819] broadcast.  Strictly speaking, it is multicast
   not broadcast that exists in IPv6.  However, multicast is not
   supported natively in IEEE 802.15.4.  Hence, IPv6 level multicast
   packets MUST be carried as link-layer broadcast frames in IEEE
   802.15.4 networks.  This MUST be done such that the broadcast frames
   are only heeded by devices within the specific PAN of the link in
   question.  As per section 7.5.6.2 in [ieee802.15.4], this is
   accomplished as follows:

   1.  A destination PAN identifier is included in the frame, and it
       MUST match the PAN ID of the link in question.

   2.  A short destination address is included in the frame, and it MUST
       match the broadcast address (0xffff).

   Additionally, support for mapping of IPv6 multicast addresses MAY be
   provided as per Section 9.  A full specification of such
   functionality is out of scope of this document.

   As usual, hosts learn IPv6 prefixes via router advertisements as per
   [I-D.ietf-ipv6-2461bis].  The working group may pursue additional
   mechanisms as well.


4.  Maximum Transmission Unit

   The MTU size for IPv6 packets over IEEE 802.15.4 is 1280 octets.
   However, a full IPv6 packet does not fit in an IEEE 802.15.4 frame.
   802.15.4 protocol data units have different sizes depending on how
   much overhead is present [ieee802.15.4].  Starting from a maximum
   physical layer packet size of 127 octets (aMaxPHYPacketSize) and a
   maximum frame overhead of 25 (aMaxFrameOverhead), the resultant
   maximum frame size at the media access control layer is 102 octets.
   Link-layer security imposes further overhead, which in the maximum
   case (21 octets of overhead in the AES-CCM-128 case, versus 9 and 13
   for AES-CCM-32 and AES-CCM-64, respectively) leaves only 81 octets
   available.  This is obviously far below the minimum IPv6 packet size
   of 1280 octets, and in keeping with section 5 of the IPv6
   specification [RFC2460], a fragmention and reassembly adaptation
   layer must be provided at the layer below IP.  Such a layer is
   defined below in Section 5.

   Furthermore, since the IPv6 header is 40 octets long, this leaves
   only 41 octets for upper-layer protocols, like UDP.  The latter uses
   8 octets in the header which leaves only 33 octets for application
   data.  Additionally, as pointed out above, there is a need for a
   fragmentation and reassembly layer, which will use even more octets.

Internet-Draft           IPv6 over IEEE 802.15.4           February 2007


   The above considerations lead to the following two observations:

   1.  The adaptation layer must be provided to comply with IPv6
       requirements of minimum MTU.  However, it is expected that (a)
       most applications of IEEE 802.15.4 will not use such large
       packets, and (b) small application payloads in conjunction with
       proper header compression will produce packets that fit within a
       single IEEE 802.15.4 frame.  The justification for this
       adaptation layer is not just for IPv6 compliance, as it is quite
       likely that the packet sizes produced by certain application
       exchanges (e.g., configuration or provisioning) may require a
       small number of fragments.

   2.  Even though the above space calculation shows the worst case
       scenario, it does point out the fact that header compression is
       compelling to the point of almost being unavoidable.  Since we
       expect that most (if not all) applications of IP over IEEE
       802.15.4 will make use of header compression, it is defined below
       in Section 10.


5.  LoWPAN Adaptation Layer and Frame Format

   The encapsulation formats defined in this section, (subsequently
   referred to as the "LoWPAN encapsulation") are the payload in the
   IEEE 802.15.4 MAC protocol data unit (PDU).  The LoWPAN payload
   (e.g., an IPv6 packet) follows this encapsulation header.

   All LoWPAN encapsulated datagrams transported over IEEE 802.15.4 are
   prefixed by an encapsulation header stack.  Each header in the header
   stack contains a header type followed zero or more header fields.
   Whereas in an IPv6 header the stack would contain, in order,
   addressing, hop-by-hop options, routing, fragmentation, destination
   options, and finally payload [RFC2460]; in a LoWPAN header the
   analogous header sequence is mesh (L2) addressing, hop-by-hop options
   (including L2 broadcast/multicast), fragmentation, and finally
   payload.  These examples show typical header stacks that may be used
   in a LoWPAN network.

   A LoWPAN encapsulated IPv6 datagram:

      +---------------+-------------+---------+
      | IPv6 Dispatch | IPv6 Header | Payload |
      +---------------+-------------+---------+

   A LoWPAN encapsulated LOWPAN_HC1 compressed IPv6 datagram:

      +--------------+------------+---------+
      | HC1 Dispatch | HC1 Header | Payload |
      +--------------+------------+---------+

   A LoWPAN encapsulated LOWPAN_HC1 compressed IPv6 datagram that
   requires mesh addressing:

      +-----------+-------------+--------------+------------+---------+
      | Mesh Type | Mesh Header | HC1 Dispatch | HC1 Header | Payload |
      +-----------+-------------+--------------+------------+---------+

   A LoWPAN encapsulated LOWPAN_HC1 compressed IPv6 datagram that
   requires fragmentation:

      +-----------+-------------+--------------+------------+---------+
      | Frag Type | Frag Header | HC1 Dispatch | HC1 Header | Payload |
      +-----------+-------------+--------------+------------+---------+

   A LoWPAN encapsulated LOWPAN_HC1 compressed IPv6 datagram that
   requires both mesh addressing and fragmentation:

      +-------+-------+-------+-------+---------+---------+---------+
      | M Typ | M Hdr | F Typ | F Hdr | HC1 Dsp | HC1 Hdr | Payload |
      +-------+-------+-------+-------+---------+---------+---------+

   A LoWPAN encapsulated LOWPAN_HC1 compressed IPv6 datagram that
   requires both mesh addressing and a broadcast header to support mesh
   broadcast/multicast:

      +-------+-------+-------+-------+---------+---------+---------+
      | M Typ | M Hdr | B Dsp | B Hdr | HC1 Dsp | HC1 Hdr | Payload |
      +-------+-------+-------+-------+---------+---------+---------+

   When more than one LoWPAN header is used in the same packet, they
   MUST appear in the following order:

      Mesh Addressing Header
      Broadcast Header
      Fragmentation Header

   All protocol datagrams (e.g., IPv6, compressed IPv6 headers, etc)
   SHALL be preceded by one of the valid LoWPAN encapsulation headers,
   examples of which are given above.  This permits uniform software
   treatment of datagrams without regard to the mode of their
   transmission.

   The definition of headers, other than mesh addressing and
   fragmentation, in LoWPAN consists of the dispatch value, the

   definition of the header fields that follow, and their ordering
   constraints relative to all other headers.  Although the header stack
   structure provides a mechanism to address future demands on the
   LoWPAN adaptation layer, it is not intended to provided general
   purpose extensibility.  This format document specifies a small set of
   header types using the header stack for clarity, compactness, and
   othogonality.  All headers used in a LOWPAN adaptation layer SHALL be
   defined in this format document.

5.1.  Dispatch Type and Header

   The dispatch type is defined by a zero-bit as the first bit and a
   one-bit as the second bit.  The dispatch type and header is shown
   here:

                        1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |0 1| Dispatch  |  type-specific header
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   Dispatch               6-bit selector.  Identifies the type of header
                          immediately following the Dispatch Header.

   type-specific header   A header determined by the Dispatch Header.

                    Figure 7: Dispatch Type and Header

   The dispatch value may be treated as an unstructured namespace.  Only
   a few symbols are required to represent current LoWPAN functionality.
   Although some additional savings could be achieved by encoding
   additional functionality into the dispatch byte, these measures would
   tend to constrain the ability to address future alternatives.

          Pattern    Header Type
        +------------+-----------------------------------------------+
        | 00  xxxxxx | NALP       - Not a LoWPAN frame               |
        | 01  000001 | IPv6       - uncompressed IPv6 Addresses      |
        | 01  000010 | LOWPAN_HC1 - LOWPAN_HC1 compressed IPv6       |
        |   ...      | reserved   - Reserved for future use          |
        | 01  010000 | LOWPAN_BC0 - LOWPAN_BC0 broadcast             |
        |   ...      | reserved   - Reserved for future use          |
        | 01  111111 | ESC        - Additional Dispatch byte follows |

   NALP:  Specifies that the following bits are not a part of the LoWPAN
      encapsulation, and any LoWPAN node that encounters a dispatch
      value of 00xxxxxx shall discard the packet.  Other non-LoWPAN
      protocols that wish to coexist with LoWPAN nodes should include a
      byte matching this pattern immediately following the 802.15.4.
      header.

   IPv6:  Specifies that the following header is an uncompressed IPv6
      header [RFC2460].

   LOWPAN_HC1:  Specifies that the following header is a LOWPAN_HC1
      compressd IPv6 header.  This header format is defined in
      Figure 15.

   LOWPAN_BC0:  Specifies that the following header is a LOWPAN_BC0
      header for mesh broadcast/multicast support and is described in
      Section 11.1.

   ESC:  Specifies that the following header is a single 8-bit field for
      the Dispatch value.  Allows support for Dispatch values larger
      than 127.


5.2.  Mesh Addressing Type and Header

   The mesh type is defined by a one-bit and zero-bit as the first two
   bits.  The mesh type and header is shown here:

                           1                   2                   3

                 Figure 9: Mesh Addressing Type and Header

   Field definitions are as follows:

   O: This 1-bit field SHALL be zero if the Originator Address is an
      IEEE extended 64 bit address (EUI-64), or 1 if it is a short 16-
      bit addresses.

   F: This 1-bit field SHALL be zero if the Final Destination Address is
      an IEEE extended 64 bit address (EUI-64), or 1 if it is a short
      16-bit addresses.

      node before sending this packet towards its next hop.  The packet
      is not forwarded any further if Hops Left is decremented to 0.
      The value 0xF is reserved and signifies an 8-bit Deep Hops Left
      field immediately following, and allows a source node to specify a
      hop limit greater than 14 hops.

   Originator Address:  This is the link-layer address of the
      Originator.

   Final Destination Address:  This is the link-layer address of the
      Final Destination.

   Note that the 'O' and 'F' bits allow for a mix of 16 and 64-bit
   addresses.  This is useful at least to allow for mesh layer
   "broadcast", as 802.15.4 broadcast addresses are defined as 16-bit
   short addresses.

   A further discussion of frame delivery within a mesh is in
   Section 11.

5.3.  Fragmentation Type and Header

   If an entire payload (e.g., IPv6) datagram fits within a single
   802.15.4 frame, it is unfragmented and the LoWPAN encapsulation
   should contain no fragmentation header.  If the datagram does not fit
   within a single IEEE 802.15.4 frame, it SHALL be broken into link
   fragments.  The first link fragment SHALL contain the first fragment
   header (defined by one-bit as the first two bits and a zero-bit as
   the third bit) shown below.

                           1                   2

                         Figure 10: First Fragment

   The second and subsequent link fragments (up to and including the
   last) SHALL contain a fragmentation header that conforms to the
   format shown below.

                      Figure 11: Subsequent Fragments

   datagram_tag:  The value of datagram_tag (datagram tag) SHALL be the
      same for all link fragments of a payload (e.g., IPv6) datagram.
      The sender SHALL increment datagram_tag for successive, fragmented
      datagrams.  The incremented value of datagram_tag SHALL wrap from
      1023 back to zero.  This field is 10 bits long, and its initial
      value is not defined.

   datagram_size:  This 11 bit field encodes the size of the entire IP
      payload datagram.  The value of datagram_size SHALL be the same
      for all link fragments of an IP payload datagram.  For IPv6, this
      SHALL be 40 octets (the size of the uncompressed IPv6 header) more
      than the value of Payload Length in the IPv6 header [RFC2460].
      Typically, this field needs to encode a maximum length of 1280
      (IEEE 802.15.4 link MTU as defined in this document), and as much
      as 1500 (the default maximum IPv6 packet size if IPv6
      fragmentation is in use).  Therefore, this field is 11 bits long,
      which works in either case.

      NOTE: This field does not need to be in every packet, as one could
      send it with the first fragment and elide it subsequently.
      However, including it in every link fragment eases the task of
      reassembly in the event that a second (or subsequent) link
      fragment arrives before the first.  In this case, the guarantee of
      learning the datagram_size as soon as any of the fragments arrives
      tells the receiver how much buffer space to set aside as it waits
      for the rest of the fragments.  The format above trades off
      simplicity for efficiency.

   datagram_offset:  This field is present only in the second and
      subsequent link fragments and SHALL specify the offset, in
      increments of 8 octets, of the fragment from the beginning of the
      payload datagram.  The first octet of the datagram (e.g., the
      start of the IPv6 header) has an offset of zero; the implicit
      value of datagram_offset in the first link fragment is zero.  This
      field is 8 bits long.


   The recipient of link fragments SHALL use (1) the sender's 802.15.4
   source address (or the Originator Address if a Mesh Addressing field
   is present), (2) the destination's 802.15.4 address (or the Final

   Destination address if a Mesh Addressing field is present), (3)
   datagram_size and (4) datagram_tag to identify all the link fragments
   that belong to a given datagram.

   Upon receipt of a link fragment, the recipient starts constructing
   the original unfragmented packet whose size is datagram_size.  It
   uses the datagram_offset field to determine the location of the
   individual fragments within the original unfragmented packet.  For
   example, it may place the data payload (except the encapsulation
   header) within a payload datagram reassembly buffer at the location
   specified by datagram_offset.  The size of the reassembly buffer
   SHALL be determined from datagram_size.

   If a link fragment is received that overlaps another fragment as
   identified above and differs in either the size or datagram_offset of
   the overlapped fragment, the fragment(s) already accumulated in the
   reassembly buffer SHALL be discarded.  A fresh reassembly may be
   commenced with the most recently received link fragment.  Fragment
   overlap is determined by the combination of datagram_offset from the
   encapsulation header and "Frame Length" from the 802.15.4 PPDU packet
   header.

   Upon detection of a IEEE 802.15.4 Disassociation event, fragment
   recipients SHOULD discard all link fragments of all partially
   reassembled payload datagrams, and fragment senders SHOULD discard
   all not yet transmitted link fragments of all partially transmitted
   payload (e.g., IPv6) datagrams.  Similarly, when a node first
   receives a fragment with a given datagram_tag, it starts a reassembly
   timer.  When this time expires, if the entire packet has not been
   reassembled, the existing fragments SHOULD be discarded and the
   reassembly state SHOULD be flushed.  The reassembly timeout MUST be
   set to a maximum of 60 seconds (this is also the timeout in the IPv6
   reassembly procedure [RFC2460] ).


6.  Stateless Address Autoconfiguration

   This section defines how to obtain an IPv6 interface identifier.

   The Interface Identifier [RFC4291] for an IEEE 802.15.4 interface may
   be based on the EUI-64 identifier [EUI64] assigned to the IEEE
   802.15.4 device.  In this case, the Interface Identifier is formed
   from the EUI-64 according to the "IPv6 over Ethernet" specification
   [RFC2464].

   All 802.15.4 devices have an IEEE EUI-64 address, but 16-bit short
   addresses (Section 3 and Section 12) are also possible.  In these
   cases, a "pseudo 48-bit address" is formed as follows.  First, the



Montenegro, et al.       Expires August 6, 2007                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft           IPv6 over IEEE 802.15.4           February 2007


   left-most 32 bits are formed by concatenating 16 zero bits to the 16-
   bit PAN ID (alternatively, if no PAN ID is known, 16 zero bits may be
   used).  This produces a 32-bit field as follows:

      16_bit_PAN:16_zero_bits

   Then, these 32 bits are concatenated with the 16-bit short address.
   This produces a 48-bit address as follows:

      32_bits_as_specified_previously:16_bit_short_address

   The interface identifier is formed from this 48-bit address as per
   the "IPv6 over Ethernet" specification.  However, in the resultant
   interface identifier, the "Universal/Local" (U/L) bit SHALL be set to
   0 in keeping with the fact that this is not a globally unique value.
   For either address format, all zero addresses MUST NOT be used.

   A different MAC address set manually or by software MAY be used to
   derive the Interface Identifier.  If such a MAC address is used, its
   global uniqueness property should be reflected in the value of the
   U/L bit.

   An IPv6 address prefix used for stateless autoconfiguration
   [I-D.ietf-ipv6-rfc2462bis] of an IEEE 802.15.4 interface MUST have a
   length of 64 bits.


7.  IPv6 Link Local Address

   The IPv6 link-local address [RFC4291] for an IEEE 802.15.4 interface
   is formed by appending the Interface Identifier, as defined above, to
   the prefix FE80::/64.

8.  Unicast Address Mapping

   The address resolution procedure for mapping IPv6 non-multicast
   addresses into IEEE 802.15.4 link-layer addresses follows the general
   description in section 7.2 of [I-D.ietf-ipv6-2461bis], unless

   Length:  This is the length of this option (including the type and

      if using EUI-64 addresses, or 1 if using 16-bit short addresses.

   IEEE 802.15.4 Address:  The 64-bit IEEE 802.15.4 address, or the 16-
      bit short address (as per the format in Section 9), in canonical
      bit order.  This is the address the interface currently responds
      to.  This address may be different from the built-in address used
      to derive the Interface Identifier, because of privacy or security
      (e.g., of neighbor discovery) considerations.



9.  Multicast Address Mapping

   An IPv6 packet with a multicast destination address DST, consisting
   of the sixteen octets DST[1] through DST[16], is transmitted to the
   following 802.15.4 16-bit multicast address:

                       0                   1
                       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
                      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                      |1 0 0|DST[15]* |   DST[16]     |
                      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                                 Figure 14

   Here, DST[15]* refers to the last 5 bits in octet DST[15], that is,
   bits 3-7 within DST[15].  The initial 3-bit pattern of "100" follows
   the 16-bit address format for multicast addresses (Section 12).

   This allows for multicast support within 6LoWPAN networks, but the
   full specification of such support is out of scope of this document.
   Example mechanisms are: flooding, controlled flooding, unicasting to
   the PAN coordinator, etc.  It is expected that this would be
   specified by the different mesh routing mechanisms.


10.  Header Compression

   There is much published and in-progress standardization work on
   header compression.  Nevertheless, header compression for IPv6 over
   IEEE 802.15.4 has differing constraints summarized as follows:






Montenegro, et al.       Expires August 6, 2007                [Page 15]

Internet-Draft           IPv6 over IEEE 802.15.4           February 2007


      Existing work assumes that there are many flows between any two
      devices.  Here, we assume that most of the time there will be only
      one flow, and this allows a very simple and low context flavor of
      header compression.

      Given the very limited packet sizes, it is highly desirable to
      integrate layer 2 with layer 3 compression, something
      traditionally not done (although now changing due to the ROHC
      working group).

      It is expected that IEEE 802.15.4 devices will be deployed in
      multi-hop networks.  However, header compression in a mesh departs
      from the usual point-to-point link scenario in which the
      compressor and decompressor are in direct and exclusive
      communication with each other.  In an IEEE 802.15.4 network, it is
      highly desirable for a device to be able to send header compressed
      packets via any of its neighbors, with as little preliminary
      context-building as possible.

      Preliminary context is often required.  If so, it is highly
      desirable to allow building it by not relying exclusively on the
      in-line negotiation phase.  For example, if we assume there is
      some manual configuration phase that precedes deployment (perhaps
      with human involvement), then one should be able to leverage this
      phase to set up context such that the first packet sent will
      already be compressed.

   Any new packets formats required by header compression reuse the
   basic packet formats defined in Section 5 by using different dispatch
   values.

10.1.  Encoding of IPv6 Header Fields

   By virtue of having joined the same 6LoWPAN network, devices share
   some state.  This makes it possible to compress headers even in the
   absence of the customary context-building phase.  Thus, the following
   common IPv6 header values may be compressed from the onset: Version
   is IPv6; both IPv6 source and destination addresses are link local;
   the IPv6 interface identifiers (bottom 64 bits) for the source or
   destination addresses can be inferred from the layer two source and
   destination addresses (of course, this is only possible for interface
   identifiers derived from an underlying 802.15.4 MAC address); the
   packet length can be inferred either from layer two ("Frame Length"
   in the IEEE 802.15.4 PPDU) or from the "datagram_size" field in the
   fragment header (if present); both the Traffic Class and the Flow
   Label are zero; and the Next Header is UDP, ICMP or TCP.  The only
   field in the IPv6 header that always needs to be carried in full is
   the Hop Limit (8 bits).  Depending on how closely the packet matches



Montenegro, et al.       Expires August 6, 2007                [Page 16]

Internet-Draft           IPv6 over IEEE 802.15.4           February 2007


   this common case, different fields may not be compressible thus
   needing to be carried "in-line" as well (Section 10.3.1).  This
   common IPv6 header (as mentioned above) can be compressed to 2 octets
   (1 octet for the HC1 encoding and 1 octet for the Hop Limit), instead
   of 40 octets.  Such a packet is compressible via the LOWPAN_HC1
   format by using a Dispatch value of LOWPAN_HC1 followed by a
   LOWPAN_HC1 header "HC1 encoding" field (8 bits) to encode the
   different combinations as shown below.  This header may be preceded
   by a fragmentation header, which may be preceded by a mesh header.

                           1                   2                   3

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

         Figure 15: LOWPAN_HC1 (common compressed header encoding)

   As can be seen below (bit 7), an HC2 encoding may follow an HC1
   octet.  In this case, the non-compressed fields follow the HC2
   encoding field Section 10.3.

   The address fields encoded by "HC1 encoding" are interpreted as
   follows:

      PI:  Prefix carried in-line (Section 10.3.1).
      PC:  Prefix compressed (link-local prefix assumed).
      II:  Interface identifier carried in-line (Section 10.3.1).
      IC:  Interface identifier elided (derivable from the corresponding
         link-layer address).  If applied to the interface identifier of
         either the source or destination address when routing in a mesh
         (Section 11), the corresponding link-layer address is that
         found in the "Mesh Addressing" field (Section 5.2).

   The "HC1 encoding" is shown below (starting with bit 0 and ending at
   bit 7):

      IPv6 source address (bits 0 and 1):
         00:  PI, II
         01:  PI, IC
         10:  PC, II
         11:  PC, IC

      IPv6 destination address (bits 2 and 3):

         00:  PI, II
         01:  PI, IC
         10:  PC, II
         11:  PC, IC

      Traffic Class and Flow Label (bit 4):
         0: not compressed, full 8 bits for Traffic Class and 20 bits
            for Flow Label are sent
         1: Traffic Class and Flow Label are zero

      Next Header (bits 5 and 6):
         00:  not compressed, full 8 bits are sent
         01:  UDP
         10:  ICMP
         11:  TCP

      HC2 encoding(bit 7):
         0: No more header compression bits
         1: HC1 encoding immediately followed by more header compression
            bits per HC2 encoding format.  Bits 5 and 6 determine which
            of the possible HC2 encodings apply (e.g., UDP, ICMP or TCP
            encodings).

10.2.  Encoding of UDP Header Fields

   Bits 5 and 6 of the LOWPAN_HC1 allows compressing the Next Header
   field in the IPv6 header (for UDP, TCP and ICMP).  Further
   compression of each of these protocol headers is also possible.  This
   section explains how the UDP header itself may be compressed.  The
   HC2 encoding in this section is the HC_UDP encoding, and it only
   applies if bits 5 and 6 in HC1 indicate that the protocol that
   follows the IPv6 header is UDP.  The HC_UDP encoding (Figure 16)
   allows compressing the following fields in the UDP header: source
   port, destination port and length.  The UDP header's checksum field
   is not compressed and is therefore carried in full.  The scheme
   defined below allows compressing the UDP header to 4 octets instead
   of the original 8 octets.

   The only UDP header field whose value may be deduced from information
   available elsewhere is the Length.  The other fields must be carried
   in-line either in full or in a partially compressed manner
   (Section 10.3.2).

         Figure 16: HC_UDP (UDP common compressed header encoding)

   The "HC_UDP encoding" for UDP is shown below (starting with bit 0 and
   ending at bit 7):

      UDP source port (bit 0):
         0: Not compressed, carried "in-line" (Section 10.3.2)
         1: Compressed to 4 bits.  The actual 16-bit source port is
            obtained by calculating: P + short_port value.  P is a
            predetermined port number with value TBD.  The short_port is
            expressed as a 4-bit value which is carried "in-line"
            (Section 10.3.2)

      UDP destination port (bit 1):
         0: Not compressed, carried "in-line" (Section 10.3.2)
         1: Compressed to 4 bits.  The actual 16-bit destination port is
            obtained by calculating: P + short_port value.  P is a
            predetermined port number with value TBD.  The short_port is
            expressed as a 4-bit value which is carried "in-line"
            (Section 10.3.2)

      Length (bit 2):
         0: not compressed, carried "in-line" (Section 10.3.2)
         1: compressed, length computed from IPv6 header length
            information.  The value of the UDP length field is equal to
            the Payload Length from the IPv6 header, minus the length of
            any extension headers present between the IPv6 header and
            the UDP header.

      Reserved (bit 3 through 7)

10.3.  Non-Compressed Fields

10.3.1.  Non-Compressed IPv6 Fields

   This scheme allows the IPv6 header to be compressed to different
   degrees.  Hence, instead of the entire (standard) IPv6 header, only
   non-compressed fields need to be sent.  The subsequent header (as
   specified by the Next Header field in the original IPv6 header)
   immediately follows the IPv6 non-compressed fields.

   Uncompressed IPv6 addressing is described by a dispatch type



Montenegro, et al.       Expires August 6, 2007                [Page 19]

Internet-Draft           IPv6 over IEEE 802.15.4           February 2007


   containing an IPv6 dispatch value followed by the uncompressed IPv6
   header.  This dispatch type may be preceded by additional LoWPAN
   headers.

   The non-compressed IPv6 field that MUST be always present is the Hop
   Limit (8 bits).  This field MUST always follow the encoding fields
   (e.g., "HC1 encoding" as shown in Figure 15), perhaps including other
   future encoding fields).  Other non-compressed fields MUST follow the
   Hop Limit as implied by the "HC1 encoding" in the exact same order as
   shown above (Section 10.1): source address prefix (64 bits) and/or
   interface identifier (64 bits), destination address prefix (64 bits)
   and/or interface identifier (64 bits), Traffic Class (8 bits), Flow
   Label (20 bits) and Next Header (8 bits).  The actual next header
   (e.g., UDP, TCP, ICMP, etc) follows the non-compressed fields.

10.3.2.  Non-Compressed and partially compressed UDP fields

   This scheme allows the UDP header to be compressed to different
   degrees.  Hence, instead of the entire (standard) UDP header, only
   non-compressed or partially compressed fields need to be sent.

   The non-compressed or partially compressed fields in the UDP header
   MUST always follow the IPv6 header and any of its associated in-line
   fields.  Any UDP header in-line fields present MUST appear in the
   same order as the corresponding fields appear in a normal UDP header
   [RFC0768], e.g., source port, destination port, length and checksum.
   If either the source or destination ports are in "short_port"
   notation (as indicated in the compressed UDP header), then instead of
   taking 16 bits, the inline port numbers take 4 bits.


11.  Frame Delivery in a Link-Layer Mesh

   Even though 802.15.4 networks are expected to commonly use mesh
   routing, the IEEE 802.15.4-2003 specification [ieee802.15.4] does not
   define such capability.  In such cases, Full Function Devices (FFDs)
   run an ad hoc or mesh routing protocol to populate their routing
   tables (outside the scope of this document).  In such mesh scenarios,
   two devices do not require direct reachability in order to
   communicate.  Of these devices, the sender is known as the
   "Originator", and the receiver is known as the "Final Destination".
   An originator device may use other intermediate devices as forwarders
   towards the final destination.  In order to achieve such frame
   delivery using unicast, it is necessary to include the link-layer
   addresses of the originator and final destinations, in addition to
   the hop-by-hop source and destination.

   This section defines how to effect delivery of layer 2 frames in a



Montenegro, et al.       Expires August 6, 2007                [Page 20]

Internet-Draft           IPv6 over IEEE 802.15.4           February 2007


   mesh, given a target "Final Destination" link-layer address.

   Mesh delivery is enabled by including a Mesh Addressing header prior
   to any other headers of the LoWPAN encapsulation (Section 5),
   unfragmented and fragmented, a full-blown IPv6 header, or a
   compressed IPv6 header as per Section 10, or any others defined
   elsewhere.

   If a node wishes to use a default mesh forwarder to deliver a packet
   (i.e., because it does not have direct reachability to the
   destination), it MUST include a Mesh Addressing header with the
   originator's link-layer address set to its own, and the final
   destination's link-layer address set to the packet's ultimate
   destination.  It sets the source address in the 802.15.4 header to
   its own link-layer address, and puts the forwarder's link-layer
   address in the 802.15.4 header's destination address field.  Finally,
   it transmits the packet.

   Similarly, if a node receives a frame with a Mesh Addressing header,
   it must look at the Mesh Addressing header's "Final Destination"
   field to determine the real destination.  If the node is itself the
   final destination, it consumes the packet as per normal delivery.  If
   it is not the final destination, the device then reduces the "Hops
   Left" field, and if the result is zero, discards the packet.
   Otherwise, the node consults its link-layer routing table, determines
   what the next hop towards the final destination should be, and puts
   that address in the destination address field of the 802.15.4 header.
   Finally, the node changes the source address in the 802.15.4 header
   to its own link-layer address and transmits the packet.

   Whereas a node must participate in a mesh routing protocol to be a
   forwarder, no such requirement exists for simply using mesh
   forwarding.  Only "Full Function Devices" (FFDs) are expected to
   participate as routers in a mesh.  "Reduced Function Devices" (RFDs)
   limit themselves to discovering FFDs and using them for all their
   forwarding, in a manner similar to how IP hosts typically use default
   routers to forward all their off-link traffic.  For an RFD using mesh
   delivery, the "forwarder" is always the appropriate FFD.

11.1.  LoWPAN Broadcast

   Additional mesh routing functionality is encoded using a routing
   header immediately following the Mesh header.  In particular, a
   broadcast header consists of a LOWPAN_BC0 dispatch followed by a
   sequence number field.  The sequence number is used to detect
   duplicate packets (and hopefully suppress them).

   Field definitions are as follows:

      originator whenever it sends a new mesh broadcast or multicast
      packet.  Full specification of how to handle this field is out of
      scope of this document.


   Further implications of such mesh-layer broadcast, e.g., whether it
   maps to a controlled flooding mechanism or its role in, say, topology
   discovery, is out of scope of this document.

   Additional mesh routing capabilities, such as specifying the mesh
   routing protocol, source routing, and so on may be expressed by
   defining additional routing headers that preceed the fragmentation or
   addressing header in the header stack.  The full specification of
   such mesh routing capabilities are out of scope of this document.


12.  IANA Considerations

   This document creates two new IANA registries, as discussed below.
   Future assignments in these registries are to be coordinated via IANA
   under the policy of "Specification Required" [RFC2434].  It is
   expected that this policy will allow for other (non-IETF)
   organizations to more easily obtain assignments.

   This document creates a new IANA registry for the Dispatch type field
   shown in the header definitions Section 5.  This document defines the
   values IPv6, LOWPAN_HC1 header compression, BC0 broadcast and two
   escape patterns (NALP to indicate not a LOWPAN frame and ESC to allow
   additional dispatch bytes).  This document defines this field to be 8
   bits long.  The values 00xxxxxx being reserved and not used, this
   allows for a total of 192 different values, which should be more than
   enough.  If header compression formats in addition to HC1 are defined
   or if additional TCP, ICMP HC2 formats are defined, it is expected
   that these will use reserved dispatch values following LOWPAN_HC1.
   If additional mesh delivery formats are defined these will use
   reserved values following LOWPAN_BC0.

   This registry MUST include the addresses 0xffff (16-bit broadcast
   address accepted by all devices currently listening to the channel)
   and 0xfffe as defined in [ieee802.15.4].  Additionally, within
   6LoWPAN networks, 16-bit short addresses MUST follow this format
   (referring to bit fields in the order from 0 to 7), where "x" is a
   place holder for an unspecified bit value:

   Range 1, Oxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx:  The first bit (bit 0) SHALL be zero if
      the 16-bit address is a unicast address.  This leaves 15 bits for
      the actual address.

   Range 2, 100xxxxxxxxxxxxx:  Bits 0,1 and 2 SHALL follow this pattern
      if the 16-bit address is a multicast address (see Section 9).
      This leaves 13 bits for the actual multicast address.

   Range 3, 101xxxxxxxxxxxxx:  This pattern for bits 0,1 and 2 is
      reserved.  Any future assignment shall follow the policy mentioned
      above.

   Range 4, 110xxxxxxxxxxxxx:  This pattern for bits 0,1 and 2 is
      reserved.  Any future assignment shall follow the policy mentioned
      above.

   Range 5, 111xxxxxxxxxxxxx:  This pattern for bits 0,1 and 2 is
      reserved.  Any future assignment shall follow the policy mentioned
      above.


   This document requests an IANA assignment of a port number P, for use
   with UDP header compression (Section 10.2).  This port number P is
   used as the base to which the "short_port" 4-bit values are added in
   order to obtain the actual UDP port used.

13.  Security Considerations

   The method of derivation of Interface Identifiers from EUI-64 MAC
   addresses is intended to preserve global uniqueness when possible.
   However, there is no protection from duplication through accident or
   forgery.

   Neighbor Discovery in IEEE 802.15.4 links may be susceptible to
   threats as detailed in [RFC3756].  Mesh routing is expected to be
   common in IEEE 802.15.4 networks.  This implies additional threats
   due to ad hoc routing as per [KW03].  IEEE 802.15.4 provides some
   capability for link-layer security.  Users are urged to make use of
   such provisions if at all possible and practical.  Doing so will
   alleviate the threats referred to above.

   A sizeable portion of IEEE 802.15.4 devices is expected to always
   communicate within their PAN (i.e., within their link, in IPv6
   terms).  In response to cost and power consumption considerations,
   and in keeping with the IEEE 802.15.4 model of "Reduced Function
   Devices" (RFDs), these devices will typically implement the minimum
   set of features necessary.  Accordingly, security for such devices
   may rely quite strongly on the mechanisms defined at the link-layer
   by IEEE 802.15.4.  The latter, however, only defines the AES modes
   for authentication or encryption of IEEE 802.15.4 frames, and does
   not, in particular, specify key management (presumably group
   oriented).  Other issues to address in real deployments relate to
   secure configuration and management.  Whereas such a complete picture
   is out of scope of this document, it is imperative that IEEE 802.15.4
   networks be deployed with such considerations in mind.  Of course, it
   is also expected that some IEEE 802.15.4 devices (the so-called "Full
   Function Devices", or "FFDs") will implement coordination or
   integration functions.  These may communicate regularly with off-link
   IPv6 peers (in addition to the more common on-link exchanges).  Such
   IPv6 devices are expected to secure their end-to-end communications
   with the usual mechanisms (e.g., IPsec, TLS, etc).

Appendix A.  Alternatives for Delivery of Frames in a Mesh

   Before settling on the mechanism finally adopted for delivery in a
   mesh (Section 11), several alternatives were considered.  In addition
   to the hop-by-hop source and destination link-layer addresses,
   delivering a packet in a LoWPAN mesh requires the end-to-end
   originator and destination addresses.  These could be expressed
   either as layer 2 or as layer 3 (i.e., IP ) addresses.  In the latter
   case, there would be no need to provide any additional header support
   in this document (i.e., within the LoWPAN header itself).  The link-
   layer destination address would point to the next hop destination
   address while the IP header destination address would point to the
   final destination (IP) address (possibly multiple hops away from the
   source), and similarly for the source addresses.  Thus, while
   forwarding data, the single-hop source and destination addresses
   would change at each hop (always pointing to the node doing the
   forwarding and the "best" next link-layer hop, respectively), while
   the source and destination IP addresses would remain unchanged.
   Notice that if an IP packet is fragmented, the individual fragments
   may arrive at any node out of order.  If the initial fragment (which
   contains the IP header) is delayed for some reason, a node that
   receives a subsequent fragment would lack the required information.
   It would be forced to wait until it receives the IP header (within
   the first fragment) before being able to forward the fragment any
   further.  This imposes some additional buffering requirements on
   intermediate nodes.  Additionally, such a specification would only
   work for one type of LoWPAN payload: IPv6.  In general, it would have
   to be adapted for any other payload, and would require that payload
   to provide its own end-to-end addressing information.

Internet-Draft           IPv6 over IEEE 802.15.4           February 2007


   On the other hand, the approach finally followed (Section 11) creates
   a mesh at the LoWPAN layer (below layer 3).  Accordingly, link-layer
   originator and final destination address are included within the
   LoWPAN header.  This enables mesh delivery for any protocol or
   application layered on the LoWPAN adaptation layer (Section 5).  For
   IPv6 as supported in this document, another advantage of expressing
   the originator and final destinations as layer 2 addresses is that
   the IPv6 addresses can be compressed as per the header compression
   specified in Section 10.  Furthermore, the number of octets needed to
   maintain routing tables is reduced due to the smaller size of
   802.15.4 addresses (either 64 bits or 16 bits) as compared to IPv6
   addresses (128 bits).  A disadvantage is that applications on top of
   IP do not address packets to link-layer destination addresses, but to
   IP (layer 3) destination addresses.  Thus, given an IP address, there
   is a need to resolve the corresponding link-layer address.
   Accordingly, a mesh routing specification needs to clarify the
   Neighbor Discovery implications, although in some special cases, it
   may be possible to derive a device's address at layer 2 from its
   address at layer 3 (and viceversa).  Such complete specification is
   outside the scope of this document.

Internet-Draft           IPv6 over IEEE 802.15.4           February 2007


      Editorial nits and corrections.


   Changes up to version draft-ietf-6lowpan-format-05.txt are as
   follows:

      Added some padding bits to the first and subsequent fragment
      formats to align on an octet boundary.

      Header compression may result in alignment not falling on an octet
      boundary.  Since hardware typically cannot transmit units less
      than an octet, added text to the effect that one lays out the
      contiguous compressed headers and then zero bits SHOULD BE added
      as appropriate to align to an octet boundary.

      Added how to distinguish between the multicast and the unicast
      formats for the mesh delivery field.  We use one of the 5 reserved
      bits to signal if the bcast/mcast mesh delivery format is being
      used, and we called it the 'B' ("broadcast") bit.  So no change to
      the mesh delivery fields is required.  Since the reserved bits are
      common to all three lowpan header formats, the 'B' bit applies to
      all.


   Changes from version draft-ietf-6lowpan-format-02.txt to version
   draft-ietf-6lowpan-format-03.txt are as follows:

      Interface Identifier derivation using 16-bit short addresses now
      using the PAN ID as well.

      Word of caution on the transient nature of 16 bit short addresses.

      Reassembly now also keying on destination and datagram_size.

      Mesh delivery header now allowing mix of 16/64 bit addresses.
      This leaves 6 bits for hops_left (64 hops is plenty).

      Added optional Multicast Address mapping patterned after that of
      ethernet.

      Clarified that all zero addresses must not be used (for either 16
      or 64 bit formats).

      Added address format section to IANA considerations to define
      unicast, multicast and reserved address formats.

      Added Mesh Broadcast or Multicast Delivery Field.

      Created a new section on Addressing Modes.

      Sundry editorial changes.

   Changes from version draft-ietf-6lowpan-format-01.txt to version
   draft-ietf-6lowpan-format-02.txt are as follows:

      Further details on broadcast by using PAN-specific broadcast.

      Sundry editorial changes.

   Changes from version draft-ietf-6lowpan-format-00.txt to version
   draft-ietf-6lowpan-format-01.txt are as follows:

      Added a reassembly timeout of 15 sec.

      Added support for 16-bit "short" addresses.

      datagram tag now at 10 bits protocol_type and datagram offset both
      went from 11 to 8 bits (which is still enough for the format, and
      which implies counting offset in units of 8 octets for the
      latter).

      Addition of the originator's link-layer source address to the
      "Mesh Delivery" header.

      Changed name of "Final Destination" header to "Mesh Delivery"
      header.

      Further clarification on mesh delivery.

      Sundry editorial changes.

   Changes from version
   draft-montenegro-lowpan-ipv6-over-802.15.4-02.txt to version
   draft-ietf-6lowpan-format-00.txt are as follows:

      The LoWPAN encapsulation was modified to allow 11 bits of protocol
      type (prot_type field).  Because of this, the minimum overhead
      grew from 1 octet to 2 octets.  This was done in order to allow
      more protocol types as the previous format started with a field
      only 5 bits wide.  Whereas growing it to 7 bits was possible in
      the future, this would always entail 2 octets of overhead for the
      longer protocol types to be used.

      The 'M' bit had been left out of the 3rd packet format (for
      subsequent fragments).  Corrected this oversight.  This means that
      the fragment tag lost one bit.

      Sundry editorial changes.
