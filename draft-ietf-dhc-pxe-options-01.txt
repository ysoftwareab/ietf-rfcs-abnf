Internet-Draft              DHCP PXE Options                January 2005


1.  Introduction

   These DHCP options [RFC2131] are being widely used by PXE compliant
   clients to uniquely identify booting client machines themselves and
   their pre-OS runtime environment so the DHCP and/or PXE boot server
   can return the correct OS bootstrap image (or pre-boot application)
   name and server to the client.  In the past, this work was done by
   examining the network MAC address in the "chaddr" field in the BOOTP/
   DHCP header and keeping a database of MAC addresses on the BOOTP/DHCP
   server.  This was deemed insufficient for large and complex networks
   for two main reasons.  1) Multiple laptops could end up with the same
   MAC address if the NIC was in a shared docking station.  2) Multiple
   network devices and MAC addresses could be used by one machine for
   redundancy or because of repairs.  Another issue that came up was the
   machine that could change its pre-OS runtime environment.  This issue
   caused the creation of another new option to identify the runtime
   environment so the correct binary image could be matched up with the
   booting machine.  These options are defined in the PXE [pxe] and EFI
   [efi] specifications and are being documented in this draft for
   completeness within the IETF.  Comments about this Internet Draft
   should be sent to the dhcwg@ietf.org mailing list.

2.  Revision history

   Revision 00 to Revision 01

   o  Changed all occurrences of "suboption" to "option".
   o  Re-worded first sentence of Introduction to clarify that these
      options are in wide use by PXE clients.
   o  Clarified external document references.
   o  Added description of site specific options 128 through 135.
   o  Added IANA Considerations and Security Considerations sections.

3.  Option Definitions

   There are three DHCP options [RFC2132]defined for use by PXE clients.

3.1  Client System Architecture Type  Option Definition

   The format of the option is:


    Code Len  16-bit Type
   +----+---+------+------+
   | 93 | n |  n1  |  n2  |
   +----+---+------+------+

   Octet "n" MUST be an even number greater than zero.  Clients that

   support more than one architecture type MAY include a list of these
   types in their initial DHCP and PXE boot server packets.  The list of
   supported architecture types MAY be reduced in any packet exchange
   between the client and server(s).  Octets "n1" and "n2" encode a
   16-bit architecture type identifier that describes the pre-boot
   runtime environment(s) of the client machine.

   As of the writing of this document the following pre-boot
   architecture types have been requested.

   Type   Architecture Name
   ----   -----------------
     0    Intel x86PC
     1    NEC/PC98
     2    EFI Itanium
     3    DEC Alpha
     4    Arc x86
     5    Intel Lean Client
     6    EFI IA32

   This option must be present in all DHCP and PXE packets sent by PXE
   compliant clients and servers.

3.2  Client Network Interface Identifier Option Definition

   The format of the option is:
    Code  Len  Type Major Minor
   +----+-----+----+-----+-----+
   | 94 |  3  |  t |  M  |  m  |
   +----+-----+----+-----+-----+

   Octet "t" encodes a network interface type.  For now the only
   supported value is 1 for UNDI (Universal Network Device Interface).
   Octets "M" and "m" describe the interface revision.  To encode the
   UNDI revision of 2.11, "M" would set to 2 and "m" would be set to 11
   (0x0B).

Internet-Draft              DHCP PXE Options                January 2005


   Revision  Description
   --------  -----------
   < 2.00    LANDesk service agent boot ROMs.  No PXE APIs.

     2.00    First generation PXE boot ROMs.  (PXENV+)  [pxe]

     2.01    Second generation PXE boot ROMs.  (!PXE)   [pxe]

     3.00    32/64-bit UNDI specification.  (Alpha)  [efi]
             EFI boot services driver only.  No EFI runtime support.

     3.10    32/64-bit UNDI specification.  (Beta)  [efi]
             First generation EFI runtime driver support.

     3.20    32/64-bit UNDI specification.  (Release)  [efi]
             Second generation EFI runtime driver support.

   This option must be present in all DHCP and PXE packets sent by PXE
   compliant clients and servers.

3.3  Client Machine Identifier Option Definition

   The format of the option is:
    Code  Len  Type  Machine Identifier
   +----+-----+----+-----+ . . . +-----+
   | 97 |  n  |  t |     | . . . |     |
   +----+-----+----+-----+ . . . +-----+

   Octet "t" describes the type of the machine identifier in the
   remaining octets in this option.  0 (zero) is the only defined value
   for this octet at the present time and it describes the remaining
   octets as a 16-octet GUID.  Octet "n" is 17 for type 0.  (One
   definition of GUID can be found in Appendix A in the EFI
   specification [efi].)

   This option must be present in all DHCP and PXE packets sent by PXE
   compliant clients and servers.

3.4  Site Specific Options Being Requested By PXE Client

   All compliant PXE clients MUST include a request for DHCP options 128
   through 135 in all DHCP and PXE packets.  The format and contents of
   these options are NOT defined by the PXE specification.  These
   options MAY be present in the DHCP and PXE boot server replies and
   are meant for use by the downloaded network bootstrap programs.
   These options are NOT used by the PXE boot ROMs.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines two new name spaces associated with PXE
   compliant client machines: Client System Architecture Type and Client
   Network Interface Identifier.  IANA is requested to manage a registry
   of values for these new name spaces, which are described in sections
   2.1 and 2.2.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document in and by itself provides no security, nor does it
   impact existing security.
