                                Abstract

     This document defines the procedure to register RTP Payload Formats
     as audio, video or other MIME subtype names.  This is useful in a
     text-based format or control protocol to identify the type of an
     RTP transmission.  This document also registers all the RTP payload
     formats defined in the RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences
     as MIME subtypes.  Some of these may also be used for transfer
     modes other than RTP.

1.  Introduction

The MIME registration procedure described in RFC 2048 [1] was originally
designed for transport of multimedia information via asynchronous Inter-
net mail, but the MIME namespace now provides identification for other
transport modes as well.  This document defines the procedure to regis-
ter MIME subtype names for use with the Real-time Transport Protocol
(RTP), RFC 1889 (under revision as draft-ietf-avt-rtp-new [2]), to iden-
tify RTP payload formats.

This document also registers all the RTP payload formats defined in the
RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences, RFC 1890 (under revision as
draft-ietf-avt-profile-new [3]), as MIME subtypes under the "audio" and
"video" MIME types.

[As this document is completed for publication as an RFC, it may be
appropriate to add specifications in some of the registrations for how
the media encodings associated with those RTP payload formats should be
transferred under more traditional MIME transport modes as well.  That
has not been done yet.]

1.1.  Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [4] and indicate
requirement levels for implementations compliant with this specifica-
tion.

2.  Procedure For Registering MIME Types for RTP Payload Types

Registering an RTP payload type as MIME type follows the same procedures
as described in RFC 2048 and uses the registration template shown in
Section 2.8 of RFC 2048.  Some additional parameters are required to
specify how a particular payload format is transported over RTP:

     Published specification
          A description of encoding and a specification of the payload
          format must be provided, usually by reference to an RTP pay-
          load format specification RFC.  That RFC may be separate, or
          the MIME subtype registration may be incorporated into the
          payload format specification RFC.  The payload format specifi-
          cation MUST include the RTP timestamp clock rate (or multiple
          rates for audio encodings with multiple sampling rates).

          A reference to a further description of the data compression
          format itself should be provided, if available.

Internet Draft       draft-ietf-avt-rtp-mime-04.txt           March 2001


     Required parameters
          If the payload format does not have a fixed RTP timestamp
          clock rate, then a "rate" parameter is required.  A particular
          payload format may have additional required parameters.

     Optional parameters
          Most audio payload formats can have an optional "channels"
          parameter to specify the number of audio channels included in
          the transmission.  Any payload format, but most likely audio
          formats, may also include an optional "ptime" parameter to
          specify the length of time in milliseconds represented by the
          media in a packet.

          A particular payload format may have additional optional
          parameters.

     Encoding considerations
          The fact that the type can be transferred via RTP MUST be
          noted.

Depending on whether the type has already been registered for transfer
with a non-RTP protocol (e.g. MIME mail or http) or not, several differ-
ent cases can occur:

     a) Not yet registered as a MIME type

        A new registration should be constructed using the MIME regis-
        tration template.  The registration may specify transfer via
        other means in addition to RTP if that is feasible and desired.
        The encoding considerations must specify how the type is trans-
        ferred via RTP.

        Optional parameters may be defined as needed, and it must be
        clearly stated whether to which mode(s) of transfer the parame-
        ters apply.

     b) MIME type exists for a non-RTP protocol

        The encoding considerations of the existing type should be
        changed to indicate that the type can also be transferred via
        RTP.

        RTP-specific parameters may be added, and it must be clearly
        stated that these are only to be used when the media type is
        transmitted via RTP transport.

     c) Update an existing MIME type for RTP to be used for a non-RTP
        protocol

        The encoding considerations of the existing type should be
        changed to indicate that the type can also be transferred via a
        non-RTP protocol (e.g. SMTP, HTTP).

        Non-RTP-specific parameters can be added, and it must be clearly
        stated that these are only to be used when the media type is
        transmitted via a non-RTP transport.

3.  Mapping to SDP Parameters

The representation of a MIME media type is specified in the syntax of
the Content-Type header field in RFC 2045 [5] as follows:

     type "/" subtype  *(";" parameter)

Parameters may be required for a particular type or subtype or they may
be optional.  For media types which represent RTP payload formats, the
parameters "rate", "channels" and "ptime" have general definitions
(given above) that may apply across types and subtypes.  The format for
a parameter is specified in RFC 2045 as

     attribute "=" value

where attribute is the parameter name and the permissible values are
specified for each parameter.

The information carried in the media type string has a specific mapping
to fields in the Session Description Protocol (SDP), RFC 2327 [6], which
is commonly used to describe RTP sessions.  The mapping is as follows:

    o  The MIME type (e.g., audio) goes in SDP "m=" as the media name.

    o  The MIME subtype (payload format) goes in SDP "a=rtpmap" as the
       encoding name.

    o  The general (possibly optional) parameters "rate" and "channels"
       also go in "a=rtpmap" as clock rate and encoding parameters,
       respectively.

    o  The general (and optional) parameter "ptime" goes in the SDP
       "a=ptime" attribute.

    o  Any payload-format-specific parameters go in the SDP "a=fmtp"
       attribute.  The format and syntax of these parameters may be
       defined by the payload format specification, but it is suggested
       that the parameters be copied directly from the MIME media type
       string as a semicolon separated list of parameter=value pairs.
       For payload formats that specify some other syntax for the fmtp

Internet Draft       draft-ietf-avt-rtp-mime-04.txt           March 2001


       parameters, the registration of that payload format as a MIME
       type must specify what the parameters are in MIME format and how
       to map them.  See Section 4.1.18 for an example.

An example mapping is as follows:

        audio/L16; rate=48000; channels=2; ptime=5; emphasis=50/15

        m=audio 49170 RTP/AVP 97
        a=rtpmap:97 L16/48000/2
        a=fmtp:97 emphasis=50/15
        a=ptime:5

Note that the payload format (encoding) names defined in the RTP Profile
are commonly shown in upper case.  MIME subtypes are commonly shown in
lower case.  These names are case-insensitive in both places.  Simi-
larly, parameter names are case-insensitive both in MIME types and in
the default mapping to the SDP a=fmtp attribute.

4.  Registrations for "Audio/Video Profile"

In the following sections, all RTP payload formats described in draft-
ietf-profile-new-04.txt are registered as MIME subtypes.

The following fields of the registration template in RFC 2048 have
generic values for all of these registrations unless explicitly overrid-
den in a specific registration.  To reduce the length of this document
these fields will not be replicated unless subtype-specific information
must be given:

     Encoding considerations:
          This type is only defined for transfer via RTP [RFC XXXX,
          draft-ietf-avt-rtp-new].

     Security considerations: none

     Interoperability considerations: none

     Required parameters: rate

     Optional parameters: channels, ptime

     Published specification: RFCYYYY

4.1.12.  Registration of MIME media type audio/L16

MIME subtype audio/L16 has already been registered via RFC 2586 for
transports other than RTP.  That registration is incorporated here and
augmented with additional information for RTP transport.

     MIME media type name: audio

     MIME subtype name: L16

     Required parameters
          rate: number of samples per second -- For non-RTP transport,
          the permissible values for rate are 8000, 11025, 16000, 22050,
          24000, 32000, 44100, and 48000 samples per second.  For RTP
          transport, other values are permissible but the aforementioned
          values are RECOMMENDED.  For RTP, the rate parameter indicates
          the RTP timestamp clock rate, which is equal to the sample
          rate.

     Optional parameters
          channels: how many audio streams are interleaved -- defaults
          to 1; stereo would be 2, etc.  Interleaving takes place
          between individual two-byte samples.

          emphasis: analog preemphasis applied to the data before quan-
          tization.  The only emphasis value defined here is empha-
          sis=50/15 to indicate the 50/15 microsecond preemphasis used
          with Compact Disks.  This parameter MUST be omitted if no ana-
          log preemphasis was applied.

          For RTP, ptime: RECOMMENDED duration of each packet in mil-
          liseconds.

     Encoding considerations
          Audio data is binary data, and must be encoded for non-binary
          transport; the Base64 encoding is suitable for Email.  Note
          that audio data does not compress easily using lossless com-
          pression.

          This type is also defined for transfer via RTP [RFC XXXX,
          draft-ietf-avt-rtp-new].

     Security considerations
          Audio data is believed to offer no security risks.

     Interoperability considerations
          This type is compatible with the encoding used in the WAV
          (Microsoft Windows RIFF) and Apple AIFF union types, and with
          the public domain "sox" and "rateconv" programs.

          It is expected that many audio and speech applications will
          use this type.  Already the most popular platforms provide
          this type with the rate=11025 parameter referred to as "radio

          are 1, 2, 3.

          samplerate: the rate at which audio is sampled.  MPEG-1 audio
          supports sampling rates of 32, 44.1, and 48 kHz; MPEG-2 sup-
          ports sampling rates of 16, 22.05 and 24 kHz.  This parameter
          is separate from the RTP timestamp clockrate which is always
          90000 Hz for MPA.

          mode: permissible values are "stereo", "joint_stereo", "sin-
          gle_channel", "dual_channel".  The "channels" parameter does
          not apply to MPA.  It is undefined to put a number of channels
          in the SDP rtpmap attribute for MPA.

          bitrate: the data rate for the audio bit stream.

          ptime: RECOMMENDED duration of each packet in milliseconds.

          Parameters which are omitted are left to the encoder to choose
          based on the session bandwidth, configuration information, or
          other constraints.  The selected layer as well as the sampling

For all of the video payload formats registered here, the RTP timestamp
clock rate is always 90000 Hz, so the "rate" parameter is not applica-
ble.  Likewise, the "channel" parameter is not used with video, and
while "ptime" could be used with video, it typically is not.

4.2.1.  Registration of MIME media type video/BT656

     MIME media type name: video

     MIME subtype name: BT656

     Required parameters: None

     Optional parameters: None

     MIME subtype name: H263-1998

     Required parameters: None

     Optional parameters: None

     Published specification: RFC 2429

4.2.7.  Registration of MIME media type video/H263-2000

     MIME media type name: video

     MIME subtype name: H263-2000

     Required parameters: None

     Optional parameters:
          profile: H.263 profile number, in the range 0 through 10,
          specifying the supported H.263 annexes/subparts.

          level: Level of bitstream operation, in the range 0 through
          100, specifying the level of computational complexity of the
          decoding process.

     Published specification: RFC 2429
          The specific values for the profile and level parameters and
          their meaning are defined in Annex X of ITU-T Recommendation
          H.263, "Video coding for low bit rate communication".  Note
          that the RTP payload format for H263-2000 is the same as for
          H263-1998, but additional annexes/subparts are specified along
          with the profiles and levels.

5.  Security Considerations

The registration procedure specified in this memo does not impose any
security considerations on its own.  This memo also contains several
MIME type registrations, each of which may state any security considera-
tions specific to that registration.

Several audio and video encodings are perfect for hiding data using
steganography.
