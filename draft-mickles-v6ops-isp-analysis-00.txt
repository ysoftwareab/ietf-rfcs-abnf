Abstract  
   This document provides analysis of how to transition the different
   types of Internet Service Provider (ISP) networks to IPv6.  It    
   will provide design recommendations which may be followed to      
   successfully deploy IPv6 services on a network that began as an   
   IPv4 network. This is the companion document to 
   draft-mickles-v6ops-isp-scenarios-04.txt which provides detailed 
   background information on all scenarios.

                Transition  Analysis for ISP Networks      Feb. 2003 
                                                                     
1. Introduction  
                                                                     
   This document will provide analysis and recommendations for
   ISPs to use in transitioning their existing IPv4 networks to
   IPv6.  It will show how existing mechanisms can be used to enable
   IPv6 capabilities over IP networking components and highlight any
   known challenges that may arise during a network transition. 

                                                                     
2. Scope of the document 
                                                                     
   The scope of this document is to cover the major topics ISPs must 
   consider in transitioning their IP networks to IPv6.  It is not
   meant to address every detail provided in the scenario document,
   but will highlight those details which are most important to the
   transition.

3.1 IPv6 Routing Considerations

   In this section we will discuss considerations for the IPv6 in the
   internal network as well as the external networking issues.

   Since IPv4 exists in the Core IGP, IPv6 capabilities must be added

                Transition  Analysis for ISP Networks      Feb. 2003 
                                                                     
   while maintaining IPv4 reachability.  In essence two IGP protocols
   will exist in one routing domain.  This mode is generally referred
   to as dual-stack mode or "ships in the night" mode.  This is not  
   an entirely new function of routers since running multiple routing
   protocols on routers has been a fairly common practice.  The      
   limitations for this practice include CPU power and memory.
                                                                     
   To add IPv6 capability to the core network, IPv6 routes must be   
   present in the IGP.  The choices of IGP for IPv6 networking       
   include ISIS and RIPv2.  Ripv2 is the simplest solution.  ISIS has
   the advantage of being able to carry both IPv4 and IPv6 routes in 
   one IGP.  OSPFv3 is a potential solution but is not currently     
   available and similar to RIPv2 in that it is not backward         
   compatible with OSPFv1 which supports IPv4 routes.  
                                                                     
   For networks which use OSPF as its IGP for IPv4 routes, the       
   recommendation is to continue carrying IPv4 routes in OSPFv1 and  
   configure IPv6 routes in ISIS.
                                                                     
   For networks which use ISIS, the recommendation is to add IPv6    
   routes to the existing IGP and run IPv4 and IPv6 integrated within
   ISIS.
                                                                     
   As the IPv6 network grows, there will exist routers which are only
   reachable via IPv6.
                                                                     
3.2 IPv6 Peering Considerations

   Generally peering is done on border routers. The two choices for  
   IPv6 peering include deploying a separate border router for       
   external IPv6 peering or converting existing IPv4 peering routers 
   to support IPv6 and IPv4 peering.
                                                                     
   In both cases the border routers will exchange IPv6 reachability  
   information using its IGP.
                                                                     
   To exchange IPv6 traffic over an EGP boundary, the routing        
   protocol of choice remains BGP.  The EGP boundary can be          
   established using either physical circuits or tunneled circuits   
   which are discussed below.  The routing table for IPv6 routes is  
   separate from the table for Ipv4 routes. 
                                                                     
3.3 IPv6 Transition Mechanisms
   Once basic decisions about deploying IPv6 services have been      
   determined how to establish connectivity between IPv6 nodes is the
   next step.  Since the transition assumes an IPv4 network exists,  
   there will be transitional nodes which operate in dual stack mode.
                                                                     
   There are two choices that may be used to inteconnect IPv6        
   capable nodes.  The first is to use physical links between nodes.

   This has been standard procedure in networking.  Point-to-point or
   LAN media may be used to establish connectivity and IPv6          
   addressing is configured over the link.  The second choice is to  
   use "IPv4 over IPv4" tunneling mechanisms to route IPv6 traffic   
   over IPv4 networks.
                                                                     
3.4 Network Management
                                                                     
   Since NM systems are used to monitor and configure networks, the  
   ability for NM systems to manage IPv6 capable routers must be     
   maintained.  While NM systems will reach dual stack routers over  
   the IPv4 path, there will be routers which are only reacheable via
   IPv6 and therefore NM systems must have an IPv6 presence to manage 
   those devices
                                                                     
3.5 Security Considerations
                                                                     
   Route filtering techniques should continue to be done for IPv6.  
                                                                     
   IPv6 networks are open to hacking attempts just as IPv4 networks,
   but the number of potential devices on a network make random port
   scaning less effective.

   HFC cable networks that support cable modem services to the home.

   the backbone ISP networks for transit IP services beyond their    
   region.

6.  Narrowband Dialup Networks 

   Transitioning the dial up ISP to IPv6 is somewhat straight forward
   since the major network devices in this model reside on a single  
   LAN.

6.1 IPv6 Routing Considerations
                                                                     
   To establish IPv6 connectivity in the dial up environment, the    
   devices between the end user host and NSP Network router must be  
   IPv6 capable.  The ISP edge router must be a dual-stack router.   
   The ISP edge router should have an IPv6 default route for global  
   IPv6 reachability.  This can be accomplished via the existing     
   physical circuit to the NSP router if the NSP supports IPv6 or to 
   a separate NSP' which supports IPv6.  An additional alternative is
   for the ISP router to tunnel IPv6 traffic over IPv4 to an IPv6    
   router with global IPv6 reachability.

6.2 IPv6 Transition Mechanisms
   In the dial up ISP environment the devices between the ISP router 
   and host appear to reside on the same LAN. Therefore the devices  
   on the LAN must support IPv6.
                                                                     
6.3 Network Management
                                                                     
   Since NM systems are used to monitor and configure networks, the  
   ability for NM systems to manage IPv6 capable devices must be     
   maintained.  While NM systems will reach dual stack devices over  
   the IPv4 path, there will be devices which are only reacheable via
   IPv6 and therefore NM systems must have an IPv6 presence to manage
   those devices.
                                                                     
6.4 Security Considerations
                                                                     
   Route filtering techniques should continue to be done for IPv6.  
                                                                     
   IPv6 networks are open to hacking attempts just as IPv4 networks, 
   but the number of potential devices on a network make random port 
   scaning less effective.
