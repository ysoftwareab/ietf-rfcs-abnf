Internet-Draft      Diameter MIP6 Feature Vector Bits          June 2009


1.  Introduction

   During the Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775] Split Scenario bootstrapping
   [RFC5026] the Mobile IPv6 Home Agent (HA) and the Authentication,
   Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) server MAY exchange a set of
   capabilities as defined in [I-D.ietf-dime-mip6-split].  This document
   defines additional capability flag bits that are used to authorize
   per Mobile Node (MN) route optimization, Multiple Care-of Address
   (MCoA) [I-D.ietf-monami6-multiplecoa] and user plane traffic
   encryption support.  Furthermore, this document also defines a
   capability flag bit of indicating whether the HA is authorized to act
   as a stand alone IPsec Virtual Private Network (VPN) gateway for
   remote VPN clients.  These new capability flag bits allow Mobility
   Service Provider (MSP) to control the supported services on the HA.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Flag definitions for the MIP6-Feature-Vector AVP

   The MIP6-Feature-Vector AVP is defined in [RFC5447].  The new
   capability bits defined in this document are intended to be used
   between the HA and the AAA server during the Mobile IPv6 Split
   Scenario bootstrapping Diameter interactions
   [I-D.ietf-dime-mip6-split].  However, the defined flag bits MAY also
   be used in other scenarios and deployments outside the Mobile IPv6
   Split Scenario.

3.1.  Route Optimization Support

   Route optimization support is indicated by using the RO_SUPPORTED
   (value 0x0000000200000000) capability flag bit.  When the HA sets
   this bit, it indicates support for the route optimization.  If this
   bit is unset in the returned MIP6-Feature-Vector AVP, the AAA server
   does not authorize route optimization for the MN.

3.2.  Multiple Care-of Addresses Support

   Multiple Care-of Addresses (MCoA) [I-D.ietf-monami6-multiplecoa]
   support is indicated by using the MCOA_SUPPORTED (value
   0x0000001000000000) capability flag bit.  When the HA sets this bit,
   it indicates support for the MCoA.  If this bit is unset in the
   returned MIP6-Feature-Vector AVP, the AAA server does not authorize

   the use of MCoA for the MN.

3.3.  User Traffic Encryption Support

   User plane traffic encryption support is indicated by using the
   USER_TRAFFIC_ENCRYPTION (value 0x0000000400000000) capability flag
   bit.  When the HA sets this bit, it indicates support for the user
   plane traffic encryption between the MN and the HA.  If this bit is
   unset in the returned MIP6-Feature-Vector AVP, the AAA server does
   not authorize user plane traffic encryption because of subscription
   or operator policy.

3.4.  VPN Gateway Mode Support

   The HA MAY act as a IPsec VPN gateway for the user and the support is
   indicated by the VPN_GW_MODE (value 0x0000000800000000) capability
   flag bit.  When the HA sets this bit, it indicates support for acting
   as a standalone IPsec VPN gateway.  If this bit is unset in the
   returned MIP6-Feature-Vector AVP, the AAA server does not authorize
   the HA to act as a standalone IPsec VPN gateway for the MN because of
   subscription or operator policy.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines new values to the "Mobility Capability"
   registry (see [RFC5447]) for use with the MIP6-Feature-Vector AVP:

   Token                            | Value                | Description
   ---------------------------------+----------------------+------------
   RO_SUPPORTED                     | 0x0000000200000000   | RFC TBD
   USER_TRAFFIC_ENCRYPTION          | 0x0000000400000000   | RFC TBD
   VPN_GW_MODE                      | 0x0000000800000000   | RFC TBD
   MCOA_SUPPORTED                   | 0x0000001000000000   | RFC TBD


5.  Security Considerations

   This document has no additional security consideration to those
   already described for the Mobile IPv6 Integrated Scenario Diameter
   interactions [RFC5447] and Mobile IPv6 Split Scenario Diameter
   interactions [I-D.ietf-dime-mip6-split].
