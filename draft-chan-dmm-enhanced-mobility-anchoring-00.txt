Abstract

   This document initiates the discussion on enhanced mobility anchoring
   solutions in the context of a distributed mobility management
   deployment.  Such solutions consider the problem of assigning a
   mobility anchor and a gateway at the initiation of a session.  In
   addition, the mid-session switching of the mobility anchor in a
   distributed mobility management environment is considered.

Internet-Draft          mobility anchor switching              July 2014


1.  Introduction

   A key requirement in distributed mobility management
   [I-D.ietf-dmm-requirements] is to enable traffic to avoid traversing
   single mobility anchor far from the optimal route.  Recent
   developments in research and standardization with respect to future
   deployment models call for far more flexibility in network function
   operation and management.  For example, the work on service function
   chaining at the IETF (SFC WG) has already identified a number of use
   cases for data centers.  Although the work in SFC is not primarily
   concerned with mobile networks, the impact on IP-based mobile
   networks is not hard to see as by now most hosts connected to the
   Internet do so over a wireless medium.  For instance, as a result of
   a dynamic re-organization of service chain a non-optimal route
   between mobile nodes may arise if pme relies solely on centralized
   mobility management.  As discussed earlier in the distributed
   mobility management working group (DMM WG) this may also occur when
   the mobile node has moved such that both the mobile node and the
   correspondent node are far from the mobility anchor via which the
   traffic is routed.

   Motivated by the above-mentioned developments as well as
   [I-D.ietf-dmm-requirements] we aim with this draft to initiate the
   discussion on enhanced mobility anchoring.  Recall that distributed
   mobility management solutions do not make use of centrally deployed
   mobility anchor.  As such, an application session SHOULD be able to
   have its traffic passing from one mobility anchor to another as the
   mobile node moves, or when changing operation and management (OAM)
   requirements call for mobility anchor switching, thus avoiding non-
   optimal routes.


2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL","SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   All general mobility-related terms and their acronyms used in this
   document are to be interpreted as defined in the Mobile IPv6 base
   specification [RFC6275] and in the Proxy Mobile IPv6 specification
   [RFC5213].  This includes terms such as mobile node (MN),
   correspondent node (CN), home agent (HA), home address (HoA), care-
   of-address (CoA), local mobility anchor (LMA), and mobile access
   gateway (MAG).

   In addition, this document uses the following term:

   Home network of an application session (or of an HoA)  is the network
      that has allocated the IP address (HoA) used for the session
      identifier by the application running in an MN.  An MN may be
      running multiple application sessions, and each of these sessions
      can have a different home network.


3.  Enhanced anchor switching

   In this section we consider mid-session mobility anchor switching for
   two cases.  First we discuss the case where the mobile node moves
   from one subnet to another, and then we discuss the case where the
   node moves to a different network.  Note that although the cases are
   described with traditional (read: physical) node mobility in mind,
   the proposed mechanism can be triggered for other operational
   reasons, such as the redefinition of a service chain graph, due to
   mechanisms which indicate that by relocating the mobility anchor for
   certain sessions energy and other operation expenditure can be
   reduced, or due to emergency situations, such as physical
   catastrophes.

3.1.  Anchor switching between subnets

   First we consider the situation illustrated in Fig. 1: The mobile
   node (M) moves from Subnet 1 to Subnet 2.  Each of the Network A
   Subnets (1, 2, and so on) owns a block of IP addresses.  In each
   subnet, the corresponding access router (AR1, AR2, ...) advertises
   the routes for the block of addresses of that subnet.

   Figure 1.  Movement of M from Subnet 1 to Subnet 2.

   Before moving, M is allocated an IP address IP1 from Subnet 1, and it
   may run network applications using this IP address.

   As M moves to Subnet 2, it obtains a new IP address IP2 from Subnet
   2.  The applications that can handle a change of IP address will use
   the address IP2 [I-D.seite-dmm-dma].  Other ongoing applications that
   cannot survive an IP address change will need to continue using IP11
   to maintain session continuity.  A mobility management protocol may
   be used to enable M to use the address IP1 belonging to Subnet 1.

   The AR1 access router in Subnet 1 may delegate the IP address (IP1)
   to the access router AR2 in Subnet 2.  AR2 will then advertise IP1 so
   that the routing tables in Network A will be updated and packets
   destined to IP1 will be routed to Subnet 2.

   Relying on earlier routing table update mechanisms with a distributed
   routing protocol may not be fast enough to meet the requirement for a
   short handover delay.  In the case where a control and data plane
   separation model is followed, a logically centralized mechanism can
   perform the forwarding table update faster.  For example, we can
   consider the use of I2RS mechanisms or the possibility to employ
   NETCONF [RFC6241] for reconfiguring AR2.

   Alternatively, a tunneling mobility management protocol such as MIPv6
   [RFC6275] or PMIPv6 [RFC5213] may be used initially [Paper-
   Distributed.Mobility.PMIP] to enable M to use the IP address IP1
   while IP1 still belongs to Subnet 1.  The route may not be optimized
   initially, but this is a good tradeoff so that anchor switching can

   take place.  After anchor switching and its subsequent forwarding
   table update have been completed, packets destined to IP1 will be
   routed directly towards M.

   The address delegation of IP1 from Subnet 1 to Subnet 2 may timeout
   unless there is request to renew it before it expires.  When all
   applications using IP1 in M have been terminated, there will be no
   longer need for using IP1 in Subnet 2.  If there are still such
   applications running when the address delegation is about to timeout,
   the mobile node may signal with AR1 to request renewal of address
   delegation.

3.2.  Anchor switching between networks

   Fig. 2 illustrates the movement of a mobile node (M) from Subnet a1
   of Network A to Subnet b2 of Network B. In this case, each Network
   (A, B, and so on) owns the aggregate of IP addresses blocks for its
   subnets.  The corresponding gateway routers (GWa, GWb, ...) may run
   an IBGP among them, and each advertises the aggregate of IP addresses
   for its subnets.

     +-----+         +-----+


   Figure 1.  Movement of M from Subnet a1 of Network A to Subnet b2 of
   Network B.

   Before moving, M is allocated the IP address IPa11 from Subnet a1 of
   Network A, and it may run network applications using this IP address.

Internet-Draft          mobility anchor switching              July 2014


   As M moves to Subnet b2, it obtains a new IP address IPb21 from
   Subnet b2 of Network B. The applications that can handle a change of
   IP address will use this new address IPb21.  Other applications with
   ongoing sessions that cannot survive an IP address change will need
   to continue using IPa11 to maintain session continuity.  A mobility
   management protocol may be used to enable M to use the address IPa11
   belonging to Subnet a1 in Network A.

   As the access router ARa1 in Subnet a1 may delegate the address IPa11
   to the access router ARb2 in Subnet b2, the gateways GWa, GWb, ...
   also need to update the routing information so that GWb will then
   advertise IPa11 so that the routing tables in GWa, GWb, ... will
   update and packets destined to IPa11 will be routed to Network B.

   The routing table update between the gateways MAY be accomplished
   using IS-IS.  In scenarios where the control plane and the data plane
   for these gateways are separate, and there is a controller for these
   gateways, a centralized routing protocol can also perform the
   forwarding table update for these gateways.

   Optionally, a tunneling mobility management protocol such as MIPv6
   [RFC6275] or PMIPv6 [RFC5213] may be used to initially enable M to
   use the address IPa11 while IPa11 still belongs to Subnet a1 of
   Network A. Although such a route may not be optimized initially, it
   enables anchor switching to take place.  After anchor switching and
   its subsequent forwarding table update have been completed, the
   packets destined to IPa11 will be routed directly towards M.

   The address delegation of IPa11 from Subnet a1 to Subnet b2 may
   timeout unless there is request to renew it before it expires.  When
   the applications uisng IPa11 in M have all been terminated, there
   will be no longer need for using IPa11 in Subnet b2.  If there are
   still such applications running when the address delegation is about
   to timeout, the mobile node may signal with ARa1 to request renewal
   of address delegation.
