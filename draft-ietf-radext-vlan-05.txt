INTERNET-DRAFT        VLAN and Priority Attributes            1 May 2006


1.  Introduction

   This document describes Virtual LAN (VLAN) and re-prioritization
   attributes that may prove useful for provisioning of access to IEEE
   802 local area networks [IEEE-802] with the Remote Authentication
   Dialin User Service (RADIUS).

   While [RFC3580] enables support for VLAN assignment based on the
   tunnel attributes defined in [RFC2868], it does not provide support
   for a more complete set of VLAN functionality as defined by
   [IEEE-802.1Q].  The attributes defined in this document provide
   support within RADIUS analogous to the management variables supported
   in [IEEE-802.1Q] and MIB objects defined in [RFC4363].  In addition,
   this document enables support for a wider range of [IEEE-802.1X]
   configurations.

1.1.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terms:

Network Access Server (NAS)
     A device that provides an access service for a user to a network.

1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.3.  Attribute Interpretation

   The attributes described in this document apply to a single instance
   of a NAS port, or more specifically an IEEE 802.1Q bridge port.
   [IEEE-802.1Q] [IEEE-802.1D] and [IEEE-802.1X] do not recognize finer
   management granularity than "per port".  In some cases, such as with
   IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs, the concept of a "virtual port" is used in
   place of the physical port.  Such virtual ports are typically based
   on security associations and scoped by station, or MAC address.

   The attributes defined in this document are applied on per user basis
   and it is expected that there is a single user per port; however in
   some cases that port may be a "virtual port".  If a NAS
   implementation conforming to this document supports "virtual ports",
   it may be possible to provision those "virtual ports" with unique
   values of the attributes described in this document, allowing
   multiple users sharing the same physical port to each have a unique
   set of authorization parameters.

INTERNET-DRAFT        VLAN and Priority Attributes            1 May 2006


   If a NAS conforming to this specification receives an Access-Accept
   packet containing an attribute defined in this document which it
   cannot apply, it MUST act as though it had received an Access-Reject.
   [RFC3576] requires that a NAS receiving a  Change of Authorization
   Request (CoA-Request) reply with a CoA-NAK if the Request contains an
   unsupported attribute.  It is recommended that an Error-Cause
   attribute with value set to "Unsupported Attribute" (401) be included
   in the CoA-NAK.  As noted in [RFC3576], authorization changes are
   atomic so that this situation does not result in session termination
   and the pre-existing configuration remains unchanged.  As a result,
   no accounting packets should be generated.

2.  Attributes

2.1.  Egress-VLANID

   Description

      The Egress-VLANID attribute represents an allowed IEEE 802 Egress
      VLANID for this port, indicating if the VLANID is allowed for
      tagged or untagged frames as well as the VLANID.

      As defined in [RFC3580], the VLAN assigned via tunnel attributes
      applies both to the ingress VLANID for untagged packets (known as
      the PVID) and the egress VLANID for untagged packets.  In
      contrast, the Egress-VLANID attribute configures only the egress
      VLANID for either tagged or untagged packets.  The Egress-VLANID
      attribute MAY be included in the same RADIUS packet as [RFC3580]
      tunnel attributes; however, the Egress-VLANID attribute is not
      necessary if it is being used to configure the same untagged
      VLANID included in tunnel attributes.  To configure an untagged
      VLAN for both ingress and egress, the tunnel attrubutes of
      [RFC3580] MUST be used.

      Multiple Egress-VLANID attributes MAY be included in Access-
      Request, Access-Accept, CoA-Request or Accounting-Request packets;
      this attribute MUST NOT be sent within an Access-Challenge,
      Access-Reject, Disconnect-Request, Disconnect-ACK, Disconnect-NAK,
      CoA-ACK or CoA-NAK.  Each attribute adds the specified VLAN to the
      list of allowed egress VLANs for the port.

      The Egress-VLANID attribute is shown below.  The fields are
      transmitted from left to right:

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      The Tag Indication field is one octet in length, and indicates
      whether the frames on the VLAN are tagged (0x31) or untagged
      (0x32).  The Pad field is 12-bits in length and MUST be 0 (zero).
      The VLANID is 12-bits in length and contains the [IEEE-802.1Q]
      VLAN VID value.

2.2.  Ingress-Filters

   Description

      The Ingress-Filters attribute corresponds to the Ingress Filter
      per-port variable defined in [IEEE-802.1Q] clause 8.4.5.  When the
      attribute has the value "Enabled", the set of VLANs that are
      allowed to ingress a port must match the set of VLANs that are
      allowed to egress a port.  Only a single Ingress-Filters attribute
      MAY be sent within an Access-Request, Access-Accept, CoA-Request
      or Accounting-Request packet; this attribute MUST NOT be sent
      within an Access-Challenge, Access-Reject, Disconnect-Request,
      Disconnect-ACK, Disconnect-NAK, CoA-ACK or CoA-NAK.

      The Ingress-Filters attribute is shown below.  The fields are
      transmitted from left to right:

   Value

      The Value field is four octets.  Supported values include:

      1 - Enabled
      2 - Disabled

2.3.  Egress-VLAN-Name

   Description

      Clause 12.10.2.1.3 (a) in [IEEE-8021.Q] describes the
      administratively assigned VLAN Name associated with a VLAN-ID
      defined within an IEEE 802.1Q bridge. The Egress-VLAN-Name
      attribute represents an allowed VLAN for this port.  It is similar
      to the Egress-VLANID attribute, except that the VLAN-ID itself is
      not specified or known; rather the VLAN name is used to identify
      the VLAN within the system.

      The tunnel attributes described in [RFC3580] and the Egress-VLAN-
      Name attribute both can be used to configure the egress VLAN for
      untagged packets.  These attributes can be used concurrently and
      MAY appear in the same RADIUS packet.  When they do appear
      concurrently, the list of allowed VLANs is the concatenation of
      the Egress-VLAN-Name and the Tunnel-Private-Group-ID (81)
      attributes.  The Egress-VLAN-Name attribute does not alter the
      ingress VLAN for untagged traffic on a port (also known as the
      PVID).  The tunnel attributes from [RFC3580] should be relied upon
      instead to set the PVID.

      The Egress-VLAN-Name attribute contains two parts; the first part
      indicates if frames on the VLAN for this port are to be

      represented in tagged or untagged format, the second part is the
      VLAN name.

      Multiple Egress-VLAN-Name attributes MAY be included within an
      Access-Request, Access-Accept, CoA-Request or Accounting-Request
      packet; this attribute MUST NOT be sent within an Access-
      Challenge, Access-Reject, Disconnect-Request, Disconnect-ACK,
      Disconnect-NAK, CoA-ACK or CoA-NAK.  Each attribute adds the named
      VLAN to the list of allowed egress VLANs for the port.  The
      Egress-VLAN-Name attribute is shown below.  The fields are
      transmitted from left to right:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   Type

      TBD

   Length

      >=4

   Tag Indication

      The Tag Indication field is one octet in length, and indicates
      whether the frames on the VLAN are tagged (0x31, ASCII '1') or
      untagged (0x32, ASCII '2').  These values were chosen so as to
      make them easier for users to enter.

   String

      The String field is at least one octet in length, and contains the
      the VLAN Name as defined in [IEEE-802.1Q] clause 12.10.2.1.3 (a).
      [RFC3629] UTF-8 encoded 10646 characters are RECOMMENDED, but a
      robust implementation SHOULD support the field as undistinguished
      octets.

2.4.  User-Priority-Table

   Description

      [IEEE-802.1D] clause 7.5.1 discusses how to regenerate (or re-map)
      user priority on frames received at a port.  This per-port



Congdon, et al.             Proposed Standard                   [Page 7]

INTERNET-DRAFT        VLAN and Priority Attributes            1 May 2006


      configuration enables a bridge to cause the priority of received
      traffic at a port to be mapped to a particular priority.
      [IEEE-802.1D] clause 6.3.9 describes the use of remapping:

         The ability to signal user priority in IEEE 802 LANs allows
         user priority to be carried with end-to-end significance across
         a Bridged Local Area Network.  This, coupled with a consistent
         approach to the mapping of user priority to traffic classes and
         of user priority to access_priority, allows consistent use of
         priority information, according to the capabilities of the
         Bridges and MACs in the transmission path...

         Under normal circumstances, user priority is not modified in
         transit through the relay function of a Bridge; however,
         network management can control how user priority is propagated.
         Table 7-1 provides the ability to map incoming user priority
         values on a per-Port basis.  By default, the regenerated user
         priority is identical to the incoming user priority.

      This attribute represents the IEEE 802 prioritization that will be
      applied to frames arriving at this port.  There are eight possible
      user priorities, according to the [IEEE-802] standard.
      [IEEE-802.1D] clause 14.6.2.3.3 specifies the regeneration table
      as 8 values, each an integer in the range 0-7.  The management
      variables are described in clause 14.6.2.2.

      A single User-Priority-Table attribute MAY be included in an
      Access-Accept or CoA-Request packet; this attribute MUST NOT be
      sent within an Access-Request, Access-Challenge, Access-Reject,
      Disconnect-Request, Disconnect-ACK, Disconnect-NAK, CoA-ACK, CoA-
      NAK or Accounting-Request.  Since the regeneration table is only
      maintained by a bridge conforming to [IEEE-802.1D], this attribute
      should only be sent to a RADIUS client supporting that
      specification.

      The User-Priority-Table attribute is shown below.  The fields are
      transmitted from left to right:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   Type

      TBD

   Length

      10

   String

      The String field is 8 octets in length, and includes a table which
      maps the incoming priority (if it is set - the default is 0) into
      one of eight regenerated priorities.  The first octet maps to
      incoming priority 0, the second octet to incoming priority 1, etc.
      The values in each octet represent the regenerated priority of the
      frame.

      It is thus possible to either remap incoming priorities to more
      appropriate values; to honor the incoming priorities; or to
      override any incoming priorities, forcing them to all map to a
      single chosen priority.

      The [IEEE-8021.D] specification, Annex G, provides a useful
      description of traffic type - traffic class mappings.

3.  Table of Attributes

   The following table provides a guide to which attributes may be found
   in which kinds of packets, and in what quantity.

   Access- Access- Access- Access-   CoA-  Acct-
   Request Accept  Reject  Challenge Req   Req   #   Attribute
    0+      0+      0       0        0+    0+   TBD  Egress-VLANID
    0-1     0-1     0       0        0-1   0-1  TBD  Ingress-Filters
    0+      0+      0       0        0+    0+   TBD  Egress-VLAN-Name
    0       0-1     0       0        0-1   0    TBD  User-Priority-Table

   The following table defines the meaning of the above table entries.

     0     This attribute MUST NOT be present in the packet.
     0+    Zero or more instances of this attribute MAY be
           present in the packet.
     0-1   Zero or one instance of this attribute MAY be
           present in the packet.

INTERNET-DRAFT        VLAN and Priority Attributes            1 May 2006


4.  Diameter Considerations

   Diameter needs to define identical attributes with the same Type
   values.  The attributes should be available as part of the NASREQ
   application [RFC4005], as well as the Diameter EAP application
   [RFC4072].

5.  IANA Considerations

   This specification does not create any new registries.

   This document uses the RADIUS [RFC2865] namespace, see
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/radius-types>.  Allocation of four
   updates for the section "RADIUS Attribute Types" is requested. The
   RADIUS attributes for which values are requested are:

   TBD - Egress-VLANID
   TBD - Ingress-Filters
   TBD - Egress-VLAN-Name
   TBD - User-Priority-Table

6.  Security Considerations

   This specification describes the use of RADIUS for purposes of
   authentication, authorization and accounting in IEEE 802 local area
   networks.  Threats and security issues for this application are
   described in [RFC3579] and [RFC3580]; security issues encountered in
   roaming are described in [RFC2607].

   This document specifies new attributes that can be included in
   existing RADIUS packets, which are protected as described in
   [RFC3579] and [RFC3576].  See those documents for a more detailed
   description.

   The security mechanisms described in [RFC3579] and [RFC3576] are
   focused on preventing an attacker from spoofing packets or modifying
   packets in transit.  They do not prevent an authorized RADIUS server
   or proxy from inserting attributes with malicious intent.

   VLAN attributes sent by a RADIUS server or proxy may enable access to
   unauthorized VLANs.  These vulnerabilities can be limited by
   performing authorization checks at the NAS.  For example, a NAS can
   be configured to accept only certain VLANIDs from a given RADIUS
   server/proxy.

   Similarly, an attacker gaining control of a RADIUS server or proxy
   can modify the user priority table, causing either degradation of
   quality of service (by downgrading user priority of frames arriving

   at a port), or denial of service (by raising the level of priority of
   traffic at multiple ports of a device, oversubscribing the switch or
   link capabilities).
