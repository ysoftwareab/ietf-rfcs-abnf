4.  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        RFC 1155 [RFC1155], RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC 1215 [RFC1215].
        The second version, called SMIv2, is described in RFC 2578
        [RFC2578], RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

    o   Message protocols for transferring management information. The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in RFC 1157 [RFC1157]. A second version of the SNMP
        message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
        protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [RFC1901]
        and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version of the message
        protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [RFC1906],
        RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].

    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in RFC 1157 [RFC1157]. A second set of protocol
        operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
        [RFC1905].

    o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573
        [RFC2573] and the view-based access control mechanism described
        in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable

Internet-Draft            APM Capabilities MIB                March 2000


   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

5.  Overview

There is a need for a standardized way of characterizing the measurement
capabilities of tools which provide application performance data.  There
are many different techniques for measuring and characterizing the
performance of specific network-based applications available at this
time. A standardized framework for describing the capabilities of a
particular technique is needed as a pre-requisite for a standardized APM
results reporting framework.

This memo addresses the specific requirements of the APM capabilities
framework. Other aspects of APM, such as configuration and results
reporting are not addressed in this memo.

5.1.  Terms

Some new terms are used throughout this document:

5.1.1.  APM Data

The actual measurements, kept in some internal representation, collected
from one or more APM Collection Points. This data is converted into one
or more APM Reports, in an implementation-specific manner. APM Data is
outside the scope of the APM standard.

5.1.2.  APM Device

A device which contains an SNMP agent which implements the APM MIB. For
the purpose of the standard, the APM device is the entity that is
reporting the APM results, in the form of standard MIB objects.  An APM
Device can obtain APM data from one or more APM Collection Points.

5.1.3.  APM Collection Point

The general location, within the spectrum of possible vantage points,
that APM Data is collected, for one or more APM Studies (and perhaps
more than one APM device).  The interaction between an APM device and an
APM Collection Point is outside the scope of the APM standard.

Internet-Draft            APM Capabilities MIB                March 2000


5.1.4.  APM Study Class

The unique set of mechanisms and parameters that classifies and
identifies a particular APM collection capability.  E.g.,

 - the set of protocols collected

 - test attributes (standard and proprietary)

 - collection technique(s)

 - APM Collection Point information

 - report capabilities

 - vendor-specific Study Class ID

5.1.5.  APM Study

This is an instantiation of a particular APM Study Class.  Some
parameters, such as:

 - the dataSource to monitor

 - any resource restrictions to enforce

 - the specific set of result data to collect

are relevant only in the context of an APM Study, not an APM Study
Class.

5.1.6.  APM Report Class

The type of APM report produced on behalf of a particular APM Study
Class. The group identified these distinct APM Report Classes:

 - distribution-based aggregation

 - statistica-based aggregation

 - exception-based reporting

Internet-Draft            APM Capabilities MIB                March 2000


5.1.7.  APM Report

The set of result data for a particular APM Study.  This is in the form
of standard MIB objects and notifications in the APM MIB.

5.1.8.  APM Location

The notion of where an APM Collection Point is obtaining APM Data. At
the highest level, the possible locations are:

  - client

  - network

  - server

5.1.9.  APM Class

At the highest level, there are three classes of APM technology.

 - passive collection
     No test traffic is introduced into the system being measured.  APM
     Data is derived from observable 'user activity' in the actual
     operating environment.

 - active collection
     Some form of test traffic is introduced into the system being
     measured.  APM Data is derived from measured attributes of this
     test traffic.

 - intrusive collection
     Actual network traffic is modified for the purpose of APM Data
     collection. APM Data is derived from measured attributes of this
     modified network traffic.

5.2.  Relationship to RMON-2 MIB

This MIB uses the protocolDirTable [RFC2021] to identify the protocols
which are relevant to a particular APM Study Class. Implementation of
the protocolDirectoryGroup is required.

5.3.  Relationship to IPPM

This MIB uses the Metric definitions found in IPPM documents ([RFC2330]
[RFC2678] [RFC2679] [RFC2680] [RFC2681]) to identify the base metrics

Internet-Draft            APM Capabilities MIB                March 2000


measured for a given APM Study Class.

5.4.  Relationship to Other MIBs

This MIB assumes that a standard Application Performance Measurement MIB
(APM MIB) will be produced, which will provide support for basic
configuration of an APM Study, as well as APM Report data.

This MIB also assumes that a standard Transport Performance Measurement
MIB (TPM MIB) will be produced, which will provide additional 'drill-
down' support for transport layer protocols and additional metrics not
directly supported by the APM MIB.

6.  APM Framework Components

An APM Study is executed and reported within the APM Framework.
Usually, some sort of network infrastructure is assumed, in which client
devices, application servers, forwarding devices, and one or more APM
monitoring devices are connected.  However, non-networking based
methodologies can also be used.

Some basic attributes of the APM Framework are listed below.

6.1.  Performance Criteria

A set of network, transport, and/or application performance criteria is
needed, based on some combination of network traffic attributes.  The
specification and evaluation of performance test results is beyond the
scope of this document.

6.2.  Performance Measurement Granularity

Each APM Study Class explicitly defines the granularity of the test, in
terms of the purpose, selected metrics, and other attributes.

6.3.  Network Traffic Selection Criteria

For APM techniques which monitor or generate network traffic, a set of
rules is needed which specifies which packets will be included in a
particular performance test. This includes device attributes such as
interface identity, and packet attributes such as VLAN ID, QoS value, IP
subnet or host addresses, application type(s), and application payload.

Internet-Draft            APM Capabilities MIB                March 2000


6.4.  Set of Metrics

For each APM Study Class, there are one or more metrics, appropriate for
the associated network traffic and performance selection criteria, which
are measured by the APM device(s) used for an individual APM Study.

6.5.  APM Study Class Capabilities

For each APM Study Class supported by an APM Device, there is a set of
capabilities associated with the selected set of metrics and performance
criteria. There is also a set of possible report output capabilities
associated with each class.

6.6.  APM Collection Point Location

The physical location of each APM Collection Point is an important
attribute of each APM Study Class.

   +------------+    +---------+             +----------+    +----------+
   |            |    | Last    |             | Last Hop |    |          |
   |  Client    |<-->| Hop for |<--> ... <-->| for Net  |<-->| Network  |
   |            |    | Client  |             | Service  |    | Service  |
   +------------+    +---------+             +----------+    +----------+

           <------------- Measurement Device Location ------------>

For the purposes of this MIB, an APM Collection Point resides in either
the 'client', the 'network', or the 'server'.

6.7.  APM Study Configuration

Each APM Study may require some combination of generic and test-specific
configuration commands in order to prepare the network environment for
measurement.  Specific APM Study configuration mechanisms are beyond the
scope of this document.

6.8.  APM Study Results Storage and Retrieval

Each APM Device must be able to store the APM Reports generated on
behalf of each APM Study, and convey these reports to a management
application. The specification of these mechanisms are beyond the scope
of this document.

11.  Security Considerations

There are no management objects defined in this MIB that have a MAX-
ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this MIB is
implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an intruder can alter
or create any management objects of this MIB via direct SNMP SET
operations.

SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and GET/SET
(read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

It is recommended that the implementers consider the security features
as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use of the User-
based Security Model RFC 2574 [RFC2574] and the View- based Access
Control Model RFC 2575 [RFC2575] is recommended.

It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity
giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly configured to give
access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have
legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
