                               Abstract 
This document specifies the QUALDOCS (QD) protocol. The QD requirements 
are derived from the requirements for Internet Fax [1]. 
In summary QD is used to provide a synchronous, reliable exchange of 
image documents between clients and servers. The primary use envisaged 
of this protocol is to provide a synchronous image transmission service 
for the Internet. Contrast this with the store and forward fax-like 
protocol specified in [2] and [3]. 
This document proposes that the QD protocol should use an extended 
version of IPP1.1 [4], [5].

1    Introduction. 
Note - It is assumed that the reader is familiar with IPP.  
QD is primarily intended as a method of supporting a secure, high 
quality document distribution protocol over the Internet. It therefore 
discusses paper, pages, scanning and printing, etc. There is however no 
requirement that the input documents come from actual paper nor is 
there a requirement that the output of the process be printed paper. 
The  only  conformance  requirements  are  those  associated  with  the 
exchange of data over the network. 

1.1   Namespace used 
The extension specified in this document uses the prefix 'QD-' for all 
new IPP elements created. 

1.2   Model 
This proposal defines a logical model of a QD interchange. The 
following terms are introduced: - 
'Sender'. This is the agent (software, hardware or some combination) 
that is used to transmit a document to a receiver. 
'Receiver'. This is the agent that receives the document sent by the 
sender. 
'Document'. A document is a set of one or more pages that the sender 
sends to the receiver.  
'Sending user'. The person interacting with the sender. 
'Receiving user'. The intended human recipient of the document being 
sent. 
'QD Job'. An IPP job submitted by a sender. 
'Combined Device'. This is a software / hardware combination that is 
both a sender and a receiver. This is expected to be a common 
configuration. There are specific requirements for this type of device 
. see 'Combined Devices'. 

1.3   Typical exchange 
The  sending  user  determines  the  address  of  the  receiver  .  see 
'Addressing'. This document does not specify how the sending user does 
this.  Possible  methods  include  directory  lookup,  search  engines, 
business cards, network enumeration protocols such as SLP, etc. 
 
Moore                   QUALDOCS working group                [Page 3] 
 






INTERNET-DRAFT            QUALDOCS protocol           17 December 1999 

The sending user loads the document into the sender, indicates the 
receiver's address and starts the exchange. 
The sender determines whether or not the receiver is a QD capable 
device . see 'QD detection' 
The following identities are determined and exchanged: sender, sending 
user, receiver and receiving user . see 'Identity exchange' 
The sender scans the documents and converts them into an acceptable 
data format . see 'data formats' 
This data is transmitted to the receiver . see 'Data Transmission'. 
The sending user receives a confirmation that the receiver received the 
document . see 'Confirmation' 
If the sender is unable to initiate or complete the exchange then it is 
assumed that it will perform some form of retry. The mechanisms used 
and the user-visible behavior in this case is an implementer's choice 
beyond the scope of this document. 

1.4   Gateways 
The QD protocol may be used as a gateway protocol to or from other 
image transmission systems. See 'Gateways to other systems' later. 

2    QD detection 
A sender needs to determine whether or not the destination URL it has 
represents:- 
  a) A valid IPP destination 
  b) A QD receiver (not all IPP destinations are QD receivers) 
This document does not specify how to perform the first validation. 
Refer to the IPP implementer's guide [6]. 
To perform the second validation a sender SHOULD execute an IPP 'get-
printer-attributes' operation to retrieve the 'QD-receiver' attribute.  
If the IPP printer supports this attribute then sender can be sure that 
it is a QD receiver. If not then the sender may choose to abandon the 
exchange or to enter degraded mode.  

2.1   Degraded Mode 
QD describes a variation of IPP . it is perfectly possible for a 
complete QD-like exchange to take place between a QD client and an IPP 
printer.  
From the viewpoint of QD this is a degraded mode of operation. The main 
features that will be missing are:- 
Guaranteed exchange: Since IPP does not mandate any data formats it is 
possible that the sender may not be able to discover a common data 
format that both it and the printer support. 
Identity  exchange:  IPP  does  not  provide  the  definitive  identity 
exchange that QD does. In many cases however this is acceptable

INTERNET-DRAFT            QUALDOCS protocol           17 December 1999 

3    Data formats 
In order to usefully exchange documents between arbitrary QD end points 
there must be some agreement on what formats are used to represent the 
data. This document therefore defines two things:- 
  . A mechanism for negotiating data formats  
  . A minimal set of document formats that all senders and receivers 
     need to implement 

3.1   Format negotiation 
The format negotiation is very simple. The sender SHOULD use the IPP 
'get-printer-attributes'  operation  to  read  the  'document-format-
supported' attribute of the receiver. The sender then either selects 
the most appropriate format or decides that it cannot interact with the 
receiver. Note that this document does not specify the sender behavior 
in the latter case.  
Additional format negotiation may take place depending on the gross 
format selected (see TIFF-FX below). The additional negotiation is 
performed by the sender reading one or more format specific IPP printer 
attributes. 
Note that a sender MAY use any means it chooses to determine what 
format to send. It may have a-priori knowledge of the receiver or 
determine that it can support other data formats using some other 
mechanism (for example it can read the receiver's manufacturer and 
model and therefore determine the formats supported). The sender SHOULD 
NOT send any data format that the receiver does not support. If it does 
so the receiver will reject it (IPP conformance). 
The sender MAY send any supported format to the receiver. It is the 
sender's choice; the receiver has no way of indicating preferred 
formats  
The sender MUST specify the data format being sent by including the 
(optional in IPP) job attribute 'document-format' 

3.2   TIFF-FX 
A receiver MUST support TIFF-FX format [8]. This means that the 
'document-format-supported'    printer    attribute    MUST    contain 
"application/tiff". The conformance requirements are those laid out in 
[8], this specifies what profiles are required and what profiles are 
optional. For example a B&W receiver MUST support profile S (MH) and 
may choose to support profile J (JBIG). 
To enable the sender to determine what 'flavor' of TIFF-FX to use the 
receiver MUST support the 'QD-TIFF-capabilities' attribute. 
[NOTE: There is some debate about what profiles, resolution, etc., of 
FX should be mandated. It seems to me that the right thing to do is to 
mandate conformance with 2301. If 2301 does not specify the right 
conformance levels then it should be changed (given that it was 
designed specifically for this application). 

 
Moore                   QUALDOCS working group                [Page 5] 
 






INTERNET-DRAFT            QUALDOCS protocol           17 December 1999 

I also think that we do not need to mandate a lot. Given that I have 
defined a flavor detection mechanism a sender can tell if a receiver 
support JBIG or not, supported resolutions, etc. The important point is 
that by mandating FX we all get into the same ball park- s smart client 
can do the rest] 

4    Identity exchange 

4.1   Sending user 
The sending user identity SHOULD be sent to the receiver. The identity 
is specified in a new IPP job attribute . 'QD-sending-user-identity'. 
This is in mime vcard [12] format. 

4.2   Receiving User 
The identity of the intended receiving user SHOULD be included in a 
request. The identity is specified in a new IPP job attribute, 'QD-
receiving-user-identity'. This is in mime vcard format[12]. 

4.3   Sender 
The sender MUST have an identity in the same way that a fax machine has 
a sending station ID. The sender's identity MUST be sent to the 
receiver using a new IPP job attribute, 'QD-sender-identity'.   
The value of this identity is not specified but SHOULD be a value that 
can reasonably be expected to uniquely identify the device. A value 
derived from the MAC address would be a reasonable starting point. 

4.4   Receiver 
The receiver MUST have an identity that the sender MAY read. The 
receiver MUST make this available via a new IPP printer attribute, 'QD-
receiver-identity'. 
The same rules apply as for the sender identity. 

5    Data Exchange 

5.1   Addressing 
The receiver's address MUST be an IPP1.1 URL using the 'ipp' scheme. 
Example: <ipp://www.acme.com/ipp/print5> 

5.2   Transmission 
Documents MUST be sent using the IPP print-job operation. There is no 
requirement for the receiver to support any other IPP job submission 
operations. 
The sender MAY include any valid job description or job template 
attributes.

INTERNET-DRAFT            QUALDOCS protocol           17 December 1999 

5.3   Confirmation 
The sender knows when the receiver has successfully received the entire 
document, the sender can then inform the sending user. 
The sender SHOULD use the successful end of the print-job operation as 
an indication that the receiver has received the document. 

5.4   Cover Pages 
A receiver MAY create a cover page to be placed at the beginning of the 
received  document.  This  mechanism  replaces  (and  uses  the  same 
attributes) the IPP job sheet system. 
The format of the cover page is not specified by this document but 
SHOULD include:- 
  . The sending users details . from 'QD-sending-user-identity' 
  . The receiving user details . from 'QD-receiving-user-identity' 
  . The sender's identity . from 'QD-sender-identity' 
  . The receiver's identity . from 'QD-receiver-identity' 
  . The local date and time 
  . The subject . from job-description  
  . The page count . from job-media-sheets if it was supplied 
In some cases a client may not want a cover page to be automatically 
generated (there might already be a cover page included in the 
document). It MAY therefore set the job-sheets job attribute to 'none' 
to indicate that it does not want a cover page. 

5.5   Identity Stamping 
The receiver SHOULD place the receiver identity on the first page of 
the received document. 

5.6   Combined Devices 
If a device implements both a sender and a receiver then there are 
certain things it is required to do. 
The  'QD-sender-identity'  MUST  be  the  same  as  the  'QD-receiver-
identity'. That means that they match byte for byte. 
The sender MUST include the address of its receiver component in every 
request. It does this with a new IPP job attribute, 'QD-return-
address'.  
A non-combined device MAY include a 'QD-return-address' in a request. 

6    IPP Implementation 
The receiver MUST implement a fully conformant IPP1.1 printer object. 
There is no requirement for the receiver to implement any of the 
optional features of IPP unless explicitly stated elsewhere in this 
document. 
 
Moore                   QUALDOCS working group                [Page 7] 
 






INTERNET-DRAFT            QUALDOCS protocol           17 December 1999 

QD restricts the use of IPP in certain cases. One aim is to make 
attaching a receiver to the Internet a safe option . see 'security 
considerations' 

6.1   Canceling jobs 
It is inappropriate for a sender to transmit a document, receive 
confirmation of its arrival and then cancel it. Therefore: - 
The sender SHOULD NOT attempt to cancel the print job once it has been 
sent to the receiver. 
The receiver MUST reject cancel job operations targeted at QD jobs. 
(The receiver can determine that this is a QD job by the presence of 
the mandatory 'QD-sender-identity' job attribute). The 'cancel-job' 
operation therefore becomes a privileged operation on all QD-jobs. This 
is a change to the IPP behavior. 

6.2   Querying jobs 
The public nature of QD interactions make it inappropriate for a sender 
to be able to query a receiver for information about jobs that it did 
not send. 
The MUST restrict the job attributes that any sender can request for 
any QD job in a 'get-jobs' or 'get-job-attributes' operation to: - 
  . job-id, job-URI 
  . job-k-octets, job-k-octets-completed 
  . job-media-sheets, job-media-sheets-completed, 
  . time-at-creation, time-at-processing 
  . job-state, job-state-reasons 
  . number-of-intervening-jobs 
 This attribute set allows a sender to determine the load on a receiver 
(and perhaps choose an alternative destination or warn the sending 
user).  
See the discussion in section 8.4 of [4] for a description of how a 
receiver must behave if it receives a request for an attribute outside 
this set. 
An IPP administrator may read all attributes. 

6.3   Job submission 
A receiver MUST NOT support any of the optional job submission 
operations. What this means is that the IPP printer object must not 
allow 'QD-sender-identity' on any operation other than 'print-job'. 
A receiver MUST reject an operation (other than 'print-job') that 
contains  a  'QD-sender-identity'  job  attribute.  It  does  this  by 
returning a '401 not authorized' error 


 
Moore                   QUALDOCS working group                [Page 8] 
 






INTERNET-DRAFT            QUALDOCS protocol           17 December 1999 

6.4   Other Operations 
All other IPP operations MUST be treated as administrative by the 
receiver even in the case where IPP would normally permit them. For 
example the hold-job operation cannot be used by a sender except in the 
case where the sending user is identified as an IPP administrator. 

7    Security considerations 
QD  presents  an  interesting  challenge  of  balancing  security  and 
openness. Many of the envisaged uses of QD require confidentiality of 
the data . at the same time the receiver typically has no prior 
knowledge of the sender or the sending user. This last point will 
normally rule out all user-based authentication and access control. 
This is the reason for the restriction placed on querying and canceling 
QD jobs. 

7.1   Privacy 
Any exchange between a sender and a receiver MAY be carried using the 
privacy mechanism specified in IPP1.1 namely TLS [9]. In some cases 
this will also result in mutual authentication of the sender and 
receiver (in the case where both sides have certificates). 

7.2   Spoof-proofing 
It is unlikely that large numbers of QD devices will have certificates 
that will allow for mutual trusted authentication. This presents the 
problem of how one can guarantee that the QD identities that are 
exchanged are valid. 
The best solution to this would be to use digital signatures . this is 
beyond the scope of this document. 

7.3   Access control 
It is expected that the majority of QD receivers will operate in a 
public mode. However a receiver MAY protect itself using any method 
specified in [4] (digest authentication [11] for example) to restrict 
access to any or all of its functionality. 

7.4   Reduced feature set 
An administrator or device implementer may choose to setup up a device 
so that it only works as a QD receiver (i.e., offers no 'native' IPP 
features). In this mode it offers a restricted set of features and may 
be more safely connected to the Internet.  
A receiver that is operating in this mode SHOULD do so by rejecting any 
non-QD request with a '401 not authorized' error code. 

8    Gateways to other systems 
A common scenario will be where QD acts as an on-ramp or off-ramp to 
other document transmission systems.

INTERNET-DRAFT            QUALDOCS protocol           17 December 1999 

8.1   On-Ramps 
'On-ramp' means that the user with a document to send uses a QD sender 
to transmit a document to a QD receiver that in turn transmits it to 
some other destination. 
In order that the intermediate gateway should know where to send the 
document the sender needs to tell the gateway where to send the 
document. The sender uses the 'QD-destination-URI' job description 
attribute for this purpose. Note that this is only useful in the on-
ramp case. 
The on-ramping receiver SHOULD indicate to the sender the addressing 
schemes it supports for 'QD-destination-URI'. It does this with the 
'QD-destination-schemes-supported' attribute. 

8.2   Off-ramps 
'Off-ramp' means that the user originally sends the document using some 
other mechanism. The intermediate agent then uses QD to transmit the 
document to its final destination. QD has no specific support for off-
ramps. 

9    Formal Attribute Definition 

9.1   QD-sending-user-identity 
Format: octetString(1023) 
Type: job description 
Description: This attribute is used by the sender to indicate the 
sending user's identity to the receiver. It is in vcard format. Note 
that a valid vcard identity block could exceed 1023 octets in length. 
The sender implementation must ensure that the actual value is 1023 or 
less I length. 
Conformance: A QD receiver MUST support this attribute. A sender SHOULD 
send this attribute

identity of the intended human recipient. Refer to the description of 
QD-sending-user-identity  for  a  discussion  of  the  length  of  this 
attribute. 
Conformance: A QD receiver MUST support this attribute. A sender SHOULD 
send this attribute 

9.3   QD-sender-identity 
Format: name 
Type: Job description 
Description: This attribute is used by the sender to identify itself. 
The presence of this job description attribute also marks the job as a 
QD job. 
Conformance: A receiver MUST support this attribute. A sender MUST send 
this attribute 

9.4   QD-receiver-identity 
Format: name 
Type: Printer description 
Description: This attribute uniquely identifies the receiver. 
Conformance: A receiver MUST implement this attribute. 

9.5   QD-destination-scheme-supported 
Format: 1setOf type2 keyword 
Type: Printer Description 
Description: This attribute is used by the receiver to indicate what 
formats it supports for the 'QD-destination-URI' attribute. The values 
in this list are URI scheme names without their trailing ':' . i.e. 
'ipp', 'mailto', . 
Conformance: A receiver SHOULD implement this attribute if it is acting 
as an on-ramp. 

9.6   QD-destination-URI 
Format: URI 
Type: Job description 
Description: A sender SHOULD include this attribute in a job in the 
case where it knows that the receiver is not the final destination. The 
scheme of this URI MUST be one of those specified by 'QD-destination-
scheme-supported'. 
Conformance: An on-ramping receiver MUST support this attribute.
