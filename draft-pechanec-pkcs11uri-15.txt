                      draft-pechanec-pkcs11uri-15

Abstract

   This memo specifies a PKCS#11 Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
   Scheme for identifying PKCS#11 objects stored in PKCS#11 tokens, for
   identifying PKCS#11 tokens themselves, or for identifying PKCS#11
   libraries.  The URI is based on how PKCS#11 objects, tokens, and
   libraries are identified in the PKCS#11 Cryptographic Token Interface
   Standard.

1.  Introduction

   The PKCS #11: Cryptographic Token Interface Standard [pkcs11_spec]
   specifies an API, called Cryptoki, for devices which hold
   cryptographic information and perform cryptographic functions.
   Cryptoki, pronounced crypto-key and short for cryptographic token
   interface, follows a simple object-based approach, addressing the
   goals of technology independence (any kind of device may be used) and
   resource sharing (multiple applications may access multiple devices),
   presenting applications with a common, logical view of the device - a
   cryptographic token.

   It is desirable for applications or libraries that work with PKCS#11
   tokens to accept a common identifier that consumers could use to
   identify an existing PKCS#11 storage object in a PKCS#11 token, an
   existing token itself, or an existing Cryptoki library (also called a
   producer, module, or provider).  The set of storage object types that
   can be stored in a PKCS#11 token includes a certificate, a public,
   private or secret key, and a data object.  These objects can be
   uniquely identifiable via the PKCS#11 URI scheme defined in this
   document.  The set of attributes describing a storage object can
   contain an object label, its type, and its ID.  The set of attributes
   that identifies a PKCS#11 token can contain a token label, a
   manufacturer name, a serial number, and a token model.  Attributes
   that can identify a Cryptoki library are a library manufacturer, a
   library description, and a library version.  Library attributes may

   be necessary to use if more than one Cryptoki library provides a
   token and/or PKCS#11 objects of the same name.  A set of query
   attributes is provided as well.

   The PKCS#11 URI cannot identify other objects defined in the
   specification [pkcs11_spec] aside from storage objects.  For example,
   objects not identifiable by a PKCS#11 URI include a hardware feature
   and mechanism.  Note that a Cryptoki library does not have to provide
   for storage objects at all.  The URI can still be used to identify a
   specific PKCS#11 token or an API producer in such a case.

   A subset of existing PKCS#11 structure members and object attributes
   was chosen believed to be sufficient in uniquely identifying a
   PKCS#11 token, storage object, or library in a configuration file, on
   a command line, or in a configuration property of something else.
   Should there be a need for a more complex information exchange on
   PKCS#11 entities a different means of data marshalling should be
   chosen accordingly.

   A PKCS#11 URI is not intended to be used to create new PKCS#11
   objects in tokens, or to create PKCS#11 tokens.  It is solely to be
   used to identify and work with existing storage objects and tokens
   through the PKCS#11 API, or identify Cryptoki libraries themselves.

   The URI scheme defined in this document is designed specifically with
   a mapping to the PKCS#11 API in mind.  The URI uses the scheme, path
   and query components defined in the Uniform Resource Identifier
   (URI): Generic Syntax [RFC3986] document.  The URI does not use the
   hierarchical element for a naming authority in the path since the
   authority part could not be mapped to PKCS#11 API elements.  The URI
   does not use the fragment component.

   If an application has no access to a producer or producers of the
   PKCS#11 API the query component module attributes can be used.
   However, the PKCS#11 URI consumer can always decide to provide its
   own adequate user interface to locate and load PKCS#11 API producers.

3.1.  PKCS#11 URI Scheme Name

   pkcs11

3.2.  PKCS#11 URI Scheme Status

   Permanent.

3.3.  PKCS#11 URI Scheme Syntax

   The PKCS#11 URI is a sequence of attribute value pairs separated by a
   semicolon that form a one level path component, optionally followed
   by a query.  In accordance with Section 2.5 of [RFC3986], the data
   should first be encoded as octets according to the UTF-8 character
   encoding [RFC3629]; then only those octets that do not correspond to
   characters in the unreserved set or to permitted characters from the
   reserved set should be percent-encoded.  This specification suggests
   one allowable exception to that rule for the "id" attribute, as
   stated later in this section.  Grammar rules "unreserved" and "pct-
   encoded" in the PKCS#11 URI specification below are imported from
   [RFC3986].  As a special case, note that according to Appendix A of
   [RFC3986], a space must be percent-encoded.

   PKCS#11 specification imposes various limitations on the value of
   attributes, be it a more restrictive character set for the "serial"
   attribute or fixed sized buffers for almost all the others, including
   "token", "manufacturer", and "model" attributes.  However, the
   PKCS#11 URI notation does not impose such limitations aside from
   removing generic and PKCS#11 URI delimiters from a permitted
   character set.  We believe that being too restrictive on the
   attribute values could limit the PKCS#11 URI usefulness.  What is
   more, possible future changes to the PKCS#11 specification should not
   affect existing attributes.

   The URI path component contains attributes that identify a resource
   in a one level hierarchy provided by Cryptoki producers.  The query
   component can contain a few attributes that may be needed to retrieve
   the resource identified by the URI path.  Both path and query
   components may contain vendor specific attributes.  Such attribute
   names must start with an "x-" prefix.  Attributes in the path
   component are delimited by ';' character, attributes in the query
   component use '&' as a delimiter.

   The general '/' delimiter was removed from available characters that
   do not have to be percent-encoded in the path component so that
   generic URI parsers never split the path component into multiple
   segments.  The '/' delimiter can be used unencoded in the query
   component.  Delimiter '?' was removed since the PKCS#11 URI uses a
   query component.  Delimiter '#' was removed so that generic URI
   parsers are not confused by unencoded hash characters.  All other
   generic delimiters are allowed to be used unencoded (':', '[', ']',
   and '@') in the PKCS#11 URI.

   The following table presents mapping between the PKCS#11 URI path
   component attributes and the PKCS#11 API structure members and object
   attributes.  Given that PKCS#11 URI users may be quite ignorant about
   the PKCS#11 specification the mapping is a product of a necessary
   compromise between how precisely are the URI attribute names mapped
   to the names in the specification and the ease of use and
   understanding of the URI scheme.

    Table 1: Mapping between URI path component attributes and PKCS#11
                            specification names

   The query component attribute "pin-source" specifies where the
   application or library should find the normal user's token PIN, the
   "pin-value" attribute provides the normal user's PIN value directly,
   if needed, and the "module-name" and "module-path" attributes modify
   default settings for accessing PKCS#11 providers.  For the definition
   of a "normal user", see [pkcs11_spec].

   The ABNF rules above is a best effort definition and this paragraph
   specifies additional constraints.  The PKCS#11 URI must not contain
   duplicate attributes of the same name in the URI path component.  It
   means that each attribute may be present at most once in the PKCS#11
   URI path.  Aside from the query attributes defined in this document,
   duplicate attributes may be present in the URI query component and it
   is up to the URI consumer to decide on how to deal with such
   duplicates.

   It is recommended to percent-encode the whole value of the "id"
   attribute which is supposed to be handled as arbitrary binary data.

   The "library-version" attribute represents the major and minor
   version number of the library and its format is "M.N".  Both numbers
   are one byte in size, see the "libraryVersion" member of the CK_INFO
   structure in [pkcs11_spec] for more information.  Value "M" for the
   attribute must be interpreted as "M" for the major and "0" for the
   minor version of the library.  If the attribute is present the major
   version number is mandatory.

   An empty PKCS#11 URI path attribute that does allow for an empty
   value matches a corresponding structure member or an object attribute
   with an empty value.  Note that according to the PKCS#11
   specification [pkcs11_spec], empty character values in a PKCS#11 API
   producer must be padded with spaces and should not be NULL
   terminated.

3.4.  PKCS#11 URI Scheme Query Attribute Semantics

   An application may always ask for a PIN by any means it decides to.
   What is more, in order not to limit PKCS#11 URI portability the "pin-
   source" attribute value format and interpretation is left to be
   implementation specific.  However, we recommend the certain rules to
   be followed in descending order for the value of the "pin-source"
   attribute:

   o  if the value represents a local absolute path the implementation
      should use it as a PIN file containing the PIN value

   o  if the value contains "|<absolute-command-path>" the
      implementation should read the PIN from the output of an
      application specified with absolute path "<absolute-command-
      path>".  Note that character "|" representing a pipe does not have
      to be percent encoded in the query component of the PKCS#11 URI.

   o  if the value represents a URI treat it as an object containing the
      PIN.  Such a URI may be "file:", "https:", another PKCS#11 URI, or
      something else.

   o  interpret the value as needed in an implementation dependent way

   If a URI contains both "pin-source" and "pin-value" query attributes
   the URI should be refused as invalid.

   Use of the "pin-value" attribute may have security related
   consequences.  Section 6 should be consulted before this attribute is

   ever used.  Standard percent encoding rules should be followed for
   the attribute value.

   A consumer of PKCS#11 URIs may modify default settings for accessing
   a PKCS#11 provider or providers by accepting query component
   attributes "module-name" and "module-path"."

   Processing the URI query module attributes should follow these rules:

   o  attribute "module-name" is expected to contain a case-insensitive
      PKCS#11 module name (not path nor filename) without system
      specific affixes.  Such affix could be an ".so" or ".DLL" suffix,
      or a "lib" prefix, for example.  Not using system specific affixes
      is expected to increase portability of PKCS#11 URIs among
      different systems.  A URI consumer searching for PKCS#11 modules
      is expected to use a system or application specific locations to
      find modules based on the name provided in the attribute.

   o  attribute "module-path" is expected to contain a system specific
      absolute path to the PKCS#11 module, or a system specific absolute
      path to the directory of where PKCS#11 modules are located.

   o  the URI consumer may refuse to accept either of the attributes, or
      both.  If use of an attribute present in the URI string is not
      accepted a warning message should be presented to the provider of
      the URI.

   o  if either of the module attributes is present, only those modules
      found matching these query attributes should be used to search for
      an object represented by the URI.

   o  use of the module attributes does not suppress matching of any
      other URI path component attributes present in a URI.

   o  semantics of using both attributes in the same URI string is
      implementation specific but such use should be avoided.  Attribute
      "module-name" is preferred to "module-path" due to its system
      independent nature but the latter may be more suitable for
      development and debugging.

   o  a URI may not contain multiple module attributes of the same name.

   Use of the module attributes may have security related consequences.
   Section 6 should be consulted before these attribute are ever used.

   A word "module" was chosen over word "library" in these query
   attribute names to avoid confusion with semantically different
   library attributes used in the URI path component.

3.5.  PKCS#11 URI Matching Guidelines

   The PKCS#11 URI can identify PKCS#11 storage objects, tokens, or
   Cryptoki libraries.  Note that since a URI may identify three
   different types of entities the context within which the URI is used
   may be needed to determine the type.  For example, a URI with only
   library attributes may either represent all objects in all tokens in
   all Cryptoki libraries identified by the URI, all tokens in those
   libraries, or just the libraries.

   The following guidelines should help a PKCS#11 URI consumer (eg. an
   application accepting PKCS#11 URIs) to match the URI with the desired
   resource.

   o  the consumer must know whether the URI is to identify PKCS#11
      storage object(s), token(s), or Cryptoki producer(s).

   o  if the consumer is willing to accept query component module
      attributes only those PKCS#11 providers matching these attributes
      should be worked with.  See Section 3.4 for more information.

   o  an unrecognized attribute in the URI path component, including a
      vendor specific attribute, should result in an empty set of
      matched resources.  The consumer should consider whether an error
      message presented to the user is appropriate in such a case.

   o  an unrecognized attribute in the URI query should be ignored.  The
      consumer should consider whether a warning message presented to
      the user is appropriate in such a case.

   o  an attribute not present in the URI path but known to a consumer
      matches everything.  Each additional attribute present in the URI
      path further restricts the selection.

   o  a logical extension of the above is that an empty URI path matches
      everything.  For example, if used to identify storage objects it
      matches all accessible objects in all tokens provided by all
      PKCS#11 API producers found in the system.

   o  use of PIN attributes may change the set of storage objects
      visible to the consumer.

   o  in addition to query component attributes defined in this
      document, vendor specific query attributes may contain further
      information about how to perform the selection or other related
      information.

3.6.  PKCS#11 URI Comparison

   Comparison of two URIs is a way of determining whether the URIs are
   equivalent without comparing the actual resource the URIs point to.
   The comparison of URIs aims to minimize false negatives while
   strictly avoiding false positives.

   Two PKCS#11 URIs are said to be equal if URIs as character strings
   are identical as specified in Section 6.2.1 of [RFC3986], or if both
   following rules are fulfilled:

   o  set of attributes present in the URI is equal.  Note that the
      ordering of attributes in the URI string is not significant for
      the mechanism of comparison.

   o  values of respective attributes are equal based on rules specified
      below

   The rules for comparing values of respective attributes are:

   o  values of path component attributes "library-description",
      "library-manufacturer", "manufacturer", "model", "object",
      "serial", "token", "type", and query component attribute "module-
      name" must be compared using a simple string comparison as
      specified in Section 6.2.1 of [RFC3986] after the case and the
      percent-encoding normalization are both applied as specified in
      Section 6.2.2 of [RFC3986].

   o  value of attribute "id" must be compared using the simple string
      comparison after all bytes are percent-encoded using uppercase
      letters for digits A-F.

   o  value of "pin-source", if deemed containing the filename with the
      PIN value, must be compared using the simple string comparison
      after the full syntax based normalization as specified in
      Section 6.2.2 of [RFC3986] is applied.  If value of the "pin-
      source" attribute is believed to be overloaded it is recommended
      to perform case and percent-encoding normalization before the
      values are compared but the exact mechanism of comparison is left
      to the application.

   o  value of attribute "module-path" must be compared using the simple
      string comparison after the full syntax based normalization as
      specified in Section 6.2.2 of [RFC3986] is applied.

   o  value of attribute "library-version" must be processed as a
      specific scheme-based normalization permitted by Section 6.2.3 of
      [RFC3986].  The value must be split into a major and minor version

      with character '.' (dot) serving as a delimiter.  Library version
      "M" must be treated as "M" for the major version and "0" for the
      minor version.  Resulting minor and major version numbers must be
      then separately compared numerically.

   o  when comparing vendor specific attributes it is recommended to
      perform case and percent-encoding normalization before the values
      are compared but the exact mechanism of comparison is left to the
      application.

4.  Examples of PKCS#11 URIs

   This section contains some examples of how PKCS#11 token objects,
   PKCS#11 tokens, and PKCS#11 libraries can be identified using the
   PKCS#11 URI scheme.  Note that in some of the following examples,
   newlines and spaces were inserted for better readability.  As
   specified in Appendix C of [RFC3986], whitespace should be ignored
   when extracting the URI.  Also note that all spaces as part of the
   URI are percent-encoded, as specified in Appendix A of [RFC3986].

   An empty PKCS#11 URI might be useful to PKCS#11 consumers.  See
   Section 3.5 for more information on semantics of such a URI.

     pkcs11:

   One of the simplest and most useful forms might be a PKCS#11 URI that
   specifies only an object label and its type.  The default token is
   used so the URI does not specify it.  Note that when specifying
   public objects, a token PIN might not be required.

     pkcs11:object=my-pubkey;type=public

   When a private key is specified either the "pin-source" attribute,
   "pin-value, or an application specific method would be usually used.
   Note that '/' is not percent-encoded in the "pin-source" attribute
   value since this attribute is part of the query component, not the
   path, and thus is separated by '?' from the rest of the URI.

     pkcs11:object=my-key;type=private?pin-source=/etc/token

   The following example identifies a certificate in the software token.
   Note an empty value for the attribute "serial".  Also note that the
   "id" attribute value is entirely percent-encoded, as recommended.
   While ',' is in the reserved set it does not have to be percent-
   encoded since it does not conflict with any sub-delimiters used.  The
   '#' character as in "The Software PKCS#11 Softtoken" must be percent-
   encoded.

     pkcs11:token=The%20Software%20PKCS%2311%20Softtoken;
            manufacturer=Snake%20Oil,%20Inc.;
            model=1.0;
            object=my-certificate;
            type=cert;
            id=%69%95%3E%5C%F4%BD%EC%91;
            serial=
            ?pin-source=/etc/token_pin

   The next example covers how to use the "module-name" query attribute.
   Considering that the module is located in /usr/lib/libmypkcs11.so.1
   file, the attribute value is "mypkcs11", ie.  only the module name
   without the full path, and without the platform specific "lib" prefix
   and ".so.1" suffix.

     pkcs11:object=my-sign-key;
            type=private
            ?module-name=mypkcs11

   The following example covers how to use the "module-path" query
   attribute.  The attribute may be useful if a user needs to provide
   the key via a PKCS#11 module stored on a removable media, for
   example.

     pkcs11:object=my-sign-key;
            type=private
            ?module-path=/mnt/libmypkcs11.so.1

   In the context where a token is expected the token can be identified
   without specifying any PKCS#11 objects.  A PIN might still be needed
   in the context of listing all objects in the token, for example.
   Section 6 should be consulted before the "pin-value" attribute is
   ever used.

     pkcs11:token=Software%20PKCS%2311%20softtoken;
            manufacturer=Snake%20Oil,%20Inc.
            ?pin-value=the-pin

Internet-Draft           The PKCS#11 URI Scheme           September 2014


   The Cryptoki library alone can be also identified without specifying
   a PKCS#11 token or object.

     pkcs11:library-manufacturer=Snake%20Oil,%20Inc.;
            library-description=Soft%20Token%20Library;
            library-version=1.23

   The following example shows that the attribute value can contain a
   semicolon.  In such case, it is percent-encoded.  The token attribute
   value must be read as "My token; created by Joe".  Lower case letters
   can also be used in percent-encoding as shown below in the "id"
   attribute value but note that Sections 2.1 and 6.2.2.1 of [RFC3986]
   read that all percent-encoded characters should use the uppercase
   hexadecimal digits.  More specifically, if the URI string was to be
   compared, the algorithm defined in Section 3.6 explicitly requires
   percent-encoding to use the uppercase digits A-F in the "id"
   attribute values.  And as explained in Section 3.3, library version
   "3" should be interpreted as "3" for the major and "0" for the minor
   version of the library.

     pkcs11:token=My%20token%25%20created%20by%20Joe;
            library-version=3;
            id=%01%02%03%Ba%dd%Ca%fe%04%05%06

   If there is any need to include literal "%;" substring, for example,
   both characters must be escaped.  The token value must be read as "A
   name with a substring %;".

     pkcs11:token=A%20name%20with%20a%20substring%20%25%3B;
            object=my-certificate;
            type=cert
            ?pin-source=/etc/token_pin

   The next example includes a small A with acute in the token name.  It
   must be encoded in octets according to the UTF-8 character encoding
   and then percent-encoded.  Given that a small A with acute is U+225
   unicode code point, the UTF-8 encoding is 195 161 in decimal, and
   that is "%C3%A1" in percent-encoding.

     pkcs11:token=Name%20with%20a%20small%20A%20with%20acute:%20%C3%A1;
            object=my-certificate;
            type=cert

   Both the path and query components may contain vendor specific
   attributes.  Attributes in the query component may be delimited by
   either ';' or '&'.  We use '&' in the example that follows.

     pkcs11:token=my-token;
            object=my-certificate;
            type=cert;
            x-vend-aaa=value-a
            ?pin-source=/etc/token_pin&
            x-vend-bbb=value-b

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document moves the "pkcs11" URI scheme from the provisional to
   the permanent URI scheme registry.  The registration template for the
   URI scheme is accessible on http://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-
   schemes.

6.  Security Considerations

   There are general security considerations for URI schemes discussed
   in Section 7 of [RFC3986].

   From those security considerations, Section 7.1 of [RFC3986] applies
   since there is no guarantee that the same PKCS#11 URI will always
   identify the same object, token, or a library in the future.

   Section 7.2 of [RFC3986] applies since by accepting query component
   attributes "module-name" or "module-path" the consumer potentially
   allows loading of arbitrary code into a process.

   Section 7.5 of [RFC3986] applies since the PKCS#11 URI may be used in
   world readable command line arguments to run applications, stored in
   public configuration files, or otherwise used in clear text.  For
   that reason the "pin-value" attribute should only be used if the URI
   string itself is protected with the same level of security as the
   token PIN by itself otherwise is.
