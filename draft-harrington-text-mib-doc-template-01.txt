   MIB module document, but does not provide a template for writing the
   MIB module itself.

   For updated information on MIB module guidelines and templates, see
   [RFC4181] and http://www.ops.ietf.org/.

   For information on writing internet drafts or RFCs, see
   http://www.ietf.org/ietf/1id-guidelines.txt and RFC2223(bis), and
   look at http://www.ietf.org/ID-Checklist.html for issues to note when
   writing drafts.

   This template is not meant to be a conclusive list of everything
   needed to write MIB module documents, but to summarize the often-
   needed basic features to get a document containing a MIB module
   started.  An important purpose of the template is to aid authors in
   developing a document that is laid out in a manner consistent with
   other documents containing MIB modules.  Documents submitted for
   advancement to the standards track typically require review by a MIB
   Doctor.  This template standardizes the layout and naming of
   sections, includes the appropriate boilerplate text, and facilitates
   the development of tools to automate the checking of MIB module
   documents, to speed the WG and IESG review processes.

   An XML template is also available.  For information on XML2RFC, see
   RFC2629 [RFC2629],
   http://xml.resource.org/public/rfc/html/rfc2629.html and "bis":
   http://xml.resource.org/authoring/draft-mrose-writing-rfcs.html.
   Also see http://xml.resource.org/authoring/README.html for 'rfc'
   option strings.  The benefit of using the XML version of the template
   is that comments in the XML describe how to fill in each section of
   the template, and then XML2RFC will generate the actual internet-
   draft with your information.  XML2RFC automatically handles much of
   the boilerplate, references, and idnits issues for you.

   [TODO]: please remove this Note prior to publication.

Internet-Draft      MIB Module Document Text Template       October 2006


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols.  In particular it defines
   objects for managing the [TODO]

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

4.  Overview

5.  Structure of the MIB Module

5.1.  Textual Conventions

5.2.  The [TODO] Subtree

5.3.  The Notifications Subtree

6.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

   Some management objects defined in other MIB modules are applicable
   to an entity implementing this MIB.  In particular, it is assumed
   that an entity implementing the SAMPLE-MIB module will also implement
   the 'system' group of the SNMPv2-MIB [RFC3418] and the 'interfaces'
   group of the IF-MIB [RFC2863].

Internet-Draft      MIB Module Document Text Template       October 2006


6.1.  Relationship to the SNMPv2-MIB

   The 'system' group in the SNMPv2-MIB [RFC3418] is defined as being
   mandatory for all systems, and the objects apply to the entity as a
   whole.  The 'system' group provides identification of the management
   entity and certain other system-wide data.  The SAMPLE-MIB does not
   duplicate those objects.

6.2.  Relationship to the IF-MIB

   The Interface MIB [RFC2863] requires that any MIB module which is an
   adjunct of the Interface MIB clarify specific areas within the
   Interface MIB.  These areas were intentionally left vague in the
   Interface MIB to avoid over constraining the MIB, thereby precluding
   management of certain media-types.

   Section 4 of [RFC2863] enumerates several areas which a media-
   specific MIB must clarify.  The implementor is referred to [RFC2863]
   in order to understand the general intent of these areas.

6.3.  MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   The following MIB module IMPORTS objects from SNMPv2-SMI [RFC2578],
   SNMPv2-TC [RFC2579], SNMPv2-CONF [RFC2580], and IF-MIB [RFC2863]

7.  Definitions





8.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  [TODO] list the writable tables and objects and state why they are
      sensitive.

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this
   MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an
   intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB

   module via direct SNMP SET operations.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  [TODO] list the tables and objects and state why they are
      sensitive.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

9.  IANA Considerations

   [TODO} select an option and provide the necessary details.

   Option #1:

Internet-Draft      MIB Module Document Text Template       October 2006


        The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
        OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

        Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
        ----------        -----------------------

        sampleMIB  { mib-2 XXX }

   Option #2:

   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
   requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and
   to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  When the
   assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXX"
   (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove
   this note.

   Note well: prior to official assignment by the IANA, a draft document
   MUST use placeholders (such as "XXX" above) rather than actual
   numbers.  See RFC4181 Section 4.5 for an example of how this is done
   in a draft MIB module.

   Option #3:

   This memo includes no request to IANA.
