   community.  In particular, it defines managed objects for MAP
   encapsulation (MAP-E) mode.

1.  Introduction

   MAP [RFC7597] is a stateless mechanism for running IPv4 over
   IPv6-only infrastructure.  In particular, it includes two mode,
   translation mode or encapsulation mode.  For the encapsulation mode,
   it provides an automatic tunnelling mechanism for providing IPv4
   connectivity service to end users over a service provider's IPv6
   network

   This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base
   (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet
   community.  This MIB module would be used for monitoring the devices
   in the MAP scenario, especially, for the encapsulation mode.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the

   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in
   [RFC2578], [RFC2579] and [RFC2580].

3.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

4.  Structure of the MIB Module

   The MAP-E MIB provides a way to configure and monitor the MAP devices
   in MAP encapsulation mode through SNMP.

   MAP-E MIB is configurable on a per-interface basis.  It depends on
   several parts of the IF-MIB[RFC2863].

4.1.  The mapMIBObjects

4.1.1.  The mapRule Subtree

   The mapRule subtree describes managed objects used for managing the
   multiple mapping rules in the MAP encapsulation mode.

   According to the MAP specification[RFC7597], the mapping rules are
   divided into two categories, which are Basic Mapping Rule (BMR), and
   Forwarding Mapping Rule (FMR).

4.1.2.  The mapSecurityCheck Subtree

   The mapSecurityCheck subtree is to statistic the number of invalid
   packets that have been identified.  There are two kind of invalid
   packets which are defined in the MAP specification [RFC7597]as below.

   - The BR MUST perform a validation of the consistency of the source
   IPv6 address and source port number for the packet using BMR.

   - The Customer Edge (CE) SHOULD check that MAP received packets'
   transport-layer destination port number is in the range configured by
   MAP for the CE.

4.2.  The mapMIBConformance Subtree

   The mapMIBConformance subtree provides conformance information of MIB
   objects.

6.  IANA Considerations

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

         Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
         ----------        -----------------------
         MAP-E-MIB          { mib-2 XXX }

7.  Security Considerations

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this
   MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an
   intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB
   module via direct SNMP SET operations.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the objects and their sensitivity/
   vulnerability:

      mapRuleIPv6PrefixType

      mapRuleIPv6Prefix

      mapRuleIPv6PrefixLen

      mapRuleIPv4PrefixType

      mapRuleIPv4Prefix

      mapRuleIPv4PrefixLen

      mapRuleBRIPv6Address

      mapRulePSID

      mapRulePSIDLen

      mapRuleOffset

      mapRuleEALen

      mapRuleType

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the
   SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming
   compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for
   authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)
   [RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].  Implementations
   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
   [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH
   [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
