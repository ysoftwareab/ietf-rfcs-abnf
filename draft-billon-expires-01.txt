            Updated Use of the Expires Message Header Field
                        draft-billon-expires-01

Abstract

   This document allows broader use of the Expires message header field
   for SMTP.  Senders can then indicate when a message sent becomes
   valueless and can safely be deleted, while recipients would use the
   information to delete these valueless messages.

1.  Introduction

   The date and time of expiration can be used by the mailbox provider
   or the MUA to indicate to the user that certain messages could be
   deleted, in an attempt to unclutter the user's mailbox and spare
   storage resources.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Header Field example

   The field definition and syntax remain the same.

   expires = "Expires" ":" date-time

   Example:

   Expires: Wed, 1 Dec 2021 17:22:57 +0000

   Senders MUST NOT include more than one Expires header in the message
   they send.

   If there is more than one Expires header then receivers SHOULD treat
   this as if no Expires header is present.

3.  Security considerations

   Dates in this header can be set a long way in the past or in the
   future, including outside the range of internal time representations
   in some programming environments - all software which processes the
   Expires header MUST be made safe against this possibility.

4.  Advice to Senders

   Senders SHOULD add the header field along with a relevant date and
   time when they know that the content of the message has no value
   after a given point of time (e.g.  Commercial newsletters
   --especially when including time-limited offers, Event announcements,
   Social notifications, Time-limited access codes ...).

   In all other cases, senders SHOULD NOT set an Expires header.

5.  Advice to Receivers (Mailbox providers, Webmails and MUAs)

   The expiration of a message's validity would logically lead to the
   deletion of the message.  However, users on most systems do not
   expect their emails to disappear, and may not be aware that any
   particular email has an Expires header.  Therefore, no email should
   be silently and automatically deleted solely based on the value of
   the Expires header field.

   Mailbox providers SHOULD explain to users how the information
   provided in the Expires header are processed, SHOULD indicate when
   viewing an expired message, and SHOULD give users control over the
   actions to take for expired messages.

   The information provided in the header should be used as a signal
   that could be used to provide a feature or improved experience to the
   end-user.  For instance, systems may allow users to set up an
   automatic rule to clean up expired email from specific senders or
   with specific characteristics, or provide a mode to quickly view and
   process all expired email.

   In certain cases, email messages can be used as proof or element of
   investigation.  As an early deletion may compromise the intended
   investigation, mailbox providers can ignore the Expires information
   in such cases.

   Presence of the Expires header field MUST NOT be interpreted as a
   sign of legitimacy.

6.  Past History of the Expires: header

   [RFC4021] defines a number of header fields that can be added to
   Internet messages such as those used for mapping between X.400 and
   RFC822/MIME [RFC2156].  One of them is the Expires header field that
   provides the date and time at which a message is considered to lose
   its validity.

   The same principle can be applied to the Expires header field in a
   SMTP context, whether the message comes from a X.400 gateway as
   initially intended in [RFC2156], or from a RFC821/SMTP MTA.
