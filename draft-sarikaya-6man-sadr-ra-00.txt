          IPv6 RA Options for Source Address Dependent Routing
                     draft-sarikaya-6man-sadr-ra-00

Abstract

   This document proposes the router advertisement extensions for source
   address dependent routing.  New Router Advertisement options are
   defined for configuring route prefixes and their corresponding source
   prefixes on the mobile or fixed nodes.  Using these options, an
   operator can easily configure nodes with multiple interfaces (or
   otherwise multi-homed) to enable them to select the routes to a
   destination.  Each option is defined together with definitions of
   host and router behaviors.

1.  Introduction

   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery and IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration
   protocols can be used to configure fixed and mobile nodes with
   various parameters related to addressing and routing [RFC4861],
   [RFC4862], [RFC4191].  DNS Recursive Server Addresses and Domain Name
   Search Lists are additional parameters that can be configured using
   router advertisements [RFC6106].

   Router Advertisements can also be used to configure fixed and mobile
   nodes in multi-homed scenarios with route information and source
   address/prefix.  Different scenarios exist such as the node is
   simultaneously connected to multiple access network of e.g.  WiFi and
   3G.  The node may also be connected to more than one gateway.  Such
   connectivity may be realized by means of dedicated physical or
   logical links that may also be shared with other users nodes such as
   in residential access networks.

   Host configuration can be done using DHCPv6 or using router
   advertisements.  A comparison of DHCPv6 and RA based host
   configuration approaches is presented in
   [I-D.yourtchenko-ra-dhcpv6-comparison].

Internet-Draft               New RA Options                   March 2015


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Default Route Configuration

   A host, usually a mobile host interested in obtaining routing
   information usually sends a Router Solicitation (RS) message on the
   link.  The router, when configured to do so, provides the route
   information using zero, one or more Route Information options in the
   router advertisement (RA) messages sent in response.

   The route options are extensible, as well as convey detailed
   information for routes.

   Source address/prefix and related route information are provided
   directly by the next hop routers.  In this document we assume that
   next hop routers are able to provide this information.

   A non-trustworthy network may be available at the same time as a
   trustworthy network, with the risk of bad consequences if the host
   gets confused between the two.  These are basically the two models
   for hosts with multiple interfaces, both of which are valid, but
   which are incompatible with each other.  In the first model, an
   interface is connected to something like a corporate network, over a
   Virtual Private Network (VPN).  This connection is trusted because it
   has been authenticated.  Routes obtained over such a connection can
   probably be trusted, and indeed it may be important to use those
   routes.  This is because in the VPN case, you may also be connected
   to a network that's offered you a default route, and you could be
   attacked over that connection if you attempt to connect to resources
   on the enterprise network over it.

   On the other, non-trustworthy network scenario, none of the networks
   to which the host is connected are meaningfully more or less
   trustworthy.  In this scenario, the untrustworthy network may hand
   out routes to other hosts, e.g. those in the VPN going through some
   malicious nodes.  This will have bad consequences because the host's
   traffic intended for the corporate VPN may be hijacked by the
   intermediate nodes.

   Router advertisement extensions described in this document can be
   used to install the routes.  However, the use of such a technique
   makes sense only in the former case above, i.e. trusted network.  So
   the host MUST have an authenticated connection to the network it

   connects so that the router advertisements can be trusted before
   establishing routes.

4.  Source Address Dependent Routing

   In multihomed networks there is a need to do source address based
   routing if some providers are performing the ingress filtering
   defined in BCP38 [RFC2827].  This requires the routers to consider
   the source addresses as well as the destination addresses in
   determining the next hop to send the packet to.

   The routers may be informed about the source addresses to use in
   routing using extensions to the routing protocols like IS-IS defined
   in [ISO.10589.1992] [I-D.baker-ipv6-isis-dst-src-routing] and OSPF
   defined in [RFC5340] [I-D.baker-ipv6-ospf-dst-src-routing].  In this
   document we define the router advertisement extensions for source
   address dependent routing.

   Routing protocol extensions for source address dependent routing does
   not avoid a host using a source address that may be subject to
   ingress filtering when sending a packet to one of the next hops.  In
   that case the host receives an ICMP source address failed ingress/
   egress policy error message in which case the host must resend the
   packet trying a different source address.  The extensions defined in
   this document aims at avoiding this inefficiency in packet forwarding
   at the host.

   More information on the scenarios, their analysis and why host based
   approach to source address dependent routing is needed, are presented
   in [I-D.sarikaya-6man-sadr-overview].

5.  Host Configuration

   Router advertisement options defined in this document are used by
   Type C hosts.

   As defined in [RFC4191] Type C host uses a Routing Table instead of a
   Default Router List.

   The hosts set up their routing tables based on the router
   advertisement extensions defined in this document.  The routes
   established are used in forwarding the packets to a next hop based on
   the destination prefix/address using the longest match algorithm.
   The hosts MUST keep Route Prefix that it received together with
   Source Address options in a stable storage.  This will enable the
   host to consistently use these options as described next.

Internet-Draft               New RA Options                   March 2015


   In case the host receives Router Prefix option with Source Address,
   the host uses source and destination prefix/address using the longest
   match algorithm in order to send its packets to this next hop router.

6.  Router Configuration

   The router MAY send one or more Route Prefix options that represent
   the IPv6 destination prefixes reachable via the given next hop.
   Router includes Route Prefix option and Source Prefix in the message
   to indicate that given prefix is available directly on-link and that
   any source addresses derived from the source prefix will not be
   subject to ingress filtering on these routes supported by these next
   hops.

   For the Source Address, Source Prefix option is used with prefix
   length set to 128.

   Each Route Prefix may be associated with zero, one or more Source
   Prefixes that represent the source addresses that are assigned from
   the prefixes that belong to this router.  Route Prefix options
   represent the IPv6 destination prefixes reachable via the given next
   hop.  Router includes Route Prefix option defined in Figure 2 in the
   message to indicate that given prefix is available directly on-link.
   Route Prefix option MUST be followed by a Source Prefix option
   defined in Section 8 to indicate that any source addresses derived
   from the source prefix will not be subject to ingress filtering on
   these routes supported by these next hops.

   In home networks, there is possibility of configuring each interface
   of the host using Router Advertisements sent from their next hop
   routers.  This brings the need for a new option, Router Prefix with
   Source Address Option defined in Figure 3 to indicate that any source
   addresses derived from the source prefix will not be subject to
   ingress filtering on these routes supported by this router.

7.  RA Packet Size and Router Issues

   The options defined in this document are to be used on multi-homed
   hosts.  A mobile host would typically have two interfaces, Wi-Fi and
   3G but hosts with 3 or 4 interfaces may also exist.  Configuring such
   hosts using the options defined in this document brings up the RA
   packet size issue, i.e. the packet size should not exceed the maximum
   transmission unit (MTU) of the link.

   Total size of all options defined in this document is 40 octets.
   Considering that 1500 bytes is the minimum MTU configured by the vast
   majority of links in the Internet the hosts with 3-4 interfaces or

Internet-Draft               New RA Options                   March 2015


   links can be easily configured by a single router advertisement
   message carrying the options defined here.

   The routes advertised have route lifetime values.  The host considers
   the routes in its routing table stale when the lifetime expires.  The
   router MUST refresh these routes periodically in order to avoid stale
   routing table entries in the hosts.

   In some cases the mobile devices with multiple interfaces become
   routers.  Such devices may configure their routing tables using
   routing protocols such as RIPng or OSPFv3 [RFC7157].  RA based
   approach described in this document can also be used to configure
   such hosts.

   Neighbor Discovery is subject to attacks that cause IP packets to
   flow to unexpected places.  Because of this, neighbor discovery
   messages SHOULD be secured, possibly using Secure Neighbor Discovery
   (SEND) protocol [RFC3971].
