Abstract

   Authorization is a key function in presence systems.  Authorization
   policies, also known as authorization rules, specify what presence
   information can be given to which watchers, and when.  This
   specification defines an Extensible Markup Language (XML) document
   format for expressing presence authorization rules.  Such a document
   can be manipulated by clients using the XML Configuration Access
   Protocol (XCAP), although other techniques are permitted.

Internet-Draft           Presence Authorization                July 2005


1.  Introduction

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for Instant Messaging and
   Presence (SIMPLE) specifications allow a user, called a watcher, to
   subscribe to another user, called a presentity [19], in order to
   learn their presence information [22].  This subscription is handled
   by a presence agent.  However, presence information is sensitive, and
   a presence agent needs authorization from the presentity prior to
   handing out presence information.  As such, a presence authorization
   document format is needed.  This specification defines a format for
   such a document, called a presence authorization document.

   [12] specifies a framework for representing authorization policies,
   and is applicable to systems such as geo-location and presence.  This
   framework is used as the basis for presence authorization documents.
   In the framework, an authorization policy is a set of rules.  Each
   rule contains conditions, actions, and transformations.  The
   conditions specify under what conditions the rule is to be applied to
   presence server processing.  The actions element tells the server
   what actions to take.  The transformations element indicates how the
   presence data is to be manipulated before being presented to that
   watcher, and as such, defines a privacy filtering operation. [12]
   identifies a small number of specific conditions, actions and
   permissions common to presence and location services, and leaves it
   to other specifications, such as this one, to fill in usage specific
   details.

   A presence authorization document can be manipulated by clients using
   several means.  One such mechanism is the XML Configuration Access
   Protocol (XCAP) [2].  This specification defines the details
   necessary for using XCAP to manage presence authorization documents.

2.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1] and
   indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations.

3.  Structure of Presence Authorization Documents

   A presence authorization document is an XML document, formatted
   according to the schema defined in [12].  Presence authorization
   documents inherit the MIME type of common policy documents,
   application/auth-policy+xml.  As described in [12], this document is
   composed of three parts - conditions, actions, and transformations.
   Each action or transformation, which is also called a permission, has
   the property of being a positive grant of information to the watcher.



Rosenberg               Expires January 19, 2006                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft           Presence Authorization                July 2005


   As a result, there is a well-defined mechanism for combining actions
   and transformations obtained from several sources.  This mechanism is
   privacy safe, since the lack of any action or transformation can only
   result in less information being presented to a watcher.

   This section defines the new conditions, actions and transformations
   defined by this specification.

3.1  Conditions

3.1.1  Identity

   Although the <identity> element is defined in [12], that
   specification indicates that the specific usages of the framework
   document need to define details that are protocol and usage specific.
   In particular, it is neccesary for a usage of the common policy
   framework to:

   o  Define how authentication mechanisms for the protocol produce
      identities of the form user@domain.

   o  Define whether those identities are authenticated,
      unauthenticated, or asserted.

   This sub-section defines those details for systems based on [22].

   For requests that are authenticated using  SIP [9] digest
   authentication [8], the identity of the watcher is set equal to the
   user and domain part of the SIP Address of Record (AOR) for the user
   that has authenticated themselves.  For example, consider the
   following "user record":


   SIP AOR: sip:alice@example.com
   digest username: ali
   digest password: f779ajvvh8a6s6
   digest realm: example.com

   If the presence server receives a SUBSCRIBE request, challenges it
   with the realm set to "example.com", and the subsequent SUBSCRIBE
   contains an Authorization header field with a username of "ali" and a
   digest response generated with the password "f779ajvvh8a6s6", the
   identity used in matching operations is "sip:alice@example.com".
   Identities obtained through digest authentication are considered
   "authenticated identities" according to the common policy framework.

   For requests that are authenticated using RFC 3325 [23], the identity
   is equal to the username and domain parts of the SIP URI in the

Internet-Draft           Presence Authorization                July 2005


   P-Asserted-ID header field.  These identities are considered
   "asserted identities" according to the common policy framework.  If
   the P-Asserted-ID header field only contains a tel URI [18], it is
   not possible to obtain an identity of the form user@domain.  As such,
   the identity for such requests is considered undefined, and thus
   equivalent to an unauthenticated identity.

   For requests that are authenticated using the SIP Identity mechanism
   [14], the common policy identity is equal to the username and domain
   part of the URI in the From header field of the request, assuming
   that the signature in the Identity header field has been validated.
   These identities are considered "asserted identities" according to
   the common policy framework.

   In SIP systems, it is possible for a user to have aliases - that is,
   there are multiple SIP AOR "assigned" to a single user.  In terms of
   this specification, there is no relationship between those aliases.
   Each would look like a different user.  This will be the consequence
   for systems were the watcher is in a different domain than the
   presentity.  However, even if the watcher and presentity are in the
   same domain, and the presence server knows that there are aliases for
   the watcher, these aliases are not mapped to each other or used in
   any way.

   SIP also allows for anonymous requests.  The request is considered
   anonymous if it was authenticated by the presence server using the
   <anonymous> username defined in RFC 3261, if the asserted identity
   [23] has a URI in the "anonymous.invalid" domain [17], or if the From
   field has a username of anonymous within some domain, and the
   Identity header field is present with a valid signature provided by
   that domain [14].  The common policy framework does not have any
   support for anonymous identities.  As such, if a SIP request is
   anonymous, it is equivalent to unauthenticated as far as the common
   policy framework.

3.1.2  Sphere

   The <sphere> element is defined in [12].  However, each application
   making use of the common policy specification needs to determine how
   the presence server computes the value of the sphere to be used in
   the evaluation of the condition.

   To compute the value of <sphere>, the presence agent examines all
   published presence documents for the presentity.  If at least one of
   them include the <sphere> element [13] as part of the person data
   component [15], and all of those containing the element have the same
   value for it, that is the value used for the sphere in common policy
   processing.  If, however, the <sphere> element was not present in any

Internet-Draft           Presence Authorization                July 2005


   of the published documents, or it was present but had inconsistent
   values, its value is considered undefined in terms of common policy
   processing.

   Care must be taken in using <sphere> as a condition for determining
   the subscription handling.  Since the value of <sphere> changes
   dynamically, a state change can cause a subscription to be suddenly
   terminated.  The watcher has no way to know, aside from polling, when
   their subscription would be re-instated as the value of <sphere>
   changes.  For this reason, <sphere> is primarily useful for matching
   on rules that define transformations.

3.2  Actions

3.2.1  Subscription Handling

   The <sub-handling> element specifies the subscription authorization
   decision that the server should make.  It also specifies whether or
   not the presence document for the watcher should be constructed using
   "polite blocking" or not.  Usage of polite blocking and the
   subscription authorization decision are specified jointly since
   proper privacy handling requires a correlation between them.  As
   discussed in [12], since the combination algorithm runs independently
   for each permission, if correlations exist between permissions, they
   must be merged into a single variable.  That is what is done here.
   The <sub-handling> element is an enumerated Integer type.  The
   defined values are:

   block: This action tells the server to place the subscription in the
      rejected state.  It has the value of zero, and it represents the
      default value.  No value of the sub-handling element can ever be
      lower than this.  Strictly speaking, it is not necessary to every
      include an explicit block action, since the default in the absence
      of any action will be block.  However, it is included for
      completeness.

   confirm: This action tells the server to place the subscription in
      the "pending" state, and await input from the presentity to
      determine how to proceed.  It has a value of one.

   polite-block: This action tells the server to place the subscription
      into the "accepted" state, and to produce a presence document that
      indicates that the presentity is unavailable.  A reasonable
      document would exclude device and person information elements, and
      include only a single service whose basic status is set to closed
      [3].  This action has a value of two.

Internet-Draft           Presence Authorization                July 2005


   allow: This action tells the server to place the subscription into
      the "accepted" state.  This action has a value of three.

      NOTE WELL: Placing a value of block for this element does not
      guarantee that a subscription is denied!  If any matching rule has
      any other value for this element, the subscription will receive
      treatment based on the maximum of those other values.  This is
      based on the combining rules defined in [12].

   Future specifications can define additional values for this
   permission, allowing for the selection of other composition policies.

   The exact behavior of a presence server upon a change in the sub-
   handling value can be described by utilizing the subscription
   processing state machine in Figure 1 of RFC 3857 [10].  Each
   subscription is associated with a set of permissions that represents
   the combination of all permissions that apply to that subscription,
   using the combining rules in [12].

   If the sub-handling permission changes value to "block", this causes
   a "rejected" event to be generated into the subscription state
   machine for all affected subscriptions.  This will cause the state
   machine to move into the terminated state, resulting in the
   transmission of a NOTIFY to the watcher with a Subscription-State
   header field with value "terminated" and a reason of "rejected" [11],
   which terminates their subscription.  If a new subscription arrives
   later on, and the value of sub-handling that applies to that
   subscription is "block", the subscription processing follows the
   "subscribe, policy=reject" branch from the init state, and a 403
   response to the SUBSCRIBE is generated.

   If the sub-handling permission changes value to confirm, the
   processing depends on the states of the affected subscriptions.
   Unfortunately, the state machine in RFC 3857 does not define an event
   corresponding to an authorization decision of "pending".  If the
   subscription is in the active state, it moves back into the pending
   state.  This causes a NOTIFY to be sent, updating the Subscription-
   State [11] to "pending".  No reason is included in the Subscription-
   State header field (none are defined to handle this case).  No
   further documents are sent to this watcher.  There is no change in
   state if the subscription is in the pending, waiting or terminated
   states.  If a new subscription arrives later on, and the value of
   sub-handling that apples to that subscription is "pending", the
   subscription processing follows the "subscribe, no policy" branch
   from the init state, and a 202 response to the SUBSCRIBE is
   generated, followed by a NOTIFY with Subscription-State of pending.
   No presence document is included in that NOTIFY.

Internet-Draft           Presence Authorization                July 2005


   If the sub-handling permission changes value to "polite-block" or
   "allow", this causes an "approved" event to be generated into the
   state machine for all affected subscriptions.  This will cause the
   machine to move into the active state if it is currently in pending,
   resulting in the transmission of a NOTIFY with a Subscription-State
   header field of "active", and the inclusion of a presence document in
   that NOTIFY.  If a new subscription arrives later on, and the value
   of sub-handling that applies to that subscription is is "polite-
   block" or "allow", the subscription processing follows the
   "subscribe, policy=accept" branch from the init state, and a 200 OK
   response to the SUBSCRIBE is generated, followed by a NOTIFY with
   Subscription-State of "active" with a presence document in the body
   of the NOTIFY.

3.3  Transformations

   The transformations defined here are used to drive the behavior of
   the privacy filtering operation.  Each transformation defines the
   visibility a watcher is granted to a particular component of the
   presence document.  One group of transformations grant visibility to
   person, device and service data elements based on identifying
   information for those elements.  Another group of transformations
   provide access to particular data elements in the presence document.

3.3.1  Providing Access to Data Component Elements

   The transformations in this section provide access to person, device
   and service data component elements.  Once access has been granted to
   such an element, access to specific presence attributes for that
   element is controlled by the permissions defined in Section 3.3.2.

3.3.1.1  Device Information

   The <provide-devices> permission allows a watcher to see <device>
   information present in the presence document.  It is a set variable.
   Each member of the set provides a way to identify a device or group
   of devices.  This specification defines three types of elements in
   the set - <class>, which identifies a device occurrence by class,
   <device-id>, which identifies a device occurrence by device ID, and
   <occurrence-id>, which identifies a device occurrence by occurrence
   ID.  Each member of the set is identified by its type (class,
   device-id or occurrence-id) and value (value of the class, value of
   the device-id, or value of the occurrence-id).

   For example, consider the following <provide-devices> element:






Rosenberg               Expires January 19, 2006                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft           Presence Authorization                July 2005


   <provide-devices>
     <device-id>urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6</device-id>
     <class>biz</class>
   </provide-devices>

   This set has two members.  This is combined with a <provide-devices>
   element from a different rule:


   <provide-devices>
     <class>home</class>
     <class>biz</class>
   </provide-devices>

   The result of the set combination (using the union operation) is a
   set with four elements:


   <provide-devices>
     <class>home</class>
     <class>biz</class>
     <device-id>urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6</device-id>
   </provide-devices>

   The <provide-devices> element can also take on the special value
   <all-devices> which is a short-hand notation for all device
   occurrences present in the presence document.

   Permission is granted to see a particular device occurrence if one of
   the device identifiers in the set identifies that device occurrence.
   If a <class> permission is granted to the watcher, and the <class> of
   the device occurrence matches the value of the <class> permission
   based on case sensitive equality, the device occurrence is included
   in the presence document.  If a <device-id> permission is granted to
   the watcher, and the <device-id> of the device occurrence matches the
   value of the <device-id> permission based on URI equivalence, the
   device occurrence is included in the presence document.  If a
   <occurrence-id> permission is granted to the watcher, and the
   <occurrence-id> of the device occurrence matches the value of the
   <occurrence-id> permission based on case sensitive equality, the
   device occurrence is included in the presence document.  In addition,
   a device occurrence is included in the presence document if the <all-
   devices> permission was granted to the watcher.

3.3.1.2  Person Information

   The <provide-persons> permission allows a watcher to see the <person>
   information present in the presence document.  It is a set variable.

   Each member of the set provides a way to identify a person
   occurrence.  This specification defines two types of elements in the
   set - <class>, which identifies a person occurrence by class, and
   <occurrence-id>, which identifies an occurrence by its occurrence ID.
   Each member of the set is identified by its type (class or
   occurrence-id) and value (value of the class or value of the
   occurrence-id).  The <provide-persons> element can also take on the
   special value <all-persons> which is a short-hand notation for all
   person occurrences present in the presence document.  The set
   combination is done identically to the <provide-devices> element.

   Permission is granted to see a particular person occurrence if one of
   the person identifiers in the set identifies that person occurrence.
   If a <class> permission is granted to the watcher, and the <class> of
   the person occurrence matches the value of the <class> permission
   based on case sensitive equality, the person occurrence is included
   in the presence document.  If a <occurrence-id> permission is granted
   to the watcher, and the <occurrence-id> of the person occurrence
   matches the value of the <occurrence-id> permission based on case
   sensitive equality, the person occurrence is included in the presence
   document.  In addition, a person occurrence is included in the
   presence document if the <all-persons> permission was granted to the
   watcher.

3.3.1.3  Service Information

   The <provide-services> permission allows a watcher to see service
   information present in <tuple> elements in the presence document.
   Like <provide-devices>, it is a set variable.  Each member of the set
   provides a way to identify a service occurrence.  This specification
   defines four types of elements in the set - <class>, which identifies
   a service occurrence by class, <occurrence-id>, which identifies a
   service by its occurrence ID, <service-uri>, which identifies a
   service by its service URI, and <service-uri-scheme>, which
   identifies a service by its service URI scheme.  Each member of the
   set is identified by its type (class, occurrence-id, service-uri or
   service-uri-scheme) and value (value of the class, value of the
   occurrence-id, value of the service-uri or value of the service-uri-
   scheme ).  The <provide-services> element can also take on the
   special value <all-services> which is a short-hand notation for all
   service occurrences present in the presence document.  The set
   combination is done identically to the <provide-persons> element.

   Permission is granted to see a particular service occurrence if one
   of the service identifiers in the set identifies that service
   occurrence.  If a <class> permission is granted to the watcher, and
   the <class> of the service occurrence matches the value of the
   <class> permission based on case sensitive equality, the service

   occurrence is included in the presence document.  If a <service-uri>
   permission is granted to the watcher, and the <service-uri> of the
   service occurrence matches the value of the <service-uri> permission
   based on URI equivalence, the service occurrence is included in the
   presence document.  If a <occurrence-id> permission is granted to the
   watcher, and the <occurrence-id> of the service occurrence matches
   the value of the <occurrence-id> permission based on case sensitive
   equality, the service occurrence is included in the presence
   document.  If a <service-uri-scheme> permission is granted to the
   watcher, and the scheme of the service URI for the service occurrence
   matches the value of <service-uri-scheme> based on case sensitive
   equality, the service occurrence is included in the presence
   document.  In addition, a service occurrence is included in the
   presence document if the <all-services> permission was granted to the
   watcher.

3.3.2  Providing Access to Presence Attributes

   The permissions of Section 3.3.1 provide coarse grained access to
   presence data by allowing or blocking specific services or devices,
   and allowing or blocking person information.

   Once person, device or service information is included in the
   document, the permissions in this section define which presence
   attributes are reported there.  Certain information is always
   reported.  In particular, the <contact>, <service-class> [13],
   <basic> status and <timestamp> elements in all <tuple> elements, if
   present, are provided to watchers .  The <timestamp> element in all
   <person> elements, if present, is provided to watchers.  The
   <timestampt> and <device-id> elements in all <device> elements, if
   present, is provided to all watchers.

3.3.2.1  Provide Activities

   This permission controls access to the <activities> element defined
   in [13].  The name of the element providing this permission is
   <provide-activities>, and it is a boolean type.  If its value is
   TRUE, then the <activities> element in the person data element is
   reported to the watcher.  If FALSE, this presence attribute is
   removed if present.

3.3.2.2  Provide Class

   This permission controls access to the <class> element defined in
   [13].  The name of the element providing this permission is <provide-
   class>, and it is a boolean type.  If its value is TRUE, then the
   <class> element in the person, service or device data element is
   reported to the watcher.  If FALSE, this presence attribute is

   removed if present.

3.3.2.3  Provide Device ID

   This permission controls access to the <device-id> element defined in
   [13].  The name of the element providing this permission is <provide-
   device-id>, and it is a boolean type.  If its value is TRUE, then the
   <device-id> element in the service data element is reported to the
   watcher.  If FALSE, this presence attribute is removed if present.

3.3.2.4  Provide Mood

   This permission controls access to the <mood> element defined in
   [13].  The name of the element providing this permission is <provide-
   mood>, and it is a boolean type.  If its value is TRUE, then the
   <mood> element in the person data element is reported to the watcher.
   If FALSE, this presence attribute is removed if present.

3.3.2.5  Provide Place-is

   This permission controls access to the <place-is> element defined in
   [13].  The name of the element providing this permission is <provide-
   place-is>, and it is a boolean type.  If its value is TRUE, then the
   <place-is> element in the person data element is reported to the
   watcher.  If FALSE, this presence attribute is removed if present.

3.3.2.6  Provide Place-type

   This permission controls access to the <place-type> element defined
   in [13].  The name of the element providing this permission is
   <provide-place-type>, and it is a boolean type.  If its value is
   TRUE, then the <place-type> element in the person data element is
   reported to the watcher.  If FALSE, this presence attribute is
   removed if present.

3.3.2.7  Provide Privacy

   This permission controls access to the <privacy> element defined in
   [13].  The name of the element providing this permission is <provide-
   privacy>, and it is a boolean type.  If its value is TRUE, then the
   <privacy> element in the service data element is reported to the
   watcher.  If FALSE, this presence attribute is removed if present.

3.3.2.8  Provide Relationship

   This permission controls access to the <relationship> element defined
   in [13].  The name of the element providing this permission is
   <provide-relationship>, and it is a boolean type.  If its value is

   TRUE, then the <relationship> element in the service data element is
   reported to the watcher.  If FALSE, this presence attribute is
   removed if present.

3.3.2.9  Provide Sphere

   This permission controls access to the <sphere> element defined in
   [13].  The name of the element providing this permission is <provide-
   sphere>, and it is a boolean type.  If its value is TRUE, then the
   <sphere> element in the person data element is reported to the
   watcher.  If FALSE, this presence attribute is removed if present.

3.3.2.10  Provide Status-Icon

   This permission controls access to the <status-icon> element defined
   in [13].  The name of the element providing this permission is
   <provide-status-icon>, and it is a boolean type.  If its value is
   TRUE, then any <status-icon> element in the person or service data
   element is reported to the watcher.  If FALSE, this presence
   attribute is removed if present.

3.3.2.11  Provide Time-Offset

   This permission controls access to the <time-offset> element defined
   in [13].  The name of the element providing this permission is
   <provide-time-offset>, and it is a boolean type.  If its value is
   TRUE, then the <time-offset> element in the person data element is
   reported to the watcher.  If FALSE, this presence attribute is
   removed if present.

3.3.2.12  Provide User-Input

   This permission controls access to the <user-input> element defined
   in [13].  The name of the element providing this permission is
   <provide-user-input>, and it is an enumerated integer type.  Its
   value defines what information is provided to watchers:

   false: This value indicates that the <user-input> element is removed
      from the document.  It is assigned the numeric value of 0.

   bare: This value indicates that the <user-input> element is to be
      retained.  However, any "idle-threshold" and "since" attributes
      are to be removed.  This value is assigned the numeric value of 1.

   thresholds: This value indicates that the <user-input> element is to
      be retained.  However, only the "idle-threshold" attribute is to
      be retained.  This value is assigned to the numeric value of 2.

   full: This value indicates that the <user-input> element is to be
      retained, including any attributes.  This value is assigned to the
      numeric value of 3.


3.3.2.13  Provide Note

   This permission controls access to the <note> element defined in [3]
   for <tuple> and [15] for <person> and <device>.  The name of the
   element providing this permission is <provide-note>, and it is a
   boolean type.  If its value is TRUE, then the <note> elements in the
   person, service or device data elements are reported to the watcher.
   If FALSE, this presence attribute is removed if present.

3.3.2.14  Provide Unknown Attribute

   It is important that systems be allowed to include proprietary or new
   presence information, and that users be able to set permissions for
   that information, without requiring an upgrade of the presence server
   and authorization system.  For this reason, the <provide-unknown-
   attribute> permission is defined.  This permission indicates that the
   unknown presence attribute with the given name (supplied as mandatory
   attribute of the <provide-unknown-attribute> element) should be
   included in the document.  Its type is boolean.

   The value of the name attribute MUST be a qualified element name
   (meaning that the namespace prefix MUST be included), which will be
   matched to all unknown child elements of the PIDF <tuple>, <device>
   or <person< elements with the same qualified name.  The namespace
   bindings are taken from those in scope at the point in the document
   where the <provide-unknown-attribute> is present.  In this context,
   "unknown" means that the presence server is not aware of any schemas
   that define authorization policies for that element.  By definition,
   this will exclude the <provide-unknown-attribute> rule from being
   applied to any of the presence status extensions defined by RPID.

   Another consequence of this definition is that the interpretation of
   the <provide-unknown-attribute> element can change should the
   presence server be upgraded with a new schema that defines
   authorization rules for elements included in a <provide-unknown-
   attribute>.  The <provide-unknown-attribute> permissions for those
   elements will then be ignored, resulting in a removal of those
   elements from presence documents sent to watchers.  The system
   remains privacy safe, but behavior might not be as expected.
   Developers of systems which allow clients to set policies are advised
   to check the capabilities of the server, as defined in [21], before
   uploading a new authorization document, to make sure that the
   behavior will be as expected.

3.3.2.15  Provide All Attributes

   This permission grants access to all presence attributes in all of
   the person, device and tuple elements that are present in the
   document (the ones present in the document are determedined by the
   <provide-persons>, <provide-devices> and <provide-services>
   permissions).  It is effectively a macro that expands into a set of
   provide-activities, provide-class, provide-device-id, provide-mood,
   provide-place-is, provide-place-type, provide-privacy, provide-
   relationship, provide-sphere, provide-status-icon, provide-time-
   offset, provide-user-input, provide-note and provide-unknown-
   attribute permissions such that each presence attribute in the
   document has a permission for it.  This implies that, so long as an
   entire person, service or device occurrence is provided, every single
   presence attribute, including ones not known to the server and/or
   defined in future presence document extensions, is granted to the
   watcher.

4.  When to Apply the Authorization Policies

   This specification does not mandate at what point in the processing
   of presence data the privacy filtering aspects of the authorization
   policy are applied.  However, they must be applied such that the
   final presence document sent to the watcher is compliant to the
   privacy policy described in the document.  More concretely, if the
   document sent to a watcher is D, and the privacy filtering operation
   applied do a presence document x is F(x), then D MUST have the
   property that D = F(D).  A corollary of this is that F(F(D)) = D for
   all D.

   The subscription processing aspects of the document get applied by
   the server when it decides to accept or reject the subscription.

5.  Example Document

   The following presence authorization document specifies permissions
   for the user "user@example.com".

7.  Schema Extensibility

   It is anticipated that future changes to this specification are
   accomplished through extensions that define new types of permissions.
   These extensions MUST exist within a different namespace.
   Furthermore, the schema defined above and the namespace for elements
   defined within it MUST NOT be altered by future specifications.
   Changes in the basic schema, or in the interpretation of elements
   within that schema, may result in violations of user privacy due to
   mis-interpretation of documents.

   This specification also defines two substitution groups.  One is for
   service identifiers, and one is for device identifiers.  It is
   expected that future extensions will specify new ways of identifying
   services and devices for inclusion in a document.  These new
   permissions MUST be assigned to this substitution group.

8.  XCAP Usage

   The following section defines the details necessary for clients to
   manipulate presence authorization documents from a server using XCAP.

8.1  Application Unique ID

   XCAP requires application usages to define a unique application usage
   ID (AUID) in either the IETF tree or a vendor tree.  This
   specification defines the "pres-rules" AUID within the IETF tree, via
   the IANA registration in Section 10.

8.2  Structure of Permission Statements

   The structure of permission statements is defined in Section 3.

8.3  Additional Constraints

   There are no additional constraints defined by this specification.

8.4  Naming Conventions

   When a presence agent receives a subscription for some user foo
   within a domain, it will look for all documents within http://[xcap
   root]/ pres-rules/users/foo, and use all documents found beneath that
   point to guide authorization policy.

8.5  Authorization Policies

   This application usage does not modify the default XCAP authorization
   policy, which is that only a user can read, write or modify their own



Rosenberg               Expires January 19, 2006               [Page 20]

Internet-Draft           Presence Authorization                July 2005


   documents.  A server can allow priveleged users to modify documents
   that they don't own, but the establishment and indication of such
   policies is outside the scope of this document.

8.6  XML Schema

   The XML schema is defined in Section 6.

9.  Security Considerations

   Presence authorization policies contain very sensitive information.
   They indicate which other users are "liked" or "disliked" by a user.
   As such, when these documents are transported over a network, they
   SHOULD be encrypted.

   Modification of these documents by an attacker can disrupt the
   service seen by a user, often in subtle ways.  As a result, when
   these documents are transported, the transport SHOULD provide
   authenticity and message integrity.

   In the case where XCAP is used to transfer the document, clients
   SHOULD use HTTP over TLS, and servers SHOULD define the root services
   URI as an https URI.  The server SHOULD authenticate the client over
   the resulting TLS connection using HTTP digest.

10.  IANA Considerations

   There are several IANA considerations associated with this
   specification.

10.1  XCAP Application Usage ID

   This section registers an XCAP Application Usage ID (AUID) according
   to the IANA procedures defined in [2].

      Name of the AUID: pres-rules

      Description: Presence rules are documents that describe the
      permissions that a presentity [19] has granted to users that seek
      to watch their presence.


10.2  URN Sub-Namespace Registration

   This section registers a new XML namespace, per the guidelines in
   [16]
