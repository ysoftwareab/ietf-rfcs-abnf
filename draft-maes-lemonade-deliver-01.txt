Abstract 
    
   This draft introduces LDELIVER and LCOMPOSE as a LEMONADE extensions 
   to the IMAPv4 Rev1 protocol [RFC3501] to enable sending email as an 
   IMAP command. It provides simple ways to provide reply and forward 
   without download with a gateway to the email and submit servers as 
   well we as support to send only edit differences to the server. It is 
   complementary to the trio BURL/URLAUTH/CATENATE described in 
   [LEMONADEPROFILE].

1.    Introduction 
    
   LDELIVER defines extensions to the IMAPv4 Rev1 protocol [RFC3501] to 
   enable the efficient composition and transmission of email using IMAP 
   commands. This provides simple ways to provide reply and forward 
   without download complete messages utilizing a gateway to the email 
   and submit servers. 
    
   LDELIVER is not intended to replace SMTP [RFC2821]. Instead it is 
   envisaged as a simple way to implement gateways that support features 
   like reply and forward without downloading complete messages when the 
   email and submit servers may not support the commands described in 
   [LEMONADEPROFILE] to support such capabilities. 
    
   LDELIVER may allow some clients to reduce the amount of protocols 
   supported ports in use, parameters to set or provisioned, or network 
   protocols required. 
    
   All these are important features required in particular to support 
   mobile email use cases [MEMAIL][OMA-ME-RD]: 
   - Forward and reply without download 
   - Ease of provisioning over the air 
   - Ease of manual provisioning 
   - Reduction of resources on the client 
   - Ease of implementation and deployment with existing email and 
     submit servers 
 
    
2.   Relation with other E-mail specifications 
    
   LDELIVER can be seen as a command that allows optimization of IMAP 
   for mobile clients.  
    
   The Lemonade Profile [LEMONADEPROFILE] specifies the Lemonade Pull 
   Model that governs the exchanges among mail servers or between 
   desktop mail client and mail servers. Lemonade investigates adding 
   mobile optimizations for the next version of the profile. 
    
   LDELIVER should be seen as a way to address the issues of mobile 
   optimization and an input to the Lemonade Profile work as an 
   alternative suitable for fast support of forward, reply and edit 
   without download.  
    
   Clients and servers MAY support other Lemonade extensions and 
   behaviors. 
    
   This document assumes that clients MUST be compliant to LDELIVER, if 
   they decide to use LDELIVER. The server that advertises support for

   LDELIVER via CAPABILITY MUST be compliant to LDELIVER for its 
   exchanges with the mobile client.  
    
3.   Interactions between the Client and Server when supporting LDELIVER 
    
   A compliant server must support all IMAPv4Rev1 commands from client 
   devices following the syntax defined in [RFC3501].  Thus, a client 
   may issue any existing IMAP commands to the server, and both the 
   server and client must behave as specified in [RFC3501].   
    
    
4.   The CAPABILITY Command 
    
   The CAPABILITY command is defined in [RFC3501], section 6.1.1.  The 
   client sends a CAPABILITY command so it can query the server to find 
   out what commands it supports.  In [RFC3501], the IMAP server is 
   allowed to specify additional capabilities not included in that 
   specification.  A server that supports LDELIVER conforms to that 
   requirement, and MUST list that it supports LDELIVER.   
    
   A server can also enumerate individually the other commands that it 
   supports.  
    
    
   capability_cmd =  tag SP "CAPABILITY"  
   Valid States:  NOT AUTHENTICATED, AUTHENTICATED, SELECTED, or LOGOUT 
   Responses:  REQUIRED untagged response: CAPABILITY 
   Result:  OK - capability completed 
      BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid 
    
   Example: A server that implements LDELIVER.  
      C: a001 CAPABILITY 
      S: * CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1 AUTH=LOGIN IDLE LDELIVER 
      S: a001 OK CAPABILITY completed 
    
5.   Specification details 
 
   The LDELIVER specification proposes two commands. LCOMPOSE which 
   allows messages to be created on the server for later transmission 
   and LDELIVER which allows the previous composed messages to be 
   transmitted via SMTP. It also introduces two new types of message 
   literals, the substituted literal and the delta literal. 
    
5.1.     the LCOMPOSE command 
    
   The LCOMPOSE command is an extension to the IMAP APPEND command and 
   builds on CATENATE which may be used to compose new messages which 
   include parts of other messages that already exist on the server, 
   and/or edit those parts. It also includes a short-cut syntax to

   handle the two most common use cases: replying and forwarding 
   messages that contain the original attachments. 
    
   The inclusion of other data is handled by the CATENATE URL command 
   and a new literal DTEXT, the delta literal allows parts of other 
   messages to be included and ôpatchedö via a delta encoded literal. 
    
   Servers which support LCOMPOSE MUST support the LITERAL+ extension 
   [RFC2088]  
    
    
5.1.1. Formal Syntax 
    
   append-data =/ ôLCOMPOSEö "(" compose-part *(SP compose-part) ")" 
   compose-part = text-literal / dtext-literal 
   text-literal = "TEXT" SP literal 
   dtext-literal = ôDTEXTö SP astring SP literal 
    
   The astring in dtext-literal represents an IMAPURL pointing to an 
   existing message part to be included and ôpatchedö by the delta 
   encoded literal. The chosen delta encoding is the well known UNIX 
   ôdiff ûeö format. 
    
   The text-literal functions as described in [CATENATE], except that 
   LITERAL+ support is mandated. 
    
    
5.1.2. Examples 
 
   Append a new message in the Drafts folder using 2 literals, one a 
   substituted literal which includes two pieces of data from a message  
   UID=4321 and the second literal simply providing the ending MIME 
   boundary.

5.2.     IMAPURL extensions 
 
   IMAPURL is hereby modified to support a special section attribute 
   value ô(F)REATTACHö. ôSection=(F)REATTACHö wgucg consists of all 
   multipart/mixed body parts of the original MIME message except for 
   the first text body part. This is used when one wants to include all 
   attachments in a reply/forward, except for the original text. 
   FREATTACH includes even the first text body part. 
 
 
5.3 The LDELIVER command 
     
   After a message has been composed, it can be handed off to a submit 
   server. The mechanism by which it does this is by proxying a batched 
   set of SMTP commands to an SMTP server. LDELIVER is not an active 
   SMTP tunnel, but instead works similarly to [RFC2442] Batch SMTP, by

   allowing the client to compose a set of SMTP commands to be executed. 
   The major difference is that those commands are not delivered via a 
   special MIME message, but rather LDELIVER is the batch SMTP 
   processor. Moreover, since LDELIVER exposes SMTP extensions that are 
   available, the client need not make any assumptions about which SMTP 
   extensions are available. 
    
   Finally, LDELIVER reuses the LCOMPOSE TEXT and DTEXT literals when 
   building the batch in order to allow inclusion of pre-composed 
   messages or editing of envelope parameters. 
 
5.3.2 Formal Syntax 
 
   ldeliver-cmd = ôLDELIVERö SP (ôCAPABILITYö / text-literal / dtext-
   literal) 
 
5.3.2 Examples 
 
   The following example will pick up the message that was composed in 
   the LCOMPOSE chapter and send it via SMTP 
    
   Example: 
    
   C: a004 LDELIVER CAPABILITY 
   S: * LDELIVER CAPABILITY (ô8BITMIMEö ôEXPNö ôHELPö) 
   C: a005 LDELIVER TEXT {123+} 
   C: EHLO 
   C: MAIL FROM: john@smith.com 
   C: RCPT TO: mooch@owatagu.siam.edu 
   C: DATA 
   C: URL ô/Inbox;UIDVALIDITY=9999/;UID=33;Section=BODYö 
   . 
   S: * LDELIVER SMTP-RESPONSE {321} 
   S: 220 mail.metastructure.net ESMTP 
   S: 250-mail.metastructure.net

6.   Note on LDELIVER, SMTP and Lemonade Profile 
    
   A server MAY always rather support SMTP instead of LDELIVER. A client 
   MAY then select to rely on SMTP instead of LDELIVER. This of course 
   may reduce the forward / reply without download capabilities that may 
   be available.

                              <LDELIVER>                September 2005 
 
 
   A server MAY also advertise via capability support for Lemonade 
   Profile [LEMONADEPROFILE] or the subset of commands (see 
   [LEMONADEPROFILE] needed to support forward without download. In such 
   case, the client MAY rely on the Lemonade profile forward without 
   download mechanisms. 
    
   In general, because of mobile device resource constraints, and 
   corporate firewall and security policies, LDELIVER is easier to 
   deploy for mobile devices, than exposing and restricting SMTP 
   services to mobile devices, especially those devices without VPN 
   functionality. 
 
Security Considerations 
    
   The protocol calls for the same security requirements as IMAP and 
   [LEMONADEPROFILE].   
 
   It is also recommended that clients be explicitly registered with the 
   server through separate channels / application. Exchanges should then 
   be paired, encrypted and signed as deemed appropriate by the user and 
   administrators. 
    
   When an implementation is based on gateways, this may create new 
   security issues.   
    
   In some implementations, the client may connect to a proxy that sits 
   in an operator network, but the backend email storage server sits in 
   a separate enterprise network.  The enterprise network is assumed to 
   be secure, but the operator network may not be trusted.  If 
   unencrypted information lies in the operator network, that 
   information is vulnerable to attacks. 
    
   If the LDELIVER server is implemented in the enterprise network, then 
   the proxy on the carrier should be an encrypted SSL pass-through 
   proxy.  The proxy is unaware of the encryption keys and thus cannot 
   encrypt any data.  Without the encryption key, this proxy cannot see 
   any of the information sent from the client, nor can it send any 
   bogus commands to the backend enterprise email server to corrupt the 
   user's mailbox.  The additional cost for this design is that the 
   backend enterprise email server and the client devices must have 
   additional processing to handle this encryption. 
    
   If the LDELIVER server is implemented as a backend IMAP server with 
   additional command processing done on it, there are more complex 
   security issues.  This proxy must be able to send commands to the 
   backend server to accomplish its tasks, as well as read information 
   coming from the backend server.  An attacker thus can send commands 
   to the backend.    This proxy may also send bogus responses back to 
   the client.  Clearly, this setup is not an ideal issue and many

   complications that make this problem complex to solve.  The 
   suggestion recommended is to rely on encrypted messages to be 
   decrypted at the backend submit server before being sent by it. The 
   key exchange for encryption should not occur through the proxy.  It 
   has to be done through another channel: manually entered by user 
   (e.g. password), or via an HTTP SSL request to the enterprise server.
