1  Abstract 
    
   This draft describes service requirements related to emulating a 
   virtual private LAN over an IP or MPLS network infrastructure. The 
   service is called VPLS. It is a class of Provider Provisioned 
   Virtual Private Network [2]. The general requirements can be found 
   in [3].

   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [4]. 
    

3  Definitions 

3.1 VPLS 
    
   Virtual Private LAN Service, a case of L2VPN service distinguished 
   by the support of L2 broadcast.  The term is also used, when clear 
   from the context, to refer to a particular instance of VPLS service. 
    
   A VPLS service allows the connection of multiple sites in a single 
   broadcast domain over a provider managed IP or MPLS network. All 
   customer sites in the VPLS appear to be on the same LAN regardless 
   of their location. 
    

3.2 VPLS Domain 
    
   A Layer 2 VPN that is composed of a community of interest of L2 MAC 
   addresses and VLANs. Each VPLS Domain MAY have multiple VLANs in it. 
    

3.3 VLAN 
    
   A customer VLAN identification using some scheme such as IEEE 802.1Q 
   tags, port configuration or any other means. A VPLS service can be 
   extended to recognize customer VLANs as specified in 6.1 . 
    

3.4 VLAN Flooding Scope (VLAN Broadcast Domain) 
    
   The scope of flooding for a given VLAN. In a VPLS service, a VLAN 
   flooding scope is identical to the flooding scope of the VPLS it is 
   part of. If a VPLS service is extended to recognize customer VLANs, 
   the VLAN flooding scope is limited to the broadcast domain of each 
   recognized VLAN.

3.5 VSI 
    
   Virtual Switching Instance. A virtual layer 2 forwarding entity that 
   is closed to a VPLS domain membership. VSI forwarding can be based 
   on MAC addresses, VLAN tags, policies, topologies, filters, QoS 
   parameters, and other relevant information on a per VPLS basis. 
    

4  Introduction 
    
   Traditionally, the typical connectivity between a service provider 
   and a customer is a WAN link with some type of a point-to-point 
   protocol. This arrangement was borne out of the necessity to 
   traverse TDM circuits originally designed for voice traffic. The 
   introduction of WAN links to network architectures significantly 
   increased the complexity of network topologies and required highly 
   skilled personnel to manage and maintain the network. 
    
   One solution to the above has been for service providers to deploy 
   emulated LAN services known in this context as "Transparent LAN" 
   services. These have typically been offered using a mesh of ATM PVCs 
   between locations.  While this technique reduced complexity for the 
   customer, it proved inadequate in the area of scaling and ease of 
   management on the provider side. 
    
   The aim of this effort is to develop a Virtual Private LAN Service, 
   VPLS, that scales well, is simple to manage, and is based on the 
   existing MPLS or IP backbone. 
    
   VPLS emulates a flat LAN with learning and switching capabilities. 
   In a given LAN, there is a reasonably small set of MAC devices with 
   a limited number of MAC addresses to learn and manage. There is no 
   need for additional routing protocol support between the CE and the 
   PE devices.  In the VPLS model, the service is transparent to the 
   customer's choice of routing protocol. Moreover, VPLS services also 
   benefit from being transparent to higher layer protocols, so the 
   same technology can transport, for example, IPv4, IPv6, MPLS as well 
   as legacy protocols such as IPX and OSI. 
    
   The VPLS model, while offering significant benefits for both 
   customers and service providers, retains all the quintessential 
   characteristics of L2 networks including their well known 
   limitations e.g. the maximum practical number of hosts on a single 
   LAN, etc.  A likely application of this model is to connect a few 
   sites with only a single customer router at each site, or a small 
   number of customer hosts, at each site, connected via the VPLS. 
    
   The scope of this document will be limited to supporting Ethernet as 
   the access framing technology for VPLS implementation.

5  VPLS Reference Model 
    
   The following diagram shows a VPLS reference model where PE devices 
   that are VPLS-capable provide a logical interconnect such that CE 
   devices belonging to a specific VPLS appear to be connected by a 
   single logical Ethernet bridge. A VPLS can contain a single VLAN or 
   multiple, tagged VLANs.

   Separate L2 broadcast domains are maintained on a per VPLS basis by 
   PE devices. Such domains are then mapped onto tunnels in the service 
   provider network. These tunnels can either be specific to a VPLS 
   (e.g. as with IP) or shared among several VPLSs (e.g. as with MPLS 
   tunnel LSPs). In the above diagram, the top PE routers maintain 
   separate forwarding instances for VPLS A and VPLS B. 
    
   The CE-to-PE links can either be direct physical links, e.g. 
   100BaseTX, or logical links, e.g. ATM PVC, T1/E1 TDM, or RFC1490-
   encapsulated links, over which bridged Ethernet traffic is carried. 
    
   The PE-to-PE links carry tunneled Ethernet frames using different 
   tunneling technologies (e.g., GRE, IPSec, MPLS, L2TP, etc.). 
        
   Each PE device learns remote MAC addresses, and is responsible for 
   proper forwarding of the customer traffic to the appropriate end 
   nodes. It is responsible for guaranteeing each VPLS topology is loop 
   free.

6  VPLS General Requirements 

6.1 Layer 2 Domain representation 
    
   A VPLS system MUST distinguish different customer domains. Each of 
   these customer domains MUST appear as a L2 broadcast domain network 
   behaving like a LAN (Local Area Network). These domains are referred 
   to as VPLS domains.  
    
   A VPLS MAY span multiple service providers. Each VPLS MUST carry a 
   unique identification within a VPLS system. It is RECOMMENDED that 
   VPLS identification be globally unique. 
    
   Each VPLS domain MUST be capable of learning and forwarding based on 
   MAC addresses thus emulating an Ethernet virtual switch to the 
   customer CE devices attached to PEs. 
    
   A VPLS system MAY recognize customer VLAN identification. In that 
   case, a VLAN MUST be recognized in the context of the VPLS it is 
   part of.  If customer VLANs are recognized, separate VLAN broadcast 
   domains SHOULD be maintained. 
    
   A provider's implementation of a VPLS system SHOULD NOT constrain 
   the customer's ability to configure LAN topologies, tags, 802.1 p-
   bits, or any other Layer 2 parameters. 
    

6.2 VPLS Topology 
    
   The VPLS system MAY be realized using one or more network tunnel 
   topologies to interconnect PEs, ranging  from simple point-to-point 
   to distributed hierarchical arrangements. The typical topologies 
   include: 
    
     o point-to-point 
     o point-to-multipoint, a.k.a. hub and spoke 
     o any-to-any, a.k.a. full mesh 
     o mixed, a.k.a. partial mesh 
     o hierarchical 
    
   Regardless of the topology employed, the service to the customers 
   MUST retain the typical LAN any-to-any connectivity.  This 
   requirement does not imply that all traffic characteristics (such as 
   bandwidth, QoS, delay, etc.) be necessarily the same between any two 
   end points. 
    

6.3 Redundancy and Failure Recovery 
        
   The VPLS infrastructure SHOULD provide redundant paths to assure 
   high availability.  The reaction to failures SHOULD result in an 
   attempt to restore the service using alternative paths.   
  
Augustyn, et al.          Expires April 2003                         5 
 
              draft-ietf-ppvpn-vpls-requirements-01.txt  October 2002 
                                
    
   The intention is to keep the restoration time small. It is 
   RECOMMENDED that the restoration time be less than the time it takes 
   the CE devices, or customer L2 control protocols, to detect a 
   failure in the VPLS. 
    
   In cases where the provider knows a priori about impending changes 
   in network topology, the network SHOULD have the capability to 
   reconfigure without a loss, duplication, or re-ordering of customer 
   packets.  This situation typically arises with planned network 
   upgrades or scheduled maintenance activities. 
    

6.4 Policy Constraints 
    
   A VPLS system MAY employ policy constraints governing various 
   interconnection attributes for VPLS domains. Typical attributes 
   include: 
    
     o Selection of available network infrastructure 
     o QoS services needed 
     o Protection services needed 
     o Availability of higher level service access points (see 9.7 ) 
         
   Policy attributes SHOULD be advertised via the VPLS system's control 
   plane. 
    

6.5 PE nodes 
    
   The PE nodes are the devices in the VPLS system that store 
   information related to customer VPLS domains and employ methods to 
   forward customer traffic based on that information. In this 
   document, the PE nodes are meant in logical sense.  In the actual 
   implementations, the PE nodes may be comprised of several physical 
   devices. Conversely, a single physical device may contain more than 
   one PE node. 
    
   All forwarding decisions related to customer VPLS traffic MUST be 
   made by PE nodes.  This requirement prohibits any other network 
   components from altering decisions made by PE nodes. 
    

6.6 PE-PE Interconnection and Tunneling 
    
   A VPLS system MUST provide for connectivity between each pair of PE 
   nodes.  The connectivity is referred to as transport tunneling or 
   simply tunneling. 
    
   There are several choices for implementing transport tunnels. Some 
   popular choices include MPLS, IP in IP tunnels, variations of

              draft-ietf-ppvpn-vpls-requirements-01.txt  October 2002 
                                
   802.1Q, etc.  Regardless of the choice, the existence of the tunnels 
   and their operations MUST be transparent to the customers. 
    

6.7 PE-CE Interconnection and Profiles 
    
   A VPLS system MUST provide for connectivity between PE nodes and CE 
   nodes.  That connectivity is referred to as an Attachment Circuit 
   (AC). Attachment Circuits MAY span networks of other providers or 
   public networks. 
    
   There are several choices for implementing ACs. Some popular choices 
   include Ethernet, ATM (DSL), Frame Relay, MPLS-based virtual 
   circuits etc. Regardless of the choice, the ACs MUST use Ethernet 
   frames as the Service Protocol Data Unit (SPDU). 
    
   A CE access connection over an AC MUST be bi-directional in nature. 
    
   PE devices MAY support multiple ACs on a single physical interface. 
   In such cases, PE devices MUST NOT rely on customer controlled 
   parameters for distinguishing between different access connections.  
   For example, if VLAN tags were used for that purpose, the provider 
   would be controlling the assignment of the tag values and would 
   strictly enforce compliance by the CEs. 
    
   An AC connection, whether direct or virtual, MUST maintain all 
   committed characteristics of the customer traffic, such as QoS, 
   priorities etc. The characteristics of an AC connection are only 
   applicable to that connection.  
    

7  Control Plane Requirements 

7.1 Provider Edge Signaling 
    
   The control protocols SHOULD provide methods for signaling between 
   PEs. The signaling SHOULD inform of membership, tunneling 
   information, and other relevant parameters. 
    
   The infrastructure MAY employ manual configuration methods to 
   provide this type of information. 
    
   The infrastructure SHOULD use policies to scope the membership and 
   reachability advertisements for a particular VPLS. 
    

7.2 VPLS Membership Discovery 
    
   The control plane and/or the management plane SHOULD provide methods 
   to discover the PEs which connect CEs forming a VPLS.

7.3 Support for Layer 2 control protocols 
    
   The VPLS system's control protocols SHOULD allow transparent 
   operation of Layer 2 control protocols employed by customers. 
    
   A VPLS system MUST ensure that loops be prevented. This can be 
   accomplished through a loop free topologies or appropriate 
   forwarding rules.  Control protocols such as Spanning Tree (STP) or 
   similar could be employed.  The system's control protocols MAY use 
   indications from customer control protocols, e.g. STP, to improve 
   the operation of a VPLS. 
    

7.4 Scaling Requirements 
    
   In a VPLS system, the control plane traffic increases with the 
   growth of VPLS membership. Similarly, the control plane traffic 
   increases with the number of supported VPLS domains.  The rate of 
   growth of the associated control plane traffic SHOULD be linear. 
    
   The use of control plane resources increases with the number of 
   hosts connected to a VPLS. The rate of growth of the demand for 
   control process resources SHOULD be linear.  The control plane MAY 
   offer means for enforcing a limit on the number of customer hosts 
   attached to a VPLS. 
    

8  Data Plane Requirements 

8.1 Transparency 
    
   VPLS service is intended to be transparent to Layer 2 customer 
   networks.  It SHOULD NOT require any special packet processing by 
   the end users before sending packets to the provider's network. 
    

8.2 QoS and packet re-ordering 
    
   A VPLS system SHOULD have capabilities to enforce QoS parameters.  
    
   The queuing and forwarding policies SHOULD preserve packet order for 
   packets with the same QoS parameters. 
    
   The service SHOULD not duplicate packets. 
    

8.3 Broadcast Domain 
    
   The Broadcast Domain is defined as the flooding scope of a Layer 2 
   network. A separate Broadcast Domain MUST be maintained for each 
   VPLS.  
  
Augustyn, et al.          Expires April 2003                         8 
 
              draft-ietf-ppvpn-vpls-requirements-01.txt  October 2002 
                                
    
   In addition to VPLS Broadcast Domains, a VPLS system MAY recognize 
   customer VLAN Broadcast Domains. In that case, the system SHOULD 
   maintain a separate VLAN Broadcast Domain for each customer VLAN.  A 
   VLAN Broadcast Domain MUST be a subset of the owning VPLS Broadcast 
   Domain. 
    

8.4 MAC address learning 
    
   A VPLS service SHOULD derive all topology and forwarding information 
   from packets originating at customer sites.  Typically, MAC 
   addresses learning mechanisms are used for this purpose. 
    
   In a VPLS system, MAC address learning MUST take place on a per 
   Virtual Switching Instance (VSI) basis, i.e. in the context of a 
   VPLS and, if supported, in the context of VLANs therein. 
    

8.5 Unicast, Unknown Unicast, Multicast, and Broadcast forwarding 
    
   VPLS MUST be aware of the existence and the designated roles of 
   special MAC addresses such as Multicast and Broadcast addresses. 
   VPLS MUST forward these packets according to their intended 
   functional meaning and scope. 
    
   Broadcast packets MUST be flooded to all destinations. 
    
   Multicast packets MUST be flooded to all destinations. However, a 
   VPLS system MAY employ multicast snooping techniques, in which case 
   multicast packets SHOULD be forwarded only to their intended 
   destinations. 
    
   Unicast packets MUST be forwarded to their intended destinations. 
    
   Unknown Unicast packets MUST be flooded to all destinations in the 
   flooding scope of the VPLS (or VLAN). If the VPLS service relies on 
   MAC learning for its operations, it MUST assure proper forwarding of 
   packets with MAC addresses that have not been learned.  Once 
   destination MAC addresses are learned, unicast packets SHOULD be 
   forwarded only to their intended destinations. 
    
   A provider MAY employ a method to limit the scope of flooding of 
   Unknown Unicast packets in cases where a customer desires to 
   conserve its bandwidth or wants to implement certain security 
   policies. 
    

8.6 Virtual Switching Instance 
    
   VPLS Provider Edge devices MUST maintain a separate Virtual 
   Switching Instance (VSI) per each VPN. Each VSI MUST have

   capabilities to forward traffic based on customer's traffic 
   parameters such as MAC addresses, VLAN tags (if supported), etc. as 
   well as local policies. 
    
   VPLS Provider Edge devices MUST have capabilities to classify 
   incoming customer traffic into the appropriate VSI. 
    
   Each VSI MUST have flooding capabilities for its Broadcast Domain to 
   facilitate proper forwarding of Broadcast, Multicast and Unknown 
   Unicast customer traffic. 
    

8.7 Minimum MTU 
    
   The VPLS service MUST support customer frames with payload 1500 
   bytes long.  The service MAY offer support for longer frames. 
    
   The service MUST NOT fragment packets.  Packets exceeding committed 
   MTU size MUST be discarded. 
    
   The committed minimum MTU size MUST be the same for a given instance 
   of VPLS. Different VPLS instances MAY have different committed MTU 
   sizes. If VLANs are supported, all VLANs within a given VPLS MUST 
   inherit the same MTU size.   
    

8.8 Multilink Access 
    
   The VPLS service SHOULD support multilink access for CE devices. 
   The VPLS service MAY support multihome access for CE devices. 
    

8.9 End-point VLAN tag translation 
    
   If VLANs are recognized, the VPLS system MAY support translation of 
   customers' VLAN tags. Such service simplifies connectivity of sites 
   that want to keep their tag assignments or sites that belong to 
   different administrative entities.  In the latter case, the 
   connectivity is sometimes referred to as L2 extranet. 
    

8.10 Support for MAC Services 
    
   VPLS are REQUIRED to provide MAC service compliant with IEEE 802.1D 
   specification [5] Section 6. Compliance with this section 
   facilitates proper operation of 802.1 LAN and seamless integration 
   of VPLS with bridged Local Area Networks.  It is also useful to 
   compare [6], [7], and [8]. 
 
   A MAC service in the context of VPLS is defined as the transfer of 
   user data between source and destination end stations via the 
   service access points using the information specified in the VSI.

   1. A PE device that provides VPLS MUST NOT be directly accessed by 
      end stations except for explicit management purposes. 
    
   2. All MAC addresses MUST be unique within a given broadcast domain. 
    
   3. The topology and configuration of the VPLS MUST NOT restrict the 
      MAC addresses of end stations 
    

9  Management and Operations Requirements 

9.1 VPLS configuration and monitoring 
    
   A VPLS system MUST have capabilities to configure, manage, and 
   monitor its different components. 
    
   It SHOULD be possible to create several disjoint instances of VPLS 
   systems within the same underlying network infrastructures. 
        
   The infrastructure SHOULD monitor all characteristics of the service 
   that are reflected in the customer SLA. This includes but is not 
   limited to bandwidth usage, packet counts, packet drops, service 
   outages, etc. 
    

9.2 VPLS operations 
    
   The operations of a VPLS systems is controlled by an Administrative 
   Authority (Admin).  The Admin is the originator of all operational 
   parameters of a VPLS system. Conversely, the admin is also the 
   ultimate destination for the status of the VPLS system and the 
   related statistical information.  A typical VPLS system spans 
   several such Admins. 
    
   A VPLS system MUST support proper dissemination of operational 
   parameters to all elements of a VPLS system in the presence of 
   multiple Admins. 
    
   A VPLS system MUST employ mechanisms for sharing operational 
   parameters between different Admins.  These mechanism MUST NOT 
   assume any particular structure of the different Admins.  For 
   example the VPLS should not be relying on Admins forming a 
   hierarchy. 
    
   A VPLS system SHOULD support policies for proper selection of 
   operational parameters coming from different Admins. Similarly, a 
   VPLS system SHOULD support policies for selecting information to be 
   disseminated to different Admins. 
    
   A VPLS system SHOULD employ discovery mechanisms to minimize the 
   amount of operational information maintained by the Admins.  For

              draft-ietf-ppvpn-vpls-requirements-01.txt  October 2002 
                                
   example, if an admin adds or removes a customer port on a given PE, 
   the remaining PEs should determine the necessary actions to take 
   without the Admins having to explicitly reconfigure those PEs. 
    

9.3 CE Provisioning 
    
   The VPLS MUST require only minimal or no configuration on the CE 
   devices, depending on the CE device that connects into the 
   infrastructure. 
    

9.4 Customer traffic policing 
    
   The VPLS service SHOULD provide the ability to police and/or shape 
   customer traffic entering and leaving the VPLS system. 
    

9.5 Dynamic Service Signaling  
        
   A Provider MAY offer to customers an in-band method for selecting 
   services from the list specified in the SLA. A Provider MAY use the 
   same mechanism for reporting statistical data related to the 
   service. 
    

9.6 Class of Service Model  
    
   The VPLS service MAY define a graded selection of classes of 
   traffic.  These include, but are not limited to 
        
     o range of priorities  
     o best effort vs. guaranteed effort  
     o range of minimum delay characteristics  
    

9.7 VPLS service access option. 
        
   The VPLS service SHOULD allow for a Provider based Service Access 
   for orderly injection of L3 or higher services to the customers' 
   VPLS networks. 
    
   In particular, the system SHOULD allow to build L3VPN services, 
   including L3 interworking schemes such as ARP mediation or similar. 
        
   As a value added service, a Provider MAY offer access to other 
   services such as, IP gateways, storage networks, content delivery 
   etc.

9.8 Testing 
    
   The VPLS service SHOULD provide the ability to test and verify 
   operational and maintenance activities on a per VPLS basis and, if 
   supported, on a per VLAN basis. 
    

9.9 Learning information from customer devices 
    
   The VPLS service SHOULD provide means for limiting the amount of 
   information learned from customer devices. For example, VPLS 
   implementations may limit the number of MAC addresses learned from 
   the customers' devices. 
    

10 Security Requirements 

10.1 Traffic separation 
    
   A VPLS system MUST provide traffic separation between different VPLS 
   domains. If VLANs are supported, the system MUST provide traffic 
   separation between customer VLANs within each VPLS domain. 
    

10.2 Provider network protection. 
    
   A VPLS system MUST be immune to malformed or maliciously constructed 
   customer traffic. This includes but is not limited to duplicate or 
   invalid L2 addresses, customer side loops, short/long packets, 
   spoofed management packets, spoofed VLAN tags, etc. 
    
   The VPLS infrastructure devices MUST NOT be accessible from the 
   VPLS. 
    

10.3 Value added security services 
    
   Value added security services such as encryption and/or 
   authentication of customer packets, certificate management, and 
   similar are OPTIONAL. 
    
   Security measures employed by the VPLS system SHOULD NOT restrict 
   implementation of customer based security add-ons.
