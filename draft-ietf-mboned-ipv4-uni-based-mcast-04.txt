Abstract

   This specification defines an extension to the multicast addressing
   architecture of the IP Version 4 protocol.  The extension presented
   in this document allows for unicast-prefix-based allocation of
   multicast addresses.  By delegating multicast addresses at the same
   time as unicast prefixes, network operators will be able to identify
   their multicast addresses without needing to run an inter-domain
   allocation protocol.

1.  Introduction

   RFC 3180 [RFC3180] defined an experimental allocation mechanism
   (called "GLOP") in 233/8 whereby an Autonomous System (AS) number is
   embedded in the middle 16 bits of an IPv4 multicast address,
   resulting in 256 multicast addresses per AS.  Advantages of this
   mechanism include the ability to get multicast address space without
   an inter-domain multicast address allocation protocol, and the ease
   of determining the AS of the owner of an address for debugging and
   auditing purposes.

   Some disadvantages of GLOP include:
   o  RFC 4893 [RFC4893] expands the size of an AS number to 4 bytes,
      and GLOP cannot work with 4-byte AS numbers.
   o  When an AS covers multiple sites or organizations, administration
      of the multicast address space within an AS must be handled by
      other mechanisms, such as manual administrative effort or MADCAP
      [RFC2730].
   o  During debugging, identifying the AS does not immediately identify
      the owning organization when an AS covers multiple organizations.
   o  Only 256 addresses are automatically available per AS, and
      obtaining any more requires administrative effort.

   More recently, a mechanism [RFC3306] has been developed for IPv6 that
   provides a multicast range to every IPv6 subnet, which is at a much
   finer granularity than an AS.  As a result, the first three
   disadvantages above are avoided (and the last disadvantage does not
   apply to IPv6 due to the extended size of the address space).

   Another advantage of providing multicast space to a subnet, rather
   than just to an entire AS, is that multicast address allocation
   within the range need only be coordinated within the subnet.

   This draft specifies a mechanism similar to [RFC3306], whereby a
   range of IPv4 multicast address space is provided to each
   organization that has unicast address space.  A resulting advantage
   over GLOP is that the mechanisms in IPv4 and IPv6 become more
   similar.

   This document proposes an experimental method of statically
   allocating multicast address ranges with global scope.  As described
   in section Section 4, this experiment will last for a period of one
   year, but may be extended.


2.  Address Space

   this note.)

   A multicast address with the prefix TBD/8 indicates that the address
   is a Unicast-Based Multicast (UBM) address.  The remaining 24 bits
   are used as follows:

   Bits:  |  8  | Unicast Prefix Length | 24 - Unicast Prefix Length |
          +-----+-----------------------+----------------------------+
   Value: | TBD | Unicast Prefix        | Group ID                   |
          +-----+-----------------------+----------------------------+

   For organizations with a /24 or shorter prefix, the unicast prefix of
   the organization is appended to the common /8.  Any remaining bits
   may be assigned by any mechanism the organization wishes.  For
   example, an organization that has a subnet with a /24 or shorter
   prefix assigned to a link may wish to embed the entire subnet prefix
   within the multicast address, with the remaining bits assigned by
   hosts within the link (e.g., using manual configuration).
   Organizations with a prefix length longer than 24 do not receive any
   multicast address space from this mechanism; in such cases, another
   mechanism must be used.

   Compared to GLOP, an AS will receive more address space via this
   mechanism if it has more than a /16 for unicast space.  An AS will
   receive less address space than it does from GLOP if it has less than
   a /16.

   The owner of a UBM address can be determined by taking the multicast
   address, shifting it left by 8 bits, and identifying the owner of the
   address space covering the resulting unicast address.


3.  Security Considerations

   The same well known intra-domain security techniques can be applied
   as with GLOP.  Furthermore, when dynamic allocation is used within a
   prefix, the approach described here may have the effect of reduced
   exposure to denial of space attacks, since the topological area
   within which nodes compete for addresses within the same prefix is
   reduced from an entire AS to only within an individual organization
   or an even smaller area.


4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA should assign a /8 in the IPv4 multicast address space for this
   purpose.
