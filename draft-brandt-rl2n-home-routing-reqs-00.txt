   detectors, video surveillance, healthcare systems and advanced remote
   controls.  Because such devices only cover a limited radio range,
   multi-hop routing is often required.  Such devices are usually highly
   constrained in terms of resources such as battery and memory and
   operate in unstable environments.  The aim of this document is to
   specify the routing requirements for networks comprising such
   constrained devices in a home network environment.

1.  Terminology

   L2N: Low power and Lossy Network.

   RL2N: Routing in Low power and Lossy Networks.


2.  Introduction

   This document presents application specific requirements for routing
   in low power and lossy networks (RL2N).  The scope of this document
   is home control and home automation.  In a modern home, a high number
   of wireless devices are used for a wide set of purposes.  Examples
   include lighting control modules, heating control panels, light
   sensors, temperature sensors, gas/water leak detector, motion
   detectors, video surveillance, healthcare systems and advanced remote
   controls.  Basic home control modules such as wall switches and
   plug-in modules may be turned into an advanced home automation
   solution via the use of an IP-enabled application reading wall
   switches, motion sensors, light sensors, rain sensors, and so on.

   Because such devices only cover a limited radio range, multi-hop
   routing is often required.  These devices are usually highly
   constrained in term of resources such as battery and memory and
   operate in unstable environments.  Persons moving around in a house,
   opening or closing a door or starting a vacuum cleaner affect
   reception of weak radio signals.  Reflection and absorption may cause
   a reliable connection to turn unreliable for a period of time and
   then being restored again, thus the term "lossy".

   Section 3 describes common use cases for home automation
   applications.  Section 4 discusses the routing requirements for
   networks comprising such constrained devices in a home network
   environment.  These requirements may be overlapping requirements
   derived from other application-specific requirements documents or as
   listed in [I-D.culler-rsn-routing-reqs].


3.  Home automation applications

   Home automation applications represent a special segment of networked
   wireless devices.  To facilitate the requirements discussion in
   Section 4, this section lists a few typical use cases of home
   automation applications.  New applications are being developed at a
   high pace and this section does not mean to be exhaustive.

3.1.  Turning off the house

   Using the direct analogy to an electronic car key, a house owner may
   stand at the gate and activate the "leaving home" function from his/
   her electronic house key, mobile phone, etc.  For the sake of visual
   impression, all lights should turn off at the same time.  At least,
   it should appear to happen at the same time.  A well-known problem in
   home automation is the "popcorn effect": Lamps are turned on one at a
   time, at a rate so slow that it is clearly visible.  Obviously, this
   mostly apply to very low bandwidth RF systems.  Some existing home
   automation solutions use a clever mix of a "subnet groupcast" message
   with no acknowledgement and no forwarding before sending acknowledged
   singlecast messages to each lighting device.  Broadcast packets
   cannot be used for this since some lights should stay on.
   Consequently, traditional IP multicast cannot be used for such
   applications.  The light controller forms the groups and decides
   which light modules should receive "turn-off" or "turn-on" requests.

3.2.  Moving a remote control around

   Advanced multi-function remote control may be used for dimming the
   light in the dining room while eating, turning up the music while
   doing the dishes in the kitchen and then, later on, turn lights down
   and start a DVD in the home theater.  The music is stopped at the
   same time.  Reaction must appear to be instant (within a few hundreds
   of milliseconds) even when the remote control has moved to a new
   location.  Devices that needed routing to be reached before may be
   accessible directly now and vice versa.

3.3.  Adding a new lamp module to the system

   This apparently simple action may be addressed in a number of ways,
   depending on philosophy.  The main issue is that the small-size, low-
   cost modules may have no user interface except for a single button.
   Thus, an automated inclusion process is needed for light controllers
   to find new modules.

3.3.1.  Register lamp with portable remote control

   A remote control may control all lamps in the house.  The new lamp
   module is powered at its final location.  A discovery mechanism
   (potentially based on a broadcast-based protocol) makes the remote
   control discover the new module within direct range.  The user sets
   up rules in the remote control for control of the lamp module.  The
   lamp module being powered up at the final location triggers routing
   update.  But because the (portable) remote control goes to sleep just
   after the last communication, the routers cannot determine the
   location of the remote control by probing for it.

3.3.2.  Register lamp with central light controller; then place lamp

   In this scenario a central light controller controls all lamps in the
   house.  The new lamp module is powered within direct range of the
   light controller.  A discovery (potentially based on a broadcast-
   based protocol) makes the light controller discover the new module.
   The user sets up rules in the light controller for control of the
   lamp module.  Then the lamp module is placed at its final location.
   The lamp module being powered up at the final location causes routers
   to update routes.

3.3.3.  Register lamp outlet and wall switch with light controller

   In this scenario, a central light controller is still used to
   controls all lamps in the house.  It is practical to mount an outlet
   and get it registered at the same time.  The same applies to wall
   switches.  The wall switch may be out of direct range of the lamp
   module.  At least two scenarios can be envisioned:

3.3.3.1.  Installer controller used to set up rules

   A special portable controller is used to first discover the lamp
   outlet and the wall switch locally, i.e. within direct reach of their
   respective locations.  Then rules are set up in the light controller
   for the new lamp outlet and wall switch.  The lamp module being
   powered up at the final location triggers routing updates.

3.3.3.2.  Global discovery

   The lamp outlet and wall switch devices announce themselves to the
   network.  If already armed for an inclusion, routers carry the
   announcement to the light controller.  Then rules are set up in the
   light controller for the new lamp outlet and wall switch.  The lamp
   module being powered up at the final location triggers routing
   updates.

3.3.4.  Alarm systems

   This section will be documented in further revision of this document.

3.3.5.  Remote video surveillance

   This section will be documented in further revision of this document.

3.3.6.  Healthcare

   This section will be documented in further revision of this document.

4.  Unique requirements of home automation applications

   Home automation applications have a number of specific requirements
   related to the perceived operation of the system.

4.1.  Support of groupcast

   The routing protocol MUST support multicast routing with various
   scopes: local subnet, all devices.  In other words, the routing
   protocol MUST provide the ability to route a packet toward a single
   device, a set of devices or all devices in the house.

   It may be discussed how to achieve group addressing with IP
   addressing schemes.  Some home automation systems require low-level
   addressing of a group of nodes in the same subnet without any prior
   creation of multicast groups, simply carrying a list of recipients in
   the subnet.  Thus the routing protocol MUST support the ability to
   route a packet destined to a single device, a set of devices or all
   devices.

   With IP Multicast, signalling mechanisms are used by a receivers to
   join a group and the sender does not necessarily know the receivers
   of the group.  What is required is the ability to address a group of
   receivers known by the sender even if the receivers do not need to
   know that they have been grouped by the sender (requesting each
   individual node to join a multicast group will be very impractical):
   this is referred to as "groupcast" mechanism in this document.

4.2.  Node constrained Routing

   Battery-powered nodes such as movement sensors on garage doors and
   rain meters may not be able to assist in routing.  Depending on the
   node type, the node never listens at all, listens rarely or makes
   contact on demand to a pre-configured target node.  Attempting to
   communicate to such nodes may require long time before getting a
   response.

   The routing engine MUST be aware of special node properties caused
   for example by battery conservation.  Thus the routing process MUST
   support node constrained routing.

4.3.  Support of Mobility

   In a residential home environment, although the majority of devices
   are fixed devices, there is still a variety of mobile devices: for
   example a remote control used for multiple purposes is likely to
   move.  Another example of mobile devices is wearable healthcare
   devices.

   The routing protocol MUST provide mobility with convergence time
   within a few hundreds of milli-seconds.

4.4.  Quality of Service (QoS) Routing

   Home networks typically hosts a variety of applications such as FTP,
   HTTP, and so on as well as home automation traffic.  It is expected
   to see in such networks several classes of services.  Although is
   most cases a single topology supporting several classes of services
   may be sufficient, the support of traffic substantially differing in
   nature (e.g.  Low priority high volume traffic such as email with
   high priority low volume traffic for alarm detection) may require for
   the routing protocol to support more than one topologies.

   RL2N MAY provide the ability to support multi-topology routing.

4.5.  Scalability

   Looking at the number of wall switches and power outlets in a modern
   house, it seems quite realistic that hundreds low power devices may
   form a home automation network in a fully populated smart home.
   Moving towards professional building automation, the number of such
   devices may be on the order of several thousands.

   Thus the routing protocol MUST be highly scalable supporting a large
   number of devices.

4.6.  Convergence Time

   Home automation is clearly an L2N subject to various instability due
   to signal strength variation.  Furthermore, as the number of (battery
   powered) devices increases, the probability of node failure may also
   increase.  In all cases, response time of the order of a few hundreds
   of milliseconds are required, implying that the routing protocol MUST
   converge (provide alternate routes upon link or node failure) within
   a few hundreds of milliseconds.

4.7.  Delay Tolerant Networks

   TBD.

4.8.  Manageability

   TBD

5.  Traffic pattern

   Depending on the philosophy of the home automation system, wall
   switches may be configured to directly control individual lamps or
   alternatively, all wall switches send control commands to a central
   lighting control computer which again sends out control commands to
   relevant light devices.  In a distributed system, the traffic tends
   to be any-to-many.  In a centralized system, it is a mix of one-to-
   one and one-to-many.


6.  Open issues

   Other items to be addressed in further revisions of this document
   include:

   * Mobility and traffic pattern,

   * Load Balancing (Symmetrical and Asymmetrical),

   * Security.
