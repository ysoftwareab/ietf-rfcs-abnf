   order to establish a data channel, referred to as CLUE Data Channel,
   for transporting CLUE protocol messages between two CLUE entities.

   The document defines the SCTP considerations specific to a CLUE Data
   Channel, the SDP Media Description- and SDP dcmap attribute values,
   and the DCEP procedures for opening, a CLUE Data Channel.

   Details and procedures associated with the CLUE protocol, and the SDP
   Offer/Answer procedures for negotiating a CLUE data channel, are

Internet-Draft         CLUE Protocol Data Channel          November 2014


1.  Introduction

   This document defines how to use the WebRTC Data Channel mechanism
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel], together with the Data Channel
   Establishment Protocol (DCEP) [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-protocol] and the
   SDP-based "SCTP over DTLS" data channel negotiation mechanism [add-
   ref], in order to establish a data channel, referred to as CLUE Data
   Channel, for transporting CLUE protocol [I-D.ietf-clue-protocol]
   messages between CLUE entities.

   The document defines the SCTP considerations specific to a CLUE Data
   Channel, the SDP Media Description- and SDP dcmap attribute values,
   and the DCEP procedures for opening, a CLUE Data Channel.

   Details and procedures associated with the CLUE protocol, and the SDP
   Offer/Answer [RFC3264] procedures for negotiating a CLUE data
   channel, are outside the scope of this document.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

   WebRTC Data Channel refers to a SCTPoDTLS association
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-encaps] that is used to transport non-media
   data between two entities, according to the procedures in
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel].

   CLUE Data Channel refers to a WebRTC Data Channel
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel], with a specific set of SCTP
   characteristics, and usage of the Data Channel Establishment Protocol
   (DCEP) [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-protocol] in order to open a WebRTC Data
   Channel for the purpose of transporting CLUE protocol
   [I-D.ietf-clue-protocol] messages between two CLUE entities.

   CLUE entity refers to a SIP User Agent (UA) [RFC3261] that supports
   the CLUE Data Channel and the CLUE protocol.

   CLUE session refers to a SIP session [RFC3261] between to SIP UAs,
   where a CLUE Data Channel, associated with the SIP session, has been
   established between the SIP UAs.

   [RFC4960] defines an SCTP stream as a unidirectional logical channel
   established from one to another associated SCTP endpoint, within
   which all user messages are delivered in sequence except for those
   submitted to the unordered delivery service.

Internet-Draft         CLUE Protocol Data Channel          November 2014


   [RFC4960] defines an SCTP identifier as a unsigned integer, which
   identifies a SCTP stream.

3.  CLUE Data Channel

3.1.  General

   This section describes the realization of a CLUE Data Channel.  This
   includes a set of SCTP characteristics specific to a CLUE Data
   Channel, the usage of the SDP-based "SCTP over DTLS" data channel
   negotiation mechanism to describe a CLUE data channel in SDP, and the
   usage of the Data Channel Establishment Protocol (DCEP)
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-protocol] in order to open a WebRTC Data
   Channel for the purpose of transporting CLUE protocol
   [I-D.ietf-clue-protocol] messages between two CLUE entities.

   As described in [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel], the SCTP streams
   realizing a WebRTC Data Channel must be associated with the same SCTP
   association.  In addition, both SCTP streams realizing the WebRTC
   Data Channel must use the same SCTP stream identifier value.  These
   rules also apply to a CLUE Data Channel.

   Within a given CLUE session, a CLUE entity MUST use a single CLUE
   Data Channel for transport of all CLUE messages towards its peer.

3.2.  SDP Considerations

3.2.1.  General

   This section defines how to construct the SDP Media Description ("m="
   line), and the associated SDP dcmap attribute, used to describe a
   CLUE data channel in SDP.

   [I-D.ietf-clue-signaling] describes the SDP Offer/Answer procedures
   for negotiating a CLUE session, including the CLUE controlled media
   streams and the CLUE data channel.

3.2.2.  SDP Media Description Fields

   The field values of the "m=" line for the SCTPoDTLS association are
   set as following:

          Figure 1: SDP Media Description for a CLUE Data Channel

3.3.  Data Channel Establishment Protocol (DCEP) Considerations

3.3.1.  General

   A CLUE entity MUST support the Data Channel Establishment Protocol
   (DCEP) [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel], which can be used in order to
   open a WebRTC Data Channel.

   This section describes how to open and close a CLUE data channel
   using DCEP.

3.3.2.  Open CLUE Data Channel

   Once the SCTP association, to be used to realized the CLUE Data
   Channel, has been established, the offerer [RFC3264] is responsible
   for opening the CLUE Data Channel.  If DCEP is used, the offerer MUST
   send a DCEP DATA_CHANNEL_OPEN message
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-protocol].  The value of the 'protocol' field
   MUST be "CLUE".  The value of the 'channel type' MUST be
   'DATA_CHANNEL_RELIABLE'.

   Once the offerer has received the associated DCEP DATA_CHANNEL_ACK
   message [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-protocol], the CLUE Data channel has
   been opened.

   If the offerer receives a DCEP DATA_CHANNEL_OPEN message, for the
   purpose of opening a CLUE Data Channel, the offerer MUST reset the
   SCTP stream, in order to prevent two CLUE Data Channels from being
   established within the same CLUE session.  The offerer MUST NOT send
   a DCEP DATA_CHANNEL_ACK message.

3.3.3.  Close CLUE Data Channel

   DCEP [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-protocol] does not define a message for
   closing a WebRTC Data Channel.  As described in
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-protocol], in order to close a CLUE Data
   Channel, a SCTP reset message is sent, in order to close the SCTP
   stream associated with the CLUE Data Channel.  The SCTP association,

Internet-Draft         CLUE Protocol Data Channel          November 2014


   and WebRTC Data Channels associated with other SCTP streams, are not
   affected by the SCTP reset message.

3.3.4.  SCTP Association Failure

   In case of SCTP association failure, the offerer is responsible for
   trying to re-establish the SCTP association (including sending a new
   SDP offer, if needed).  Once the SCTP association has been
   successfully re-established, the offerer is responsible for sending a
   DCEP DATA_CHANNEL_OPEN message.

3.4.  SCTP Considerations

3.4.1.  SCTP Payload Protocol Identifier (PPID)

   As described in [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-protocol], the PPID value 50 is
   used when sending a DCEP message on a WebRTC Data Channel.

   A CLUE entity MUST use the PPID value 51 when sending a CLUE message
   on a CLUE Data Channel.

   NOTE: As described in [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel], the PPID value
   51 indicates that the SCTP message contains data encoded in a UTF-8
   format.  The PPID value 51 does not indicate what application
   protocol is transported in a WebRTC Data Channel, only the format in
   which the data is encoded.

                         +----------+------------+
                         | Protocol | PPID Value |
                         +----------+------------+
                         |   DCEP   |     50     |
                         |   CLUE   |     51     |
                         +----------+------------+

                  Table 4: CLUE Data Channel PPID Values

3.4.2.  Reliability

   The usage of SCTP for the CLUE Data Channel ensures reliable
   transport of CLUE protocol [I-D.ietf-clue-protocol] messages.

   A CLUE entity MUST NOT use the partial reliability and limited
   retransmission extensions defined in [RFC3758].

   NOTE: [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel] requires the support of the
   partial reliability extension defined in [RFC3758].  This is not
   needed for a CLUE Data Channel, as messages are required to always be
   sent reliably.  [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel] also mandates support

Internet-Draft         CLUE Protocol Data Channel          November 2014


   of the limited retransmission policy defined in
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-sctp-prpolicies].

3.4.3.  Order

   A CLUE entity MUST use the ordered delivery SCTP service, as
   described in section 6.6 of [RFC4960].

3.4.4.  Stream Reset

   A CLUE entity MUST support the stream reset extension defined in
   [RFC6525].

   The dynamic address reconfiguration extension defined in [RFC5061]
   MUST be used to signal the support of the stream reset extension
   defined in [RFC6525].  Other features of [RFC5061] MUST NOT be used.

3.4.5.  SCTP Multihoming

   SCTP multihoming cannot be used for a CLUE Data Channel.

   NOTE: SCTPoDTLS does not support SCTP multihoming.

4.  Security Considerations

   This specification does not introduce new security considerations, in
   addition to those defined in [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel] and
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-protocol].  Security considerations associated
   with the CLUE protocol are defined in [I-D.ietf-clue-protocol].

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  New WebRTC Data Channel Protocol Value

   [RFC EDITOR NOTE: Please replace RFC-XXXX with the RFC number of this
   document.]

   This document adds the 'CLUE' value to the "WebSocket Subprotocol
   Name Registry" as follows:


       Subprotocl Identifier:      CLUE
       Subprotocol Common Name:    CLUE
       Subprotocol Definition:     RFC-XXXX
