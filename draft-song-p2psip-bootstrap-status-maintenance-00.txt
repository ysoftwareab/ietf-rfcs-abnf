                  P2PSIP Bootstrap Status Maintenance
           draft-song-p2psip-bootstrap-status-maintenance-00

Abstract

   In order to join the overlay, a joining peer/client has to find the
   enrollment server first, and then acquire the configuration file from
   the enrollment server where it can find the bootstrap peers'
   information, and after that it contact a bootstrap node to route the
   join request message to join the overlay.  However, nodes in P2PSIP
   overlay network are dynamic.  They can leave gracefully or abruptly
   at any time.  This document focuses on the bootstrap server mechanism
   and proposes a mechanism to select proper bootstrap peers and improve
   the availability of bootstrap nodes through bootstrap peer status
   maintenance.

Internet-Draft     P2PSIP Bootstrap Status Maintenance     February 2010


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Background

   The base draft [I-D.ietf-p2psip-base] introduces a few mechanisms for
   bootstrap.  A joining peer can use the bootstrap peer list from the
   configuration file, or uses its previous cached neighbor peers to
   bootstrap, or use the multicast or broadcast mechanism to acquire
   bootstrap peers.  Another draft
   [I-D.matthews-p2psip-bootstrap-mechanisms] also proposed bootstrap
   server and multicast mechanisms.  The simplest way is to use the
   bootstrap peer information from the configuration file, but there are
   a few open questions here.

   a.  How to get the bootstrap peer and which peers are qualified as
   bootstrap peers?  There are a few requirements for a capable
   bootstrap peer here. (a.1) According to the base draft and mailing
   list discussion, the address of the bootstrap peer in the
   configuration file must be publicly reachable.  It is very hard to
   find a technique can ensure that in every deployment scenarios.  But
   in real world, each application may look its own deployment scenario
   and design its own way to select the "publicly reachable" peers
   according to real environment. (a.2) it should be online. (a.3) it
   should have enough available processing resources

   b.  How to maintain the bootstrap peer list info to keep them valid
   to use?  Peers in the overlay are dynamic, and each peer can leave
   the overlay abruptly at anytime.  This is the main concern of this
   document.

   c.  How to avoid hot spot problem on a specific bootstrap peer when a
   bunch of peers join simultaneously?

   This document will try to solve the above questions by giving a
   promising solution.

1.2.  Bootstrap status maintenance

   Here is the procedure of the mechanism proposed by this document.
   (Assume that the overlay operator configures a fixed number of
   bootstrap peers in the configuration file, say N)

   a.  After each joining peer joins the overlay network successfully.
   Each joining peer will send a message to a TURN server.  This TURN
   server could be a peer with publicly reachable address found in the
   overlay, or a server provided by the overlay operator.  If the
   reflexive peer address is the same with its local address, then it
   sends a message to the enrollment server to report its processing

   resources and identifies itself as a candidate bootstrap peer.

   b.  Enrollment server selects a bootstrap peer from its local
   candidate bootstrap peer database, and then send a message to check
   the aliveness of this peer.  And finally it gets N live bootstrap
   peers.  And send notifications to the N bootstrap peers.  We should
   reuse the existing messages whenever possible here to notify the
   bootstrap peer about its election of the bootstrap peer role.

   c.  The N bootstrap peers are listed in the bootstrap peer list.
   They report their busy status to the enrollment server in period.
   And enrollment server uses round robin mechanism to change their
   sequence in the list for load balance.  We should reuse the existing
   messages whenever possible to do the status report mentioned here.

   d.  If the enrollment server has not received the report from a
   certain bootstrap peer for several periods, or find a bootstrap peer
   is congested according to its report, or receive a notification that
   the specific bootstrap peer is about to leave the overly, then the
   enrollment server will select another bootstrap peer from the capable
   bootstrap peer database to replace the invalid or congested one.  The
   enrollment server still needs to check the aliveness of this new
   candidate and then notify it about its election as the bootstrap
   peer.

   There should be a way to keep the number of bootstrap peer candidates
   within a limited number, say M. So the enrollment server should
   prioritize the candidate peers, and remove the candidate peers in the
   rear of the list after the first M peers.  And the list should be
   refreshed in period.  However, this is an internal implementation
   issue.


2.  Terminology

   The concepts used in this document are compatible with "Concepts and
   Terminology for Peer to Peer SIP" [I-D.ietf-p2psip-concepts] and the
   P2PSIP base protocol RELOAD [I-D.ietf-p2psip-base].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Message Process

Internet-Draft     P2PSIP Bootstrap Status Maintenance     February 2010


3.1.  peer messages

   These messages are generated by the bootstrap peer or bootstrap peer
   candidates and be sent to the enrollment server.

3.1.1.  Message to identify the peer itself as a capable bootstrap peer

   Open question: Shall we extend PING message here? <to say "I'm
   capable to be a bootstrap peer, and here is my contact and processing
   resource information">

3.1.2.  Message for bootstrap peer to report busy status

   Open question: shall we extend PING message here? <to report the
   peer's status information>

3.2.  Enrollment server messages

   These messages are generated by the enrollment server and be sent to
   the bootstrap peers.

3.2.1.  Message to check the aliveness of the bootstrap peer

   The enrollment server just send an Inspect message
   [I-D.ietf-p2psip-diagnostics], and sets the destination ID with the
   bootstrap peer's peer ID, send it directly to this bootstrap peer's
   IP address.

   (1) If the enrollment server receives an Inspect response with the
   source ID using the bootstrap peer's peer ID, then this bootstrap
   peer is alive.

   (2) If the enrollment server does not receive any response, it will
   try several times, till it can ensure that the peer has left the
   overlay.  Or finally get a response.

3.2.2.  Message to notify the election of a bootstrap peer

   Open question: shall we extend PING message here? <to say "you are
   selected as a bootstrap peer">, that means, the peer received this
   message will have to deal with upcoming Join message thereafter and
   has to report its busy status to the enrollment server in period.


4.  Security Considerations

   The enrollment server and the bootstrap peer have to do mutual
   authentication when communicate with each other to prevent from

   There is no IANA consideration in this document.
