Abstract  
    
   This draft describes the use of COPS-PR for support of a PDP 
   provisioning a PEP with RSVP policy control criteria and defines a 
   RSVP policy control criteria PIB for this purpose. The RSVPCC-PIB 
   described in the document is provided for definition of policies  
   that are currently defined by the outsourcing model [2749]. It is 
   designed to be scalable and flexible as well as extensible for  
   accommodating future policy criteria.

1 Introduction 
    
   The RSVP Policy Control Criteria PIB defines the policy criteria 
   used to authorize an RSVP reservation request. The policy criteria 
   defined by this PIB are enforced by the RSVP enabled Policy 
   Enforcement Point (PEP). These are provisioned by the Policy 
   Decision Point (PDP) rather than outsourced to the PDP.  
    
   Policy control is an important processing component described in 
   RSVP [2205]. While admission control evaluates the resources 
   available at the RSVP enabled interface, it does not determine if 
   the requested reservation is allowed. Policy control determines 
   whether the policy is allowed (or authorized.) It may base the 
   decision on multiple factors including application identification, 
   policy authentication preemption rules and service level agreements. 
    
   Two basic models are defined for prescribing policy to a network 
   enforcement device using COPS [2748]. First, there is an outsourcing 
   mechanism for policy control where the network device requests a 
   policy decision from an external policy server and is defined in 
   [2749]. This mechanism can be used in conjunction with a local 
   decision policy scheme that outsources information to the PDP for 
   confirmation of the locally made decision [2753]. There also exists 
   a policy configuration mechanism that does not require the network 
   device to outsource all policy decisions. The device is provisioned 
   with decision policy a priori of the traffic flow.  The provisioning 
   model relies upon Policy Information Bases (PIB) that define the 
   policies to be enforced by the PEP. [COPS-PR.] 
    
   Currently there is no PIB defining RSVP policy control criteria to 
   be conveyed by the provisioning model. Provisioned policy control 
   criteria are useful in topologies where large numbers of signaling 
   flows are transiting a set of well know boundary devices.  The sheer 
   volume and nature of the application generating RSVP signals (such 
   as with VoIP) may make outsourcing policy impractical at some 
   boundary devices. The use of local policy control criteria is an 
   attractive alternative to going off-board to another policy device 
   for all PATH and RESV messages and their associated contexts 
   (Incoming  / Allocation / Outgoing), which reduces the response time 
   of policy control and the amount of policy control traffic on the 
   network. 
    
   However, reliance on a network operator to manually provision the 
   policy criteria locally per device is not a preferred solution. It 
   is labor-intensive and time-consuming as well as error prone. It 
   also limits the flexibility of policy control. For example, it 
   prohibits the possibility of customer self-provisioning policy 
   controlled services, which is a provisioning mechanism driven by 
   both service providers and customers. This document proposes a 
   mechanism to automatically provision RSVP policy control criteria on 
   the network devices.

2 General Concepts 
    
2.1 Overview 
    
   This document defines a RSVP Policy Control Criteria PIB. The RSVP 
   Policy Control Criteria PIB provides the policy classes describing 
   the criteria for policy control to the PEP so it does not need to 
   outsource decisions for all RSVP signals. 
    
   Together with the PIB defined in this document, COPS-PR is used to 
   push RSVP related policy control criteria from a PDP to a PEP. Thus 
   the RSVP policy control criteria are installed on the PEP a priori 
   of the impacted RSVP signals and policy control decisions for RSVP 
   messages passing the PEP can be made locally. 
    
   The use of provisioned policy criteria does not prohibit the 
   outsourcing of policy decisions. The outsourcing and provisioned 
   policy approaches may be used in combination with each other as 
   defined by three Êprocessing models∆: 
   - Take local decisions AND outsource each request to the PDP for 
   confirmation as described in [2753]. 
   - Take local decisions and outsource ONLY IF no relevant local 
   policy is found. 
   - Take local decisions only. Do not outsource. 
    
    
   Feedback must be provided to the PDP about the usage of policy at 
   the PEP. The PEP monitors, tracks and provides periodic accounting 
   type reports to the PDP.  
    
    
2.2 Normal Operation 
    
   When a PEP is initialized, a COPS session connection is established 
   for SUBJECT_CATEGORY RSVP-PCC between the PEP and PDP. The PEP 
   issues the request for initial configuration describing its basic 
   PIB policy capabilities per [POLFRWK.] The policy classes supported 
   by the PEP are indicated with the PRCSupportTable instances. The PEP 
   also describes the policy model capability associated with that 
   interface using an instance of the RSVPPccCapTable. 
    
   The Policy Decision Point determines the appropriate policy 
   information to supply the PEP and responds with a decision install. 
   The PEP confirms the success or failure of the configuration 
   decision with a report. 
    
   The failover operation of the PEP and PDP is described in [COPS-PR.] 
     
    
2.3 RSVP Policy Processing Models with local policy criteria  
    
   The policy control processing follows one of three possible models: 
    
  
Rawlins et al.             Expires May 2001                   [Page 4] 

Internet Draft               RSVP-PCC-PIB                November 2000 
 
 
   - One model is the LDP model [2753]. The installed policy criteria 
   are used to make Local Decision. If local policy approves the 
   reservation request the RSVP message continues its normal 
   processing. The LDP then confirms the decision with the PDP by 
   issuing a request with the LPDP Decsion Object. The PDP then issues 
   a final decision which is enforced by the PEP. 
    
   - The second model is where the PEP performs policy control by 
   approving a reservation request based on installed policy criteria. 
   In the event that no policy exists for the reservation request, the 
   PEP then outsources the request to the PDP. The PDP then decides to 
   approve or deny the request [2749]. In other words, when a PEP 
   receives a RSVP message, it first queries Local RSVP policy control 
   criteria if there is one existing on the PEP. Otherwise, the PEP 
   uses COPS-RSVP to query PDP for outsourcing policy decisions.  
   Note that the PEP must send periodic reports to the PDP informing it 
   of all factors that affect decision-making at the PDP e.g. the 
   resource usage etc. Also, all pending reports should be sent to the 
   PDP before a request is outsourced to it. This helps the PDP 
   maintain an accurate picture of resource availability at the PEP 
   while making decisions. 
    
   - The third model is where the PEP relies entirely upon the 
   provisioned policy control criteria for its policy control decision-
   making. If no policies are found for a policy request of a RSVP 
   session, the RSVP session should be rejected. 
    
    
2.4 Session Classification and Reservation Styles 
    
   The IP filters, frwkIPFilterTable, described in [POLFRWK] are used 
   to associate the authorization (or enforcement) policy with a RSVP 
   session. These filter instances provide the ability to identify the 
   flow 5-tuple: source address, source port, destination address, 
   destination port and protocol id. The RSVP Sender_Template Class, 
   FilterSpec Class and Session Class can be classified using the 
   frwkIPFilterTable. The 5-tuple filter instances may be defined using 
   a wildcard value for the attribute, which accommodates 
   classification policies for the RSVP reservation styles ˚ Fixed 
   Filter, Shared Explicit and Wildcard.  
    
3 PIB Summary 
    
   Multiple sets of policy control criteria are installed at the PEP.  
   A set of policy criteria basically contains elements of filter 
   policy, authorization policy, linkage policy and usage policy. The 
   filter policy identifies the signal flows to which to apply the 
   authorization policy. The authorization policy defines the 
   enforcement rules. The linkage policy associates the filter policy 
   with an authorization policy. The usage policy provides feedback to 
   the PDP according to what the PEP has monitored, recorded and 
   reported to the PDP via an accounting type report.

   A single set of policy authorization rules or usage policies can be 
   associated with a number of filter policies. A filter policy is used 
   to uniquely identify a flow.  
    
   The basic kinds of policies are capability, PPC linkage and 
   authorization.  
    
   It would be useful in the future to consider policies that define 
   the monitoring, recording, and reporting of usage information by the 
   PEP to the PDP. These would provide feedback to the PDP on which it 
   could base future configuration decisions. 
    
3.1 Capabilities Table - policyControlCapsTable 
    
   This table provides a single instance describing the device∆s policy 
   model or mode. There are three modes. There is LDP mode where the 
   local policy criteria are the basis of the policy control and then 
   the PEP outsources a confirmation request using an LDPDecison 
   object.  Another mode is where the local policy criteria are 
   checked, and if absent; the request is outsourced to the PDP. And a 
   third mode is where only the provisioned policy criteria are used 
   for the decision. No outsourcing is associated with this third mode. 
    
3.2 PPC Linkage Table  - pccLinkTable 
    
   This table defines the association between the filter policy and the 
   authorization policy. The PPC Linkage Class references the filter 
   PRID as well as the PRID of the authorization policy class. It links 
   the two instances. (The PRID is the Object Identifier constructed 
   with the PRC and the instance id as the last sub-identifier.) Note 
   that the same filter may have multiple authorization policies. For 
   example a filter may have a Traffic Specifier policy, a Rate 
   Specifier policy and Preemption policy that should be used as policy 
   criteria for determining if the flow is allowed.  
    
   There is future work needed to explore the optimization of the 
   association of filters with authorization policies.   
    
3.3 Authorization Policy Tables  
    
   The Authorization tables contain the enforcement policy classes that 
   determine whether the RSVP reservation is allowed. These policy 
   classes describe the Integrated Services Controlled Load and 
   Guaranteed Services, [2210,2211,2212,2215], the identity 
   authorization user and authorization application policies [2752], 
   and the preemption policies [2751.] The policy classes included in 
   this group are: 
 
   1) Traffic Specifier (Tspec) Policies 
   Defines the transmission rate of the traffic flow. 
    
   2) RSPEC Limits

Internet Draft               RSVP-PCC-PIB                November 2000 
 
 
   Defines the requested service rate from the network related with 
   Guaranteed Services.  
    
   3) Identification Authentication Data Policy Elements 
   Defines means to securely identify the owner or application making 
   the reservation request. 
    
    
   4) Priority Preemption Policy Elements 
   Defines the relative order of importance of the requested flow and 
   permits the preemption of lesser important flows to allow higher 
   priority flows admission. 
 
3.5 Example 
    
   Authorization policies are defined in terms of TRAFFIC SPECIFIER and 
   RSPEC characteristics as well as Integrated Services type i.e. 
   Controlled Load or Guaranteed Services. Additional criteria such as 
   Policy Authentication and Priority Preemption can also be specified. 
 
   An example set of policy control criteria is as follows. The 
   SenderTemplate and Filterspec are compared against the policy 
   control criteria filters by the PEP. The filter is associated with a 
   set of authorization rules with the linkage policies. For example, 
   policy control criteria could establish authorization for the Gold 
   and Silver VoIP services. The Gold VoIP could be defined as allowing 
   a guaranteed service request, within a traffic specifier and rspec 
   limit, with a high preemption priority and high preemption defending 
   priority. A Silver VoIP could be defined as granting a controlled 
   load service request, within a traffic specifier and rspec limit, 
   with a moderate preemption priority and low preemption defending 
   priority.

5 Security Considerations 
    
   "..The use of IPSEC between the PDP and the PEP, as described in 
   [2748], provides the necessary protection against security threats. 
   However, even if the network itself is secure, there is no control 
   as to who on the secure network is allowed to "Install/Notify" 
   (read/change/create/delete) the PRIs in this PIB. It is then a 
   customer/user responsibility to ensure that the PEP/PDP giving 
   access to an instance of this PIB, is properly configured to give 
   access to the PRIs only to those principals (users) that have   
   legitimate rights to indeed "Install" or "Notify" (change/create/ 
   delete) them‡" [POLFRWK]
