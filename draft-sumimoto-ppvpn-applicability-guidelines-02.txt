Abstract

   This document is expected to be guidelines to assist development of
   applicability statements for each PPVPN approach by providing a
   check-list which consists of requirements/metrics. This check-list is
   systematically composed of (i)requirements and metrics common to all
   PPVPNs, (ii)requirements and metrics common to L3 PPVPN approaches,
   (iii)requirements and metrics specific to L3 PE-based PPVPN

   approaches, (iv)requirements and metrics specific to L3 CE-based
   PPVPN approaches and (v)requirements and metrics common to L2 PPVPN
   approaches, according to the classification of PPVPN approaches.

1. Summary for Sub-IP Area

1.1 Summary

   This document is expected to be guidelines to assist development of
   applicability statements of PPVPNs by providing a check-list which
   consists of requirements/metrics. PPVPNs are classified into multiple
   specific PPVPN approaches based on their characteristics. These PPVPN
   approaches closely relate each other by sharing a portion of the
   characteristics. Therefore, it is necessary to provide a check-list
   for developing applicability statements of each PPVPN approach by
   extracting requirements/metrics according to the mechanisms of PPVPN
   approaches out of the service requirements of the requirements
   documents. This document systematically provides such a check-list
   along with the classification of PPVPN approaches.

1.2 Where does it fit in the Picture of the Sub-IP Work

   This document fits in ppvpn WG.

1.3 Why is it Targeted at this WG

   The ppvpn charter clearly defines development of applicability
   statements documents for PPVPN approaches as a working item of ppvpn
   WG. Since this document is expected to assist these approach specific
   applicability statements documents, ppvpn WG is appropriate as the
   home of this document.

(*)We do not need justification as this document directly fits in ppvpn
   WG.

2. Introduction

   *** Goal and Role (This comment is to be deleted) ***

   The term "PPVPNs"refers to Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) for which
   the service provider participates in management and provisioning of
   the VPN. PPVPNs can be classified into several PPVPN classes based on
   their characteristics, and these PPVPN classes closely relate each
   other by sharing some portion of the characteristics. Therefore, so
   as to make approach-specific applicability statements significant, it
   is necessary to systematically extract requirements/metrics directly
   relating to protocols/mechanisms out of the service requirements
   described in the requirements documents[PPVPN-REQ]. This document

   provides a check-list which consists of the extracted
   requirements/metrics. Each metric in the list is intended to clearly
   point out what must be written in each approach specific
   applicability statements documents, thus detailed description with
   regard to the metric is out of scope of this document.

   *** Scope and Organization (This comment is to be deleted) ***

   PPVPN approaches for which applicability statements are to be
   developed are,
    - BGP MPLS VPNs[2547bis] and VR VPNs[VPN-VR, 2917bis] as L3
      PE-based PPVPNs,
    - IPsec VPNs[VPN-IPsec] as L3 CE-based PPVPNs,
    - BGP signaled L2VPNs[], LDP signaled L2VPNs (with/without
      Directory)[], RSVP signaled L2VPNs[] as L2 PE-based PPVPNs.
      (To be updated)
   Definition and classification of PPVPN approaches are overviewed in
   Section 3. Section 4 provides list and outline of
   requirements/metrics systematically according to the classification
   of PPVPN approaches. Section 5 is for security considerations, and
   section 6 is for references.

3. PPVPN technical overview

   This section provides a brief overview on the various types of PPVPNs
   as an introductory guidance toward discussions in the rest of this
   document and in developing approach-specific applicability statements
   documents. Detailed description is provided in the framework
   document[PPVPN-FR].

   PPVPNs can be classified into
      - L3 PPVPNs / L2 PPVPNs
   from the viewpoint of service layer for customers. On the other hand,
   PPVPNs can be classified into
      - PE based PPVPNs / CE-based PPVPNs
   by the terminating point of VPN tunnels. Since these two keys of
   classification are independent each other, four PPVPN classes are
   defined after all. The rest of this section briefly overview each of
   L3 PE-based VPNs, L3 CE-based VPNs, and L2 PE-based VPNs, out of the
   four classes, which is covered by the following sections of this
   document.

   - Layer 3 PE-based VPNs

     A layer 3 PE-based VPN is one in which PE devices in the SP network
     provide the VPN-specific functions and SP forwards packets based on
     layer 3 information.  BGP MPLS and VR approach are included in this
     class.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                             March 1, 2001


   - Layer 3 CE-based VPNs

     In CE-based VPNs, the VPN-specific functions (e.g. tunneling) are
     deployed in the CE devices, while the provider network has no VPN
     awareness on the data-plane level. SP forwards packets based on
     layer 3 information. IPsec VPN is included in this class.

   - Layer 2 PE-based VPNs

     A layer 2 PE-based VPN is one in which PE devices in the SP network
     provide the VPN-specific functions and SP forwards packets based on
     layer 2 information.  BGP signaled L2VPNs, LDP signaled L2VPNs
     (with/without Directory), and RSVP signaled L2VPNs are included in
     this class.

4. List and outline of requirements and metrics for evaluating each
   PPVPN approach

   This section provides list and outline of requirements/metrics common
   to all PPVPNs (in Section 4.1), common to L3 PPVPN approaches (in
   Section 4.2), specific to L3 PE-based PPVPN approaches (in Section
   4.3), specific to L3 CE-based PPVPN approaches (in Section 4.4) and
   common to L2 PE-based PPVPN approaches (in Section 4.5), according to
   the classification of PPVPN approaches. Note that
   requirements/metrics for a higher PPVPN class must apply to any
   inheriting lower PPVPN classes (maybe concurrently, if multiple lower
   PPVPN classes provisioned in an SP network concurrently). For
   example, VR approach must be checked not only by requirements/metrics
   for specific to L3 PE-based PPVPN approaches but also by
   requirements/metrics common to all PPVPNs and common to L3 PPVPN
   approaches.  In this section, AS stands for Applicability Statements.

4.1 Requirements and metrics common to all PPVPNs
