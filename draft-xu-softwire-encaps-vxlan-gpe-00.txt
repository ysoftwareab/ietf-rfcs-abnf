Internet-Draft Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute for VXLAN-gpe   July 2013 
 
    
1. Introduction 

   [RFC5512] specifies a method by which Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) 
   speakers can signal tunnel encapsulation information to each other 
   and accordingly it defines support for Generic Routing Encapsulation 
   (GRE)[RFC2784], Layer Two Tunneling Protocol - Version 3 (L2TPv3) 
   [RFC3931] and IP in IP [RFC2003] tunnel types. This document builds 
   on [RFC5512] and defines support for VXLAN-gpe [VXLAN-gpe] tunnel 
   type. VXLAN-gpe stands for the extended VXLAN encapsulation format 
   which contains a Protocol Type field in the VXLAN header and can be 
   used for both Layer2 and Layer3 VPN service, in other words, the 
   VXLAN-gpe tunnel can be used to transport either IP packets or 
   Ethernet frames. 

2. Terminology 

   This memo makes use of the terms defined in [RFC5512].  

3. BGP Tunnel Type Code for VXLAN-gpe 

   To use either the Encapsulation Subsequent Address Family Identifier 
   (SAFI) or the BGP Encapsulation Extended Community defined in 
   [RFC5512] to signal the VXLAN-gpe tunnel type information across BGP 
   speakers, a new Tunnel Type code (TBD) indicating such tunnel type 
   needs to be assigned by IANA.  

   This document does not specify any specific sub-TLV. Furthermore, the 
   BGP Encapsulation Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) 
   Format is not modified by this document. 

4. Security Considerations 

   The security considerations mentioned in [RFC5512] is applicable to 
   the new BGP Tunnel Type code for VXLAN-gpe tunnel as well. No new 
   security risk is introduced by this new Tunnel Type code for them. 

5. IANA Considerations 

   A new BGP Tunnel Type code indicating the VXLAN-gpe tunnel type needs 
   to be assigned by IANA. 

6. Acknowledgements 

   Thanks to.
