Abstract

   This document describes how Kerberos Version 5 [1] is used with the
   telnet protocol.   It describes an telnet authentication suboption to
   be used with the telnet authentication option [2].   This mechanism
   can also used to provide keying material to provide data
   confidentiality services in conjunction with the telnet encryption
   option [3].  

   This document updates a previous specification of the Telnet
   Authentication Kerberos 5 method, RFC 2942 [4], to allow Kerberos 5
   Telnet authentication to be used in conjunction with the START_TLS
   option [5].

2.  Command Meanings

   IAC SB AUTHENTICATION IS <authentication-type-pair> AUTH 
   <KRB_AP_REQ message> IAC SE

      This is used to pass the Kerberos V5 [1] KRB_AP_REQ message to the
      remote side of the connection.  The first octet of the
      <authentication-type-pair> value is KERBEROS_V5, to indicate that
      Version 5 of Kerberos is being used.  

      The Kerberos V5 authenticator in the KRB_AP_REQ message must 
      contain a Kerberos V5 checksum of the two-byte authentication-type-
      pair.  If the ENCRYPT_START_TLS bit mask is in use, the checksum must 
      concatenate the TLS Client Finished Message and TLS Server Finished
      Message to the authentication-type-pair.  This checksum must be 
      verified by the server to assure that the authentication type pair
      was correctly negotiated.  

      The Kerberos V5 authenticator must also include the optional subkey
      field, which shall be filled in with a randomly chosen key.  This key
      shall be used for encryption purposes if encryption is negotiated,
      and shall be used as the negotiated session key (i.e., used as 
      keyid 0) for the purposes of the telnet encryption option; if the 
      subkey is not filled in, then the ticket session key will be used instead.

      If data confidentiality services is desired the ENCRYPT_US-
      ING_TELOPT flag must be set in the authentication-type-pair as
      specified in [2].

   IAC SB AUTHENTICATION REPLY <authentication-type-pair> ACCEPT IAC SE

      This command indicates that the authentication was successful.

      If the AUTH_HOW_MUTUAL bit is set in the second octet of the
      authentication-type-pair, the RESPONSE command must be sent before
      the ACCEPT command is sent.

   IAC SB AUTHENTICATION REPLY <authentication-type-pair> REJECT
      <optional reason for rejection> IAC SE

      This command indicates that the authentication was not successful,
      and if there is any more data in the sub-option, it is an ASCII
      text message of the reason for the rejection.

   IAC SB AUTHENTICATION REPLY <authentication-type-pair> RESPONSE
   <KRB_AP_REP message> IAC SE

      This command is used to perform mutual authentication.  It is only
      used when the AUTH_HOW_MUTUAL bit is set in the second octet of
      the authentication-type-pair.  After an AUTH command is verified,
      a RESPONSE command is sent which contains a Kerberos V5 KRB_AP_REP
      message to perform the mutual authentication.

   IAC SB AUTHENTICATION REPLY <authentication-type-pair> TLS_VERIFY
   MK_SAFE(<server TLS finished><client TLS finished>) IAC SE

      This command is used to verify that there is no man in the middle
      attack when a Kerberos 5 authentication is performed over a TLS
      protected session.  It is only used with AUTH_ENCRYPT_START_TLS
      is set.  If the client and server's finished messages cannot be
      verified, the connection MUST be terminated.  If this message is
      not received prior to the receipt of the ACCEPT message, the
      connection must be terminated.

   IAC SB AUTHENTICATION <authentication-type-pair> FORWARD <KRB_CRED
   message> IAC SE

      This command is used to forward kerberos credentials for use by
      the remote session.  The credentials are passed as a Kerberos V5
      KRB_CRED message which includes, among other things, the forwarded
      Kerberos ticket and a session key associated with the ticket.
      Part of the KRB_CRED message is encrypted in the key previously
      exchanged for the telnet session by the AUTH suboption.

   IAC SB AUTHENTICATION <authentication-type-pair> FORWARD_ACCEPT IAC
   SE

      This command indicates that the credential forwarding was
      successful.

   IAC SB AUTHENTICATION <authentication-type-pair> FORWARD_REJECT
      <optional reason for rejection> IAC SE

      This command indicates that the credential forwarding was not
      successful, and if there is any more data in the suboption, it is
      an ASCII text message of the reason for the rejection.

3.  Implementation Rules

   If the second octet of the authentication-type-pair has the AUTH_WHO
   bit set to AUTH_CLIENT_TO_SERVER, then the client sends the initial
   AUTH command, and the server responds with either ACCEPT or REJECT.
   In addition, if the AUTH_HOW bit is set to AUTH_HOW_MUTUAL, the
   server will send a RESPONSE before it sends the ACCEPT.

   If the second octet of the authentication-type-pair has the AUTH_WHO
   bit set to AUTH_SERVER_TO_CLIENT, then the server sends the initial
   AUTH command, and the client responds with either ACCEPT or REJECT.
   In addition, if the AUTH_HOW bit is set to AUTH_HOW_MUTUAL, the
   client will send a RESPONSE before it sends the ACCEPT.

   The Kerberos principal used by the server will generally be of the
   form "host/<hostname>@realm".  That is, the first component of the
   Kerberos principal is "host"; the second component is the fully
   qualified lower-case hostname of the server; and the realm is the
   Kerberos realm to which the server belongs.

   Any Telnet IAC characters that occur in the KRB_AP_REQ or KRB_AP_REP
   messages, the KRB_CRED structure, or the optional rejection text
   string must be doubled as specified in [4].  Otherwise the following
   byte might be mis-interpreted as a Telnet command.

4.  Examples

   User "joe" may wish to log in as user "pete" on machine "foo".  If
   "pete" has set things up on "foo" to allow "joe" access to his
   account, then the client would send IAC SB AUTHENTICATION NAME "pete"
   IAC SE IAC SB AUTHENTICATION IS KERBEROS_V5 AUTH <KRB_AP_REQ_MESSAGE>
   IAC SE

   The server would then authenticate the user as "joe" from the
   KRB_AP_REQ_MESSAGE, and if the KRB_AP_REQ_MESSAGE was accepted by
   Kerberos, and if "pete" has allowed "joe" to use his account, the
   server would then continue the authentication sequence by sending a
   RESPONSE (to do mutual authentication, if it was requested) followed
   by the ACCEPT.

   If forwarding has been requested, the client then sends IAC SB
   AUTHENTICATION IS KERBEROS_V5 CLIENT|MUTUAL FORWARD <KRB_CRED
   structure with credentials to be forwarded> IAC SE.  If the server
   succeeds in reading the forwarded credentials, the server sends
   FORWARD_ACCEPT else, a FORWARD_REJECT is sent back.

5. Security Considerations

   As an implementation of the TELNET AUTH option [2] all of the 
   Security Considerations from that RFC MUST be considered 
   applicable to this sub-option.

   The selection of the random session key in the Kerberos V5
   authenticator is critical, since this key will be used for encrypting
   the telnet data stream if encryption is enabled.  It is strongly
   advised that the random key selection be done using cryptographic
   techniques that involve the Kerberos ticket's session key.  For
   example, using the current time, encrypting it with the ticket
   session key, and then correcting for key parity is a strong way to
   generate a subsession key, since the ticket session key is assumed to
   be never disclosed to an attacker.

   Care should be taken before forwarding a user's Kerberos credentials
   to the remote server.  If the remote server is not trustworthy, this
   could result in the user's credentials being compromised.  Hence, the
   user interface should not forward credentials by default; it would be
   far safer to either require the user to explicitly request
   credentials forwarding for each connection, or to have a trusted list
   of hosts for which credentials forwarding is enabled, but to not
   enable credentials forwarding by default for all machines.

   This mechanism does not include all of the telnet authentication 
   negotiation exchanges in the integrity checksum as recommended in [2].  
   This means that the selection of this option is vulnerable to downgrade
   attacks when multiple authentication type pairs are offered by the
   server.

   The IAC SB AUTHENTICATION NAME name IAC SE message is unprotected
   in the AUTH option and it is not verified by the AUTH KRB5 suboption.
   The name MUST be verified by a secure method after authentication 
   completes before it is used to access authorization information or
   perform a login.  One method of verification is for the server to 
   request the client to transmit the desired name using the 
   TELNET NEW-ENVIRONMENT option [6].  This can be accomplished by 
   sending the message after authentication and encryption activation
   completes:
     IAC SB NEW-ENVIRONMENT SEND VAR USER IAC SE
   The client's response should include the same name that was transmitted
   as part of the IAC SB AUTHENTICATION NAME name IAC SE message.

6. IANA Considerations

   The authentication type KERBEROS_V5 and its associated suboption
   values are registered with IANA.  Any suboption values used to extend
   the protocol as described in this document must be registered with
   IANA before use.  IANA is instructed not to issue new suboption
   values without submission of documentation of their use.
