Internet-Draft      IMAP4 Server-Initiated LOGOUT            June 2011 
        

   The Internet Message Access Protocol [RFC3501] requires a client to 
   initiate a LOGOUT command to close the network connection. However, 
   it's often desirable to have the server initiate the termination of 
   the network connection. This allows the network to deactivate a 
   service provided to a client. This document specifies the syntax of a 
   server-initiated LOGOUT command, which will allow a server to tell 
   the client that the connection needs to be closed.

1. Introduction 

   In some situations, the network may need to deactivate a service 
   provided to a client. However, according to the current Internet 
   Message Access Protocol, Version 4rev1 (IMAP4rev1) [RFC3501], only a 
   client is allowed to originate the deactivation of an IMAP4rev1-based 
   service by sending a LOGOUT command to the server. This document 
   introduces a LOGOUT command sent out by a server. With this command, 
   a server is able to initiate the closing of a network connection when 
   necessary. This command informs the client of the server's intent to 
   close the connection so that the client will not regard the 
   disconnection as a malfunction when the server closes the connection. 

2. Conventions used in this document 

   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and 
   server respectively. 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].  

   In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation   
   only when in ALL CAPS. Lower case uses of these words are not to be    
   interpreted as carrying RFC-2119 significance.

3. Specification 

   LOGOUT Command (initiated by the server) 

   Arguments:  none 

   Responses:  OPTIONAL untagged response: BYE 

   Result:     OK - logout completed 
               BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid 

   A server sends a LOGOUT command to a client to inform the client that 
   the server needs to close the network connection. The client MAY send 
   a BYE untagged response before the (tagged) OK response. In order to 
   handle the case where a LOGOUT command can never trigger a final 
   response, a timer is implemented in the server. When a LOGOUT command 
   is sent to a client, the timer MUST be set for that particular 
   client. The timer MUST have a timing interval longer than 32 seconds.
   The server SHALL close the connection when it receives the OK
   response from the client or the timer expires. 

   Example:    S: A001 LOGOUT 
               C: * BYE IMAP4rev1 Client logging out 
               C: A001 OK LOGOUT completed 
               (Server and client then close the connection) 

4. Security Considerations 

   There are no known security issues with this extension. 

5. IANA Considerations
