    Abstract 

       This document describes the use of the ARIA block cipher algorithm 
       in the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) for providing    
       confidentiality for the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) traffic    
       and for the control traffic for RTP, the Real-time Transport Control   
       Protocol (RTCP).  

        

    1. Introduction 

       This document describes the use of the ARIA [RFC5794] block cipher       
       algorithm in the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) [RFC3711] 
       for providing confidentiality for the Real-time Transport Protocol       
       (RTP) [RFC3550] traffic and for the control traffic for RTP, the       
       Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP) [RFC3550]. 

    1.1. ARIA 

       ARIA is a general-purpose block cipher algorithm developed by Korean 
       cryptographers in 2003. It is an iterated block cipher with 128-, 
       192-, and 256-bit keys and encrypts 128-bit blocks in 12, 14, and 16 
       rounds, depending on the key size. It is secure and suitable for 
       most software and hardware implementations on 32-bit and 8-bit 
       processors. It was established as a Korean standard block cipher 
       algorithm in 2004 [ARIAKS] and has been widely used in Korea, 
       especially for government-to-public services. It was included in 
       PKCS #11 in 2007 [ARIAPKCS]. The algorithm specification and object 
       identifiers are described in [RFC5794].

       "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this   
       document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

    2. Cryptographic Transforms 

       All symmetric block cipher algorithms share common characteristics 
       including mode, key size, weak keys, and block size. The following 
       sections contain descriptions of the relevant characteristics of 
       ARIA. 

       ARIA does not have any restrictions for modes of operation that are 
       used with this block cipher. We define three modes of running ARIA, 
       (1) ARIA in Counter Mode, (2) ARIA in Counter with CBC-MAC (CCM) 
       Mode and (3) ARIA in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) Mode. 

    2.1. Counter 

       Section 4.1.1 of [RFC3711] defines AES counter mode encryption, 
       which it refers to as AES-CM. ARIA counter mode is defined in a 
       similar manner, and is denoted as ARIA-CTR. The plaintext inputs to 
       the block cipher are formed as in AES-CM, and the block cipher 
       outputs are processed as in AES-CM. The only difference in the 
       processing is that ARIA-CTR uses ARIA as the underlying encryption 
       primitive. When ARIA-CTR is used, it MUST be used only in 
       conjunction with an authentication function. 

    2.1.1. Message Authentication/Integrity: HMAC-SHA1 

       HMAC-SHA1 [RFC2104], as defined in section 4.2.1 of [RFC3711], SHALL 
       be the default message authentication code to be used with ARIA-CTR. 
       The default session authentication key-length SHALL be 160 bits, the 
       default authentication tag length SHALL be 80 bits, and the 
       SRTP_PREFIX_LENGTH SHALL be zero for HMAC-SHA1. For SRTP, smaller 
       values are NOT RECOMMENDED, but MAY be used after careful 
       consideration of the issues in section 7.5 and 9.5 of [RFC3711]. 

    2.2. Counter with CBC-MAC (CCM) 

       CCM is a generic authenticate-and-encrypt block cipher mode 
       [RFC3610]. In this specification, CCM used with the ARIA block   
       cipher is denoted as ARIA-CCM. Section 3.3 of [RFC3711] defines 
       procedures to construct or to authenticate and decrypt SRTP packets. 
       For ARIA-CCM however, the sender performs Step 7 before Step 5 and 
       the receiver performs the second half of Step 5 (performs 
       verification) after Step 6. This means that authentication is 
       performed on the plaintext rather than the ciphertext. This applies 
       equally to SRTCP 

       All SRTP packets MUST be authenticated and encrypted. Unlike SRTP, 
       SRTCP packet encryption is optional (but authentication is 
     
     
    Kim et al.            Expires December 9, 2010                [Page 3] 
        
    Internet-Draft                ARIA-SRTP                   June 9, 2010 
        

       mandatory). A sender can select which packets to encrypt, and 
       indicates this choice with a 1-bit encryption flag (located in the 
       leftmost bit of the 32-bit word that contains the SRTCP index). 

       ARIA-CCM has two parameters: 

         M   M indicates the size of the authentication tag. In SRTP, a           
             full 80-bit authentication-tag SHOULD be used and 
             implementation of this specification MUST support M values of           
             10 octets. 

         L   L indicates the size of the length field in octets. The number 
             of octets in the nonce MUST be 12, i.e., L is 3. 

       ARIA-CCM has four inputs: 

         Key 

             A single key is used to calculate the authentication tag using 
             CBC-MAC and to perform payload encryption using counter mode. 
             ARIA only supports a key size of 128 bits. 

         Nonce 

             The size of the nonce depends on the value selected for the 
             parameter L. It is 15-L octets. L equals 3 and hence the nonce          
             size equals 12 octets. 

         Plaintext 

             In case of SRTP, the payload of the RTP packet and the RTP 
             padding and RTP pad count field (if the latter two fields are 
             present). 

             In case of SRTCP, when the encryption flag is set to 1, the 
             Encrypted Portion described in Fig.2 of [RFC3711] is treated as         
             plaintext. When the encryption flag is set to 0, the plaintext 
             is zero-length. 

         Additional Authentication Data (AAD) 

             In case of SRTP, the header of the RTP packet including 
             contributing source (CSRC) identifier (if present) and the RTP 
             header extension (if present).  

             In case of SRTCP, when the encryption flag is set to 0, the 
             Authentication Portion described in Fig.2 of [RFC3711] is

             treated as AAD. When the encryption flag is set to 1, the first 
             8-octets, the encryption flag and SRTCP index are treated as 
             AAD. 

         ARIA-CCM accepts these four inputs and returns a ciphertext field. 

    2.3. Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) 

       GCM is a block cipher mode of operation providing both 
       confidentiality and data origin authentication [GCM]. GCM used with 
       the ARIA block cipher is denoted as ARIA-GCM. 

       ARIA-GCM has four inputs: a key, a plaintext, a nonce and the 
       additional authenticated data (AAD) all described in section 2.2. 

       The bit length of the tag, denoted t, is 12, and an authentication 
       tag with a length of 12 octets (96 bits) is used. 

    3. Nonce Format for CCM and GCM 

    3.1. Nonce for SRTP 

       The nonce for SRTP SHALL be formed in the following way: 

            Nonce = (16 bits of zeroes || SSRC || ROC || SEQ) XOR Salt 

       The 4-octet SSRC and the 2-octet SEQ SHALL be taken from the RTP 
       header. The 4-octet ROC is from the cryptographic context. The 12-   
       octet Salt SHALL be produced by the SRTP Key Derivation Function. 

    3.2. Nonce for SRTCP 

       The nonce for SRTCP SHALL be formed in the following way: 

             Nonce = (16 bits of zeroes || SSRC || 16 bits of zeroes || 
                       SRTCP index) XOR Salt 

       The 4-octet SSRC SHALL be taken from the RTCP header and the 31-bit 
       SRTCP index (packed zero-filled, right justified into a 4-octet 
       field) is from each packet. The 12-octet Salt SHALL be produced by 
       the SRTP Key Derivation Function. 

    4. Key Derivation: ARIA-CTR PRF 

       Section 4.3.3 of [RFC3711] defines the AES-128 counter mode key    
       derivation function, which it refers to as "AES-CM PRF". The ARIA-

       CTR PRF is defined in a similar manner, but with each invocation of 
       AES replaced with an invocation of ARIA. 

       The currently defined PRF, keyed by the 128-bit master key, has 
       input block size m = 128 and can produce n-bit outputs for n up to 
       2^23. ARIA-PRF_n(k_master, x) SHALL be ARIA in Counter Mode as 
       described in section 2.1, applied to key k_master, and IV equal to 
       (x*2^16), and with the output keystream truncated to the n first 
       (left-most) bits. 

    5. Mandatory-to-implement Transforms 

       "Mandatory-to-implement" means conformance to the specification, and    
       that Table 1 does not supersede a similar table in section 5 of 
       [RFC3711]. An RTP implementation that supports ARIA MUST implement   
       the modes listed in Table 1. 

                               mandatory-to-implement      optional

       Table 1: Mandatory-to-implement and optional transforms in SRTP and    
       SRTCP. 

    6. Security Considerations 

       At the time of writing this document no security problem has been 
       found on ARIA (see [ARIAEVAL]). 

       The security considerations in [RFC3711] apply to this document as 
       well. 

       See [RFC3610] and [GCM] for security considerations regarding the 
       CCM and GCM modes of operations, respectively. 

    7. IANA Considerations 

       [RFC4568] defines SRTP "crypto suites". In order to allow SDP to 
       signal the use of the algorithms defined in this document, IANA will 
       register the following crypto suites into the subregistry for SRTP 
       crypto suites under the SRTP transport of the SDP Security 
       Descriptions: 

          srtp-crypto-suite-ext = "ARIA_CTR_128_HMAC_SHA1_80"/
