Abstract

   This document provides the problem statement requirements and
   scenarios for MIF.  These requirements and use case scenarios are
   intended to define an approach to solving common problems presented

Internet-Draft   MIF Problem Requirements and Scenarios        July 2009


   in MIF.  These MIF requirements and scenarios are based around the
   common and prevalent problem of adaptation of a host to attach to
   multiple networks simultaneously.  Such a host not only has to make
   decisions about selection of service parameters but also how to deal
   with issues relating to contradictory configuration objects.  These
   MIF scenarios are intended to be part of a set of such scenarios that
   together define the purpose, scope and requirements for proposed and
   realized capabilities.


1.  Introduction

   Currently most of the network hosts (such as mobile phones, note PCs,
   etc) are equipped with multiple interfaces physically or virtually.
   The interfaces may connect with same or different network domains.
   Such scenarios result in connectivity issues as configuration
   information may be local to the interface or global to the node.
   Various issues arise when multiple configuration parameters are
   global to the node are received on the many interfaces the multihomed
   host has.

   When a host has multiple network connections, problems arise within
   the network stack.  Such hosts receive configuration parameters from
   multiple sources, such as from any set of default routers, DHCP
   servers, and manual configurations.  Questions of how are conflicting
   parameters for host or interface configuration reconciled with each
   other, or, if not reconcilable, which parameters have precedence?
   Hosts with multiple interfaces are more likely to be confronted with
   this issue, but the issue may also come up for hosts with a single
   interface.

   It is important therefore to detail the various scenarios cases to
   provide a framework for understanding the implications on problem
   statement requirements for defining the appropriate behavior of an
   IPv4 or IPv6 stack and what protocols would be to manage these cases.
   Below these scenarios are enumerated.  They will help in
   understanding better the requirements and implications for solutions
   to these requirements.


2.  Problem Statement Requirements

   The MIF problem statement requirements are enumerated as:

2.1.  General Requirements

   o  R0 - MIF must work with both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.  Any of
      these combinations of addresses must be supported.  For example,



Williams & Qin           Expires January 7, 2010                [Page 2]

Internet-Draft   MIF Problem Requirements and Scenarios        July 2009


      one network connection may be IPv4 and another IPv6.

   o  R1 - MIF must support one or more network interfaces which can be
      physical, logical or virtual.

   o  R2 - Network configuration parameters may come from different
      administrative domains.  MIF must be able to handle network
      connection services that may be administered by different
      organizations.  In some deployments, the network services may not
      be administered by the same organization or people, such as in a
      community wireless environment.  This poses challenges for the
      host to have consistency of data offered by network connection
      services.

   o  R3 - MIF solution must be compatible with existing IPv4, IPv6
      architecture and protocols.

   o  R4 - MIF does not require to support IP mobility management
      protocols (e.g.  MIPv6, MIPv4) and is not part of the problem
      scope.

   o  R5 - MIF must support the ability of communication to happen
      simultaneously or independently over multiple network connections.

2.2.  Requirements on merging of IP layer autoconfiguration

   o  R6 - MIF must be capable of collecting the global/local
      configuration objects from different interfaces.

   o  R7 - MIF must support specific policies to merge the configuration
      objects when they are conflicting

   o  R8 - MIF must provide the way to users/network to exchange the
      policies for merging of configurations

   o  R9 - MIF node must provide the way to update the configurations.

2.3.  Split DNS

   o  R10 - MIF must be able to get DNS services from different
      networks.

   o  R11 - MIF must be configured with policies for DNS service access.

   o  R12 - MIF must provide the way to users/network to change the
      policies for DNS access.

   o  R13 - MIF must provide the way to update the policies of DNS
      service access.


3.  Scenarios for Multi-interfaced Hosts

   The MIF work is looking at a multi-homed host whereby it receives
   node configuration information from each of its access networks.
   This section enumerates scenarios of multi-homed hosts so that
   analysis can be made to the problem goals of the IETF work.

   Combinations of the above - configurations with both multiple network
   interfaces and multiple IP addresses assigned to some or all of these
   interfaces - are also possible.

3.1.  Sets of services are the same

   Here the host has two or more unlimited Internet Connections.  The
   sets of services for these connections are the same.

       A and B are Internet connections both having the same set of
                                 services.

                                 (     A, B      )

                                 Figure 1

3.2.  Set of services are different

   Next on the list of complexity is the scenario case a host has
   multiple Internet connections but the set of services for these are
   different.  Here the host for example may have a physical and/or
   logical VPN connection to different private networks and services.
   Another example is connecting a host to 2 logically separate but
   physically connected networks.  In this case a host has one Internet
   connection and one VPN connection through which only private network
   and services can be reached.

   overlapping.

3.4.  Inclusion of a set of services

   In this usage scenario services provided by one network the host
   connects to are completely included by the provision of another.  For
   example, the host has one Internet connection and one VPN connection,
   while it can also access the Internet services through NATs and
   proxies provided in the VPN besides some private services.

                                 Figure 4

3.5.  Combination of services

   A realistic scenario is the combination of the above mentioned
   scenarios.  A multi-homed host has multiple network interfaces both
   physical and logical.  If the host has all physical connections, the
   host may be connected to different networks through various ways, for
   instance, wired LAN, 802.11 LAN or a 3G cellular network.  For the
   case that multiple interfaces on the same network, connection issues
   should be handled by lower-layer protocols, the MIF focuses on upper-
   layer routing and service reachability.  If there is one logical
   connection the host may have logical connections built on its
   physical connection, this may be handled by some third-party tools.
   While the data forwarding process needs to be defined further such as
   in a BCP document.


4.  Implication of usage scenarios on Multi-homed requirements

   Analysis of these case scenarios will enable a more meaningful
   perspective on the requirement solution space.  Requirement
   implications include:

   o  The host with multiple network interfaces must be able to handle
      configuration information that may be gathered from multiple
      sources.

   o  The host must be able handle per-node and per-interface settings.
      Per interface settings can be complex because a client node needs
      to know from which interface system settings came from.  And it
      may not be apparent which setting should be used, if e.g. if the
      service setting is received on multiple interfaces, potentially
      over different protocols.

   o  The host must be able to handle network connection services that
      may be administered by different organizations.  In some



Williams & Qin           Expires January 7, 2010                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft   MIF Problem Requirements and Scenarios        July 2009


      deployments, the network services may not be administered by the
      same organization or people, such as in a community wireless
      environment.  This poses problems for consistency of data offered
      by network connection services.

   o  Mutli-interface fixed nodes may start, stop and dynamically change
      flows and connection status.  The host must be able to handle
      these dynamic changes that may be both host wide as well as
      interface specific.  In addition, the host must be able to handle
      protocol startup sequence that may result from such changes.

   o  Different requirements of different applications can result in a
      different preference of the interface (physical or logical) that
      should be used.  Network connections should be placed in the best
      possible interface based on these requirements.  A fixed node
      should not only be enabled to connect to different networks
      simultaneously but also based on policies be able to dynamically
      assign desired flows to the best interface.


5.  Related IETF Works

5.1.  Relationship with current internet hosts (RFC1122)

   [RFC1122] specified the requirements on the internet host softwares
   related to link layer, IP layer, and transport layer.  MIF will not
   change the basic routing policies of outbound packets in [RFC1122].
   As for multihoming support, if the datagram is sent in response to a
   received datagram, MIF will also select the source address for the
   response SHOULD be the specific-destination address of the request,
   which is the same as the definition of [RFC1122].  Otherwise, more
   rules will be provided by MIF besides the specified rules to select
   the source addresses.  The rules of MIF are applicable for both
   strong and weak end systems (ES).  In MIF, An application is not
   required to explicitly specify the source address for initiating a
   connection or a request.

5.2.  Network Discovery and Selection Problem (RFC5113)

   [RFC5113] defines the ways to help users to select which network to
   connect to and how to authenticate with that network, when multiple
   access networks are available.  Basically, it divides the problems of
   network discovery and selection into multiple sub- problems,
   including Discovery of Points of Attachment, Identity Selection, AAA
   Routing, Network Capabilities Discovery, etc.  Some constraints on
   potential solutions are outlined, and the limitations of several
   solutions (including existing ones) are discussed as well.  In
   [RFC5113], the routing of data packets, in the situation where



Williams & Qin           Expires January 7, 2010                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft   MIF Problem Requirements and Scenarios        July 2009


   mechanisms more advanced than destination-based routing are thought
   to be necessary.  But, it explicitly specified that payload routings
   not discussed further in [RFC5113] .  MIF will have solution for this
   issue.  MIF will rely on [RFC5113] for network discovery and
   selection.  Before the MIF works for routing/configuration/split DNS,
   the network discovery and attachment must be finished beforehand by
   way of [RFC5113] .  In this sense, MIF will not cover the network
   selection and discovery at all.

5.3.   PMIPv6 & Monami6

   As discussed in early section, the solutions of both multihoming
   support in MEXT and NetLMM need the support from Home Agent (HA) or
   Local Mobility Anchor (LMA).  MIF will work on multiple interfaces
   solutions of generic simple IP model.  Furthermore, from an IP
   perspective, there is only a single interface with PMIPv6 and any
   network changes happen within the network.  However, some experiences
   in these working groups will be good references in MIF as well.

5.4.  Default address selection (RFC3484)

   [RFC3484] proposed default address selection and destination address
   for IPv6 could be a reference to MIF work.  On-going work is being
   done with issues of default address selection in
   [I-D.chown-addr-select-considerations]

5.5.  Site Multi-homing of IPv6 (SHIM6)

   SHIM6 provides multi-homed site with a new sub-layer (shim) into the
   IP stack of end-system hosts, for the purposes of redundancy, load
   sharing, operational policy or cost.  It will enable hosts on multi-
   homed sites to use a set of provider-assigned IP address prefixes and
   switch between them without upsetting transport protocols or
   applications.  It's different from MIF in the following two items:

   o  SHIM6 only schedules the interfaces for the purposes of
      redundancy, load sharing, etc.

   o  SHIM6 is more on switching the prefixes without the involvement of
      transport protocols or applications. o SHIM6 assumes the
      configuration of multiple interfaces has been done beforehand.
      MIF will work on the reconciliation of these configuration
      objects.

6.  Security Considerations

   MIF must have the security capabilities to protect MIF node from any
   malicious attempts caused by security holes such as denial of service
   attacks.  The MIF solution must not compromise the security
   architecture of the basic IPv4/IPv6 networks.  MIF is required to
   provide an admission control mechanism to regulate any MIF events.
   MIF could rely on the security mechanism of each interface on MIF
   node.  Mechanisms used by MIF to exchange policies MUST support
   security feature to protect this flow of information.

   This document doesn't intend to provide the MIF security analysis but
   one will be required.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no requests to IANA.
