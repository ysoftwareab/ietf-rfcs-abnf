1. Introduction

   ISUP defines a Calling Party's Category (CPC) parameter that
   characterizes the station used to originate a call and carries other
   important state that can describe the originating party.  When
   telephone numbers are contained in URLs, such as the tel URL, it may
   be desirable to communicate any CPC associated with that telephone
   number or, in the context of a call, the party calling from it.

   Note that in some networks (including North America), the Originating
   Line Information (OLI) parameter is used to carry this information in
   ISUP rather than the CPC parameter.  Legacy multifrequency (MF)
   signaling networks carry this information in the ANI II Digits.

2. Parameter Definition

   The Calling Party's Category is represented as a tel URL parameter.
   The ABNF syntax is as follows:

      cpc                   = cpc-tag "=" cpc-value
      cpc-tag               = "rn"
      cpc-value             = string

   CPC values (``cpc-value'' strings) must be registered with IANA.  The
   following values are pre-registered by this document:

    ordinary: The caller has been identified, and has no special
      features.

    priority: This call has priority/emergency status.

    data: This call will contain voice-band data.

    test: This is a test call that has been originated as part of a
      maintenance procedure.

    operator: The call was generated by an operator position.

    payphone: The calling station is a payphone.

    prison: The calling station is in a prison.

    unknown: The CPC could not be ascertained.

   An example of the syntax of the CPC parameter (in a small fragment of
   a SIP message) is given below:

           INVITE sip:bob@biloxi.com SIP/2.0
           To: "Bob" <sip:bob@biloxi.com>
           From: <tel:+17005554141;cpc=payphone>;tag=1928301774

3. Usage

   The CPC is generally useful only when describing the originator of a
   telephone call.  Therefore, when this parameter is used in an
   application such as SIP, it is recommended that the parameter be
   applied to URLs that characterize the originator of a call (such as a
   SIP URI or tel URL in the From header field of a SIP message).

   It is anticipated that this URL will be used primarily by gateways
   that interwork ISUP networks with SIP networks.  Various SIP network
   intermediaries might consult the CPC as they make routing decisions,
   although no specific behavior is prescribed in this document.  While
   no specific mapping of the various ISUP parameters that contain CPC
   data is offered in this document, creating such a mapping would be
   trivial.

   If the CPC parameter is not present, consumers of the CPC should
   treat the URL as if it specified a CPC of "unknown".

   Generally, only one instance of the CPC will be associated with a
   particular URL.

4. Security Considerations

   The information contained in the CPC parameter may be of a private
   nature, and it may not be appropriate for this value to be revealed
   to the destination user (typically it would not be so revealed in the
   PSTN).

   Otherwise, this mechanism adds no new security considerations to
   those discussed in RFC2806 [1].

5. IANA Considerations

   This document requests the creation of an IANA registry for Calling
   Party's Category values.  The values of the CPC parameter in use in
   ISUP are unfortunately quite specific to national networks, and thus
   it is very difficult to uncover all the usages that may be in place
   in various networks.  Note that in North American networks, the
   Originating Line Information parameter contains information common
   found in the Calling Party's Category elsewhere; it is therefore
   legitimate to register values associated with the Originating Line
   Information in this registry.

   In order to file a registration, interested parties must contact IANA
   and supply them with both a new ``cpc-value'' and a short reason
   phrase describing the usage of the new CPC.  Some values are given in
   Section 2; we ask that these values be pre-registered upon
   publication of this document as an RFC.  It is not expected that this
   registry will require any expert supervision.
