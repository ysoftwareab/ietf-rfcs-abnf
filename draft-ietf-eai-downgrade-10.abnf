   Encapsulating a header field in a "Downgraded-" header field is
   defined as:
   1.  Generate new "Downgraded-" header field whose value is the
       original header field value.
   2.  Treat the generated header field content as if it were
       unstructured, and then apply [RFC2047] encoding with charset
       UTF-8 as necessary so the result is ASCII.
   3.  Remove the original header field.

   Applying this procedure to "Received" header field is prohibited.
