               EAP-based Authentication Service for CoAP
                     draft-ietf-ace-wg-coap-eap-04

Abstract

   This document specifies an authentication service that uses the
   Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) transported employing
   Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) messages.  As such, it
   defines an EAP lower layer based on CoAP called CoAP-EAP.  One of the
   primer goals is to authenticate a CoAP-enabled IoT device (EAP peer)
   that intends to join a security domain managed by a Controller (EAP
   authenticator).  Secondly, it allows deriving key material to protect
   CoAP messages exchanged between them based on Object Security for
   Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE), enabling the establishment
   of a security association between them.

1.  Introduction

   This document specifies an authentication service (application) that
   uses the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) [RFC3748] and is
   built on top of the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) [RFC7252]
   called CoAP-EAP.  CoAP-EAP is an application that allows
   authenticating two CoAP endpoints by using EAP, and to establish an
   Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE)
   security association between them.

   More specifically, this document specifies how CoAP can be used as a
   constrained, link-layer independent, reliable EAP lower layer
   [RFC3748] to transport EAP messages between a CoAP server (acting as
   EAP peer) and a CoAP client (acting as EAP authenticator) using CoAP
   messages.  The CoAP client has the option of contacting a backend AAA
   infrastructure to complete the EAP negotiation as described in the
   EAP specification [RFC3748].

   EAP methods transported in CoAP MUST generate cryptographic material
   [RFC5247] for this specification.  This way, CoAP messages are
   protected after the authentication.  After CoAP-EAP's operation, an
   OSCORE security association is established between endpoints of the
   service.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] [RFC8174]
   when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

   Readers are expected to be familiar with the terms and concepts of
   described in CoAP [RFC7252], EAP [RFC3748] and OSCORE [RFC8613].

2.  General Architecture

   Figure 1 illustrates the architecture defined in this document.
   Basically, an IoT device, acting as the EAP peer, wants to be
   authenticated by using EAP to join a domain that is managed by a
   Controller acting as EAP authenticator.  The IoT device will act a
   CoAP server for this service, and the EAP authenticator as a CoAP
   client.  The rationale behind this decision, as expanded later, is
   that EAP requests go always from the EAP server to the EAP peer.
   Accordingly, the EAP responses go from the EAP peer to the EAP
   server.

   It is worth noting that the CoAP client (EAP authenticator) MAY
   interact with a backend AAA infrastructure when EAP pass-through mode
   is used, which will place the EAP server in the AAA server that
   contains the information required to authenticate the EAP peer.

3.  CoAP-EAP Operation

   CoAP-EAP uses reliable delivery in CoAP ([RFC7252],[RFC8323]).
   Therefore, EAP retransmission time is set to infinite as mentioned in
   [RFC3748].  To keep ordering guarantee, CoAP-EAP uses Hypermedia as
   the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS).  In particular, each step
   during the EAP authentication is represented as a new resource in the
   EAP peer (CoAP server).  The previous resource is removed once the
   new resource is created indicating the resource that will process the
   next expected step of the EAP authentication.

   It is assumed that any EAP method that exports cryptographic material
   is valid.  For example, EAP-MD5 cannot be used since it does not
   export key material.  It is RECOMMENDED a light EAP method for the
   case of constrained link and constrained IoT devices.

Internet-Draft                  CoAP-EAP                    October 2021


   In CoAP-EAP, the IoT device (EAP peer/CoAP server) will only have one
   authentication session with a specific Controller (EAP authenticator/
   CoAP client) and it will not process any other EAP authentication in
   parallel (with the same Controller).  That is, a single ongoing EAP
   authentication is permitted for the same IoT device and same
   Controller.  Moreover, EAP is a lock-step protocol ([RFC3748]).  The
   article [eap-framework], highlights the benefits of the EAP
   framework.

   To access the authentication service, this document defines the well-
   known URI "/.well-known/coap-eap" (to be assigned by IANA).  This URI
   is referring to the authentication service that is present in the
   Controller so that IoT device can start the service.

3.1.  Discovery

   Prior to the CoAP-EAP exchange takes place, the IoT device needs to
   discovers the Controller or the entity that will enable the exchange
   between the IoT and the Controller (e.g., an intermediary such as a
   proxy).

   The discovery process is out of scope of this document.  This
   document provides the specification using the mechanisms provided by
   CoAP to discover the Controller for CoAP-EAP.

   The CoAP-EAP application is designated by the well-known URI "coap-
   eap" for the trigger message (Step 0).  The CoAP-EAP service can be
   discovered by asking directly the services offered.  This information
   can be also available in the resource directory.

   Implementation Notes: On the methods on how the IPv6 address of the
   Controller or intermediary entity can be discovered, there can be
   different methods depending on the specific deployment.  For example,
   on a 6LoWPAN network, the Border Router will typically act as the
   Controller, hence after receiving the Router Advertisement (RA)
   messages from the Border Router, the IoT device may engage on the
   CoAP-EAP exchange.  Different protocols can be used to discover the
   IP of the Controller.  Example of this protocols are Multicast DNS
   (mDNS) [RFC6762] or DHCPv6 [RFC8415].

3.2.  Flow of operation (OSCORE establishment)

   Figure 2 shows the general flow of operation for CoAP-EAP to
   authenticate using EAP and establish an OSCORE security context.  The
   flow does not show a specific EAP method.  Instead we represent the
   chosen EAP method by using a generic name (EAP-X).  The flow assumes
   that the IoT device knows the Controller implements the CoAP-EAP
   service.  The specific mechanism of discovery is out-of-scope of this

   document.  Some comments about Controller discovery is in
   Section 3.1.

   The steps for the operation happens as follows:

   *  Step 0.  The IoT device MUST start the authentication process by
      sending a "POST /.well-known/coap-eap" request (trigger message).
      This message carries the 'No-Response' [RFC7967] CoAP option to
      avoid waiting for a response that is not needed.  This message is
      the only instance where the Controller acts as a CoAP server and
      the IoT device as a CoAP client.  The message also includes an URI
      in the payload of the message to indicate to what resource (e.g.
      '/a/x') the Controller MUST send the first message with the EAP
      authentication.  The name of the resource is selected by the CoAP
      server as it pleases.  After this, the exchange continues with the
      Controller as a CoAP client and the IoT device as a CoAP server.

   *  Step 1.  The Controller sends a "POST" message to the resource
      indicated by the IoT device in the Step 0 (e.g. '/a/x').  The
      payload in this message contains the first EAP message (EAP
      Request/Identity), the Sender ID for OSCORE selected by the
      Controller and it MAY contain a CBOR array containing a list with
      the ciphersuites (CS) for OSCORE.  If the ciphersuite is not
      included the default ciphersuite for OSCORE is used.  The details
      of the ciphersuite negotiation are discussed in Section 5.1.

   *  Step 2.  The IoT device processes the POST message by passing the
      EAP request (EAP-Req/Id) to the EAP peer state machine, which
      returns an EAP response (EAP Resp/Id); it assigns a new resource
      to the ongoing authentication process (e.g. '/a/y'), and deletes
      the previous one ('/a/x').  It finally sends a '2.01 Created'
      response with the new resource identifier in the Location-Path
      (and/or Location-Query) options for the next step; the EAP
      response, the Recipient ID and the selected ciphersuite for OSCORE
      are in the payload.  In this step, the IoT device MAY create a
      OSCORE security context with the Sender ID and Recipient ID.  The
      required key, the Master Session Key (MSK), will be available once
      the EAP authentication is successful.

   *  Step 3-6.  From now on, the Controller and the IoT device will
      exchange EAP packets related to the EAP method (EAP-X),
      transported in the CoAP message payload.  The Controller will use
      the POST method to send EAP requests to the IoT device.  The IoT
      device will use a response to carry the EAP response in the
      payload.  EAP requests and responses are represented in Figure 2
      using the nomenclature (EAP-X-Req and EAP-X-Resp, respectively.
      When a POST message arrives (e.g, '/a/x') carrying an EAP request
      message, if processed correctly by the EAP peer state machine,



Marin-Lopez & Garcia-CarriExpires 28 April 2022                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                  CoAP-EAP                    October 2021


      returns an EAP Response.  Along with each EAP Response, a new
      resource is created (e.g, '/a/z') for processing the next EAP
      request and the ongoing resource (e.g., '/a/y') is erased.  This
      way ordering guarantee is achieved.  Finally EAP response is sent
      in the payload of a CoAP response that will also indicate the new
      resource in the Location-Path (and/or Location-Query) Options.  In
      case there is an error processing a legitimate message, the server
      will return an (4.00 Bad Request).  There is a discussion about
      error handling in Section 3.5.

   *  Step 7.  When the EAP authentication ends with success, the
      Controller obtains the Master Session Key (MSK) exported by the
      EAP method, an EAP Success message and some authorization
      information (i.e. session lifetime) [RFC5247].  The Controller
      creates the OSCORE security context using the MSK and Sender ID
      and Recipient ID exchanged in Step 1 and 2.  The establishment of
      the OSCORE Security Context is defined in Section 5.2.  Then, the
      Controller sends the POST message protected with OSCORE for key
      confirmation including the EAP Success.  The Controller MAY also
      send a Session Lifetime, in seconds, which is represented with an
      unsigned integer in a CBOR object (see Section 4.  If this Session
      Lifetime is not sent, the IoT device assumes a default value of 8
      hours as RECOMMENDED in [RFC5247].  The reception of the POST
      message protected with OSCORE using the Sender ID sent in Step 1
      is considered by the IoT device as an alternate indication of
      success ([RFC3748]).  The EAP peer state machine in the IoT device
      interprets the alternate indication of success similarly the
      arrival of an EAP Success and returns the MSK, which is used for
      the OSCORE security context in the IoT device to process the
      protected POST message received from the Controller.

   *  Step 8.  The IoT Device answers with '2.04 Changed' if the EAP
      authentication is a success and the verification of the "POST"
      protected with OSCORE in Step 7 is correctly verified.  The
      communication with the last resource (e.g. '/a/w') from this point
      MUST be protected with OSCORE except during a new
      (re)authentication (see Section 3.3).

3.3.  Reauthentication

   When the CoAP-EAP state is close to expire, the IoT device MAY want
   to start a re-authentication process to renew the state.  Since the
   initial authentication is usually taxing, it is assumed to be done
   only once over a long period of time (e.g. based on Session-
   Lifetime).  Certain EAP methods such as EAP-NOOB
   [I-D.ietf-emu-eap-noob] or EAP-AKA' [RFC5448] provides fast reconnect
   for quicker re-authentication.  The EAP re-authentication protocol

   (ERP) [RFC6696] MAY be also used for avoiding the repetition of the
   entire EAP exchange.

   The message flow for the reauthentication will be exactly the same as
   the one shown in Figure 2.  Nevertheless, two different CoAP-EAP
   states will be active during the re-authentication: the current CoAP-
   EAP state and the new CoAP-EAP state, which will be created once the
   reauthentication has finished with success.  Once the
   reauthentication is completed successfully, the current CoAP-EAP
   state is deleted and the new CoAP-EAP becomes the current one.  If by
   any reason, the reauthentication fails to complete, the current CoAP-
   EAP state will be available until it expires or it is renewed in
   another try of re-authentication.

   If the reauthentication fails, it is up to the IoT device decide when
   to restart a reauthentication before the current EAP state expires.

3.4.  Managing the State of the Service

   The IoT device and the Controller keep a state during the CoAP-EAP
   negotiation.  The CoAP-EAP state includes several important parts:

      A reference to an instance of the EAP ( peer or authenticator/
      server) state machine.

      The resource for the next message in the negotiation (e.g '/a/y')

      The MSK exported when the EAP authentication is successful.  In
      particular, CoAP-EAP is able to access to the different variables
      by the EAP state machine (i.e.  [RFC4137]).

      A reference to the OSCORE context.

   Once created, the Controller MAY choose to delete it as described in
   Figure 3.  On the other hand, the IoT device may need to renew the
   CoAP-EAP state because the key material is close to expire, as
   mentioned in Section 3.3.

   There are situations where the current CoAP-EAP state might need to
   be removed.  For instance due to its expiration or a forced removal
   if the IoT device needs to be expelled from the security domain.
   This exchange is illustrated in Figure 3.

   If the Controller deems necessary the removal of the CoAP-EAP state
   from the IoT device before it expires, it can send a DELETE command
   in a request to the IoT device, referencing the last CoAP-EAP state
   resource given by the CoAP server, whose identifier will be the last
   one received (e.g. '/a/w' in Figure 2).  This message is protected



Marin-Lopez & Garcia-CarriExpires 28 April 2022                 [Page 9]

   with the OSCORE security association to prevent forgery.  Upon
   reception of this message, the CoAP server sends a response to the
   Controller with the Code '2.02 Deleted', which is also protected with
   the OSCORE security association.  If a response from the IoT device
   does not arrive after EXCHANGE_LIFETIME the Controller will remove
   the state from its side.

3.5.  Error handling

   This section elaborates how different errors are handled, from EAP
   authentication failure, a non-responding endpoint, lost messages or
   initial POST message arriving out of place.

3.5.1.  EAP authentication failure

   EAP authentication MAY fail for different situations (e.g.  wrong
   credentials).  The result is that the Controller will send an EAP
   failure as a result of the EAP authentication (Step 7 in Figure 2).
   In this case, the IoT device MUST send a response '4.01 Unauthorized'
   in Step 8.  As a consequence, Step 7 and Step 8 are not protected in
   this case because no MSK is exported and the OSCORE security context
   is not generated.

   If the EAP authentication fails during the re-authentication and the
   Controller sends an EAP failure, the current CoAP-EAP state will be
   still usable until it expires.

3.5.2.  Non-responding endpoint

   If, by any reason, one of the entities becomes non-responding, the
   CoAP-EAP state SHOULD be kept only for a period of time before it is
   removed.  The removal of the CoAP-EAP state in the Controller assumes
   that the IoT device will need to authenticate again.  According to
   CoAP, EXCHANGE_LIFETIME considers the time it takes until a client
   stops expecting a response to a request.  A timer is reset every time



Marin-Lopez & Garcia-CarriExpires 28 April 2022                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft                  CoAP-EAP                    October 2021


   a message is sent.  If EXCHANGE_LIFETIME has passed waiting for the
   next message, both entities will delete the CoAP-EAP state if the
   authentication process has not finished correctly.

3.5.3.  Duplicated message with /.well-known/coap-eap

   The reception of the trigger message in Step 0 containing /.well-
   known/coap-eap needs some additional considerations, as the resource
   is always available in the EAP authenticator.

   If a trigger message (Step 0) arrives to the Controller during an
   ongoing authentication, the Controller MUST silently discard this
   trigger message.

   If an old "POST /.well-known/coap-eap" (Step 0) arrives to the
   Controller and there is no authentication ongoing, the Controller may
   understand that a new authentication process is requested.
   Consequently, the Controller will start a new EAP authentication.
   However, the IoT device did not start any authentication and
   therefore it has not selected any resource for the EAP
   authentication.  Thus, IoT device sends a '4.04 Not found' in the
   response (Figure 4).

       IoT device                                 Controller

3.6.  Proxy operation in CoAP-EAP

   The CoAP-EAP operation is intended to be compatible with the use of
   intermediary entities between the IoT device and the Controller, when
   direct communication is not possible.  In this context, CoAP proxies
   can be used as enablers of the CoAP-EAP exchange.





Marin-Lopez & Garcia-CarriExpires 28 April 2022                [Page 11]

Internet-Draft                  CoAP-EAP                    October 2021


   This specification is limited to use standard CoAP [RFC7252] as well
   as standardized CoAP options [RFC8613].  It does not specify any
   addition in the form of CoAP options.  This is expected to ease the
   integration of CoAP intermediaries in the CoAP-EAP exchange.

   There is a consideration that needs to be taken into account, when
   using proxies in the CoAP-EAP, as the exchange contains a role-
   reversal process at the beginning of the exchange.  In the first
   message, the IoT device acts as a CoAP client, and the Controller as
   the CoAP server.  After that, remaining exchanges the roles are
   reversed, being the IoT device, the CoAP server and the Controller,
   the CoAP client.

4.  CBOR Objects in CoAP-EAP

   In the CoAP-EAP exchange, there is information that needs to be
   exchanged between the two entities.  Examples of these are the
   ciphersuites that need to be negotiated or authorization information
   (Session-lifetime).  There may be also a need of extending the
   information that has to be exchanged in the future.  This section
   specifies the CBOR [RFC8949] data structure to exchange information
   between the IoT device and the Controller in the CoAP payload.

   Next, is the specification of the CBOR Object to exchange information
   in CoAP-EAP

        CoAP-EAP_Info = {
            ?  1 : array,                      ; ciphersuite
            ?  2 : bstr,                       ; SID
            ?  3 : bstr,                       ; RID
            ?  4 : uint                        ; Session-Lifetime
        }

                 Figure 5: CBOR data structure for CoAP-EAP

   The parameters contain the following information: ciphersuite: It
   contains a array with the list of the proposed or selected CBOR
   algorithms for OSCORE.  If the field is carried over a request, the
   meaning is the proposed ciphersuite, if it is carried over a
   response, corresponds to the response.

   1.  SID: It contains the Identifier for the Sender ID to be used in
       the OSCORE security context.

   2.  RID: It contains the Identifier for the Recipient to be used in
       the OSCORE security context

   3.  Session-Lifetime: Contains the time the session is valid in
       seconds.

   4.  The values from 65000 to 65535 are reserved for experimentation.

5.  Ciphersuite negotiation and key derivation

5.1.  Cryptographic suite negotiation

   OSCORE runs after the EAP authentication, using the ciphersuite
   selected in the ciphersuite negotiation (Step 1 and 2).  To negotiate
   the ciphersuite, CoAP-EAP follows a simple approach: the Controller
   sends a list, in decreasing order or preference, with the identifiers
   of the supported ciphersuites (Step 1).  In the response to that
   message (Step 2), the IoT device sends a response with the choice.

   This list is included in the payload after the EAP message with a
   CBOR array that contains the ciphersuites.  An example of how the
   fields are arranged in the CoAP payload can be seen in Figure 6.  An
   example of the exchange with the ciphersuite negotiation is shown in
   Figure 7, where can be appreciated the disposition of both EAP-
   Request/Identity and EAP-Response/Identity, followed by the CBOR
   object defined in Section 4, containing in the ciphersuite field the
   CBOR array for the ciphersuite negotiation.

   In case there is no CBOR array stating the ciphersuites, the default
   ciphersuites are applied.  If the Controller sends a restricted list
   of ciphersuites that is willing to accept, and the ones supported by
   the IoT device are not in that list, the IoT device will respond with
   a '4.00 Bad Request', expressing in the payload the ciphersuites
   supported.  Figure 8 illustrates this exchange.

                 Figure 8: Ciphersuite negotiation failure

   The ciphersuite requirements are inherited from the ones established
   by OSCORE.  By default, the HKDF algorithm is SHA-256 and the AEAD
   algorithm is AES-CCM-16-64-128.  Both are mandatory to implement.
   The other ciphersuites supported and negotiated in the ciphersuite
   negotiation are the following:

      0.  AES-CCM-16-64-128, SHA-256

      1.  A128GCM, SHA-256

      2.  A256GCM, SHA-384

   This specification uses the (HMAC)-based key derivation function
   (HKDF) defined in [RFC5869] to derive the necessary key material.
   Since the key derivation process uses the MSK, which is considered
   fresh key material, we will use the HKDF-Expand function, which we
   will shorten here as KDF.

5.2.  Deriving the OSCORE Security Context

   The derivation of the security context for OSCORE allows securing the
   communication between the IoT device and the Controller once the MSK
   has been exported providing, confidentiality, integrity, key
   confirmation (Step 7 and 8) and detecting a downgrading attack.

   The Master Secret can be derived by using the chosen ciphersuite and
   the KDF.  The Master Secret can be derived as follows:

   Master Secret = KDF(MSK, CS | "OSCORE MASTER SECRET", length)

   where:

   *  The algorithms for OSCORE are agreed in the ciphersuite
      negotiation.

   *  The MSK exported by the EAP method.  Discussion about the use of
      the MSK for the key derivation is done in Section 7.

   *  CS is the concatenation of the content of the ciphersuite
      negotiation, that is, the list of ciphersuites sent by the
      Controller (Step 1) the selected option by the IoT device (Step
      2).  If any of the messages did not contain the CBOR array
      (default algorithms), the null string is used.

   *  "OSCORE MASTER SECRET" is the ASCII code representation of the
      non-NULL terminated string (excluding the double quotes around
      it).

   *  CS and "OSCORE MASTER SECRET" are concatenated.

   *  length is the size of the output key material.

   The Master Salt, similarly to the Master Secret, can be derived as
   follows:

   Master Salt = KDF(MSK, CS | "OSCORE MASTER SALT", length)

   where:

   *  The algorithms are agreed in the ciphersuite negotiation.

   *  The MSK exported by the EAP method.  Discussion about the use of
      the MSK for the key derivation is done in Section 7.

   *  CS is the concatenation of the content of the ciphersuite
      negotiation, in the request and response.  If any of the messages
      did not contain the CBOR array, the null string is used.

   *  "OSCORE MASTER SALT" is the ASCII code representation of the non-
      NULL terminated string (excluding the double quotes around it).

   *  CS and "OSCORE MASTER SECRET" are concatenated.

   *  length is the size of the output key material.

   Since the MSK is used derive the Master Key, the correct verification
   of the OSCORE protected request (Step 7) and response (Step 8)
   confirms the Controller and the IoT device have the same Master
   Secret, achieving key confirmation.

   To prevent a downgrading attack, the content of the ciphersuites
   negotiation (which we refer to here as CS) is embedded in the Master
   Secret derivation.  If an attacker changes the value of the
   ciphersuite negotiation, the result will be different OSCORE security
   contexts, that ends up with a failure in Step 7 and 8.

6.  Discussion

6.1.  CoAP as EAP lower layer

   This section discusses the suitability of the CoAP protocol as EAP
   lower layer, and reviews the requisites imposed by the EAP protocol
   to any protocol that transports EAP.  What EAP expects from its lower
   layers can be found in section 3.1 of [RFC3748], which is elaborated
   next:

   Unreliable transport.  EAP does not assume that lower layers are
   reliable but it can benefit for a reliable lower layer.  In this
   sense, CoAP provides a reliability mechanism (e.g.  through the use
   of Confirmable messages).

   Lower layer error detection.  EAP relies on lower layer error
   detection (e.g., CRC, Checksum, MIC, etc.).  CoAP goes on top of UDP/
   TCP which provides a checksum mechanism over its payload.

   Lower layer security.  EAP does not require security services from
   the lower layers.

   Minimum MTU.  Lower layers need to provide an EAP MTU size of 1020
   octets or greater.  CoAP assumes an upper bound of 1024 for its
   payload which covers the requirements of EAP.

   Ordering guarantees.  EAP relies on lower layer ordering guarantees
   for correct operation.  Regarding message ordering, every time a new
   message arrives at the authentication service hosted by the IoT
   device, a new resource is created and this is indicated in a "2.01
   Created" response code along with the name of the new resource via
   Location-Path or Location-Query.  This way the application indicates
   that its state has advanced.  Although the [RFC3748] states: "EAP
   provides its own support for duplicate elimination and
   retransmission", EAP is also reliant on lower layer ordering



Marin-Lopez & Garcia-CarriExpires 28 April 2022                [Page 16]

Internet-Draft                  CoAP-EAP                    October 2021


   guarantees.  In this regard, [RFC3748] talks about possible
   duplication and says: "Where the lower layer is reliable, it will
   provide the EAP layer with a non-duplicated stream of packets.
   However, while it is desirable that lower layers provide for non-
   duplication, this is not a requirement".  CoAP is providing a non-
   duplicated stream of packets and accomplish the "desirable" non-
   duplication.  In addition, [RFC3748] says that when EAP runs over a
   reliable lower layer "the authenticator retransmission timer SHOULD
   be set to an infinite value, so that retransmissions do not occur at
   the EAP layer."

6.2.  Size of the EAP lower layer vs EAP method size

   Regarding the impact that an EAP lower layer will have to the total
   byte size of the whole exchange, there is a comparison with another
   network layer based EAP lower layer, PANA [RFC5191], in [coap-eap].
   Comparing the EAP lower layer (alone) and taking into account EAP.
   On the one hand, at the EAP lower layer level, the usage of CoAP
   gives important benefits.  On the other hand, when taking into
   account the EAP method overload, this reduction is less but still
   significant if the EAP method is lightweight (authors of [coap-eap]
   used EAP-PSK as a representative of a lightweight EAP method).  If
   the EAP method is very taxing, the impact of the reduction in size of
   the EAP lower layer is less significant.  This leads to the
   conclusion that possible next steps in this field could be designing
   new EAP methods that can be better adapted to the requirements of IoT
   devices and networks.

   However, the impact of the EAP lower layer itself cannot be ignored,
   hence the proposal of using CoAP as lightweight protocol for this
   purpose.  Other EAP methods such as EAP-AKA'[RFC5448] or new
   lightweight EAP methods such as EAP-NOOB [I-D.ietf-emu-eap-noob] or
   EAP-EDHOC [I-D.ingles-eap-edhoc] that can benefit, as well as new
   ones that may be proposed in the future with IoT constraints in mind,
   from a CoAP-based EAP lower layer.

7.  Security Considerations

   There are some aspects to be considered such as how authorization is
   managed, the use of MSK as keying material and how the trust in the
   Controller is established.  Additional considerations such as EAP
   channel binding as per [RFC6677] are also discussed here.

7.1.  Authorization

   Authorization is part of bootstrapping.  It serves to establish
   whether the node can join and the set of conditions it has to adhere.
   The authorization data will be gathered from the organization that is
   responsible for the IoT device and sent to the EAP authenticator in
   case of AAA infrastructure is deployed.

   In standalone mode, the authorization information will be in the
   Controller.  If the pass-through mode is used, authorization data
   received from the AAA server can be delivered by the AAA protocol
   (e.g.  RADIUS or Diameter).  Providing more fine-grained
   authorization data can be with the transport of SAML in RADIUS
   [RFC7833].

   After bootstrapping, additional authorization information to operate
   in the security domain, e.g., access services offered by other nodes,
   can be taken care of by the solutions proposed in the ACE WG.

7.2.  Freshness of the key material

   In CoAP-EAP there is no nonce exchange to provide freshness to the
   keys derived from the MSK.  The MSK and Extended Master Session Key
   (EMSK) keys according to the EAP Key Management Framework [RFC5247]
   are fresh key material.  Since only one authentication is established
   per EAP authenticator, there is no need for generating additional key
   material.  In case a new MSK is required, a re-authentication can be
   done, by running the process again, or using a more lightweight EAP
   method to derive additional key material as elaborated in
   Section 3.3.

7.3.  Channel Binding support

   According to the [RFC6677], channel binding related with EAP, is sent
   through the EAP method that supports it.

   To satisfy the requirements of the document, we need to send the EAP
   lower layer identifier (To be assigned by IANA), in the EAP Lower-
   Layer Attribute if RADIUS is used.

7.4.  Additional Security Consideration

   Other security-related concerns can be how to ensure that the node
   joining the security domain can in fact trust the Controller.  This
   issue is elaborated in the EAP Key Management Framework [RFC5247].
   In particular, the constrained node knows it can trust the Controller
   because the key that is used to establish the security association is
   derived from the MSK.  If the Controller has the MSK, it is clear the

   AAA Server of the node trusted the Controller, which can be
   considered as a trusted party.

8.  IANA Considerations

   Considerations for IANA regarding this document:

   *  Assignment of EAP lower layer identifier.

   *  Assignment of the URI /.well-known/a

   *  Assignment of the media type "application/coap-eap"

   *  Assignment of the content format "application/coap-eap"

   *  Assignment of the resource type (rt=) "core.coap-eap"

   *  Assignment of the numbers assigned for the ciphersuite negotiation

   CoAP-EAP makes possible to derive a PSK for (D)TLS to allow PSK-based

                    (*) Protected with (D)TLS

               Figure 9: CoAP-EAP flow of operation with DTLS

   Figure 9 shows the last steps of the operation for CoAP-EAP when
   (D)TLS is used to protect the communication between the IoT device
   and the Controller using the cryptographic material exported by the
   EAP authentication.  The general flow is essentially the same as in
   the case of OSCORE, except that DTLS negotiation is established in
   Step 7).  Once DTLS negotiation has finished successfully the IoT
   device is granted access to the domain.  Step 7 MUST be interpreted
   by the IoT device as an alternate success indication, which will end
   up with the MSK and the DTLS_PSK derivation for the (D)TLS
   authentication based on PSK.

   According to [RFC8446] the provision of the PSK out-of-band also
   requires the provision of the KDF hash algorithm and the PSK
   identity.  To simplify the design in CoAP-EAP, the KDF hash algorithm
   can be included in the list of ciphersuites exchange in Step 1 and
   Step 2 if DTLS wants to be used instead of OSCORE.  For the same
   reason, the PSK identity is derived from Sender ID (SID) and
   Recipient ID (SID) as defined in Appendix A.2.

A.1.  Cryptographic suite negotiation for DTLS

   It is also possible to derive a pre-shared key for DTLS to establish
   a DLTS security association after a successful EAP authentication.
   Analogously to how the ciphersuite is negotiated for OSCORE
   Section 5.1, the Controller sends a list, in decreasing order of
   preference, with the identifiers of the ciphersuites supported (Step
   1).  In the response, the IoT device sends the choice.

   This list is included in the payload after the EAP message with a
   CBOR array that contains the ciphersuites.  This CBOR array is
   enclosed as one of the elements of the CBOR Object used for
   transporting information in CoAP-EAP (See Section 4.  An example of
   how the fields are arranged in the CoAP payload can be seen in
   Figure 6.

   In case there is no CBOR array stating the ciphersuites, the default
   ciphersuite is applied.  If the Controller sends a restricted list of
   ciphersuites that is willing to accept, and the ones supported by the
   IoT device are not in that list, the IoT device will respond with a
   '4.00 Bad Request', expressing in the payload the ciphersuites
   supported.  Figure 8 illustrates this exchange.

   The ciphersuites are the following:

      3.  TLS_SHA256

      4.  TLS_SHA384

      5.  TLS_SHA512

A.2.  Deriving DTLS PSK and identity

   To enable DTLS after an EAP authentication using the key material
   generated, we define the Identity and the PSK for DTLS.  The Identity
   in this case is generated by concatenating the exchanged Sender ID
   and the Recipient ID.

   PSK Identity = SID || RID

   It is also possible to derive a pre-shared key for DTLS [RFC6347],
   refereed to here as "DTLS PSK", from the MSK between both IoT device
   and Controller if required.  The length of the DTLS PSK will depend
   on the ciphersuite.  To have a cryptographic material with sufficient
   length a key of 32 bytes is derived that can be later truncated if
   needed:

   DTLS PSK = KDF(MSK, "DTLS PSK", length).

   where:

   *  MSK is exported by the EAP method.

   *  "DTLS PSK" is the ASCII code representation of the non-NULL
      terminated string (excluding the double quotes around it).

   *  length is the size of the output key material.

Appendix B.  Examples of Use Case Scenario

   For a IoT device to act as a trustworthy entity within a security
   domain, certain key material is needed to be shared between the IoT
   device and the Controller.

   Next, we elaborate on examples of different use case scenarios about
   the usage of CoAP-EAP.  Generally, we are dealing with 4 entities:

   *  2 nodes (A and B), which are IoT devices.  They are the EAP peers.

   *  1 controller (C).  The controller manages a domain where nodes can
      be deployed.  It can be considered a more powerful machine than
      the IoT devices.

   *  1 AAA server (AAA) - Optional.  The AAA is an Authentication,
      Authorization and Accounting Server, which is not constrained.
      Here, the Controller acts as EAP authenticator in pass-through
      mode.

   Generally, any IoT device wanting to join the domain managed by the
   Controller MUST perform a CoAP-EAP authentication with the Controller
   (C).  This authentication MAY involve an external AAA server.  This
   means that A and B, once deployed, will run CoAP-EAP once, as a
   bootstrapping phase, to establish a security association with C.
   Moreover, any other entity, which wants to join and establish
   communications with nodes under C's domain must also do the same.  By
   using EAP, we can have the flexibility of having different types of
   credentials.  For instance, if we have a device that is not battery
   dependent, and not very constrained, we could use a heavier
   authentication method.  With varied IoT devices and networks we might
   need to resort to more lightweight authentication methods (e.g., EAP-
   NOOB[I-D.ietf-emu-eap-noob], EAP-AKA'[RFC5448], EAP-PSK[RFC4764],
   EAP-EDHOC[I-D.ingles-eap-edhoc], etc.) being able to adapt to
   different types of devices according to organization policies or
   devices capabilities.

Internet-Draft                  CoAP-EAP                    October 2021


B.1.  Example 1: CoAP-EAP in ACE

   In ACE, the process of Client registration and provisioning of
   credentials to the client is not specified.  The process of Client
   registration and provisioning can be achieved using CoAP-EAP.  Once
   the process of authentication with EAP is completed, fresh key
   material is shared between the IoT device and the Controller.  In
   this instance, the Controller and the Authorization Server (AS) of
   ACE can be co-located.

   Next, we exemplify how CoAP-EAP can be used to perform the Client
   registration in a general way, to allow two IoT devices (A and B) to
   communicate and interact after a successful client registration.

   Node A wants to communicate with node B (e.g. to activate a light
   switch).  The overall process is divided into three phases.  Let's
   start with node A.  In the first phase, the node A (EAP peer) does
   not yet belong to Controller C's domain.  Then, it communicates with
   C (EAP authenticator) and authenticates with CoAP-EAP, which,
   optionally, communicates with the AAA server to complete the
   authentication process.  If the authentication is successful, a fresh
   MSK is shared between C and node A.  This key material allows node A
   to establish a security association with the C.  Some authorization
   information may be also provided in this step.  In case EAP is used
   in standalone mode, the AS itself having information about the
   devices can be the entity providing said authorization information.
   If authentication and authorization are correct, node A is enrolled
   in controller C's domain for a period of time.  In particular,
   [RFC5247] recommends 8 hours, though the the entity providing the
   authorization information can establish this lifetime.  In the same
   manner, B needs to perform the same process with CoAP-EAP to be part
   of the controller C's domain.

   In the second phase, when node A wants to talk with node B, it
   contacts controller C for authorization to access node B and obtain
   all the required information to do that securely (e.g. keys, tokens,
   authorization information, etc.).  This phase does NOT require the
   usage of CoAP-EAP.  The details of this phase are out of the scope of
   this document, and the ACE framework is used for this purpose
   [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz].

   In the third phase, the node A can access node B with the credentials
   and information obtained from the controller C in the second phase.
   This access can be repeated without contacting the controller, while
   the credentials given to A are still valid.  The details of this
   phase are out of scope of this document.

   It is worth noting that first phase with CoAP-EAP is required to join
   the controller C's domain.  Once it is performed with success, the
   communications are local to the controller C's domain and there is no
   need to perform a new EAP authentication as long as the key material
   is still valid.  When the keys are about to expire, the IoT device
   can engage in a reauthentication as explained in Section 3.3, to
   renew the key material.

B.2.  Example 2: Multi-domain with AAA infrastructures

   We assume we have a device (A) of the domain acme.org, which uses a
   specific kind of credential (e.g., AKA) and intends to join the um.es
   domain.  This user does not belong to this domain, for which first it
   performs a client registration using CoAP-EAP.  For this, it
   interacts with the controller's domain acting as EAP authenticator,
   which in turn communicates with a AAA infrastructure (acting as AAA
   client).  Through the local AAA server to communicate with the home
   AAA server to complete the authentication and integrate the device as
   a trustworthy entity into the domain of controller C.  In this
   scenario, the AS under the role of the Controller receives the key
   material from the AAA infrastructure

B.3.  Example 3: Single domain with AAA infrastructure

   A University Campus, we have several Faculty buildings and each one
   has its own criteria or policies in place to manage IoT devices under
   an AS.  All buildings belong to the same domain (e.g., um.es).  All
   these buildings are managed with a AAA infrastructure.  A new device
   (A) with credentials from the domain (e.g., um.es) will be able to
   perform the device registration with a Controller (C) of any building
   as long as they are managed by the same general domain.

B.4.  Example 4: Single domain without AAA infrastructure

   In another case, without a AAA infrastructure, we have a Controller
   that has co-located the EAP server and using EAP standalone mode we
   can manage all the devices within the same domain locally.  Client
   registration of a node (A) with Controller (C) can also be performed
   in the same manner.

B.5.  Other use cases

B.5.1.  CoAP-EAP for network access control

   One of the first steps for an IoT device life-cycle is to perform the
   authentication to gain access to the network.  To do so, the device
   first has to be authenticated and granted authorization to gain
   access to the network.  Additionally, security parameters such as
   credentials can be derived from the authentication process allowing
   the trustworthy operation of the IoT device in a particular network
   by joining the security domain.  By using EAP, we are able to achieve
   this with flexibility and scalability, because of the different EAP
   methods available and the ability to rely on AAA infrastructures if
   needed to support multi-domain scenarios, which is a key feature when
   the IoT devices deployed under the same security domain, belong to
   different organizations.  Given that EAP is also used for network
   access control, we can adapt this service for other technologies.
   For instance, to provide network access control to very constrained
   technologies (e.g., LoRa network).  Authors in [lo-coap-eap] provide
   an study of a minimal version of CoAP-EAP for LPWAN networks with
   interesting results.  In this specific case, we could leverage the
   compression by SCHC for CoAP [RFC8824].

B.5.2.  CoAP-EAP for service authentication

   It is not uncommon that the infrastructure where the device is
   deployed and the services of the IoT device are managed by different
   organizations.  Therefore, in addition to the authentication for
   network access control, we have to consider the possibility of a
   secondary authentication to access different services.  This process
   of authentication, for example, will provide with the necessary key
   material to establish a secure channel and interact with the entity
   in charge of granting access to different services.  In 5G, for
   example, consider a primary and secondary authentication using EAP
   [TS133.501].
