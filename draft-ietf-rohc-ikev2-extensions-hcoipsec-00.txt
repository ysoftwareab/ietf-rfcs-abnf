Abstract

   When using Header Compression (HC) schemes in conjunction with IPsec
   (i.e., [HCOIPSEC]) a mechanism is needed to negotiate both the HC
   scheme and any associated configuration parameters between end-points
   prior to operation.  Internet Key Exchange (IKE) is a mechanism which
   can be leveraged to handle these negotiations.  This document
   specifies extensions to Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2) that will allow

   header compression schemes and their associated configuration
   parameters to be negotiated for IPsec security associations.

Internet-Draft   Extensions to IKEv2 to Support HCoIPsec  September 2006


1.  Introduction

   Packet header overhead incurred by applications that use IPsec can
   result in inefficient bandwidth utilization of the communications
   channel.  Coupling header compression with IPsec [IPSEC] (i.e.,
   [HCOIPSEC]) offers an efficient way to deploy these applications
   securely.

   HC schemes require their configuration parameters to be negotiated
   between the compressor and decompressor, prior to operation.  Current
   hop-by-hop HC schemes negotiate these parameters through a link-layer
   protocol such as Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP).  This document
   proposes the use of IPsec's parameter negotiation mechanism, IKE, to
   handle HC scheme and parameter negotiation for HCoIPsec.  This
   document details how IKEv2 must be extended to provide the
   functionality required to initialize an HC channel and negotiate HC
   scheme parameters.


2.  Audience

   The target audience of this document includes those who are involved
   with the design and development of Header Compression (HC) schemes,
   IPsec mechanisms, and the IETF HCoIPsec participants.  In addition,
   this document is intended for vendors developing IPsec encryption/
   decryption devices that may be deployed in bandwidth-constrained, IP
   networking environments.


3.  Header Compression Channel Negotiation

   The initialization of a HC session entails negotiating the HC scheme
   to be used, as well as any configuration parameters that are required
   by that particular HC scheme.  IKEv2, an extensible protocol that
   negotiates parameters via request/response message pairs (e.g.
   exchange), will be used to initialize a HCoIPsec session.

   IKEv2 negotiation of a HCoIPsec session is implemented with a Notify
   payload as part of the IKE_AUTH and CREATE_CHILD_SA exchanges.  The
   new Notify payload will be used to negotiate:

   1.  HC scheme
   2.  HC scheme configuration parameters

3.1.  Header Compression Scheme Negotiation

   An IPsec end-point may be able to support multiple compression types,
   including RObust Header Compression (ROHC) [ROHC], IP Header

   Compression (IPHC) [IPHC], Compressed RTP CRTP [CRTP], and/or
   Enhanced Compressed RTP ECRTP [ECRTP].  As such, for a given Child
   SA, the configuration parameters for these HC schemes will be
   negotiated at either the establishment or rekeying of a Child SA.

   The Notify payload will be used during the IKE_AUTH and
   CREATE_CHILD_SA exchanges to negotiate the HCoIPsec session.  This
   payload will contain the proposed/accepted HC schemes for the Child
   SA, as well as the configuration parameters for each scheme.  A new
   Notify Message Type value, denoted HC_SUPPORTED, will be added to
   indicate that the Notify payload is conveying HC information.  In
   addition, the supported HC schemes and their corresponding
   configuration parameters will be communicated in the Notification
   Data field.

   Note: The prioritized list of allowable HC schemes within the
   Notification Data field of the Notify payload should always end with
   NONE, indicating uncompressed traffic.

   The Notify payload used to convey HC information must begin with the
   following payload header:


    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

      payload must be 41, indicating that this current payload is a
      Notify Payload.

      If this notification concerns an existing SA, this field indicates
      the SA type.  This field must contain either (2) to indicate AH or
      (3) to indicate ESP on the Child SA.  For notifications that do
      not relate to an existing SA, this field must be sent as zero and
      ignored on receipt.  This value must not be set to (1), since this
      refers to IKE_SA notifications.  All other values for this field
      are reserved to IANA for future assignment.

   SPI Size (1 octet)
      Length in octets of the SPI as defined by the IPsec protocol ID or
      zero if no SPI is applicable.

      Identifies the HC scheme that is being defined within the HC
      Scheme Configuration Parameters field(s).  The order in which the
      HC ID fields occur within the HC Notify payload define the order
      of preference (i.e. the first HC scheme defined is the scheme most
      preferred by the initiator).

   Next HC ID (1 octet)
      Identifies the HC scheme that will be defined after the HC Scheme
      Configuration Parameters field(s).  If this is the last HC scheme
      to be proposed, this value is set to zero.

   HC Parameter Length (2 octets)
      The length, in octets, of the configuration parameters for this
      particular HC scheme.

      The negotiable parameters for the particular HC scheme.

3.1.1.  Notify Payload For RoHC

   For ROHC, the NOTIFY payload will be of the following form (ignoring
   the header depicted in Figure 1):


    0                   1                   2                   3

   MAX_CID
      The MAX_CID field is two octets and indicates the maximum value of
      a context identifier.  This value must be at least 0 and at most
      16383 (The value 0 implies having one context).

      Suggested value: 15

      Note: The value of LARGE_CIDS will be implicitly determined by
      this value (i.e. if MAX_CID is <= 15, LARGE_CIDS will be assumed
      to be 0).

   MRRU
      The MRRU field is two octets and indicates the maximum
      reconstructed reception unit (see [ROHC], section 5.1.1).

      Suggested value: 0

   MAX_HEADER
      The largest header size in octets that may be compressed.

      Suggested value: 168 octets

      The value of MAX_HEADER should be large enough so that at least
      the outer network layer header can be compressed.  To increase
      compression efficiency MAX_HEADER should be set to a value large
      enough to cover common combinations of network and transport layer
      headers.

      Note: The MAX_HEADER parameter is not used for all RoHC profiles.
      If none of the RoHC profiles require this field, this value is
      ignored.

   suboptions
      The suboptions field consists of zero or more suboptions.  Each
      suboption consists of a type field, a length field and zero or
      more parameter octets, as defined by the suboption type.  The
      value of the length field indicates the length of the suboption in
      its entirety, including the lengths of the type and length fields.

      Note: When a pair of SAs are created (one in each direction), the
      ROHC channel parameter FEEDBACK_FOR is set implicitly to the other
      SA of the pair (e.g. the SA pointing in the reverse direction).

3.1.2.  Notify Payload For IPHC/cRTP/ECRTP

   For IPHC/cRTP/ECRTP, the NOTIFY payload will be of the following form
   (ignoring the header depicted in Figure 1):


    0                   1                   2                   3

   TCP_SPACE
      The TCP_SPACE field is two octets and indicates the maximum value
      of a context identifier in the space of context identifiers
      allocated for TCP.

      Suggested value: 15

      TCP_SPACE must be at least 0 and at most 255 (the value 0 implies
      having one context).

   NON_TCP_SPACE
      The NON_TCP_SPACE field is two octets and indicates the maximum
      value of a context identifier in the space of context identifiers
      allocated for non-TCP.  These context identifiers are carried in
      COMPRESSED_NON_TCP, COMPRESSED_UDP and COMPRESSED_RTP packet
      headers.

      Suggested value: 15

      NON_TCP_SPACE must be at least 0 and at most 65535 (the value 0
      implies having one context).

   F_MAX_PERIOD
      Maximum interval between full headers.  No more than F_MAX_PERIOD
      COMPRESSED_NON_TCP headers may be sent between FULL_HEADER
      headers.

      Suggested value: 256

      A value of zero implies infinity, i.e. there is no limit to the
      number of consecutive COMPRESSED_NON_TCP headers.

   F_MAX_TIME
      Maximum time interval between full headers.  COMPRESSED_NON_TCP
      headers may not be sent more than F_MAX_TIME seconds after sending
      the last FULL_HEADER header.

      Suggested value: 5 seconds

      A value of zero implies infinity.

   MAX_HEADER
      The largest header size in octets that may be compressed.

      Suggested value: 168 octets

      The value of MAX_HEADER should be large enough so that at least
      the outer network layer header can be compressed.  To increase
      compression efficiency MAX_HEADER should be set to a value large
      enough to cover common combinations of network and transport layer
      headers.

   suboptions
      The suboptions field consists of zero or more suboptions.  Each
      suboption consists of a type field, a length field and zero or
      more parameter octets, as defined by the suboption type.  The
      value of the length field indicates the length of the suboption in
      its entirety, including the lengths of the type and length fields.

   The negotiated HC schemes and parameters negotiated via IKEv2 do not
   add any any new vulnerabilities beyond those associated with the
   normal operation of IKEv2.

   assignments will be managed by the IANA.

   The following registry should be updated:
      IKEv2 Notify Message Types (REF4306, Section 3.10.1)

   The following registry should be created:
      HC ID (Section 4.1)

   The following HC IDs should be allocated:


      HC ID  Document   Identifier
        0    RFCthis       None
        1    RFCthis       ROHC
        2    RFCthis       ECRTP
        3    RFCthis       cRTP
        4    RFCthis       IPHC
