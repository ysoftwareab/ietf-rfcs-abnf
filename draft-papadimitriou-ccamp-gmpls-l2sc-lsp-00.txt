Abstract

   Most efforts on Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) have been focused to
   environments of single switching capability devices e.g. one data
   plane layer covering either Packet LSPs or Circuit oriented LSPs
   (Sonet/SDH, OTH, etc.). Relatively few have been said about the
   GMPLS signaling capability to support Layer-2 Label Switched Paths
   (LSPs), and in particular native Ethernet LSPs.

   This document does not extend these capabilities but simply
   details their utilization in several network environments including
   overlays. As such, it may be referred to as detailing the
   applicability statements for GMPLS for Ethernet switching
   environments in support of various deployment scenarios, including
   the peer model and the overlay model (e.g. Generalized VPN (GVPN)
   and user-network interfaces).

2. Introduction

   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) extends MPLS to
   support four new classes of interfaces Layer-2 Switch Capable
   (L2SC), Time-Division Multiplex (TDM), Lambda Switch Capable (LSC)
   and Fiber-Switch Capable (FSC) in addition to Packet Switch Capable
   (PSC) already supported by MPLS. All these interface classes have
   been considered in [GMPLS-ARCH], [GMPLS-RTG] and [RFC-3471].

   However, since so far, most of the efforts have been concentrated in
   facilitating the realization of seamless control integration of
   IP/MPLS networks with SONET/SDH (see [T1.105]/[G.707]) or OTH (see
   [G.709]) optical transport networks. In particular, the integration
   of packet and circuit switching technologies under a unified GMPLS
   control plane provides a unified control management approach for
   both provisioning resources and restoration techniques.

   While being introduced in [GMPLS-ARCH], [GMPLS-RTG] and [RFC-3471],
   the GMPLS capability to control L2SC TE links and Layer-2 LSPs have
   received little attention since so far. For instance, [RFC-3471]
   defines the possibility to have Ethernet encoding types (i.e. the
   encoding of the LSP being requested) and Layer-2 as switching
   capability (i.e. the type of switching to be performed on a
   particular link). In this memo, we will consider a Layer-2 LSP as
   LSP being established between L2SC interfaces. These interfaces are
   defined as being capable of recognizing frame/cell boundaries and

draft-papadimitriou-ccamp-gmpls-l2sc-lsp-00.txt            October 2003


   can switch data based on the content of the frame/cell header
   (example: interfaces on Ethernet switches that switch data based on
   the content of the MAC header).

3. Context

   The reference network considered (but not restricted to) in this
   document is provided in [GMPLS-OVERLAY]. This network is constituted
   by a core network including core-nodes (CN) surrounded by edge nodes
   (EN) that forms the overlay networks. In addition, the present
   document assumes that edge and core nodes are connected by point-to-
   point native Ethernet interfaces (whose bit rate can vary from
   10Mbps to 10Gbps and more in the future). Thus the Traffic
   Engineering (TE) links inter-connecting the edge and the core nodes
   are of type [X,L2SC], where X is any ISC whose switched payload can
   be carried over L2SC TE links. On the other hand, within the
   network, the links interconnecting the core nodes can be either
   [L2SC,L2SC] or any other technology that can carry Layer-2 Ethernet
   payload, in particular [TDM,TDM] and [LSC,LSC]. Note also that in
   the first case, the EN-CN interface defines an LSP region boundary
   (see [MPLS-HIER]). In the second case, this boundary may be found
   within the network.

   Moreover, as defined in [MPLS-HIER], a (data plane) switching layer
   is mapped to a (control plane) LSP region. Following this approach,
   TE links have been extended to non adjacent nodes by the
   introduction of Forwarding Adjacency (FA). Using this concept, a
   node may (under the control of its local policy configuration)
   advertise an LSP as a TE link into the same IGP routing instance as
   the one that induces this LSP. Such a link is referred to as a
   Forwarding Adjacency (FA) and the corresponding LSP to as a
   Forwarding Adjacency LSP (FA-LSP). Since the advertised entity
   appears as a TE link, both end-point nodes of the FA-LSP must belong
   to the same OSPF area/IS-IS level. Afterwards, OSPF/IS-IS floods the
   link-state information about FAs just as it floods the information
   about any other TE link. This allows other nodes to use FAs as any
   other TE links for path computation purposes.

   In this context, at the EN-CN interface, signaling channel may be
   out-of-band or in-band. In the latter case, several implementation
   are possible for the GMPLS signaling message channel: 1) specific
   Ethertype that allows discrimination between data and control
   traffic (that may be directed towards a dedicated destination MAC
   address), 2) dedicated VLAN for the control traffic, and 3) use of a
   dedicated destination MAC address for reaching the peering GMPLS
   controller. Nevertheless, the following specification MUST be
   strictly independent of the signaling transport mechanism used
   between peering GMPLS nodes.

4. Addressing

   Addressing follows the rules defined in [GMPLS-OVERLAY]. The
   important point being that the SESSION and SENDER_TEMPLATE objects

D.Papadimitriou et al. - Expires April 2004                          3

draft-papadimitriou-ccamp-gmpls-l2sc-lsp-00.txt            October 2003


   are end-to-end significant i.e. a single end-to-end RSVP session is
   defined (in compliance with the RSVP paradigm and the RSVP change
   process [RSVP-CHANGE]).

5. Signaling

   Layer-2 LSP setup, notification, graceful and non-graceful deletion
   procedures follow [RFC-3471], [RFC-3473] and [GMPLS-OVERLAY].

5.1 Layer-2 Label Request

   The GENERALIZED_LABEL_REQUEST object uses the following parameters:
   the LSP Encoding Type is set to 2 (Ethernet), the Switching Type is
   set to 51 (L2SC). Translation of the LSP request at the edge CN can
   make use of one of the following method: 1) direct end-to-end LSP
   [RFC-3473], 2) LSP splicing [RFC-3473] and stitching, 3) LSP nesting
   into a FA-LSP [MPLS-HIER]. Note that techniques for automated LSP
   stitching are described in [MPLS-IRN].

   Also, in the overlay context, Ethernet LSPs nesting into an FA-LSP
   applies perfectly well when the ingress/egress edge CN provides
   (flow) multiplexing capabilities.

5.2 Layer-2 Label

   Layer-2 LABEL object follows the generic rules of the GENERALIZED_
   LABEL object defined in [RFC-3471] for C-Type 2. This is a 32-bit
   label value that represents either the port or the interface over
   which the native Ethernet service access the network.

   Other semantics are possible for the Layer-2 labels as long as the
   assigning node fulfils the unicity requirement for the label(s)
   assigned to a given requestor. In the overlay context, the assigning
   node (and requesting node) are either the ingress EN (and CN,
   respectively), or the egress CN (and EN, respectively).

   Bi-directional Layer-2 Ethernet LSPs are indicated by the presence
   of an upstream label in the Path message. Upstream label assignment
   follows the format of the UPSTREAM LABEL object and the procedures
   defined in [RFC-3473].

5.3 Bandwidth Encoding Specifics

   The requested bandwidth for Layer-2 Ethernet LSPs is encoded in the
   SENDER_TSPEC and FLOWSPEC objects as defined in [RFC-3471]. The unit
   is bytes per second. These values are set in the Peak Data Rate
   (PDR) field of Intserv objects [RFC-2210]. For instance, a 1Gbps
   Ethernet LSP will have a PDR value of 0x4CEE6B28. More generally,
   LSP Bandwidth increments of 1 Mbps (at least) are to be provided.

   [RFC3471] gives a definition of values to be used for Ethernet
   signal types. Note that the present document does not assume any

   specific restriction or constraint from the support of different
   Ethernet payload adaptation capabilities.

6. Explicit Routing

6.1 EXPLICIT_ROUTE Object (ERO) Processing

   EXPLICIT ROUTE object can make use of the subobjects defined in
   [RFC-3209] for numbered interfaces and TE links, [RFC-3477] for
   unnumbered interfaces and TE links and finally [RFC-3473] for
   labels. EXPLICIT ROUTE object processing MUST follow the procedures
   defined in [RFC-3209], [RFC-3473], [RFC-3477] and [GMPLS-OVERLAY]
   when applicable.

6.2 RECORD_ROUTE Object (RRO) Processing

   RECORD ROUTE objects can make use of the subobjects defined in
   [RFC-3209] for numbered interfaces, TE links and labels, [RFC-3477]
   for unnumbered interfaces and TE links. RECORD ROUTE object
   processing MUST follow the procedures defined in [RFC-3209], [RFC-
   3473], [RFC-3477] and [GMPLS-OVERLAY] when applicable.

6.3 Explicit Label Control

   Explicit label control refers to the label identification of the
   egress TE link. An ingress node may include an ERO for which the
   last hop includes node-ID of the egress node and any other sub-
   objects necessary to uniquely identify the TE link, component link
   and labels for the requested Ethernet LSP.

   Note: in the overlay context, when the L-bit is set, this last-hop
   may be the only hop included in the ERO (see [GMPLS-OVERLAY]).

7. Security considerations

   In its current version, this memo does not introduce new security
   consideration from the ones already detailed in [RFC-3471] and [RFc-
   3473].
