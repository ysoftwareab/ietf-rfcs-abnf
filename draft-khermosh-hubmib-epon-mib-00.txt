Terminology
The  key  words  "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",  "SHALL  NOT",
"SHOULD",  "SHOULD  NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",  "MAY",  and
"OPTIONAL",  when  used  in the guidelines  in  this  memo,  are  to  be
interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1    The Internet-Standard Management Framework
For  a  detailed  overview of the documents that  describe  the  current
Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC
3410 [RFC3410].

Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the
Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally  accessed
through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects  in  the  MIB are defined using the mechanisms  defined  in  the
Structure  of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies  a  MIB
module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC
2578  [RFC2578],  STD  58,  RFC 2579 [RFC2579]  and  STD  58,  RFC  2580
[RFC2580].

2    Overview
This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based Internets.  In
particular, it defines objects for managing the Ethernet Passive Optical
Networks  (EPON) for Ethernet systems that support it. The  document  is
contains  the registers defined according to the IEEE 802.3ah Draft  2.0
Annex 30A and partitioned accordingly.
The  document also contains a device group section defining the MIBs for
EPON form a device perspective, which are connected directly to the IEEE
802.3ah layer2 specifications.
The  document  also provides amendments to the 802.3 MAU MIBs  documents
for the EFM device type addition.
