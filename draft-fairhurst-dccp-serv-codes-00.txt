Abstract 

   This document describes the usage of the Service Code for the 
   Datagram Congestion Control Protocol, RFC 4340. Service Codes provide 
   a method to identify the intended service/application to process a 
   DCCP Connection Request. It provides improved flexibility in the use 
   and assignment of port numbers for connection multiplexing. The DCCP 
   Service Code can also enable more explicit coordination of services 
   behind NATs and firewalls. This document motivates the setting of 
   Service Codes by applications, rather than assigning a default 
   Service Code value of zero.

Internet-Draft            DCCP Service Codes              November 2006 
    

    

1. Introduction 

   Most Internet transport protocols use "well-known" port numbers to 
   indicate which application service is associated with a connection or 
   message [RFC814]; this includes TCP [RFC793], UDP [RFC768], 
   SCTP [RFC2960],  and DCCP [RFC4340]. Making a port number well-known 
   involves registration with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
   (IANA), which includes defining a service by a unique keyword and 
   reserving a port number from among a fixed pool [IANA]. 

   DCCP specifies a Service Code as a 4-byte value (32 bits). This 
   describes the application-level service to which a client application 
   wishes to connect (RFC4340, Section 8.1.2). Service Codes allow a 
   flexible correspondence between application-layer services and port 
   numbers, which affects how applications interact with DCCP, as well 
   as how services can be deployed behind NATs and firewalls.  

   If an application does not set a Service Code, the connection SHOULD 
   be associated with a Service Code of zero, with the intended server 
   identified only by the destination port number.

2. An Architecture for supporting Service Codes 

   DCCP defines the use of a combination of ports and Service Codes to 
   identify the server application (RFC 4340, sec. 8.1.2). These are 
   described in the following sections. Section 3 describes the use of 
   Service Codes by end hosts and network middleboxes. 

2.1. IANA Port Numbers 

   In DCCP, an endpoint address is associated with a port number, 
   forming a socket; and a pair of sockets uniquely identifies each 
   connection. Ports provide the fundamental de-multiplexing function.  

   Like DCCP, most Internet Transport Protocols (e.g. TCP [RFC793], UDP 
   [RFC768]) also define publicly-known ports for most services, whether 
   intended for public access (e.g., telnet, DNS) or for services 
   typically used between pre-arranged pairs (e.g., X11, SSL). In TCP 
   and UDP these are the primary means of identifying the required 
   service when a connection request is received. 

   The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority currently manages the set of 
   globally reserved port numbers [IANA]. The destination port value 
   that is associated with a service is determined either by an 
   operating system index to a copy of the IANA table (e.g., 
   getportbyname() in Unix, which indexes the /etc/services file), or 
   directly mapped by the application. 

   The UDP and TCP port number space -
                                     - 0..65535 -
                                                - is split into three 
   ranges [RFC2780]: 

   o  0..1023 "well-known", also called "system" ports 

   o  1024..49151 "registered", also called "user" ports 

   o  49152..65535 "dynamic", also called "private" ports 

   One challenge with the use of IANA-managed ports is that this 
   allocates ports globally, for all hosts on the public Internet, even 
   though the association between a port and a service is of interest 
   only to the end hosts participating in a connection. As a result, the 
   fixed space of port numbers is being globally reserved unnecessarily. 
   It is more useful to allocate this name space on a per-host basis 
   [ID.portnames].  

   Well-known/Reserved DCCP ports are described in a separate IANA 
   registry [RFC4340]. This registry may also associate ports with a 
   pre-defined set of Service Codes (see section 2.2).

Internet-Draft            DCCP Service Codes              November 2006 
    

   The source port associated with a connection request, often known as 
   the "ephemeral port", traditionally includes the range 49152-65535, 
   and should also include the 1024-49151 range.   The value used for 
   the ephemeral port is usually chosen by the client operating system. 
   It has been suggested that a randomized choice of port number value 
   can help defend against "blind" attacks [ID.TSVWG.RAND]. Such methods 
   may also be applicable to IETF-defined transport protocols, including 
   DCCP. 

2.2. DCCP Service Code Values 

   DCCP specifies a 4 byte Service Code [RFC4340]. Service codes may be 
   represented in one of three forms: as a decimal number (the canonical 
   method), as a 4 character ASCII string, or as a hexadecimal number.  

   The Service Code identifies the application-level service to which a 
   client application wishes to connect. It is present only in DCCP-
   Connect and DCCP-Response packets and permits a more flexible 
   correspondence between services and port numbers than possible using 
   using the corresponding socket pair (4-tuple of layer-3 addresses and 
   layer-4 ports). This decouples the use of ports for connection 
   demultiplexing and state management, from their use to indicate a 
   desired endpoint service. 

   One method of operation is to assign one Service Code per Port, 
   although multiple applications may be permitted on the same port (if 
   a Server implementation permits this).  

   Service Codes allow a larger number of concurrent connections for a 
   particular service than possible using well-known port numbers, by 
   allowing endpoints to allocate their own port numbers separately, 
   based on services they deploy (c.f. section 2.1). 

2.3. Zero Service Code  

   A Service Code value of zero indicates that the Service Code function 
   is not used by a client. A server uses only the destination port 
   number to identify the required application (as in section 2.1). 

2.4. Reception of a DCCP-Request with a bound Service Code 

   A Service Code value may be associated by the client (initiator of 
   the DCCP-Request), and is used by the server (recipient of the DCCP-
   Request) to associate the connection with the corresponding 
   application. This association MUST be explicit (i.e. the requested 
   Service Code MUST have been previously bound to the destination port 
   at the server). Once connected, the server returns a copy of the

   Service Code in the DCCP-Response packet completing the initial 
   handshake [RFC4340]. 

2.5. Reception of a DCCP-Request with an unbound Service Code 

   DCCP defines a number of possible error conditions that may arise in 
   processing of a Connection Request: 

   o  Connection Refused (Invalid port) 

   o  Too Busy (Service Code/Port may be valid) 

   o  Bad Service Code (Invalid Service Code for specified port) 

   Reception of a DCCP-Request with an invalid destination port MUST 
   result in the DCCP-Request being rejected, and sending a DCCP-Reset 
   with Reset Code "Connection Refused". A server MAY also use the Reset 
   Code "Too Busy" (RFC 4340, sec. 8.1.3). 

   Reception of a DCCP-Request for a port number where the Service Code 
   that is not bound  MUST result in the DCCP-Request being rejected, 
   and returning a DCCP-Reset with Reset Code "Bad Service Code" (RFC 
   4340, sec. 8.1.2). 

2.6. SDP for describing Service Codes 

   Methods that currently signal the use of port numbers, such as the 
   Session Description Protocol (SDP) require extension to support DCCP 
   Service Codes [ID.DCCP.RTP].  

    

3. Use of the DCCP Service Code 

   Like UDP, DCCP uses port numbers to demultiplex connections. Upon 
   receipt of a DCCP-Request including the Service Code, the Code is 
   matched against a list of available services.  

3.1. Setting Service Codes at the Sender 

   Applications SHOULD specify an appropriate Service Code when sending 
   a DCCP-Request packet. Valid Service Codes should be selected from 
   the set of values assigned in the DCCP Service Code Registry 
   maintained by IANA [IANA-SC], or from the uncoordinated private space 
   (RFC 4340, sec. 8.1.2.). An application that does not set a Service 
   Code, SHOULD be associated with a Service Code value of zero.

3.2. Using Service Codes in the Network 

   Port numbers and IP addresses are the accepted methods to identify a 
   flow within an IP network. When the DCCP header has not been 
   encrypted, Middleboxes [RFC3234], such as firewalls, can instead use 
   the Service Code to identify the application (even when running on a 
   non-standard port). Middlebox devices are therefore expected to check 
   Service Code values before port numbers for DCCP. The Service Code 
   values on DCCP-Requests should be used for supplementary checks 
   [RFC4340]. Section 4.1 describes some issues that may arise in this 
   case. 

   The use of the DCCP Service Code can potentially lead to interactions 
   with other protocols that interpret or modify DCCP port numbers. This 
   includes IPsec and other firewall systems, other security mechanisms, 
   other in-band exchange of port numbers, and network address 
   translators (NATs).  

   Network address and port translators, known collectively as NATs, not 
   only interpret DCCP ports, but may also translate/modify them 
   [RFC2993]. This interferes with the use of ports for service 
   identification [RFC3234]. The DCCP Service Code may allow services to 
   be identified behind NATs if NATs are not further extended to 
   translate Service Codes. Middleboxes should not modify the Service 
   Code unless they change the service that a connection is accessing.  

   DCCP connections identified by the Service Code continue to use IP 
   addresses and ports, although neither port number may be well-
   known/reserved. Translation of these ports need to be considered in 
   the operation of NATs. In addition, DCCP Service Codes can reduce the 
   need to correctly interpret port numbers, leading to new 
   opportunities for network address and port translators.  

3.3. Using Service Codes at the Receiver 

   An implementation MUST allow a server application to bind to a 
   Service Code on a fixed port. The Service Code of zero may be the 
   default, indicating that no specific Service Code is in use. 

   An implementation MAY allow server applications to bind to a Service 
   Code specifying a range of acceptable ports. 

   The DCCP Service Codes associates a DCCP Connection with the service 
   that the client expects to be running at the server.  This value MUST 
   take precedence over any service bound to the port number. Two cases 
   can occur:

Internet-Draft            DCCP Service Codes              November 2006 
    

   o  When a DCCP-
                 -Request packet is received with a Service Code value 
      of zero, the connection is associated with an application using 
      the destination port number specified in the DCCP-Request. If 
      there is no specific application associated with the destination 
      port, then the connection MUST be aborted and a DCCP-RESET packet 
      is returned. If the port is not associated with a zero Service 
      Code, then the connection is aborted. 

   o  A DCCP-Request that is received with a non-zero Service Code MUST 
      be checked to validate that the server has associated the Service 
      Code with the specified destination port. If the Service Code is 
      not associated with the port, the corresponding server application 
      is used. If there is no associated application, the server MUST 
      abort the connection by issuing a DCCP-Reset with the reset code 
      "Bad Service Code". 

3.4. Multiple Associations of Service Codes and Ports at the Sender 

   A single Service Code MAY be bound to more than one destination port 
   (wildcarding a range of port values). Also a single destination port 
   MAY be bound to multiple Service Codes (wildcarding a set of Service 
   Codes), although an active connection may only be associated with a 
   single Service Code [RFC4340].   

   o  An end host implementation may provide a method that only allows a 
      single Service Code to be associated with each listening port. 
      This means that a single port may be used only for a pre-specified 
      service; however this service does not need to be permanently 
      running at the Server. The arrival of a DCCP-Request may therefore 
      require launching an application to accept messages from the DCCP 
      connection. This operation could resemble that of "portmapper" or 
      "inetd". 

   o  When a Connection Request is received with a port number that is 
      associated with multiple Service Codes, the listening server needs 
      to provide a method to ensure that the DCCP-Request is associated 
      with an application server that handles the corresponding Service 
      Code. This may require launching an application to accept messages 
      from the DCCP connection. This use may allow a server to offer 
      more than the limit of 65,536 services determined by the size of 
      the Port field (fewer if system/user/dynamic boundaries are 
      preserved). The limit is based solely on the number of unique 
      connections between two hosts (i.e., 4,294,967,296). 

   As in the previous section, when the specified Service Code is not 
   associated with the specified port, the server MUST abort the 
   connection and send a DCCP Reset message.

3.5. Summary of Service Code and Port Handling 

   The basic operation of the Service Codes is as follows: 

   o  A source host issues a DCCP-Request with a Service Code of zero, 
      and chooses either a well-known/reserved destination port or a 
      port number announced by some other means. 

   o  A source host issues a DCCP-Request with a non-zero Service Code 
      and chooses a destination port number that is associated with the 
      Service Code at the destination. 

   o  The destination host, upon receiving a DCCP-Request with a zero 
      Service Code, validates the port is supports a Service Code of 
      zero and then uses the destination port to identify the associated 
      server. 

   o  The destination host, upon receiving a DCCP-Request with a non-
      zero Service Code, determines whether an available service 
      matching the Service Code is running for the specified destination 
      port. 

   o  If the service is not available, a DCCP-Reset packet is returned. 

    

4. Changes required to API to support Service Codes 

   The use of Service Codes requires an API to allow a service to bind 
   to a Service Code as well as a port number. One approach is to use 
   separate commands as follows: 

   o  Extend the existing port number indicator command (e.g., Unix 
      bind() or connect() calls) to select a specific port number where 
      desired. 

   o  Extend the existing socket parameterization command (e.g., Unix 
      setsockopt()) to set a service-code option. 

   o  An information base (table) may be used by servers to identify the 
      set of Service Codes that are associated with each port and the 
      corresponding set of server applications. 

   XXX Author note: 

   May need to discuss:

   and interactions with getadddrinfo() address/port lookup routine, 
   which has been introduced to simplify the migration to IPv6 
   [RFC3493], sec. 6.1. 

   XXX End Author Note. 

4.1. Interactions with IPsec 

   IPsec uses port numbers to perform access control in transport mode 
   [RFC4301].  Security policies can define port-specific access control 
   (PROTECT, BYPASS, DISCARD), as well as port-specific algorithms and 
   keys. Similarly, firewall policies allow or block traffic based on 
   port numbers. 

   Use of port numbers in IPsec selectors and firewalls may assume that 
   the numbers correspond to well-known services. It is useful to note 
   that there is no such requirement; any service may run on any port, 
   subject to mutual agreement between the endpoint hosts.  Use of the 
   Service Code may interfere with this assumption both within IPsec and 
   in other firewalling systems, but it does not add a new 
   vulnerability. New implementations of IPsec and firewall systems may 
   interpret the Service Code when implementing policy rules, but should 
   not rely on either port numbers or Service Codes to indicate a 
   specific service. 

   This is not an issue for IPsec because the entire DCCP header and 
   payload are protected by all IPsec modes. None of the DCCP header is 
   protected by application-layer security, e.g., DTLS [ID.DTLS.DCCP], 
   so again this is not an issue [RFC4347]. 

 

5. Service Code Registry 

   The set of Service Codes currently specified for use within the 
   general Internet are defined in an IANA-controlled name space. IANA 
   manages new allocations of Service Codes in this space [RFC4340]. 
   Service Code bindings to Ports may also be defined in the IANA DCCP 
   Port Registry.

6. Security Considerations 

   This document does not describe new protocol functions.  

   The document discusses the usage of Service Codes. There are three 
   areas of security that are important: 

   1. Interaction with NATs and firewalls (see section 3.2, on middlebox 
      behaviour). 

   2. Interaction with IPsec and DTLS security (see section 4.1, on use 
      of IPsec). 

   3. Interpretation of DCCP Service Codes over-riding traditional use 
      of reserved/well-known port numbers (see section 6.1) 

    

   6.1  Interactions of Service Codes and port numbers 

   The Service Code value may be used to over-ride the traditional way 
   that operating systems consider low-numbered ports as privileged. 
   This represents a change in the way operating systems respect this 
   range of DCCP port numbers. 

   The same service (application) may be potentially accessed using more 
   than one Service Code. Examples include the use of separate Service 
   Codes for an application layered directly upon DCCP and one using 
   DTLS transport over DCCP. Other possibilities include the use of a 
   private Service Code point that maps to the same application as 
   assigned to an IANA-defined Service Code value. Different versions of 
   a service (application) may also be mapped to a corresponding set of 
   Service Code values. Care needs to be exercised when interpreting the 
   mapping the Service Code value to the corresponding service. 

   Processing of Service Codes may imply more processing than currently 
   associated with incoming port numbers. Implementers need to guard 
   against increasing opportunities for Denial of Service attack. 

    

7. IANA Considerations 

   This document does not specify a new IANA registry allocation, and 
   does not solicit IANA action. It is NOT required to supply an 
   approved document (e.g. a published RFC) to support an application

   for a DCCP Service Code value, although RFCs may be used to request 
   Service Code values via the IANA Considerations section. 

   XXX Author Note: Should this document allocate a set of well-known 
   Service Codes ??

8. Conclusions 

   This document discusses the operation of service codes by the DCCP 
   transport protocol [RFC4340] and motivates their use. The document 
   augments and clarifies the way in which DCCP applications should use 
   the Service Code Feature. It does not update or obsolete the protocol 
   defined in RFC4340. 

   Service Codes, or similar concepts may also be useful to other IETF 
   Transport Protocols [ID.Portnames].
