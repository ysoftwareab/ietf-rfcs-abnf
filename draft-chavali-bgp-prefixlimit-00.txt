Abstract

   This document proposes a mechanism to allow BGP peers to coordinate
   the setting of a limit on the number of prefixes which one BGP
   speaker will send to its peer.  Coordination can prevent disruption
   of the peering session or discarding of routes, which can occur when
   a maximum prefix limit is configured on the "receiving" peer, and the
   "sending" peer exceeds the limit.

1.  Terms

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

   In this document we use the term "BGP sender" to refer to a BGP
   speaker which is advertising prefixes to its peer.  We use the term
   "BGP receiver" to refer to a BGP speaker which is receiving prefixes
   from its peer.  Although it is clear that in reality each peer is
   usually both a "BGP sender" and a "BGP receiver", we emphasize a
   unidirectional relationship in this document for clarity.

2.  Introduction

   There are many scenarios where BGP [BGP-4] peering may be established
   between two speakers in which there is an expectation that some
   limited number of prefixes will be announced by a given speaker.
   Several of these scenarios are described in the following section. In
   these scenarios, if the expected number of prefixes is exceeded, then
   the peering session may be disrupted.  The disruption may be due to a
   specific configuration which is functioning properly in order to
   prevent an overload condition, or it may occur when the receiving BGP
   speaker becomes overloaded and suffers various consequences.

   Note that in this document we use the term "BGP sender" (or
   "sender")to refer to a BGP speaker which is advertising prefixes to
   its peer.  We use the term "BGP receiver" (or "receiver") to refer to
   a BGP speaker which is receiving prefixes from its peer. A BGP
   speaker will typically be both a BGP sender and receiver, but we
   focus on a unidirecitonal relationship for clarity.

   Several implementations of BGP offer a configuration option that
   allows a BGP receiver to provision a limit to the number of prefixes
   it will accept from a specific peer.  When the limit is exceeded,
   then there are generally two options: the prefixes exceeding the
   limit can be dropped by the BGP receiver, or the peering session may
   be terminated by the BGP receiver and restarted at a later time.
   Neither of these options is desirable.  Dropping prefixes leads to
   network unreliability, since the dropped prefixes will be unreachable
   through the BGP receiver.  Terminating the BGP session is probably
   worse, since all traffic between the peers will typically be
   disrupted, even for those prefixes which were advertised before the
   limit was reached.  Other undesirable effects include resource
   utilization on the peers from restarting the peering session, and the
   processing load and bandwidth utilization from withdrawing and re-
   advertising the prefixes throughout the Internet.

   In many cases, the result of not limiting the number of received BGP
   prefixes can be much worse than either case just mentioned.  If the
   BGP receiver becomes overloaded, it can fail and affect many or all
   of its peers.

   The effects of the disruptions caused by lost peering sessions and
   device failures  propagate through the Internet, leading to
   instability as described in detail in [BGP-STUDY].

   Although there are a variety of conditions which can cause a BGP
   sender to announce more prefixes than expected, the root cause of the
   problems described above is that the BGP sender is not aware of the
   limits set by the BGP receiver, and does not have a specific
   mechanism to restrict the number of announced prefixes to the number
   allowed by the receiver.  This proposal addresses most of these
   issues in a manner which minimizes the likelihood for severe
   disturbances to network service when the BGP sender exceeds the
   allowed number of prefixes.

2.1  Background


   In the basic BGP protocol, BGP speaker have announce all routes
   permitted by bgp policy to peers.  With the introduction of Virtual
   Private Networks (VPN) services using additional private routes comes
   a potential for unexpected route overload based on misconfiguration
   or true addition of routes. Another source of unexpected route
   increases are denial of service attacks based in sending additional
   more specific routes or virtual private network routes.

   Close cooperation between the operators of two peered BGP speakers
   can coordinate the configurations of the two devices and avoid many
   issues.  However, network changes, misconfigurations,
   miscommunications, or other factors frequently result in situations
   where the number of prefixes advertised from a BGP sender to the
   receiver exceeds the expected number, and the configurations must be
   revised.  Until the configurations can be modified, various
   disruptions can result.

   The intent of this proposal is to provide a mechanism by which both
   peers can become aware of a prefix limit.  If the number of prefixes
   approaches the known limit, both peers can provide warning to their
   respective operators, and even if the limit is reached, both devices
   can behave in a manner to preserve network stability until the
   operators can address the cause of the excessive prefix condition.
   In addition, the option to terminate the session is retained in order
   to protect the BGP receiver, if the BGP sender ignores the limit.

Internet Draft   draft-chavali-bgp-prefixlimits-00.txt    September 2003


   The basic function proposed here is for a BGP receiver which
   implements a limit on the number of prefixes which it will accept (a
   "maximum prefix limit") to send an advertisement of that limit to its
   peer BGP sender, at the time the peering session is initiated.  That
   is, a BGP receiver configured with a maximum-prefix limit notifies
   its peer BGP sender of the limit, so that the sender should
   automatically restrict the number of prefixes it announces, in order
   to comply with the limit.

2.2  Current Service Provider Perspective


   We provide an example to illustrate a typical Service Provider's (SP)
   practice with maximum prefix limit. The provider may set two levels
   of threshold on the BGP receivers at the network edge: - low water
   mark as warning threshold - high water mark as dropping threshold.

   When the warning threshold is triggered, SNMP traps are transmitted
   by the SP's BGP receiver (router) to the SP's management system. The
   operator needs to contact the customer upon receiving the trap. When
   the dropping threshold with maximum prefix limit is reached, the BGP
   session may be dropped by the BGP receiver. Again it would generate
   traps on the provider side. (Some implementation may not drop the
   session, but drop the customer's routes or prefixes silently.) Then
   the operator needs to work with the customer to correct the problem
   and restart the session.

   There are several issues around this process: - First, the provider
   has to prove to the customer that the session drop was due to
   customer violating the agreed maximum prefix limit rather than being
   due to the operator's network condition causing the session drop. -
   Secondly, the operator has to work with customer to locate the root
   cause, and more likely manually bring back the BGP peering session at
   an agreed time. This is labor intensive for the operator and the
   customer. - Finally, the customer may be unhappy about the session
   drop regardless of the reason.

   Due to the above reasons, as todays common practice, a provider may
   choose not to use the maximum prefix limit feature for their Internet
   services to avoid these complications. But the same provider may
   choose to use the maximum prefix limit feature in their MPLS VPN
   services for customer connection, due to edge device resource
   management needs which are particularly associated with VPN services.

   The issues of where to use and not to use the maximum prefix limit
   feature are beyond the scope of this draft.

   In this draft, we are promoting a proactive approach to dealing with

Internet Draft   draft-chavali-bgp-prefixlimits-00.txt    September 2003


   maximum prefix limit issues. With reference to the example above on
   the relation of provider and customer edge devices, we propose to
   engage the customer edge devices (BGP senders) to participate in the
   process as well. When the maximum prefix limit with multiple
   thresholds is first set on the provider edge device, it is
   immediately communicated to the customer edge devices device through
   BGP signaling, and both sides communicate dynamically whenever an
   unexpected event triggers any of the threshold levels.

   We propose to set three levels of threshold:  - The first level
   triggers the warning on both provider and customer edge devices, so
   customer should act on it without waiting for the provider to call. -
   The second level triggers the customer edge device to stop sending
   routes, as it is reaching the agreed max prefix limit. This may also
   result in traps being issued on both customer and provider side. The
   idea is to have the customer take action to fix the problem without
   dropping the session, thereby requiring less human intervention from
   the provider side. - The third level triggers the session drop action
   from the provider side. This is used as safeguard for the providers
   network in case the customer edge device did not behave as expected
   and is continuing to send routes after exceeding the second level
   threshold.

   We believe this feature can help both providers and customers to
   proactively manage their BGP connections by dynamic signaling,
   monitoring and taking corrective actions before any drastic action is
   necessary. In many cases, this can help avoid service interruption,
   avoid finger-pointing when sessions are dropped, lower operation
   cost, and increase customers satisfaction. In general, this feature
   can be applied to provider - provider peering connections as well,
   with similar advantages.

3.  Analysis of Prefix Limit Scenarios

   This section describes some scenarios in which it is desirable to
   limit the number of prefixes advertised between BGP speakers, and the
   operation of the proposed mechanism in the scenario. It should be
   noted here that this feature is not just restricted to these
   scenarios.

3.1  ISP and Customer with VPN

   Consider the following scenario where BGP peering session is
   established between the CE and the PE.

           +--------+                     +--------+
           |   CE   | <-----------------> |   PE   |
           +--------+                     +--------+



Srikanth Chavali et.al.  Expires February 2004                  [Page 5]





Internet Draft   draft-chavali-bgp-prefixlimits-00.txt    September 2003


   Both the PE and the CE need to support this functionality. In this
   case both the CE and PE exchange prefix limits as an optional
   capability parameter in OPEN message. When CE runs into a situtaion
   where it has routes to advertise and the maximum prefix limit
   condition is encountered it stops sending new UPDATES. This helps the
   CE and PE take corrective measures without affecting itself and the
   PE, thus saving service disruption. Both the PE and CE get benefitted
   from this. In the options provided by several implementations the CE
   would continue to send routes even after exceeding the maximum
   prefixes. It could be stopped only after a manual intervention at CE
   at that very instant. PE after detecting the excess routes recieved
   would either discard routes or would reset the peering session. The
   effects of these have already been introduced in section 2.

3.2  Two ISPs and Multi-homed Customer


              AS1                            AS2

           +--------+                     +--------+
           |   R1   |---------------------|   R3   |
           +--------+                     +--------+
               |_____________ _______________|
                _____________X_______________
               |                             |
           +--------+                     +--------+
           |   R2   |---------------------|   R4   |
           +--------+                     +--------+

   In the above multihoming scenario service provider managing AS2
   routers R3 and R4 would be able to predic the routes they can receive
   from R1 and R2 in AS1. This will enhance their ability to better plan
   and optimize their resources through configurations in such a way
   that it will increase their revenues and provide uninterrupted
   service. Similar advantages hold true for this scenario described
   section 2, however in this case both the service providers of AS1 and
   AS2 get benefitted.

4.  Definition of Prefix limit

   Prefix limit is encoded as an optional capability parameter [BGP-CAP]
   in the BGP OPEN message [BGP-4] by each BGP speaker as shown below:

   0                   1                   2                   3

   Meaning for each of the bitwise indicated capability fields above is
   as follows:

   Code:

   code identifying this capability (TBD)

   Length:

   length of the capability value field is 34 octets

   Address Family Identifier AFI:

   This along with the Subsequent Address Family Indentifier field
   identifies the Network Layer Protocol associated with the Network
   Address.

   Subsequent Address Family Identifier SAFI:

   This along with the Address Family Identifier field identifies the
   Network Layer Protocol associated with the Network Address.

   sub code 1:

   It is used to identify the number of routes sent before raising
   warning. This is done by the BGP speaker that detects it.

   warning prefix limit:

   Number of routes sent by the BGP sender. The value for this field is
   dependent on the maximum prefix limit and SHOULD be always less than

   it.

   w (Warning Indicator):

   This field can be assigned a value of 1 or 0. A value of 1 means the
   warning indication is necessary and SHOULD be used by the sender when
   its route advertisement equals the number of sent routes. A value of
   0 means that the sender SHOULD NOT raise any warning. The warning
   mechanisms are described in the operation section of this draft.

   sub code 2:

   It is used to identify the number of routes sent before the sender
   BGP speaker needs to stop advertising routes to its receiving BGP
   speaker.

   maximum prefix limit:

   Number of routes sent by the sender BGP speaker.

   s (Stop Advertisement):

   This field is always assigned a value of 1. This means that the route
   advertisement MUST be stopped by the BGP speaker. It is implicit here
   that the BGP speaker that encounters this situation will stop route
   advertisement to its receiving BGP speaker.

   sub code 3:

   It is used to identify the number of routes received after which the
   BGP speaker will reset the peering session. It MUST be noted here
   that this situation will never be encountered if adhered to the
   draft. In other words this happens only during error conditions. The
   error conditions are beyond the scope of this document.

   reset prefix limit:

   Number of routes sent by the sender BGP speaker. The value for this
   field is dependent on the maximum prefix limit and SHOULD be always
   greater than it.

   r (Reset Peering):

   This field is always assigned a value of 1. This means that the
   receiving BGP speaker will reset the peering session if the route
   advertising BGP speaker advertises routes exceeding value of number
   of sent routes to its peer.

   sub code 4:

   The receiving BGP speaker uses this sub-code to indicate to its
   sender BGP speaker the current count of the routes received from it.

   current Rx routes:

   Number of routes received by the BGP speaker from its sender BGP
   speaker. The value of this field SHOULD always be less than or equal
   to the maximum prefix limit configured to receive from the sender BGP
   speaker.

   sub code 5:

   The receiving BGP speaker uses this sub-code to indicate to its peer
   the current count of the routes sent to it.

   current Tx routes:

   Number of routes sent by the sender BGP speaker to its receiving BGP
   speaker. The value of this field SHOULD always be less than or equal
   to the maximum prefix limit it received from the sender BGP speaker
   in the capability.

   Resv:

   The value of this field SHOULD be set to 0 when sending the
   capability and SHOULD be ignored when receiving it.

   We refer to the warning prefix limit, maximum prefix limit and the
   reset prefix limit as prefix limits in this document for the ease of
   illustration.

5.  Operation

5.1 Exchanging the configured prefix limits

   BGP speakers exchange the prefix limits as an optional capability
   parameter [BGP-CAP] as described in section 4.

           +--------+                     +--------+
           |    A   | <-----------------> |    B   |
           +--------+                     +--------+

                           Figure 1

   In figure 1 both BGP speakers A and B exchange the prefix limits to
   indicate the support for this capability. Each of A and B set the

Internet Draft   draft-chavali-bgp-prefixlimits-00.txt    September 2003


   warning prefix limit, maximum prefix limit and reset prefix limit
   along with the actions associated with each of them in the capability
   message before exchanging them. The warning prefix limit and reset
   limit values are determined based on the configured maximum prefix
   limit. They are typically a percentage value of the maximum prefix
   limit. The exact percentage values are beyond the scope of this
   document. The maximum prefix limit configured on A for the peer B
   implies the maximum number of prefixes that A expects to receive from
   B. B informs this in the new capability described in section 4. The
   same interpretation applies to B too.

   5.2 Route processing after prefix limits exchange

   In figure 1 both A and B maintain a count of the routes that they
   receive from each other. Route processing operation is illustrated
   using the case where B sends route advertisements to A. The same
   operational procedures apply for the other case of A sending route
   advertisements to B. B as shown in figure 1 applies the out bound
   route policies on the Adjacent-Rib-Out followed by the condition of
   the prefix limits before route advertisements.

           +--------+                     +--------+
           |    A   | <-----------------> |    B   |
           +--------+                     +--------+

                                         B detects warning
                                         prefix limit
                                <------  generates dynamic
                                         capability message
                                         to A
                          Figure 2

   In figure 2 it can be seen in due course of route advertisements to
   A, B generates a dynamic capability  [BGP-DYN-CAP] destined to A. B
   sends the count of received and sent routes to A in current Rx routes
   and current Tx routes of the capability message. The reason B sends
   this message in this case is that it detects the warning limit at the
   time of route advertisements earlier than A. In other words either A
   or B or both of them could generate this message depending on timing
   of warning limit detection. B and A MAY choose to raise internal
   warning when this condition is detected. Following the warnings both
   A and B continue advertising routes normally to each other.

                          Figure 3

   In figure 3, B during route advertisement detects that the maximum
   prefix limit for route advertisement is reached. It SHOULD stop
   further route advertisements to A. In other words in this condition
   it SHOULD implicitly mean to B that the announce policy to A is
   stop/deny. B then SHOULD send a Dynamic Capability [BGP-DYN-CAP] to A
   indicating the latest count of routes sent to A in currrent Tx routes
   and the received routes from A current Rx routes of the capability.
   As in the case of warning prefix limit condition either A or B or
   both could send dynamic capability [BGP-DYN-CAP]. Any route
   withdrawal to A is automatically recorded and SHOULD result in
   restoring the announce policy to the configured one (if any
   configured) implicitly. This helps in, preserving the incremental
   nature of the protocol and avoiding processing of routes by peers
   such as B, which get discarded by speakers such as A when the limit
   is reached. In addition to these network bandwidth consumption by the
   route UPDATES can be avoided. It is expected that conformance to this
   document will not lead to any further route advertisements to A by B
   unless there exists an unforseen error. Under such situation A can
   reset the peering session as indicated in the maximum prefix limit to
   B during the capability negotiation.

   5.3 Prefix limit changes

   If a need for prefix limits change arises, each BGP speaker A whose
   configuration changes for its peer B, SHOULD dynamically [BGP-DYN-
   CAP] inform the corresponding peer of this change. Such changes
   SHOULD be handled as described in the following sub-sections.

   5.3.1 Processing when maximum prefix limit is increased

   When the prefix limits are increased in the configuration of A in
   figure 1, it SHOULD inform B about it as described in 5.3. B SHOULD
   then restart the route advertisements and it MAY either choose to do
   so from the Adjacent-Rib-Out for A incrementally or make use of Route
   Refresh mechanism [BGP-RREFRESH], if it has stopped because of
   reaching the maximum prefix limit. The former methodology is similar
   to the approach taken prior to the introduction of Route Refresh. In
   other words it can be handled in the way policy changes were handled
   prior to the availability of Route Refresh mechanism, with a minor
   change of just sending the  routes that were rejected due to the
   prefix limit. In doing so the restart of BGP peering and the

   associated network traffic and service disruption with it, is
   avoided. If the maximum prefix limit is not reached and increased
   prefix limits are received by the peer B, then peer B SHOULD note
   this and continue with its advertisements to A until these limits are
   reached.

   5.3.2 Processing when the maximum prefix limit is decreased

   When the prefix limits are decreased in the configuration of A (refer
   figure 1), then B SHOULD be informed about it as described in 5.3. B
   then SHOULD note this information and SHOULD stop route advertisement
   immediately if the number of route adtverisments exceeds this new
   maximum prefix limit for A. By doing so B can avoid processing the
   routes which will be discarded by A when it detects the maximum
   prefix limit condition. A does this even before adding the routes to
   its Adjacent-Rib-In for the peer or in some cases restarting of the
   peering session. Additionally, network bandwidth consumption by the
   routing UPDATES can be avoided this way. B at that point follows the
   process described in 4.2 for route processing.

6. Error Handling

   New error codes along with the sub-codes are defined (TBD).
   If a BGP peer does not support this capability and receives it, then
   the peer sends a NOTIFICATION with the appropriate error code and the
   sub-code. The BGP speaker then SHOULD re-initiate the peering session
   without the unsupported capability.

7. Security Considerations

    This document does not change the underlying security issues in the
   BGP protocol. It however, does provide an additional mechanism to
   protect against Denial of service attacks based on exceeding
   configured maximum prefix limits.
