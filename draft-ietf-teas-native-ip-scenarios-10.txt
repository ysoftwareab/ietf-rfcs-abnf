      Scenarios and Simulation Results of PCE in Native IP Network
                 draft-ietf-teas-native-ip-scenarios-10

Abstract

   Requirements for providing the End to End(E2E) performance assurance
   are emerging within the service provider network.  While there are
   various technology solutions, there is no one solution which can
   fulfill these requirements for a native IP network.  One universal
   (E2E) solution which can cover both intra-domain and inter-domain
   scenarios is needed.

   One feasible E2E traffic engineering solution is the addition of
   central control in a native IP network.  This document describes
   various complex scenarios and simulation results when applying the
   Path Computation Element (PCE) in a native IP network.  This
   solution, referred to as Centralized Control Dynamic Routing (CCDR),
   integrates the advantage of using distributed protocols and the power
   of a centralized control technology.

1.  Introduction

   A service provider network is composed of thousands of routers that
   run distributed protocols to exchange the reachability information.
   The path for the destination network is mainly calculated, and
   controlled, by the distributed protocols.  These distributed
   protocols are robust enough to support most applications, but have
   some difficulties supporting the complexities needed for traffic

   engineering applications, e.g.  E2E performance assurance, or
   maximizing the link utilization within an IP network.

   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) using Traffic Engineering (TE)
   technology (MPLS-TE)[RFC3209]is one solution for traffic engineering
   network but it introduces an MPLS network and related technology
   which would be an overlay of the IP network.  MPLS-TE technology is
   often used for Label Switched Path (LSP) protection and complex path
   set-up within a domain.

   It has not been widely deployed for meeting E2E (especially in inter-
   domain) dynamic performance assurance requirements for an IP network.

   Segment Routing [RFC8402] is another solution that integrates some
   advantages of using a distributed protocol and a centrally control
   technology, but it requires the underlying network, especially the
   provider edge router, to do a label push and pop action in-depth, and
   adds complexity, when coexisting with the Non-Segment Routing
   network.  Additionally, it can only maneuver the E2E paths for MPLS
   and IPv6 traffic via different mechanisms.

   Deterministic Networking (DetNet)[RFC8578] is another possible
   solution.  It is primarily focused on providing bounded latency for a
   flow and introduces additional requirements on the domain edge
   router.  The current DetNet scope is within one domain.  The use
   cases defined in this document do not require the additional
   complexity of deterministic properties and so differ from the DetNet
   use cases.

   This draft describes scenarios for a native IP network that a
   Centralized Control Dynamic Routing (CCDR) framework can easily
   solve, without requiring a change of the data plane behavior on the
   router.  It also provides path optimization simulation results to
   illustrate the applicability of the CCDR framework.

   This draft is the base document of the following two drafts: the
   universal solution draft, which is suitable for intra-domain and
   inter-domain TE scenario, is described in
   [I-D.ietf-teas-pce-native-ip]; the related protocol extension
   contents is described in [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-extension-native-ip]

3.  CCDR Scenarios

   The following sections describe various deployment scenarios for
   applying the CCDR framework.

3.1.  QoS Assurance for Hybrid Cloud-based Application

   With the emergence of cloud computing technologies, enterprises are
   putting more and more services on a public oriented cloud
   environment, but keeping core business within their private cloud.
   The communication between the private and public cloud sites will
   span the Wide Area Network (WAN) network.  The bandwidth requirements
   between them are variable and the background traffic between these
   two sites varies over time.  Enterprise applications require
   assurance of the E2E Quality of Service(QoS) performance on demand
   for variable bandwidth services.

   CCDR, which integrates the merits of distributed protocols and the
   power of centralized control, is suitable for this scenario.  The
   possible solution framework is illustrated below:

                               \\--------------//

                  Figure 1: Hybrid Cloud Communication Scenario

   As illustrated in Figure 1, the source and destination of the "Cloud
   Based Application" traffic are located at "Private Cloud Site" and
   "Public Cloud Site" respectively.

   By default, the traffic path between the private and public cloud
   site is determined by the distributed control network.  When
   application requires the E2E QoS assurance, it can send these
   requirements to the PCE, and let the PCE compute one E2E path which
   is based on the underlying network topology and the real traffic
   information, to accommodate the application's QoS requirements.
   Section 4.4 of this document describes the simulation results for
   this use case.

3.2.  Link Utilization Maximization

   Network topology within a Metro Area Network (MAN) is generally in a
   star mode as illustrated in Figure 2, with different devices
   connected to different customer types.  The traffic from these
   customers is often in a tidal pattern, with the links between the
   Core Router(CR)/Broadband Remote Access Server(BRAS) and CR/Service
   Router(SR), experiencing congestion in different periods, because the
   subscribers under BRAS, often use the network at night, and the
   dedicated line users under SR, often use the network during the
   daytime.  The link between BRAS/SR and CR must satisfy the maximum
   traffic volume between them respectively and this causes these links
   often to be under-utilized.

              Figure 2: Star-mode Network Topology within MAN

   If we consider connecting the BRAS/SR with a local link loop (which
   is usually lower cost), and control the overall MAN topology with the
   CCDR framework, we can exploit the tidal phenomena between the BRAS/
   CR and SR/CR links, maximizing the utilization of these links (which
   are usually higher cost).

3.3.  Traffic Engineering for Multi-Domain

   Service provider networks are often comprised of different domains,
   interconnected with each other,forming a very complex topology as
   illustrated in Figure 4.  Due to the traffic pattern to/from the MAN
   and IDC, the utilization of the links between them are often
   asymmetric.  It is almost impossible to balance the utilization of
   these links via a distributed protocol, but this unbalance can be
   overcome utilizing the CCDR framework.

        Figure 4: Traffic Engineering for Complex Multi-Domain Topology

   A solution for this scenario requires the gathering of NetFlow
   information, analysis of the source/destination AS, and determining
   what is the main cause of the congested link.  After this, the
   operator can use the external Border Gateway Protocol(eBGP) sessions
   to schedule the traffic among the different domains according to the
   solution described in CCDR framework.

3.4.  Network Temporal Congestion Elimination

   In more general situations, there are often temporal congestion
   within the service provider's network.  Such congestion phenomena
   often appear repeatedly, and if the service provider has methods to
   mitigate it, it will certainly improve their network operations
   capabilities and increase satisfaction for their customers.  CCDR is
   also suitable for such scenarios, as the controller can schedule
   traffic out of the congested links, lowering the utilization of them
   during these times.  Section 4.5 describes the simulation results of
   this scenario.

4.  CCDR Simulation

   The following sections describe one case study to illustrate CCDR
   algorithm, the topology and traffic matrix generation process and the
   optimization results for E2E QoS assured path and congestion
   elimination in applied scenarios.

   The structure and scale of the simulated topology is similar with the
   real network.  Several amounts of traffic matrix are generated to
   simulate the different congestion condition in network, only one of
   them is illustrated.

4.1.  Case Study for CCDR algorithm

   Figure 5 depicts the topology of the network for the case study of
   CCDR algorithm.  There are 8 forwarding devices in the network.  The
   original cost and utilization are marked on it, as shown in the
   figure.  For example, the original cost and utilization for the link
   (1,2) are 3 and 50% respectively.  There are two flows: f1 and f2.
   Both of these two flows are from node 1 to node 8.  For simplicity,
   it is assumed that the bandwidth of the link in the network is 10Mb/
   s.  The flow rate of f1 is 1Mb/s, and the flow rate of f2 is 2Mb/s.
   The threshold of the link in congestion is 90%.

   If OSPF protocol (ISIS is similar, because it also use the Dijstra's
   algorithm) is applied in the network, which adopts Dijkstra's
   algorithm, the two flows from node 1 to node 8 can only use the OSPF
   path (p1: 1->2->3->8).  It is because Dijkstra's algorithm mainly
   considers original cost of the link.  Since CCDR considers cost and
   utilization simultaneously, the same path with OSPF will not be
   selected due to the severe congestion of the link (2,3).  In this
   case, f1 will select the path (p2: 1->5->6->7->8) since the new cost
   of this path is better than that of OSPF path.  Moreover, the path p2
   is also better than the path (p3: 1->2->4->7->8) for for flow f1.
   However, f2 will not select the same path since it will cause the new
   congestion in the link (6,7).  As a result, f2 will select the path
   (p3: 1->2->4->7->8).

4.2.  Topology Simulation

   The network topology mainly contains nodes and links information.
   Nodes used in the simulation have two types: core node and edge node.
   The core nodes are fully linked to each other.  The edge nodes are
   connected only with some of the core nodes.  Figure 6 is a topology
   example of 4 core nodes and 5 edge nodes.  In this CCDR simulation,
   100 core nodes and 400 edge nodes are generated.

                        Figure 6: Topology of Simulation

   The number of links connecting one edge node to the set of core nodes
   is randomly between 2 to 30, and the total number of links is more
   than 20000.  Each link has a congestion threshold.

4.3.  Traffic Matrix Simulation

   The traffic matrix is generated based on the link capacity of
   topology.  It can result in many kinds of situations, such as
   congestion, mild congestion and non-congestion.

   In the CCDR simulation, the dimension of the traffic matrix is
   500*500.  About 20% links are overloaded when the Open Shortest Path
   First (OSPF) protocol is used in the network.

4.4.  CCDR End-to-End Path Optimization

   The CCDR E2E path optimization is to find the best path which is the
   lowest in metric value and each link of the path is far below link's
   threshold.  Based on the current state of the network, the PCE within
   CCDR framework combines the shortest path algorithm with a penalty
   theory of classical optimization and graph theory.

   Given a background traffic matrix, which is unscheduled, when a set
   of new flows comes into the network, the E2E path optimization finds
   the optimal paths for them.  The selected paths bring the least
   congestion degree to the network.

   The link Utilization Increment Degree(UID), when the new flows are
   added into the network, is shown in Figure 7.  The first graph in
   Figure 7 is the UID with OSPF and the second graph is the UID with
   CCDR E2E path optimization.  The average UID of the first graph is
   more than 30%. After path optimization, the average UID is less than
   5%.  The results show that the CCDR E2E path optimization has an eye-
   catching decrease in UID relative to the path chosen based on OSPF.

4.5.  Network Temporal Congestion Elimination

   Different degrees of network congestion were simulated.  The
   Congestion Degree (CD) is defined as the link utilization beyond its
   threshold.

   The CCDR congestion elimination performance is shown in Figure 8.
   The first graph is the CD distribution before the process of
   congestion elimination.  The average CD of all congested links is
   about 20%. The second graph shown in Figure 8 is the CD distribution
   after using the congestion elimination process.  It shows only 12
   links among totally 20000 links exceed the threshold, and all the CD
   values are less than 3%. Thus, after scheduling of the traffic away

   from the congested paths, the degree of network congestion is greatly
   eliminated and the network utilization is in balance.

5.  CCDR Deployment Consideration

   feasible to find one general solution to cope with various complex
   situations.  Integrated use of a centralized controller for the more

Internet-Draft    CCDR Scenario and Simulation Results      October 2019


   complex optimal path computations in a native IP network results in
   significant improvements without impacting the underlay network
   infrastructure.

   For intra-domain or inter-domain native IP TE scenario, the
   deployment of CCDR solution is similar.  This universal deployment
   characteristic can facilitate the operator to tackle their traffic
   engineering issues in one general manner.  To deploy the CCDR
   solution, the PCE should collect the underlay network topology
   dynamically, for example via BGP-LS[RFC7752].  It also needs to
   gather the network traffic information periodically from the network
   management platform.  The simulation results show PCE can compute the
   E2E optimal path within seconds thus it can cope with the change of
   underlay network in minute scale.  More agile requirements needs
   increase the sample rate of underlay network, also decrease the
   detection and notification interval of underlay network.  The methods
   to gather and decrease the latency of these information are out of
   the scope of this draft.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document considers mainly the integration of distributed
   protocols and the central control capability of a PCE.  While it
   certainly can ease the management of network in various traffic
   engineering scenarios as described in this document, the centralized
   control also bring a new point that may be easily attacked.
   Solutions for CCDR scenarios need to consider protection of the PCE
   and communication with the underlay devices.

   [RFC5440] and [RFC8253] provide additional information.

   The control priority and interaction process should also be carefully
   designed for the combination of distributed protocol and central
   control.  Generally, the central control instruction should have
   higher priority than the forwarding actions determined by the
   distributed protocol.  When the communication between PCE and the
   underlay devices is not in function, the distributed protocol should
   take over the control right of the underlay network.
   [I-D.ietf-teas-pce-native-ip] provide more considerations
   corresponding to the solution.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any IANA actions.
