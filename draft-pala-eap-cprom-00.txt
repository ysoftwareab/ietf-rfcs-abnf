      Credentials Provisioning and Management via EAP (EAP-CPROM)
                        draft-pala-eap-cprom-00

Abstract

   With the increase number of devices, protocols, and applications that
   rely on strong credentials (e.g., digital certificates, keys, or
   tokens) for network access, the need for a standard credentials
   provisioning layer is paramount.  In particular, since EAP is
   deployed for authentication needs, the authors extend this use-case
   by including support for provisioning and management of credentials.

   In particular, this specification defines how to support the
   provisioning of strong credentials to users and/or devices without
   the need for providing IP connectivity.  The use of EAP not only for
   provisiong but also for managing network credentials provides a
   general conduit that can be exploited in different environments
   (e.g., Wired and WiFi networks credentials management).

1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Introduction

   Because of the increasing number of highly available and highly
   utilized websites that require secure communications to protect the
   flow of information from the server to the client and the raising
   number of devices (IoT) that require strong authentication
   capabilities, the need for a low-cost and efficient approach to
   network credentials management is evident.

   This specification addresses the problem of providing a simple-to-use
   and simple-to-deploy system for credentials management by extending
   the EAP protocol to support credentials provisioning and management
   functionality.

3.  Overview of existing solutions

   Currently there are many protocols that address the lifecycle of
   credentials.  In particular, when it comes to digital certificates,
   some of the most deployed management protocols are:

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document uses a new DEAP type, CPROM, whose value (TBD) MUST be
   allocated by IANA from the EAP TYPEs subregistry of the RADIUS
   registry.

7.  Security Considerations

   Several security considerations need to be explicitly considered for
   the system administrators and application developers to understand
   the weaknesses of the overall architecture.

8.  Acknowledgments

   comments and helped in the definition of the deployment
   considerations.
