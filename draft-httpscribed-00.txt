1. Introduction

    To Support pen interfaces in applications like email clients and blogging websites

2. Background
     Right now email clients that i open in available computing devices does not allow
     the user to scribble using a pen interface. I would want to mix my keyboard text
     with drawings or even hand writing. Same with blogging software.
	
3. General Information of the service
	
      I might want to draw some figures to illustrate something in my emails
      or blog. Right now theres no pen interface like mouse interface available.
      THis may need modificiations to protocols like smtp and http.
      I also propose a scribe version of httpd and smtpd or mail protocol
      daemon so pen interfaces can be used by browsers and email clients.
