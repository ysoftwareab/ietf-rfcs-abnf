Abstract 
    
   This document specifies Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 Regional Paging 
   (HMIPv6RP), a small and link-layer independent extension to the 
   Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 with regional registrations, to support 
   power-constrained operation in the mobile nodes and to reduce routing 
   state information in the visited domain.  The extension allows a 
   mobile node to enter a power saving idle mode during which its 
   location is known with the coarse accuracy defined by a paging area. 
   In the visited domain only the paging mobility anchor point (PMAP) is 
   responsible for keeping the binding cache entries for idle mobile 
   nodes and, it re-establishes the downlink routes on demand by means 
   of paging. This does not require snooping of data packets but is a 
   natural extension to network-level routing. Optionally, the mobile

   node and the visited domain can agree on time slot based paging used 
   for Paging Agent Advertisements to restrict link interface power-on 
   time in the mobile node.

      Mobile IPv6 Regional Paging        November 2000 
 
 
1. Introduction 
    
   This document specifies an extension to Mobile IPv6 [1] with 
   hierarchical mobility management [2] in order to support power-
   constrained operation and to reduce routing state information in the 
   visited domain. Some aspects of this protocol are adopted from Mobile 
   IPv4 regional paging [3]. The protocol assumes a Hierarchical Mobile 
   IPv6 network utilizing a new node called the Paging Mobility Anchor 
   Point (PMAP). The Paging Mobility Anchor Point is a MAP as in [2] 
   which is at highest distance from the mobile nodes (MN) in the 
   visited domain. The MAPs below PMAP may optionally be organized into  
   several paging areas (PA). In this case PMAP is in charge of these 
   PAs and pages the mobile node in these PAs. In the protocol hmipv6rp, 
   MN uses a Regional Care of Address (RCOA) on the MAP's subnet as its 
   own COA while roaming within a MAP's domain.   
    
   Access routers advertise paging support by including a Paging Area ID 
   extension in their Router Advertisements. A mobile node that wishes 
   to enter into idle mode sends a Binding Update or Regional Binding 
   Update with an Idle Mode Request extension to the PMAP. The PMAP 
   sends a binding acknowledgement with Idle Mode Reply extension to the 
   mobile node. After this, the binding cache entry at the intermediate 
   MAP router hierarchy is removed except at the PMAP.  
    
   The mobile node enters the active mode by performing a normal home 
   registration or a normal regional registration, i.e. binding the RCOA 
   to its on-link COA (LCOA). The network may trigger this by paging the 
   mobile node. The network pages the mobile node by sending a Router 
   Advertisement with a Paged Mobile Node Address extension called 
   Paging Router Advertisement. Time slot based paging similar to the 
   one described in [3] can optionally be used. Solicited-Node Multicast 
   Address obtained from the regional care-of-address of the mobile node 
   is used as the paging multicast address if only a single MN is to be 
   paged. If several MNs are to be paged, PMAP can assign a common 
   multicast IPv6 address allowing simultaneous paging of several MNs in 
   the same time slot.   
    
    
2. Terms 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [4]. 
    
   Idle Mode Registration 
    
   The mobile node is required to perform an idle mode registration by 
   sending a Mobile IPv6 Binding Update destination option with 
   extensions before entering the idle mode.  
    
   Paging Router Advertisement

   Access routers send in addition to the Mobile IPv6 router 
   advertisements, periodic messages called paging router advertisements 
   to the paging multicast address to page the mobile nodes in idle 
   mode. 
    
   Time Slot Based Paging 
    
   If time slot based paging is used the mobile node is paged in exact 
   time slots based on the paging slot index, paging slot offset and 
   paging slot interval values. All these values are made known to the 
   mobile node before it enters the idle mode. 
    
   Paging Mobility Anchor Point 
    
   In a hierarchical Mobile IPv6 network, the Paging Mobility Anchor 
   Point (PMAP) is the Mobility Anchor Point (MAP) which is of highest 
   distance from the MN. It is expected that there will be a single PMAP 
   per domain. 
    
   Paging Multicast Address 
    
   An IPv6 multicast address used for paging a mobile node by an access 
   router. Solicited-node multicast address obtained from the regional 
   care-of-address is the paging multicast address if the mobile node is 
   paged individually. For efficiency purposes a single paging multicast 
   address may be used to page more than one mobile node. In this case 
   the paging multicast address is an IPv6 multicast address which is 
   transient and is of global scope. 
    
   Paging Area Multicast Address 
    
   The routers below PMAP in hierarchy are organized in the form of 
   paging areas. Each region may have one or more paging areas indicated 
   by PA1, PA2, PA3,  PAn. The routers in paging area i are members of 
   the paging area multicast address i (PAMAi). A paging area multicast 
   address is an IPv6 multicast address which is permanently assigned 
   and is of global scope.  
    
3. Protocol Operation 
3.1. Paging Area Discovery 
   An access router advertises paging support with the Paging Area ID 
   extension in the Router Advertisement. The mobile node (MN) detects 
   its current paging area based on the paging area ID. Access routers 
   of neighboring cells may advertise the same paging area ID if they 
   belong to the same paging area. 
    
   When an idle MN detects that it has moved into a new paging area, it 
   MUST perform either a normal home registration, a normal regional 
   registration or an idle mode registration. 
    
   The PMAP and the routers under PMAP are organized into a hierarchy of 
   paging areas with PMAP at the root. The routers in each paging area 
   are members of an IPv6 multicast address that uniquely identifies the 
  
Sarikaya, Haverinen, Malinen, Magret Expires May 2000         [Page 4] 

      Mobile IPv6 Regional Paging        November 2000 
 
 
   paging area. The paging area multicast address is a permanent address 
   with global scope. The paging area multicast address has the form: 
   FF0E::Group-id 
   where Group-id is a 32-bit unique group id which MUST be equal to the 
   Paging Area ID. 
    
   The router advertisement MAY also contain an Advertisement Interval 
   extension which specifies the time interval between subsequent router 
   advertisements. An Advertisement Interval extension with non-zero 
   slot length field indicates support for time slot based paging within 
   the paging area. If time slot based paging is supported all access 
   routers in the same paging area send router advertisements 
   simultaneously with the same advertisement interval. 
 
   A new field in the Advertisement Interval extension indicates the 
   length of the advertisement slot in milliseconds. The advertisement 
   slot is the time during which MN powers on its receiver in order to 
   receive unsolicited Router Advertisements.  
 
   Slot sequence number is another new field in the Advertisement 
   Interval extension that is used for determining the MN's paging slot 
   as described in Section 3.2. 
    
3.2. Entering Idle Mode 
    
   When MN is sending or receiving packets it is in the active mode. 
   When MN is in active mode, the operation is exactly the same as in 
   Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 using a Regional COA on a MAP's subnet.  
    
   When MN is not actively communicating, it can enter the idle mode. 
   When in idle mode, the visited domain does not know the exact 
   location of MN. The visited domain knows the paging area of the idle 
   MN. 
    
   When MN wishes to enter the idle mode, it performs an idle mode 
   registration by sending a Regional Binding Update with an Idle Mode 
   Request extension. The destination address of the Regional Binding 
   Update with an Idle Mode extension is the PMAP. MN may also enter the 
   idle mode or extend the life time of its idle mode by way of a home 
   registration, i.e. by sending a BU with Idle Mode Request to its Home 
   Agent. If time slot based paging is used, the Idle Mode Request 
   extension contains the paging slot interval expressed as a multiple 
   of advertisement intervals. MN sends the Paging Area ID in the Idle 
   Mode Request extension. The Paging Area ID value MUST be equal to the 
   Paging Area ID advertised by the access router of the current cell of 
   MN. 
    
   When a MAP receives the Binding Update or Regional Binding Update 
   with an Idle Mode request extension, it establishes or updates its 
   regional binding cache entry for the mobile node as in Hierarchical 
   Mobile IPv6. MAPs do not maintain any tunnels or other routing 
   information for idle mode MNs in their routing tables. The Binding 
   Update or Regional Binding Update with an Idle Mode request extension 
  
Sarikaya, Haverinen, Malinen, Magret Expires May 2000         [Page 5] 

      Mobile IPv6 Regional Paging        November 2000 
 
 
   has a lifetime. MN that wishes to stay in the idle mode longer than 
   this lifetime must extend the lifetime by performing another idle 
   mode registration. MN may also extend the lifetime of its home 
   registration and yet stay in the idle mode by performing a home 
   registration with the Idle Mode Request extension. Idle mode 
   extensions are transparent to HA, i.e. HA responds only to the life 
   time extension of MN's home registration.  
    
   The operation of the PMAP upon receipt of a data packet destined to 
   an idle mode MN is specified in Section 3.3. The MAPs other than the 
   PMAP do not need to maintain any state specific to MN. That is, after 
   forwarding the Binding Acknowledgement with Idle Mode Reply extension 
   to MN, they delete MN from their binding cache.  
    
   PMAP includes an Idle Mode Reply extension to the Binding 
   Acknowledgement sent by HA or to the Regional Binding 
   Acknowledgement. PMAP keeps the binding cache for MN and adds the 
   Paging Area ID to the cache entry. The binding cache for the MN MAY 
   contain the Paging Multicast Address if PMAP decides to use a common 
   multicast address to page several MNs at the same time.  
    
   The policy of paging single or multiple MNs can be static, i.e. it 
   can be setup by the administrator or the policy can be dynamic, i.e. 
   PMAP can switch its policy back and forth in a time varying fashion. 
   The Idle Mode Reply extension optionally contains a paging multicast 
   address to be used in paging more than one MN at the same time. The 
   value of the paging multicast address is decided based on the binding 
   cache at the PMAP. The access routers use this address for paging MN 
   when they receive a Paging Request message from PMAP. 
    
   If the optional time slot based paging mechanism is used, the Idle 
   Mode Reply extension contains a paging slot index (an integer) and a 
   paging slot offset (in milliseconds) which are used in determining 
   the exact timing of the time slots in time slot based paging. The 
   paging slot instant is determined as follows: Paging slot occurs N 
   milliseconds later than every paging slot interval number of 
   unsolicited periodic router advertisements. The delay N equals paging 
   slot index times advertisement interval plus paging slot offset. The 
   paging slot interval times the Advertisement Interval is the period 
   of Paging Router Advertisements and the paging slot index and paging 
   slot offset specify the exact timing of the paging. For example, if 
   paging slot interval is 4, paging slot index is two and paging slot 
   offset is 100 ms, then there will be a paging slot during every 0th, 
   4th, 8th, etc. unsolicited router advertisement and it will exactly 
   occur 100 ms after every 2nd, 6th, 10th, etc. router advertisement. 
    
   The length (duration) of the paging slot is equal to the length of 
   the advertisement slot. Since mobile nodes can not determine the 
   exact instant of the paging slot, access routers do not send Paging 
   Router Advertisements during the first and the last quarter of the 
   paging slot.

   The sequence number field is needed in determining the paging slot. 
   Thus the new slot sequence number field is defined for this purpose. 
    
3.3. Paging 
   When PMAP receives a packet from a correspondent node destined to a 
   mobile node that has the idle mode flag set in the binding cache, 
   PMAP does not forward the packet to any lower MAP. Instead it sends a 
   Paging Request Mobile IPv6 multicast message. The destination of the 
   Paging Request message is the Paging Area Multicast Address. PMAP 
   checks its binding cache and if it does not find any Paging Multicast 
   Address then the PMAP has a single MN to page therefore it sets the 
   Paged Mobile Node Address to the regional care-of address of this MN 
   and does not include any Paging Multicast Address in the Paging 
   Request message. If PMAP finds a Paging Multicast Address in the 
   correspong binding cache entry, then many MNs need to be paged, 
   therefore PMAP MUST set this value in the Paging Multicast Address 
   field and set the regional care-of addresses of all MNs to be paged 
   in the Paged Mobile Node Addresses field. 
    
   The access routers in the Paging Area send a Paging Router 
   Advertisement to the MN if a single MN is to be paged using the 
   solicited-node multicast address obtained from the regional care-of 
   address of MN as the destination address. If many MNs are to be 
   paged, the Paging Multicast Address is used as the destination 
   address of the Paging Router Advertisement. 
    
   When time slot based paging is supported, the Paging Request contains 
   the paging slot interval, the paging slot index, and the paging slot 
   offset. Using these values the access routers in the paging area can 
   generate periodic Paging Router Advertisements until all MNs enter 
   the active mode. 
    
   If time slot based paging is used, the access routers send the Paging 
   Router Advertisements during the second and the third quarter of the 
   MN's paging slot. 
    
   The MN is expected to perform an ordinary binding update or an 
   ordinary regional binding update in response to a Paging Router 
   Advertisement. PMAP MAY transmit the Paging Request after a timeout 
   to the next paging area. The order of paging areas in which the MN is 
   to be paged is implementation specific. If MN has not performed a 
   regional binding update after paging several paging areas, PMAP 
   SHOULD send a Destination Unreachable ICMPv6 error message to the 
   correspondent node. 
    
   While waiting for the response of MN, PMAP MAY buffer the data 
   destined to MN. When MN has entered the active mode, PMAP can stop 
   buffering and forward the buffered packets to MN. PMAP discards 
   buffered packets after a timeout. 
    
3.4. Entering Active Mode

      Mobile IPv6 Regional Paging        November 2000 
 
 
   When MN receives a Paging Router Advertisement to its solicited-node 
   multicast address or to the Paging Multicast Address that MN received 
   with Binding Acknowledgement with Idle Mode Reply extension, MN 
   enters the active mode. MN can also enter active mode if it needs to 
   send a packet. 
    
   When entering the active mode, MN sends a home registration or a 
   regional registration by sending a Binding Update MIPv6 destination 
   option. This sets up the routing state in the MAPs of the 
   Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 [2]. This registration clears the idle mode 
   in PMAP and allows all subsequent data to reach MN. 
    
3.5. Dynamic PMAP Discovery 
 
   Dynamic PMAP discovery is an extension to the Dynamic MAP discovery 
   of Hierarchical MIPv6 [2]. As in [2], the access routers are required 
   to send the MAP option in all router advertisements. MN selects the 
   MAP whose distance is the highest as its current PMAP and stores the 
   global IPv6 address of this MAP. When, in the subsequent router 
   advertisements, another MAP with a distance greater than the current 
   PMAP is advertised, MN replaces the current PMAP with the new highest 
   distance PMAP. When going to the idle mode, MN sends its Regional 
   Registration message (Binding Update with Idle Mode Request 
   extension) to the current PMAP. 
 
4. Protocol Extensions 
    
    
4.1. Advertisement Interval Extension 
    
   The base Mobile IPv6 protocol's Advertisement Interval option for 
   Router Advertisement messages is extended to optionally include slot 
   length and slot sequence number.

   Length 
    
        8-bit unsigned integer.  The length of the option (including 
        the type and length fields) in units of 8 octets.  The value of 
        this field MUST be 2.

   Slot Length 
         
        16-bit unsigned integer. Indicates the length in milliseconds of 
        the advertisement slot during which the mobile nodes activate 
        their receivers in order to receive Paging Router 
        Advertisements, if time slot based paging is supported. The 
        router advertisement MUST also include a Paging Area ID 
        extension if the Slot Length is non-zero. If this field is zero, 
        it indicates that the Paging Area does not support time slot 
        based paging. 
    
   Advertisement Interval 
    
        32-bit unsigned integer. The time in milliseconds (not the 
        maximum time as in the base Mobile IPv6) between two successive 
        unsolicited router advertisement messages sent by this access 
        router on this network interface. 
    
   Slot Sequence Number 
         
        16-bit unsigned integer. This field is included if time slot 
        based paging is supported. The slot sequence number in each 
        unsolicited Router Advertisement is one greater than in the 
        previous unsolicited Router Advertisement. The slot sequence 
        number is used to determine mobile node's paging slot, as 
        specified in Section 3.2. 
    
4.2 Paging Area ID Extension 
    
   Mobile IPv6 Router Advertisement messages may contain a Paging Area 
   ID Extension.  
   The Paging Area ID extension is defined as follows: 
 
   0                   1                   2                   3

        TBD  
    
   Length 
    
        The length (in octets) of the Paging Area ID field. The length 
        of the option (including the type and length fields) in units of 
        8 octets. The value of this field must be 1.

   Paging Area ID 
    
        A 32-bit identifier. The access router that supports regional 
        paging indicates the support by including the Paging Area ID 
        extension in the Router Advertisement message. If present, the 
        Paging Area ID extension MUST appear in the Router Advertisement 
        message after any of the advertisement extensions defined in

        data fields not including the type and length fields. 
      
   Paging Slot Index 
        16-bit unsigned integer. This field is optional. The value is 
        assigned by the paging mobility anchor point if time slot based 
        paging is used. Paging slot index value is used in determining  
        the mobile node's paging slot. 
 
   Paging Slot Offset 
    
        16-bit unsigned integer. This field is optional. The value is 
        assigned by the paging mobility anchor point if time slot based 
        paging is used. Paging slot offset value is used in determining  
        the mobile node's paging slot. 
 
   Paging Multicast Address 
 
        IPv6 multicast address used for paging the mobile node. This 
        value is optional and is used only when more than one mobile 
        node is needed to be paged at the same time in the same paging 
        area. If this value is absent then the mobile node is paged 
        using the solicited node multicast address obtained from its 
        regional care-of address. 
      
4.5 Paging Request Message 
 
   When paging a mobile node, the Paging Mobility Anchor Point sends a 
   Paging Request Message which is a destination option to the multicast

        There MAY be more than one MN addresses in this field. 
 
5. IANA Considerations  
    
   HMIPv6RP requires a new IPv6 destination option to be used for 
   sending the Paging Request message (Section 4.5).  
   HMIPv6RP requires 3 new extension types to be used in combination 
   with router advertisements: a type for Advertisement Interval 
   extension (Section 4.1), a type for Paging Area ID extension (Section 
   4.2), a type for Paged Mobile Node Address extension (Section 4.6). 
    
   HMIPv6RP requires two new types to be used in combination with the 
   Binding Update or Binding Acknowledgement destination options: a type 
   for the Idle Mode Request extension (Section 4.3) and a type for the 
   Idle Mode Reply extension (Section 4.4).

6. Security Considerations 
   HMIPv6RP uses the same security mechanisms as in Hierarchical MIPv6 
   [2].  More specifically the Idle Mode registration is protected by 
   IPsec and its authentication header using the mobile-visited-domain 
   key. Details of security, such as regional authorization, key 
   distribution, and replay protection are out of the scope of this 
   document.
