Carugi et al    Informational - Expires September 2002               4                Service requirements for Layer 3 PPVPNs     March, 2002 
 
 
    
1 Introduction 
   This section describes the scope and outline of the document. 
    
1.1 Scope of this document 
   This document provides requirements for Layer 3 Provider Provisioned 
   Virtual Private Networks (ppvpn). It identifies requirements that may 
   apply to one or more individual approaches that a Service Provider 
   may use for the provisioning of a Layer 3 (e.g., IP) VPN service. The 
   document states requirements from a general point of view, as well as 
   from a customer and service provider point of view. The content of 
   this document makes use of the terminologies and common components 
   for deploying Layer 3 PPVPNs defined in [PPVPN-FR].  Unless otherwise 
   stated, the term "PPVPN" used in this document specifically refers to 
   Layer 3 PPVPNs, and Layer 2 PPVPN requirements are not included here. 
    
   The specification of any technical means to provide PPVPN services is 
   outside the scope of this document. Other documents, such as the 
   framework document [PPVPN-FR] and several sets of documents, one set 
   per each individual technical approach providing PPVPN services, are 
   intended to cover this aspect. 
    
   This document discusses two types of PPVPNs: BGP-VPNs (e.g. RFC 2547) 
   and virtual routers.  Requirements for port-based VPNs (i.e., where 
   the SP provides a Layer 2 interface, such as Frame Relay ATM, or 
   Ethernet to the VPN customer, while using IP-based mechanisms in the 
   provider infrastructure to improve scalability and configurability 
   over traditional L2 networks)will be collected in other documents. 
   The approach followed in this document distinguishes PPVPN types as 
   to where the endpoints of tunnels exist. Terminology regarding 
   whether equipment faces a customer or the service provider network is 
   used to define the various types of PPVPN solutions.  
    
   This document does not map requirements to each individual approach. 
   Rather, it's intended use is as a "checklist" of requirements that 
   will provide a consistent way to evaluate and document how well each 
   individual approach satisfies specific requirements. The relevant 
   documents for each individual approach should document the results of 
   this evaluation. 
    
   This document provides requirements from several points of view. It 
   begins with the general, followed by a customer perspective, and 
   concludes with specific needs of a Service Provider (SP). These 
   requirements provide high-level PPVPN features expected by an SP in 
   provisioning PPVPN to make them beneficial to his customers. These 
   general requirements include SP requirements for security, privacy, 
   manageability, interoperability and scalability, including service 
   provider projections for number, complexity, and rate of change of 
   customer VPNs over the next several years.

1.2 Outline 
   The outline of the rest of this document is as follows. Section 2 
   defines terminology. Section 3 provides general requirements that 
   apply to both customer and service providers. Section 4 states 
   requirements from a customer perspective. Section 5 states network 
   requirements from a service provider perspective. Section 6 states 
   service provider management requirements. Section 7 describes 
   security considerations. Section 8 lists acknowledgements. Section 9 
   provides a list of references cited herein. Section 10 lists the 
   author's addresses. 
    
2 Definitions 
   This section provides the definition of terms and concepts used 
   throughout the document. 
    
2.1 Virtual Private Network Components 
   This document uses the word _private_ in VPN in the sense of 
   ownership, which is different from the use of the similar word 
   _privacy_ used in discussions regarding security. The term _virtual 
   private_ means that the offered service retains at least some aspects 
   of a privately owned customer network. 
    
   The term "Virtual Private Network" (VPN) refers to the communication 
   between a set of sites, making use of a shared network 
   infrastructure. Multiple sites of a private network may therefore 
   communicate via the public infrastructure, in order to facilitate the 
   operation of the private network. The logical structure of the VPN, 
   such as topology, addressing, connectivity, reachability, and access 
   control, is equivalent to part of or all of a conventional private 
   network using private facilities.  
    
   The term _Provider Provisioned VPN_ refers to VPNs for which the 
   service provider participates in management and provisioning of the 
   VPN. 
    
2.2 Users, Sites, Customers and Agents 
   User: A user is an entity (e.g., a human being using a host, a 
   server, or a system) that has been authorized to use a VPN service. 
    
   Site: A site is a set of users that have mutual IP reachability 
   without use of a specific service provider network. A site may 
   consist of a set of users that are in geographic proximity.  However, 
   two geographic locations connected via another provider's network 
   would also constitute a single site since communication between the 
   two locations does not involve the use of the service provider 
   offering the VPN service. 
    
   Customer: A single organization, corporation, or enterprise that 
   administratively controls a set of sites. 
    
   Agent: A set of users designated by a customer who has the 
   authorization to manage a customer's VPN service offering.

2.3 Intranets, Extranets, and VPNs 
    
   Intranet: An intranet restricts communication to a set of sites that 
   belong to one customer. An example is branch offices at different 
   sites that require communication to a headquarters site.  
    
   Extranet: An extranet allows the specification of communication 
   between a set of sites that belong to different customers. In other 
   words, two or more organizations have access to a specified set of 
   each other's sites.  Examples of an extranet scenario include 
   multiple companies cooperating in joint software development, a 
   service provider having access to information from the vendors' 
   corporate sites, different companies, or universities participating 
   in a consortium.   
    
   Note that an intranet or extranet can exist across a single service 
   provider network or across multiple service providers.  
    
   Virtual Private Network (VPN): The term VPN is used within this 
   document to refer to a specific set of sites as either an intranet or 
   an extranet that have been configured to allow communication. Note 
   that a site is a member of at least one VPN, and may be a member of 
   many VPNs.  
    
2.4 Networks of Customer and Provider Devices 
   Service provider PPVPNs are composed of the following types of 
   devices. 
    
   Customer Edge (CE) device: A CE device faces the users at a customer 
   site that has an access connection to a PE device. It may be a router 
   switching-router, or a switch that allows users at a customer site to 
   communicate over the access network with other sites in the VPN. In a 
   CE-based PPVPN, the service provider manages (at least partially) the 
   CE device. 
    
   Provider Edge (PE) device: A PE device faces the provider network on 
   one side and attaches via an access connection over one or more 
   access networks to one or more CE devices. It may be a router or a 
   switching-router.  
    
   The term switching-router (SR) is used in this document as a 
   generalization of the Label Switching Router (LSR) term defined in 
   RFC 3031. As described in the next section, MPLS is one of several 
   tunneling techniques that may be used in a PPVPN, therefore, in this 
   document the "Label" adjective is dropped, leaving only the more 
   generic Switching Router (SR) terminology. The router part of the 
   term applies since all PPVPN services are supported by a routing 
   infrastructure. The switching term applies to L2 services or use of 
   switching technologies (e.g., MPLS) in support of L3 services.

   Note that the definitions of Customer Edge and Provider Edge do not 
   necessarily map to the physical deployment of equipment on customer 
   premises or a provider point of presence.  
    
   Provider (P) device: A device within a provider network that 
   interconnects PE devices, but does not have any direct attachment to 
   CE devices or keeps a minimal amount of VPN state (preferably none). 
    
   Service Provider (SP) network: An SP network is a set of 
   interconnected PE and P devices administered by a single service 
   provider.  
    
2.5 Access Networks, Tunnels, and Hierarchical Tunnels  
   VPNs are built between CEs using access networks, tunnels, and 
   hierarchical tunnels.  
    
   Access connection: An access connection provides connectivity between 
   a CE and a PE. This includes PPP over dedicated physical circuits, as 
   well as logical circuits, such as Ethernet, frame Relay or ATM, or IP 
   tunnels (e.g., IPsec, L2TP).  
    
   Access network: An access network provides access connections between 
   CE and PE devices.  It may be a TDM network, L2 network (e.g. FR, 
   ATM, and Ethernet), or an IP network over which access is tunneled 
   (e.g., using L2TP [RFC2661]).  
    
   Tunnel: A tunnel between two entities is formed by encapsulating 
   packets within another encapsulating header for purpose of 
   transmission between those two entities in support of a VPN 
   application. Examples of protocols commonly used for tunneling are: 
   MPLS, GRE, IPsec, and IP-in-IP tunnels.  
    
   Hierarchical Tunnel: Encapsulating one tunnel within another forms a 
   hierarchical tunnel. Note that the tunneling protocols need not be 
   the same in a hierarchical tunnel. In the context of VPNs, a 
   hierarchical tunnel is a logical association between two entities 
   (e.g., a CE or PE switching-router or router) defined by the 
   innermost tunnel protocol header in a hierarchical tunnel [VPN 
   TUNNEL]. For reasons of efficiency, some VPN solutions use 
   hierarchical tunnels between PE routers to reduce the number of 
   tunnels seen by P routers in the backbone.  
    
 
2.6 Layer 3 VPNs and Virtual Forwarding Instances 
   In a layer 3 VPN service, a customer site receives IP layer (i.e., 
   layer 3) service from the SP. The PE is attached via an access 
   connection to one or more CEs. The PE performs forwarding of user 
   data packets based on information in the IP layer header, such as an 
   IPv4 or IPv6 destination address. The CE sees the PE as a layer 3 
   device such as an IPv4 or IPv6 router.

   Virtual Forwarding Instance (VFI): In a layer 3 VPN service, the PE 
   contains a VFI for each L3 VPN that it serves. The VFI terminates 
   tunnels for interconnection with other VFIs and also terminates 
   access connections for accommodating CEs. VFI contains information 
   regarding how to forward data received over the access connection to 
   the CE to VFIs in other PEs supporting the same L3 VPN. The VFI 
   includes the router information base and forwarding information base 
   for a L3 VPN. A VFI enables router functions dedicated to serving a 
   particular VPN.  Routing protocols in the PEs and the CEs interact to 
   populate the VFI.  
    
   The following narrative and figures provide further explanation of 
   the way PE devices use tunnels and hierarchical tunnels. Figure 2.1 
   illustrates the case where a PE uses a separate tunnel for each VPN. 
   As shown in the figure, the tunnels provide communication between the 
   virtual switching/forwarding instance in each of the PE devices.

   Figure 2.2 illustrates the case where a single hierarchical tunnel is 
   used between PE devices to support communication for VPNs. The 
   innermost encapsulating protocol header provides the means for the PE 
   to determine the VPN for which the packet is directed. This method is 
   preferable since it requires support for fewer tunnels by the P 
   switching routers in a service provider backbone.

2.7 Customer and Provider Network Management 
   Customer Network Management Function: A Customer network management 
   function provides the means for a customer agent to query or 
   configure customer specific information, or receive alarms regarding 
   his or her VPN. Customer specific information includes data related 
   to contact, billing, site, access network, IP address, routing 
   protocol parameters, etc. It may also include confidential data, such 
   as encryption keys. It may use a combination of proprietary network 
   management system, SNMP manager, or directory service (e.g., LDAP 
   [RFC1777] [RFC2251]). 
    
   Provider Network Management Function: A provider network management 
   function provides many of the same capabilities as a customer network 
   management system across all customers. This would not include 
   customer confidential information, such as keying material. The 
   intent of giving the provider a view comparable to that of customer 
   network management is to aid in troubleshooting and problem 
   resolution. Such a system also provides the means to query, 
   configure, or receive alarms regarding any infrastructure supporting 
   the PPVPN service. It may use a combination of proprietary network 
   management system, SNMP manager, or directory service (e.g., LDAP 
   [RFC1777] [RFC2251]).   
    
2.8 Taxonomy for L3 PPVPN Types 
   The taxonomy of PPVPN types is primarily determined by whether the 
   tunnels that provide the service either terminate on Customer Edge 
   (CE), or on Provider Edge (PE) devices, as defined in section 2.4.  
    
   A CE-based VPN is one in which knowledge of L3 aspects of the 
   customer network is limited to CE devices. Customer sites are 
   interconnected via tunnels or nested tunnels. The SP backbone is 
   unaware of the existence of the VPN. 
    
   A PE-based VPN is one in which the SP backbone is aware of (i.e., 
   maintains state information for) the VPN, and provides a layer 3 

 
Carugi et al    Informational - Expires September 2002              10                Service requirements for Layer 3 PPVPNs     March, 2002 
 
 
   service that routes packets between customer sites using the customer 
   network's address space. 
    
   A CE-based L3 VPN is a CE-based VPN where the service provided 
   by the CE equipment to the customer sites is a network 
   layer (i.e.,layer 3) service. 
    
   A PE-based L3 VPN is one in which the SP backbone is aware 
   of the VPN, and provides a layer 3 service that routes packets 
   between customer sites using the customer network's address space. 
    
   The Layer 3 PPVPN framework document [PPVPN-FR] further describes 
   these concepts in the context of a reference model that defines 
   layered service relationships between devices and one or more levels 
   of tunnels. 
 
3 General Service Requirements 
   This section contains requirements that apply to both the customer 
   and the provider, or are of an otherwise general nature. 
    
3.1 Traffic Types 
   PPVPN services must support unicast traffic and should support 
   multicast traffic.  It is highly desirable to support L3 multicast 
   limited in scope to an intranet or extranet. The solution should be 
   able to support a large number of such intranet or extranet specific 
   multicast groups in a scalable manner. 
    
3.2 Topology 
   A PPVPN should support arbitrary, customer agent defined inter-site 
   connectivity, ranging, for example, from hub-and-spoke, partial mesh 
   to full mesh topology. To the extent possible, a PPVPN service should 
   be independent of the geographic extent of the deployment.  
    
   A PPVPN should support multiple VPNs per customer site. 
    
   To the extent possible, the PPVPN services should independent of 
   access network technology.  
    
3.3 Isolated Exchange of Data and Routing Information 
   A mechanism for isolating the distribution of reachability 
   information to only those sites associated with a VPN must be 
   provided.  
    
   A mechanism to exchange reachability information with equipment at 
   customer sites within a VPN must be provided. 
    
   PPVPN solutions shall define means that [VPN-CRIT] prevent routers in 
   a VPN from interaction with unauthorized entities and avoid 
   introducing undesired routing information that could corrupt the VPN 
   routing information base. 
    

 
Carugi et al    Informational - Expires September 2002              11                Service requirements for Layer 3 PPVPNs     March, 2002 
 
 
   A means to constrain, or isolate, the distribution of addressed data 
   to only those VPN sites determined either by routing data and/or 
   configuration must be provided.  
    
   A single site shall be capable of being in multiple VPNs. The VPN 
   solution must ensure that traffic is exchanged only with those sites 
   that are in the same VPN. 
    
   The internal structure of the VPN should be invisible to the 
   Internet. 
    
   Note that isolation of forwarded data and/or exchange of reachability 
   information to only those sites that are part of a VPN may be viewed 
   as a form of security, for example, [Y.1311.1],[MPLS SEC]. 
    
3.4 Security 
   A range of security features should be supported by the suite of 
   PPVPN solutions [VPN SEC]. Each PPVPN solution should state which 
   security features it supports and how such features can be configured 
   on a per customer basis. 
    
3.4.1  User data security   
   PPVPN solutions that support user data security should use standard 
   methods (e.g., IPsec) to achieve confidentiality, integrity, 
   authentication and replay attack prevention. 
    
3.4.2  Access control 
   A PPVPN solution may also have the ability to activate the 
   appropriate filtering capabilities upon request of a customer [VPN-
   NEEDS]. A filter provides a mechanism so that access control can be 
   invoked at the point(s) of communication between different 
   organizations involved in an extranet. Access control can be 
   implemented by a firewall, access control lists on routers or similar 
   mechanisms to apply policy-based access control to transit traffic.  
 
3.4.3  Site authentication and authorization 
    
   A L3 VPN solution requires authentication and authorization of the 
   following: 
    - temporary and permanent access for users connecting to sites 
   (authentication and authorization BY the site) 
    - the site itself (authentication and authorization FOR the site) 
    
3.5 Addressing 
   An L3 VPN service shall support overlapping customer addresses, for 
   example non-unique private IP addresses [RFC1918].  
    
   IP addresses must be unique within the set of sites reachable from 
   the VPNs of which a particular site is a member. 
    
   A VPN solution should be easily extendable to support both IPv4 and 
   IPv6. 
 
Carugi et al    Informational - Expires September 2002              12                Service requirements for Layer 3 PPVPNs     March, 2002 
 
 
    
   A VPN service should be capable of translating customer private IP 
   addresses for communicating with IP systems having public addresses. 
    
   A VPN service may be capable of supporting non-IP customer addresses 
   (e.g., IPX, Appletalk). If a VPN service supports such addresses, 
   then it should be capable of translating customer private addresses 
   for the purpose of communicating with systems having public 
   addresses. 
    
   FR and ATM link layer identifiers (i.e., DLCI and VPI/VCI) shall be 
   unique only on a physical interface basis.  
    
   Normally, Ethernet MAC addresses on access connections are globally 
   unique.  
    
3.6 Quality of Service 
   To the extent possible, L3 VPN QoS should be independent of the 
   access network technology.  
    
3.6.1  QoS Standards 
   According to the PPVPN charter, a non-goal is the development of new 
   protocols or extension of existing ones. Therefore, with regards to 
   QoS support, a PPPVN shall be able to support QoS in one or more of 
   the following already standardized modes: 
     - Best Effort  (support mandatory for all PPVPN types) 
     - Aggregate CE Interface Level QoS (i.e., _hose_ level) 
     - Site-to-site, or _pipe_ level QoS 
     - Intserv (i.e., RSVP) signaled  
     - Diffserv marked 
     - Across packet-switched access networks 
      
   Note that all cases involving QoS may require that the CE and/or PE 
   perform shaping and/or policing.  
    
   PPVPN CE should be capable of supporting integrated services 
   (Intserv) for certain customers in support of session applications, 
   such as switched voice or video. Intserv-capable CE devices shall 
   support the following Internet standards: 
     - Resource reSerVation Protocol (RSVP) [RFC 2205] 
     - Guaranteed Quality of Service providing a strict delay bound 
       [RFC 2212] 
     -Controlled Load Service providing performance equivalent to that 
   of an unloaded network [RFC 2211] 
      
   PPVPN CE and PE should be capable of supporting differentiated 
   service (diffserv). In diffserv Per Hop Behavior PHB - a description 
   of the externally observable forwarding behavior of a DS node applied 
   to a particular DS behavior aggregate [RFC 2475].  Diffserv-capable 
   PPVPN CE and PE shall support the following per hop behavior (PHB) 
   types: 

 
Carugi et al    Informational - Expires September 2002              13                Service requirements for Layer 3 PPVPNs     March, 2002 
 
 
     - Expedited Forwarding (EF) - the departure rate of an aggregate 
   class of traffic from a router that must equal or exceed a configured 
   rate [RFC 2598 bis]. 
     - Assured Forwarding (AF) - is a means for a provider DS domain to 
   offer different levels of forwarding assurances for IP packets 
   received from a customer DS domain.  Four AF classes are defined, 
   where each AF class is in each DS node allocated a certain amount of 
   forwarding resources (e.g., buffer space and bandwidth) [RFC 2597]. 
    
   A customer, CE, or PE device supporting a L3 VPN service may classify 
   a packet for a particular Intserv or Diffserv service based on upon 
   one or more of the following IP header fields: protocol ID, source 
   port number, destination port number, destination address, or source 
   address.   
    
   For TCP traffic, L3 PPVPN devices should support Random Early 
   Detection (RED) to provide graceful degradation in the event of 
   network congestion. 
      
   The need to provide QoS will occur primarily in the access network, 
   since that will often be the bottleneck. This is likely to occur 
   since the backbone effectively statistically multiplexes many users, 
   is traffic engineered, and in some cases also includes capacity for 
   restoration and growth. There are two directions of QoS management 
   that must be considered in any PPVPN service regarding QoS: 
     - From the CE across the access network to the PE 
     - From the PE across the access network to CE 
      
   PPVPN CE and PE devices should be capable of supporting QoS across a 
   subset of the access networks defined in section 4.11, such as: 
     - ATM Virtual Connections (VCs) 
     - Frame Relay Data Link Connection Identifiers (DLCIs) 
     - 802.1d Prioritized Ethernet 
     - MPLS-based access 
     - Multilink Multiclass PPP 
     - QoS-enabled wireless (e.g., LMDS, MMDS) 
     - Cable modem [DOCSIS 1.1] 
     - QoS-enabled Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) 
    
3.6.2  Service Models 
   A service provider must be able to offer QoS service to a customer 
   for at least the following generic service types: managed access VPN 
   service or an edge-to-edge QoS service.  
    
   A managed access VPN service provides QoS on the access connection 
   between the CE and the PE. As an example for a L3 PPVPN service, 
   diffserv would be enabled only on the CE router and the customer-
   facing ports of the PE router. Note that this service would not 
   require implementation of DiffServ in the SP IP backbone. The SP may 
   use policing for inbound traffic at the PE. The CE may perform 
   shaping for outbound traffic. Another example of a managed access L3 
   VPN service is where the SP performs the packet classification and 
 
Carugi et al    Informational - Expires September 2002              14                Service requirements for Layer 3 PPVPNs     March, 2002 
 
 
   diffserv marking. An SP may provide several packet classification 
   profiles that customers may select, or may offer a service that 
   offers custom profiles based upon customer specific requirements. In 
   general, more complex QoS policies should be left to the customer for 
   implementation. 
    
   An edge-to-edge QoS VPN service provides QoS from provider edge to 
   provider edge. The provider edge may be either PE or CE depending 
   upon the service demarcation point between the provider and the 
   customer. Such a service may be provided across one or more provider 
   backbones. The CE requirements for this service model are the same as 
   the managed access VPN service. However, in this service QoS is 
   provided from one edge of the SP network(s) to the other edge. 
    
3.7 Service Level Specification and Agreements 
   A Service Level Specification (SLS) may be defined per access network 
   connection, per VPN, per VPN site, and/or per VPN route. The service 
   provider may define objectives and the measurement interval for at 
   least the SLS using the following Service Level Objective (SLO) 
   parameters: 
    
     O QoS and traffic parameters for the Intserv flow or Diffserv class 
     O Availability for the site, VPN, or access connection 
     O Duration of outage intervals per site, route or VPN 
     O Service activation interval (e.g., time to turn up a new site) 
     O Trouble report response time interval 
     O Time to repair interval 
     O Total traffic offered to the site, route or VPN 
     O Measure of non-conforming traffic for the site, route or VPN 
    
   The above list contains items from [Y.1241], as well as other items 
   typically part of SLAs for currently deployed VPN services [FRF.13]. 
   See RFC 3198 for generic definitions of SLS, SLA, and SLO. 
    
   The provider network management system shall measure, and report as 
   necessary, whether measured performance meets or fails to meet the 
   above SLS objectives. 
    
   The service provider and the customer may negotiate a contractual 
   arrangement that includes a Service Level Agreement (SLA) regarding 
   compensation if the provider does not meet an SLS performance 
   objective. Details of such compensation are outside the scope of this 
   document. 
    
   SLS measurements for quality based on the DiffServ scheme should be 
   based upon the following classification [Y.1311.1]: 
    
     A Point-to-Point SLS, sometimes also referred to as the "Pipe" 
     model, defines traffic parameters in conjunction with the QoS 
     objectives for traffic exchanged between a pair of VPN sites (i.e., 
     points). A Point-to-Point SLS is analogous to the SLS typically 
     supported over point-to-point Frame Relay or ATM PVCs or an edge-
 
Carugi et al    Informational - Expires September 2002              15                Service requirements for Layer 3 PPVPNs     March, 2002 
 
 
     to-edge MPLS tunnel. The set of SLS specifications to all other 
     reachable VPN sites would define the overall Point-to-Point SLS for 
     a specific site. 
    
     A Point-to-Cloud SLS, sometimes also referred as the "Hose" model, 
     defines traffic parameters in conjunction with the QoS objectives 
     for traffic exchanged between a CE and a PE for traffic destined to 
     a set (either all or a subset) of other sites in the VPN (i.e., the 
     cloud), as applicable. In other words, a point-to-cloud SLS defines 
     compliance in terms of all packets transmitted from a given VPN 
     site toward the SP network on an aggregate basis (i.e., regardless 
     of the destination VPN site of each packet).  
    
     A Cloud-to-Point SLS, is the case where flows originating from 
     multiple sources may congest the interface from the network toward 
     a specific site, which this SLS does not cover. 
    
   Traffic parameters and actions should be defined for packets to and 
   from the demarcation between the service provider and the site. For 
   example, policing may be defined on ingress and shaping on egress. 
    
3.8 Management 
   An SP and its customers must be able to manage the capabilities and 
   characteristics of their VPN services. To the extent possible, 
   automated operations and interoperability with standard management 
   platforms should be supported.   
    
   The ITU-T Telecommunications Management Network (TMN) model has the 
   following generic requirements structure: 
     O Engineer, deploy and manage the switching, routing and 
     transmission resources supporting the service, from a network 
     perspective (network element management); 
     O Manage the VPNs deployed over these resources (network 
     management); 
     o Manage the VPN service (service management);  
     o Manage the VPN business, mainly provisioning    administrative 
     and accounting information related to the VPN service customers 
     (business management). 
    
   Service management should include the TMN 'FCAPS' functionalities, as 
   follows: Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Provisioning, and 
   Security, as detailed in section 6.  
    
3.9 Interoperability 
   Each technical solution should support the Internet standards (in 
   terms of compatibility and modularity). 
    
   Multi-vendor interoperability at network element, network and service 
   levels among different implementations of the same technical solution 
   should be guaranteed (that will likely rely on the completeness of 
   the corresponding standard). This is a central requirement for SPs 
   and customers. 
 
Carugi et al    Informational - Expires September 2002              16                Service requirements for Layer 3 PPVPNs     March, 2002 
 
 
    
   The technical solution must be multi-vendor interoperable not only 
   within the SP network infrastructure, but also with the customer's 
   network equipment and services making usage of the PPVPN service. 
    
3.10 Interworking 
   Service interworking among different solutions providing PPVPN 
   services is highly desirable. It should be supported in a scalable 
   manner.  
    
   Interworking scenarios must consider at least traffic and routing 
   isolation, security, QoS, access, and management aspects. This 
   requirement is essential in the case of network migration, to ensure 
   service continuity among sites belonging to different portions of the 
   network. 
    
4 Customer Requirements 
   The general requirements of section 3 apply to all customers. This 
   section captures additional requirements that are specific to a 
   customer perspective. 
    
4.1 VPN Membership (Intranet/Extranet) 
   When an extranet is formed, a customer agent from each of the 
   organizations must approve addition of a site to an extranet VPN. The 
   intent of this requirement is to ensure that both organizations 
   approve extranet communication before the PPVPN allows exchange of 
   traffic and routing information. 
    
4.2 Service Provider Independence 
   Customers may require VPN service that spans multiple administrative 
   domains or service provider networks. Therefore, a VPN service must 
   be able to span multiple AS and SP networks, but still act and appear 
   as a single, homogenous VPN from a customer point of view.  
    
   A customer might also start with a VPN provided in a single AS with a 
   certain SLA but then ask for an expansion of the service spanning 
   multiple ASs/SPs. In this case, as well as for all kinds of multi-
   AS/SP VPNs, VPN service should be able to deliver the same SLA to all 
   sites in a VPN regardless of the AS/SP to which it homes.  
    
4.3 Addressing 
   A customer requires support from a L3 VPN for the following 
   addressing IP assignment schemes:  
     o customer assigned, non-unique, or RFC 1918 private addresses 
     o globally unique addresses obtained by the customer from IANA 
     o globally unique addresses statically assigned by the PPVPN 
     service provider 
     o on-demand, dynamically assigned IP addresses (e.g., DHCP), 
     irrespective of whether the access is temporary (e.g., remote) or 
     permanent (i.e., dedicated) 
    

 
Carugi et al    Informational - Expires September 2002              17                Service requirements for Layer 3 PPVPNs     March, 2002 
 
 
   In the case of combined L3 PPVPN service with non-unique or private 
   addresses and Internet access, mechanisms that permit the exchange of 
   traffic between the customer's private address space and the global 
   unique Internet address space must be supported, for example, NAT.   
     
4.4 Routing Protocol Support 
   There should be no restriction on the routing protocols used between 
   CE and PE routers, or between CE routers. At least the following 
   protocols must be supported: static routing, IGP, such as RIP, OSPF, 
   IS-IS, or BGP [PPVPN-FR]. 
    
4.5 Quality of Service and Traffic Parameters 
   QoS is expected to be an important aspect of a PPVPN service for some 
   customers. QoS requirements cover scenarios involving an intranet, an 
   extranet, as well as shared access between a VPN site and the 
   Internet. 
    
4.5.1  Application Level QoS Objectives 
   A customer is concerned primarily that the PPVPN service provide his 
   or her application has the QoS and level of traffic such that the 
   application performs acceptably. Pseudo-wires (e.g., SONET emulation) 
   voice and interactive video, and multimedia applications are expected 
   to require the most stringent QoS. These real-time applications are 
   sensitive to delay, delay variation, loss, availability and/or 
   reliability. Another set of applications requires near real time 
   performance. Examples are multimedia, interactive video, high-
   performance web browsing and file transfer intensive applications. 
   Finally, best effort applications are not sensitive to degradation. 
   That is, they are elastic and can adapt to conditions of degraded 
   performance. 
    
   The selection of appropriate QoS and service type to meet specific 
   application requirements is particularly important to deal with 
   periods of congestion in a SP network. Sensitive applications will 
   likely select per-flow Integrated service (Intserv) with precise SLA 
   guarantees measured on a per flow basis. On the other hand, non-
   sensitive applications will likely rely on a Differentiated service 
   (Diffserv) class-based QoS. 
    
   The fundamental customer application requirement is that a PPVPN 
   solution must support both the Intserv QoS model for selected 
   individual flows, and Diffserv for aggregated flows.     
    
   A customer application should experience consistent QoS independent 
   of the access network technology used at different sites connected to 
   the same VPN. 
    
4.5.2  DSCP Transparency 
   The Diffserv Code Point (DSCP) set by a user as received by the 
   ingress CE should be capable of being relayed transparently to the 
   egress CE [Y.1311.1]. Although RFC 2475 states that interior or

   boundary nodes within a provider's Diffserv domain may change the 
   DSCP, customer VPNs may have other requirements, such as: 
     o Applications that use the DSCP in a manner differently than the 
     DSCP solution supported by the SP network(s); 
     o Customers using more DSCPs within their sites than the SP 
     network(s) supports; 
     o Support for a carriers' carrier service where one SP is the 
     customer of another PPVPN SP. Such an SP should be able to resell 
     VPN service to his or her VPN customers independently of the DSCP 
     mapping solution supported by the carriers' carrier SP. 
      
   Note that support for DSCP transparency has no implication on the QoS 
   or SLA requirements. If an SP supports DSCP transparency, then that 
   SP needs to only carry the DSCP values across its domain, but may map 
   the received DSCP to some other value for QoS support across its 
   domain. 
    
4.6 Service Level Specification/Agreement 
   Most customers simply want their applications to perform well. An SLA 
   is a vehicle for customer recourse in the event that SP(s) do not 
   perform or manage a VPN service well in a measurable sense. 
   Therefore, when purchasing service under an SLA, a customer agent 
   must have access to the measures from the SP(s) that support the SLA.    
    
4.7 Customer Management of a VPN 
   A customer must have a means to view the topology, operational state, 
   order status, and other parameters associated with his or her VPN.  
    
   All aspects of management information about CE devices and customer 
   attributes of a PPVPN manageable by an SP should be capable of being 
   configured and maintained by an authenticated, authorized customer 
   agent.   
    
   A customer agent should be able to make dynamic requests for changes 
   to traffic parameters. A customer should be able to receive real-time 
   response from the SP network in response to these requests.  One 
   example of such as service is a "Dynamic Bandwidth management" 
   capability, that enables real-time response to customer requests for 
   changes of allocated bandwidth allocated to their VPN(s)[Y.1311.1].  
    
   A customer who may not be able to afford the resources to manage 
   their own sites should be able to outsource the management of his or 
   her VPN to the service provider(s) supporting the network.   
    
4.8 Isolation 
   These features include traffic and routing information exchange 
   isolation, similar to that obtained in VPNs based on Layer 1 and 
   Layer 2 (e.g, private lines, FR, or ATM) [MPLS SEC]. 
    
4.9 Security 
   The suite of PPVPN solutions should support a range of security 
   related features.  Higher levels of security services, like edge-to-
 
Carugi et al    Informational - Expires September 2002              19                Service requirements for Layer 3 PPVPNs     March, 2002 
 
 
   edge encryption, authentication, or replay attack should be 
   supported. 
    
   Security in a PPVPN service should be as transparent as possible to 
   the customer, with the obvious exception of support for remote or 
   temporary user access, as detailed in section 4.11.2.  
    
   PPVPN customers must be able to deploy their own internal security 
   mechanisms in addition to those deployed by the SP, in order to 
   secure specific applications or traffic at a granularity finer than a 
   site-to-site basis.  
     
   A security solution deployed by a customer must not hide information 
   necessary for the SP to support QoS features. For example, 
   applications must send RSVP messages in support of Intserv either in 
   the clear or encrypted using a key negotiated with the SP. Another 
   case is where applications using an IPsec tunnel must copy the DSCP 
   from the encrypted IP header to the header of the tunnel's IP header.  
    
   Security services shall apply to: 
    o either, all VPN traffic exchanged between different sites ; 
    o or, a subset of the VPN traffic between sites as identified by a 
    combination of the destination IP address, the Security Profile 
    Index (SPI) and the IPsec AH or ESP identifier. 
    
4.10 Migration Impact 
   Often, customers are migrating from an already deployed private 
   network toward one or more Provider Provisioned VPN solutions. A 
   typical private network scenario is CE routers connected via real or 
   virtual circuits. Ideally, minimal incremental cost should result 
   during the migration period. Furthermore, if necessary, any 
   disruption of service should also be minimized. 
    
   A range of scenarios of customer migration must be supported. Full  
   migration of all sites must be supported. Support for cases of 
   partial migration is highly desirable [Y.1311.1], that is, legacy 
   private network sites that belong to the PPVPN service should still 
   have L3 reachability to the sites that migrate to the PPVPN service. 
    
4.11 Network Access 
   Every L3 packet exchanged between the customer and the SP over the 
   access connection must appear as it would on a private network 
   providing an equivalent service to that offered by the PPVPN. 
    
4.11.1 Physical/Link Layer Technology  
   PPVPNs should a broad range of physical and link layer access 
   technologies, such as PSTN, ISDN, xDSL, cable modem, leased line, 
   Ethernet, Ethernet VLAN, ATM, Frame Relay, Wireless local loop, 
   mobile radio access, etc. The capacity and QoS achievable may be 
   dependent on the specific access technology in use. 
    

 
Carugi et al    Informational - Expires September 2002              20                Service requirements for Layer 3 PPVPNs     March, 2002 
 
 
4.11.2 Temporary Access 
   The VPN service offering should allow both permanent and temporary 
   access to one or more PPVPNs for authenticated users across a broad 
   range of access technologies. Support for remote or temporary VPN 
   access should include ISDN, PSTN dial-in, xDSL or access via another 
   SP network. The customer should be able to choose from alternatives 
   for authentication of temporary access users. Choices for access 
   authentication are: SP-provided, third-party, or customer-provided 
   authentication servers.   
    
   A significant number of VPN users are not permanently attached to one 
   VPN site. In order to limit access to a VPN to only authorized users, 
   it is first necessary to authenticate them. Authentication shall 
   apply as configured by the customer agent and/or SP where a specific 
   user may be part of one or more VPNs. The authentication function 
   should be used to automatically invoke all actions necessary VPN 
   communication.  
    
   A user should be able to access a PPVPN via a network having generic 
   Internet access. 
    
   Mobile users may move within a PPVPN site. Mobile users may also 
   temporarily connect to another PPVPN site within the same VPN. 
   Authentication should be provided for both of these cases.  
    
4.11.3 Sharing of the Access Network 
   In a PE-based PPVPN, if the site shares the access network with other 
   customer traffic, then data security in the access network is the 
   responsibility of the PPVPN customer. 
 
4.11.4 Access Connectivity 
   Various types of physical connectivity scenarios must be supported, 
   such as multi-homed sites, backdoor links between customer sites, 
   devices homed to two or more SP networks. PPVPN solutions should 
   support at least the types of physical or link-layer connectivity 
   arrangements shown in Figure 4.1. Support for other physical 
   connectivity scenarios with arbitrary topology is desirable.  
    
   Access arrangements with multiple physical or logical paths from a CE 
   to other CEs and PEs must support redundancy, and should support load 
   balancing. Resiliency uses redundancy to provide connectivity between 
   a CE site and other CE sites, and optionally, other services. Load 
   balancing provides a means to perform traffic engineering such that 
   capacity on redundant links is used to achieve improved performance 
   during periods when the redundant component(s) are available. 
    
   For multi-homing to a single SP, load balancing capability should be 
   supported by the PE across the CE to PE links. For example, in case 
   (a), load balancing should be provided by the two PEs over the two 
   links connecting to the single CE. In case (c), load balancing should 
   be provided by the two PEs over the two links connecting to the two 
   CEs.

   In addition, the load balancing parameters (e.g., the ratio of 
   traffic on the multiple load-balanced links, or the preferred link) 
   should be provisionable based on customer's requirements. The load 
   balancing capability may also be used to achieve resiliency in the 
   event of access connectivity failures. For example, in cases (b) a CE 
   may connect to two different SPs via diverse access networks. 
   Resiliency may be further enhanced as shown in case (d), where CE's 
   connected via a "back door" connection connect to different SPs.   
   Furthermore, arbitrary combinations of the above methods, with a few 
   examples shown in cases (e) and (f) should be supportable by any 
   PPVPN approach. 
    
   For multi-homing to multiple SPs, load balancing capability may also 
   be supported by the PEs in the different SPs (clearly, this is a more 
   complex type of load balancing to realize, and requires policy and 
   service agreements between the SPs to interoperate). 
    
4.12 Service Access  
   Customers may also require access to other services, as described in 
   this section. 
    
4.12.1 Internet Access 
   Customers should be able to have L3 PPVPN and Internet access across 
   the same access network for one or more of the customer's sites.  
    
   Customers should be able to direct Internet traffic from the set of 
   sites in the PPVPN to one or more customer sites that have firewalls, 
   other security-oriented devices, and/or NAT that process all traffic 
   between the Internet and the customer's VPN.  
    
   L3 PPVPN Customers should be able to receive traffic from the 
   Internet addressed to a publicly accessible resource that is not part 
   of the VPN, such as an enterprise's public web server.  
    
   As stated in section 4.3, network address translation (NAT) or 
   similar mechanism must be provided either by the customer or the SP 
   in order to be able to interchange traffic between devices assigned 
   non-unique or private IP addresses and devices that have unique IP 
   addresses. 
    
4.12.2 Hosting, Application Service Provider 
   A customer should be able to access hosting, other application 
   services, or other Application Service Providers (ASP) over a L3 
   PPVPN service. 
    
4.12.3 Other Services  
   In conjunction with a VPN service, a customer may also wish to have 
   access to other services, such as: DNS, FTP, HTTP, NNTP, SMTP, LDAP, 
   VoIP, NAT, LDAP, Videoconferencing, Application sharing, E-business, 
   Streaming, E-commerce, Directory, Firewall, etc.

4.13 Hybrid VPN Service Scenarios 
   Intranet or extranet customers have a number of reasons for wanting 
   hybrid networks that involve more than one VPN solution type. These 
   include migration, mergers, extranet customers with different VPN 
   types, the need for different capabilities between different sets of 
   sites, temporary access, different availability of VPN solutions as 
   provided by different service providers.  
    
   The framework and solution approaches should include provisions for 
   interworking, interconnection, and/or reachability between different 
   PPVPN solutions in such a way that does not overly complicate 
   provisioning, management, scalability, or performance. 
    
5 Service Provider Network Requirements 
   This section describes requirements from a service provider 
   perspective. 
    
5.1 Scalability 
   This section contains projections regarding PPVPN sizing projections 
   and scalability requirements and metrics specific to particular 
   solutions. 
    
5.1.1  Service Provider Capacity Sizing Projections 
   This section captures projections for scaling requirements over the 
   next several years in terms of number of VPNs, number of interfaces 
   per VPN, number of routes per VPN, and the rate of VPN configuration 
   changes. These numbers provide a baseline against which the 
   scalability of specific approaches can be assessed. These values were 
   derived from ITU-T [Y.1311.1] and inputs from service providers. 
    
   A PPVPN solution should be scalable to support a very large number of 
   VPNs per Service Provider network. The estimate is that a large 
   service provider will require support for on the order of 10,000 VPNs 
   within four years. 
    
   A PPVPN solution should be scalable to support of a wide range of 
   number of site interfaces per VPN, depending on the size and/or 
   structure of the customer organization. The number of site interfaces 
   should range from a few site interfaces to over 50,000 site 
   interfaces per VPN. 
     
   A PPVPN solution should be scalable to support of a wide range of 
   number of routes per VPN. The number of routes per VPN may range from 
   just a few to the number of routes exchanged between ISPs using BGP 
   (in 2001, on the order of 100,000). Typically, the number of routes 
   per VPN is O(2N), where N is the number of site interfaces. 
    
   A PPVPN solution should support high values of the frequency of 
   configuration setup and change, e.g. for real-time provisioning of an 
   on-demand videoconferencing VPN. As a guideline, an estimate on the 
   VPN frequency of change (e.g., addition/removal of sites per VPN per 

 
Carugi et al    Informational - Expires September 2002              24                Service requirements for Layer 3 PPVPNs     March, 2002 
 
 
   time unit) could be as large as 1 million per year across all service 
   providers within the next four years.   
    
   Approaches should articulate scaling and performance limits for more 
   complex deployment scenarios, such as inter-AS(S) VPNs and carriers' 
   carrier. Approaches should also describe other dimensions of 
   interest, such as capacity requirements or limits, number of 
   interworking instances supported as well as any scalability 
   implications on management systems. 
    
5.1.2  Solution-Specific Metrics 
   Each PPVPN solution shall document its scalability characteristics in 
   quantitative terms. Two examples are provided below as an 
   illustration. 
    
   The following example applies to the number of tunnels necessary in 
   various devices in the network. In a PE-based VPN, edge-to-edge 
   tunnels (PE-to-PE) need to be established, while in a CE-based VPN, 
   end-to-end tunnels between pairs of CE's are necessary. Therefore, 
   fewer tunnels need to be maintained in a PE-based solution and 
   scalability could be improved over that of CE-based VPNs e.g. ATM, 
   FR, IPsec). The other tradeoff is that in a PE-based solution, the CE 
   is simple at the expense of complex PE devices, while on the other 
   hand, in a CE-based solution, the PE devices remain simple while the 
   CE devices are more complex. 
    
   A scalable PE-based solution should quantify the amount of state that 
   a PE and P router must support. This should be stated in terms of of 
   the total number of VPNs and site interfaces supported by the service 
   provider. Ideally, all VPN-specific state should be contained in the 
   PE router, since routing and/or configuration information depends 
   only on the VPNs whose site(s) are connected to that PE. However, 
   this should be balanced against the requirements of specific 
   services, such as multicast, which may require per VPN state in the P 
   router.  
    
5.2 Addressing  
   As described in section 3.4, SPs require support for public and 
   private IP addresses, IPv4 and IPv6, for both unicast and multicast. 
   In order to support this range of addressing schemes, SPs require the 
   following support from PPVPN solutions. 
    
   A L3 PPVPN solution must be able to assign blocks of addresses form 
   its own public IP address space to PPVPN customer sites in such a way 
   that advertisement of routes to other SPs and other sites aggregates 
   efficiently. 
    
   A PPVPN solution must be able to use address assignments made by a 
   customer. These customer assigned addresses may be public, or 
   private. 
    

 
Carugi et al    Informational - Expires September 2002              25                Service requirements for Layer 3 PPVPNs     March, 2002 
 
 
   In the case where private IP addresses are used, a PPVPN solution 
   must provide a means for an SP to translate such addresses to public 
   IP addresses for communication with other VPNs using overlapping 
   addresses, or the Internet. 
    
5.3 Identifiers 
   A number of identifiers may be necessary for SP use in management, 
   control, and routing protocols. Requirements for at least the 
   following identifiers are known. 
    
   An SP domain must be uniquely identified at least within the set of 
   all interconnected SP networkswhen supporting a VPN that spans 
   multiple SPs. Ideally, this identifier should be globally unique 
   (e.g., an AS number).   
    
   A identifier for each VPN should be unique, at least within each SP's 
   network. Ideally, the VPN identifier should be globally unique to 
   support the case where a VPN spans multiple SPs (e.g., [RFC 2685]). 
    
   A CE device should have a unique identifier, at least within each 
   SP's network. 
    
   A PE device should have a unique identifier, at least within each 
   SP's network. 
    
   The identifier of a device interconnecting SP networks must be unique 
   within the set of aforementioned networks. 
    
   Each site interface should have a unique identifier, at least within 
   each PE router supporting such an interface. 
    
   Each tunnel should have a unique identifier, at least within each 
   router supporting the tunnel. 
    
5.4 Learning VPN Related Information 
   Configuration of CE and PE devices is a significant task for a 
   service provider. Solutions should strive to contain methods that 
   that dynamically allows VPN information to be learned (or discovered) 
   by the PE and/or CE to reduce configuration complexity. The following 
   specific requirements apply to intra and inter-provider VPNs [VPN 
   DISC]. 
    
   Every device involved in a VPN shall be able to identify and 
   authenticate itself to other devices in the VPN. After learning the 
   VPN membership, the devices should be able to securely exchange 
   configuration information. The VPN information must include at least 
   the IP address of the PE and may extensible to provide additional 
   information. 
    
   Each device in a VPN should be able to determine which other devices 
   belong to the same VPN.  Such a membership discovery scheme must 
   prevent unauthorized access and allows authentication of the source.    
 
Carugi et al    Informational - Expires September 2002              26                Service requirements for Layer 3 PPVPNs     March, 2002 
 
 
    
   Distribution of VPN information should be limited to those PEs 
   involved in that VPN. 
    
   The mechanism should respond to VPN membership changes in a timely 
   manner. A "timely manner" is no longer than the provisioning 
   timeframe, and may be as short as the timeframe required for 
   "rerouting." 
    
   Dynamically creating, changing, and managing multiple VPN assignments 
   to sites and/or customers is another aspect of membership that must 
   be addressed in a L3 PPVPN solution.   
    
5.5 SLA and SLS Support 
   Typically, a Service Provider offering a PPVPN service commits to 
   specific Service Level Specifications (SLS) as part of a contract 
   with the customer, as described in section 3.7. Such a Service Level 
   Agreement (SLA) drives the following specific SP requirements for 
   measuring Specific Service Level Specifications (SLS) for quality, 
   availability, response time, and configuration intervals. 
    
5.6 Quality of Service (QoS) and Traffic Engineering 
   A significant aspect of a PPVPN is support for QoS. Since an SP has 
   control over the provisioning of resources and configuration of 
   parameters in at least the PE and P devices, and in some cases, the 
   CE device as well, the onus is on the service provider to provide 
   either managed QoS access service, or edge-to-edge QoS service, as 
   defined in section 3.6.2.  
    
   Each PPVPN approach must describe the traffic engineering techniques 
   available for a service provider to meet the QoS objectives. These 
   descriptions of traffic engineering techniques should quantify 
   scalability and achievable efficiency. Traffic engineering support 
   may be on an aggregate or per-VPN basis. 
    
   QoS policies must not be impacted by security mechanisms. For 
   example, Diffserv policies must not be impacted by the use of IPSec 
   tunnels, using the mechanisms explained in RFC 2983.  
    
   As stated in RFC 2475, a mapping function from customer provided 
   DifServ marking to marking used in a SP network should be provided 
   for L3 PPVPN services.  
    
   In the case where a customer requires DSCP transparency, as described 
   in section 4.5.2, a L3 PPVPN service must deliver the same value of 
   DSCP field in the IP header received from the customer to the egress 
   demarcation of the destination.  
    
5.7 Routing 
   The distribution of reachability and routing policy should be 
   constrained to the sites that are members of the VPN. Optionally, the 
   exchange of such information may be secured, for example, using MD5 
 
Carugi et al    Informational - Expires September 2002              27                Service requirements for Layer 3 PPVPNs     March, 2002 
 
 
   authentication. Additional parameters to isolate routing usage of 
   resources should be supported, such as BGP route dampening and a 
   maximum number of routes accepted per VFI [MPLS SEC]. 
    
   When VPN customers use overlapping, non-unique IP addresses, the 
   solution must define a means to distinguish between such overlapping 
   addresses on a per-VPN basis.   
    
   Furthermore, the solution should provide an option that either 
   allows, or prevents advertisement of VPN routes to the Internet. 
    
   Ideally, the choice of a SP's IGP should not depend on the routing 
   protocol(s) used between PE and CE routers in a PE-based VPN. 
   Furthermore, it is desirable that an SP should have a choice with 
   regards to the IGP routing protocol. 
    
   The additional routing burden that a Service Provider must         
   carry should be articulated in each specific L3 PPVPN solution. 
    
5.8 Isolation of Traffic and Routing 
   The internal structure of a PPVPN network should not be visible to 
   outside networks (i.e., the Internet or any connected VPN).  
    
   From a high level SP perspective, a PE-based PPVPN must isolate the 
   exchange of traffic and routing information to only those sites that 
   are authenticated and authorized members of a VPN. In a CE-based VPN, 
   the tunnels that connect the sites effectively meet this isolation 
   requirement if both traffic and routing information flow over the 
   tunnels. 
    
   A PPVPN solution should provide a means for meeting PPVPN QoS SLA 
   requirements that isolates VPN traffic from the affects of traffic 
   offered by non-VPN customers. Also, PPVPN solutions should provide a 
   means to isolate the effects that traffic congestion produced by 
   sites as part of one VPN can have on another VPN. 
    
   The following example illustrates this requirement for a L3 PE-based 
   VPN. It assumes that a network contains three PE devices (1, 2, and 
   3) that supports three VPNs (A, B and C). Assume also that each PE 
   dedicates one access port to a site for each of the three VPNs. 
    
   Each PE must maintain at most three L3 forwarding tables, one for 
   each of the three VPNs. Note that if a PE does not support a 
   particular VPN, it need not maintain a table for that VPN. A PE may 
   also support a fourth table in a L3 VPN service for access to the 
   Internet. A PE must forward a datagram received from a CE according 
   to the forwarding table for that VPN, as defined in section 2.6. If 
   the switching or forwarding table does not contain a relevant entry, 
   the PE should execute one of the following procedures, depending upon 
   its configuration: 
    
     1) discard the datagram 
 
Carugi et al    Informational - Expires September 2002              28                Service requirements for Layer 3 PPVPNs     March, 2002 
 
 
     2) attempt to forward the datagram based upon information obtained 
   from the general forwarding table for a L3 VPN service 
    
   The PE MUST NOT forward the datagram based upon information obtained 
   from any switching or forwarding table related to any other VPN. 
    
   PE devices in a L3 VPN must isolate VPNs from one another with 
   respect to the distribution of routing information. For example, in 
   the network described above, assume that PE 1 is connected directly 
   to CE A1, which is a member of VPN A. PE 1 may distribute routing 
   information concerning CE A1 to PE's 2 and 3. PEs 2 and 3 may install 
   this information in the forwarding table that supports VPN A, but not 
   in any other VPN forwarding tables. 
    
5.9 Security 
   This section contains requirements related to securing customer 
   flows, providing authentication services for temporary, remote or 
   mobile users, and the need to protect service provider resources 
   involved in supporting a PPVPN. 
    
5.9.1  Support for Securing Customer Flows 
   In order to meet the general requirement for providing a range of 
   security options to a customer, each PPVPN solution must clearly 
   spell out the configuration options that can work together and how 
   the can do so. 
    
   When a VPN solution operates over a part of the Internet it should 
   support a configurable option to support one or more of the following 
   standard IPsec methods for securing a flow for a specified subset of 
   a customer's VPN traffic: 
     o confidentiality, so that only authorized devices can decrypt it, 
     o integrity, to ensure that the data has not been altered, 
     o authentication, to ensure that the sender is indeed who it claims 
     to be, 
     o replay attack prevention, to prevent a "man in the middle" 
     attack. 
    
   The above functions should be capable of being applied to "data 
   traffic" of the customer, which includes the traffic exchanged 
   between sites, between temporary users and sites and even between 
   temporary users. It should also be possible to apply these functions 
   to "control traffic", such as routing protocol exchanges, that are 
   not necessarily perceived by the customer but nevertheless essential 
   to maintain his or her VPN. Note that it may be necessary to extend 
   the IPsec protocol to support exchange of control traffic over an 
   IPsec tunnel [IPSEC-PPVPN].  
    
   Furthermore, such security methods must be configurable between 
   different end points, such as CE-CE, PE-PE, and CE-PE. It is also 
   desirable to configure security on a per-route or per-VPN basis [VPN 
   SEC]. 
    
 
Carugi et al    Informational - Expires September 2002              29                Service requirements for Layer 3 PPVPNs     March, 2002 
 
 
   A VPN solution may support one or more encryption schemes, including 
   DES, 3DES. Encryption, decryption, and key management should be 
   included in profiles as part of the security management system.  
    
5.9.2  Authentication Services 
   A service provider must provide authentication services in support of 
   temporary user access requirements, as described in section 4.11.2. 
    
   Furthermore, traffic exchanged within the scope of VPN may involve 
   several categories of equipment that must cooperate together to 
   provide the service [Y.1311.1]. These network elements can be CE, PE, 
   firewalls, backbone routers, servers, management stations, etc. These 
   network elements learn about each others identity, either via manual 
   configuration or via discovery protocols, as described in section 
   5.4. When network elements must cooperate, it is necessary to 
   authenticate peers before providing the requested service. This 
   authentication function may also be used to control access to network 
   resources. 
    
   The peer identification and authentication function described above 
   applies only to network elements participating in the VPN. Examples 
   include: 
   - traffic between a CE and a PE, 
   - traffic between CEs belonging to the same VPN, 
   - CE or PE routers dealing with route announcements for a VPN, 
   - policy decision point [RFC 3198] and a network element, 
   - management station and an SNMP agent. 
    
   Each PPVPN solution should describe for a peer authentication 
   function: where it is necessary, how it shall be implemented, how 
   secure it must be, and the way to deploy and maintain identification 
   and authentication information necessary to operate the service.  
    
5.9.3  Resource Protection 
   Recall from the definitions in section 2.3, that a site can be part 
   of an intranet with sites from the only same organization, part of an 
   extranet involving sites from other organizations, have access to the 
   Internet, or any combination of these scopes of communication. Within 
   these contexts, a site might be subject to various attacks coming 
   from different sources. Potential sources of attack include:  
   - users connected to the supporting public IP backbone,  
   - users from the Internet,  
   - users from temporary sites belonging to the intranet and/or 
   extranet VPN that the site is part of. 
    
   Security threats and risks that a site may encounter include the 
   following: 
     - denial of service, for example: mail spamming, access connection 
     congestion, TCP SYN attacks, ping attacks, etc. 
     - intrusion attempts, which may eventually lead to denial of 
     service (e.g. a Trojan horse attack). 
    
 
Carugi et al    Informational - Expires September 2002              30                Service requirements for Layer 3 PPVPNs     March, 2002 
 
 
   In order to address the above threats and risks, a SP should be able 
   to deploy functions that control access to the site. This includes 
   filtering functions provided by firewall, and monitoring, alerting 
   and eventually logging all suspicious activities in order to detect 
   potential attacks. Another way to prevent such an attack is to make 
   sure that machines are not reachable via address hiding [MPLS SEC]. 
 
   The devices in the PPVPN network must provide some means of reporting 
   intrusion attempts to the service provider. 
    
5.10 Inter-AS (SP)VPNs  
   The scenario for VPNs spanning multiple Autonomous Systems (AS)or 
   Service Providers (SP) is a complex one that requires 
   standardization.  The scenarios where multiple AS's are involved is 
   the most general case, and is therefore the one described here.  The 
   scenarios of concern are the CE-based and PE-based L3 VPNs defined in 
   section 2.  
    
   In each scenario, all applicable SP requirements, such as traffic and 
   routing isolation, SLA's, management, security, provisioning, etc. 
   must be preserved across adjacent AS's. The solution must describe 
   the inter-SP network interface, encapsulation method(s), routing 
   protocol(s), and all applicable parameters [VPN IW]. 
    
   An essential pre-condition for an inter-AS VPN is an agreement 
   between the service providers involved that spells out at least 
   trust, economic, and management responsibilities.   
    
   The overall scalability of the VPN service must allow the PPVPN 
   service to be offered across potentially hundreds of SPs, with the 
   overall scaling parameters per SP given in section 5.1. 
    
5.10.1 Routing Protocols 
   If the link between AS's or SP's is not trusted, routing protocols 
   running between those AS's or SP's must support some form of 
   authentication. For example, the TCP option for carrying an MD5 
   digest may be used to enhance security for BGP [RFC2385].  
    
   AS's/SP's should specify the AS-path and other attributes in a 
   standard routing protocol (e.g., BGP) to control the path taken by 
   PPVPN traffic. 
    
5.10.2 Management 
   The general requirements for managing a single AS apply to a 
   concatenation of AS's. A minimum subset of such capabilities is the 
   following: 
     - Diagnostic tools (e.g., ping, traceroute) 
     - Secured access to one AS management system by another 
     - Configuration request and status query tools 
     - Fault notification and trouble tracking tools 
    

 
Carugi et al    Informational - Expires September 2002              31                Service requirements for Layer 3 PPVPNs     March, 2002 
 
 
5.10.3 Bandwidth and Qos Brokering 
   When a VPN spans multiple AS's, there is a need for a brokering 
   mechanism that requests certain SLA parameters, such as bandwidth and 
   QoS, from the other domains and/or networks involved in transferring 
   traffic to various sites. The essential requirement is that a 
   solution must be able to determine whether a set of AS's can 
   establish and guarantee uniform QoS in support of a PPVPN. 
    
   The brokering mechanism can be a manual one, for example, where one 
   provider requests from another provider a specific set of QoS 
   parameters for traffic going to and from a specific set of sites. The 
   mechanism could also be an automated one where a device dynamically 
   requests and receives certain SLA/QoS parameters. For instance, in 
   the case of a L3 PPVPN, a PE may negotiate the label for different 
   traffic classes to reach a PE residing in a neighboring AS. Or, it 
   might be a combination of both.  
 
   In the case of an automated function, which is desirable, the 
   functionality supported should dynamically request and reserve 
   certain QoS parameters such as bandwidth and priority, and then to 
   classify, mark and handle the packets as agreed in the negotiation. 
   Observe that as traffic might traverse multiple AS's, the brokering 
   method should also allow this.  
 
   It is not desirable to perform brokering on a per VPN basis since 
   such an approach would not scale. A solution must provide some means 
   of aggregating QoS and bandwidth brokering requests between AS's. One 
   method could be for SP's to make an agreement specifying the maximum 
   amount of bandwidth for specific QoS parameters for all VPN customers 
   using the SP network. Alternatively, such aggregation might be on a 
   per hierarchical tunnnel basis between PE routers in different AS's 
   supporting a L3 PPVPN service.  
    
5.10.4 Security Considerations 
   If a tunnel traverses multiple SP networks and it passes through an 
   unsecure SP, POP, NAP, or IX, then security mechanisms must be 
   employed. 
    
5.11 PPVPN Wholesale 
   The architecture must support the possibility of one service provider 
   offering VPN service to another service provider.  Another example is 
   when one service provider sells PPVPN service at wholesale to another 
   service provider, who then resells that VPN service to his or her 
   customers.  
    
   The wholesaler's VPN must be transparent to the addressing and 
   routing used by the reseller. 
    
   Support for additional levels of hierarchy, for example three levels 
   where a reseller can again resell the VPN service to yet another VPN 
   provider, should be provided. This is called a hierarchical VPN 
   scenario. 
 
Carugi et al    Informational - Expires September 2002              32                Service requirements for Layer 3 PPVPNs     March, 2002 
 
 
    
   The Carrier's carrier scenario is the name used in this document for 
   this category of PPVPN wholesale. Various Carrier's Carrier scenarios 
   should be supported, such as: 
  -     the customer Carriers do not operate PPVPN services for their 
     clients;  
  -     the customer Carriers operate PPVPN services for their clients, 
     but these services are not linked with the PPVPN service offered  
     by the Carriers' Carrier;  
  -     the customer Carriers operate PPVPN services for their clients and 
     these services are linked with the PPVPN service offered by the 
     Carriers' Carrier ("Hierarchical VPNs" scenario) 
    
5.12 Tunneling Requirements 
   Connectivity between CE sites or PE devices in the backbone should be 
   able to use a range of tunneling technologies, such as L2TP, IPSEC, 
   GRE, MPLS, IP-in-IP, etc. 
    
   To set up tunnels between PE routers, every PE router must support 
   static configuration for tunneling and may support a tunnel setup 
   protocol. If employed, a tunnel establishment protocol must convey 
   information regarding: 
     - Relevant identifiers  
     - QoS/SLA 
     - Restoration 
     - Multiplexing 
    
   There must be a means to monitor the following aspects of tunnels: 
      - Statistics, such as amount of time spent in the up and down 
      state 
     - Count of transitions between the up and down state 
     - Events, such as transitions between the up and down states 
    
   The tunneling technology used by the VPN Service Provider and its 
   associated mechanisms for tunnel establishment, multiplexing, and 
   maintenance must meet the requirements on scaling, isolation, 
   security, QoS, manageability, etc. 
    
5.13 Support for Access and Backbone Technologies 
   This section describes requirements for aspects of access and 
   backbone network technologies from a service provider point of view. 
    
   Some SPs may desire that a single network infrastructure should 
   suffice for all services, public IP, VPNs, traffic engineering, and 
   differentiated services [L2 VPN]. 
    
5.13.1 Dedicated Access Networks 
   Ideally, the PPVPN service should be independent of physical, link 
   layer or even network technology of the access network. However, the 
   characteristics of access networks must be accounted for when 
   specifying the QoS aspects of SLAs for VPN service offerings. 
    
 
Carugi et al    Informational - Expires September 2002              33                Service requirements for Layer 3 PPVPNs     March, 2002 
 
 
5.13.2 On-Demand Access Networks  
   Service providers should be able to support temporary user access, as 
   described in section 4.11.2 using dedicated or dial-in access network 
   technology.   
    
   PPVPN solutions must support the case where a VPN user directly 
   accesses the VPN service through an access network connected to the 
   service provider. They must also describe how they can support the 
   case where one or more other service provider networks are used as 
   access to the service provider supporting the PPVPN service.  
    
   Ideally, all information necessary to identify and authenticate users 
   for an intranet should be stored and maintained by the customer. In 
   an extranet, one customer should be able to maintain the 
   authentication server, or the customers involved in the extranet may 
   choose to outsource the function to a service provider. 
    
   Identification and authentication information could be made available 
   to the service provider for controlling access, or the service 
   provider may query a customer maintained server. Furthermore, one SP 
   may act as access for the SP providing the VPN service. In the case 
   where the access SP performs identification and authentication on 
   behalf of the VPN SP, an agreement must be reached on a common 
   specification. 
    
   Support for at least the following authentication protocols is 
   required: PAP, CHAP and EAP, since they are currently used in a wide 
   range of equipment and services. 
    
5.13.3 Backbone Networks 
   Ideally, the backbone interconnecting SP PE and P devices should be 
   independent of physical and link layer technology. Nevertheless, the 
   characteristics of backbone technology must be taken into account 
   when specifying the QoS aspects of SLAs for VPN service offerings. 
    
5.14 Protection, Restoration 
   When primary and secondary access connections are available, a PPVPN 
   solution must provide restoration of access connectivity whenever the 
   primary access link from a CE site to a PE fails. This restoration 
   capability should be as automatic as possible, that is, the traffic 
   should be directed over the secondary link soon after failure of the 
   primary access link is detected. Furthermore, reversion to the 
   primary link should be dynamic, if configured to do so [VPN-NEEDS]. 
    
   As mentioned in Section 4.11.4 above, in the case of multi-homing, 
   the load balancing capability may be used to achieve a degree of 
   redundancy in the network. In the case of failure of one or more (but 
   not all) of the multi-homed links, the load balancing parameters may 
   be dynamically adjusted to rapidly redirect the traffic from the 
   failed link(s) to the surviving links. Once the failed link(s) is 
   (are) restored, the original provisioned load balancing ratio should 
   be restored to its value prior to the failure. 
 
Carugi et al    Informational - Expires September 2002              34                Service requirements for Layer 3 PPVPNs     March, 2002 
 
 
    
   The Service provider should be able to deploy protection and 
   restoration mechanisms within the service provider's backbone 
   infrastructure to increase reliability and fault tolerance of the VPN 
   service offering. These techniques should be scalable, and therefore 
   should strive to not perform such function in the backbone on a per-
   VPN basis.  
    
   Appropriate measurements and alarms that indicate how well network 
   protection and restoration mechanisms are performing must be 
   supported.   
    
5.15 Interoperability 
   Service providers are interested in interoperability in at least the 
   following scenarios: 
     - To facilitate use of PE and managed CE devices within a single SP 
     network 
     - To implement PPVPN services across two or more interconnected SP 
     networks 
     - To achieve interworking or interconnection between customer sites 
     using different PPVPN approaches or different implementations of 
     the same approach  
 
   Each approach must describe whether any of the above objectives can 
   be met. If an objective can be met, the approach must describe how 
   such interoperability could be achieved. In particular, the approach 
   must describe the inter-solution network interface, encapsulation 
   method(s), routing protocol(s), security, isolation, management, and 
   all other applicable aspects of the overall VPN solution provided 
   [VPN IW].  
 
5.16 Migration Support 
   Service providers must have a graceful means to migrate a customer 
   with minimal service disruption on a site-by-site basis to a PPVPN 
   approach.  
 
   If PPVPN approaches can interwork or interconnect, then service 
   providers must have a graceful means to migrate a customer with 
   minimal service disruption on a site-by-site basis whenever changing 
   interworking or interconnection. 
 
6 Service Provider Management Requirements 
   A service provider must have a means to view the topology, 
   operational state, order status, and other parameters associated with 
   each customer's VPN. Furthermore, the service provider must have a 
   means to view the underlying logical and physical topology, 
   operational state, provisioning status, and other parameters 
   associated with the equipment providing the VPN service(s) to its 
   customers. 
    
   Currently, proprietary methods are often used to manage VPNs. The 
   additional expense associated with operators having to use multiple 
 
Carugi et al    Informational - Expires September 2002              35                Service requirements for Layer 3 PPVPNs     March, 2002 
 
 
   proprietary management methods (e.g., command line interface (CLI) 
   languages) to access such systems is undesirable. Therefore, devices 
   should provide standards-based interfaces wherever feasible. 
    
   The remainder of this section presents detailed service provider 
   management requirements for a Network Management System (NMS) in the 
   traditional fault, configuration, accounting, performance, and 
   security (FCAPS) management categories. Much of this text was adapted 
   from ITU-T Y.1311.1. 
    
6.1 Fault management  
   Support for fault management includes: 
   - indication of customers impacted by failure, 
   - fault detection (incidents reports, alarms, failure visualization), 
   - fault localization (analysis of alarms reports, diagnostics), 
   - incident recording or logs, creation and follow through of trouble 
   tickets), 
   - corrective actions (traffic, routing, resource allocation). 
    
   Since PE-based VPNs rely on a common network infrastructure, the 
   network management system must provide a means to inform the provider 
   on the VPN customers impacted by a failure in the infrastructure. The 
   NMS should provide pointers to the related customer configuration 
   information to aid in fault isolation and the determination of 
   corrective action. 
    
   It is desirable to detect faults caused by configuration errors, 
   because these may cause VPN service to fail, or not meet other 
   requirements (e.g., traffic and routing isolation). Detection of such 
   errors is inherently difficult because the problem involves more than 
   one node and may reach across a global perspective. One approach 
   could be a protocol that systematically checks that all constraints 
   and consistency checks hold among tunnel configuration parameters at 
   the various end points.  
    
   A capability to verify L3 reachability within a VPN must be provided 
   for diagnostic purposes.   
    
   A capability to verify the parameter configuration of a device 
   supporting a PPVPN must be provided for diagnostic purposes.   
    
6.2 Configuration Management 
   Overall, The NMS must support configuration necessary to realize 
   desired L3 reachability of a PPVPN. Toward this end, an NMS must 
   provide configuration management to provision at least the following 
   PPVPN components: PE,CE, hierarchical tunnels, access connections, 
   routing, and QoS, as detailed in this section. If shared access to 
   the Internet is provided, then this option must also be configurable. 
    
   Since VPN configuration and topology are highly dependent upon a 
   customer's organization, provisioning systems must address a broad 
   range of customer specific requirements. The NMS must ensure that 
 
Carugi et al    Informational - Expires September 2002              36                Service requirements for Layer 3 PPVPNs     March, 2002 
 
 
   these devices and protocols are provisioned consistently and 
   correctly. 
    
   Provisioning for adding or removing sites should be as localized and 
   automated as possible. 
    
   Configuration management for VPNs, according to service templates 
   defined by the provider must be supported. A service template 
   contains fields which, when instantiated, yield a definite service 
   requirement or policy. For example, a template for an IPSec tunnel 
   would contain fields such as tunnel end points, authentication modes, 
   encryption and authentication algorithms, preshared keys if any, and 
   traffic filters. A BGP/MPLS service template would contain fields 
   such as the sites that need to form a VPN. An SLA template would 
   contain fields such as delay, jitter, throughput and packet loss 
   thresholds as well as end points over which the SLA has to be 
   satisfied. In general, a customer's service order can be regarded as 
   a set of instantiated service templates. This set can, in turn, be  
   regarded as the logical or service architecture of the customer's 
   VPN. 
    
   Service templates can also be used by the provider to define the 
   service architecture of the provider's own network. For example, OSPF 
   templates could contain fields such as the subnets that form a 
   particular area, the area identifier and the area type. BGP service 
   template could contain fields which when instantiated would yield a 
   BGP policy such as for expressing a preference about an exit router 
   for a particular destination. 
    
   The set of service templates should be comprehensive in that they can 
   capture all service orders in some meaningful sense. 
    
   The provider should provide means for translating instantiated 
   service templates into device configurations so that associated 
   services can be provisioned.  
    
   Finally, the approach should provide means for checking if a service 
   order is correctly provisioned. This would represent one method of 
   diagnosing configuration errors. Configuration errors can arise due 
   to a variety of reasons: manual configuration, intruder attacks, 
   conflicting service requirements. 
    
6.2.1  Configuration Management for PE-Based VPNs 
   Requirements for configuration management unique to a PE-based VPN 
   are as follows. 
 
   o The NMS must support configuration of at least the following 
   aspects of a L3 PE routers: intranet and extranet membership, CE 
   routing protocol for each access connection, routing metrics, 
   tunnels, etc.  
    

 
Carugi et al    Informational - Expires September 2002              37                Service requirements for Layer 3 PPVPNs     March, 2002 
 
 
   o The NMS should use identifiers for SPs, PPVPNs, PEs, CEs, 
   hierarchical tunnels and access connections as described in section 
   5.3. 
    
   o Tunnels must be configured between PE and P devices.  This requires 
   coordination of identifiers of tunnels, hierarchical tunnels, VPNs, 
   and any associated service information, for example, a QoS/SLA 
   service. 
    
   o Routing protocols running between PE routers and CE devices must be 
   configured per VPN.   
    
   O For multicast service, multicast routing protocols must also be 
   configurable. 
    
   o Routing protocols running between PE routers and between PE and P 
   routers must also be configured.   
    
   o The configuration of a PE-based PPVPN must be coordinated with the 
   configuration of the underlying infrastructure, including Layer 1 and 
   2 networks interconnecting components of a PPVPN. 
    
6.2.2  Configuration management for CE-based VPN 
   Requirements for configuration management unique to a CE-based VPN 
   are as follows. 
    
   o Tunnels must be configured between CE devices.  This requires 
   coordination of identifiers of tunnels, VPNs, and any associated 
   service information, for example, a QoS/SLA service. 
    
   o Routing protocols running between PE routers and CE devices must be 
   configured.  For multicast service, multicast routing protocols must 
   also be configurable. 
    
6.2.3  Provisioning Routing  
   A means for a service provider to provision parameters for the IGP 
   for a PPVPN must be provided. This includes link level metrics, 
   capacity, QoS capability, and restoration parameters. 
    
6.2.4  Provisioning Network Access 
   A service provider must have the means to provision network access 
   between SP-managed PE and CE, as well as the case where the customer 
   manages the CE. 
 
6.2.5  Provisioning Security Services 
   When a security service is requested, an SP must have the means to 
   provision the entities and associated parameters involved with the 
   service. For example, for IPsec service, tunnels, options, keys, and 
   other parameters must be provisioned at either the CE and/or PE. In 
   the case of a intrusion detection service, the filtering and 
   detection rules must be provisioned on a VPN basis. 
    
 
Carugi et al    Informational - Expires September 2002              38                Service requirements for Layer 3 PPVPNs     March, 2002 
 
 
6.2.6  Provisioning VPN Resource Parameters 
   A service provider must have a means to dynamically provision 
   resources associated with VPN services. For example, in a PE-based 
   service, the number and size of virtual switching and forwarding 
   table instances must be provisionable. 
    
   Dynamic VPN resource assignment is crucial to cope with the frequent 
   changes requests from customer's (e.g., sites joining or leaving a 
   VPN), as well as to achieve scalability. The PEs should be able to 
   dynamically assign the VPN resources. This capability is especially 
   important for dial and wireless VPN services. 
    
   If an SP supports a "Dynamic Bandwidth management" service, then the 
   dates, times, amounts and interval required to perform requested 
   bandwidth allocation change(s) must be traceable for accounting 
   purposes. 
    
   If an SP supports a "Dynamic Bandwidth management" service, then the 
   provisioning system must be able to make requested changes within the 
   ranges and bounds specified in the Service Level Agreement (SLA). 
   Example SLA parameters are response time and probability of being 
   able to service such a request  
    
6.2.7  Provisioning Value-Added Service Access 
   A PPVPN service provides controlled access between a set of sites 
   over a common backbone. However, many service providers also offer a 
   range of value-added services, for example: Internet access, firewall 
   services, intrusion protection, IP telephony and IP Centrex, 
   application hosting, backup, etc. It is outside of the scope of this 
   document to define if and how these different services interact with 
   the VPN in order to solve issues such as addressing, integrity and 
   security. However, the VPN service must be able to provide access to 
   these various types of value-added services. 
    
   A VPN service should allow the SP to supply the customer with 
   different kinds of standard IP services like DNS, NTP and RADIUS 
   needed for ordinary network operation and management. The provider 
   should be able to provide IP services to multiple customers from one 
   or many servers. 
    
   A firewall function may be required to restrict access to the PPVPN 
   from the Internet [Y.1311].  
    
   A managed firewall service must be carrier grade. For redundancy and 
   failure recovery, a means for firewall fail-over should be provided. 
   Managed firewall services that may be provided include dropping 
   specified protocol types, intrusion protection, traffic-rate limiting 
   against malicious attacks, etc.  
    
   Managed firewalls must be supported on a per-VPN basis, although 
   multiple VPNs may be supported by the same physical device (e.g., in 
   network or PE-based solution).  Managed firewalls should be provided 
 
Carugi et al    Informational - Expires September 2002              39                Service requirements for Layer 3 PPVPNs     March, 2002 
 
 
   at the major access point(s) for the PPVPN. Managed firewall services 
   may be embedded in the CE or PE devices, or implemented in standalone 
   devices. 
    
   The NMS should allow a customer to outsource the management of an IP 
   networking service to the SP providing the VPN or a third party.  
    
   The management system should support collection of information 
   necessary for optimal allocation of IP services in response to 
   customer orders. 
    
   Network-based firewall services must be carrier grade. For redundancy 
   and failure recovery, a means for firewall fail-over should be 
   provided. Network-based firewall services that may be provided 
   include dropping specified protocol types, intrusion detection, 
   traffic-rate limiting against malicious attacks, etc.  
    
   Network-based firewalls must be supported on a per-VPN basis, 
   although multiple VPNs may be supported by the same physical device.  
   Network-based firewalls should be provided at the major access 
   point(s) for the PPVPN. Network-based firewall services may be 
   embedded in the PE equipment, or implemented in standalone equipment. 
    
   Reachability to and from the Internet to sites within a VPN must be 
   configurable by an SP. This could be controlled by configuring 
   routing policy to control distribution of VPN routes advertised to 
   the Internet.  
    
6.2.8  Provisioning Hybrid VPN Services  
   Configuration of interworking or interconnection between PPVPN 
   solutions should be also supported. Ensuring that security and end-
   to-end QoS issues are provided consistently should be addressed. 
    
6.3 Accounting 
   Many service providers require collection of measurements regarding 
   resource usage for accounting purposes. The NMS may need to correlate 
   accounting information with performance and fault management 
   information to produce billing that takes into account SLA provisions 
   for periods of time where the SLS is not met.  
    
   A PPVPN solution must describe how the following accounting functions 
   can be provided: 
   - measurements of resource utilization, 
   - collection of accounting information, 
   - storage and administration of measurements. 
    
   Some providers may require near-real time reporting of measurement 
   information, and may offer this as part of a customer network 
   management service. 
    
   If an SP supports a "Dynamic Bandwidth management" service, then the 
   dates, times, amounts and interval required to perform requested 
 
Carugi et al    Informational - Expires September 2002              40                Service requirements for Layer 3 PPVPNs     March, 2002 
 
 
   bandwidth allocation change(s) must be traceable for monitoring and 
   accounting purposes. 
    
   Solutions should state compliance to accounting requirements, as 
   described in section 1.7 of RFC 2975. 
    
6.4 Performance Management  
   Performance management includes functions involved with monitoring 
   and collecting performance data regarding devices, facilities, and 
   services, as well as determination of conformance to Service Level 
   Specifications (SLS), such as QoS and availability measurements. 
    
   Performance management should also support analysis of important 
   aspects of a PPVPN , such as bandwidth utilization, response time, 
   availability, QoS statistics, and trends based on collected data. 
    
6.4.1  Performance Monitoring  
   The NMS must monitor device behavior to evaluate performance metrics 
   associated with a service level agreement. Different measurement 
   techniques may be necessary depending on the service for which an SLA 
   is provided. Example services are QoS, security, multicast, and 
   temporary access. These techniques may be either intrusive or non-
   intrusive depending on the parameters being monitored. 
    
   The NMS must also monitor aspects of the VPN not directly associated 
   with an SLA, such as resource utilization, state of devices and 
   transmission facilities, as well as control of monitoring resources 
   such as probes and remote agents at network access points used by 
   customers and mobile users.  
    
6.4.2  SLA and QoS management features  
   The NMS should support SLAs between the SP and the various customers 
   according to the corresponding SLSes by measurement of the indicators 
   defined within the context of the SLA, on a regular basis. 
    
   The NMS should use the QOS parameter measurement definitions, 
   techniques, and methods as defined by the IETF IP Performance Metrics 
   (IPPM) working group for delay, loss, and delay variation.  
    
   The NMS should support allocation and measurement of end-to-end QoS 
   requirements to QoS parameters for one or more network(s). 
    
   Devices supporting PPVPN SLAs should have real-time performance 
   measurements that have indicators and threshold crossing alerts. Such 
   thresholds should be configurable.  
    
6.5 Security Management 
   The security management function of the NMS must include management 
   features to guarantee the security of devices, access connections, 
   and protocols within the PPVPN network(s), as well as the security of 
   customer data and control as described in section 5.9.  
    
 
Carugi et al    Informational - Expires September 2002              41                Service requirements for Layer 3 PPVPNs     March, 2002 
 
 
6.5.1  Management Access Control 
   Management access control determines the privileges that a user has 
   for particular applications and parts of the network. Without such 
   control, only the security of the data and control traffic is 
   protected, leaving the devices providing the PPVPN network 
   unprotected. Access control capabilities protect these devices to 
   ensure that users have access to only the resources and applications 
   to which they are authorized to use.  
    
   In particular, access to the routing and switching resources managed 
   by the SP must be tightly controlled to prevent and/or effectively 
   mitigate a malicious attack. 
    
6.5.2  Authentication  
   Authentication is the process of verifying that the sender is 
   actually is who he or she says they are. The NMS must support 
   standard methods for authenticating users attempting to access 
   management services.  
    
   Scalability is critical as the number of nomadic/mobile clients is 
   increasing rapidly. The authentication scheme implemented for such 
   deployments must be manageable for large numbers of users and VPN 
   access points. 
    
   Support for strong authentication schemes shall be supported to 
   ensure the security of both VPN access point-to-VPN access point  (PE 
   to PE) and client-to-VPN Access point (CE-to-PE) communications. This 
   is particularly important to prevent VPN access point spoofing.  VPN 
   Access Point Spoofing is the situation where an attacker tries to 
   convince a PE or CE that the attacker is the VPN Access Point.  If an 
   attacker can convinces a PE or CE of that, then the device will send 
   VPN traffic to the attacker (who could forward it on to your true 
   access point after compromising confidentially or integrity). 
    
   In other words, a non-authenticated VPN AP can be spoofed with a man-
   in-the-middle attack, because the endpoints never verify each other.  
   A weakly-authenticated VPN AP may be subject to such an attack. 
   However, strongly-authenticated VPN APs are not subject to such  
   attacks, because the man-in-the-middle cannot authenticate as the 
   real AP, due to the strong authentication algorithms. 
    
6.6 Network Management Techniques 
   Each PPVPN solution approach must specify the management or policy 
   information bases (MIBs or PIBS) for network elements involved in 
   PPVPN services. This is an essential requirement in network 
   provisioning. The approach should identify any information not 
   contained in a standard MIB related to FCAPS that is necessary to 
   meet a generic requirement. 
    
   The IP VPN Policy Information model should reuse the policy    
   information models being developed in parallel for specific IP    
   network capabilities [IM-REQ]. This includes the QoS Policy 
 
Carugi et al    Informational - Expires September 2002              42                Service requirements for Layer 3 PPVPNs     March, 2002 
 
 
   Information Model_[QPIM] and the IPSEC Configuration Policy Model_ 
   [IPSECIM]. The information model should provide the OSS with adequate 
   "hooks" to correlate service level specifications with traffic data 
   collected from network elements. The use of policies includes rules 
   that control corrective actions taken by OSS components responsible 
   for monitoring the network and ensuring that it meets service 
   requirements. 
    
   Additional requirements on information models are given in reference 
   [IM-PPVPN]. In particular, an information model must allow a service 
   provider to change network dimensions with minimal influence on 
   provisioning issues. The adopted model should be applicable to both 
   small/medium size networks and large-scale PPVPN solutions.  
    
   Some service providers may require systems that visually, audibly, or 
   logically present FCAPS information to internal operators and/or 
   customers. 
    
7 Security Considerations 
   Security considerations occur at several levels and dimensions within 
   Provider Provisioned VPNs, as detailed within this document. This 
   section provides a summary with references to supporting detailed 
   information.  
    
   The requirements in this document separate the notion of traditional 
   security requirements, such as integrity, confidentiality, and 
   authentication as detailed in section 3.4 from that of isolating (or 
   separating) the exchange of forwarded packets and exchange of routing 
   information between specific sets of sites, as defined in sections 
   2.3 and 3.3. Further detail on security requirements are given from 
   the customer and service provider perspectives in sections 3.4 and 
   4.9, respectively. In an analogous manner, further detail on traffic 
   and routing isolation requirements are given from the customer and 
   service provider perspectives in sections 3.3 and 4.8, respectively. 
    
   Furthermore, requirements regarding management of security from a 
   service provider perspective are described in section 6.5.
