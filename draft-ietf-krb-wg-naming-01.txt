Abstract

   This document defines new naming constraints for reserved Keberos
   names.  A reserved name can be either a Kerberos principal name or a
   Kerberos realm name.  All reserved names defined in this document are
   critical, so if a reserved name is unknown, authentication MUST fail.

Internet-Draft               Kerberos Naming                October 2006


1.  Introduction

   Occasionally protocol designers need to designate a Kerberos
   principal name or a Kerberos realm name to have special meanings,
   other than identifying a particular instance.  An example is that the
   the anonymous principal name and the anonymous realm name are defined
   for the Kerberos anonymity support [ANON].  This anonymity name pair
   conveys no more meaning than that the client's identity is not
   disclosed.  In the case of the anonymity support, it is critical that
   deployed Kerberos implementations that do not support anonymity MUST
   fail the authentication if the anonymity name pair is used, therefore
   no access is granted accidentally to a principal who's name happens
   to match with that of the anonymous identity.

   However Kerberos as defined in [RFC4120] does not have such reserved
   names.  As such, protocol designers have resolved to use exceedingly-
   unlikely-to-have-been-used names to avoid collision.  Even if a
   registry were setup to avoid collision for new implementations, there
   is no guarantee for deployed implementations to prevent accidental
   reuse of names that can lead to access being grantedly unexpectedly.

   The Kerberos realm name in [RFC4120] has a reserved name space
   although no specific name is defined and the criticality of unknown
   reserved realm names is not specified.

   This document is to remedy these by defining reserved Kerberos names.
   All reserved names defined based on this specification are critical:
   Authentication MUST fail if an unknown reserved name is used by
   conforming implementations.


2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Definitions

   In this section, reserved names are defined for both the kerberos
   principal name and the kerberos realm name.

3.1.  Reserved Kerberos Principal Names

   A new name type is defined for reserved principal names.  The
   Kerberos principal name is defined in Section 6.2 of [RFC4120].

            KRB_NT_RESERVED                                TBA

   The reserved principal name MUST have at least two or more
   KerberosString components, and the first component must be the string
   literal "RESERVED".

   For implementations conforming with this specification,
   authentication MUST fail with
   KRB_AP_ERR_RESERVED_PRINCIPAL_NAME_UNKNOWN if an unknown reserved
   principal name is used.  There is no accompanying error data for this
   error.

            KRB_AP_ERR_RESERVED_PRINCIPAL_NAME_UNKNOWN     TBA
                 -- a reserved Kerberos principal name is unknown

3.2.  Reserved Kerberos Realm Names

   Section 6.1 of [RFC4120] defines the "other" style realm name, a new
   type RESERVED is defined as a name of type "other", with the NAMETYPE
   part filled in with the word "RESERVED".

            other: RESERVED:realm-name

   This name type is designated for reserved Kerberos realms.

   For implementations conforming with this specification,
   authentication MUST fail with KRB_AP_ERR_RESERVED_REALM_NAME_UNKNOWN
   if an unknown reserved realm name is used.  There is no accompanying
   error data for this error.

            KRB_AP_ERR_RESERVED_REALM_NAME_UNKNOWN         TBA
                 -- a reserved Kerberos realm name is unknown


4.  Security Considerations

   If a reserved name is unknown, authentication MUST fail.  Otherwise,
   access can be granted unintentionally, resulting in a security
   weakness.

   Care MUST be taken to avoid accidental reuse of names.


5.  Acknowledgements

   with Clifford Newman and Sam Hartman.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document provides the framework for defining reserved Kerberos
   names and Kerberos realms.  A new IANA registry should be created to
   contain reserved Kerberos names and Kerberos realms that are defined
   based on this document.
