                        Binding Attribute Scope
                        draft-groves-core-bas-00

Abstract

   This document specifies an additional CoAP binding attribute that
   allows binding attributes to be scoped to an item (sub-resource) in a
   collection resource.  This allows synchronisation of multiple
   resources in a collection based on the value of one resource.

1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

2.  Introduction

   In some cases a CoAP client may require a notification of the value
   of a resource based on some condition associated with another
   resource.  For example: a client wants to be notified of the machine
   state once a temperature sensor threshold is crossed.  Currently the
   only way to implement this is for a client to be notified of the
   temperature resource change and then for the client to do a seperate
   read of the required resources.  It would be more efficient to
   provide the information in a single response.

   This document defines a new "Binding Attribute Scope" binding
   attribute to allow a client to request collection resource state
   synchronisation based on a conditional value of an item in the
   collection resource.

   The "Binding Attribute Scope" (bas) attribute is set on a collection
   and is used to indicate which item in a collection an Observe and
   associated binding attributes apply to.  A linked batch (or batch)
   interface (sect.4.3/[I-D.ietf-core-interfaces]) is used on the
   collection.  The client constructs a collection resource using the
   linked batch interface or uses a pre-provisioned collection via the

   batch interface to set the information that it requires.  By placing
   the required information in a collection it allows a GET on the
   collection to return all the information based on the conditional
   value of an item.

   Section Section 4 below indicates the text that would need to be
   added to [I-D.ietf-core-dynlink] to add the Binding Attribute Scope
   attribute.

   *Editor's note: Another option for a "Alternate Resource" was
   considered but some issues were identified.  The "Alternate Resource"
   (ar) attribute is set on the observed resource and is used to
   indicate the resource whose value is returned as an alternate to the
   observed resource's value.  This approach is logically different to
   binding attribute scope approach in that a request on one resource
   results in the value of another resource being returned.  It is also
   logically different that the client and server do not have the same
   view of the resource as a result of an observe.  The client has a
   view of another server resource.  This option could also return a
   collection if the alternate resource has been created as a
   collection.  This in itself may cause some issues.  In this case the
   Content-Format returned would not be from the original resource but
   from the alternate resource.  If a client indicate an accept option
   with a particular Content-Format for the alternate resource the
   original resource may not support it.  Also a the Content-Format (ct)
   Web Linking Attribute would be unlikely to return a content-format
   for the alternate resource.*

2.1.  Usage of a collection

   The current text of [I-D.ietf-core-interfaces] indicates that observe
   may be supported on an item in a collection not on the collection
   itself.  The "bas" binding attribute is only used on collection (e.g.
   batch, linked-batch) resources which enables the use of the binding
   attributes from [I-D.ietf-core-dynlink] on a collection.  The "bas"
   attribute points to one item in the collection.

   This approach does have the downside that it requires the use of a
   collection interface even if a single resource is required.  The
   scope of the synchronization is limited to the current collection.
   However the use of a collection to return the information does seem
   to fit with the principle that a GET of a resource should return the
   same representation as a notification.

2.2.  Multiple Conditions

   Given that the "bas" binding attribute only applies to one item/sub-
   resource in a collection it means that multiple resources cannot be
   used as conditions for a binding synchronization.  To allow the use
   of conditions on multiple resources to determine resource
   synchronization a different approach would be required.

   One approach would be to use the FETCH method [I-D.ietf-core-etch]
   with a set of request parameters.  A content type could be defined
   that allowed the binding attributes to be specified on multiple
   resources.

   For example:

   FETCH /s/?pmin=1&pmax=100 content-type=application/conditionals+json

   [
     {
       "n": "/s/light",
       "st": 5
     },
     {
       "n": "/s/temp",
       "st": 1
     },
     {
       "n": "/s/humidity",
       "lt": 40,
       "gt" 70
     }
   ]

   This approach would add complexity over the use of the bas binding
   attribute however such complexity may be warranted in certain use
   cases.  A new content-format would need to be defined.  This approach
   is for further study.

3.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this specification are to be interpreted as described
   in [RFC2119].

   This specification requires readers to be familiar with all the terms
   and concepts that are discussed in [RFC5988] and [RFC6690].

4.  Binding Attributes

   This document introduces one new attributes:

           +-------------------------+-----------+-------------+
           | Attribute Name          | Parameter | Data Format |
           +-------------------------+-----------+-------------+
           | Binding Attribute Scope | bas       | xsd:string  |
           +-------------------------+-----------+-------------+

                    Table 1: Binding Attribute Summary

   The xsd:string contains a Uri-Path.

4.1.  Binding Attribute Scope

   The binding attribute scope attribute allows a client to indicate
   that the binding attributes contained in the query apply to a certain
   item in a collection resource.

   The collection containing the Observed resource and the additional
   resources to be returned is first created through the use of the
   Batch or Linked-Batch [I-D.ietf-core-interfaces] interface.  The
   Linked-Batch allows a client to dynamically associate resources.

   The client then creates a binding (e.g. an Observe) with the
   collection indicating the required binding attributes (e.g. "gt",
   "lt" etc.) and to which sub-resource these apply through the use of
   the "bas" binding attribute containing a URI-path.

   If the server determines that the "bas" attribute contains an unknown
   URI-path then it responds with response code 4.04 "Not Found".

   State sychronisation occurs when the sub-resource (item) value meets
   the conditions indicated by the binding attributes.  When state
   synchronisation occurs the collection resource (including sub-
   resources) will be synchronised.

4.2.  Interactions

   The "bas" parameter modifies the scope of other binding attributes in
   a query to apply to the resource specified in the "bas" URI-path.

   *Editor's note: the interaction with sample time window/sample number
   window needs to be added if accepted.*

4.3.  Examples

   Given the resource links:

     Req: GET /.well-known/core
     Res: 2.05 Content (application/link-format)
     </s/>;rt="simple.sen";if="core.b",
     </s/light>;rt="simple.sen.light";if="core.s",
     </s/temp>;rt="simple.sen.tmp";if="core.s";obs,
     </s/humidity>;rt="simple.sen.hum";if="core.s"

4.3.1.  Example 1 - Item Binding Attribute

   A Req: GET /s?bas="temp"&gt=37
             Token: 0x4a
             Observe: 0
   would produce the following when temp exceeds 37:

     Res: 2.05 Content (application/senml+json)
     {"e":[
        { "n": "/s/light", "v": 123, "u": "lx" },
        { "n": "/s/temp", "v": 38, "u": "degC" },
        { "n": "/s/humidity", "v": 80, "u": "%RH" }],
     }

5.  Security Considerations

   As per 5/[I-D.ietf-core-dynlink].

6.  IANA Considerations

   None.
