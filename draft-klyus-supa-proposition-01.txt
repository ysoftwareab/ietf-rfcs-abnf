Abstract 

   The rapid growth in the variety and importance of traffic flowing
   over increasingly complex enterprise and service provider network
   architectures makes the task of network operations and management
   applications and deploying new services much more difficult.
   Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions (SUPA) defines an interface
   to a network management function that takes high-level, possibly
   network-wide policies as input and creates element configuration
   snippets as output. SUPA expresses policies using a generic policy
   information model, and outputs generic YANG data models.

1. Introduction 

   The rapid growth in the variety and importance of traffic
   flowing over increasingly complex enterprise and service
   provider network architectures makes the task of network
   operations and management applications and deploying new
   services much more difficult. In addition, network operators
   want to deploy new services quickly and efficiently. Two
   possible mechanisms for dealing with this growing difficulty
   are the use of software abstractions to simplify the design and
   configuration of monitoring and control operations and the use
   of programmatic control over the configuration and operation of
   such networks. Policy-based management can be used to combine
   these two mechanisms into an extensible framework.

   Policy statements can be used to express high-level network
   operator requirements directly, or from a set of management
   applications, to a network management or element system. The
   network management or element system can then interpret those
   requirements to control the configuration of network elements.

   Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions (SUPA) will define a
   generic policy information model (GPIM) for use in network
   operations and management applications. The GPIM represents
   different types of policies for controlling the configuration
   of network elements throughout the service development and
   deployment lifecycle. The GPIM will be translated into
   corresponding YANG data models to define interoperable
   implementations that can exchange and modify generic policies
   using protocols such as NETCONF/RESTCONF.

   Management applications will benefit from using policy rules
   that enable scalable and consistent programmatic control over
   the configuration of network elements.

Internet-Draft            SUPA - Proposition                  June 2015
    

1.1. Problem Statement 

   Network operators are faced with networks of increasing size
   and complexity while trying to improve their quality and
   availability, as more and more business services depend on them.

1.2. Proposed Solution 

   SUPA enables network operators to express policies to control
   network configuration data models. SUPA provides a generic
   infrastructure that defines policies to control the configuration
   of network elements. The configuration process is independent of
   domain or type of application, and results in configuration
   according to YANG data models. 

   The power of policy management is its applicability to many
   different types of systems. This provides significant
   improvements in configuration agility, error detection, and
   uptime for operators. Many different types of actors can be
   identified that can use a policy management system, including
   applications, end-users, developers, network administrators,
   and operators. Each of these actors typically has different
   skills and uses different concepts and terminologies. For
   example, an operator may want to express that only Platinum and
   Gold users can use streaming and interactive multimedia
   applications. As a second example, an operator may want to
   define a more concrete policy rule that looks at the number of
   dropped packets. If, for example, this number exceeds a certain
   threshold value, then the applied queuing, dropping and
   scheduling algorithms could be changed in order to reduce the
   number of dropped packets.

   Both of the above examples can be referred to as "policy rules",
   but they take very different forms, since they are at different
   levels of abstraction and likely authored by different actors.
   The first example described a very abstract policy rule, and
   did not contain any technology-specific terms, while the second
   example included a more concrete policy rule and likely used
   technical terms of a general (e.g., IP address range and port
   numbers) as well as vendor-specific nature (e.g., specific
   algorithms implemented in a particular device). Furthermore,
   these two policy rules could affect each other. For example,
   Gold and Platinum users might need different device
   configurations to give the proper QoS markings to their
   streaming multimedia traffic. This is very difficult to do if a
   common policy framework does not exist.

Internet-Draft            SUPA - Proposition                  June 2015
    

   Note that SUPA is not limited to any one type of technology. 
   While the above two policies could be considered "QoS" 
   policies, other examples include: 

     - network elements must not accept passwords for logins 

     - all SNMP agents in this network must drop all SNMP traffic
       unless it is originating from, or targeting, the
       management network 

     - Periodically perform workload consolidation if average CPU
       utilization falls below X% 

   The above three examples are not QoS related, and will be
   explained more in Sections 4.1 and 4.2. This emphasizes the
   utility of the SUPA approach in being able to provide policies
   to control different types of network element configuration
   snippets. 

   There are many types of policies. SUPA differentiates between
   "management policies" and "embedded policies". Management
   policies are used to control the configuration of network
   elements. Management policies can be interpreted externally to
   network elements, and the interpretation typically results in
   configuration changes of collections of network elements. In
   contrast, "embedded policies" are policies that are embedded
   in the configuration of network elements, and are usually
   interpreted on network elements in isolation. Since embedded
   policies are interpreted in the network device, they are
   typically composed in a very specific fashion to run at
   near-realtime timescales.


1.3. Value of the SUPA Approach

   SUPA will achieve an optimization and reduction in the amount 
   of work required to define and implement policy-based data 
   models in the IETF. Part of this is due to the generic and 
   extensible framework of SUPA, which models concepts common to 
   any type of policy as well as provides two information models 
   (ECA and declarative), along with the associated YANG data 
   models.

Internet-Draft            SUPA - Proposition                  June 2015
    

   SUPA defines policy independent of where it is located. Other
   WGs are working on embedding policy in the configuration of a
   network element; SUPA is working on defining policies that
   can be interpreted external to network elements. Hence, SUPA
   policies can be used to define the behavior of and
   interaction between embedded policies.
      
   SUPA can also be used to derive a (more abstract) information
   model from a (more specific) data model. This extracts data
   that is part of a particular technology and/or application
   and makes it reusable, so that it can be applied to multiple
   technologies and/or domains.

   The SUPA policy framework defines a set of consistent, flexible,
   and scalable mechanisms for monitoring and controlling resources
   and services. It may be used to create a management and
   operations interface that can enable existing IETF data models,
   such as those from I2RS and L3SM, to be managed in a unified way
   that is independent of application domain, technology and vendor.
   Resource and service management become more effective, because
   policy defines the context that different operations, such as
   configuration, are applied to.
  

2. Framework for Generic Policy-based Management

   This section briefly describes the design and operation of the
   SUPA policy-based management framework.

2.1. Overview 

   Figure 1 shows a Service Management application creating and
   communicating policy rules to two different Network Manager and
   Network Controller elements.

   The Service Management application uses the Generic Policy
   Information Model (GPIM) to construct policies. The GPIM defines
   generic policy concepts, as well as two types of policies: ECA
   policy rules and declarative policy statements.

   An ECA policy rule is activated when its event clause is true;
   the condition clause is then evaluated and, if true, signals the
   execution of one or more actions in the action clause. This type
   of policy explicitly defines the current and desired states of
   the system being managed. In contrast, a declarative policy
   defines what actions to take, but not how to execute them.
   Declarative policies in SUPA take the form of a set of statements
   that present facts, and a conclusion of those facts.

Internet-Draft            SUPA - Proposition                  June 2015

   
   A set of Generic Policy Data Models are then created from the GPIM.
   These YANG data model policies are then used to control the
   configuration of network elements that model the service(s) to
   be managed using policy.

Internet-Draft            SUPA - Proposition                  June 2015


  An overview of the SUPA framework is shown in Figure 1. The 
  network elements used in this framework are: 
    
    SM: Service Management, which represents one or more network
    entities that are running and controlling network services.
    This model contains the following entities:
   
      Generic Policy Information Model: a model for defining policy
      rules that are independent of data repository, data definition,
      query, and implementation languages, and protocol.
   
      Generic Policy Data Model: a model of policy rules for that
      are dependent of data repository, data definition, query, and
      implementation languages, and protocol.
    
      Service Management Data Model: a model of a network service
      (e.g., a VPN) and resources (e.g., a device interface)
      required by the network service to be correctly deployed
      and executed on the physical and/or virtual topology.
   
    NM/NC: Network Manager / Controller, which represents one or
    more entities that are able to control the operation and
    management of a network infrastructure (e.g., a network
    topology that consists of Network Elements).
   
      Network Resource Data Model: a model of the physical and
      virtual network topology including the resource attributes
      (e.g., data rate or latency of links) and operational
      parameters needed to support service deployment over the
      network topology. An example of a network resource data model
      can be found in [ID.draft-contreras-supa-yang-network-topo].
   
    Network Element (NE), which can interact with local or remote
    NM/NC in order to exchange information, such as configuration
    information, policy enforcement capabilities, and network status.
 

2.2. Operation 

   There can be various types of policies, including policies that
   affect services and/or the configuration of individual or groups
   of network elements. There can be a centralized and/or
   distributed entity or set of entities that are responsible for
   the creation, management, and retirement of policy rules, which
   is known as a policy manager. It is not shown in Figure 1, since
   it can be located in the SM or in a separate location.

Internet-Draft            SUPA - Proposition                  June 2015


   SUPA will develop an information model for expressing policy at
   different levels of abstraction. Specifically, three information
   model fragments are envisioned: (i) a generic policy information
   model (GPIM) that defines concepts needed by policy management
   independent of the form and content of the policy, (ii) a more
   specific information model that refines the GPIM to specify how
   to build policy rules of the event-condition-action paradigm, and
   (iii) a more specific information model that refines the GPIM to
   specify how to build policy rules that declaratively specify what
   goals to achieve (but not how to achieve those goals); this is
   often called "intent-based" policy. These are all contained in
   the Generic Policy Information Model block in Figure 1.
    
   SUPA will translate the GPIM into concrete YANG data models that
   define how to manage and communicate policies between systems.
   Any number of ECA and/or declarative policy YANG data models may
   be instantiated from the GPIM. Providing a common foundation for
   defining two very different types of policies is a key benefit of
   SUPA.
    
   SUPA will not define network resource data models, which is out
   of scope. Instead, SUPA will make use of network resource data
   models defined by other WGs or SDOs.
    
   Service Management (SM) will send policy rules and associated
   data (e.g., service management data), to the NM/NC. The NM/NC
   will (in conjunction with network resource data models) then
   produce NE configurations. The SM communicates with the NM/NC
   using an appropriate protocol, such as NETCONF [RFC6241] or
   RESTCONF [ID.draft-ietf-netconf-restconf].
    
   NM/NC exchanges configuration information with NEs, and also the
   capabilities and status of NEs, which will be stored in network
   resource data models. It can use existing network management and
   signaling protocols, such as I2RS [I2RS], NETCONF [NETCONF], and
   RESTCONF [ID.draft-ietf-netconf-restconf].

2.3. Generic Policy Information Model 

   The GPIM provides a common vocabulary for representing concepts 
   that are common to expressing different types of policy, but 
   which are independent of language, protocol, repository, and 
   level of abstraction. This enables different policies at 
   different levels of abstraction to form a continuum, where more 
   abstract policies can be translated into more concrete policies, 
   and vice-versa. For example, new model requirements can be 
   derived by taking an existing data model and translate it into 
   the GPIM with extensions to define the new concepts from the 
   translated data model.

Internet-Draft            SUPA - Proposition                  June 2015


2.4. Refinement of the GPIM 

   An information model is abstract. As such, it cannot be directly
   instantiated (i.e., objects cannot be created directly from it).
   Therefore, SUPA translates its information model to two
   different data models (which can be instantiated).

   The two data models differ in how they represent policies.
   However, they share common characteristics and behavior.
   Therefore, it is easier to define a set of three information
   models to represent the common, ECA, and declarative parts of a
   policy. These three information models are then translated into
   either a YANG ECA data model or a YANG declarative data model.
   Note that because they share a common information model, they
   can be used separately or together (e.g., a declarative policy
   could call an ECA policy). This provides two different types
   of abstractions that serve different use cases. It also helps
   prove the genericity of the GPIM.

2.4.1. Event-Condition-Action Policy Information Model

   The SUPA ECA Policy Rule Information Model (EPRIM) represents a
   policy rule as a statement that consists of an event clause, a
   condition clause, and an action clause. This type of Policy
   Rule explicitly defines the current and desired states of the
   system being managed.

2.4.2. Declarative Policy Information Model

  The SUPA Logic Statement Information Model (SLSIM) is a set of
  (logic-based) propositions that form a (single) conclusion. A
  proposition is a type of statement that is either TRUE or FALSE.
  A proposition can be created from simpler propositions. This
  version of the SLSIM defines two forms of SUPA Logic Statements:
  one using propositional logic, and one using first order logic.


3. Application of Generic Policy-based Management

   This section provides examples of how SUPA can be used to
   define different types of policies. Examples applied to various
   domains, including system management, operations management,
   access control, routing, and service function chaining, are
   also included.

3.1. Declarative Examples

   Declarative policies are policies that describe what to do, but
   not how to do it. Declarative policies can apply to services
   and/or resources. Here are some simple examples:

   System and Operations Management Examples
   
     All routers and switches must have password login disabled.
   
       The above policy first resolves 'routers and switches' to a
       set of network elements, and then pushes the appropriate
       configuration to those network elements.
   
     All SNMP agents must enable SNMPv3 and must disable all other
     versions of SNMP.
   
       The above policy can be mapped to the leafs v1, v2c, and v3
       in the ietf-snmp YANG data model (RFC 7407).
   
     All SNMP traffic is dropped unless it originates from, or
     is directed to, an interface of a management system.
   
       The above policy first resolves a management system interface
       to a list of IP addresses, and then creates a set of suitable
       ACL rules that are configured on all network elements.
   
     Access to source code servers is limited to authorized
     Intranet users.
   
       The above policy assumes that the user is authenticated and
       authorized to access the code server. It places an additional
       constraint of requiring Intranet acces before granting access
       to the resource. Note that this rule is not limited to any
       one specific user or type of application.
   
     Periodically perform workload consolidation if average CPU
     utilization falls below X%.
   
       This policy moves workloads on a set of source VMs to a 
       common target VM if the average CPU utilization for the CPUs
       on the source VM is less than a predefined threshold. Note
       that the policy did not specify which particular VM to move
       the workload on the source VM to; that is part of the
       search and optimization algorithms that are implied, but
       not specified, by this policy.

   Service Management Examples

     Proactively monitor Gold Service users to ensure their SLAs
     are not violated.
   
       In the above policy, Gold Service is an aggregation of
       different traffic types, each with different constraints.
       The policy will dynamically create a service function chain
       based on the current context to ensure that the customer's
       SLA is not violated.

    Gold and Platinum Service Users must have WAN optimization
    applied to multimedia applications.

       The above policy applies only to users whose SLA types are
       either Gold or Platinum, and only for their multimedia
       applications. It installs a service chain that performs
       WAN optimization (and likely content caching and other
       services) to ensure that the SLAs of these users are not
       violated.


3.2. ECA Examples

   ECA policies are statements that consist of an event clause, a
   condition clause, and an action clause.

      Network Service Management Example
    
         Event:     too many interface alarms received from an
                    L3VPN service
         Condition: alarms resolve to the same interface within a
                    specified time period
         Action:    if error rate exceeds x% then put L3VPN service
                    to Error State and migrate users to one or more
                    new L3VPNs
    
      Security Management Example
    
         Event:     anomalous traffic detected in network
         Condition: determine the severity of the traffic
         Action:    apply one or more actions to affected NEs based
                    on the type of the traffic detected (along with
                    other factors, such as the type of resource
                    being attacked if the traffic is determined to
                    be an attack)

      Traffic Management Examples
    
         Event:     edge link close to being overloaded by
                    incoming traffic
         Condition: if link utilization exceeds Y% or if link
                    utilization average is increasing over a
                    specified time period
         Action:    change routing configuration to other peers
                    that have better metrics


         Event:     edge link close to be overloaded by
                    outgoing traffic
         Condition: if link utilization exceeds Z% or if link
                    utilization average is increasing over a
                    specified time period
         Action:    reconfigure affected nodes to use source-based
                    routing to balance traffic across multiple links

      Service Management Examples

         Event:     alarm received or periodic time period check
         Condition: CPU utilization level comparison
         Action:    no violation: no action
                    violation:
                      1) determine workload profile in time interval
                      2) determine complementary workloads (e.g.,
                         whose peaks are at different times in day)
                      3) combine workloads (e.g., using integer
                         programming)


         Event:     alarm received or periodic time check 
         Condition: if DSCP == AFxy and 
                    throughput < T% or packet loss > P% 
         Action:    no: no action 
                    yes: remark to AFx'y'; reconfigure queuing;
                    configure shaping to S pps; ...

   Note: it is possible to construct an ECA policy rule that is
   directly tied to configuration parameters; this is in general
   not possible for declarative policy. The value of declarative
   policy is in expression of the goal of the policy, and the
   freedom in implementing that goal. The value of ECA is in more
   clearly specifying what needs to be done.

3.3. ECA plus Declarative Example

   The fundamental reason that SUPA defines two different types of 
   policy rules is to enable different actors to express policy in 
   a manner conducive to their roles. The SGPIM defines concepts 
   that are common to both the EPRIM and the SLSIM. This enables 
   these two types of policies to be used together to provide a 
   more powerful definition of the goals of the policy as well as
   how to implement those goals.

   For example, compare the ECA and declarative forms of the SLA
   Service Management Policy:

     Declarative form:
       Proactively monitor Gold Service users to ensure their SLAs
       are not violated.

     ECA form:
         Event:     alarm received or periodic time check 
         Condition: if DSCP == AFxy and 
                    throughput < T% or packet loss > P% 
         Action:    no: no action 
                    yes: remark to AFx'y'; reconfigure queuing;
                    configure shaping to S pps; ...


   The declarative policy is more abstract than its ECA counterpart, 
   since the declarative version expresses intent without defining 
   which specific network elements are affected and how the
   configuration of those network elements should be changed. The
   above ECA policy rule is written in a high-level form, but note
   that it still is specifying how to monitor the Gold Service, how
   to determine if the SLA is being violated, and which actions to
   take.

   The execution of the declarative example could result in one or
   more ECA policy rules being triggered, such as the one above.
   Similarly, an ECA policy rule could trigger additional ECA policy
   rules to be evaluated. For example, the above ECA rule could be
   rewritten so that if the condition was satisfied, then each of
   the actions shown could be their own policy rules. This provides
   additional flexibility through reusing policy rules and the
   components of policy rules.

4. Related Work

4.1. Related Work within the IETF

4.1.1. I2RS Working Group

   I2RS defines an interface that interacts with the routing 
   system using a collection of protocol-based control or 
   management interfaces. Users of I2RS interfaces are typically 
   management applications and controllers. SUPA does not directly 
   interface to the routing system. Rather, SUPA uses data 
   produced by I2RS (e.g., topological information) to construct 
   its policies. 

   It is envisioned that SUPA will use work produced by I2RS. This 
   in particular applies to the topology work done in the I2RS 
   working group, since topology information is often necessary for 
   the interpretation of SUPA policies.

4.1.2. L3SM Working Group

   L3SM defines an L3 VPN service model that can be used for 
   communication between customers and network operators. This
   model enables an orchestration application or customers to
   request network services provided by L3 VPN technologies. The
   implementation of network services is often guided by specific
   policies, and SUPA provides a tool that can help with the
   mapping of L3 VPN service requests to L3 VPN configurations of
   network elements. 

4.1.3. ALTO Working Group

   The ALTO working group defined an architecture for exposing
   topology information, more specifically the cost of paths
   through an infrastructure, as defined in [RFC7285]. ALTO
   services are able to provide network maps defined as groups of
   endpoints. Endpoints are provider-defined entities, and can
   therefore represent any granularity of network, from the
   physical to groups of networks following similar paths or
   restraints. Although this model can represent different levels
   of granularities, it is not clear if it could be adapted easily
   for other purposes than providing cost maps in the context of
   ALTO. The ALTO model is meant to be used outside of the trust
   domain of an ISP by external clients.

   SUPA does not generate data that is similar to ALTO. Rather,
   SUPA could use ALTO data as part of its policies to configure
   services and/or resources.

4.1.4. TEAS Working Group

   The Traffic Engineering Architecture and Signaling (TEAS)
   working group is responsible for defining MPLS- and GMPLS-based
   Traffic Engineering architectures that enable operators to
   control how specific traffic flows are treated within their
   networks. It covers YANG models for a traffic engineering
   database. In coordination with other working groups (I2RS)
   providing YANG models for network topologies.

   Both TEAS and SUPA use YANG data models. SUPA does not generate
   traffic engineering (TE) data. However, SUPA could use TE data
   as part of its policies for configuring resources and/or
   services.

   SUPA could also define policies that define which service,
   path, and link properties to use for a given customer, and
   consequently, which protocol extensions to use. TEAS data could
   also be used to enable operators to define how particular
   traffic flows are treated in a more abstract (but still
   consistent) manner.

4.1.5. BESS Working Group

   The BGP Enabled Services (BESS) working group defines and
   extends network services that are based on BGP. This includes
   BGP/MPLS IP provider-provisioned L3VPNs, L2VPNs, BGP-enabled
   VPN solutions for use in data center networking, and extensions
   to BGP-enabled solutions to construct virtual topologies in
   support of services such as Service Function Chaining. The
   working group is also chartered to work on BGP extensions to
   YANG models and data models for BGP-enabled services.

   Both BESS and SUPA use YANG data models. SUPA could generate
   BGP configurations by using data defined by BESS as part of
   its policies for configuring resources and/or services.

   SUPA could also define policies that govern different aspects
   of services defined by BESS.

4.1.6. SFC Working Group

   The Service Function Chaining (SFC) working group defines a
   mechanism where traffic is classified; that classification is
   then use to select an ordered set of services to pass the
   traffic through.

Internet-Draft            SUPA - Proposition                  June 2015

   Both SFC and SUPA use YANG data models. SUPA could define
   policies that augment the functionality of SFC in several
   different ways, including: (1) path selection based on context,
   (2) which set of mechanisms to use to steer traffic through
   which set of service functions, (3) simplify the definition of
   dynamic service function chains (e.g., service paths that
   change based upon a set of data that is discovered at runtime),
   and (4) scalable mechanisms to monitor and control the
   configuration of SFC components.

4.1.7. NVO3 Working Group

   The NVO3 group proposes a way to virtualize the network edge
   for data centers in order to be able to move virtual instances
   without impacting their network configuration. This is realized
   through a centrally controlled overlay layer-3 network. The
   NVO3 work is not about defining policy information; rather, it
   uses policy information to perform some functions. Both NVO3 and
   SUPA use YANG data models. SUPA could define policies that define
   how the logically centralized network virtualization management
   entity (or entities) of NVO3 behave (e.g., the functions in the
   network virtualization control plane).

4.1.8. ACTN Working Group

   The ACTN proposed work, as described in [actn] framework, has
   two main goals, the abstraction of multiple optical transport
   domains into a single controller offering a common abstract
   topology, and the splitting of that topology into abstract
   client views that are usually a fraction of the complete
   network. The ACTN work is therefore about unification of
   several physical controllers into a virtual one, and also about
   the segmentation, isolation and sharing of network resources.
   The ACTN work is not about defining policy information. Both ACTN
   and SUPA use YANG data models. SUPA could define policies that
   define the behavior of the controller.

4.1.9. Previous IETF Policy Models

   SUPA is technology-neutral, previous RFCs weren't. SUPA defines a
   common structure from which both ECA and declarative policies can
   be defined and combined; this was not possible in previous RFCs.
   Previous RFCs do NOT define metadata, and do NOT enable policies
   to formally define obligation, permission, and related concepts.
   Finally, SUPA uses software patterns, which previous RFCs didn't.

4.2.1. TM Forum

   The TM Forum (a.k.a., the TeleManagement Forum) develops
   standards and best practices, research, and collaborative
   programs focused on digital business transformation. It
   consists of three major programs:

      1) Agile Business and IT
      2) Customer Centricity (experience)
      3) Open Digital Ecosystem

   Of these, the ZOOM (Zero-touch Orchestration, Operations, and
   Management) project, located in the Agile Business and IT
   project, is the main sub-project in this area that is of
   interest to SUPA.

   Within ZOOM, the Foundational Studies project contains work on
   an information model and management architecture that are
   directly relevant to SUPA. The TMF Information Model, Policy,
   and Security working groups are involved in this work.

   The ZOOM information model updates the existing Shared
   Information and Data (SID) information model to add support for
   the management of physical and virtual infrastructure, event-
   and data-driven systems, policy management (architecture and
   model), metadata for describing and prescribing behavior that
   can support changes at runtime, and access control.

   The policy information model defines event-condition-action
   (ECA), declarative (intent-based), utility function, and
   promise policies. The work in [ID.draft-strassner-supa-generic-
   policy-info-model] is based on this work. It currently extends
   the ZOOM ECA model and provides additional detail not currently
   present in ZOOM; the next version of this draft will do the
   same for declarative policies.

   There is currently no plan to use the utility function and
   promise policies of ZOOM. Finally, it should be noted that
   the data model work planned for SUPA is not currently planned
   for the ZOOM project.

4.2.2. MEF

   The MEF (originally named the Metro Ethernet Forum) develops
   architecture, service and management specifications related to
   Carrier Ethernet (CE). The CE architecture includes the
   definition of several interfaces specific to CE like the User
   Network Interface (UNI) and External Network Network Interface

Internet-Draft            SUPA - Proposition                  June 2015


   (ENNI). Specifications developed in this space include the
   definitions of CE services, CE service attributes, Ethernet
   Access Services, Class of Service, OAM and Management
   interfaces, Service Activation and Test. The more recent vision of
   the MEF is described as The Third Network, and includes plans to
   develop Lifecycle Service Orchestration with APIs for existing
   network, NFV, and SDN implementations enabling Agile, Assured,
   and Orchestrated Services. This stage of the MEF activity is now
   in early phases with focus on architectural work.

   The MEF has developed a number of Information and Data Models,
   and has recently started a project that used YANG to model and
   manage the services defined by the MEF. While the MEF has created
   rigorous definitions of these services, they are specific to
   transport technology, and they do not include and rely on policies.

4.2.3. Open Daylight

   Open Daylight network controller implements a number of models
   through its service abstraction Layer (MD-SAL) based on draft
   IETF Yang models. Open Daylight is an open source project.

4.2.3.1. Network Intent Composition (NIC)

   The Network Intent Composition project aims at providing better
   flexibility by using declarative policies. It does not cover
   other types of policies, such as ECA policy rules. The intent-
   based interface aims to provide a high level of abstraction,
   primarily for use by an application developer. Its progress
   has recently stalled.

4.2.3.2. Group Based Policy

   The Group Based Policy project defines an application-centric
   policy model for Open Daylight that separates information about
   application connectivity requirements from information about
   the underlying details of the network infrastructure. The model
   is positioned as declarative, but uses a relational approach to
   specifying policy.

4.2.4. Open Networking Foundation

   The ONF created a group responsible of defining northbound
   interfaces, but this hasn't lead to the publication of
   standards in this area so far. A blog entry on the ONF web site
   showed an interest in using the principle of intents at ONF,
   but no details were provided on the status of this project. A
   members-only whitepaper was recently published.

4.2.5. OpenStack

   OpenStack software controls large pools of compute, storage,
   and networking resources throughout a datacenter, managed
   through a dashboard or via the OpenStack API. OpenStack works
   with popular enterprise and open source technologies making it
   ideal for heterogeneous infrastructure. Few of the below
   mentioned OpenStack projects provides policy abstraction and
   better flexibility to the user.

4.2.5.1. Group-Based Policy

   The Group-Based Policy project for OpenStack Neutron is built
   around entities assembled in Endpoints Groups (EPG) that
   provide or consume Contracts. Such Contracts are hierarchical
   entities containing policy rules. A first version was released
   in January 2015, based on the Juno release. This type of
   approach is more relational than declarative, but could be used
   to describe a large amount of possible scenarios. It has the
   advantage of providing a relatively simple policy model that
   covers a large applicability. From an OpenStack point of view,
   the scope of Group-Based Policies is limited to networking
   within the Neutron module.

4.2.5.2. Congress

   The Congress project within OpenStack provides a way to define
   complex policies using extensions to the Datalog language.
   Datalog is entirely declarative, and its evaluation is based on
   first-order logic with restrictions. This gives it interesting
   properties, such as providing the same result no matter the order
   in which the statements are made. The language allows for the
   definition of types and for active enforcement or verification
   of the policies.

   There is a significant body of knowledge and experience relating
   to declarative languages and their implementation. Congress
   policies aim at manipulating objects exposed by multiple
   OpenStack modules, and is therefore larger in scope than network
   element policies.

   The declarative policies of SUPA are similar to those in Congress;
   the primary difference relies in the characteristics and behavior
   (in the sense of restrictions) of the underlying logic for
   Congress vs. SUPA. SUPA's propositional logic statements are
   simpler but more limited than Congress, while SUPA's first-order
   logic statements are more complex but more powerful than those
   of Congress. If desired, a Congress model could be easily added
   to SUPA.

4.2.6. The NEMO Project

   The NEMO project is a research activity aiming at defining a 
   simple declarative framework for networking. The NEMO syntax is 
   not based on an existing language and covers the basic elements 
   for network manipulation such as nodes, links and flows. The 
   NEMO project has been successfully demonstrated at IETF-91, 
   along with a companion graphical user interface. This work is
   organized in the Intent-Based NEMO (IBNEMO) mail list within
   the IETF.

   NEMO declarative policies are different than SUPA declarative
   policies. NEMO uses a flatter, simpler object model with fewer
   objects, does not support ECA policies, and emphasizes the use
   of a language. SUPA uses a richer class model that offers both
   ECA and declarative policies. SUPA has not proposed a language.

4.2.7. The Floodlight Project

   The Floodlight is an OpenFlow-enabled SDN controller. It uses 
   another open source project called Indigo to support OpenFlow 
   and manage southbound devices. The Indigo agent also supports 
   an abstraction layer to make it easy to integrate with physical 
   and virtual switches. It supports configuration of an abstraction 
   layer so that it can configure OpenFlow in hybrid mode.  

4.2.8. The ONOS Project

   The ONOS is an SDN controller design for Service Provider networks.
   It uses a distributed architecture, and supports abstraction for
   both southbound and northbound interfaces. Its modules are managed
   as OSGi bundles. It is an open source project.

   ONOS announced an "application-intent framework", which is similar
   in nature to SUPA's declarative policies. However, no object model
   or language has been defined yet.

    
5. Conclusions: the Value of SUPA

   SUPA) defines an interface to a network management function that
   takes high-level, possibly network-wide policies as input and
   creates element configuration snippets as output. SUPA expresses
   policies using a generic policy information model, and produces
   generic policy YANG data models. SUPA focuses on management
   policies that control the configuration of network elements.
   Management policies can be interpreted outside of network
   elements, and the interpretation typically results in
   configuration changes of collections of network elements.

   not in the scope of SUPA. In contrast to policies targeted by
   SUPA, embedded policies are usually interpreted on network
   elements in isolation, and often at timescales that require the
   representation of embedded policies to be optimized for a
   specific purpose.

   The SUPA information model generalizes common concepts from
   multiple technology-specific data models, and makes it reusable.
   Conceptually, SUPA can be used to interface and manage existing
   and future data models produced by other IETF working groups.
   In addition, by defining an object-oriented information model
   with metdata, the characteristics and behavior of data models
   can be better defined.
