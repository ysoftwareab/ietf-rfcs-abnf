Abstract

   This document defines how a device encapsulates Assisted Global 
   Positioning System (A-GPS) data to ask a Location Information Server
   (LIS) to calculate the device's position, and return that 
   information to the device.  This communication will be completed 
   using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), using Presence Filters 
   specific to A-GPS in a (SUBSCRIBE) request, and a Presence 
   Information Data Format - Location Object (PIDF-LO) as the (NOTIFY) 
   reply.

1.  Introduction  

   US Global Positioning System (GPS) is widely accepted to enable 
   clients to calculate their location based on data the device 
   receives from satellites. In order to compute the location, an 
   entity must triangulate data received from at least three 
   satellites. For an initial cold start, the GPS device must wait a 
   certain time called the Time-to-First-Fix (TTFF), before it can 
   successfully begin reporting the location. Under certain 
   circumstances, this time can be as long as 12 minutes. The device 
   must also have a line of site view to at least three satellites to 
   successfully get a position fix. This also causes additional battery
   drain on mobile devices. 

   In order to address these line of site and timing problems, 
   primarily to reduce the TTFF, a solution called the Assisted GPS 
   (A-GPS) has been deployed [IEEE-1]. A-GPS works by allowing devices 
   to obtain ephemeris data from an Assisted GPS server. 

   Assisted GPS enables faster computation of the location information 
   at the clients. This document describes the messaging required to 
   enable Assisted GPS computation on client devices - based on the SIP
   subscription model established in RFC 3265 [RFC3265], as well as

   augmenting the PIDF-LO, as defined in RFC 4119 [RFC4119], to 
   encapsulate additional location related data to a Assisted GPS 
   server.  Additionally, this document will define a set of Presence 
   filters to identify within the SIP SUBSCRIBE what is wanted in the 
   NOTIFY.  This set of filters is an extension of the SIP 'Location 
   Get' filters first described in here [ID-SIP-GET].


1.1 Terminology and Acronym Explosion

   The following terms will be used within this document

   A-GPS                Assisted Global Positioning System - A method 
                        of GPS positioning where the receiver is 
                        assisted through a means other than directly 
                        from the GPS satellites.

   BS                   Base Station [RFC5154] - A generalized 
                        equipment set that provides connectivity,

                        station and IEEE 802.16 network. The term BS 
                        can also be applied to cellular systems 

   DGPS                 Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) 
                        is an enhancement to Global Positioning System 
                        that uses a network of fixed, ground-based 
                        reference stations to broadcast the difference 
                        between the positions indicated by the 
                        satellite systems and the known fixed positions

   Ephemeris            An ephemeris is a table of values that gives 
                        the positions of astronomical objects in the

                        Mobile Node (MN) [RFC5121] - The terms 
                        subscriber station, mobile station, and mobile 
                        node are used to convey the same semantics in

2.  Assisted-GPS Communications Overview

   The GPS devices must have network connectivity for the 'A' in A-GPS 
   in order to get this ephemeris data from the server.  These devices 
   usually have a cellular or wireless LAN connection in order to 
   contact the Assisted GPS server. The Assisted GPS server, with good 
   satellite reception and computational power, can assist the client 
   devices to obtain satellite constellation information known as the 
   almanac, satellite ephemeris data, thereby reducing the TTFF. In 
   addition to improving the TTFF, A-GPS requires less computational 
   power and consumes less power at client devices when compared to 
   traditional GPS.

   A device capable of using Assisted GPS obtains dynamic assistance 
   information from the Location Information Server (LIS), and requires
   connectivity or attachment to the network. The A-GPS capable device 
   can take advantage of assists during at least the following 
   scenarios:

   1. during boot time - when a device initially powers up
   2. at network attachment time - when a device detects attachment to 
      a network
   3. Periodically, while attached to the network.
   4. On demand, while attached to the network.

   The type of server that does this calculation is some form of a LIS,
   one that is A-GPS capable.  The device needs to contact a LIS, and 
   request that it do the conversion.  The answer from the LIS will be 
   the conversion that is used.

   A-GPS does not have to be a one-time only communication (see Figure 
   1.).  The device can create a subscription with the LIS for periodic
   or triggered updates (see Figure 2).  If triggered updates are a 
   requirement, then SIP appears to be the only IETF protocol (to date)
   that can accomplish this function, based on the subscription model 
   it has.

    Figure 2. Single Request, Multiple Responses for A-GPS

   In Figure 2, the request might create a subscription, asking that 
   more than one notification be sent back to the device.  These 
   notifications can be periodic, meaning at a certain interval in time
   until the subscription is updated or terminated.  These 
   notifications can be triggered by the device moving, or thinks it 
   has moved. How a device detects this is out of scope of this 
   document.


3.  A-GPS Elements Defined

   RFC 4119 extended the PIDF [RFC3863] <status> element with a complex
   element called <geopriv>.  PIDF-LO also created two major 
   subselements which are encapsulated within <geopriv>: one for 
   location information and one for usage rules.  This document does 
   not affect the usage rules subelement.  The <location-info> element 


Polk                    Expires January 7, 2009                [Page 5]
Internet-Draft          PIDF-LO with A-GPS Data               July 2008

   MUST contain one or more directives indicating the XML schema(s) 
   that are used for geographic location formats, according to RFC 
   4119.  This document creates a new schema under the <location-info> 
   element, effectively lateral to geo-coordinate location and civic 
   location already established within RFC 4119.

   This extension to PIDF-LO creates the <gp:a-gps> element.  Below are
   the mandatory and optional XML subelements contained within the 
   <gp:a-gps> element, with definitions and value ranges.  Out of 
   respect for the WiMAX Forum, this payload will be minimal in size, 
   because WiMAX deals with power constrained devices communicating 
   over low speed links (or high speed links shared by many devices - 
   sometimes allowing for each to only have a small part of the 
   available bandwidth), therefore this needs to be thought of in terms
   of how the XML can be placed into a binary bit-map.

   There are 4 message types for adding A-GPS to the PIDF-LO,

      Location-Request, 
      Location-Response, 
      Assisted-Request and 
      Assisted-Response.  


   Some of the individual fields are mandatory (M), and some are 
   optional (O).  Each of the message types starts the same 3 elements,
   with the following elements:

   A-GPS Header (Mandatory fields)

      Message length (4 bytes)  Length of the SIP Payload in bytes

      Transaction ID (2 bytes)  

      Message Type (1 byte)     MT = 0 for Assist-REQ
                                MT = 1 for Assist-RSP
                                MT = 2 for LOC-REQ
                                MT = 3 for LOC-RSP

   The next set of elements within the XML depends on which of the 4 
   message types is being communicated.  One, and only one of the 
   following message types MUST appear as the next XML elements within 
   the same PIDF-LO.    

   (M) means an element is mandatory in the message type.
   (O) means the element is optional in the message type.

5.   XML Schema for A-GPS within PIDF-LO

   TBD


6.  Filters to ask for A-GPS within SUBSCRIBE

   TBD


7.  Known Open Issues

   This document is admittedly incomplete.  There are many fields and 
   definitions that are not expanded or explained.  Part of this is due
   to synchronizing this document with the WiMAX Forum's WiMAX Location
   Protocol (WLP), which is still be worked on. Part of this is due to 
   there not being enough time to complete this document.

   - does this extension to RFC 4119 necessitate extending the 
     <provided-by> element to include the URI of the LIS?


8.  Security considerations

   This document introduces no new security considerations from that in
   RFC 4119 [RFC4119].


9.  IANA considerations

   TBD

   (the modified PIDF-LO schema, the A-GPS filters, and the <method> 
    element will be listed here)
