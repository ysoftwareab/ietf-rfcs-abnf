Abstract

   The Platform for Privacy Preferences 1.0[4] (P3P1.0) specification
   describes how to associate a privacy policy with each URI request.
   Such associations are contained in a so-called policy reference
   file. This draft describes a new HTTP response header which
   indicates the location of such policy reference file. This header is
   intended to be a part of the P3P1.0 framework and should be treated
   in the full context of the P3P1.0 specification[4].

Internet-Draft         The HTTP header for P3P1.0          February 2002


1. Introduction

1.1 Background

   The Platform for Privacy Preferences 1.0[4] (P3P1.0, henceforth
   "P3P") is a specification currently under development at the World
   Wide Web Consortium (W3C)[8]. 

   P3P creates a framework for standardized, machine-readable privacy
   policies, and consumer products that read these policies. P3P's
   design allows Web sites to deliver automated privacy statements, and
   makes it possible for users' browsers to review the statements and
   to automate decision-making based on these practices when
   appropriate. 

   For more information on the P3P specification please consult the P3P
   specification document[4]. 

1.2 Motivation

   Locating a P3P policy reference file is one of the first steps in
   the operation of the P3P protocol. A P3P policy reference file
   associates to a URI or set of URIs the appropriate privacy policies.
   User agents (e.g., web browsers) can use policy references to
   automatically locate the privacy policy which applies to a page, so
   that they can process that policy for the benefit of their user. 

   The P3P HTTP header comes into play by providing the URI in which
   the policy reference file can be found. 

1.3 Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "MAY" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119[3].

2. The P3P HTTP header

   Any document retrieved by HTTP may point to a policy reference file
   through the use of the P3P HTTP response header, the "PolicyRef"
   header. 

   The PolicyRef header contains the URI of a policy reference file,
   which will usually state the P3P policy covering the document that
   pointed to the reference file, and possibly others as well. The URI
   specified in the PolicyRef header MUST NOT be used for any other
   purpose beyond identifying and referencing P3P policies. 

   The P3P policy reference header SHOULD be inserted whenever a
   P3P-enabled server responds to a relevant request, including when it
   responds to HEAD and OPTIONS requests. 

   Since policy references may be processed by agents anywhere along
   the response chain, the P3P header is an end-to-end HTTP extension. 

   The PolicyRef header can be safely ignored by those
   applications/agents that do not understand it.

3. Header Syntax

   The P3P header gives one or more comma-separated directives. The
   syntax follows, specified using ABNF rules (as per RFC2234[5]): 

   p3p-header       = `P3P: ` p3p-header-field *(`,` p3p-header-field)

   p3p-header-field = policy-ref-field | compact-policy-field | extension-field

   policy-ref-field = `policyref="` URI-reference `"`

   extension-field  = token [`=` (token | quoted-string) ]

   Here, URI-reference is defined as per RFC 2396[1], token and
   quoted-string are defined by HTTP1.1[6]. 

   In keeping with the rules for other HTTP headers, the P3P portion of
   this header may be written in any case. 

   The policyref directive gives a URI which specifies the location of
   the policy reference file which will state the P3P policy covering
   the document that pointed to the reference file, and possibly others
   as well. 

   The compact-policy-field is used to specify "compact policies". They
   are described in the next section. 

   User agents which find unrecognized directives (in the
   extension-fields) MUST ignore the unrecognized directives. This is
   to allow easier deployment of future versions of P3P. 

   For example: 

   1.  

       Client makes a GET request.

       GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
       Host: catalog.example.com
       Accept: */*
       Accept-Language: de, en
       User-Agent: WonderBrowser/5.2 (RT-11)

       Server returns content and the PolicyRef header pointing to the
       policy of the page. 

       HTTP/1.1 200 OK
       P3P: policyref="http://catalog.example.com/P3P/PolicyReferences.xml"
       Content-Type: text/html
       Content-Length: 7413
       Server: CC-Galaxy/1.3.18

4. Compact Policies

   Compact policies are essentially summaries of P3P policies. They can
   be used by user agents to quickly get approximate information about
   P3P policies, therefore improving performance. 

   For an in-depth explanation of compact policies, we refer to the
   P3P1.0[4] specification. Here, we limit to stating the syntax: 

   compact-policy-field  = `CP="` compact-policy `"`

   compact-policy        = compact-token *(" " compact-token)

   compact-token         = compact-access           |
                           compact-disputes         |
                           compact-remedies         |
                           compact-non-identifiable |
                           compact-purpose          |
                           compact-recipient        |
                           compact-retention        |
                           compact-categories       |
                           compact-test

   compact-access        = "NOI" | "ALL" | "CAO" | "IDC" | "OTI" | "NON"

   compact-disputes      = "DSP"

   compact-remedies      = "COR" | "MON" | "LAW"

   compact-non-identifiable = "NID"

   compact-purpose       = "CUR"        | "ADM" [creq] | "DEV" [creq] | "TAI" [creq] |
                           "PSA" [creq] | "PSD" [creq] | "IVA" [creq] | "IVD" [creq] |
                           "CON" [creq] | "HIS" [creq] | "TEL" [creq] | "OTP" [creq]

   creq                  = "a" | "i" | "o"

   compact-recipient     = "OUR" | "DEL" [creq] | "SAM" [creq] | "UNR" [creq] |
                           "PUB" [creq] | "OTR" [creq]

   compact-retention     = "NOR" | "STP" | "LEG" | "BUS" | "IND"

   compact-category      = "PHY" | "ONL" | "UNI" | "PUR" | "FIN" | "COM" |
                           "NAV" | "INT" | "DEM" | "CNT" | "STA" | "POL" |
                           "HEA" | "PRE" | "LOC" | "GOV" | "OTC"

   compact-test          = "TST"

5. Security Considerations

   There are no additional security requirements transporting the P3P
   header beyond the requirements of the document it is associated
   with.
