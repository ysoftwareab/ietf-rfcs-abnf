2.  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five
   major components:

    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and
        events for the purpose of management. The first
        version of this Structure of Management Information
        (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD 16, RFC
        1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The
        second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58,
        RFC 2578 [5], RFC 2579 [6] and RFC 2580 [7].

    o   Message protocols for transferring management
        information. The first version of the SNMP message
        protocol is called SNMPv1 and described in STD 15, RFC
        1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP message
        protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
        protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
        [9] and RFC 1906 [10]. The third version of the
        message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC
        1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and RFC 2574 [12].

    o   Protocol operations for accessing management
        information. The first set of protocol operations and
        associated PDU formats is described in STD 15, RFC
        1157 [8]. A second set of protocol operations and
        associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [13].

    o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC
        2573 [14] and the view-based access control mechanism
        described in RFC 2575 [15].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management
   Framework can be found in RFC 2570 [22].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information
   store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined
   in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the
   SMIv2. A MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced
   through the appropriate translations. The resulting
   translated MIB must be semantically equivalent, except
   where objects or events are omitted because no translation
   is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual
   descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation process.
   However, this loss of machine readable information is not
   considered to change the semantics of the MIB.

3.  Overview

This document continues the architecture created in the RMON
MIB [18] by providing analysis of application performance as
experienced by end-users.

Application performance measurement measures the quality of
service delivered to end-users by applications. With this
perspective, a true end-to-end view of the IT infrastrure
results, combining the performance of the application,
desktop, network, and server, as well as any positive or
negative interactions between these components.

Despite all the technically sophisticated ways in which
networking and system resources can be measured, human end-
users perceive only two things about an application:
availability and responsiveness.

   Availability - The percentage of the time that the
   application is ready to give a user service.

   Responsiveness - The speed at which the application
   delivers the requested service.

A transaction is an action initiated by a user that starts and
completes a distributed processing function. A transaction
begins when a user initiates a request for service (i.e.
pushing a submit button) and ends when the work is completed
(i.e. information is provided or a confirmation is delivered).
A transaction is the fundamental item measured by the APM MIB.

A failed transaction is a transaction that fails to provide
the service requested by the end user, regardless of whether
it is due to a processing failure or transport failure.

An application protocol (e.g. POP3) may implement different
commands or application "verbs" (e.g. POP3 Login and POP3
Retrieval). It will often be interesting to monitor these
verbs separately because:
  1) The verbs may have widely differing performance
characteristics
     (in fact some may be response time oriented while others
are
     throughput oriented)
  2) The verbs have varying business significance





Steven Waldbusser  Expires January 20, 2002           [Page 4]





Internet Draft              APM MIB              July 20, 2001


  3) It provides more granularity of exactly what might be
performing
     poorly

This MIB allows the measurement of a parent application, its
component verbs, or both. If monitoring both, one can watch
the top-level application and then drill down to the verbs
when trouble is spotted to learn which subcomponents are in
trouble. Each application verb is registered separately in the
Protocol Directory as a child of its parent application.

Application protocols implement one of three different types
of transactions: transaction-oriented, throughput-oriented, or
streaming-oriented. While the availability metric is the same
for all three types, the responsiveness metric varies:

   Transaction-Oriented: These transactions have a fairly
   constant workload to perform for all transactions. The
   responsiveness metric for transaction-oriented applications
   is application response time, the elapsed time between the
   user's request for service (e.g. pushing the submit button)
   and the completion of the request (e.g. displaying the
   results) and is measured in milliseconds. This is commonly
   referred to as end-user response time.

   Throughput-Oriented: These transactions have widely varying
   workloads based on the amount of data requested. The
   responsiveness metric for throughput-oriented applications
   is kilobits per second.

   Streaming-Oriented: These transactions deliver data at a
   constant metered rate of speed regardless of excess
   capacity in the networking and computing infrastructure.
   However, when the infrastructure's cannot deliver data at
   this speed, interruption of service or degradation of
   service can result. The responsiveness metric for
   streaming-oriented applications is the signal quality ratio
   of time that the service is degraded or interrupted to the
   total service time. This metric is measured in parts per
   million.

3.1.  Report Aggregation

This MIB provides functions to aggregate measurements into
higher level summaries.

Every transaction is identified by its application, server,
and client and has an availability measure as well as a
responsiveness measure. The appropriate responsiveness measure
is context-sensitive depending on whether the application is
transaction-oriented, throughput-oriented, or streaming-
oriented. For example, in a 5 minute period several
transactions might be recorded:

Application  Client  Server   Successful    Responsiveness
HTTP         Jim     Amazon   1             6 sec.
SAP/R3       Jane    SAP      1             17 sec.
HTTP         Joe     HR       0             -
FTP          Jim     ietf     1             47MspTb (212 Kbps)
HTTP         Joe     HR       1             25 sec.
RealVideo    Joe     CNN      1             100.0%
HTTP         Jane    HR       1             5 sec.

These transactions can be aggregated in several ways,
providing statistical summaries - for example summarizing all
HTTP transactions, or all HTTP transactions to the HR Server.
Note that data from different applications may not be
summarized because:

   1. The performance characteristics of different
   applications differ widely enough to render statistical
   analysis meaningless.

   2. The responsiveness metrics of different applications may
   be different, making a statistical analysis impossible (in
   other words, one application may be transaction-oriented,
   while another is throughput-oriented).

Aggregating transactions collected over a period requires an
aggregation algorithm. In this MIB, transaction aggregation
always results in the following statistics:

TransactionCount
    The total number of transactions during this period

SuccessfulTransactions





Steven Waldbusser  Expires January 20, 2002           [Page 6]





Internet Draft              APM MIB              July 20, 2001


    The total number of transactions that were successful. The
    management station can derive the percent success by dividing
    SuccessfulTransactions by the TransactionCount.

ResponsivenessMean
    The average of the responsiveness metric for all aggregated
    transactions that completed successfully

ResponsivenessMin
    The minimum responsiveness metric for all aggregated transactions
    that completed successfully

ResponsivenessMax
    The maximum responsiveness metric for all aggregated transactions
    that completed successfully

ResponsivenessBx
    The count of successful transactions whose responsiveness metric
    fell into the range specified for Bx. There are 7 buckets
    specified. Because the performance of different applications varies
    widely, the bucket ranges are specified separately for each
    application (in the apmAppDirectoryTable) so that they may be
    tuned to typical performance of each application.

For example, when aggregating the previous set of transactions
by application we get (for simplicity the example only shows
TransactionCount, SuccessfulTransactions, and
ResponsivenessMean):

Application  Count Successful      ResponsivenessMean
HTTP         4     3               12 sec.
SAP/R3       1     1               17 sec.
FTP          1     1               212 Kbps.
RealVideo    1     1               100.0%

There are four different types of aggregation.

   The flows(1) aggregation is the simplest. All transactions
   that share common application/server/client 3-tuples are
   aggregated together, resulting in a set of metrics for all
   such unique 3-tuples.

   The clients(2) aggregation results in somewhat more
   aggregation (i.e. fewer resulting records). All
   transactions that share common application/client tuples





Steven Waldbusser  Expires January 20, 2002           [Page 7]





Internet Draft              APM MIB              July 20, 2001


   are aggregated together, resulting in a set of metrics for
   all such unique tuples.

   The servers(3) aggregation usually results in still more
   aggregation (i.e. fewer resulting records). All
   transactions that share common application/server tuples
   are aggregated together, resulting in a set of metrics for
   all such unique tuples.

   The applications(4) aggregation results in the most
   aggregation (i.e. the fewest resulting records). All
   transactions that share a common application are aggregated
   together, resulting in a set of metrics for all such unique
   applications.

For example, if in a 5 minute period the following
transactions occurred:

Actual Transactions:
#   App      Client  Server   Successful    Responsiveness
1   HTTP     Jim     CallCtr  N             -
2   HTTP     Jim     HR       Y             12 sec.
3   HTTP     Jim     Amazon   Y             7 sec.
4   HTTP     Jim     CallCtr  Y             5 sec.
5   Email    Jim     Pop3     Y             12 sec.
6   HTTP     Jane    CallCtr  Y             3 sec.
7   SAP/R3   Jane    SAP      Y             19 sec.
8   Email    Jane    Pop3     Y             16 sec.
9   HTTP     Joe     HR       Y             18  sec.

The flows(1) aggregation results in the following table. Note that the
first record (HTTP/Jim/CallCtr) is the aggregation of transactions #1
and #4:

App     Client  Server    Count  Succe-  Rsp    Rsp   Rsp   RspB0  RspB1

The apmReportControlTable provides for a historical set of the
last 'X' reports, combining the historical records found in
history tables with the periodic snapshots found in TopN tables.
Conceptually the components are:

   APMReportControlTable
       Specifies data collection and summarization parameters, including
       the number of reports to keep and the size of each report.

   APMReport
       Each APM Report contains an aggregated list of records
       that represent data collected during a specific time period.

       An APMReportControlEntry causes a family of APM Reports to be
       created, where each report summarizes different, successive,
       contiguous periods of time.

       While the conceptual model of APM Reports shows them as distinct
       entities, they are all entries in a single apmReportTable, where
       entries in report 'A' are seperated from entries in report 'B'
       by different values of the apmReportIndex.

3.2.  Measurement Methodology

There are many different measurement methodologies available
for measuring application performance (e.g., probe-based,
client-based, synthetic-transaction, etc.). This specification
does not mandate a particular methodology - it is open to any
that meet the minimum requirements. Conformance to this
specification requires that the collected data match the
semantics described herein. In particular, a data collection
methodology must be able to measure response time, throughput,
streaming responsiveness and availability as specified.

Note that in some cases a transaction may run for a long time
but ultimately be successful. The measurement software
shouldn't prematurely classify lengthy transactions as
failures but should wait as long as the client application
will wait for a successful response.


3.3.  Structure of MIB

The objects are arranged into the following groups:

        - APM Application Directory Group

        - APM User Defined Applications Group

        - APM Report Group

        - APM Current Transaction Group

        - APM Exception Group

        - APM Notification Group

These groups are the basic unit of conformance.  If an agent
implements a group, then it must implement all objects in that
group. While this section provides an overview of grouping and
conformance information for this MIB, the authoritative
reference for such information is contained in the MODULE-
COMPLIANCE and OBJECT-GROUP macros later in this MIB.

These groups are defined to provide a means of assigning
object identifiers, and to provide a method for implementors
of managed agents to know which objects they must implement.

3.3.1.  The APM Application Directory Group

objects for every application or application verb monitored on
this system. This group consists of the apmAppDirectoryTable.

3.3.2.  The APM User Defined Applications Group

The APM User Defined Applications Group contains objects that
allow for the tracking of applications or application verbs
that aren't registered in the protocolDirectoryTable. This
group consist of the apmHttpFilterTable and the
apmUserDefinedAppTable.

3.3.3.  The APM Report Group

The APM Report Group is used to prepare regular reports that
aggregate application performance by flow, by client, by
server, or by application. This group consists of the
apmReportControlTable and the apmReportTable.

3.3.4.  The APM Current Transaction Group

The APM Current Transaction Group is used to show the
transactions that are currently in progress, along with their
responsiveness metric.

Because many transactions last a very short time, they will
exist in this table for a very short time. Thus, polling this
table is not an effective mechanism for retrieving all
transactions.

This table is designed to allow a management station to check
on the status of long-lived transactions. Because the
apmReport and apmException mechanisms act only on transactions
that have finished, a network manager may not have visibility
for some time into the performance of long-lived transactions
such as streaming applications, large data transfers, or
(very) poorly performing transactions. In fact, by their very
definition, the apmReport and apmException mechanisms only
provide visibility into a problem after nothing can be done
about it. The apmCurrentTransactionTable provides visibility
into transactions that are currently executing and will allow
a management station to find status of long-lived
transactions.

3.3.5.  The APM Exception Group

The APM Exception Group is used to generate immediate
notifications of transactions that cross certain thresholds.
The apmExceptionTable is used to configure which thresholds
are to be checked for which types of transactions. The
apmTransactionResponsivenessAlarm notification is sent when a
transaction occurs with a responsiveness that crosses a
threshold. The apmTransactionUnsuccessfulAlarm notification is
sent when a transaction fails for which exception checking was
configured.

3.3.6.  The APM Notification Group

The APM Notification Group contains 2 notifications that are
sent when thresholds in the APM Exception Table are exceeded.

        AppLocalIndex values assigned to entries in another
        table. Further, every protocolDirLocalIndex value registered
        by the agent automatically assigns the same value out of the
        AppLocalIndex number space.

        For example, if the protocolDirLocalIndex values { 1, 3, 5, 7 }
        have been assigned, and the apmHttpFilterLocalIndex values
        { 6, 8, 9 } have been assigned:

            - Assignment of new AppLocalIndex values must not use the
              values { 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 }.
            - AppLocalIndex values { 1, 3, 5, 7 } are automatically
              assigned and are associated with the identical value of
              protocolDirLocalIndex. In particular, an entry in the
              apmAppDirectoryTable indexed by a value provides further
              information about a protocol indexed by the same value
              in the protocolDirectoryTable of RMON2.

        The value for each supported application must remain constant
        at least from one re-initialization of the entity's network
        management system to the next re-initialization, except that
        if an application is deleted and re-created, it must be
        re-created with a new value that has not been used since the
        last re-initialization.

        The specific value is meaningful only within a given SNMP
        entity. An AppLocalIndex value must not be re-used until the
        next agent restart."

        There are 3 types of measurements for different types of
        applications:

        Transaction-Oriented applications have a fairly constant
        workload to perform for all transactions. The responsiveness
        metric for transaction-oriented applications is application
        response time (from first request to final delivery of

        service) and is measured in milliseconds. This is
        commonly referred to as end-user response time.

        Throughput-Oriented applications have widely varying workloads
        based on the nature of the client request. In particular,
        throughput-oriented applications vary widely in the amount of
        data that must be transported to satisfy the request. The
        responsiveness metric for throughput-oriented applications is
        kilobits per second.

        Streaming-Oriented applications deliver data at a constant
        metered rate of speed regardless of the responsiveness of the
        networking and computing infrastructure. This constant rate of
        speed is generally specified to be below (sometimes well
        below) the nominal capability of the infrastructure. However,
        when the infrastructure's cannot deliver data at this speed,
        interruption of service or degradation of service can
        result. The responsiveness metric for streaming-oriented
        applications is the ratio of time that the service is degraded
        or interrupted to the total service time. This metric is
        measured in parts per million.

        Note that for some applications, measuring more than one
        responsiveness type may be interesting. For agents that wish
        to support more than one measurement for a application, they
        will populate this table with 2 entries for that application,
        one for each type."

-- The APM User-Defined Application Table

-- Many application protocols will never be registered with a

-- because they are custom, in-house or proprietary

-- monitoring the end-user experience of these applications.

-- This read-only table provides a means for the agent to advertise

        aggregates are constant no matter which type of aggregation is
        being performed. These metrics may be found in the

        The flows(1) aggregation is the simplest. All transactions
        that share common application/server/client 3-tuples are
        aggregated together, resulting in a set of metrics for all
        such unique 3-tuples.

        The clients(2) aggregation results in somewhat more
        aggregation (i.e. fewer resulting records). All transactions
        that share common application/client tuples are aggregated
        together, resulting in a set of metrics for all such unique
        tuples.

        The servers(3) aggregation usually results in still more
        aggregation (i.e. fewer resulting records). All transactions
        that share common application/server tuples are aggregated
        together, resulting in a set of metrics for all such unique
        tuples.

        The applications(4) aggregation results in the most
        aggregation (i.e. the fewest resulting records). All
        transactions that share a common application are aggregated
        together, resulting in a set of metrics for all such unique
        applications.

        Note that it is not meaningful to aggregate applications, as
        different applications have widely varying characteristics. As a

    UNITS      "seconds"
    MAX-ACCESS read-write
    STATUS     current
    DESCRIPTION
        "Because the responsiveness for throughput-oriented
        transactions is divided by the elapsed time, it can be very
        sensitive to short-term performance variations for
        transactions that take a short period of time. For example,
        when downloading a very short file, a single dropped packet
        could double or triple the total response time.

        Further, for very short transactions, the fixed transaction
        costs (handshake, setup time, authentication, round-trip time)
        may dominate the total response time for the transaction.

        This object controls the minimum number of seconds that an
        throughput-based transaction must exceed before an exception
        can be generated for it. If this object is set to zero, then
        all throughput-based transactions are candidates for
        exceptions."

5.  Security Considerations

This MIB contains network addresses, application usage
information, and conversation statistics. Data of this nature
may be considered sensitive in some environments. In such
environments the administrator may wish to restrict SNMP
access to the agent.

There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB
that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-
create.  Such objects may be considered sensitive or
vulnerable in some network environments.  The support for SET
operations in a non-secure environment without proper
protection can have a negative effect on network operations.

SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the
network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even
then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the
objects in this MIB.

It is recommended that the implementors consider the security
features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically,
the use of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [12] and the
View-based Access Control Model RFC 2575 [15] is recommended.

It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the
SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is
properly configured to give access to the objects only to
those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed
GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
