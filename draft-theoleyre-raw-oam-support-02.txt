   Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM) features for RAW
                   draft-theoleyre-raw-oam-support-02

Abstract

   Some critical applications may use a wireless infrastructure.
   However, wireless networks exhibit a bandiwidth of several orders of
   magnitude lower than wired networks.  Besides, wireless transmissions
   are lossy by nature; the probability that a packet cannot be decoded
   correctly by the receiver may be quite high.  In these conditions,
   guaranteeing the network infrastructure works properly is
   particularly challenging, since we need to address some issues
   specific to wireless networks.  This document lists the requirements
   of the Operation, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) features
   recommended to construct a predictable communication infrastructure
   on top of a collection of wireless segments.  This document describes
   the benefits, problems, and trade-offs for using OAM in wireless
   networks to achieve Service Level Objectives (SLO).

1.  Introduction

   Reliable and Available Wireless (RAW) is an effort that extends
   DetNet to approach end-to-end deterministic performances over a
   network that includes scheduled wireless segments.  In wired
   networks, many approaches to Quality of Service (QoS) tried to
   implement traffic differentiation so that routers handle differently
   each type of packets.  However, this differentiated treatment was
   expensive for most applications.

   Deterministic Networking (DetNet) [RFC8655] has proposed to provide a
   bounded end-to-end latency on top of the network infrastructure,
   comprising both Layer 2 bridged and Layer 3 routed segments.  Their
   work encompasses the data plane, OAM, time synchronization,
   management, control, and security aspects.

   However, wireless networks create specific challenges.  First of all,
   radio bandwdidth is significantly lower than for wired networks.  In
   these conditions, the volume of signaling messages has to be very
   limited.  Even worse, wireless links are lossy: a layer 2
   transmission may or may not be decoded correctly by the receiver,
   depending on a large set of parameters.  Thus, providing high
   reliability through only wireless segments only is particularly
   challenging.

   Last but not least, radio links present very unstable
   characteristics.  If the wireless networks use an unlicensed band,
   packet losses are not anymore temporally and spatially independent.
   Typically, links may exhibit a very bursty characteristic, where
   several consecutive packets may be dropped.  Thus, providing
   availability and reliability on top of the wireless infrastructure
   requires specific layer 3 mechanisms to counteract these bursty
   losses.

   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) Tools are of
   primary importance for IP networks [RFC7276].  It defines a toolset
   for fault detection and isolation, and for performance measurement.

   The main purpose of this document is to detail the specific
   requirements of the OAM features recommended to construct a
   predictable communication infrastructure on top of a collection of
   wireless segments.  This document describes the benefits, problems,
   and trade-offs for using OAM in wireless networks to provide
   availability and predictability.

   In this document, the term OAM will be used according to its
   definition specified in [RFC6291].  We expect to implement an OAM
   framework in RAW networks to maintain a real-time view of the network

   infrastructure, and its ability to respect the Service Level
   Objectives (SLO), such as delay and reliability, assigned to each
   data flow.

1.1.  Terminology

   o  OAM entity: a data flow to be controlled;

   o  Maintenance End Point (MEP): OAM devices crossed when entering/
      exiting the network.  In RAW, it corresponds mostly to the source
      or destination of a data flow.  OAM message can be exchanges
      between two MEPs;

   o  Maintenance Intermediate end Point (MIP): OAM devices along the
      flow; OAM messages can be exchanged between a MEP and a MIP;

   o  Defect: a temporary change in the network (e.g. a radio link which
      is broken due to a mobile obstacle);

   o  Fault: a definite change which may affect the network performance,
      e.g. a node runs out of energy.

2.  Role of OAM in RAW

   RAW networks expect to make the communications reliable and
   predictable on top of a wireless network infrastructure.  Most
   critical applications will define an SLO to be required for the data
   flows it generates.  RAW considers network plane protocol elements
   such as OAM to improve the RAW operation at the service and the
   forwarding sub-layers.

   To respect strict guarantees, RAW relies on an orchestrator able to
   monitor and maintain the network.  Typically, a Software Defined
   Network (SDN) controller is in charge of scheduling the transmissions
   in the deployed network, based on the radio link characteristics, SLO
   of the flows, the number of packets to forward.  Thus, resources have
   to be provisioned a priori to handle any defect.  OAM represents the
   core of the over provisioning process, and maintains the network
   operational by updating the schedule dynamically.

   Fault-tolerance also assumes that multiple paths have to be
   provisioned so that an end-to-end circuit keeps on existing whatever
   the conditions.  The replication/elimination processes (PREOF) on a
   node is typically controlled by the central controller/orchestrator.
   OAM is in charge of controlling that PREOF is working properly on a
   node and within the domain.

   To be energy-efficient, reserving some dedicated out-of-band
   resources for OAM seems idealistic, and only in-band solutions are
   considered here.

   RAW supports both proactive and on-demand troubleshooting.

3.  Operation

   OAM features will enable RAW with robust operation both for
   forwarding and routing purposes.

3.1.  Information Collection

   Several solutions (e.g., Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP),
   YANG-based data models) are already in charge of collecting the
   statistics.  That way, we can encapsulate these statistics in
   specific monitoring packets, to send them to the controller.

3.2.  Continuity Check

   We need to verify that two endpoints are connected.  In other words,
   there exists "one" way to deliver the packets between two endpoints A
   and B.

Internet-Draft            OAM features for RAW                April 2020


3.3.  Connectivity Verification

   Additionally, to the Continuity Check, we have to verify the
   connectivity.  This verification considers additional constraints,
   i.e., the absence of misconnection.

   In particular, the resources have to be reserved by a given flow, and
   no packets from other flows steal the corresponding resources.
   Similarly, the destination does not receive packets from different
   flows through its interface.

   It is worth noting that the control and data packets may not follow
   the same path, and the connectivity verification has to be conducted
   in-band without impacting the data traffic.  Test packets must share
   the fate with the monitored data traffic without introducing
   congestion in normal network conditions.

3.4.  Route Tracing

   Ping and traceroute are two very common tools for diagnostic.  They
   help to identify a subset of the list of routers in the route.
   However, to be predictable, resources are reserved per flow in RAW.
   Thus, we need to define route tracing tools able to track the route
   for a specific flow.

   Wireless networks are meshed by nature: we have many redundant radio
   links.  These meshed networks are both an asset and a drawback: while
   several paths exist between two endpoints, we should choose the most
   efficient one(s), concerning specifically the reliability, and the
   delay.

   Thus, multipath routing can be considered to make the network fault-
   tolerant.  Even better, we can exploit the broadcast nature of
   wireless networks to exploit meshed multipath routing: we may have
   multiple Maintenance Intermediate Endpoints for each hop in the path.
   In that way, each Maintenance Intermediate Endpoint has several
   possible next hops in the forwarding plane.  Thus, all the possible
   paths between two maintenance endpoints should be retrieved.

3.5.  Fault Verification/detection

   RAW expects to operate fault-tolerant networks.  Thus, we need
   mechanisms able to detect faults, before they impact the network
   performance.

   The network has to detect when a fault occurred, i.e., the network
   has deviated from its expected behavior.  While the network must
   report an alarm, the cause may not be identified precisely.  For

   instance, the end-to-end reliability has decreased significantly, or
   a buffer overflow occurs.

3.6.  Fault Isolation/identification

   The network has isolated and identified the cause of the fault.  For
   instance, the quality of a specific link has decreased, requiring
   more retransmissions, or the level of external interference has
   locally increased.

4.  Administration

   The network has to expose a collection of metrics to support an
   operator making proper decisions, including:

   o  Packet losses: the time-window average and maximum values of the
      number of packet losses have to be measured.  Many critical
      applications stop to work if a few consecutive packets are
      dropped;

   o  Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) is a very common metric
      in wireless to denote the link quality.  The radio chipset is in
      charge of translating a received signal strength into a normalized
      quality indicator;

   o  Delay: the time elapsed between a packet generation / enqueuing
      and its reception by the next hop;

   o  Buffer occupancy: the number of packets present in the buffer, for
      each of the existing flows.

   These metrics should be collected:

   o  per virtual circuit to measure the end-to-end performance for a
      given flow.  Each of the paths has to be isolated in multipath
      routing strategies;

   o  per radio channel to measure, e.g., the level of external
      interference, and to be able to apply counter-measures (e.g.
      blacklisting)

   o  per device to detect misbehaving node, when it relays the packets
      of several flows.

4.1.  Collection of metrics

   We have to minimize the number of statistics / measurements to
   exchange:

   o  energy efficiency: low-power devices have to limit the volume of
      monitoring information since every bit consumes energy.

   o  bandwidth: wireless networks exhibit a bandwidth significantly
      lower than wired, best-effort networks.

   o  per-packet cost: it is often more expensive to send several
      packets instead of combining them in a single link-layer frame.

   Thus, localized and centralized mechanisms have to be combined
   together, and additional control packets have to be triggered only
   after a fault detection.

4.2.  Worst-case metrics

   RAW aims to enable real-time communications on top of a heterogeneous
   architecture.  Since wireless networks are known to be lossy, RAW has
   to implement strategies to improve reliability on top of unreliable
   links.  Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) has typically to enable
   retransmissions based on the end-to-end reliability and latency
   requirements.

   To make correct decisions, the controller needs to know the
   distribution of packet losses for each flow, and each hop of the
   paths.  In other words, the average end-to-end statistics are not
   enough.  They must allow the controller to predict the worst-case.

4.3.  Energy efficiency constraint

   RAW targets also low-power wireless networks, where energy represents
   a key constraint.  Thus, we have to take care of power and bandwidth
   consumption.  The following techniques aim to reduce the cost of such
   maintenance:

      piggybacking: some control information are inserted in the data
      packets if they do not fragment the packet (i.e., the MTU is not
      exceeded).  Information Elements represent a standardized way to
      handle such information;

      flags/fields: we have to set-up flags in the packets to monitor to
      be able to monitor the forwarding process accurately.  A sequence
      number field may help to detect packet losses.  Similarly, path
      inference tools such as [ipath] insert additional information in

      the headers to identify the path followed by a packet a
      posteriori.

5.  Maintenance

   RAW needs to implement a self-healing and self-optimization approach.
   The network must continuously retrieve the state of the network, to
   judge about the relevance of a reconfiguration, quantifying:

      the cost of the sub-optimality: resources may not be used
      optimally (e.g., a better path exists);

      the reconfiguration cost: the controller needs to trigger some
      reconfigurations.  For this transient period, resources may be
      twice reserved, and control packets have to be transmitted.

   Thus, reconfiguration may only be triggered if the gain is
   significant.

5.1.  Multipath Routing

   To be fault-tolerant, several paths can be reserved between two
   maintenance endpoints.  They must be node-disjoint so that a path can
   be available at any time.

5.2.  Replication / Elimination

   When multiple paths are reserved between two maintenance endpoints,
   they may decide to replicate the packets to introduce redundancy, and
   thus to alleviate transmission errors and collisions.  For instance,
   in Figure 1, the source node S is transmitting the packet to both
   parents, nodes A and B.  Each maintenance endpoint will decide to
   trigger the replication/elimination process when a set of metrics
   passes through a threshold value.


                          ===> (A) => (C) => (E) ===
                        //        \\//   \\//       \\
              source (S)          //\\   //\\         (R) (root)
                        \\       //  \\ //  \\      //
                          ===> (B) => (D) => (F) ===


   Figure 1: Packet Replication: S transmits twice the same data packet,
                     to its DP (A) and to its AP (B).

5.3.  Resource Reservation

   Because the QoS criteria associated with a path may degrade, the
   network has to provision additional resources along the path.  We
   need to provide mechanisms to patch a schedule (changing the channel
   offset, allocating more timeslots, changing the path, etc.).

5.4.  Soft transition after reconfiguration

   Since RAW expects to support real-time flows, we have to support
   soft-reconfiguration, where the novel resources are reserved before
   the ancient ones are released.  Some mechanisms have to be proposed
   so that packets are forwarded through the novel track only when the
   resources are ready to be used, while maintaining the global state
   consistent (no packet reordering, duplication, etc.)
