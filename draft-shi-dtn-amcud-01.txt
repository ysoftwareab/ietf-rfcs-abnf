Abstract

   This document proposes a coping mechanism used to deal with the
   unpredictable disruption problem in Space Delay Tolerant Networks
   (DTN) [RFC4838]. Since Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP)
   [RFC5326] provides retransmission-based reliability for bundles,
   several times of retransmissions can be seen as a failure occurred
   over links. The proposed mechanism is used to direct the following
   packets to other nodes and probes the availability of the links
   which has disrupted unexpectedly.

1. Introduction

   Since the moving trajectory of nodes is scheduled in the space
   network, it's possible to have a prior knowledge of contact
   information between any nodes. Consequently, routing algorithms such
   as Contact Graph Routing (CGR) [CGR] can calculate a delivery path
   from the source to destination hop by hop based on the connectivity
   relationship, propagation delay, data rate, etc.

   However, due to the complexity of the space network, the satellite
   and its associated links suffer from the electromagnetic

   interference frequently and this may lead to unpredictable
   disruption for a period of time. Then, the subsequent bundles cannot
   be transmitted successfully by the initial contact information, and
   retransmission is occurred. As a result, not only the timeliness of
   bundles cannot be guaranteed but also limited resources of the node
   and link are consumed and wasted. Thus, it is important to make a
   mechanism to handle the unexpected disruption problem.

   This draft proposes a coping mechanism to deal with such situations.
   It works with Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP) [RFC5326] and
   routing algorithms such as Contact Graph Routing (CGR), and it is
   used to not only direct the following bundles to other nodes when
   the disruption is occurred but also probe the availability of the
   disrupted links during the contact window.

2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3. The coping mechanism

   Since LTP provides retransmission-based reliability for bundles,
   several times of retransmissions can be seen as a failure occurred
   over links. Suppose CGR is used as the routing algorithm. Once the
   retransmission is detected for more than two times, the contact used
   in CGR is regarded as temporary corruption. Then, the node marks
   this contact as temporary disrupted and recalculates the route for
   subsequent bundles. Besides, a disruption advertisement for the
   unavailable contact is sent to upstream nodes. When receiving the
   advertisement, related nodes create disrupting contacts to prevent
   the use of disrupted links indicated by the advertisement. However,
   the advertisement may be useless when it arrives at some nodes whose
   related contacts do not become available until the expiration of the
   advertisement. Hence, a disruption advertisement group is defined to
   assure the effectiveness of the contact disruption advertisement.
   The group contains nodes indicated in corresponding contacts whose
   "from time" are earlier than the disrupting contact's "to time".

   When T seconds elapse, a probing message is sent by the node to the
   destination shown in the disputed contact to check if the
   connectivity has been recovered. The time T can be either a fixed
   value or a dynamic one estimated by the node based on some
   algorithms. If the corresponding response message is received, the  
   contact is remarked as "recovery" and can be used for the following
   bundles and a contact recovery advertisement is sent to nodes

   belonging to the advertisement group. Otherwise, the node sends a
   probe message again T seconds later. In this way, the node probes
   the disrupted link periodically until the contact is recovered or
   expired.

            Fig. 1 Example of unexpected contact disruption.

   An example is given to explain the contact disruption handling
   mechanism. Assume that the contact between Satellite1 and Satellite2
   is available from 1s to 300s, the contact between Stallite1 and
   Satellite3 from 100s to 300s, the contact between Satellite3 and
   Satellite4 from 100s to 300s, the contact between Satellite2 and
   Satellite4 from 1s to 300s, the contact between Satellite2 and
   Satellite3 from 1s to 300s, the contact between Satellite4 and
   Satellite 5 from 400s to 500s. Either Satellite2 or Satellite3 can
   be used by Satellite1 as relays to send bundles to Satellite5. At
   initial, Satellite2 is selected to be used.  Suppose at one time,
   the link from Satellite2 to Satellite4 is disrupted. When Satellite2
   detects the retransmission of bundles two times, it marks the
   contact to Satellite4 as "temporary disrupted" and recalculates
   routes for the subsequent bundles. Thus, those bundles will be sent
   to Satellite3 and then to Satellite4 and Satellite5. In addition,
   the disruption advertisement group is computed by Satellite2
   containing Satellite1, Satellite3 and Satellite4. When Satellite1

   receives the advertisement, it will mark the contact from Satellite2
   to Satellite4 as "disrupted" and use Satellite3 as the relay.

   At the same time, Satellite2 will send the probe message to
   Satellite4 periodically and check if the link is recovered. If
   Satellite2 receives a response, it will mark the contact as
   "recovery" and send contact recovery advertisement to satellites
   included in the advertisement group. If Satellite2 does not receive
   a response after sending the probing messages, it will resend the
   probing message again after T seconds until the disrupted contact is
   expired.
