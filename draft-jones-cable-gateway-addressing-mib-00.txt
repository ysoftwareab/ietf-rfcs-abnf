Abstract
 
   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it defines a basic set of managed objects for SNMP-
   based management of Network Address Translation and transparent
   bridging functionality within CableHome 1.0 and 1.1 compliant
   residential gateways.

   This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is compliant to the
   SNMP SMIv2 [5][6][7].  The set of objects is consistent with 
   the SNMP framework and existing SNMP standards.

1.  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

   o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1].

   o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
       purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
       Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD
       16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4].  The
       second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578
       [5], STD 58, RFC 2579 [6] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [7].

   o   Message protocols for transferring management information. The
       first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
       described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP
       message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
       protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC
       1906 [10].  The third version of the message protocol is called
       SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and RFC 2574
       [12].

   o   Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
       first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
       described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol
       operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
       [13].

   o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14] and
       the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575
       [15].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

Internet Draft      Cable Gateway Address Mapping MIB      October 2002   

   
   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.
   A MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

2.  Glossary

   The terms in this document are derived either from normal cable
   system usage, from normal residential gateway operation, or from 
   the documents associated with the CableHome 1.0 Specifications.

2.1 CATV

   Originally "Community Antenna Television", now used to refer to any
   cable or hybrid fiber and cable system used to deliver video signals
   to a community.
   
2.2 Cable Gateway Device

   A cable gateway device passes data traffic between the cable
   operator's broadband data network (the Wide Area Network, WAN) and
   the Local Area Network (LAN) in the cable data service subscriber's
   residence or business. In addition to passing traffic between the 
   WAN and LAN, the cable gateway device provides several services
   including a DHCP client and a DHCP server [RFC2131], a TFTP server
   [RFC1350], management services as enabled by SNMPv1/v2c/v3 agent 
   compliant with the RFCs listed in Section 1, and security services
   including stateful packet inspection firewall functionality and 
   software code image verification using techniques.
    
2.3 Portal Services

   A logical element aggregating the set of CableHome-specified 
   functionality in a CableHome compliant cable gateway device.

2.4 CAP

   CableHome Address Portal - The logical function within the Cable
   Gateway Device which provides the NAT/NAPT routing and 
   transparent bridging functions.

3.  Overview

   This MIB provides a set of objects required for the management of
   CAP NAT/NAPT and transparent bridging functions within CableHome
   compliant Residential Gateways (RG).  The MIB is derived from the
   CableHome 1.0 & 1.1 Specifications [XXX].   

   Depending on the configuration of the CAP, a CableHome RG will
   perform either standard NAT Network Address Translation or NAPT
   Network Address Port Translation.  It is also possible to 
   configure the CableHome RG to provide only NAT/NAPT functions,
   transparent bridging functions, or a combination of the two.

   The NAT/NAPT function of the CableHome RG generally translates
   traffic to and from privately addressed devices in the home 
   network to one (NAPT) or more (NAT) public addresses that are
   provisioned into the RG for this purpose.
   
   In order for the CableHome RG to support devices and applications
   that are NAT/NAPT intolerant, the RG also supports a type of
   transparent bridging, which we call Passthrough, by configuring
   the RG to bridge traffic for all devices on the home network or
   to bridge traffic to and from particular hardware addresses on
   the home network.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in [16].

3.1.  Structure of the MIB

   This MIB is structured into two groups:

	The cabhCapBase group provides a mechanism to define the 
	inactivity timeouts for TCP, UDP, and ICMP traffic types.
	It also provides a mechanism to set the Primary Packet-handling
	Mode of the RG - either	NAT, NAPT, or Passthrough.  Finally,
	this group provides a means to reset most MIB values defined
	in this MIB to their factory defaults.
	
	The cabhCapMap group contains information pertaining to the
	NAT/NAPT routing and transparent bridging (Passthrough) 
	functions of the RG.  The cabhCapMap group consists of two
	tables:
	
             -    cabhCapMappingTable: Allows for creating and
             		monitoring static and dynamic NAT and NAPT
             		mappings.

Internet Draft      Cable Gateway Address Mapping MIB      October 2002


             -    cabhCapPassthroughTable: Allows for configuring the
             		RG to transparently bridge traffic based on
             		hardware addresses of devices on the home
             		network.


3.2 Management requirements

   In addition to the explicit requirements in this specification,
   the Cable Gateway MUST support all applicable CableHome and IETF
   requirements and MIB objects.

7. Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB
   that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.
   Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some
   network environments.  The support for SET operations in a
   non-secure environment without proper protection can have a
   negative effect on network operations.

   It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects
   and possibly to even encrypt the values of these object when
   sending them over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of
   SNMP provide features for such a secure environment.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.


8.  Intellectual Property

   The IETF takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any
   intellectual property or other rights that might be claimed to
