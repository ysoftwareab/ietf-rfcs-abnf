      Using a DNS SRV Record to Locate an X.509 Certificate Store
                         draft-bhjl-x509-srv-03

Abstract

   This document describes a method to allow parties to locate X.509
   certificate stores with Domain Name System Service records in order
   to retrieve certificates and certificate revocation lists.  The
   primary purpose of such retrievals is to facilitate the association
   of X.509 and PGP public keys with e-mail addresses to allow for
   encrypted e-mail exchanges.

1.  Introduction

   X.509 and PGP public keys can be used to encrypt or sign e-mail
   messages.  In order to verify a sender's signature or encrypt an
   e-mail, the e-mail client needs to locate the appropriate public key.
   The X.509-based Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) [RFC5280] provides
   the necessary services to allow for the retrieval of certificates and
   certificate revocation lists, but lacks the discovery mechanism
   needed to associate e-mail domains with specific PKI servers.

   This document specifies an approach that uses a Domain Name System
   (DNS) Service Record (SRV) that allows mail service providers to
   advertise the X.509 or PGP certificate store [RFC4387] that contains
   certificates and certificate revocation lists for their e-mail users.
   Additionally, this document specifies the appropriate query strings
   to use when accessing the certificate store.

   The capitalized key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
   "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

2.  Service Record Format

   The general format of a DNS SRV record is documented in [RFC2782] as:


        _Service._Proto.Name TTL Class SRV Priority Weight Port Target

Internet-Draft            Cert Store SRV Record             January 2017


   To support the advertisement of an X.509 certificate store, service
   providers publish an SRV record for the certificates service with the
   appropriate parameters, as described in [RFC4387], section 3.2.  An
   example of such an SRV record is:


        _certificates._tcp 86400 IN SRV 0 0 443 certs.example.com


   The parameters of the DNS SRV record are set based on the operational
   needs of the service provider.  The DNS SRV record SHOULD be signed
   via DNSSEC [RFC4033][RFC4034].  The server MUST be an https server
   and will typically use port 443.  The certificate of the https server
   SHOULD be validated by a DNSSEC signed TLSA record, and MAY also be
   validated by a certificate authority.

3.  Certificate Store Queries

   To retrieve an X.509 S/MIME certificate, the attribute type is "uri",
   and the URI is constructed using the path described in [RFC4387],
   Section 3.3, specifically "/certificates/search.cgi".  Using the SRV
   record above to look up a certificate for bob@example.com, the URI
   would be:


 https://certs.example.com/certificates/search.cgi?uri=bob%40example.com


   X.509 certificate stores MUST support the uri attribute and MAY
   support other attributes.

   To retrieve a PGP certificate, the attribute type is "email", and the
   URI is constructed using the path described in [RFC4387],
   Section 3.3, specifically "/pgpkeys/search.cgi".  Using the SRV
   record above to look up a certificate for bob@example.com, the URI
   would be:


   https://certs.example.com/pgpkeys/search.cgi?email=bob%40example.com


   PGP certificate stores MUST support the email attribute and MAY
   support other attributes.

4.  Name Matching

   SMTP [RFC5321] specifies that the local part of a mailbox is
   interpreted only by the mailbox domain itself.  This document does
   not update or modify that document.

   If a certificate store has no certificate with an e-mail address that
   matches the uri or email attribute in a retrieval request, but it
   does have a certificate with an e-mail address that the mailbox
   domain treats similarly to the requested address, the server MAY
   return that certificate.  The definition of what is sufficiently
   similar is a matter of local policy, but the intention is that a
   human correspondent would consider the same person or entity to
   receive mail at the two addresses.

5.  Certificate Validation

   The certificate is returned as a blob of binary data.  If multiple
   certificates are returned, the response is encoded as multipart/mixed
   as described in [RFC4387] section 2.

   X509 S/MIME certificates are validated by checking for a signature by
   a Certificate Authority (CA) that is acceptable to the validating
   party.  This specification defines an additional validation
   technique.  The domain MAY publish validation certificates using TLSA
   records at the name _smimeca._tcp.  The TLSA records MUST have PKIX-
   TA or DANE-TA usage[RFC7218].  A validation certificate published by
   a domain MUST NOT be used to validate certificates other than those
   with e-mail addresses in that domain.

   Since the relationship between a domain and its mailbox users is in
   general unknown to correspondents, a client applies a local policy to
   decide whether to use a S/MIME certificate validated only by a
   signing certificate published by the domain.

   PGP certificates are validated by the PGP web of trust.  A domain can
   endorse the certificates it publishes by signing them with a
   signature of postmaster@<domain>.  Since the relationship between a
   domain and its mailbox users is in general unknown to correspondents.
   a client applies a local policy to decide whether to use a PGP
   certificate retrieved from a certificate server.  This policy would
   typically be the same one used to decide whether to use a certificate
   retrieved from a traditional PGP key server.

6.  Certificate use and cacheing

   Clients SHOULD cache responses to queries as advised by http cache
   headers.  This includes both returned certificates, and 404 failures
   saying that an address (or other search key) has no certificate.

   S/MIME keys retrieved from the certificate store SHOULD NOT be used
   for validation of signatures on incoming mail without further
   validation of the certificate.  S/MIME signed mail includes a copy of
   the signing certificate which, if it can be validated, typically
   would be used instead.

7.  Security Considerations

   Certificate queries could be used to try to validate lists of e-mail
   addresses.  This is essentially the same problem that mail servers
   face with VRFY, EXPN, and RCPT TO probes, and the same
   countermeasures would apply, such as rate limiting, blacklisting
   abusive clients, and returning fake results for non-existent
   addresses.

   DNSSEC signatures on the SRV record and the https server certificate
   ensure that any keys retrieved by the technique described in this
   document are the ones published by the domain's management.  But
   since correspondents often do not know the relationship between a
   domain and its mailbox users, it would be imprudent to assume that
   such certificates are in fact ones issued to or used by mailbox
   recipients or to assume that mail encrypted using the certificates
   will be readable only by the intended recipient.

   A domain could publish man-in-the-middle certificates that allowed it
   to decode and read mail, and perhaps re-encrypt it using different
   certificates used by the recipients.  In some cases this would be
   entirely legitimate, e.g., a financial institution that is required
   to log all of its employees' correspondence.  In other cases, it
   could be intrusive or improper surveillance of the contents of users'
   mail.  Identifying or describing the relationship between a domain
   and its mail users is beyond the scope of this document.

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to update two entries in the Service Name and
   Transport Protocol Port Number Registry.
