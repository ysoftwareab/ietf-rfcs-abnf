Abstract
   
   This memo defines two MIB modules and corresponding MIB Object
   Definitions that describe how label switching controlled 
   Frame-Relay and ATM interfaces can be managed given the 
   interface stacking as defined in the MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB and 
   MPLS-TE-STD-MIB.

1. Introduction
   
   This memo defines how label switching controlled Frame-Relay
   [RFC3034] and ATM [RFC3035] interfaces can be realized given  
   the interface stacking as defined in the MPLS-LSR-STD [RFC3813] 
   and MPLS-TE-STD [RFC3812] MIBs.  This document also contains a
   MIB module that sparsely augments the MPLS-LSR-STD MIB's 
   mplsInterfaceConfTable in such a way as to identify which
   MPLS-type interfaces have LC-ATM or LC-FR capabilities.
   Comments should be made directly to the MPLS mailing list at
   mpls@uu.net.
   
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
   NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   RFC 2119, reference [RFC2119].


2. Terminology
   
   This document uses terminology from the document describing the
   MPLS architecture [RFC3031], as well as RFC3035 and RFC3034.  
   Specifically, the following terms will be used in this document.

   LC-FR   RFC3034 defines a label switching controlled Frame Relay 
           (LC-FR) interface a Frame-Relay interface controlled by the 
           label switching control component.  Packets traversing 
           such an interface carry labels in the DLCI field

   LC-ATM RFC3035 defines a label switching controlled ATM (LC-ATM) 
          interface as an ATM interface controlled by the label 
          switching control component.  When a packet traversing such 
          an interface is received, it is treated as a labeled packet.
          The packet's top label is inferred either from the contents 
          of the VCI field or the combined contents of the VPI and VCI 
          fields. Any two LDP peers which are connected via an LC-ATM
          interface will use LDP negotiations to determine which of 
          these cases is applicable to that interface. 
          Static configuration of labels is also possible.

    When LDP is used to distribute labels for use on label-controlled
    interfaces, label configuration information may be available in the

    MPLS-LDP-ATM-STD-MIB [RFC3815] when LC-ATM interfaces are used, or 
    the MPLS-LDP-FRAME-RELAY-STD-MIB [RFC3815] when LC-FR interfaces
    are used. Specifically, 

3. The SNMP Management Framework
   
   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

4. Interface Stacking of LC-ATM

   Since LC-ATM interfaces [RFC2863] can carry labeled MPLS 
   traffic, they too are considered MPLS subinterfaces with 
   ifType = mpls(166). They differ slightly in their capability
   from a packet-oriented MPLS interface in that they may
   carry ATM or Frame-Relay encapsulated traffic. It is
   thus beneficial to identify them as such. To identify 
   them as such, two tables are defined which extend the
   MPLS-LSR-STD MIB's mplsInterfaceTable (see section 6 for 
   LC-ATM or 7 for LC-FR).

5. MPLS Label Controlled ATM MIB Definitions

   The following MIB module imports from [RFC2514], 
   [RFC3811], [RFC3813].

10.   Security Considerations
   
   It is clear that these MIB modules are potentially useful for 
   monitoring of MPLS LSRs supporting LC-ATM and/or LC-FR.  These 
   MIB can also be used for configuration of certain objects, and 
   anything that can be configured can be incorrectly configured, 
   with potentially disastrous results.
   
   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o    the MplsLcAtmStdInterfaceConfTable and 
        mplsLcFrStdInterfaceConfTable collectively 
        contain objects which may be used to provision MPLS LC or 
        FR-enabled interfaces.  Unauthorized access to objects in 
        these tables, could result in disruption of traffic on the 
        network.  This is especially true if traffic has been 
        established over these interfaces.  The use of stronger 
        mechanisms such as SNMPv3 security should be considered 
        where possible.  Specifically,SNMPv3 VACM and USM MUST be 
        used with any v3 agent which implements this MIB module.  
        Administrators should consider whether read access to 
        these objects should be allowed, since read access may be 
        undesirable under certain circumstances.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o    the MplsLcAtmStdInterfaceConfTable and 
        mplsLcFrStdInterfaceConfTable collectively
        collectively show the LC-ATM and/or LC-FR interfaces,
        their associated configurations and their linkages to other
        MPLS-related configuration and/or performanc statistics. 
        Administrators not wishing to reveal this information should
        consider these objects sensitive/vulnerable and take 
        precautions so they are not revealed.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module, is properly configured to give access 
   to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.


11.  IANA Considerations

   As described in and as requested in the MPLS-TC-STD-MIB
   [RFC3811], MPLS related standards track MIB modules should be
   rooted under the mplsStdMIB subtree.  There are 2 MPLS MIB modules
   contained in this document, each of the following "IANA
   Considerations" subsections requests IANA for a new assignment under
   the mplsStdMIB subtree.  New assignments can only be made via a
   Standards Action as specified in [RFC2434].

11.1.  IANA Considerations for MPLS-LC-ATM-STD-MIB

   The IANA is requested to assign { mplsStdMIB 9 } to the

   MPLS-LC-ATM-STD-MIB module specified in this document.

11.2.  IANA Considerations for MPLS-LC-FR-STD-MIB

   The IANA is requested to assign { mplsStdMIB 10 } to the 
   MPLS-LC-FR-STD-MIB module specified in this document.
