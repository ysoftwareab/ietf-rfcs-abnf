           Considerations for defining a Transport Slice NBI
                   draft-contreras-teas-slice-nbi-02

Abstract

   The transport network is an essential component in the end-to-end
   delivery of services and, consequently, with the advent of network
   slicing it is necessary to understand what could be the way in which
   the transport network is consumed as a slice.  This document analyses
   the needs of potential transport slice customers (i.e., use cases) in
   order to identify the functionality required on the North Bound
   Interface (NBI) of a transport slice controller for satisfying such
   transport slice requests.

1.  Introduction

   A number of new technologies, such as 5G, NFV and SDN are not only
   evolving the network from a pure technological perspective but also
   are changing the concept in which new services are offered to the
   customers [I-D.homma-slice-provision-models] by introducing the
   concept of network slicing.

   The transport network is an essential component in the end-to-end
   delivery of services and, consequently, it is necessary to understand
   what could be the way in which the transport network is consumed as a
   slice.  For a definition of transport slice refer to
   [I-D.nsdt-teas-transport-slice-definition].

   In this document it is assumed that there exists a (logically)
   centralized component in the transport network, namely Transport
   Slice Controller (TSC) with the responsibilities on the control and
   management of the transport slices invoked for a given service, as
   requested by Transport Slice customers.

   This document analyses different use cases deriving the needs of
   potential transport slice customers in order to identify the
   functionality required on the North Bound Interface (NBI) of the TSC
   to be exposed towards such transport slice customers.  Solutions to
   construct the requested transport slices are out of scope of this
   document.

   This document addresses some of the discussions of the TEAS Slice
   Design Team.  However, it is not at this stage an official outcome of
   the Design Team.

2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Northbound interface for transport slices

   In a general manner, the transport network supports different kinds
   of services.  These services consume capabilities provided by the
   transport network for deploying end-to-end services, interconnecting
   network functions or applications spread across the network and
   providing connectivity toward the final users of these services.

   Under the slicing approach, a transport slice customer requests to a
   transport slice controller a slice with certain characteristics and
   parametrization.  Such request it is assumed here to be done through
   a NBI exposed by the TSC to the customer, as reflected in Fig. 1.

                   Figure 1: Transport slice NBI concept

   The functionality supported by the NBI depends on the requirements
   that the slice customer has to satisfy.  It is then important to
   understand the needs of the slice customers as well as the way of
   expressing them.

4.  Transport slice use cases

   Different use cases for slice customers can be identified, as
   described in the following sections.

4.1.  5G Services

   5G services natively rely on the concept of network slicing. 5G is
   expected to allow vertical customers to request slices in such a
   manner that the allocated resources and capabilities in the network
   appear as dedicated for them.

   In network slicing scenarios, a vertical customer requests a network
   operator to allocate a network slice instance (NSI) satisfying a
   particular set of service requirements.  The content/format of these
   requirements are highly dependent on the networking expertise and use
   cases of the customer under consideration.  To deal with this
   heterogeneity, it is fundamental for the network operator to define a
   a unified ability to interpret service requirements from different
   vertical customers, and to represent them in a common language, with

   the purposes of facilitating their translation/mapping into specific
   slicing-aware network configuration actions.  In this regard, model-
   based network slice descriptors built on the principles of
   reproducibility, reusability and customizability can be defined for
   this end.

   As a starting point for such a definition, GSMA developed the idea of
   having a universal blueprint that, being offered by network
   operators, can be used by any vertical customer to order the
   deployment of an NSI based on a specific set of service requirements.
   The result of this work has been the definition of a baseline network
   slice descriptor called Generic network Slice Template (GST).  The
   GST contains multiple attributes that can be used to characterize a
   network slice.  A Network Slice Type (NEST) describes the
   characteristics of a network slice by means of filling GST attributes
   with values based on specific service requirements.  Basically, a
   NEST is a filled-in version of a GST.  Different NESTs allow
   describing different types of network slices.  For slices based on
   standardized service types, e.g. eMBB, uRLLC and mIoT, the network
   operator may have a set of readymade, standardized NESTs (S-NESTs).
   For slices based on specific industry use cases, the network operator
   can define additional NESTs.

   Service requirements from a given vertical customer are mapped to a
   NEST, which provides a self-contained description of the network
   slice to be provisioned for that vertical customer.  According to
   this reasoning, the NEST can be used by the network operator as input
   to the NSI preparation phase, which is defined in [TS28.530]. 3GPP is
   working on the translation of the GST/NEST attributes into NSI
   related requirements, which are defined in the "ServiceProfile" data
   type from the Network Slice Information Object Class (IOC) in
   [TS28.541].  These requirements are used by the 3GPP Management
   System to allocate the NSI across all network domains, including
   transport network.  The transport slice defines the part of that NSI
   that is deployed across the transport network.

   Despite the translation is an on-going work in 3GPP it seems
   convenient to start looking at the GST attributes to understand what
   kind of parameters could be required for the transport slice NBI.

4.1.1.  Generic network Slice Template

   The structure of the GST is defined in [GSMA].  The template defines
   a total of 35 attributes.  For each of them, the following
   information is provided:

   o  Attribute definition, which provides a formal definition of what
      the attribute represents.



Contreras, et al.       Expires January 14, 2021                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft     Considerations Transport Slice NBI          July 2020


   o  Attribute parameters, including:

      *  Value, e.g. integer, float.

      *  Measurement unit, e.g. milliseconds, Gbps

      *  Example, which provides examples of values the parameter can
         take in different use cases.

      *  Tag, which allow describing the type of parameter, according to
         its semantics.  An attribute can be tagged as a
         characterization attribute or a scalability attribute.  If it
         is characterization attribute, it can be further tagged as a
         performance-related attribute, a functionality-related
         attribute or an operation-related attribute.

      *  Exposure, which allow describing how this attribute interact
         with the slice customer, either as an API or a KPI.

   o  Attribute presence, either mandatory, conditional or optional.

   Attributes from GST can be used by the network operator (slice
   controller) and a vertical customer (slice customer) to agree SLA.

   GST attributes are generic in the sense that they can be used to
   characterize different types of network slices.  Once those
   attributes become filled with specific values, it becomes a NEST
   which can be ordered by slice customers.

4.1.2.  Categorization of GST attributes

   Not all the GST attributes as defined in [GSMA] have impact in the
   transport network since some of them are specific to either the radio
   or the mobile core part.

   In the analysis performed in this document, the attributes have been
   categorized as:

   o  Directly impactive attributes, which are those that have direct
      impact on the definition of the transport slice, i.e., attributes
      that can be directly translated into requirements required to be
      satisfied by a transport slice.

   o  Indirectly impactive attributes, which are thise that impact in an
      indirect manner on the definition of the transport slice, i.e.,
      attributes that indirectly impose some requirements to a transport
      slice.

Internet-Draft     Considerations Transport Slice NBI          July 2020


   o  Non-impactive attributes, that are those which do not have impact
      on the transport slice at all.

   The following sections describe the attributes falling into the three
   categories.

4.1.2.1.  Attributes with direct impact on the transport slice
          definition

   The following attributes impose requirements in the transport slice

   o  Availability

   o  Deterministic communication

   o  Downlink throughput per network slice

   o  Energy efficiency

   o  Group communication support

   o  Isolation level

   o  Maximum supported packet size

   o  Mission critical support

   o  Performance monitoring

   o  Slice quality of service parameters

   o  Support for non-IP traffic

   o  Uplink throughput per network slice

   o  User data access (i.e., tunneling mechanisms)

4.1.2.2.  Attributes with indirect impact on the transport slice
          definition

   The following attributes indirectly impose requirements in the
   transport slice to support the end-to-end service.

   o  Area of service (i.e., the area where terminals can access a
      particular network slice)

   o  Delay tolerance (i.e., if the service can be delivered when the
      system has sufficient resources)

Internet-Draft     Considerations Transport Slice NBI          July 2020


   o  Downlink (maximum) throughput per UE

   o  Network functions owned by Network Slice Customer

   o  Maximum number of (concurrent) PDU sessions

   o  Performance prediction (i.e., capability to predict the network
      and service status)

   o  Root cause investigation

   o  Session and Service Continuity support

   o  Simultaneous use of the network slice

   o  Supported device velocity

   o  UE density

   o  Uplink (maximum) throughput per UE

   o  User management openness (i.e., capability to manage users'
      network services and corresponding requirements)

   o  Latency from (last) UPF to Application Server

4.1.2.3.  Attributes with no impact on the transport slice definition

   The following attributes do not impact the transport slice.

   o  Location based message delivery (not related to the geographical
      spread of the network slice itself but with the localized
      distribution of information)

   o  MMTel support, i.e. support of and Multimedia Telephony Service
      (MMTel)as well as IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) support.

   o  NB-IoT Support, i.e., support of NB-IoT in the RAN in the network
      slice.

   o  Maximum number of (simultaneous) UEs

   o  Positioning support

   o  Radio spectrum

   o  Synchronicity (among devices)

   o  V2X communication mode

   o  Network Slice Specific Authentication and Authorization (NSSAA)

4.1.3.  Provisioning procedures

   3GPP identifies in [TS28.531] a number of procedures for the
   provisioning of a network slice in general.  It can be assumed that
   similar procedures may also apply to a transport slice, facilitating
   a consistent management and control of end-to-end slices.

   The envisioned procedures are the following:

   o  Slice instance allocation: this procedure permits to create a new
      slice instance (or reuse an existing one).

   o  Slice instance de-allocation: this procedure decommissions a
      previously instantiated slice.

   o  Slice instance modification: this procedure permits the change in
      the characteristics of an existing slice instance.

   o  Get slice instance status: this procedure helps to retrieve run-
      time information on the status of a deployed slice instance.

   o  Retrieval of slice capabilities: this procedure assists on getting
      information about the capabilities (e.g. maximum latency
      supported).

   All these procedures fit in the operation of transport network
   slices.

4.2.  NFV-based services

   NFV technology allows the flexible and dynamic instantiation of
   virtualized network functions (and their composition into network
   services) on top of a distributed, cloud-enabled compute
   infrastructure.  This infrastructure can span across different points
   of presence in a carrier network.  By leveraging on transport network
   slicing, connectivity services established across geographically
   remote points of presence can be enriched by providing additional QoS
   guarantees with respect present state-of-the-art mechanisms, as
   conventional L2/L3 VPNs.

Internet-Draft     Considerations Transport Slice NBI          July 2020


4.2.1.  Connectivity attributes

   The connectivity services are expressed through a number of
   attributes as listed:

   o  Incoming and outgoing bandwidth: bandwidth required for the
      connectivity services (in Mbps).

   o  Qos metrics: set of metrics (e.g., cost, latency and delay
      variation) applicable to a specific connectivity service

   o  Directionality: indication if the traffic is unidirectional or
      bidirectional.

   o  MTU: value of the largest PDU to be transmitted in the
      connectivity service.

   o  Protection scheme: indication of the kind of protection to be
      performed (e.g., 1;1, 1+1, etc.)

   o  Connectivity mode: indication of the service is point-to-point of
      point-to-multipoint

   All those attributes will assist on the characterization of the
   connectivity slice to be deployed, and thus, are relevant for the
   definition of a transport slice supporting such connectivity.

4.2.2.  Provisioning procedures

   ETSI NFV defines the role of WAN Infrastructure Manager (WIM) as the
   component in charge of managing and controlling the connectivity
   external to the PoPs.  In [IFA032] a number of interfaces are
   identified to be exposed by the WIM for supporting the multi-site
   connectivity, thus representing the capabilities expected for a
   transport network slice, as well, in case of satisfying such
   connectivity needs by means of the slice concept.

   The interfaces considered are the following:

   o  Multi-Site Connectivity Service (MSCS) Management: this interface
      permits the creation, termination, update and query of MSCSs,
      including reservation.  It also enables subscription for
      notifications and information retrieval associated to the
      connectivity service.

   o  Capacity Management: this interface allows querying about the
      capacity (e.g. bandwidth), topology, and network edge points of

      the connectivity service, as well as about information of consumed
      and available capacity on the underlying network resources.

   o  Fault Management: this interface serves for the provision of
      alarms related to the MSCSs.

   o  Performance Management: this interface assists on the retrieval of
      performance information (measurement results collection and
      notifications) related to MSCSs.
