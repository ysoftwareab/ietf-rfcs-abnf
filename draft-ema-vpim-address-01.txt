      This document lists the various VPIM email addresses that are 
      currently in common use and defines several new address formats for 
      special case usage. 
       
       
      2.  Introduction 
       
      [VPIM2] does not place any restrictions on the email address format.  
      However, it does suggest to use a numeric LHS since many legacy 
      voice mail systems only use digits to identify mailboxes.  Further, 
      it suggests a structure to handle private, international and 
      extensions.  The private format has become deployed in most existing 
      VPIM v2 systems, further some systems will only accept messages from 
      addresses with a numeric LHS. 
       
      [VPIM3] does not describe addressing at all.  The LHS format is 
      left to the discretion of the mailbox owner.  However, it is 
      useful in some cases (like submission or tunneling) to specify a

      LHS format.  A format based on GSTN Addressing [GSTN] is 
      presented. 
       
       
      3. VPIM v2 Addressing 
        
      RFC 822 addresses are based on the domain name system.  This 
      naming system has two components: the local part, used for 
      username or mailbox identification; and the host part, used for 
      global machine identification. 
      The local part of the email address shall be a US-ASCII string 
      uniquely identifying a mailbox on a destination system.  For 
      voice messaging, the local part is a printable string containing 
      the mailbox ID of the originator or recipient.  While alpha 
      characters and long mailbox identifiers are permitted, most voice 
      mail networks rely on numeric mailbox identifiers to retain 
      compatibility with the limited 10 digit telephone keypad.  As a 
      result, many voice messaging systems may only be able to handle a 
      numeric local part.  The reception of alphanumeric local parts on 
      these systems may result in:  the address being mapped to some 
      locally unique (but confusing to the recipient) number, the 
      address being deleted (but still delivered), or in the worst case 
      the entire message being rejected.  Additionally, it may be 
      difficult to create messages on these systems with an 
      alphanumeric local part without complex key sequences or some 
      form of directory lookup. 
        
      In the absence of a global directory, specification of the local 
      part is expected to conform to international or private telephone 
      numbering plans.  It is likely that private numbering plans will 
      prevail and these are left for local definition.  However, it is 
      recommended that public telephone numbers be noted according to 
      the international numbering plan described in [E.164]. The 
      indication that the local part is a public telephone number is 
      given by a preceding `+' (the `+' would not be entered from a 
      telephone keypad, it is added by the system as a flag).  Since 
      the primary information in the numeric scheme is contained by the 
      digits, other character separators (e.g. `-') may be ignored 
      (i.e. to allow parsing of the numeric local mailbox) or may be 
      used to recognize distinct portions of the telephone number (e.g. 
      country code).  The specification of the local part of a VPIM 
      address can be split into the four groups described below: 
       
      1) mailbox number 
         - for use as a private numbering plan (any number of digits) 
         - e.g.  2722@lucent.com 
      2) mailbox number+extension 
         - for use as a private numbering plan with extensions 
           any number of digits, use of `+' as separator 
         - e.g.  2722+111@lucent.com 
      3) +international number 
         - for international telephone numbers conforming to E.164

     Internet Draft             VPIM Addressing          March 10, 2000 
      
           maximum of 15 digits 
         - e.g.  +16137637582@nortelnetworks.com 
      4) +international number+extension 
         - for international telephone numbers conforming to E.164 
           maximum of 15 digits, with an extension (e.g. behind a 
           PBX) that has a maximum of 15 digits.  
         - e.g.  +17035245550+230@ema.org 
       
      Deployed VPIM v2 systems typically support the first group, that is 
      mailbox number on the LHS.  Note that in many case the mailbox is 
      simply the local number (e.g., in North America the 10-digit NANP 
      number is used). 
       
       
      4.  VPIM v3 Addressing  
       
      VPIM Version 3 places no restrictions on the form of the Internet 
      address. VPIM Version 3 systems must be capable of receiving an 
      arbitrary email address and generating a reply to that address.  No 
      inferences about the structure of the local part (LHS) should be 
      necessary. 
       
      Recipients email addresses must be created in a form compatible with 
      the recipients system and consistent with the address entry 
      capabilities of a telephone user interface. 
       
       
      4.1.1  VPIM v3 Submission LHS  
       
      Limited capability voice mail machines may send messages by default 
      to an external message submission gateway.  These gateways will 
      convert the unresolved telephone number of the recipient into a 
      legitimate email address.  Messages requiring address resolution 
      must be sent to a submission system which will convert the submitted 
      address into the route-able email address.  
       
      Additionally, limited capability email systems may send messages to 
      a VPIM onramp system indicated on the RHS. The LHS would indicate 
      that the message is to be sent as a VPIM message to the telephone 
      number indicated. In this case, address and message translation is 
      performed by the gateway. 
       
      Telephone numbers sent in a VPIM Version 3 submission mode MUST be 
      sent in one of the following forms. 
       
      This is based on the format defined in [PSTN-ADDR]. 
       
      The VPIM address 
      For voice messages that are intended to be sent as VPIM messages the 
      service-selector element is defined to be  
       
            vpim-service-selector = "VPIM"

      For voice messages that are intended to be sent as a voice 
      outdialing at the destination system, the service-selector element 
      is defined to be

      4.1.3  The AMIS address 
       
      For voice messages that are intended to be sent as AMIS (Audio 
      Messaging Interchange Specification) voice mail messages, the 
      service-selector element is defined to be  
       
            amis-service-selector = "AMIS"

      Based on RFC2303, these are the resultant email addresses for the

      The vpim-email element is a specific version of pstn-email for VPIM 
      over the Internet e-mail transport system, where the service-

      In this case the mta-I-pstn will usually point to a device that will
