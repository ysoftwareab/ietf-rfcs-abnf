Abstract

   While the X.500 standards define many useful attribute types [1] and
   object classes [2], they do not define a person object class that
   meets the requirements found in today's Internet and Intranet
   directory service deployments.  We define a new object class called
   inetOrgPerson that extends the X.521 standard organizationalPerson
   class to meet these needs.

Background and Intended Usage

   The inetOrgPerson object class is a general purpose object class that
   holds attributes about people.  The attributes it holds were chosen

INTERNET-DRAFT       The inetOrgPerson Object Class     24 November 1996


   to accommodate information requirements found in typical Internet and
   Intranet directory service deployments.  The inetOrgPerson object
   class is designed to be used within directory services based on LDAP
   [3] and the X.500 [4] family of protocols, and it should be useful in
   other contexts as well.

   The attributes that are used but not defined is this document are
   included in the LDAPv3 Standard and Pilot Attribute Definitions [5].
   The notation used in this document is also the same as that used in
   [5].

New Attribute Types Used in the inetOrgPerson Object Class

   ( 2.16.840.1.113730.3.1.1
       NAME 'carLicense'
       DESC 'automobile license plate number'
       EQUALITY caseIgnoreMatch
       SUBSTRINGS caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch
       SYNTAX 'DirectoryString'
   )

   ( 2.16.840.1.113730.3.1.2
       NAME 'departmentNumber'
       DESC 'numerically identifies a department within an organization'
       EQUALITY caseIgnoreMatch
       SUBSTRINGS caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch
       SYNTAX 'DirectoryString'
   )

   ( 2.16.840.1.113730.3.1.3

Definition of the inetOrgPerson Object Class

   ( 2.16.840.1.113730.3.2.2
       NAME 'inetOrgPerson'
       SUP organizationalPerson
       STRUCTURAL
       MAY (
           audio $ businessCategory $ carLicense $ departmentNumber $
           employeeNumber $ employeeType $ givenName $ homePhone $
           homePostalAddress $ initials $ jpegPhoto $ labeledURI $
           mail $ manager $ mobile $ pager $
           photo $ roomNumber $ secretary $ uid $ userCertificate $
           x500uniqueIdentifier
       )
   )

   For reference, we list the following additional attribute types which
   are inherited from organizationalPerson (which in turn is derived
   from the person object class):
       MUST (
           objectClass $ sn $ cn
       )
       MAY (
           description $ seeAlso $ telephoneNumber $ userPassword $
           destinationIndicator $ facsimileTelephoneNumber $
           internationaliSDNNumber $ l $ ou $
           physicalDeliveryOfficeName $ postOfficeBox $ postalAddress $
           postalCode $ preferredDeliveryMethod $ registeredAddress $
           st $ street $ telephoneNumber $ teletexTerminalIdentifier $
           telexNumber $ title $ x121Address $
       )

Example of an inetOrgPerson Entry

   The following example is expressed using the LDIF notation defined in
   [6].

   dn: cn=Barbara Jensen, ou=Product Development, o=Ace Industry, c=US
   objectClass: top
   objectClass: person
   objectClass: organizationalPerson
   objectClass: inetOrgPerson
   cn: Barbara Jensen
   cn: Babs Jensen
   sn: Jensen
   givenName: Barbara
   initials: BJJ
   title: manager, product development

   The Netscape Directory Server team created the inetOrgPerson object
   class based on experience and customer requirements.  Anil Bhavnani
   and John Kristian in particular deserve credit for all of the early
   design work.
