   If the allocation request is accepted, the DSTM server will
   acknowledge the renewal to the client by sending a 'tunnel' element
   with the attribute 'action' set to 'info', 'type' set to 'v4v6' and
   the 'lifetime' attribute set to the period of validity or lease time
  of the allocation.  No message is sent to the TEP in this case.  At
   the node, the reception of such a message means that allocation time
  has been extended; the timer is reset to the value contained in the
   'lifetime' field.
