                     The Windows Bitmap Media Type
                       draft-seantek-image-bmp-00

Abstract

   This document registers the image/bmp media type for use with the
   Windows Bitmap format (BMP), also known as Device-Independent Bitmap
   (DIB). Originally designed for Microsoft Windows 2.0 and OS/2, these
   bitmaps contain a single raster graphic in a variety of compressed or
   uncompressed formats.

Internet-Draft              Windows Bitmaps                 October 2014


1. Introduction

   Long before the invention of Portable Network Graphics (PNG),
   Microsoft Corporation and IBM Corporation needed to record images in
   a format that their applications and operating systems could easily
   render on low-end machines (Intel 80286). The resulting "BMP" format
   contains a single raster graphic with basic header fields that can be
   easily mapped (or "blitted") to locations in memory. As computing
   moved from 16-bit to 32-bit, BMP evolved to contain 32-bit
   structures. As the 90s wore on, the venerable BMP got boosts with
   support for additional color spaces, color profiles, and compression
   formats. The same basic format can be used to convey 2-bit black-and-
   white bitmaps with a 1-bit alpha mask from the '80s, and full-color
   Ultra HD images on leading-edge displays. BMP is a building block of
   other formats, including Windows Metafiles, Windows Icons, and
   Windows Cursors.

   Many implementations of BMP were created because of Windows'
   commercial success in the 1990s. Usage of the format for interchange
   has [[probably?]] declined since the advent of PNG (for lossless
   raster graphics) and JPEG (for lossy raster graphics); however, a
   large body of free and commercially available BMP artwork exists.
   Since Windows Icons are a building block of "favicon.ico" Web
   technology, an implementer would almost certainly need to support
   this format for basic interoperability.

   Microsoft publicly documented the BMP format as early as the 1992
   Windows 3.1 SDK (in the Windows Metafile documentation). Since 2007
   Microsoft has released the format specification [MS-WMF], which
   includes most components of the Windows Bitmap format, under its Open
   Specification Promise [MS-OSP]. See Section 2.2.2.9 of [MS-WMF]
   (DeviceIndependentBitmap Object). BMP data begins with a
   BITMAPFILEHEADER and is followed by one of the bitmap headers
   (BITMAPINFOHEADER, BITMAPV4HEADER, or BITMAPV5HEADER), optional color
   table data, bitmap data, and optional profile data, in that order
   [BMPSTOR].

   [[TODO: Maybe it is worth considering registering Windows cursors,
   animated cursors, and (re-registering) icons.]]

   The key word "SHOULD" in this document is to be interpreted as
   described in [RFC2119].

3. Windows Bitmap Media Type Registration Application

   Type name: image

   Subtype name: bmp

Internet-Draft              Windows Bitmaps                 October 2014


   Required parameters: None.

   Optional parameters: None.

   Encoding considerations: Binary.

   Security considerations:

     Bitmaps have a mostly unremarkable security history.

     Because BMP data can encapsulate JPEG or PNG data (BI_JPEG, BI_PNG
     values of the Compression enumeration in Section 2.1.1.7 of [MS-
     WMF]), the security considerations of JPEG and PNG processing may
     also apply to BMP.

   Interoperability considerations:

     Windows Bitmaps do not contain text, so no there are no character
     set encoding considerations.

     Uncompressed Windows Bitmaps can be rather large. If there is a
     need to compress an image, modern applications SHOULD consider
     emitting JPEG or PNG data instead of embedding them in BMP
     payloads.

   Published specification: [MS-WMF] and [BMPSTOR].

   Applications that use this media type:

     Office productivity applications; clip art applications; desktop
     publishing applications; Web browsers; graphics processing
     applications.

   Fragment identifier considerations: None.

   Additional information:

     Magic number(s): 42 4D ("BM"), meaning "bitmap". The next
                      field (BITMAPFILEHEADER bfSize) is a
                      little-endian DWORD indicating the size
                      of the bitmap content in bytes.
     File extension(s): .bmp, .dib
     Macintosh file type code(s):
       "BMP ", "BMPf", or "BMPp". Apple has promulgated a
       uniform type identifier (UTI) of "com.microsoft.bmp".
