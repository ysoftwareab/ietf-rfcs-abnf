Internet Draft      Dynamic Authorization Extensions         August 2002

Abstract 
   This document describes the current practices for allowing dynamic
   changes to a user session as implemented by network access server 
   products providing the Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service.
   Namely it documents the current methods for disconnecting and 
   changing data filters applicable to a user session. 

1.0 Introduction

   The RADIUS protocol, defined in [RFC2865] does not support
   unsolicited messages sent from the RADIUS server to the NAS.

   However, there are many instances in which it is desirable for 
   changes to be made to session characteristics without requiring 
   the NAS to initiate the exchange. For example, it may be desirable 
   for administrators to be able to terminate sessions in progress. 
   Alternatively, if the user changes authorization level, this may 
   require that data filters be added/deleted from the session.

   To overcome these limitations, various vendors have implemented 
   additional RADIUS commands in order to be able to support unsolicited
   messages sent from the RADIUS server to the NAS. These extended 
   commands provide support for:

      1) Disconnect messages, and
      2) Change of Filters messages

   The disconnect messages cause a user session to be terminated 
   immediately, whereas change of filter messages modify the applicable
   data filters for the user session.

   The packet format consists of the fields: Code, Identifier, Length, 
   Authenticator, and Attributes in the Type:Length:Value(TLV) formats.
   All the fields hold the same meaning as those described in 
   RADIUS[1].  The Authenticator field must be calculated in the same 
   way as is specified for an Accounting-Request in [RFC2866].

2.0 Current Practices

   This draft outlines the details for Disconnect Messages and 
   Change-of-Filters Messages that are commonly implemented.

2.1 Protocol Port Information

   For either type of request (Disconnect, or Change of Filters), the 
   UDP port 1700 is used as the destination port.  For responses, the 
   source and destination ports are reversed. 

2.2 Identification Attributes

   A number of attributes are used to uniquely identify a user session 
   on the NAS and one, or more, of these should be present in either 
   type of messages (Disconnect or, Change-of-Filters).  The set of 
   attributes includes the following:

                Username(1): This is the name of the user associated 
                             with the session
        Acct-Session-Id(44): This is derived from a RADIUS 
                             Accounting-Start
       Framed-IP-Address(8): This is the IP Address associated with the 
                             session
                NAS-Port(5): This is the Port on which the user 
                             connection is terminated
          NAS-Port-Type(61): The type of port used

   Note: The numbers in parenthesis denote the attribute numbers as 
         documented in [1] & [3].  The ability to use all/some of the 
         identifiers to map to unique/multiple session(s) is beyond the 
         scope of this document.

2.3 Disconnect Messages (DM)
   
   A Disconnect packet is sent by the RADIUS server in order to 
   terminate a user session on a NAS. The Disconnect packet is sent to 
   UDP port 1700, and identifies the session to be terminated by 
   inclusion of one or more identification attributes as described 
   in the section 2.2 above.

         ----------     Disconnect-Request     ----------
        |          |  <--------------------   |          |
        |   NAS    |                          |  Client  |
        |          |   Disconnect-Response    |          | 
        |          |   ---------------------> |          | 
         ----------                            ----------

   Codes used [2]:
         40 - Disconnect-Request
         41 - Disconnect-ACK
         42 - Disconnect-NAK

   A Disconnect Request is followed by a response of either, 
   Disconnect-Ack, if the NAS successfully disconnects the user, or a
   Disconnect-NAK, if it was unable to disconnect the user.
   A Disconnect-Ack may contain the attribute Acct-Terminate-Cause (49)
   with the value set to 6 for Admin-Reset.

2.4 Change-of-Filters Messages(CoF)
   
   The CoF message packets contain information for dynamically changing
   data filters of a user's session.  The data filters can be of either
   ingress, or egress kind, and are sent in addition to the 
   identification attributes as described in section 2.2.

   The port used, and packet format, are the same as that for 
   Disconnect Messages.

   The following attribute should be sent in a Change-of-Filters 
   Request:

       Filter-ID (11) - Indicates the name of a data filter list to be 
                    applied for the session that the identification 
                    attributes map to.

   
         ----------      CoF Request           ----------

        |   NAS    |                          |  Client  |
        |          |     CoF Response         |          | 
        |          |   ---------------------> |          | 
         ----------                            ----------

   Codes used [2]:
         43 - CoF-Request
         44 - CoF-ACK
         45 - CoF-NAK

Internet Draft      Dynamic Authorization Extensions         August 2002

   A Change of Filter request is followed by a response of either,
   CoF-Ack if the NAS is able to successfully change the data filters 
   for the user's session or, a CoF-NAK if it does not succeed.

3.0 Security Considerations

    The protocol exchanges described are susceptible to the same 
    vulnerabilities as RADIUS and it is recommended that IPSec be 
    employed to afford better security.

    Within RADIUS, a shared secret is used for hiding of attributes such
    as User-Password [1]. In addition, the shared secret is used in 
    computation of the Response Authenticator [1], Therefore, in
    RADIUS a shared secret is used to provide confidentiality as well
    as integrity protection and authentication.  As a result, only use 
    of IPSEC ESP with a non-null transform can provide security services
    sufficient to substitute for RADIUS application-layer security.
    Therefore, where IPSEC AH or ESP null is used, it will typically
    still be necessary to configure a RADIUS shared secret.

    However, where RADIUS is run over IPSEC ESP with a non-null
    transform, the secret shared between the NAS and the RADIUS server
    may not be configured.  In this case, a shared secret of zero length
    must be assumed [7].

    Additionally, when IPsec is used with RADIUS, DES-CBC should not be 
    used as the encryption transform, and per-packet replay protection 
    and authentication must be used. A typical IPsec policy for an
    IPsec-capable RADIUS client is "Initiate IPsec, from me to any, 
    destination port UDP 1812", similarly for clients implementing 
    this specification the policy would be "Initiate IPsec, from me to 
    any, destination port UDP 1700".

    This causes an IPsec SA to be set up by the RADIUS client prior to 
    sending RADIUS traffic to any RADIUS server. If some RADIUS servers 
    contacted by the client do not support IPsec, then a more granular 
    policy will be required.

    For an IPsec-capable RADIUS server, a typical IPsec policy is
    "Accept IPsec, from any to me, destination port 1812" and for
    servers implementing this specification the policy would be
    "Accept IPsec, from any to me, destination port 1700".  This causes 
    the RADIUS server to accept (but not require) use of IPsec. It may 
    not be appropriate to require IPsec for all RADIUS clients 
    connecting to an IPsec-enabled RADIUS server, since some RADIUS 
    clients may not support IPsec.

Internet draft      Dynamic Authorization Extensions         August 2002

    Where no RADIUS shared secret is configured, and IPsec with ESP and
    non-null transform is used for security, it is important that trust 
    be demonstrated between the RADIUS client and RADIUS server by some 
    means.  For example, it would not be wise to enable any host with a 
    certificate chaining to a trusted root to act as a RADIUS client, 
    unless that host were specifically authorized to provide network 
    access. This can be accomplished by configuring the RADIUS server to
    expect communication from a RADIUS client, either by configuring it 
    with the machine name of the RADIUS client (expected to be present 
    in the certificate), or its IP address.

    Alternatively, if a separate CA exists for RADIUS clients, then
    the RADIUS server can configure this CA as a trusted root for use 
    with IPsec. However, since unlike SSL/TLS, IKE does not permit 
    certificate policies to be set on a per-port basis, such a policy 
    would need to apply to all uses of IPsec on RADIUS clients and 
    servers. Thus, assuming that only certificate authentication is 
    supported in the deployment, a management station initiating an 
    IPSec-protected telnet session to the RADIUS server would need to 
    obtain a certificate chaining to the RADIUS client CA. Issuing such 
    a certificate might  not be appropriate if the management station 
    was not authorized as a RADIUS client."
    
    Since this specification utilizes the Request Authenticator field 
    for integrity protection and authentication, rather than as a nonce,
    no liveness or protection against replay is provided by the RADIUS 
    header.  

    Where IPsec is not used, in order to provide replay 
    protection, the Event-Timestamp (55) attribute, described in [4] 
    SHOULD be included. When this attribute is present, the RADIUS 
    server MUST check that the Event-Timestamp is current within an 
    acceptable time window. This implies the need for time 
    synchronization within the network, which can be achieved
    using secure NTP, as described in [6]. A default time window of 300
    seconds is recommended.
