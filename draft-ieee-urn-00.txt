                        draft-ieee-urn-00

Abstract

   This document describes the Namespace Identifier (NID) 'ieee' for
   Uniform Resource Names (URNs) used to identify resources published by
   the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).  IEEE
   specifies and manages resources that utilize this URN identification
   model.  Management activities for these and other resources types are
   handled by the manager of the IEEE Registration Authority.

1.  Introduction

   The Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) is an
   organization whose objectives include the educational and technical
   advancement of electrical and electronic engineering,
   telecommunications, computer engineering and allied disciplines.
   Within IEEE, standardiation activities are organized into sponsors,
   such as the LAN/MAN Stadnards Commitee, and then working groups 
   such as 802.1 and 802.3.

   As part of these specifications efforts, there is a need to identify
   identifiers in a managed namespace that are unique and persistent.
   To ensure that this namespace's uniqueness is absolute, a
   registration of a specific Unified Resource Name (URN) URN Syntax
   [RFC2141] Namespace Identifier (NID) for use by IEEE is being
   specified in this document, in full conformance with the NID
   registration process specified in URN Namespace Definition Mechanism
   [RFC3406].

2.  URN Specification for IEEE

   Namespace ID:

   	IEEE

   Registration information:

   	registration version number: 1

   	registration date: 2015-09-01

   Declared registrant of the namespace:

   	Registering organization:

   		Name: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers

   		Address:      445 Hoes Lane 
                    Piscataway, NJ 08854
                    USA

   		Designated contact:   Angela Thomas

   			Role: Manager, IEEE Registration Authority 

   			Email:  a.n.thomas@ieee.org

   Declaration of syntactic structure:

   	The Namespace Specific String (NSS) of all URNs that use the 
   	IEEE NID will have the following structure:
   	  The Namespace Specific String (NSS) of all URNs that use the IEEE
      NID will have the following structure:

         urn:ieee:{IEEEresource}:{ResourceSpecificString}

      where the "IEEEresource" is a US-ASCII string that conforms to the
      URN syntax requirements [RFC2141] and defines a specific class of
      resource type.  Each resource type has a specific labeling scheme

      that is covered by "ResourceSpecificString", which also conforms
      to the naming requirements of [RFC2141].

      IEEE maintains a registration authority, the IEEE Registration 
      Authority (IEEE RA), that will manage the assignment of 
      "IEEEresource" and the specific registration values assigned 
      for each resource class.

   Relevant ancillary documentation:

      The IEEE Registration Authority (IEEE RA) provides information on
      the registered resources and the registrations for each.  More
      information about IEEE RA and the registration activities and
      procedures to be followed are available at:
      
      https://standards.ieee.org/develop/regauth/ 

   Identifier uniqueness considerations:

   	  The IEEE RA will manage resources using the IEEE NID and will be
      the authority for managing the resources and subsequent strings
      associated.  In the associated procedures, IEEE RA will ensure the
      uniqueness of the strings themselves or shall permit secondary
      responsibility for management of well-defined sub-trees.

   Identifier persistence considerations:

  		IEEE will provide clear documentation of the registered uses of
      the IEEE NID.  This will be structured such that each 
      "IEEEresource" will have a separate description and registration
      table.

      The registration tables and information will be published and
      maintained by the IEEE RA on its web site.

   Process of identifier assignment:

   	 IEEE will provide procedures for registration of each type of
     resource that it maintains.

   Process of identifier resolution:

   	 The namespace is not listed with an RDS; this is not relevant.

   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:

   	No special considerations; the rules for lexical equivalence of
    [RFC2141] apply.

   Conformance with URN Syntax:

   	No special considerations.
   	
   Validation mechanism:

   	  None specified.  URN assignment will be handled by procedures
      implemented in support of IEEE activities.

   Scope:

   	Global

3.  Examples

   The following examples are representative urns that could be assigned
   by IEEE RA.  They may not be the actual strings that would be 
   assigned.

      urn:ieee:std:802.1Q:YANG

      urn:ieee:foobar

4.  Security Considerations

   There are no additional security considerations other than those
   normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general,
   which are described in Functional Requirements for URN [RFC1737], URN
   Syntax [RFC2141], and URN Namespace Definition Mechanism [RFC3406].

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document adds a new entry ("ieee") in the urn-namespace
   registry.  This is the defining document.  When published, the entry
   can be found in the "Uniform Resource Names (URN) Namespaces"
   registry available from the IANA site (http://www.iana.org) and any
   associated mirrors.
