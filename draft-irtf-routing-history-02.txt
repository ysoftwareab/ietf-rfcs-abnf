Internet-Draft                 IDR History                  October 2005


1.  Provenance of this Document

   In 2001, the IRTF Routing Research Group (IRTF RRG) chairs, Abha
   Ahuja and Sean Doran, decided to establish a sub-group to look at
   requirements for inter-domain routing (IDR).  A group of well known
   routing experts was assembled to develop requirements for a new
   routing architecture.  Their mandate was to approach the problem
   starting from a blank sheet.  This group was free to take any
   approach, including a revolutionary approach, in developing
   requirements for solving the problems they saw in inter-domain
   routing.

   Simultaneously, an independent effort was started in Sweden with a
   similar goal.  A team, calling itself Babylon, representing vendors,
   service providers, and academia, assembled to understand the history
   of inter-domain routing, to research the problems seen by the service
   providers, and to develop a proposal of requirements for a follow-on
   to the current routing architecture.  This group's approach required
   an evolutionary approach starting from current routing architecture
   and practice.  In other words the group limited itself to developing
   an evolutionary strategy.  The Babylon group was later folded into
   the IRTF RRG as Sub-Group&nbsp;B.

   This document, which was a part of Sub-group B's output, provides a
   snapshot of the current state of Inter-Domain Routing (IDR) at the
   time of original writing (2001) with some minor updates to take into
   account developments since that date, bringing it up to date in 2005.
   The development of the new requirments set is then motivated by an
   analysis of the problems that IDR has been encountering in the recent
   past.  This document is intended as a counterpart to the Routing
   Requirements document which captures the requirements for future
   domain routing systems as captured separately by the IRTF RRG Sub-
   groups A and B [I-D.irtf-routing-reqs].


2.  Introduction

   It is generally accepted that there are major shortcomings in the
   inter-domain routing of the Internet today and that these may result
   in severe routing problems within an unspecified period of time.
   Remedying these shortcomings will require extensive research to tie
   down the exact failure modes that lead to these shortcomings and
   identify the best techniques to remedy the situation.

   Changes in the nature and quality of the services that users want
   from the Internet are difficult to provide within the current
   framework, as they impose requirements never foreseen by the original
   architects of the Internet routing system.

Internet-Draft                 IDR History                  October 2005


   The kind of radical changes that have to accommodated are epitomized
   by the advent of IPv6 and the application of IP mechanisms to private
   commercial networks that offer specific service guarantees beyond the
   best-effort services of the public Internet.  Major changes to the
   inter-domain routing system are inevitable to provide an efficient
   underpinning for the radically changed and increasingly commercially-
   based networks that rely on the IP protocol suite.

   Current practice stresses the need to separate the concerns of the
   control plane in a router and the forwarding plane: This document
   will follow this practice, but we still use the term 'routing' as a
   global portmanteau to cover all aspects of the system.

   This document provides a historical perspective on the current state
   of domain routing in Section 3 by revisiting the previous IETF
   requirements document intended to steer the development of a future
   routing system.  These requirements, which led to the design of the
   Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) in 1989, are contained in RFC1126 -
   "Goals and Functional Requirements for Inter-Autonomous System
   Routing" [RFC1126].

   Section 3 also looks at some other work on requirements for domain
   routing that was carried out before and after RFC1126 was published.
   This work fleshes out the historical perspective and provides some
   additional insights into alternative approaches which may be
   instructive when building a new set of requirements.

   The motivation for change and the inspiration for some of the
   requirements for new routing architectures derive from the problems
   attributable to the current domain routing system that are being
   experienced in the Internet today.  These will be discussed in
   Section 4.

2.1.  Background

   Today's Internet uses an addressing and routing structure that has
   developed in an ad hoc, more or less upwards-compatible fashion.  It
   has progressed from handling a non-commercial Internet with a single
   administrative domain to a solution that is just about controlling
   today's multi-domain, federated Internet, carrying traffic between
   the networks of commercial, governmental and not-for-profit
   participants.  As well as directing traffic to its intended end-
   point, inter-domain routing mechanisms are expected to implement a
   host of domain specific routing policies for competing, communicating
   domains.  The result is not ideal, particularly as regards inter-
   domain routing mechanisms, but it does a pretty fair job at its
   primary goal of providing any-to-any connectivity to many millions of
   computers.

   Based on a large body of anecdotal evidence, but also on a growing
   body of experimental evidence [Labovitz02] and analytic work on the
   stability of BGP under certain policy specifications [Griffin99], the
   main Internet inter-domain routing protocol, BGP version 4 (BGP-4),
   appears to have a number of problems that need to be resolved.
   Additionally, the hierarchical nature of the inter-domain routing
   problem appears to be changing as the connectivity between domains
   becomes increasingly meshed [RFC3221] which alters some of the
   scaling and structuring assumptions on which BGP-4 is built.  Patches
   and fix-ups may relieve some of these problems but others may require
   a new architecture and new protocols.


3.  Historical Perspective

3.1.  The Legacy of RFC1126

   RFC1126 [RFC1126] outlined a set of requirements that were to guide
   the development of BGP.  While the network is demonstrably different
   from what it was in 1989, both as to structure and size, many of the
   same requirements remain.  As a first step in setting requirements
   for the future, we need to understand the requirements that were
   originally set for the current protocols.  And in charting a future
   architecture we must first be sure to do no harm.  This means a
   future domain routing system has to support as its base requirement,
   the level of function that is available today.

   The following sections each relate to a requirement, or non-
   requirement listed in RFC1126.  In fact the section names are direct
   quotes from the document.  The discussion of these requirements
   covers the following areas:

   Explanation:       Optional interpretation for today's audience of
                      the original intent of the requirement

   Relevance:         Is the requirement of RFC1126 still relevant, and
                      to what degree?  Should it be understood
                      differently in today's environment?

   Current practice:  How well is the requirement met by current
                      protocols and practice?

3.1.1.  "General Requirements"

3.1.1.1.  "Route to Destination"

   Timely routing to all reachable destinations, including multihoming
   and multicast.

Internet-Draft                 IDR History                  October 2005


   Relevance:         Valid, but requirements for multihoming need
                      further discussion and elucidation.  The
                      requirement should include multiple source
                      multicast routing.

   Current practice:  Multihoming is not efficient and the proposed
                      inter-domain multicast protocol BGMP [RFC3913] is
                      an add-on to BGP following many of the same
                      strategies but not integrated into the BGP
                      framework .

3.1.1.2.  "Routing is Assured"

   This requires that a user be notified within a reasonable time period
   of attempts, about inability to provide a service.

   Relevance:         Valid

   Current practice:  There are ICMP messages for this, but in many
                      cases they are not used, either because of fears
                      about creating message storms or uncertainty about
                      whether the end system can do anything useful with
                      the resulting information.  IPv6 implementations
                      may be able to make better use of the information
                      as they may have alternative addresses that might
                      provide

3.1.1.3.  "Large System"

   The architecture was designed to accommodate the growth of the
   Internet.

   Relevance:         Valid.  Properties of Internet topology might be
                      an issue for future scalability (topology varies
                      from very sparse to quite dense at present).
                      Instead of setting growth in a time-scale,
                      indefinite growth should be accommodated.  On the
                      other hand, such growth has to be accommodated
                      without making the protocols too expensive -
                      trade-offs may be necessary.

   Current practice:  Scalability of the current protocols will not be
                      sufficient under the current rate of growth.
                      There are problems with BGP convergence for large
                      dense topologies, problems with routing
                      information propagation between routers in transit
                      domain, limited support for hierarchy, etc.

3.1.1.4.  "Autonomous Operation"

   This requirement encapsulates the need for administative domains
   ("Autonomous Systems" - AS) to be able to operate autonomously as
   regards setting routing policy:
   Relevance:         Valid.  There may need to be additional
                      requirements for adjusting policy decisions to the
                      global functionality and for avoiding
                      contradictory policies.  This would decrease the
                      possibility of unstable routing behavior.

                      There is a need for handling various degrees of
                      trust in autonomous operations, ranging from no
                      trust (e.g., between separate ISPs) to very high
                      trust where the domains have a common goal of
                      optimizing their mutual policies.

                      Policies for intra domain operations should in
                      some cases be revealed, using suitable
                      abstractions.

   Current practice:  Policy management is in the control of network
                      managers, as required, but there is little support
                      for handling policies at an abstract level for a
                      domain.

                      Cooperating administrative entities decide about
                      the extent of cooperation independently.  Lack of
                      coordination combined with global range of effects
                      results in occasional melt-down of Internet
                      routing.

3.1.1.5.  "Distributed System"

   The routing environment is a distributed system.  The distributed
   routing environment supports redundancy and diversity of nodes and
   links.  Both data and operations are distributed.

   Relevance:         Valid.  RFC1126 is very clear that we should not
                      be using centralized solutions, but maybe we need
                      a discussion on trade-offs between common
                      knowledge and distribution (i.e., to allow for
                      uniform policy routing, e.g., GSM systems are in a
                      sense centralized, but with hierarchies)

Internet-Draft                 IDR History                  October 2005


   Current practice:  Routing is very distributed, but lacking abilities
                      to consider optimization over several hops or
                      domains.

3.1.1.6.  "Provide A Credible Environment"

   Routing mechanism information must be integral and secure (credible
   data, reliable operation).  Security from unwanted modification and
   influence is required.

   Relevance:         Valid.

   Current practice:  BGP provides a mechanism for authentication and
                      security.

                      There are however security problems with current
                      practice.  The Routing Protocol Security
                      Requirements (rpsec) working group has been
                      struggling to agree on a set of requirements for
                      BGP security since early 2002.

3.1.1.7.  "Be A Managed Entity"

   Requires that a manager should get enough information on a state of
   network so that s/he could make informed decisions.

   Relevance:         The requirement is reasonable, but we might need
                      to be more specific on what information should be
                      available, e.g. to prevent routing oscillations.

   Current practice:  All policies are determined locally, where they
                      may appear reasonable but there is limited global
                      coordination through the routing policy databases
                      operated by the Internet registries (ARIN, RIPE,
                      APNIC etc).

                      Operators are not required to register their
                      policies; even when policies are registered, it is
                      difficult to check that the actual policies in use
                      match the declared policies and therefore a
                      manager cannot guarantee to make a globally
                      consistent decision.

3.1.1.8.  "Minimize Required Resources"

Internet-Draft                 IDR History                  October 2005


   Relevance:         Valid, however, the paragraph states that
                      assumptions on significant upgrades shouldn't be
                      made.  Although this is reasonable, a new
                      architecture should perhaps be prepared to use
                      upgrades when they occur.

   Current practice:  Most bandwidth is consumed by the exchange of the
                      Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI).
                      Usage of processing cycles ("Central Processor
                      Usage" - CPU) depends on the stability of the
                      Internet.  Both phenomena have a local nature, so
                      there are not scaling problems with bandwidth and
                      CPU usage.  Instability of routing increases the
                      consumption of resources in any case.  The number
                      of networks in the Internet dominates memory
                      requirements - this is a scaling problem.

3.1.2.  "Functional Requirements"

3.1.2.1.  "Route Synthesis Requirements"

3.1.2.1.1.  "Route around failures dynamically"

   Relevance:         Valid.  Should perhaps be stronger.  Only
                      providing a best-effort attempt may not be enough
                      if real-time services are to be provided for.
                      Detections may need to be faster than 100ms to
                      avoid being noticed by end-users.

   Current practice:  Latency of fail-over is too high; sometimes
                      minutes or longer.

3.1.2.1.2.  "Provide loop free paths"

   Relevance:         Valid.  Loops should occur only with negligible
                      probability and duration.

   Current practice:  Both link-state intra domain routing and BGP
                      inter- domain routing (if correctly configured)
                      are forwarding- loop free after having converged.
                      However, convergence time for BGP can be very long
                      and poorly designed routing policies may result in
                      a number of BGP speakers engaging in a cyclic
                      pattern of advertisements and withdrawals which
                      never converges to a stable result [I-D.mcpherson-
                      bgp-route-oscillation].  Perhaps this is one
                      context in which the need for global convergence
                      needs to be reviewed.

3.1.2.1.3.  "Know when a path or destination is unavailable"

   Relevance:         Valid to some extent, but there is a trade-off
                      between aggregation and immediate knowledge of
                      reachability.  It requires that routing tables
                      contain enough information to determine that the
                      destination is unknown or a path cannot be
                      constructed to reach it.

   Current practice:  Knowledge about lost reachability propagates
                      slowly through the networks due to slow
                      convergence for route withdrawals.

3.1.2.1.4.  "Provide paths sensitive to administrative policies"

   Relevance:         Valid.  Policy control of routing is of
                      increasingly importance as the Internet has turned
                      into a business.

   Current practice:  Supported to some extent.  Policies can only be
                      applied locally in an AS and not globally.  At
                      least there is a very small probability of
                      affecting policies in other AS's.  Furthermore,
                      only static policies are supported; between static
                      policies and policies dependent upon volatile
                      events of great celerity` there should exist
                      events that routing should be aware of.  Lastly,
                      there is no support for policies other than route-
                      properties (such as AS-origin, AS-path,
                      destination prefix, MED-values etc).

3.1.2.1.5.  "Provide paths sensitive to user policies"

   Relevance:         Valid to some extent, as they may conflict with
                      the policies of the network administrator.  It is
                      likely that this requirement will be met by means
                      of different bit transport services offered by an
                      operator, but at the cost of adequate
                      provisioning, authentication and policing when
                      utilizing the service.

   Current practice:  Not supported in normal routing.  Can be
                      accomplished to some extent with loose source
                      routing, resulting in inefficient forwarding in
                      the routers.  The various attempts to introduce
                      Quality of Service (QoS - e.g., Integrated
                      Services and Differentiated Services -(DiffServ))
                      can also be seen as means to support this

                      requirement but they have met with limited success
                      in terms of providing alternate routes as opposed
                      to providing improved service on the standard
                      route.

3.1.2.1.6.  "Provide paths which characterize user quality-of-service
            requirements"

   Relevance:         Valid to some extent, as they may conflict with
                      the policies of the operator.  It is likely that
                      this requirement will be met by means of different
                      bit transport services offered by an operator, but
                      at the cost of adequate provisioning,
                      authentication and policing when utilizing the
                      service.  It has become clear that offering to
                      provide a particular QoS to any arbitrary
                      destination from a particular source is generally
                      impossible: QoS except in very 'soft' forms such
                      as overall long term average packet delay, is
                      generally associated with connection oriented
                      routing.

   Current practice:  Creating routes with specified QoS is not
                      generally possible at present.

3.1.2.1.7.  "Provide autonomy between inter- and intra-autonomous system
            route synthesis"

   Relevance:         Inter- and intra-domain routing should stay
                      independent, but one should notice that this to
                      some extent contradicts the previous three
                      requirements.  There is a trade-off between
                      abstraction and optimality.

   Current practice:  Inter-domain routing is performed independently of
                      intra-domain routing.  Intra-domain routing is,
                      especially in transit domains, very interrelated
                      to inter-domain routing.

3.1.2.2.  "Forwarding Requirements"

3.1.2.2.1.  "Decouple inter- and intra-autonomous system forwarding
            decisions"

Internet-Draft                 IDR History                  October 2005


   Relevance:         Valid.

   Current practice:  As explained in Section 3.1.2.1.7, intra-domain
                      forwarding in transit domains is codependent with
                      inter-domain forwarding decisions.

3.1.2.2.2.  "Do not forward datagrams deemed administratively
            inappropriate"

   Relevance:         Valid, and increasingly important in the context
                      of enforcing policies correctly expressed through
                      routing advertisements but flouted by rogue peers
                      which send traffic for which a route has not been
                      advertised.  On the other hand, packets that have
                      been misrouted due to transient routing problems
                      perhaps should be forwarded to reach the
                      destination, although along an unexpected path.

   Current practice:  At stub domains there is packet filtering, e.g.,
                      to catch source address spoofing on outgoing
                      traffic or to filter out unwanted incoming
                      traffic.  Filtering can in particular reject
                      traffic (such as unauthorized transit traffic)
                      that has been sent to a domain even when it has
                      not advertised a route for such traffic on a given
                      interface.  The growing class of 'middle boxes'
                      (midboxes, e.g., Network Address Translators -
                      NATs) is quite likely to apply administrative
                      rules that will prevent forwarding of packets.
                      Note that security policies may deliberately hide
                      administrative denials.  In the backbone,
                      intentional packet dropping based on policies is
                      not common.

3.1.2.2.3.  "Do not forward datagrams to failed resources"

   Relevance:         Unclear, although it is clearly desirable to
                      minimise waste of forwarding resources by
                      discarding datagrams which cannot be delivered at
                      the earliest opportunity.  There is a trade-off
                      between scalability and keeping track of
                      unreachable resources.  Equipment closest to a
                      failed node has the highest motivation to keep
                      track of failures so that waste can be minimised.

   Current practice:  Routing protocols use both internal adjacency
                      management sub-protocols (e.g.  Hello protocols)
                      and information from equipment and lower layer
                      link watchdogs to keep track of failures in
                      routers and connecting links.  Failures will
                      eventually result in the routing protocol
                      reconfiguring the routing to avoid (if possible) a
                      failed resource, but this is generally very slow
                      (30s or more).  In the meantime datagrams may well
                      be forwarded to failed resources.  In general
                      terms, end hosts and some non-router midboxes do
                      not participate in these notifications and
                      failures of such boxes will not affect the routing
                      system.

3.1.2.2.4.  "Forward datagram according to its characteristics"

   Relevance:         Valid.  This is necessary in enabling
                      differentiation in the network, based on QoS,
                      precedence, policy or security.

   Current practice:  Ingress and egress filtering can be done based on
                      policy.  Some networks discriminate on the basis
                      of requested QoS.

3.1.2.3.  "Information Requirements"

3.1.2.3.1.  "Provide a distributed and descriptive information base"

   Relevance:         Valid, however hierarchical information bases
                      might provide more possibilities.

   Current practice:  The information base is distributed, but it is
                      unclear whether it supports all necessary routing
                      functionality.

3.1.2.3.2.  "Determine resource availability"

   Relevance:         Valid.  It should be possible for resource
                      availability and levels of resource availability
                      to be determined.  This prevents needing to
                      discover unavailability through failure.  Resource
                      location and discovery is arguably a separate
                      concern that could be addressed outside the core
                      routing requirements.

   Current practice:  Resource availability is predominantly handled
                      outside of the routing system.

3.1.2.3.3.  "Restrain transmission utilization"

   Relevance:         Valid.  However certain requirements in the
                      control plane, such as fast detection of faults
                      may be worth consumption of more resources.
                      Similarly, simplicity of implementation may make
                      it cheaper to 'back haul' traffic to central
                      locations to minimise the cost of routing if
                      bandwidth is cheaper than processing.

   Current practice:  BGP messages probably do not ordinarily consume
                      excessive resources, but might during erroneous
                      conditions.  In the data plane, the near universal
                      adoption of shortest path protocols could be
                      considered to result in minimization of
                      transmission utilization.

3.1.2.3.4.  "Allow limited information exchange"

   Relevance:         Valid.  But perhaps routing could be improved if
                      certain information could be available either
                      globally or at least for a wider defined locality.

   Current practice:  Policies are used to determine which reachability
                      information is exported.

3.1.2.4.  "Environmental Requirements"

3.1.2.4.1.  "Support a packet-switching environment"

   Relevance:         Valid but routing system should, perhaps, not be
                      limited to this exclusively.

   Current practice:  Supported.

3.1.2.4.2.  "Accommodate a connection-less oriented user transport
            service"

   Relevance:         Valid, but routing system should, perhaps, not be
                      limited to this exclusively.

   Current practice:  Accommodated.

3.1.2.4.3.  "Accommodate 10K autonomous systems and 100K networks"

   Relevance:         No longer valid.  Needs to be increased
                      potentially indefinitely.  It is extremely
                      difficult to foresee the future size expansion of
                      the Internet so that the utopian solution would be
                      to achieve an Internet whose architecture is scale
                      invariant.  Regrettably, this may not be
                      achievable without introducing undesirable
                      complexity and a suitable trade off between
                      complexity and scalability is likely to be
                      necessary.

   Current Practice:  Supported but perhaps reaching its limit.  Since
                      the original version of this document was written
                      in 2001, the number of ASs advertised has grown
                      from around 8000 to 20000, and almost 35000 AS
                      numbers have been allocated by the regional
                      registries. (ref to
                      http://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2005-08/as.html) If
                      this growth continues the original 16 bit AS space
                      in BGP-4 will be exhausted in less than 5 years.
                      Planning for an extended AS space is now an urgent
                      requirement.

3.1.2.4.4.  "Allow for arbitrary interconnection of autonomous systems"

   Relevance:         Valid.  However perhaps not all interconnections
                      should be accessible globally.

   Current practice:  BGP-4 allows for arbitrary interconnections.

3.1.2.5.  "General Objectives"

3.1.2.5.1.  "Provide routing services in a timely manner"

   Relevance:         Valid, as stated before.  The more complex a
                      service is the longer it should be allowed to
                      take, but the implementation of services requiring
                      (say) NP-complete calculation should be avoided.

   Current practice:  More or less, with the exception of convergence
                      and fault robustness.

3.1.2.5.2.  "Minimize constraints on systems with limited resources"

   Relevance:         Valid

   Current practice:  Systems with limited resources are typically stub
                      domains that advertise very little information.

3.1.2.5.3.  "Minimize impact of dissimilarities between autonomous
            systems"

   Relevance:         Important.  This requirement is critical to a
                      future architecture.  In a domain routing
                      environment where the internal properties of
                      domains may differ radically, it will be important
                      to be sure that these dissimilarities are
                      minimized at the borders.
   Current: practice: For the most part this capability is not really
                      required in today's networks since the intra-
                      domain attributes are broadly similar across
                      domains.

3.1.2.5.4.  "Accommodate the addressing schemes and protocol mechanisms
            of the autonomous systems"

   Relevance:         Important, probably more so than when RFC1126 was
                      originally developed because of the potential
                      deployment of IPv6, wider usage of MPLS and the
                      increasing usage of VPNs.

   Current practice:  Only one global addressing scheme is supported in
                      most autonomous systems but the availability of
                      IPv6 services is steadily increasing.  Some global
                      backbones support IPv6 routing and forwarding.

3.1.2.5.5.  "Must be implementable by network vendors"

   Relevance:         Valid, but note that what can be implemented today
                      is different from what was possible when RFC1126
                      was written: a future domain routing architecture
                      should not be unreasonably constrained by past
                      limitations.

   Current practice:  BGP was implemented.

3.1.3.  "Non-Goals"

   RFC1126 also included a section discussing non-goals.  To what extent
   are these still non-goals?  Does the fact that they were non-goals

   adversely affect today's IDR system?

3.1.3.1.  "Ubiquity"

   In a sense this 'non-goal' has effectively been achieved by the
   Internet and IP protocols.  This requirement reflects a different
   worldview where there was serious competition for network protocols,
   which is really no longer the case.  Ubiquitous deployment of inter-
   domain routing in particular has been achieved and must not be undone
   by any proposed future domain routing architecture.  On the other
   hand:
   o  ubiquitous connectivity cannot be reached in a policy sensitive
      environment and should not be an aim,
   o  it must not be required that the same routing mechanisms are used
      throughout provided that they can interoperate appropriately
   o  the information needed to control routing in a part of the network
      should not necessarily be ubiquitously available and it must be
      possible for an operator to hide commercially sensitive
      information that is not needed outside a domain.

   Relevance:         De facto essential for a future domain routing
                      architecture, but what is required is ubiquity of
                      the routing system rather than ubiquity of
                      connectivity.

   Current practice:  De facto ubiquity achieved.

3.1.3.2.  "Congestion control"

   Relevance:         It is not clear if this non-goal was to be applied
                      to routing or forwarding.  It is definitely a non-
                      goal to adapt the choice of route when there is
                      transient congestion.  However, to add support for
                      congestion avoidance (e.g., ECN and ICMP messages)
                      in the forwarding process would be a useful
                      addition.  There is also extensive work going on
                      in traffic engineering which should result in
                      congestion avoidance through routing as well as in
                      forwarding.

   Current practice:  Some ICMP messages (e.g., source quench) exist to
                      deal with congestion control but these are not
                      generally used as they either make the problem
                      worse or there is no mechanism to reflect the
                      message into the application which is providing
                      the source.

3.1.3.3.  "Load splitting"

   Relevance:         This should neither be a non-goal, nor an explicit
                      goal.  It might be desirable in some cases and
                      should be considered as an optional architectural
                      feature.

   Current practice:  Can be implemented by exporting different prefixes
                      on different links, but this requires manual
                      configuration and does not consider actual load.

3.1.3.4.  "Maximizing the utilization of resources"

   Relevance:         Valid.  Cost-efficiency should be strived for;
                      maximizing resource utilization does not always
                      lead to greatest cost-efficiency.

   Current practice:  Not currently part of the system, though often a
                      'hacked in' feature done with manual
                      configuration.

3.1.3.5.  "Schedule to deadline service"

   This non-goal was put in place to ensure that the IDR did not have to
   meet real time deadline goals such as might apply to CBR services in
   ATM.

   Relevance:         The hard form of deadline services is still a non-
                      goal for the future domain routing architecture
                      but overall delay bounds are much more of the
                      essence than was the case when RFC1126 was
                      written.

   Current practice:  Service providers are now offering overall
                      probabilistic delay bounds on traffic contracts.
                      To implement these contracts there is a
                      requirement for a rather looser form of delay
                      sensitive routing.

3.1.3.6.  "Non-interference policies of resource utilization"

   The requirement in RFC1126 is somewhat opaque, but appears to imply
   that what we would today call QoS routing is a non-goal and that
   routing would not seek to control the elastic characteristics of
   Internet traffic whereby a TCP connection can seek to utilize all the
   spare bandwidth on a route, possibly to the detriment of other
   connections sharing the route or crossing it.

   Relevance:         Open Issue.  It is not clear whether dynamic QoS
                      routing can or should be implemented.  Such a
                      system would seek to control the admission and
                      routing of traffic depending on current or recent
                      resource utilization.  This would be particularly
                      problematic where traffic crosses an ownership
                      boundary because of the need for potentially
                      commercially sensitive information to be made
                      available outside the ownership boundary.

   Current practice:  Routing does not consider dynamic resource
                      availability.  Forwarding can support service
                      differentiation.

3.2.  ISO OSI IDRP, BGP and the Development of Policy Routing

   During the decade before the widespread success of the World Wide
   Web, ISO was developing the comunications architecture and protocol
   suite Open Systems Intercnnection (OSI).  For a considerable part of
   this time OSI was seen as a possible competitor for and even a
   replacement for the IP suite as this basis for the Internet.  The
   technical developments of the two protocols were quite heavily
   interrelated with each providing ideas and even components that were
   adapted into the other suite.

   During the early stages of the development of OSI, the IP suite was
   still mainly in use on the ARPANET and the relatively small scale
   first phase NSFNET.  This was a effectively a single administrative
   domain with a simple tree structured network in a three level
   hierarchy connected to a single logical exchange point (the NSFnet
   backbone).  In the second half of the 1980s the NSFNET was starting
   on the growth and transformation that would lead to today's Internet.
   It was becoming clear that the backbone routing protocol, the
   Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP)[RFC0904], was not going to cope even
   with the limited expansion being planned.  EGP is an "all informed"
   protocol which needed to know the identities of all gateways and this
   was no longer reasonable.  The first version of the Border Gateway
   Protocol (BGP-1) [RFC1105]was developed as a replacement, but was
   specifically designed to work on a tree structured network (links are
   classified as upwards, downwards or sideways).

   Meanwhile the OSI architects, led by Lyman Chapin, were developing a
   much more general architecture for large scale networks.  They had
   recognized that no one node, especially an end-system (host) could or
   should attempt to remember routes from "here" to "anywhere" - this
   sounds obvious today but was not so obvious 20 years ago.  They were
   also considering hierarchical networks with independently
   administered domains - a model already well entrenched in the public



Doria & Davies           Expires April 27, 2006                [Page 19]

Internet-Draft                 IDR History                  October 2005


   switched telephone network.  This led to a vision of a network with
   multiple independent administrative domains with an arbitrary
   interconnection graph and a hierarchy of routing functionality.  This
   architecture was fairly well established by 1987 [Tsuchiya87].  The
   architecture initially envisaged a three level routing functionality
   hierarchy in which each layer had significantly different
   characteristics:

   1.  _End-system to Intermediate system routing _(host to router), in
       which the principal functions are discovery and redirection.

   2.  _Intra-domain intermediate system to intermediate system routing
       _(router to router), in which "best" routes between end-systems
       in a single administrative domain are computed and used.  A
       single algorithm and routing protocol would be used throughout
       any one domain.

   3.  _Inter-domain intermediate-system to intermediate system routing_
       (router to router), in which routes between routing domains
       within administrative domains are computed (routing is considered
       spearately between administrative domains and routing domains).

   Level 3 of this hierarchy was still somewhat fuzzy.  Tsuchiya says:

      The last two components, Inter-Domain and Inter-Administration
      routing, are less clear-cut.  It is not obvious what should be
      standardized with respect to these two components of routing.  For
      example, for Inter-Domain routing, what can be expected from the
      Domains?  By asking Domains to provide some kind of external
      behavior, we limit their autonomy.  If we expect nothing of their
      external behavior, then routing functionality will be minimal.

      Across administrations, it is not known how much trust there will
      be.  In fact, the definition of trust itself can only be
      determined by the two or more administrations involved.

      Fundamentally, the problem with Inter-Domain and Inter-
      Administration routing is that autonomy and mistrust are both
      antithetical to routing.  Accomplishing either wilI involve a
      number of tradeoffs which will require more knowledge about the
      environments within which they will operate.

   Further refinement of the model occurred over the next couple of
   years and a more fully formed view is given by Huitema and Dabbous in
   1989 [Huitema90] [Routeing protocols development in the OSI
   architecture].  By this stage work on the original IS-IS link state
   protocol, originated by the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), was
   fairly advanced and was close to becoming a Draft International

   Standard.  IS-IS is of course a major component of intra-domain
   routing today and inspired the development of the OSPF family.
   However, Huitema and Dabbous were not able to give any indication of
   protocol work for Level 3.  There are hints of possible use of
   centralized route servers.

   In the meantime, the NSFnet consortium and the IETF had been
   struggling with the rapid growth of the NSFnet.  It had been clear
   since fairly early on that EGP was not suitable for handling the
   expanding network and the race was on to find a replacement.  EGP is
   'not a routing algorithm' - it provides information about the
   reachability of 'Autonomous Systems' via a common core network.
   There had been some intent to include a metric in EGP to facilitate
   routing decisons, but no agreement could be reached on how to define
   the metric.  The lack of trust was seen as one of the main reasons
   that EGP could not establish a globally acceptable routing metric:
   again this seems to be a clearly futile aim from this distance in
   time!  Consequently EGP became effectively a rudimentary path-vector
   protocol which linked gateways with Autonomous Systems.  It was
   totally reliant on the tree structured network to avoid routing loops
   and the all informed nature of EGP meant that update packets became
   very large.  BGP version 1 [RFC1105] was the first real path-vector
   routing protocol (standardized in 1989) which was intended to relieve
   some of the scaling problems but it still assumed a tree structured
   network.  Routes were described as paths along a 'vector' of ASs
   without any associated cost metric.

   Also the NSFnet was a government funded research and education
   network.  Commercial companies which were partners in some of the
   projects were using the NSFnet for their research activities but it
   was becoming clear that these companies also needed networks for
   commercial traffic.  NSFnet had put in place "acceptable use"
   policies which were intended to limit the use of the network.
   However there was little or no technology to support the legal
   framework.

   Practical experience, IETF IAB discussion and the OSI theoretical
   work were by now coming to the same conclusions:
   o  Networks were going to be composed out of multiple administrative
      domains (the federated network),
   o  The connections between these domains would be an arbitrary graph
      and certainly not a tree,
   o  The administrative domains would wish to establish distinctive,
      independent routing policies through the graph of Autonomous
      Systems, and
   o  Administrative Domains would have a degree of distrust of each
      other which would mean that policies would remain opaque.

   These views were reflected by Susan Hares' (Merit) contribution to
   the Internet Architecture (INARC) workshop in 1989, summarized in the
   report of the workshop [INARC89]:

      The rich interconnectivity within the Internet causes routing
      problems today.  However, the presenter believes the problem is
      not the high degree of interconnection, but the routing protocols
      and models upon which these protocols are based.  Rich
      interconnectivity can provide redundancy which can help packets
      moving even through periods of outages.  Our model of interdomain
      routing needs to change.  The model of autonomous confederations
      and autonomous systems [RFC0975] no longer fits the reality of
      many regional networks.  The ISO models of administrative domain
      and routing domains better fit the current internet's routing
      structure.

      With the first NSFNET backbone, NSF assumed that the Internet
      would be used as a production network for research traffic.  We
      cannot stop these networks for a month and install all new routing
      protocols.  The Internet will need to evolve its changes to
      networking protocols while still continuing to serve its users.
      This reality colors how plans are made to change routing
      protocols.

   It is also interesting to note that the difficulties of organising a
   transition were recognized at this stage.

   Policies would primarily be interested in controlling which traffic
   should be allowed to transit a domain (to satisfy commercial
   constraints or acceptable use policies) thereby controlling which
   traffic uses the resources of the domain.  The solution adopted by
   both the IETF and OSI was a form of distance vector hop-by-hop
   routing with explicit policy terms.  The reasoning for this choice
   can be found in Breslau and Estrin's 1990 paper [Breslau90]
   (implicitly - because some other alternatives are given such as a
   link state with policy suggestion which, with hindsight, would have
   even greater problems than BGP on a global scale network).
   Traditional distance vector protocols exchanged routing information
   in the form of a destination and a metric.  The new protocols
   explicitly associated policy expressions with the route by including
   either a list of the source ASs that are permitted to use the route
   described in the routing update, and/or a list of all ASs traversed
   along the advertised route.

   Parallel protocol developments were already in progress by the time
   this paper was published: BGP version 2 [RFC1163] in the IETF and the
   Inter-Domain Routing Protocol (IDRP) [ISO10747] which would be the
   Level 3 routing protcocol for the OSI architecture.  IDRP was

Internet-Draft                 IDR History                  October 2005


   developed under the aegis of the ANSI XS3.3 working group led by
   Lyman Chapin and Charles Kunzinger.  The two protocols were very
   similar in basic design but IDRP has some extra features, some of
   which have been incorporated into later versions of BGP; others may
   yet be so and still others may be seen to be inappropriate.  Breslau
   and Estrin summarize the design of IDRP as follows:

      IDRP attempts to solve the looping and convergence problems
      inherent in distance vector routing by including full AD
      [Administrative Domain - essentially the equivalent of what are
      now called ASs] path information in routing updates.  Each routing
      update includes the set of ADs that must be traversed in order to
      reach the specified destination.  In this way, routes that contain
      AD loops can be avoided.

      IDRP updates also contain additional information relevant to
      policy constraints.  For instance, these updates can specify what
      other ADs are allowed to receive the information described in the
      update.  In this way, IDRP is able to express source specific
      policies.  The IDRP protocol also provides the structure for the
      addition of other types of policy related information in routing
      updates.  For example, User Class Identifiers (UCI) could also be
      included as policy attributes in routing updates.

      Using the policy route attributes IDRP provides the framework for
      expressing more fine grained policy in routing decisions.
      However, because it uses hop-by-hop distance vector routing, it
      only allows a single route to each destination per-QOS to be
      advertised.  As the policy attributes associated with routes
      become more fine grained, advertised routes will be applicable to
      fewer sources.  This implies a need for multiple routes to be
      advertised for each destination in order to increase the
      probability that sources have acceptable routes available to them.
      This effectively replicates the routing table per forwarding
      entity for each QOS, UCI, source combination that might appear in
      a packet.  Consequently, we claim that this approach does not
      scale well as policies become more fine grained, i.e., source or
      UC1 specific policies.

   Over the next three or four years successive versions of BGP (BGP-2
   [RFC1163], BGP-3 [RFC1267] and BGP-4 [RFC1771], [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp4])
   were deployed to cope with the growing and by now commercialized
   Internet.  BGP version 4 was developed to handle the change from
   classful to classless addressing.  For most of this time IDRP was
   being developed in parallel, and both protocols were implemented in
   the Merit gatedaemon routing protcol suite.  During this time there
   was a movement within the IETF which saw BGP as a stopgap measure to
   be used until the more sophisticated IDRP could be adapted to run

   over IP instead of the OSI connectionless protocol CLNP.  However,
   unlike it's IGP counterpart IS-IS which has stood the test of time,
   and indeed proved to be more flexible than OSPF, IDRP was ultimately
   not adopted by the market.  By the time the NSFnet backbone was
   decommissioned in 1995, BGP-4 was the inter-domain routing protocol
   of choice and OSI's star was already beginning to wane.  IDRP is now
   little remembered.

   A more complete account of the capabilities of IDRP can be found in
   chaper 14 of David Piscitello and Lyman Chapin's book 'Open Systems
   Networking: TCP/IP and OSI' which is now readable on the Internet
   [Chapin94].

   IDRP also contained quite extensive means for securing routing
   exchanges much of it based on X.509 certificates for each router and
   public/private key encryption of routing updates.

   Some of the capabilities of IDRP which might yet appear in a future
   version of BGP include the ability to manage routes with explicit QoS
   classes, and the concept of domain confederations (somewhat different
   from the confederation mechanism in today's BGP) as an extra level in
   the hierarchy of routing.

3.3.  Nimrod Requirements

   Nimrod as expressed by Noel Chiappa in his early document, "A New IP
   Routing and Addressing Architecture" [Chiappa91] and later in the
   NIMROD Working Group documents [RFC1753] and [RFC1992] established a
   number of requirements that need to be considered by any new routing
   architecture.  The Nimrod requirements took RFC1126 as a starting
   point and went further.

   The goals of Nimrod, quoted from [RFC1992], were as follows
   1.  To support a dynamic internetwork of _arbitrary size_ (our
       emphasis) by providing mechanisms to control the amount of
       routing information that must be known throughout an
       internetwork.
   2.  To provide service-specific routing in the presence of multiple
       constraints imposed by service providers and users.
   3.  To admit incremental deployment throughout an internetwork.

   It is certain that these goals should be considered requirements for
   any new domain routing architecture.
   o  As discussed in other sections of this document the amount of
      information needed to maintain the routing system is growing at a
      rate that does not scale.  And yet, as the services and
      constraints upon those services grow there is a need for more
      information to be maintained by the routing system.  One of the



Doria & Davies           Expires April 27, 2006                [Page 24]

Internet-Draft                 IDR History                  October 2005


      key terms in the first requirements is 'control'.  While
      increasing amounts of information need to be known and maintained
      in the Internet, the amounts and kinds of information that are
      distributed can be controlled.  This goal should be reflected in
      the requirements for the future domain architecture.
   o  If anything, the demand for specific services in the Internet has
      grown since 1996 when the Nimrod architecture was published.
      Additionally the kinds of constraints that service providers need
      to impose upon their networks and that services need to impose
      upon the routing have also increased.  Any changes made to the
      network in the last half-decade have not significantly improved
      this situation.
   o  The ability to incrementally deploy any new routing architecture
      within the Internet is still a absolute necessity.  It is
      impossible to imagine that a new routing architecture could
      supplant the current architecture on a flag day

   At one point in time Nimrod, with its addressing and routing
   architectures was seen as a candidate for IPng.  History shows that
   it was not accepted as the IPng, having been ruled out of the
   selection process by the IESG in 1994 on the grounds that it was 'too
   much of a research effort' [RFC1752], although input for the
   requirements of IPng was explicitly solicited from Chiappa [RFC1753].
   Instead IPv6 has been put forth as the IPng.  Without entering a
   discussion of the relative merits of IPv6 versus Nimrod, it is
   apparent that IPv6, while it may solve many problems, does not solve
   the critical routing problems in the Internet today.  In fact in some
   sense it exacerbates them by adding a requirement for support of two
   internet protocols and their respective addressing methods.  In many
   ways the addition of IPv6 to the mix of methods in today's Internet
   only points to the fact that the goals, as set forth by the Nimrod
   team, remain as necessary goals.

   There is another sense in which study of Nimrod and its architecture
   may be important to deriving a future domain routing architecture.
   Nimrod can be said to have two derivatives:
   o  MPLS in that it took the notion of forwarding along well known
      paths
   o  PNNI in that it took the notion of abstracting topological
      information and using that information to create connections for
      traffic.

   It is important to note, that whilst MPLS and PNNI borrowed ideas
   from Nimrod, neither of them can be said to be an implementation of
   this architecture.

   The Private Network-Node Interface (PNNI) was developed under the ATM
   Forum's auspices as a hierarchical route determination protocol for
   ATM, a connection oriented architecture.  It is reputed to have
   developed several of its methods from a study of the Nimrod
   architecture.  What can be gained from an analysis of what did and
   did not succeed in PNNI?

   The PNNI protocol includes the assumption that all peer groups are
   willing to cooperate, and that the entire network is under the same
   top administration.  Are there limitations that stem from this 'world
   node' presupposition?  As discussed in [RFC3221], the Internet is no
   longer a clean hierarchy and there is a lot of resistance to having
   any sort of 'ultimate authority' controlling or even brokering
   communication.

   PNNI is the first deployed example of a routing protocol that uses
   abstract map exchange (as opposed to distance vector or link state
   mechanisms) for inter-domain routing information exchange.  One
   consequence of this is that domains need not all use the same
   mechanism for map creation.  What were the results of this
   abstraction and source based route calculation mechanism?

   Since the authors of this document do not have experience running a
   PNNI network, the comments above are from a theoretical perspective.
   Information on these issues, and any other relevant issues, is
   solicited from those who do have such operational experience.
   Further research is required.

3.5.  Recent Research Work

3.5.1.  Developments in Internet Connectivity

   The work commissioned from Geoff Huston by the Internet Architecture
   Board [RFC3221] draws a number of conclusions from analysis of BGP
   routing tables and routing registry databases:
   o  The connectivity between provider ASs is becoming more like a
      dense mesh than the tree structure that was commonly assumed to be
      commonplace a couple of years ago.  This has been driven by the
      increasing amounts charged for peering and transit traffic by
      global service providers.  Local direct peering and internet
      exchanges are becoming steadily more common as the cost of local
      fibre connections drops.
   o  End user sites are increasingly resorting to multi-homing onto two
      or more service providers as a way of improving resiliency.  This
      has a knock-on effect of spectacularly fast depletion of the
      available pool of AS numbers as end user sites require public AS

      numbers to become multi-homed and corresponding increase in the
      number of prefixes advertised in BGP.
   o  Multi-homed sites are using advertisement of longer prefixes in
      BGP as a means of traffic engineering to load spread across their
      multiple external connections with further impact on the size of
      the BGP tables.
   o  Operational practices are not uniform, and in some cases lack of
      knowledge or training is leading to instability and/or excessive
      advertisement of routes by incorrectly configured BGP speakers.
   o  All these factors are quickly negating the advantages in limiting
      the expansion of BGP routing tables that were gained by the
      introduction of CIDR and consequent prefix aggregation in BGP.  It
      is also now impossible for IPv6 to realize the world view in which
      the default free zone would be limited to perhaps 10,000 prefixes.
   o  The typical 'width' of the Internet in AS hops is now around five,
      and much less in many cases.

   These conclusions have a considerable impact on the requirements for
   the future domain routing architecture:
   o  Topological hierarchy (e.g. mandating a tree structured
      connectivity) cannot be relied upon to deliver scalability of a
      large Internet routing system
   o  Aggregation cannot be relied upon to constrain the size of routing
      tables for an all-informed routing system

3.5.2.  Defending the End To End Principle

   DARPA funded a project to think about a new architecture for future
   generation Internet, called NewArch (http://www.isi.edu/newarch/).
   Work started in the first half of 2000 and the main project finished
   in 2003.
      Editor's Note: The next version of this document will contain
      additional material on the results of this project and its impact
      on the requirements for inter-domain routing.

   The main development so far is to conclude that as the Internet
   becomes mainstream infrastructure, fewer and fewer of the
   requirements are truly global but may apply with different force or
   not at all in certain parts of the network.  This (it is claimed)
   makes the compilation of a single, ordered list of requirements
   deeply problematic.  Instead we may have to produce multiple
   requirement sets with support for differing requirement importance at
   different times and in different places.  This 'meta-requirement'
   significantly impacts architectural design.

   Potential new technical requirements identified so far include:

Internet-Draft                 IDR History                  October 2005


   o  Commercial environment concerns such as richer inter-provider
      policy controls and support for a variety of payment models
   o  Trustworthiness
   o  Ubiquitous mobility
   o  Policy driven self-organisation ('deep auto configuration')
   o  Extreme short-time-scale resource variability
   o  Capacity allocation mechanisms
   o  Speed, propagation delay and Delay/BandWidth Product issues

   Non-technical or political 'requirements' include:
   o  Legal and Policy drivers such as
      *  Privacy and free/anonymous speech
      *  Intellectual property concerns
      *  Encryption export controls
      *  Law enforcement surveillance regulations
      *  Charging and taxation issues
   o  Reconciling national variations and consistent operation in a
      world wide infrastructure

   One of the participants in this work (Dave Clark) with one of his
   associates has also published a very interesting paper analyzing the
   impact of some of these new requirements on the end-to-end principle
   that has guided the development of the Internet to date
   [Blumenthal01].  Their primary conclusion is that the loss of trust
   between the users at the ends of end to end has the most fundamental
   effect on the Internet.  This is clear in the context of the routing
   system, where operators are unwilling to reveal the inner workings of
   their networks for commercial reasons.  Similarly, trusted third
   parties and their avatars (mainly mid-boxes of one sort or another)
   have a major impact on the end-to-end principles and the routing
   mechanisms that went with them.  Overall, the end to end principles
   should be defended so far as is possible - some changes are already
   too deeply embedded to make it possible to go back to full trust and
   openness - at least partly as a means of staving off the day when the
   network will ossify into an unchangeable form and function (much as
   the telephone network has done).  The hope is that by that time a new
   Internet will appear to offer a context for unfettered innovation.


4.  Existing problems of BGP and the current EGP/IGP Architecture

   Although most of the people who have to work with BGP today believe
   it to be a useful, working protocol, discussions have brought to
   light a number of areas where BGP or the relationship between BGP and
   the IGPs in use today could be improved.  This section is, to a large
   extent, a wish list for the future domain routing architecture based
   on those areas where BGP is seen to be lacking, rather than simply a
   list of problems with BGP.  The shortcomings of today's inter-domain



Doria & Davies           Expires April 27, 2006                [Page 28]

Internet-Draft                 IDR History                  October 2005


   routing system have also been extensively surveyed in 'Architectural
   Requirements for Inter-Domain Routing in the Internet' [RFC3221],
   particularly with respect to its stability and the problems produced
   by explosions in the size of the Internet.

4.1.  BGP and Auto-aggregation

   The stability and later linear growth rates of the number of routing
   objects (prefixes) that was achieved by the introduction of CIDR
   around 1994, has now been once again been replaced by near-
   exponential growth of number of routing objects.  The granularity of
   many of the objects advertised in the default free zone is very small
   (prefix length of 22 or longer): This granularity appears to be a by-
   product of attempts to perform precision traffic engineering related
   to increasing levels of multi-homing.  At present there is no
   mechanism in BGP that would allow an AS to aggregate such prefixes
   without advance knowledge of their existence, even if it was possible
   to deduce automatically that they could be aggregated.  Achieving
   satisfactory auto-aggregation would also significantly reduce the
   non-locality problems associated with instability in peripheral ASs.

   On the other hand, it may be that alterations to the connectivity of
   the net as described in [RFC3221] and Section 2.5.1 may limit the
   usefulness of auto-aggregation

4.2.  Convergence and Recovery Issues

   BGP today is a stable protocol under most circumstances but this has
   been achieved at the expense of making the convergence time of the
   inter-domain routing system very slow under some conditions.  This
   has a detrimental effect on the recovery of the network from
   failures.

   The timers that control the behavior of BGP are typically set to
   values in the region of several tens of seconds to a few minutes,
   which constrains the responsiveness of BGP to failure conditions.

   In the early days of deployment of BGP, poor network stability and
   router software problems lead to storms of withdrawals closely
   followed by re-advertisements of many prefices.  To control the load
   on routing software imposed by these 'route flaps', route flap
   damping was introduced into BGP.  Most operators have now implemented
   a degree of route flap damping in their deployments of BGP.  This
   restricts the number of times that the routing tables will be rebuilt
   even if a route is going up and down very frequently.  Unfortunately,
   the effect of route flap damping is exponential in its behavior that
   can result in some parts of the Internet being inaccessible for hours
   at a time.



Doria & Davies           Expires April 27, 2006                [Page 29]

Internet-Draft                 IDR History                  October 2005


   There is evidence ([RFC3221] and our own measurements [Jiang02]) that
   in today's network route flap is disproportionately associated with
   the fine grain prefices (length 22 or longer) associated with traffic
   engineering at the periphery of the network.  Auto-aggregation as
   previously discussed would tend to mask such instability and prevent
   it being propagated across the whole network.  Another question that
   needs to be studied is the continuing need for an architecture that
   requires global convergence.  Some of our studies (yet to be
   published) show that, in some localities at least, the network never
   actually reaches stability; i.e. never really globally converges.
   Can a global, and beyond, network be designed with the requirement of
   global convergence?

4.3.  Non-locality of Effects of Instability and Misconfiguration

   There have been a number of instances, some of which are well
   documented of a mistake in BGP configuration in a single peripheral
   AS propagating across the whole Internet and resulting in misrouting
   of most of the traffic in the Internet.

   Similarly, route flap in a single peripheral AS can require route
   table recalculation across the entire Internet.

   This non-locality of effects is highly undesirable, and it would be a
   considerable improvement if such effects were naturally limited to a
   small area of the network around the problem.  This is another
   argument for an architecture that does not require global
   convergence.

4.4.  Multihoming Issues

   As discussed previously, the increasing use of multi-homing as a
   robustness technique by peripheral ASs requires that multiple routes
   have to be advertised for such domains.  These routes must not be
   aggregated close in to the multi-homed domain as this would defeat
   the traffic engineering implied by multi-homing and currently cannot
   be aggregated further away from the multi-homed domain due to the
   lack of auto-aggregation capabilities.  Consequentially the default
   free zone routing table is growing exponentially, as it was before
   CIDR.

   The longest prefix match routing technique introduced by CIDR, and
   implemented in BGP-4, when combined with provider address allocation
   is an obstacle to effective multi-homing if load sharing across the
   multiple links is required: If an AS has been allocated its addresses
   from an upstream provider, the upstream provider can aggregate those
   addresses with those of other customers and need only advertise a
   single prefix for a range of customers.  But, if the customer AS is



Doria & Davies           Expires April 27, 2006                [Page 30]

Internet-Draft                 IDR History                  October 2005


   also connected to another provider, the second provider is not able
   to aggregate the customer addresses because they are not taken from
   his allocation, and will therefore have to announce a more specific
   route to the customer AS.  The longest match rule will then direct
   all traffic through the second provider, which is not as required.

   Example:


                    \       /
                   AS1     AS2
                      \   /
                       AS3


   AS3 has received its addresses from AS1, which means AS1 can
   aggregate.  But if AS3 want its traffic to be seen equally both ways,
   AS1 is forced to announce both the aggregate and the more specific
   route to AS3.

   Figure 1: Address Aggregation

   This problem has induced many ASs to apply for their own address
   allocation even though they could have been allocated from an
   upstream provider further exacerbating the default free zone route
   table size explosion.  This problem also interferes with the desire
   of many providers in the default free zone to route only prefixes
   that are equal to or shorter than 20 or 19 bits.

   Note that some problems which are referred to as multihoming issues
   are not and should not solvable through the routing system (e.g.
   where a TCP load distributor is needed), and multihoming is not a
   panacea for the general problem of robustness in a routing system
   [I-D.berkowitz-multirqmt].

4.5.  AS-number exhaustion

   The domain identifier or AS-number is a 16-bit number.  When this
   paper was originally written in 2001, allocation of AS-numbers was
   increasing 51% a year [RFC3221] and exhaustion by 2005 was predicted.
   According to some recent work by again by Huston [Huston05], the rate
   of increase dropped off after the business downturn but as of July
   2005, well over half the available AS numbers (39000 out of 64510)
   have been allocated and around 20000 are visible in the global BGP
   routing tables.  The rate of allocation is currently about 3500 per
   year.  Depending on the curve fitting model used to predict when
   exhaustion will occur, the pool will run out somewhere between 2010
   and 2013.  There appear to be other factors at work in this rate of



Doria & Davies           Expires April 27, 2006                [Page 31]

Internet-Draft                 IDR History                  October 2005


   increase beyond an increase in the number of ISPs in business,
   although there is a fair degree of correlation between these numbers.
   AS numbers are now used for a number of purposes beyond that of
   identifying large routing domains: multihomed sites acquire an AS
   number in order to express routing preferences to their various
   providers and AS numbers are used part of the addressing mechanism
   for MPLS/BGP-based virtual private networks (VPNs) [RFC2547].  The
   IETF has had a proposal under development for over four years to
   increase the available range of AS-numbers to 32 bits [I-D.ietf-idr-
   as4bytes].  Much of the slowness in development is due to the
   deployment challenge during transition.  Because of the difficulties
   of transition, deployment needs to start well in advance of actual
   exhaustion so that the network as a whole is ready for the new
   capability when it is needed.  This implies that standardisation
   needs to be complete and implementations available at least one
   equipment replacement cycle in advance of expected exhaustion so that
   deployement should be starting around 2008.

4.6.  Partitioned AS's

   Tricks with discontinuous ASs are used by operators, for example, to
   implement anycast.  Discontinuous ASs may also come into being by
   chance if a multi-homed domain becomes partitioned as a result of a
   fault and part of the domain can access the Internet through each
   connection.  It may be desirable to make support for this kind of
   situation more transparent than it is at present.

4.7.  Load Sharing

   Load splitting or sharing was not a goal of the original designers of
   BGP and it is now a problem for today's network designers and
   managers.  Trying to fool BGP into load sharing between several links
   is a constantly recurring exercise for most operators today.  Traffic
   engineering extensions to the future domain routing architecture that
   will facilitate load sharing should be considered.

4.8.  Hold down issues

   As with the interval between 'hello' messages in OSPF, the typical
   size and defined granularity (seconds to tens of seconds) of the
   'keep-alive' time negotiated at start-up for each BGP connection
   constrains the responsiveness of BGP to link failures.

   The recommended values and the available lower limit for this timer
   were set to limit the overhead caused by keep-alive messages when
   link bandwidths were typically much lower than today.  Analysis and
   experiment ([I-D.alaettinoglu-isis-convergence], [I-D.sandiick-flip]
   & [I-D.lang-mpls-lmp]) indicate that faster links could sustain a



Doria & Davies           Expires April 27, 2006                [Page 32]

Internet-Draft                 IDR History                  October 2005


   much higher rate of keep-alive messages without significantly
   impacting normal data traffic.  This would improve responsiveness to
   link and node failures but with a corresponding increase in the risk
   of instability, if the error characteristics of the link are not
   taken properly into account when setting the keep-alive interval.

   An additional problem with the hold-down mechanism in BGP is the
   amount of information that has to be exchanged to re-establish the
   database of route advertisements on each side of the link when it is
   re-established after a failure.  Currently any failure, however brief
   forces a full exchange which could perhaps be constrained by
   retaining some state across limited time failures and using revision
   control, transaction and replication techniques to re-synchonise the
   databases.  Various techniques have been implemented to try to reduce
   this problem but they have not yet been standardised.

4.9.  Interaction between Inter domain routing and intra domain routing

   Today, many operators' backbone routers run both I-BGP and an IGP
   maintain the routes that reach between the borders of the domain.
   Exporting routes from BGP into IGP and bringing them back up to BGP
   is not recommended [RFC2791], but it is still necessary for all
   backbone routers to run both protocols.  BGP is used to find the
   egress point and IGP to find the path (next hop router) to the egress
   point across the domain.  This is not only a management problem but
   may also create other problems:
   o  BGP is a distance vector protocol, as compared with most IGPs,
      which are link state protocols, and as such it is not optimised
      for convergence speed although they generally require less
      processing power.  Incidentally, more efficient distance vector
      algorithms are available such as [Xu97].
   o  The metrics used in BGP and the IGP are rarely comparable or
      combinable.  Whilst there are arguments that the optimizations
      inside a domain may be different from those for end-to-end paths,
      there are occasions, such as calculating the 'topologically
      nearest' server when computable or combinable metrics would be of
      assistance.
   o  The policies that can be implemented using BGP are designed for
      control of traffic exchange between operators, not for controlling
      paths within a domain.  Policies for BGP are most conveniently
      expressed in RPSL and this could be extended if thought desirable
      to include additional policy information.
   o  If the NEXT HOP destination for a set of BGP routes becomes
      inaccessible because of IGP problems, the routes using the
      vanished next hop have to be invalidated at the next available
      UPDATE.  Subsequently, if the next hop route reappears, this would
      normally lead to the BGP speaker requesting a full table from its
      neighbour(s).  Current implementations may attempt to circumvent



Doria & Davies           Expires April 27, 2006                [Page 33]

Internet-Draft                 IDR History                  October 2005


      the effects of IGP route flap by caching the invalid routes for a
      period in case the next hop is restored.
   o  Synchronization between IGP and EGP is a problem as long as we use
      different protocols for IGP and EGP, which will most probably be
      the case even in the future because of the differing requirements
      in the two situations.  Some sort of synchronization between those
      two protocols would be useful.  In the draft 'OSPF Transient
      Blackhole Avoidance' [I-D.mcpherson-ospf-transient], the IGP side
      of the story is covered.
   o  Synchronizing in BGP means waiting for the IGP to know about the
      same networks as the EGP, which can take a significant period of
      time and slows down the convergence of BGP by adding the IGP
      convergence time into each cycle.

4.10.  Policy Issues

   There are several classes of issue with current BGP policy:
   o  Policy is installed in an ad-hoc manner in each autonomous system.
      There isn't a method for ensuring that the policy installed in one
      router is coherent with policies installed in other routers.
   o  As described in Griffin [Griffin99] and in McPherson
      [I-D.mcpherson-bgp-route-oscillation] it is possible to create
      policies for ASs, and instantiate them in routers, that will cause
      BGP to fail to converge in certain types of topology
   o  There is no available network model for describing policy in a
      coherent manner.

   Policy management is extremely complex and mostly done without the
   aid of any automated procedures.  The extreme complexity means that a
   highly qualified specialist is required for policy management of
   border routers.  The training of these specialists is quite lengthy
   and needs to involve long periods of hands-on experience.  There is,
   therefore, a shortage of qualified staff for installing and
   maintaining the routing policies.  Because of the overall complexity
   of BGP, policy management tends to be only a relatively small topic
   within a complete BGP training course and specialised policy
   management training courses are not generally available.

4.11.  Security Issues

   While many of the issues with BPG security have been traced either to
   implementation issues or to operational issues, BGP is vulnerable to
   DDOS attacks.  Additionally routers can be used as unwitting
   forwarders in DDOS attacks on other systems.

   Though DDOS attacks can be fought in a variety of ways, most
   filtering methods, it is takes constant vigilance.  There is nothing
   in the current architecture or in the protocols that serves to



Doria & Davies           Expires April 27, 2006                [Page 34]

Internet-Draft                 IDR History                  October 2005


   protect the forwarders from these attacks.

4.12.  Support of MPLS and VPNS

   Recently BGP has been modified to function as a signaling protocol
   for MPLS and for VPNs [RFC2547].  Some people see this over-loading
   of the BGP protocol as a boon whilst others see it as a problem.
   While it was certainly convenient as a vehicle for vendors to deliver
   extra functionality for to their products, it has exacerbated some of
   the performance and complexity issues of BGP.  Two important problems
   are, the additional state that must be retained and refreshed to
   support VPN tunnels and that BGP does not provide end-to-end
   notification making it difficult to confirm that all necessary state
   has been installed or updated.

   In creating the future domain routing architecture, serious
   consideration must be given to the argument that VPN signaling
   protocols should remain separate from the route determination
   protocols.

4.13.  IPv4 / IPv6 Ships in the Night

   The fact that service providers need to maintain two completely
   separate networks; one for IPv4 and one for IPv6 has been a real
   hindrance to the introduction of IPv6.  When IPv6 does get widely
   deployed it will do so without causing the disappearance of IPv4.
   This means that unless something is done, service providers would
   need to maintain the two networks in, relative, perpetuity.

   It is possible to use a single set of BGP speakers with multiprotocol
   extensions [RFC2858] to exchange information about both IPv4 and IPv6
   routes between domains, but the use of TCP as the transport protocol
   for the information exchange results in an asymmetry when choosing to
   use one of TCP over IPv4 or TCP over IPv6.  Successful information
   exchange confirms one of IPv4 or IPv6 reachability between the
   speakers but not the other, making it possible that reachability is
   being advertised for a protocol for which it is not present.

   Also, current implementations do not allow a route to be advertised
   for both IPv4 and IPv6 in the same UPDATE message, because it is not
   possible to explicitly link the reachability information for an
   address family to the corresponding next hop information.  This could
   be improved, but currently results in independent UPDATEs being
   exchanged for each address family.

4.14.  Existing Tools to Support Effective Deployment of Inter-Domain
       Routing

Internet-Draft                 IDR History                  October 2005


   The tools available to network operators to assist in configuring and
   maintaining effective inter-domain routing in line with their defined
   policies are limited, and almost entirely passive.

   o  There are no tools to facilitate the planning of the routing of a
      domain (either intra- or inter-domain); there are a limited number
      of display tools that will visualize the routing once it has been
      configured
   o  There are no tools to assist in converting business policy
      specifications into the RPSL language; there are limited tools to
      convert the RPSL into BGP commands and to check, post-facto, that
      the proposed policies are consistent with the policies in adjacent
      domains (always provided that these have been revealed and
      accurately documented).
   o  There are no tools to monitor BGP route changes in real time and
      warn the operator about policy inconsistencies and/or
      instabilities.

   The following section summarises the tools that are available to
   assist with the use of RPSL.  Note they are all batch mode tools used
   off-line from a real network.  These tools will provide checks for
   skilled inter-domain routing configurers but limited assistance for
   the novice.

4.14.1.  Routing Policy Specification Language RPSL (RFC 2622, 2650) and
         RIPE NCC Database (RIPE 157)

   Routing Policy Specification Language RPSL enables a network operator
   to describe routes, routers and autonomous systems ASs that are
   connected to the local AS.

   Using the RPSL language a distributed database is created to describe
   routing policies in the Internet as described by each AS
   independently.  The database can be used to check the consistency of
   routing policies stored in the database.

   Tools exist (RIPE 81, 181, 103) that can be applied on the database
   to answer requests of the form, e.g.
   o  Flag when two neighboring network operators specify conflicting or
      inconsistent routing information exchanges with each other and
      also detect global inconsistencies where possible;
   o  Extract all AS-paths between two networks that are allowed by
      routing policy from the routing policy database; display the
      connectivity a given network has according to current policies.

   The database queries enable a partial static solution to the
   convergence problem.  They analyze routing policies of very limited
   part of Internet and verify that they do not contain conflicts that

   could lead to protocol divergence.  The static analysis of
   convergence of the entire system has exponential time complexity, so
   approximation algorithms would have to be used.


5.  Security Considerations

   As this is an informational draft on the history of requirements in
   IDR and on the problems facing the current Internet IDR architecture,
   it does not as such create any security problems.  On the other hand,
   some of the problems with today's Internet routing architecture do
   create security problems and these have been discussed in the text
   above.


6.  Acknowledgments

   The draft is derived from work originally produced by Babylon.
   Babylon was a loose association of individuals from academia, service
   providers and vendors whose goal was to discuss issues in Internet
   routing with the intention of finding solutions for those problems.

   The individual members who contributed materially to this draft are:
   Anders Bergsten, Howard Berkowitz, Malin Carlzon, Lenka Carr
   Motyckova, Elwyn Davies, Avri Doria, Pierre Fransson, Yong Jiang,
   Dmitri Krioukov, Tove Madsen, Olle Pers, and Olov Schelen.

   Thanks also go to the members of Babylon and others who did
   substantial reviews of this material.  Specifically we would like to
   acknowledge the helpful comments and suggestions of the following
   individuals: Loa Andersson, Tomas Ahlstrom, Erik Aman, Thomas
   Eriksson, Niklas Borg, Nigel Bragg, Thomas Chmara, Krister Edlund,
   Owe Grafford, Torbjorn Lundberg, Jasminko Mulahusic, Florian-Daniel
   Otel, Bernhard Stockman, Tom Worster, Roberto Zamparo.

   In addition, the authors are indebted to the folks who wrote all the
   references we have consulted in putting this paper together.  This
   includes not only the references explicitly listed below, but also
   those who contributed to the mailing lists we have been participating
   in for years.

   Finally, it is the editors who are responsible for any lack of
   clarity, any errors, glaring omissions or misunderstandings.
