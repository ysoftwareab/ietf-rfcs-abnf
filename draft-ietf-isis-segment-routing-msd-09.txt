             Signaling MSD (Maximum SID Depth) using IS-IS
                 draft-ietf-isis-segment-routing-msd-09

Abstract

   This document defines a way for an IS-IS Router to advertise multiple
   types of supported Maximum SID Depths (MSDs) at node and/or link
   granularity.  Such advertisements allow entities (e.g., centralized
   controllers) to determine whether a particular SID stack is
   supportable in a given network.  This document only defines one type
   of MSD (maximum label imposition) - but defines an encoding which can
   support other MSD types.

1.  Introduction

   When Segment Routing(SR) paths are computed by a centralized
   controller, it is critical that the controller learns the Maximum SID
   Depth(MSD) which can be imposed at the node/link a given SR path is
   applied so as to insure that the SID stack depth of a computed path
   doesn't exceed the number of SIDs the node is capable of imposing.

   PCEP SR extensions draft [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing] signals MSD
   in SR PCE Capability TLV and METRIC Object.  However, if PCEP is not
   supported/configured on the head-end of a SR tunnel or a Binding-SID
   anchor node and controller does not participate in IGP routing, it
   has no way to learn the MSD of nodes and links which has been
   configured.  BGP-LS [RFC7752] defines a way to expose topology and
   associated attributes and capabilities of the nodes in that topology
   to a centralized controller.  MSD signaling by BGP-LS has been
   defined in [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-ls-segment-routing-msd].  Typically,
   BGP-LS is configured on a small number of nodes, that do not
   necessarily act as head-ends.  In order, for BGP-LS to signal MSD for
   all the nodes and links in the network MSD is relevant, MSD

   capabilites should be advertised to every IS-IS router in the
   network.

   Other types of MSD are known to be useful.  For example,
   [I-D.ietf-isis-mpls-elc] defines Readable Label Depth Capability
   (RLDC) that is used by a head-end to insert Entropy Label (EL) at
   appropriate depth, so it could be read by transit nodes.

   This document defines an extension to IS-IS used to advertise one or
   more types of MSD at node and/or link granularity.  It also creates
   an IANA registry for assigning MSD type identifiers.  It also defines
   one MSD type called Base MPLS Imposition MSD.  In the future it is
   expected that new MSD types will be defined to signal additional
   capabilities e.g., entropy labels, SIDs that can be imposed through
   recirculation, or SIDs associated with another dataplane e.g., IPv6.

2.  Node MSD Advertisement

   A new sub-TLV "Node MSD sub-TLV" is defined within the body of the
   IS-IS Router Capability TLV [RFC7981], to carry the provisioned
   MSD(s) of the router originating the Router Capability TLV.  Node MSD
   is the lowest MSD supported by the node on any interface.  MSD values
   may be learned via a hardware API or may be provisioned.

         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


                        Figure 1: Node MSD Sub-TLV

   The Type (1 byte) of this sub-TLV has value of 23.

   Length is variable (minimum of 2, multiple of 2 octets) and
   represents the total length of value field.

   Value field consists of one or more pairs of a 1 octet MSD-Type (IANA
   Registry) and 1 octet Value.

   Node MSD value is a number in the range of 0-255. 0 represents lack
   of the ability to support SID stack of any depth; any other value
   represents that of the node.  This value MUST represent the lowest
   value supported by any link associated with the node.

   This sub-TLV is optional.  The scope of the advertisement is specific
   to the deployment.

3.  Link MSD Advertisement

   A new sub-TLV - Link MSD sub-TLV is defined for TLVs 22, 23, 141,
   222, and 223 to carry the MSD of the interface associated with the
   link.  MSD values may be learned via a hardware API or may be
   provisioned.

                        Figure 2: Link MSD Sub-TLV

   The Type (1 byte) of this sub-TLV has value of 15.

   Length is variable (minimum of 2, multiple of 2 octets) and
   represents the total length of value field.

   Value field consists of one or more pairs of a 1 octet MSD-Type (IANA
   Registry) and 1 octet Value.

   Link MSD value is a number in the range of 0-255. 0 represents lack
   of the ability to support SID stack of any depth; any other value
   represents that of the link when used as an outgoing link.

   This sub-TLV is optional.  The scope of the advertisement is specific
   to the deployment.

4.  Using Node and Link MSD Advertisements

   When Link MSD is present for a given MSD type, the value of the Link
   MSD MUST be used in preference to the Node MSD.

   The meaning of the absence of both Node and Link MSD advertisements
   for a given MSD type is specific to the MSD type.  Generally it can
   only be inferred that the advertising node does not support
   advertisement of that MSD type.  However, in some cases the lack of
   advertisement might imply that the functionality associated with the
   MSD type is not supported.  The correct interpretation MUST be
   specified when an MSD type is defined.

5.  Base MPLS Imposition MSD

   Base MPLS Imposition MSD (BMI-MSD) signals the total number of MPLS
   labels a node is capable of imposing, including any service/transport
   labels.

   Absence of BMI-MSD advertisements indicates only that the advertising
   node does not support advertisement of this capability.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to allocate a sub-TLV type code for the
   new sub TLV proposed in Section 2 of this document from IS-IS Router
   Capability TLV Registry as defined by [RFC7981].

   The following value has been allocated by IANA:


      Value     Description                      Reference
      -----     ---------------                  -------------

                            Figure 3: Node MSD

   This document requests IANA to allocate a sub-TLV type code as
   defined in Section 3 from Sub-TLVs for TLVs 22, 23, 141, 222 and 223
   registry.

   The following value has been allocated by IANA:


      Value     Description                      Reference
      -----     ---------------                  -------------
