<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)
            allows an organization to take responsibility for a message, in a
            way that can be validated by a recipient. The organization can be
            the author's, the originating sending site, an intermediary, or
            one of their agent's. DKIM defines a domain-level digital
            signature authentication framework for email, using public-key
            cryptography and key server technology. This permits verifying the
            signer of a message, as well as the integrity of its contents.
            DKIM accomplishes this by defining a domain-level authentication
            framework for email using public-key cryptography and key server
            technology <a class='info' href='#RFC4871'>[RFC4871]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Allman, E., Callas, J., Delany, M., Libbey, M., Fenton, J., and M. Thomas, &ldquo;DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) Signatures,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>. This permits verifying a
            message source, an intermediary, or one of their agents, as well
            as the integrity of its contents. DKIM will also provide a
            mechanism that permits potential email signers to publish
            information about their email signing practices; this will permit
            email receivers to make additional assessments of unsigned
            messages. Such protection of email identity can assist in the
            global control of "spam" and "phishing". This document provides an
            overview of the DKIM service and describes how it can fit into a
            messaging service. It also describes how DKIM relates to other
            IETF message signature technologies. It is intended for those who
            are adopting, developing, or deploying DKIM.

Introduction</h3>

<p>DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) allows an organization to take
            responsibility for a message, in a way that can be validated by a
            recipient. The organization can be the author's, the originating
            sending site, an intermediary, or one of their agent's. DKIM
            defines a domain-level digital signature authentication framework
            for email, using public-key cryptography and key server
            technology. This permits verifying the signer of a message, as
            well as the integrity of its contents. DKIM accomplishes this by
            defining a domain-level authentication framework for email using
            public-key cryptography and key server technology <a class='info' href='#RFC4871'>[RFC4871]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Allman, E., Callas, J., Delany, M., Libbey, M., Fenton, J., and M. Thomas, &ldquo;DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) Signatures,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>. This permits verifying a message source,
            an intermediary, or one of their agents, as well as the integrity
            of its contents. DKIM will also provide a mechanism that permits
            potential email signers to publish information about their email
            signing practices; this will permit email receivers to make
            additional assessments of unsigned messages.
            Such protection of email identity can assist in the global
            control of "spam" and "phishing". 
</p>
<p> This document provides a description of DKIM's architecture and
            functionality. It is intended for those who are adopting,
            developing, or deploying DKIM. It also will be helpful for those
            who are considering extending DKIM, either into other areas of use
            or to support additional features. This Overview does not provide
            information on threats to DKIM or email, or details on the
            protocol specifics, which can be found in <a class='info' href='#RFC4871'>[RFC4871]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Allman, E., Callas, J., Delany, M., Libbey, M., Fenton, J., and M.

The document
            assumes a background in basic network security technology and
            services. 
</p>
<p> Neither this document nor DKIM attempt to provide solutions to
            the world's problems with spam, phishing, virii, worms, joe jobs,
            etc. DKIM provides one basic tool, in what needs to be a large
            arsenal, for improving basic trust in the Internet mail service.
            However by itself, DKIM is not sufficient to that task and this
            Overview does not pursue the issues of integrating DKIM into these
            larger efforts, beyond a simple reference within a system diagram.
            Rather, it is a basic introduction to the technology and its use.

Prior Work</h3>

<p>Historical email assessment based on identity has
               used the IP Address of a system that
               sent the message. The Address is obtained via underlying
               Internet information mechanisms and is therefore trusted to be
               accurate. Besides having some known security weaknesses, the
               use of Addresses present a number of functional and operational
               problems. Consequently there is an industry desire to use a
               more stable value that has better correspondence to
               organizational boundaries. Domain Names are viewed as
               often satisfying this need.
</p>
<p> There have been four previous efforts at standardizing an
               Internet email signature scheme: </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) was first published in 1987.
                        <a class='info' href='#RFC0989'>[RFC0989]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Linn, J. and IAB Privacy Task Force, &ldquo;Privacy enhancement for Internet electronic mail: Part I: Message encipherment and authentication procedures,&rdquo; February&nbsp;1987.</span><span>)</span></a>
                  
</li>
<li>PEM eventually transformed into MIME Object Security
                     Services (MOSS) in 1995. <a class='info' href='#RFC1848'>[RFC1848]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Crocker, S., Galvin, J., Murphy, S., and N. Freed, &ldquo;MIME Object Security Services,&rdquo; October&nbsp;1995.</span><span>)</span></a> Today,
                     these two are only of historical interest.
</li>
<li> Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) was developed by Phil
                     Zimmermann and first released in 1991. <a class='info' href='#RFC1991'>[RFC1991]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Atkins, D., Stallings, W., and P. Zimmermann, &ldquo;PGP Message Exchange Formats,&rdquo; August&nbsp;1996.</span><span>)</span></a> A later version was standardized
                     as OpenPGP. <a class='info' href='#RFC2440'>[RFC2440]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Callas, J., Donnerhacke, L., Finney, H., and R. Thayer, &ldquo;OpenPGP Message Format,&rdquo; November&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a>
                     <a class='info' href='#RFC3156'>[RFC3156]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Elkins, M., Del Torto, D., Levien, R., and T. Roessler, &ldquo;MIME Security with OpenPGP,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a>
                     <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-openpgp-rfc2440bis'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;openpgp&#8209;rfc2440bis]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Callas, J., &ldquo;OpenPGP Message Format,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>
                  
</li>
<li>RSA Security independently developed Secure MIME (S/MIME)
                     to transport a PKCS #7 data object. <a class='info' href='#RFC3851'>[RFC3851]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ramsdell, B., &ldquo;Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) Version 3.1 Message Specification,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>
</li>
</ul><p> Development of S/MIME and OpenPGP
               has continued. While both have
               achieved a significant user base, neither have achieved
               ubiquity in deployment or use, and their goals differ from
               those of DKIM. 
</p>
<p> To the extent that other message-signing services might have
               been adapted to do the job that DKIM is designed to perform, it
               was felt that re-purposing any of those would be more
               problematic than creating a separate service. That said, DKIM
               uses security algorithm components that have a long history,
               including use within some of those other messaging security
               services. 
</p>
<p> DKIM has a distinctive approach for distributing and vouching
               for keys. It uses a key-centric Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
               rather than the more typical approaches based on a certificate
               in the styles of Kohnfelder (X.509) or Zimmermann (web of
               trust). For DKIM, the owner of a key asserts its validity,
               rather than relying on the key having a broader semantic
               implication of the assertion, such as a quality assessment of
               the key's owner. DKIM treats quality assessment as an
               independent, value-added service, beyond the initial work of
               deploying a verifying signature service. 
</p>
<p> Further, DKIM's PKI is provided by adding
               information records to the existing
               Domain Name System (DNS) <a class='info' href='#RFC1034'>[RFC1034]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Mockapetris, P., &ldquo;Domain names - concepts and facilities,&rdquo; November&nbsp;1987.</span><span>)</span></a>, rather than
               requiring deployment of a new query infrastructure. This
               approach has significant operational advantages. First, it
               avoids the considerable barrier of creating a new 
               global infrastructure; hence it leverages a global base of
               administrative experience and highly reliable distributed
               operation. Second, the technical aspect of the DNS is already
               known to be efficient. Any new service would have to undergo a
               period of gradual maturation, with potentially problematic
               early-stage behaviors. By (re-)using the DNS, DKIM avoids these
               growing pains.

Internet Mail Background</h3>

<p>Internet Mail has a simple split between the user world, in the
            form of Mail User Agents (MUA), and the transmission world, in the
            form of the Mail Handling Service (MHS) composed of Mail Transfer
            Agents (MTA). The MHS is responsible for accepting a message from
            one user, the author, and delivering it to one or more other
            users, the recipients. This creates a virtual MUA-to-MUA exchange
            environment. The first component of the MHS is called the Mail
            Submission Agent (MSA) and the last is called the Mail Delivery
            Agent (MDA).
</p>
<p> An email Mediator is both an inbound MDA and outbound MSA. It
            takes delivery of a message and re-posts it for further
            distribution, retaining the original From header field. A mailing
            list is a common example of a Mediator
</p>
<p>The modern Internet Mail service is marked by many independent
            operators, many different components for providing users with
            service and many other components for performing message transfer.
            Consequently, it is necessary to distinguish administrative
            boundaries that surround sets of functional components, which are
            subject to coherent operational policies.
</p>
<p>As elaborated on below, every MSA is a
            candidate for signing using DKIM, and every MDA is a candidate for
            doing DKIM verification.

Administrative Management Domain (ADMD)</h3>

<p>Operation of Internet Mail services is apportioned to different
               providers (or operators). Each can be composed of an
               independent ADministrative Management Domain (ADMD). An ADMD
               operates with an independent set of policies and interacts with
               other ADMDs according to differing types and amounts of trust.
               Examples include: an end-user operating their desktop client
               that connects to an independent email service, a department
               operating a submission agent or a local Relay, an
               organization's IT group that operates enterprise Relays, and an
               ISP operating a public shared email service. 
</p>
<p>Each of these can be configured into many combinations of
               administrative and operational relationships, with each ADMD
               potentially having a complex arrangement of functional
               components. <a class='info' href='#ADMD'>Figure&nbsp;1<span> (</span><span class='info'>ADministrative Management Domains (ADMD) Example</span><span>)</span></a> depicts the relationships
               among ADMDs. Perhaps the most salient aspect of an ADMD is the
               differential trust that determines its policies for activities
               within the ADMD, versus those involving interactions with other
               ADMDs. 
</p>
<p>Basic types of ADMDs include: </p>

<p>Note that Transit services are quite different from
                  packet-level transit operation. Whereas end-to-end packet
                  transfers usually go through intermediate routers, email
                  exchange across the open Internet is often directly between
                  the Edge ADMDs, at the email level.

               candidates for doing DKIM verification.  
</p>
<p>The distinction between Transit network and Edge network
               transfer services is primarily significant because it
               highlights the need for concern over interaction and protection
               between independent administrations. The interactions between
               functional components within a single ADMD are subject to the
               policies of that domain. Although any pair of ADMDs
               can arrange for whatever policies they wish, Internet Mail is
               designed to permit inter-operation without prior arrangement.

DKIM Placement within an ADMD</h3>

<p>It is expected that the most common venue for a DKIM
               implementation will be within the infrastructures of the
               originating organization's outbound service and the receiving
               organization's inbound service, such as a department or a
               boundary MTA. DKIM can be implemented in an author's or
               recipient MUA, but this is expected to be less typical, since
               it has higher administration and support costs.
</p>
<p>A Mediator, such as a mailing list, often can re-post a message
               without breaking the DKIM signature. Furthermore it can add its
               own signature. This can be added by the Mediator software
               itself, or by any outbound component in the Mediator's ADMD.

<a name="rfc.section.3"></a><h3>3.&nbsp;
The DKIM Value Proposition</h3>

<p>The nature and origins of a message are often falsely stated. As a
            foundation for distinguishing legitimate mail, DKIM provides a
            means of associating a verifiable identity with a message. Given
            the presence of that identity, a receiver can make decisions about
            further handling of the message, based upon assessments of that
            identity.
</p>
<p>Receivers who successfully verify a signature can use information
            about the signer as part of a program to limit spam, spoofing,
            phishing, or other undesirable behavior. DKIM does not, itself,
            prescribe any specific actions by the recipient; rather it is an
            enabling technology for services that do. 
</p>
<p>These services will typically: </p>
<ol class="text">
<li>Verify an identity
</li>
<li>Determine whether the identity is known or unknown
</li>
<li>Determine whether a known identity is trusted
</li>
</ol><p> The role of DKIM is in the first two of these; DKIM is an
            enabler for the third. 
</p>
<p>An attack is made against an organization or against customers of
            an organization. The name of the organization is linked to
            particular Internet domain names. One point of leverage used by
            attackers is either to use a legitimate domain name,
            without authorization or to use a
            "cousin" name that is similar to one that is legitimate, but is
            not controlled by the target organization. A DKIM-based
            assessment service can enforce a basic
            separation between domains used by such known organizations and
            domains used by others.
</p>
<p>DKIM signatures can be created by a direct handler of a message,
            either as its originator or as an intermediary. It can also be
            created by an independent service, providing assistance to a
            handler of the message. Whoever does the signing chooses the
            domain name to be used as the basis for later assessments. Hence,
            reputation associated with that domain name is the basis for
            evaluating whether to trust the message for delivery. The owner of
            the domain name being used for a DKIM signature is declaring that
            they are accountable for the message. 
</p>
<p>DKIM is a value-added feature for
            email. Mail that is not signed by DKIM is handled in the same way
            as it was, before DKIM was defined; it continues to be evaluated
            by established analysis and filtering techniques. Over time,
            widespread DKIM adoption could permit more strict handling of
            messages that are not signed. However early benefits do not
            require this and probably do not warrant this.
</p>
<p>It is important to be clear about the narrow scope of DKIM's
            capabilities. It is an enabling technology, intended for use in
            the larger context of determining message legitimacy. This larger
            context is complex, so it is easy to assume that
            a component like DKIM, which actually provides only a limited
            service, instead satisfies the broader set of requirements. A DKIM
            signature: </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Does not offer any assertions about the behaviors of the
                  identity doing the signing. 
</li>
<li>Does not prescribe any specific actions for receivers to
                  take upon successful signature verification. 
</li>
<li>Does not provide protection after signature verification. 
</li>
<li>Does not protect against re-sending (replay of) a message
                  that already has a verified signature; therefore a transit
                  intermediary or a recipient can re-post the message in such
                  a way that the signature would remain verifiable, although
                  the new recipient(s) would not have been specified by the
                  author.

                  department. An existing Internet service construct that
                  enables this granularity is the Domain Name <a class='info' href='#RFC1034'>[RFC1034]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Mockapetris, P., &ldquo;Domain names - concepts and facilities,&rdquo; November&nbsp;1987.</span><span>)</span></a>, to which the signing key record is
                  bound. Further DKIM signing and/or validating can be
                  implemented anywhere along the transit path, rather than
                  only in the end systems or only in the boundary MTA.

                  DKIM needs to support signing by any of these different

                  name that they deem appropriate (and for which they are
                  authorized.) As an example an organization that creates
                  email content often delegates portions of its processing or
                  transmission to an outsourced group. DKIM supports this mode
                  of activity, in a manner that is not visible to end users.

                  mechanisms and meanings are independent of this core
                  service. One such mechanism might assert a relationship

                  that a message definitely came from example.com does not
                  threaten the anonymity of the user who authored it, if it is
                  still possible to obtain effectively anonymous accounts at

Treat verification failure the same as no signature present.</h3>

<p>OpenPGP and S/MIME were designed for
                  strong cryptographic protection. This included treating
                  verification failure as message failure. As a sub-goal to
                  the requirement for transparency, a DKIM signature verifier
                  is to treat messages with signatures that fail as if they
                  were unsigned. Hence the message will revert to normal
                  handling, through the receiver's existing filtering
                  mechanisms. Thus, DKIM specifies that a sender is not to take a message that has a broken
                  signature and treat it any differently than if
                  the signature weren't there.

Make signatures transparent to non-supporting recipients.</h3>

<p>S/MIME and OpenPGP modify the message
                  body. Hence, their presence is potentially visible to email
                  recipients, whose user software needs to process the associated
                  constructs. In order to facilitate incremental adoption,
                  DKIM is designed to be transparent to recipients that do not
                  support it. A DKIM signature does not "get in the way" for such
                  recipients.

Permit incremental adoption for incremental benefit.</h3>

<p>DKIM can immediately provide benefits between any two
                  organizations that exchange email and implement DKIM. In the
                  usual manner of "network effects", the benefits of DKIM
                  increase dramatically as its adoption increases.
</p>
<p>Although it is envisioned that this mechanism will call upon
                  independent services to aid in the assessment of DKIM
                  results, they are not essential in order to obtain initial
                  benefit. For example DKIM allows (possibly large) pair-wise
                  sets of email providers and spam filtering companies to
                  distinguish mail that is associated with a known
                  organization, from mail that might deceptively purport to
                  have the affiliation. This in turn allows the development of
                  &quot;whitelist&quot; schemes whereby authenticated
                  mail from a known source with good reputation is allowed to
                  bypass some anti-abuse filters.
</p>
<p>In effect the email receiver is using their set of known
                  relationships to generate their own reputation data. This
                  works particularly well for traffic between large sending
                  providers and large receiving providers. However it also
                  works well for any operator, public or private, that has
                  mail traffic dominated by exchanges among a stable set of
                  organizations.

Minimize the amount of required infrastructure</h3>

<p>A new service, or an enhancement to an existing service,
                  requires adoption by some number of systems, before it can
                  be useful. The greater the number of required adopters, the
                  higher the adoption barrier. This becomes particularly
                  serious when adoption is required by intermediary -- that
                  is, infrastructure -- service providers. In order to allow
                  early adopters to gain early benefit, DKIM makes no changes
                  to the core Internet Mail service and, instead, can provide
                  a useful benefit for any signer/verifier pair of
                  participants exchanging mail. Similarly, DKIM's reliance on
                  the Domain Name System greatly reduces the amount of new
                  administrative infrastructure that is need, across the open
                  Internet.

DKIM Function</h3>

<p>DKIM has a very constrained set of capabilities, primarily

            information with a message, especially a responsible identity.
            When a message is not signed, DKIM will permit the domain name of the author to be used for
            obtaining information about their signing practices.

<a name="rfc.section.5.1"></a><h3>5.1.&nbsp;
The Basic Signing Service</h3>

<p>With the DKIM signature mechanism, a signer chooses a signing
               identity based on their domain name, performs digital signing
               on the message, and records signature information in a DKIM
               header field. A verifier obtains the domain name and the
               &quot;selector&quot; from the DKIM header field,
               queries for a public key associated with the name, and verifies
               the signature.
</p>
<p>DKIM permits any domain name to be used for signing, and
               supports extensible choices for various algorithms. As is
               typical for Internet standards, there is a core set of
               algorithms that all implementations are required to support, in
               order to guarantee basic interoperability.
</p>
<p>DKIM permits restricting the use of a signature key to
               signing messages for particular types
               of services, such as only for email. This is helpful when
               delegating signing authority, such as to a particular
               department or to a third-party outsourcing service.
</p>
<p>With DKIM the signer explicitly lists the headers that are
               signed. By choosing the minimal set of headers needed, the
               signature is likely to be considerably more robust against the
               handling vagaries of intermediary MTAs.

Characteristics of a DKIM signature</h3>

<p>A DKIM signature covers the message body and selected header
               fields. The signer computes a hash of the selected header
               fields and another hash of the body. The signer then uses a
               private key to cryptographically encode this information, along
               with other signing parameters. Signature information is placed
               into a new <a class='info' href='#RFC2822'>[RFC2822]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Resnick, P., &ldquo;Internet Message Format,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a> header field of the

<a name="rfc.section.5.3"></a><h3>5.3.&nbsp;
The Selector construct</h3>

<p>The key for a signature is associated
               with a domain name, as specified in the d= DKIM-Signature header field
               parameter. That domain name is the complete identity used for
               making assessments about the signer. However this name is not
               sufficient for making a DNS query to obtain the key needed to
               verify the signature. 
</p>
<p>A single domain can use multiple signing keys and/or multiple
               signers. To support this, DKIM identifies a particular
               signature as a combination of the domain name and an added
               field, called the "selector", coded into separate
               DKIM-Signature header field parameters. 
</p>
<p>
               </p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>NOTE:  </dt>
<dd>The selector is not intended to be
                     part of the domain name that is used for making
                     assessments. Rather, the selector is strictly reserved
                     for use in administering keys that are associated with
                     the domain name. If the selector becomes part of a name
                     assessment mechanism, then there is no remaining
                     mechanism for making a transition from an old, or
                     compromised, key to a new one.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote><p>
            
</p>
<p>Signers often need to support multiple assessments about their
               organization, such as to distinguish one type of message from
               another, or one portion of the organization from another. To
               permit assessments that are independent, one method is for an
               organization to use different sub-domains in the "d="
               parameter, such as "transaction.example.com" versus
               "newsletter.example.com", or "productA.example.com" versus
               "productB.example.com".

Verification</h3>

<p>After a message has been signed, any agent in the message
               transit path can verify the signature, to determine that the
               signing identity took responsibility for the message. Message
               recipients can verify the signature by querying the DNS for the
               signer's domain directly, to retrieve the appropriate public
               key, and thereby confirm that the message was attested to by a
               party in possession of the private key for the signing domain.
               Typically, verification will be done by an agent in the ADMD of
               the message recipient.

Signing</h3>

<p>Signing can be performed by a component of the ADMD that
               creates the message, and/or within any ADMD along the relay
               path. The signer uses the appropriate private key.

Verifying</h3>

<p>Verification can be performed by any functional component along
               the relay and delivery path. Verifiers retrieve the public key
               based upon the parameters stored in the message.

Unverified or Unsigned Mail</h3>

<p>Note that a failed signature causes the message to be treated
               in the same manner as one that is unsigned. Messages lacking a
               valid originator signature (a signature associated with the
               originator of the message as opposed to a signature associated
               with an intermediary) prompt a query for any published "sender
               practices" information, as an aid in determining whether the
               sender information has been used without authorization.

Evaluating</h3>

<p>The Figure shows the verified identity as being used to assess
               an associated reputation, but it could be applied for other
               tasks, such as management tracking of mail. A popular use of
               reputation information is as input to a filtering engine that
               decides whether to deliver -- and possibly whether to specially
               mark -- a message. Filtering engines have become complex and
               sophisticated. Their details are outside of DKIM's scope, other
               than the expectation that DKIM-related information is added to
               the varied soup of rules used by the engines. The rules can
               cover signed messages and can deal with unsigned messages from
               a domain, if the domain has published information about is
               practices
