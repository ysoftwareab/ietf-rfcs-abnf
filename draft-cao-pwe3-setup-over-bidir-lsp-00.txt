Abstract 

   In MPLS and MPLS-TE environments pseudo wires use two unidirectional 
   LSPs as PSN tunnels, the two PEs select LSP tunnels independently. In 
   contrast the MPLS-TP environment supports both bidirectional and 
   unidirectional LSPs and PWE may, therefore, use bidirectional LSPs as 
   PSN tunnels.   

   In order to use MPLS-TP bidirectional LSPs as a PSN tunnels for 
   pseudo wires some modification of the pseudowire signaling procedures

Internet-Draft   Setup of Pseudowires over bi-dir LSP     October 2008 
 
    
  1. Introduction 

   The requirements for Transport Network have been discussed in ITU-T 
   for a number of years and a set of T-MPLS documents has been 
   published. With the progress of the IETF and ITU-T Join Work Team 
   (JWT), IETF will design a series of protocol based on current MPLS 
   technology to meet T-MPLS requirement. The solution is called MPLS-TP.  

   One significant change brought about by MPLS-TP is that LSPs may be 
   bi-directional. Bi-directional LSPs have many advantages compared to 
   traditional unidirectional LSP particularly since most of the upper 
   layer services that will use them are bi-directional. Because most of 
   the current application protocols are designed to use unidirectional 
   LSPs, some adaptations are required when bi-directional LSPs are 
   introduced. Pseudo wire is the most important application for MPLS-TP. 
   This draft describes the necessary LDP extensions and signaling 
   procedures to allow migration of PW service from traditional MPLS 
   network to MPLS-TP enabled transport network.  

  1.1. Motivations and scenarios 

   Pseudo Wire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) is a mechanism to emulate a 
   number of layer 2 services, such as ATM, Frame Relay or Ethernet, etc. 
   Such services are emulated between two ACs and the PW encapsulated 
   layer 2 service payload is carried by PSN tunnels between PEs. Today 
   PWE3 generally uses two reverse unidirectional LDP/RSVP-TE LSPs as 
   PSN tunnels. The possibility of asymmetric routing of the reverse 
   LSPs and the lack of effective OAM mechanisms make it hard for 
   unidirectional LSPs to meet the high QOS requirement of emulated 
   layer 2 services. MPLS-TP is designed for transport networks and 
   provides bi-directional LSPs which guarantee symmetric routing of 
   both directions of the LSP. PWE3 is believed to be one of the most 
   important applications for MPLS-TP.  

   In the current architecture the two PW PEs select LSPs independently, 
   the only requirement being that the LSP selected terminates on the 
   'other' PE. There is no architectural provision or requirement to 
   associate a pseudowire with a PSN tunnel. In contrast, when bi-
   directional MPLS-TP LSPs are available and we want to run a PW over 
   one of them, the PEs must make sure they select the same LSP for the 
   PW; this is especially true when there are multiple bi-directional 
   LSPs between the two PEs One possible method is binding the PSN 
   tunnel manually at each PE but this is prone to configuration 
   mistakes and it is difficult to maintain a large number of PWs in 
   such a manner. To allow for minimal manual intervention and 
   configuration, this draft discusses an automatic solution by 
   extending FEC 128/129 based on [RFC4447].

  1.2. Scope of this document 

   This document discusses LDP extensions to allow automatic signaling 
   support for deployment of a large number of PWs. Static configuration 
   is operator/vendor specific and is not discussed here.  

   There are two types of PW defined in IETF: single segment PW and 
   multi-segment PW. This document will cover both types of PW.  

   As previously stated the original motivation for this work was a 
   recognition that the MPLS-TP bi-directional LSP is essentially 
   unusable by PWE application without extensions to the signaling 
   mechanisms. We now believe that the LSP selection mechanism described 
   here may be useful in existing MPLS networks and for other 
   applications in addition to PWE. We will address these scenarios in a 
   future version of this document. 

   The method proposed in this draft is based on [RFC4447] and does not 
   modify existing pseudowire or LSP constructs. 

  2. Applicability Statement  

   Migration from existing MPLS PWE3 networks to MPLS-TP enabled 
   networks will occur over an extended period and it is important to 
   keep the new solution as compatible as possible with existing 
   solutions. In keeping with PW architecture, we wish to minimize the 
   modification of or extensions to current protocols.  

  2.1. SS-PW architecture 

   Figure 1 illustrates the reference model derived from [RFC3985] which 
   supports single segment PW emulated services. PEs (PE1 and PE2) 
   provide one or more PWs for their CEs (CE1 and CE2) to enable the 
   client CEs to communicate over the PSN. The PSN network uses Bi-
   directional MPLS-TP LSP to provide a data path for the PW service.  

   In this model both PE1 and PE2 both support bi-directional LSPs. It 
   is important for higher layer services to be able choose the same bi-
   directional LSP at both PEs. This is a problem when one or more LSP 
   exist between them; multiple LSPs may be used to provide different 
   levels of QOS or provide protection. 

   As an example, when PE1 expects to setup the PW on a bi-directional 
   LSP; it chooses a bi-directional LSP for the PW, and then sends a 
   Label Mapping message to PE2. Because there is currently no mechanism 
   for PE2 to learn the bi-directional LSP information (or indeed any

   unidirectional LSP information), from the mapping message, it may 
   choose another bi-directional LSP for the same PW. With this 
   restriction different bi-directional LSPs could be selected for one 
   PW by the two PEs. Similar problem can occur if unidirectional LSP 
   coexists with MPLS-TP bi-directional LSP.

2.2. MS-PW architecture 

   Figure 2 extends the SS-PW architecture to show a multi-segment case. 
   The PEs that provide PW to CE1 and CE2 are Terminating-PE1 (T-PE1) 
   and Terminating-PE2 (T-PE2) respectively. The PE that joints PW 
   segment 1 and segment 2 is called Switching-PE1 (SPE1). It is assumed 
   that TPE1 and TPE2 need to setup PW segments on bi-directional LSPs. 
   For PW segment 1, S-PE1 does not know which bi-directional LSP is 
   selected by T-PE1. As a consequence S-PE1 may select another bi-
   directional LSP or a unidirectional LSP for the reverse path to T-PE1. 
   For PW segment 2, the similar issues arise between SPE-1 and TPE-2.

                      Figure 2: MS-PW Reference Model 
    
   The key point of our solution is to eliminate the problems 
   illustrated above, we do this by enabling the target PE to learn the 
   bi-directional LSP selected by the Mapping sender. 

  3. LDP Extensions 

   Before sending a Label Mapping message to setup a PW, PE has selects 
   a bi-directional LSP for the PW. We introduce a bi-directional LSP 
   TLV to allow the identity of this bi-directional LSP to be 
   communicated to the target PE.  

  3.1. Bi-directional LSP TLV 

   The bi-directional LSP TLV specifies a bi-directional LSP which is 
   selected by the sending PE. This TLV is contained in a Generalized PW 
   FEC (FEC129) or PW ID FEC (FEC128) and sent to the target PE in the 
   Label Mapping message. Note that sending the bi-directional LSP TLV 
   is OPTIONAL, but the target PE must process the TLV upon reception. 

   The proposed format of the bi-directional LSP TLV is as follows:

   - Variable Length Value  

   In an MPLS-TP network, a bi-directional LSP established by RSVP-TE 
   signaling can be identified using a SESSION object and a 
   SENDER_TEMPLATE object, see [RFC3209]. The SESSION object carries the 
   tunnel destination IP address and the tunnel ID to identify a tunnel. 
   The SENDER_TEMPLATE object carries the source IP address of the 
   tunnel and the LSP ID to identify a LSP. This document specifies the 
   following Variables to be included in LSP TLV; their meanings are 
   same in SESSION object and SENDER_TEMPLATE object: 

       - LSP ID  

       - Tunnel ID  

       - IPv4/IPv6 tunnel Extended ID (optional) 

       - IPv4/IPv6 tunnel end point address  

       - IPv4/IPv6 tunnel sender address  

   To identify an IPv4 tunnel, following Variables should be included in 
   the bi-directional LSP TLV: < LSP ID, Tunnel ID, IPv4 tunnel end 
   point address, IPv4 tunnel sender address >. In order to indicate a 
   globally unique tunnel, IPv4 Extended Tunnel ID may also be used. 

   To identify an IPv6 tunnel, following variables should be included in 
   the bi-directional LSP TLV: < LSP ID, Tunnel ID, IPv6 tunnel end 
   point address, IPv6 tunnel sender address>. In order to indicate a 
   globally unique tunnel, IPv6 Extended Tunnel ID may also be used. 

  4. SS-PW Signaling Procedures 

   PE1 and PE2, known as "LDP Peers", use Label Mapping messages to 
   exchange PW information with each other. Depending on the role they 
   play in the selection of a bi-directional LSP, we identify two types 
   of PEs: 

   a) Active PE: the PE which initiates the selection of a bi-
      directional LSP and informs the remote PE; 

   b) Passive PE: the PE which obeys the active PE's suggestion 

   If the two PEs both assume the active role in signaling an LSP for 
   the same PWE then competition (a signaling collision) occurs. In this

   case, the two PEs should obey a predefined rule to decide which bi-
   directional LSP will be used,  

  4.1. Active/Passive PE Signaling Procedure 

  4.1.1. Active PE Signaling Procedure 

   Before sending the Mapping Message, the active PE, say PE1, must 
   select a bi-directional LSP for the PW. This indicates that PW will 
   be carried through the selected bi-directional LSP tunnel. PE1 
   generates a "bi-directional LSP TLV" that identifies the selected LSP 
   and sends a Mapping message containing it to the passive PE, in this 
   case PE2. 

  4.1.2. Passive PE Signaling Procedure 

   When a Label Mapping message carrying a bi-directional LSP TLV is 
   received by PE2 it may decide, based on local policy and/or success 
   or failure in matching the LSP to accept or reject it.  

   If the bi-directional LSP cannot be matched successfully or if local 
   policy prohibits its acceptance, a Label Release message must be sent, 
   with an "Unassigned/Unrecognized bi-directional LSP" code, and the 
   processing of the Label Mapping message is complete. 

   If the bi-directional LSP proposed by PE1 is accepted by PE2 then PE2 
   attempts setup of the PW in the opposite (PE2->PE1) direction. If PE2 
   has not already signaled for the opposite direction, it sends a Label 
   Mapping message to PE1, with a "bi-directional LSP TLV" that 
   identifies the same bi-directional LSP, proposed by PE1, that it has 
   accepted for this PW.  

   If PE1 receives a Label Mapping message in which "bi-directional LSP" 
   is equal to the bi-directional LSP it selected then both directions 
   of the PW are setup. 

   4.2. Active/Active PE Signaling Procedure 

   Sometimes, before PE2 receives the Label Mapping message, it has 
   already sent a Label Mapping message to PE1. If the bi-directional 
   LSP in the received message from PE1 is as same as it was in the 
   message sent by PE2 then the signaling has converged on an mutually 
   agreed LSP and is completed. Otherwise, when the bi-directional LSP 
   selected by PE1 differs from the LSP selected by PE2, PE1 and PE2 
   have to make a choice between two LSPs. In this case both PE1 and PE2 
   have assumed 'active' roles and they must have the capability to 
   resolve this contention. In this case PE1 and PE2 will compare the 
   node ID in the received mapping messages with their own node ID. ,

   carry PW.
