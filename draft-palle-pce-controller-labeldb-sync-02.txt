       LABEL-DB Synchronization Procedures for a PCE as a central
                           controller(PCECC)
               draft-palle-pce-controller-labeldb-sync-02

Abstract

   PCE as a central controller specifies the procedures and PCEP
   protocol extensions where LSPs are calculated/setup/initiated and
   label forwarding entries are downloaded through a centralized PCE
   server to each network devices along the LSP path while leveraging
   the existing PCE technologies as much as possible.

   Labels downloaded to forwarding entries requires a reliable
   synchronization mechanism between the path computation clients (PCCs)
   and the PCE.  The basic mechanism for label database (LABEL-DB
   synchronization is part of the PCE as a central controller
   specification.  This document presents motivations for optimizations
   to the LABEL-DB synchronization and the corresponding PCEP procedures
   and extensions.

Internet-Draft                LABEL-DB-SYNC                 October 2017


1.  Introduction

   [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller] specify the
   procedures and PCEP protocol extensions for using the PCE as the
   central controller [I-D.ietf-teas-pce-central-control] and user cases
   where LSPs are calculated/setup/initiated/downloaded through
   extending the existing PCE architectures and PCEP.

   [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller] and
   [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-pce-controller-sr] specifies reliable
   synchronization mechanism between the path computation clients (PCCs)
   and the PCECC.

   This draft specify the optimizations for LABEL-DB synchronization and
   the corresponding PCEP procedures and extensions.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  LABEL-DB Synchronization

   PCECC MUST maintains the LABEL-DB for each PCEP session separately.
   The purpose of LABEL-DB synchronization is to make sure that the
   PCECC's view of LABEL-DB matches with the PCC's LABEL-DB.  The LABEL-
   DB synchronization MUST be performed from PCECC to PCC immediately
   after the LSP state synchronization.  [RFC8231] describes the basic
   mechanism for LSP state synchronization.  [RFC8233] describes the
   optimizations for LSP state synchronization.

   Full LABEL-DB synchronization performed from PCECC to PCC on Initial
   session UP or every session flap is described in
   [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller] and
   [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-pce-controller-sr].

   Providing an Optimizations for LABEL-DB synchronization can result in
   significant savings in both control-plane data exchanges and the time
   it takes for the PCC to become fully operational.

   Optimizations for LABEL-DB synchronization describes the need that
   both PCEP speakers support label database version capability and
   maintain label database version for each session.  See Section 3 for
   detail procedures.

   [Editor's Note: [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller]
   defines new messages PCLabelUpd and PCLabelRpt.  Questions where
   raised on the need for the new messages.  Further appendix in
   [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller] and
   [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-pce-controller-sr] describes how the
   existing messages can be extended to add this functionality.  WG
   needs to decide the final direction i.e. new specific messages are
   needed or existing PCEP messages can be extended.  The optimization
   procedure would need to be modified based on the above decision.]

3.  Optimizations for LABEL-DB Synchronization

   This section add some of the optimization mechanisms for LABEL-DB
   synchronization.  By default, the full LABEL-DB synchronization is
   performed.

3.1.  LABEL-DB Synchronization Avoidance Procedure

   The LABEL-DB synchronization MAY be skipped following a PCEP session
   restart if there is no change in the LABEL-DB of the session at
   PCECC, during the period prior to session re-initialization.  To be
   able to make this determination, labels must be exchanged and
   maintained by both PCECC and PCC during normal operation.  This is
   accomplished by keeping track of the changes to the label database,
   using a version tracking field called the Label Database Version
   Number.

   The Label Database Version Number, carried in LABEL-DB-VERSION TLV
   (see Section 4.3), is owned by a PCECC and it MUST be incremented by
   1 for each successive change in the PCECC's label database.  The
   Label Database Version Number MUST start at 1 and may wrap around.
   Values 0 and 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF are reserved.  If either of the two
   values are used during LABEL-DB synchronization, the PCC speaker
   receiving this node should send back a PCErr with Error-type TBD1
   Error-value 3 'Received an invalid Label Database Version Number',
   and close the PCEP session.  Operations that trigger a change to the
   Label database include an addition or deletion of labels that would
   trigger a label update to the PCC.

   LABEL-DB synchronization avoidance is advertised on a PCEP session
   during session startup using the INCLUDE-LABEL-DB-VERSION (I) bit in
   the PCECC capability TLV (see Section 4.2).  The PCEP peer MAY
   include the SPEAKER-ENTITY-ID TLV described in [RFC8233] in the OPEN
   message to identify the peer in case of IP address change.

   If both PCEP speakers set the I flag in the OPEN object's PCECC
   Capability TLV to 1, the PCECC MUST include the LABEL-DB-VERSION TLV
   in each LABEL object of the PCLabelUpd message.  If the LABEL-DB-

Internet-Draft                LABEL-DB-SYNC                 October 2017


   VERSION TLV is missing in a PCLabelUpd message, the PCC will generate
   an error with Error-Type 6 (mandatory object missing) and Error-Value
   TBD2 'LABEL-DB-VERSION TLV missing' and close the session.  If LABEL-
   DB synchronization avoidance has not been enabled on a PCEP session,
   the PCECC SHOULD NOT include the LABEL-DB-VERSION TLV in the LABEL
   Object and the PCC SHOULD ignore it were it to receive one.

   If a PCC's label database survived the restart of a PCEP session, the
   PCC will include the LABEL-DB-VERSION TLV in its OPEN object, and the
   TLV will contain the last Label Database Version Number received on
   an Label Update from the PCECC in the previous PCEP session.  If a
   PCECC's Label Database survived the restart of a PCEP session, the
   PCECC will include the LABEL-DB-VERSION TLV in its OPEN object and
   the TLV will contain the latest Label Database Version Number.  If a
   PCEP speaker's label database did not survive the restart of a PCEP
   session, the PCEP speaker MUST NOT include the LABEL-DB-VERSION TLV
   in the OPEN object.

   If both PCEP speakers include the LABEL-DB-VERSION TLV in the OPEN
   Object and the TLV values match, the PCECC MAY skip LABEL-DB
   synchronization.  Otherwise, the PCECC MUST perform full LABEL-DB
   synchronization ([I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller] and
   [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-pce-controller-sr]) or incremental
   LABEL-DB synchronization (see Section 3.2) to the PCC, Incase, the
   PCECC attempts to skip LABEL-DB synchronization, by setting the SYNC
   Flag to 0 on the first Label Update from the PCECC, the PCC MUST send
   back a PCErr with Error-type TBD1 (Label Database Synchronization
   Error) and Error-value 4(Label Database Version mismatch), and close
   the PCEP session.

   If LABEL-DB synchronization is required, then prior to completing the
   initialization phase, the PCC MUST mark any labels in the label
   database that were previously updated by the PCECC as stale.  When
   the PCECC updates a label during LABEL-DB synchronization, if the
   label already exists in the label database, the PCC MUST update the
   label database and clear the stale marker from the label.  When it
   has finished LABEL-DB synchronization, the PCECC MUST immediately
   send an end of synchronization marker.  The end of synchronization
   marker is a Path Computation Label Update (PCLabelUpd) message with a
   SRP object containing the SYNC flag set to 0 (see Section 4.1) and
   Label as 0 in the LABEL object.  The LABEL-DB-VERSION TLV MUST be
   included in this PCLabelUpd message.  On receiving this Label Update,
   the PCC MUST report all the labels in the label database that are
   still marked as stale to PCECC.

   Note that a PCECC/PCC MAY force LABEL-DB synchronization by not
   including the LABEL-DB-VERSION TLV in its OPEN object.

               Figure 2: LABEL-DB synchronization Performed

   Figure 3 shows an example sequence where the LABEL-DB synchronization
   is skipped, but because one or both PCEP speakers set the I Flag to
   0, the PCECC does not send LABEL-DB-VERSION TLVs in subsequent
   PCLabelUpd messages to the PCC.  If the current PCEP session
   restarts, the PCEP speakers will have to perform full LABEL-DB
   synchronization, since the PCC does not know the PCECC's latest Label
   Database Version Number information.

                              sent from PCECC

3.2.  Incremental LABEL-DB Synchronization Procedure

   If a PCC restarts and its label database survived, PCECC with
   mismatched Label Database Version Number will send all their Labels
   information (full LABEL-DB) to the PCC, even if only a small number
   of changes happened.  It can take a long time and consume large
   communication channel bandwidth.

   This section extends the idea to only synchronize the delta (changes)
   in case of Label Database Version Number of both PCEP peers is non-
   zero and mismatch.

   If both PCEP speakers include the LABEL-DB-VERSION TLV in the OPEN
   object and the LABEL-DB-VERSION TLV values match, the PCECC MAY skip
   LABEL-DB synchronization.  Otherwise, the PCECC MUST perform LABEL-DB
   synchronization.  Incremental label database synchronization
   capability is advertised on a PCEP session during session startup
   using the DELTA-LABEL-SYNC-CAPABILITY (D) bit in the capabilities TLV
   (see Section 4.2).  Instead of dumping full LABEL-DB to the PCC
   again, the PCECC synchronizes the delta (changes) as described in
   Figure 4 when D flag and I flag is set to 1 by both PCC and PCECC.
   Other combinations of D and I flags setting by PCC and PCECC result
   in full LABEL-DB synchronization procedure as described in

              Figure 4: Incremental Synchronization Procedure

   As per Section 3.1, the Label Database Version Number is incremented
   each time a change is made to the PCECC's label database.  Each label
   is associated with the DB version at the time of its addition.  This
   is needed to determine which label and what information needs to be
   synchronized in incremental LABEL-DB synchronization.

   It is not necessary for a PCECC to store a complete history of label
   database change, but rather remember the labels (including label
   addition and deletion) that happened between the PCEP session(s)
   restart in order to carry out incremental LABEL-DB synchronization.
   After the synchronization procedure finishes, the PCECC can dump this

   history information.  In the example shown in Figure 4, the PCECC
   needs to store the label changes that happened between DB Version 35
   to 39 and synchronizes these changes only when performing incremental
   label update.  So a PCECC needs to remember at least the label
   changes that happened after an existing PCEP session with a PCC goes
   down to have any chance of doing incremental synchronization when the
   session is re-established.

   If a PCECC finds out it does not have sufficient information to
   complete incremental synchronization after advertising incremental
   LABEL-DB synchronization capability, it MUST send a PCErr with Error-
   Type TBD1 and Error-Value 5 'A PCECC indicates to a PCC that it can
   not complete the LABEL-DB synchronization' and terminate the session.
   The PCECC SHOULD re-establish the session with the D bit set to 0 in
   the OPEN message.

   The other procedures and error checks remain unchanged from the
   default LABEL-DB synchronization defined in
   [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller] and
   [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-pce-controller-sr].

4.  PCEP Extensions

4.1.  Extension of SRP object

   SRP object extension for SYNC flag to specify the LABEL-DB
   synchronization operation is defined in
   [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller].

4.2.  Extension of PCECC Capability TLV

   PCECC Capability TLV is defined in
   [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller].  This draft defines
   a new 'INCLUDE-LABEL-DB-VERSION' flag (I bit) to specify the label
   database version capability and 'DELTA-LABEL-SYNC-CAPABILITY' to
   specify the incremental label database synchronization capability.

   The TLV format is as per [RFC5440].  The format of the PCECC
   Capability TLV is shown Figure 5:

   I (INCLUDE-LABEL-DB-VERSION - 1 bit): if set to 1 by both PCEP
   Speakers, the PCECC will include the LABEL-DB-VERSION TLV in each
   LABEL Object.

   D (DELTA-LABEL-SYNC-CAPABILITY - 1 bit): if set to 1 by a PCEP
   speaker, it indicates that the PCEP speaker allows incremental
   (delta) LABEL-DB synchronization.

4.3.  New LABEL-DB-VERSION TLV

   The Label Database Version Number (LABEL-DB-VERSION) TLV is an
   optional TLV that MAY be included in the OPEN object and the LABEL
   object.

   The TLV format is as per [RFC5440].  The format of the LABEL-DB-
   VERSION TLV is shown in the following figure:

                   Figure 6: LABEL-DB-VERSION TLV format

   The type of the TLV is [TBD3] and it has a fixed length of 8 octets.
   The value contains a 64-bit unsigned integer, representing the Label
   Database Version Number.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  PCEP TLV Type Indicators

   IANA is requested to confirm the early allocation of the following
   TLV Type Indicator values within the "PCEP TLV Type Indicators" sub-
   registry of the PCEP Numbers registry, and to update the reference in
   the registry to point to this document, when it is an RFC:

            Value          Meaning               Reference
            [TBD]          LABEL-DB-VERSION TLV  This document

5.2.  PCECC-CAPABILITY TLV

   [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller] defines the PCECC-
   CAPABILITY TLV and [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-pce-controller-sr]
   extends this TLV to add PCECC-SR-CAPABILITY.

   Requests that IANA creates a registry to manage the value of the new
   PCECC-CAPABILITY TLV's Flag field.  IANA is requested to allocate a
   new bits in the PCECC-CAPABILITY TLV Flag Field registry, as follows:

       Bit            Description                     Reference
       30             I (INCLUDE-LABEL-DB-VERSION )   This document

6.  Manageability Considerations

   All manageability requirements and considerations listed in
   [RFC5440], [RFC8231] and
   [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller] apply to PCEP
   protocol extensions defined in this document.  In addition,
   requirements and considerations listed in this section apply.

6.1.  Control of Function and Policy

6.2.  Information and Data Models

6.3.  Liveness Detection and Monitoring

6.4.  Verify Correct Operations

6.5.  Requirements On Other Protocols
