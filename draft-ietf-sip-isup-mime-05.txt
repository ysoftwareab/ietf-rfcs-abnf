Abstract

This document describes MIME types for application/ISUP and 
application/QSIG objects for use in SIP applications, according to 
the rules defined in RFC 2048 [1].  These types can be used to identify 
ISUP and QSIG objects within a SIP message such as INVITE or INFO, 
as might be implemented when using SIP between legacy systems.

1. Introduction

ISUP (ISDN User part) defined in the ITU-T recommendations 
Q.761-4 is a signaling protocol used between telephony switches. 
There exists a need to transport ISUP-encoded signaling 
information between SIP entities as part of the payload of SIP 
[2] messages, in order to access ISUP-based legacy service 
logic.  For example, this may be implemented when using SIP to 
control sessions between two systems that support legacy 
telephony services or gateway between legacy systems.  

QSIG is the analogous signaling protocol used between private 
branch exchanges to support calls within private telephony 
networks.  There is a similar need to transport QSIG-encoded 
signaling information between SIP entities to support legacy 
services or gateway between legacy systems.

Internet Draft     ISUP and QSIG/MIME types           Oct 2000

The following discussion is specific to this usage and would not 
apply to the transportation of ISUP or QSIG messages in other 
applications. These media types are intended for ISUP or QSIG 
application information that is used within the context of a SIP 
session, and not as general purpose transport of SCN signaling.  

The definition of media types for ISUP and QSIG application 
information does not address fully how the entities exchanging 
messages determine  or negotiate compatibility.  It is assumed 
that this is addressed by alternative means such as 
configuration or routing protocols.  

This is intended to be an IETF approved MIME type, and to be 
defined through an RFC.  NOTE: usage of Q.SIG within SIP is neither
endorsed nor recommended as a result of this MIME registration.

3. Proposed new media types

ISUP and QSIG messages are composed of arbitrary binary data 
that is transparent to SIP processing. The best way to encode 
these is to use binary encoding. This is in conformance with 
the restrictions imposed on the use of binary data
for MIME (RFC 2045 [3]). It should be noted that the rules 
mentioned in the RFC 2045 apply to Internet mail messages and 
not to SIP  messages. Binary has been preferred over Base64 
encoding because the latter would only result in adding bulk to 
the encoded messages and possibly be more costly in terms of 
processing power.

3.1 ISUP Media Type

This media type is defined by the following information:

Media type name: application
Media subtype name: ISUP
Required parameters: version
Optional parameters: base
Encoding scheme: binary
Security considerations: See section 5.

The ISUP message is encapsulated beginning with the Message Type
Code (i.e., omitting Routing Label and Circuit ID Code).

The use of the 'version' parameter allows network administrators 
to identify specific versions of ISUP that will be exchanged
on a bilateral basis. This enables a particular client 
such as a SoftSwitch/Media Gateway Controller to 
recognize and parse the message correctly,  or (possibly) to 
reject the message if the specified ISUP version is not 
supported. This specification places no constraints on the
values that may be used in 'version'; these are left to the
discretion of the network administrator.

Internet Draft     ISUP and QSIG/MIME types             Oct 2000


'Version' could, for example, be used to identify a network-
specific implementation of ISUP, e.g., X-NetxProprietaryISUPv3,
or to identify a well-known standard version of ISUP, e.g.,
itu-t or ansi.

A 'base' parameter can optionally be included in some cases 
(e.g., if the receiver may not recognize the 'version' string)
to specify that the encapsulated ISUP can also be processed using
the identified 'base' specification.  Table 1 provides a list
of 'base' values supported by the 'application/ISUP' media 
type, including whether or not the forward compatibility 
mechanism defined in ITU-T 1992 ISUP is supported.

              Table 1: ISUP 'base' values

  base             protocol                 compatibility

  itu-t88          ITU-T Q.761-4 (1988)     no
  itu-t92+         ITU-T Q.761-4 (1992)     yes
  ansi88           ANSI T1.113-1988         no
  ansi00           ANSI T1.113-2000         yes
  etsi121          ETS 300 121              no
  etsi356          ES 300 356               yes
  gr317            BELLCORE GR-317          no
  ttc87            JT-Q761-4(1987-1992)     no 
  ttc93+           JT-Q761-4(1993-)         yes 

The Content-Disposition header may be included to describe
how the encapsulated ISUP is to be processed, and in particular
what the handling should be if the received Content-Type is
not recognized.  The default disposition-type for an ISUP
message body is "signal".  This type indicates that the body part 
contains signaling information associated with the session, but 
does not describe the session.

The following is how a typical header would look ('base' 
may be omitted):

	Content-Type: application/ISUP; version=nxv3; 
            base=etsi121
      Content-Disposition: session; handling=optional


3.2 QSIG Media Type

The application/QSIG media type is defined by the following information:

Media type name: application
Media subtype name: QSIG
Required parameters: none
Optional parameters: version
Encoding scheme: binary
Security considerations: See section 5.

Zimmerer, Vemuri  draft-ietf-sip-isup-mime-05.txt      [Page 3]

Internet Draft     ISUP and QSIG/MIME types             Oct 2000

The use of the 'version' parameter allows identification of different 
QSIG variants. This enables the terminating Connection Server to 
recognize and parse the message correctly, or (possibly) to reject the 
message if the particular QSIG variant is not supported. 

Table 2 is a list of protocol versions supported by the 
'application/QSIG' media type.

             Table 2: QSIG versions

        version         protocol
        -------         --------
        iso             ISO/IEC 11572 (Basic Call) and 
                          ISO/IEC 11582 (Generic Functional Protocol)
 
The following is how a typical header would look (Content-Disposition
not included in this instance):

        Content-Type: application/QSIG; version=iso

The default disposition-type is "signal" as in an ISUP body part.

4. Illustrative examples

4.1 ISUP

SIP message format requires a Request line followed by Header 
lines followed by a CRLF separator followed by the message body. To
illustrate the use of the 'application/ISUP' media type, below 
is an INVITE message which has the originating SDP information and
an encapsulated ISUP IAM.  

Note that the two payloads are demarcated by the boundary 
parameter (specified in RFC 2046 [4]) which in the example has 
the value  "unique-boundary-1". This is part of the 
specification of MIME  multipart and is not related to the 
'application/ISUP' media type.

     	INVITE sip:13039263142@Den1.level3.com SIP/2.0
      Via: SIP/2.0/UDP den3.level3.com

Note:
Since binary encoding is used for the ISUP payload, each byte is 
encoded as a byte, and not as a  two-character hex representation.  
Hex digits were used in the draft because a literal encoding of 
those bytes would have been confusing and unreadable.

4.2 QSIG

To illustrate the use of the 'application/QSIG' media type, below is an 
INVITE message which has the originating SDP information and an 
encapsulated QSIG SETUP message.

Note that the two payloads are demarcated by the boundary parameter  
(specified in RFC 2046 [4]) which in the example has the value "unique- 
boundary-1". This is part of the specification of MIME multipart and is  
not related to the 'application/QSIG' media type.

5. Security considerations

Information contained in ISUP and QSIG bodies may include 
sensitive customer information, potentially requiring use of encryption.
Security mechanisms are provided in RFC 2543 (SIP - Session Initiation 
Protocol) and should be used as appropriate for both the SIP message 
and the encapsulated ISUP or QSIG body.

6. IANA considerations

Registrations for the 'version' symbols used within the ISUP and 
QSIG MIME types must specify a definitive specification reference, 
identifying a particular issue of the specification, to which the 
new symbol shall refer. 
 
Note that where a specification is fully peer-to-peer backwards 
compatible with a previous issue (i.e., the compatibility mechanism is 
supported by both), then there is no need for separate symbols to be 
registered. The symbol for the original specification should be used to 
identify backwards-compatible upgrades of that specification as well. 

Symbols beginning with the characters 'X-' are reserved for non-standard 
usage (e.g., cases in which a token other than a string representing an 
issue of an ISUP specification is appropriate for characterizing ISUP 
within an administrative domain). Such non-standard version can only be 
transmitted between administrative domains in accordance with a 
bilateral agreement.
