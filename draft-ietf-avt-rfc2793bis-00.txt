Abstract

   This memo describes how to carry text conversation session contents
   in RTP packets. Text conversation session contents are specified in
   ITU-T Recommendation T.140 [1].

   Text conversation is used alone or in connection to other
   conversational facilities such as video and voice, to form multimedia
   conversation services.

   This RTP payload description contains an optional possibility to
   include redundant text from already transmitted packets in order to
   reduce the risk of text loss caused by packet loss. The redundancy
   coding follows RFC 2198.

1. Introduction

   This document defines two payload types for carrying text
   conversation session contents in RTP packets. Text conversation
   session contents are specified in ITU-T Recommendation T.140 [1].
   Text conversation is used alone or in connection to other
   conversational facilities such as video and voice, to form multimedia
   conversation services. Text in text conversation sessions is sent as
   soon as it is available, or with a small delay for buffering.

                  RTP Payload for Text Conversation     November 2003



   The text is supposed to be entered by human users from a keyboard,
   handwriting recognition, voice recognition or any other input method.
   The rate of character entry is usually at a level of a few characters
   per second or less, though text may be transmitted at a much higher
   rate (e.g., automated systems or "copy and paste" operations may
   produce a lot of text very rapidly). Therefore, it is generally
   expected number of characters to transmit is low. Only one or a few
   new characters are expected to be transmitted with each packet.

   T.140 specifies that text and other T.140 elements MUST be
   transmitted in ISO 10 646-1 code with UTF-8 transformation. That
   makes it easy to implement internationally useful applications, and
   to handle the text in modern information technology environments.
   The payload of an RTP packet following this specification consists of
   text encoded according to T.140 without any additional framing.  A
   common case will be a single ISO 10646 character, UTF-8 encoded.

   T.140 requires the transport channel to provide characters without
   duplication and in original order.  Text conversation users expect
   that text will be delivered with no or a low level of lost
   information. If lost information can be indicated, the willingness to
   accept loss is expected to be higher.

   Therefore a mechanism based on RTP is specified here. It gives text
   arrival in correct order, without duplications, and with detection
   and indication of losses.  It also includes an optional possibility
   to repeat data for redundancy to lower the risk of loss. Since packet
   overhead is usually much larger than the T.140 contents, the increase
   in channel load by the redundancy scheme is minimal.

   This document updates and extends RFC 2793.  The text clarifies
   ambiguities in RFC 2793, improves on the specific implementation
   requirements learned through development experience, gives explicit
   usage examples, and introduces a means of transporting text
   interleaved with voice within the same RTP session.

3. Usage of RTP

   payloads as described in this specification SHOULD be used.

                  RTP Payload for Text Conversation     November 2003


3.1 Payload Format for Transmission of text/t140 Data

   A text conversation RTP packet as specified by this payload format
   consists of an RTP header as defined in RFC 3550 [2] followed
   immediately by a block of T.140 data, referred to as a "T140block"
   (see section 3.3).  There is no additional header specific to this
   payload format.

   This format is primarily used when text is transmitted on a separate
   RTP session dedicated for the transmission of text and not shared
   with other media, such as audio, DTMF, etc.  IP textphone devices
   most commonly use this format.

3.2 Payload Format for Transmission of audio/t140 Data

   A text conversation RTP packet as specified by this payload format
   consists of an RTP header as defined in RFC 3550 followed immediately
   by a 16-bit "t140block counter" followed by a "T140block" (see
   section 3.3).  There is no additional header specific to this payload
   format.

   The T140block counter MUST be initialized to zero the first time that
   a packet containing a T140block is transmitted and MUST be
   incremented by 1 each time that a new block is transmitted.  Once the
   counter reaches the value 0xFFFF, the counter is reset to 0 the next
   time the counter is incremented.  This T140block counter may be
   utilized to detect lost characters.

   For the purposes of readability, the remainder of this document only
   refers to the T140block without making explicit reference to the
   T140block counter.  Readers should understand that when using the
   audio/t140 format, the T140block counter MUST always precede the
   actual T140block, including redundant data transmissions.

   The primary purpose for this payload specification is to allow
   gateways that are interconnecting two PSTN networks to interleave,
   through a single RTP session, audio and text data received on the
   PSTN circuit.  This is comparable to the way in which DTMF is
   extracted and transmitted within an RTP session [9].

3.3 The "T140block"

   The T140block contains one or more T.140 code elements as specified
   in [1].  Most T.140 code elements are single ISO 10646 [5]
   characters, but some are multiple character sequences.  Each
   character is UTF-8 encoded [6] into one or more octets. This implies
   that each block MUST contain an integral number of UTF-8 encoded
   characters regardless of the number of octets per character. It also

                  RTP Payload for Text Conversation     November 2003


   implies that any composite character sequence (CCS) SHOULD be placed
   within one block.

3.4 Use of Redundancy

   The T140blocks MAY be transmitted redundantly according to the
   payload format defined in RFC 2198 [3].  In that case, the RTP header
   is followed by one or more redundant data block headers, the same
   number of redundant data fields carrying T140blocks from previous
   packets, and finally the new (primary) T140block for this packet.

3.5 Use of Forward Error Correction

   When transmitting text via RTP that is interleaved with audio, it is
   possible to use other robustness mechanisms, including Forward Error
   Correction (FEC) as described in RFC 2733 [8].  As text appears to be
   logically no different than audio in such applications, the same
   mechanisms may be employed with audio/t140 as with other audio
   formats.

3.6 Synchronization of Text with Other Media

   Usually, each medium in a session utilizes a separate RTP stream. In
   that case, if synchronization of the text and other media packets is
   important, the streams MUST be associated when the sessions are
   established and the streams MUST share the reference clock (refer to
   the description of the timestamp field as it relates to
   synchronization in section 5.1 of RFC 3550).  Association of RTP
   streams is dependent on the particular session application and is
   outside the scope of this document.

   When audio/t140 is used, it is generally transmitted as interleaved
   packets between voice packets or other kinds of audio packets.  One
   should observe the RTP timestamps of the voice, text, or other audio
   packets in order to reproduce the stream correctly when playing out
   the audio.  Note, also, that incoming text from a PSTN circuit might
   be at a higher bit-rate than can be played out on an egress PSTN
   circuit.  As such, it is possible that, on the egress side, a gateway
   may not complete the play out of the text packets before it is time
   to play the next voice packet.  Given that this application is
   primarily for the benefit of deaf users utilizing PSTN textphone
   devices, it is strongly RECOMMENDED that all text packets be properly
   reproduced on the egress gateway before considering any subsequent
   voice or other audio packets.  If necessary, voice and other audio
   packets should be discarded in order to properly reproduce the text
   signals on the PSTN circuit.

3.7 RTP packet header

                  RTP Payload for Text Conversation     November 2003


   Each RTP packet starts with a fixed RTP header. The following fields
   of the RTP fixed header are used for T.140 text streams:

   Payload Type (PT): The assignment of an RTP payload type is specific
     to the RTP profile under which this payload format is used.  For
     profiles that use dynamic payload type number assignment, this
     payload format is identified by the name "T140" (see section 8).
     If redundancy is used per RFC 2198, the Payload Type MUST indicate
     that payload format ("RED").

   Sequence number: The Sequence Number MUST be increased by one for
     each new transmitted packet. When transmitting text using the
     payload format for text/t140, it is used for detection of packet
     loss and packets out of order, and can be used in the process of
     retrieval of redundant text, reordering of text and marking missing
     text.  (Character loss is detected through the T140block counter
     when using the audio/t140 payload format.)

   Timestamp: The RTP Timestamp encodes the approximate instance of
     entry of the primary text in the packet. A clock frequency of 1000
     Hz MUST be used for text/t140.  The clock frequency may be
     specified for audio/t140 and is generally set to be 8000 Hz, as
     that is most common for audio.  Sequential packets MUST NOT use the
     same timestamp. Since packets do not represent any constant
     duration, the timestamp cannot be used to directly infer packet
     losses.

3.8 Additional Headers

   There are no additional headers defined specific to this payload
   format.

   When redundant transmission of the data according to RFC 2198 is
   desired, the RTP header is followed by one or more redundant data
   block headers, one for each redundant data block to be included.
   Each of these headers provides the timestamp offset and length of the
   corresponding data block plus a payload type number indicating this
   payload format ("T140").  Redundant data older than 16383 divided by
   the clock frequency MUST not be transmitted.

3.9 T.140 Text Structure

   T.140 text is UTF-8 coded as specified in T.140 with no extra
   framing. When using the format with redundant data, the transmitter
   MAY select a number of T140block generations to retransmit in each
   packet. A higher number introduces better protection against loss of
   text but increases the data rate.

                  RTP Payload for Text Conversation     November 2003


   Since packets are not generated at regular intervals and since the
   audio/t140 format allows for other media to be interleaved, the
   timestamp is not sufficient to identify a packet in the presence of
   loss unless extra information is provided. Since sequence numbers are
   not provided in the redundant header, some additional rules must be
   followed to allow the redundant data corresponding to missing primary
   data to be merged properly into the stream of primary data T140blocks
   when using the text/t140 payload format.  While the audio/t140
   payload format does not rely on the sequence numbers of packets to
   identify missing data, the same rules apply.  They are:

     - Each redundant data block MUST contain the same data as a
       T140block previously transmitted as primary data, and be
       identified with a timestamp offset equating to the original
       timestamp for that T140block.
     - The redundant data MUST be placed in age order with most recent
       redundant T140block last in the redundancy area.
     - All T140blocks from the oldest desired generation up through the
       generation immediately preceding the new (primary) T140block
       MUST be included.

   For the text/t140 payload format, these rules allow the sequence
   numbers for the redundant T140blocks to be inferred by counting
   backwards from the sequence number in the RTP header.  The result
   will be that all the text in the payload will be contiguous and in
   order.

4. Recommended Procedure

   This section contains RECOMMENDED procedures for usage of the payload
   format.  Based on the information in the received packets, the
   receiver can:

     - reorder text received out of order.
     - mark where text is missing because of packet loss.
     - compensate for lost packets by using redundant data.

4.1 Recommended Basic Procedure

   Packets are transmitted only when there is valid T.140 data to
   transmit. The sequence number is used for sequencing of T.140 data.

   T.140 specifies that T.140 data MAY be buffered before transmission
   for a short moment. A maximum buffering time of 500 ms is specified.
   In order to keep the maximum bit rate usage for text at a reasonable
   level, it is RECOMMENDED to buffer T.140 data for transmission in 300
   ms intervals. This time is selected so that text users will still
   perceive a real time text flow.

                  RTP Payload for Text Conversation     November 2003


   On reception of text/t140 data, the RTP sequence number is compared
   with the sequence number of the last correctly received packet.  On
   receipt of audio/t140 data, the T140block counter is compared with
   the T140block counter of the last correctly received packet.  If they
   are consecutive, the (only or primary) T140block is retrieved from
   the packet.

4.2 Recommended Procedure for Compensation for Lost Packets

   For reduction of data loss in case of packet loss, redundant data MAY
   be included in the packets following to the procedures in RFC 2198.
   If network conditions are not known, it is RECOMMENDED to use three
   redundant T140blocks in each packet. If there is a gap in the RTP
   sequence numbers (for text/t140) or T140block counters (audio/t140),
   and redundant T140blocks are available in a subsequent packet, the
   sequence numbers or T140block counters for the redundant T140blocks
   should be inferred by counting backwards from the sequence number or
   T140block counter in the RTP header for that packet.  If there are
   redundant T140blocks with sequence numbers matching those that are
   missing, the redundant T140blocks may be substituted for the missing
   T140blocks.

   As an alternative (or in addition) to redundancy, Forward Error
   Correction mechanisms may be used when transmitting audio/t140 text,
   as per RFC 2733.

   Both for the case when redundancy or FEC is used and not used,
   missing data SHOULD be marked by insertion of a missing text marker
   in the received stream for each missing T140block, as specified in
   ITU-T T.140 Addendum 1 [1].

4.3 Recommended Procedure for Compensation for Packets Out of Order

   For protection against packets arriving out of order, the following
   procedure MAY be implemented in the receiver.  If analysis of a
   received packet reveals a gap in the sequence and no redundant data
   is available to fill that gap, the received packet SHOULD be kept in
   a buffer to allow time for the missing packet(s) to arrive.  It is
   RECOMMENDED that the waiting time be limited to 0.5 seconds.

   If a packet with a T140block belonging to the gap arrives before the
   waiting time expires, this T140block is inserted into the gap and
   then consecutive T140blocks from the leading edge of the gap may be
   consumed.  Any T140block which does not arrive before the time limit
   expires should be treated as lost.

4.4 Transmission During "Silent Periods" when Redundancy is Used




Hellstrom                 Expires - May 2004                  [Page 8]

                  RTP Payload for Text Conversation     November 2003


   When using the redundancy transmission scheme, and there is redundant
   data, but no new T.140 data to transmit after the transmit buffering
   interval described in section 4.1 has passed, a packet MUST be
   transmitted containing a zero-length primary T140block and the
   properly positioned redundant data.  When using the audio/t140
   payload format with an empty T140block, the T140block counter MUST
   also be absent (as there is no actual T140block).

   When using the text/t140 payload format, any zero-length T140blocks
   that are sent as primary data MUST be included as redundant
   T140blocks on subsequent packets just as normal text T140blocks would
   be so that sequence number inference for the redundant T140blocks
   will be correct, as explained in section 3.9.

   When using the audio/t140 payload format, zero-length T140blocks sent
   as primary data MUST NOT be included as redundant T140blocks, as it
   would simply be a waste of bandwidth to send them.

   Redundancy for the last T140block MUST NOT be implemented by
   repeatedly transmitting the same packet (with the same sequence
   number) because this will cause the packet loss count, as reported in
   RTCP, to decrement.

5. SDP Attribute for Character Transmission Rate

   In some cases, it is necessary to limit the rate at which characters
   are transmitted.  While the "b=" SDP attribute could be used to limit
   the rate of the RTP session, it may be that only the text stream in
   an interleaved audio/text session needs special handling.  For
   example, when a PSTN gateway is interworking between an IP device
   (not necessarily a textphone) and a PSTN textphone, it may be
   necessary to limit the character rate from the IP device in order to
   avoid throwing away characters at the PSTN gateway.  At the same
   time, no explicit bit rate restriction is necessarily applied to the
   audio stream.

   To control the character transmission rate, the "fmtp" attribute [7]
   is used with the following syntax:

       a=fmtp:<format> cps=<integer>

   The <format> field is populated with the payload type that is used
   for text.  The <integer> field contains an integer representing the
   maximum number of characters that may be received per second.

   Devices in receipt of this parameter MUST adhere to the request to
   apply by transmitting characters at a rate at or below the specified
   <integer> value.

      redundancy and one primary data block.  The value of the "R2

      This is an example of an RTP packet with one redundant T140block
      using audio/t140 payload format.  The primary data block is
      empty, which is the case when transmitting a packet for the
      sole purpose of forcing the redundant data to be transmitted
      in the absence of any new data.  Note that since this is the
      audio/t140 payload format, the redundant block of T.140 data
      is immediately preceded with a T140block Counter.

      As a follow-on to the previous example, this example shows the
      next RTP packet in the sequence which does contain a new real
      T140block when using the audio/t140 payload format.  This
      example has 2 levels of redundancy and one primary data block.
      Since the previous primary block was empty, no redundant data
      is included for that block.  This is because when using the
      audio/t140 payload format, any previously transmitted "empty"
      T140blocks are NOT included as redundant data in subsequent
      packets.

6.3 SDP Examples

   Below is an example of SDP describing RTP text transport on port
   11000:

                  RTP Payload for Text Conversation     November 2003


       m=text 11000 RTP/AVP 98
       a=rtpmap:98 t140/1000

   Below is an example of SDP similar to the above example, but also
   utilizing RFC 2198 to provide redundancy for the text packets:

       m=text 11000 RTP/AVP 98 100
       a=rtpmap:98 t140/1000
       a=rtpmap:100 red/1000
       a=fmtp:100 98/98

   Below is an example of SDP describing RTP text interleaved with G.711
   audio packets within the same RTP session from port 7200 and at a
   maximum text rate of 6 characters per second:

       m=audio 7200 RTP/AVP 0 98
       a=rtpmap:98 t140/8000
       a=fmtp:98 cps=6

   Below is an example using RFC 2198 to provide redundancy to just the
   text packets in an RTP session with interleaving text and G.711 at a
   text rate no faster than 6 characters per second:

       m=audio 7200 RTP/AVP 0 98 100
       a=rtpmap:98 t140/8000
       a=fmtp:98 cps=6
       a=rtpmap:100 red/8000
       a=fmtp:100 98/98

   Note - While these examples utilize the RTP/AVP profile, it is not
   intended to limit the scope of this memo to use with only that
   profile.  Rather, any appropriate profile may be used in conjunction
   with this memo.

7. Security Considerations

   Since the intention of the described payload format is to carry text
   in a text conversation, security measures in the form of encryption
   are of importance. The amount of data in a text conversation session
   is low and therefore any encryption method MAY be selected and
   applied to T.140 session contents or to the whole RTP packets. When
   redundant data is included, the same security considerations as for
   RFC 2198 apply.  Additionally, all of the security considerations
   from section 14 or RFC 3550 apply.

8. MIME Media Type Registrations

   This document defines an RTP payload named "t140" and two associated
   MIME types, "text/t140" and "audio/t140".
