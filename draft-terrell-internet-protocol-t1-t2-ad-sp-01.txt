Abstract

    
    
    This paper provides a visualization of the lack of IP Address Control,
    a Blunder, which may be excused partly because of the impossibility of
    Predicting the Current, as well as the Future use and growth of the
    Internet. Furthermore, this investigation also attempts a Critical
    Analysis for Current use of the HD-Ratio in the IPv4 and IPv6 IP
    Specifications. Moreover, while the IPv4 and IPv6 specifications are
    indeed the primary focus. To provide a fair comparison however, this
    Analysis requires, if not mandates, the use of the IPt1 and IPt2
    specifications as well. The reasoning here nevertheless, is the
    difference in the respective Addressing Schematics. Where by, the
    primary focuses of the former renders a greater significance to the
    HOST IP Address (Assignment), while the focus of the latter emphasizes
    only the Network IP Address. However, it shall be concluded, this
    distinction affects the Efficiency, which is the RATIO of Total Number
    of Nodes that can be attached to Service the Global Networking Community,
    and the Number of available IP Addresses used for the Connection.

    In other words, this 'Analysis is Argument' focusing upon the HD-Ratio,
    which results in the introduction of the foundation Defining the
    'INTERNET PROTOCOL t1 and t2 ADDRESS SPACE', that exceeds the
    Requirements specified in RFC1550 Defining a New IP Addressing System.

Introduction: Analysis and Impact of the IPv4 Internet Protocol
              Address Space, which Questions the Current Use of
              and Application of the 'CIDR Notation'



    
    The mathematical learning curve regarding an understanding of such
    concepts as 'Bit Mapping' the 'Network Portion of an IP Address' can
    be long and arduous. And this is seen especially true, when trying to
    grasp the 'How-To's' and functional purpose of 'CIDR'. And while, I
    have read the works from only a few authors whose approach makes a
    distinction, as would be a noted difference in the interpretation of
    the definition of 'CIDR'. I have noted moreover, their approach is not
    a pronounced separation, as would be an unquestionable distinction used
    in the 'Water and Oil' analogy from Chemistry. However, the beginner,
    would understand quite clearly the difference between the 'Front-End'
    and 'Back-End' approaches used in "Supernetting of an IP Address".
    Where by the 'Bit Mapping' of the 'Network Portion', would represent
    the 'Front-End' approach, and the 'Bit Mapping' of the 'Host Portion'
    would represent the 'Back-End' approach, in what is defined, or called
    the "Supernetting of an IP Address", or 'CIDR'. Nevertheless, while the
    mathematical operation involved in either the 'Front-End' or 'Back-End'
    usage of ÊCIDR∆ is not, by itself, confusing or conflicting operations.
    Still, a lot remains the Wishful Dream, or on the 'Wish List' of the
    hopeful, regarding a greater Specificity in the definition and
    distinction of the functional 'Parameters' associated with the conventions
    used in the 'CIDR' notation representing a Network IP Address. Needless
    to say, this becomes even more evident when trying to understand the
    "INTERNET PROTOCOL V4 ADDRESS SPACE", which was developed and used by
    IANA as a guide, or scheme, Denoting some Method used to determine IP
    Address Availability, Special Assignment, and Allocation.

    In other words, TABLE 1, the "IPv4 Internet Protocol Address Space",
    according to the current standards and definition of 'CIDR', one would
    conclude that there is a great number of IP Addresses wasted on HOST
    Assignments. And this is apparent from the 'Bit Map' definition assigned
    to the notation "/8". Where in any 32 Bit IP Addressing format, this
    'Bit Mapping' notation accounts for (Class A = 126 x 254^3) 2,064,770,064
    IP Addresses under the current IPv4 specification, that is, without using
    the 'Front-End' indicator from Class A. And then, when it is used, it
    would it would account, (again using the current definitions of 'CIDR')
    an assignment, or allocation of more than 16 Million IP Address
    (1 X 245^3). Which, to say the very least, amounts to IP Address waste,
    because this has the effect of providing a Host with Network Status. 'Not
    to mention that most of the companies, who has such an arrangement are
    not "IPS's".

IPt1 and IPt2 ADDRESS SPACE                            October 15, 2002





    Nevertheless, the Mathematical Problem(s) encompassing these definitions
    far out weight the problems associated with IP Address Waste. In other
    words, the Current Methods and Definitions of 'CIDR', regarding it use
    in 'Bit Mapping' an IP Address, is Mathematically Incorrect. Or just
    plain Wrong! In other words, an '8 Bit Mapping' Designation under the
    Current '32 Bit IP Specification', can only account for '255' IP
    Addresses (And NO more than that!). To be more specific however, what
    this means Mathematically, is that, there is only '1' of the '4' '8 Bit
    Quadrants' being used, which sets the Parameters for the Total Number of
    IP Addresses Assigned. Moreover, the use of only '1' Quadrant, as a means
    for specification, regarding the total number of IP Addresses assigned, is
    an Error, which can not be used to Account for the 'Diversity in Number',
    regarding the Total Number Combinations Derived from the Calculation of
    the Total Number of IP Addresses Contained in the IP Address Class.

    Unfortunately however, the above argument leads to a mathematical Proof,
    which revives an Old Argument regarding the Method of Enumeration using
    the Binary Numbering System. In other words, the Total, or Inclusive
    Count, which would represent the '8 Bit Mapping' notation, '/8', would
    not yield the Binary Number '255'. It would in fact represent '256',
    because Zero, under the Current Binary Specification, is indeed a Binary
    Number (0000). Furthermore, it should be understood, that this does serve
    not only the explanation for the ongoing argument, but the Current
    Definition of the Modern Binary System as well. Which is to say, under
    the Current, or Modern Binary System, {11111111} = '8 Bits' = '255', does
    not follow from the Definition of '2', representing Base, in what is
    clearly (And has been Defined as Being) an Exponential, represented by
    the equation, 2^N (Where N = some Positive Integer). In which case, the
    the Total, or Inclusive Count for an '8 Bit' translation of a Binary
    Number representing an Integer, would be given by the equation,
    '2^8 = 256'. This moreover, Mathematically implies the equation,
    8^32 = 256^4, which would be interpreted as meaning; 'There are '32'
    Bits used to represent the '4,294,967,296' Integers, which represents
    the Total Number of IP Addresses contained in the IPv4 Addressing
    Specification. Nevertheless, while the counting methods used in the
    Binary System remain in Dispute, an adequate representation for the 'CIDR'
    Notation can be determined using the Current Binary Methods for
    Enumeration. That is, given by TABLE 2, we have:

    Nevertheless, while Table 2 provides a better description and use of the
    'CIDR' notation, it falls extricably short from the full exploitation, and
    the actual representation regarding the True Value of 'CIDR'. In other
    words, the real Value for the use of 'CIDR', would be seen to take
    advantage of the Total Number of IP Addresses contained in the IPv4
    specification, and not just the limited number of IP Addresses contained
    in 'Class C'. Where by, it should be very clear, that while Table 1 does
    provide an easily discernable explanation of the IP Addresses Allocated.
    Now. It also shows the IP Address waste, because it does nothing to change,
    nor fix the Loss of more than 16 Million IP Addresses, for every IP Address
    issued, which represents the Number IP Addresses wasted on HOST Address
    assignment. Nonetheless, Re-Defining the CIDR' Notation as depicting the
    'Network Prefix' and the 'Bit Range it Uses', as used in Table 2, under
    column '1', does indeed provide the necessary foundation for its full
    exploitation, and establishes a smooth Transition, which is represented
    in the 'IPt1 IP Addressing Specification' (See Chapter II). Needless to
    say, this method clearly follows from the definition of 'CIDR', and builds
    upon the foundation, logically, that is has already established.

Chapter I: Analysis IPv4, IPv6, IPt1, and IPt2 address space using
           the HD-Ratio



    As shown in RFC1715, and RFC3194, the HD-ratio proved to be a Dismal
    Failure for use as an indicator to determine IP Address use and
    Distribution Efficiencies. In fact, it can easily be concluded that the
    IPt1 and IPt2 IP Specification are the only Addressing Protocols which
    meet the All of the Requirements outlined in RFC1550, especially since,
    they were Logically Derived from the IPv4 IP Specification. In other
    words, the IPt1 and IPt2 Protocol Specifications not only meet the
    Transitional requirements, as would be viewed as meeting all of the
    Engineering considerations required under RFC1550, but it also offers
    a more Gradual, and yet Infinite Expansion Possibilities, to meet the
    challenge that only the Colonization of the Universe could provide.

    Needless to say, when examining the benefits of using the HD-Ratio, one
    would discover, that is has absolutely No application regarding the
    determination of the Efficiency Rating for the IPt1 and IPt2 Addressing
    Protocol Specification, because these protocols makes use of more than
    99.999+% of the IP Addresses contained in this Addressing System. And
    while, some of the additional protocol definitions and specifications,
    which increased the benefits of the IPv4 foundation, has been remarked,
    or viewed as being unnecessary Growing Pains. These remarks should not be
    considered as being anything but unintelligent babblings. As an example,
    the use of 'CIDR', while not fully exploited, followed logically the
    foundation of the IPv4 Specification, and paved the way for the
    Mathematical and Logical derivation of a 2 New IP Addressing Systems,
    which Completely exploited the Solid Foundation provided by the IPv4
    Specification. In other words, at best, the HD-Ratio, like the H-Ratio,
    is a Beguilement, whose only purpose is to deceive, because surely the
    Logarithmic Equation described in RFC1715 could not serve any vital
    purpose. In which case, the author would have been better off using the
    elementary method for calculating the actual Efficiency Rating (see
    Eq. 1). Because taking the Log to the Base 10, using this equation, would
    not have derived any practical meaning, at least not one which could be
    translated into some actuate determination for some Efficiency Rating
    regarding the IP Addressing Systems. And this becomes even more apparent,
    when it is realized that the Number of Bits used to represent an IP
    Address does not account for the Total Number of IP Addresses available
    in the IP Addressing System.

                                     Eq. 1

                             log (number of objects)
                         H = -----------------------
                                  available bits
 
         

    Furthermore, while RFC3194 provides a more actuate Logarithmic Equation,
    for Efficiency Determination, its usage would be more applicable in a
    Current Use scenario (See Eq. 2). This becomes even more apparent when it
    is realized that the 'Numerator' used in the equation is a 'Constant', and
    not the result derived from some 'Sampling Related to a Statistical
    Analyses of the World's Population Growth, or Decline Patterns. 
      

                                     Eq. 2


                         log(number of allocated objects)
                HD = ------------------------------------------
                     log(maximum number of allocatable objects)


    Even still, suppose for a moment that Eq. 2 were a valid representation
    for the determination of the Efficient Rating for an IP Addressing System.
    And suppose even further, that a test was needed to determine the value of
    the IPt1 Addressing Specification, then the results from the Calculations
    using this equation would be 'Startling', because the 'HD-Ratio' would
    approach NEARLY a VALUE of '1'. This is because all of the available IP
    Addresses, which are available in this IP Addressing Specification are
    used for Network Assignment, the point of 'Demarcation', that excludes
    the use of a viable Network IP Address for Host Address Assignment. And
    if you would note Table 3, and the Currently Acceptable IP Network
    Addressing Practices, then it would be realized, that the Entire World
    could Actually be Networked using only Section 'A-1' from Class A of IPt1
    IP Addressing Specification.

    Furthermore, since the Prefixes used in the IPt2 IP Protocol Specification
    can not be used in any calculation, which would be required for the
    Determination of the Efficiency Rating regarding the use of the Total
    Number of IP Address. Then their use within the IPt2 Protocol
    Specification is indeed an Enhancement, which can only be viewed as a
    Magnification Freebie. That is, without question, IPt2 allows a more
    Gradual Growth that can quite easily be Expanded to Infinity (See Tables
    4 and 5). In which case, Population Growth really does not matter, because
    it is now a Variable that has been removed from the Equation.

    Nevertheless, while there was some mention of a comparison to other
    Addressing Systems, there was No mention regarding the way these Numbering
    Systems were used or even Allocated (i.e. The telephony System). In other
    words, their mention was pointless, because no clear foundation, that
    could be viewed as having establish the Point upon which an Argument
    could be based was ever mentioned or shown to exist. In a word; 'I
    actually did not understand the point, nor purpose of either RFC1715 nor
    RFC3194, because it seems that these RFCs were focused more upon the
    Logarithmic Equation, rather than the reported objective regarding the
    Efficiency Rating, and the Determination of the most efficient IP
    Addressing scheme that should be used. Furthermore, while I have read
    some mention regarding the 'Address Space Allocation Table(s), it was
    never pointed out, that the 'Address Allocation Table' (Or "INTERNET
    PROTOCOL ADDRESS SPACE") could quite literally invalidate any calculation
    regarding efficiency, because such a TABLE can also be INEFFICIENT.

Chapter II: Suggestion for the IPt1 and IPt2 Internet Protocol Address
            Space, Supernetting and the New 'CIDR' Notation


    The "Internet Protocol v4 Address Space" allocation Table, as noted in
    'Table 1' above, can retain the same IP Address Allocation, in the 'IPt1
    IP Protocol Specification'. In fact, the only guide lines that would be
    different, and appropriated, are those governing the 'Host' Address
    Allocation, whose derivation is Defined by 'The Laws of the Octet'.
    Furthermore, noting Table 2, it should be understood that it represents
    an 'IP Address Allocation / Translation Guide', which would be used to
    determine the total Number of Available IP Addresses when converting from
    the IPv4 to the IPt1 Addressing Specifications. This Table represents
    the IP Address conversion, which should be viewed as extremely important,
    because the IPt1 Specification makes use of nearly all of the total number
    of IP Addresses for use as the Network IP Address. And while there are
    Host Addresses Assigned, there are No Viable network IP Addresses wasted
    or used for this purpose (See The Laws of the Octet.).

    Nevertheless, the description shown in Table 6 provides an Example, which
    describes the 'Supernetting of an IP Address' when using the 'IPt1'
    specification, which also uses the New Notation for 'CIDR'. However, this
    is a Practice, 'Supernetting of an IP Address', that can only be used
    BEHIND the 'Point of Demarcation' (The 'VIABLE Network IP Address'), for
    the purpose of Subnet creation, because to do so otherwise would not only
    be in violation of 'The Laws of the Octet', but it would create an
    Addressing Conflict within the IP Addressing Scheme itself. Even still,
    is should nevertheless be very clear, that the 'CIDR' Notation represents
    the 'Bit Mapped Displacement' of the Network IP Address, and nothing more.  
    
    Moreover, since the IPt1 specification uses the same IP Addressing methods
    for enumeration, as that used in IPv4. It can quite easily be employed, and
    replace, in every scenario now occupied and used by the IPv4 Specification.
    There is an exception however, which translates into recovery of wasted IP
    Addresses that can be recovered from the "Internet Protocol v4 Address
    Space". In other words, as previously mentioned, the primary difference
    between these IP Specifications, beyond the Schematic itself, is the way
    they each use and assign 'Host IP Addresses'. Where by, the assignment
    of '1' IP Address, is just that, because there are No 16 Million Host IP
    Addresses that will accompany this assignment under the IPt1 specification.
    And while this may be viewed as a problem with the IPt1 specification, it
    certainly does not become a consideration for the implementation of the
    IPt2 Addressing Specification. In fact, the IPt2 Addressing Specification
    not only provides foundation for the possibility for Unlimited IP
    Addresses, it simplifies the "Internet Protocol Address Space" Table,
    (See Table 7) while reducing the Management Burden associated with the
    Allocation of IP Addresses.

    Nevertheless, any careful examination and study of Table 7, the "INTERNET
    PROTOCOL t2 ADDRESS SPACE", and its INDEX. Anyone would readily conclude;
    'It does not matter if the World's Population Doubled or Tripled in 5, 10,
    or 15 years from now, because the number of IP Addresses contained in the
    Surplus of IP Area Code Addresses, for each Continent, would presently
    sustain a 20 Billion total World Population, and this says nothing about
    the Reserve IP Addresses allocation to IANA. In fact, if there is an
    agreement (which it will be) regarding the New Binary System, it will not
    pose any difficulties for IANA, because these IP Specifications were
    derived and first discovered, using the New Method of Enumeration, as
    defined by the New Binary System. In other words, the IPt1 and IPt2 IP
    Protocol Specifications overwhelmingly surpasses every Requirement
    Specified in RFC1550.

Chapter III: IPt1 and IPt2; The APRA and IN-ADD.APRA Addresses


    It has been mention that the IPt1 IP Specification differs only in 2
    primary areas from that of the IPv4 IP Addressing system. And these
    differences account for the use of more than 99.999...+ % of the total
    number of available IP Addresses contained in this System of Addressing,
    and the way Host IP Addresses are allocated. Needless to say, other than
    the Schematic itself, that's it. In other words, the use of 'APRA and
    IN-ADD.APRA functions the same in the IPt1 IP Specification, and except
    for the 'SIGHT' of the Prefixes used in the IPt2 Specification, their use
    functions the same under this IP Specification as well. In other words,
    the Prefixes used in the IPt2 IP Specification, serve only the provisions
    regarding stability, control, management, and increase the Number of IP
    Addresses (And nothing more!). Because other than these benefits, the
    Prefixes used in the IPt2 IP Specification does absolutely nothing to
    effect, nor change any other the practices or procedures used in the
    IPv4 Protocol. Furthermore, while I do not advocate the used of the
    Primary IP Protocol in Networking Household Appliances, (behind the
    demarcation). It should be clearly understood, not only is the IPt2 IP
    Specification well suited for this application, but there is absolutely No
    Protocol Requirement, or Demand, it is not suited to address...And it goes
    without saying, it does indeed, maintain a sufficient supply of IP
    Addresses, regardless (The 'IPtX' IP Specification: See Table 8).       



                                   Table 8
 
                            'IPtX IP Specification'


                              IPt1     =    32 Bit

                              IPt2     =    64 Bit

                              IPt3     =    96 Bit

                              IPt4     =    128 Bit

                              IPt5     =    160 Bit

                               :       :      :       
                               :       :      : 

                              IPtX     =    Infinity

Chapter IV: Security


    This document, whose only objective was the explanation for the
    method(s) used in the Efficiency Determination of an IP Addressing
    Specification, and the development of a possible (Suggestion) "INTERNET
    PROTOCOL ADDRESS SPACE" for the 'IPt1 and IPt2 IP Addressing
    Specifications', which actually did not directly raise any security
    issues. Hence, there are no issues raised that warrant Security
    Considerations.
