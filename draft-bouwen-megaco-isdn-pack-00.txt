1. Abstract

   This draft introduces a Megaco package to support voip access
   gateways with ISDN terminations. The package defines
   TerminationState properties for ISDN terminations, and
   events/signals that are to be used for the layer 1
   activation/deactivation procedure for ISDN basic interfaces.

2. ISDN Package Description

   Package Name: isdnpack
   Package ID: ISDN (0x00xx)
        Version: 1
        Extends: none
        Description:
          This package defines properties for ISDN basic and primary
          rate terminations, and events/signals for layer 1
          activation/deactivation

   PROPERTIES

   Channel Type
        PropertyID: chantype (0x0001)
        Description:
          Identifies the type of ISDN channel for a ISDN termination
        Type: Enumeration

          Contains the binary interface identifier used in Q.931
          Messages when a D-channel in a PRI has been provisioned to
          act as signalling channel for several PRIs.
        Type: Double
        Possible Values: operator-dependent
        Defined in: TerminationState
        Characteristics: Read

   Associated D-channel
        PropertyID: assocd (0x0003)
        Description:

        Possible Values:
        Defined in: TerminationState

   Activation Policy
        PropertyID: permact (0x0004)
        Description:
          Specifies if the Basic Interface is permanently activated, or
          if the activation/deactivation procedure should be followed.

        Description:
        SignalType: OO
        Duration: not applicable
        Additional Parameters: None


   STATISTICS

   None


   PROCEDURES

   The defined events and signals for layer 1 activation/deactivation
   are modelled on the existing decomposition practice in the Switched
   Circuit Network. The events and signals are a simplified subset of
   the control protocol messages defined in V5.1 {1,2]. The messages
   can be used to support the activation/deactivation procedure for
   ISDN basic interfaces as defined in ITU-T recommendation I.430.[3]
   Layer 2 activation is managed with IUA messages [4].
