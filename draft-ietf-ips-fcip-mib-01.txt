2. Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based internets.
   In particular it defines objects for managing a FCIP device, as
   defined in [FCIP]. This MIB is defined such that it can be viewed as
   an extension to the existing FC Management Framework Integration MIB,
   as specified in [FCMGMT].

3. The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        STD 16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC
        1215 [RFC1215].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described
        in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and
        STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

    o   Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second version of
        the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards
        track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
        [RFC1901] and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version of the
        message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906
        [RFC1906], RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].

    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second set of
        protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in
        RFC 1905 [RFC1905].

    o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573
        [RFC2573] and the view-based access control mechanism described
        in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine

   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

4. Overview of FCIP Device Based Interconnection Model 

   Note that the FCIP Device is fully described in [FCIP] from a functional 
   point of view; whereas this section describes the FCIP Device from 
   management point of view.

   The FCIP device is modeled as a "gateway" FC Connectivity Unit, since the 
   FCIP device acts as a gateway connection unit to bridge the FC onto the 
   IP technology. 
 
   The FCIP devices provides IP-based interconnection model to interconnect 
   the FC fabric elements. In this model, the FCIP-devices, along with 
   their IP-network, provides a new FCIP transport network. The FC fabric 
   elements (FC-FEs) will support the Logical FC Links in their overlay 
   network that resides on this FCIP transport network.

   This IP-based FCIP Interconnection Model supports the following 
   topology:
   o The FCIP-based transport network is formed by interconnecting the
     FCIP-devices.
   o Each FCIP device has one or more FCIP Entities.
   o Peer FCIP Entities are connected by FCIP Links.
   o Each FCIP Link contains one or more Data Engine.
   o The FCIP-device can work as a stand-alone box or as part 
     of a FC fabric element. 

5. Relationship to other MIBs

   Objects accessible from other MIBs applicable to FCIP devices have not
   been included in this MIB.

5.1 Relationship to the 'TCP' group of MIB-II

   This group is mandatory for all systems which implement TCP. Objects
   relevant to TCP must be obtained from this group.

5.2 Relationship to the 'interfaces' MIB
   
   The 'interfaces' group is defined as being mandatory for
   all systems and contains information on an entity's interfaces.
   Each FCIP Link will run over a physical link described by objects
   in this group.

5.3 Relationship to the Fabric Element MIB

   The Fabric Element MIB, RFC 2837 is assumed for FC functionality
   managed objects.

-- The FCIP static route table contains information about this FCIP
-- device's routing information that is created by the Network Admin.
-- In the absence of dynamic discovery of remote FCIP entities, the
-- Network Manager will figure out all the remote FCIP devices that
-- are reachable from this device, and populate this table with FCIP
-- link information for each Domain Id.
