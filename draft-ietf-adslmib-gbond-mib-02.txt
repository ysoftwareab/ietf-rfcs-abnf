1.  Introduction

   The xDSL Multi-Pair Bonding, allows a service provider to provide
   high bandwidth services to business and residential customers over
   multiple xDSL lines, with greater speed and resiliency, than the
   service over a single xDSL line, bridging the gap between xDSL and
   fiber-based transport.

   There are three xDSL Multi-Pair Bonding schemes, also known under
   collective name G.Bond:

   o  The ATM-Based Multi-Pair Bonding, specified in ITU-T G.998.1
      recommendation [G.998.1], which defines a method for bonding (or
      aggregating) of multiple xDSL lines (or individual bearer channels
      in multiple xDSL lines) into a single bi-directional logical link
      carrying an ATM stream.  This specification can be viewed as an
      evolution of the legacy Inverse Multiplexing over ATM (IMA)
      technology [af-phy-0086], applied to xDSL with variable rates on
      each line/bearer channel.

   o  The Ethernet-Based Multi-Pair Bonding, specified in ITU-T G.998.2
      recommendation [G.998.2], which defines a method for bonding (or
      aggregating) of multiple xDSL lines (or individual bearer channels
      in multiple xDSL lines) into a single bi-directional logical link
      carrying an Ethernet stream.  This specification can be viewed as
      IEEE 802.3-2005 [802.3] Clause 61 Physical Medium Entity (PME)
      Aggregation, generalized to work over any xDSL technology.
      (2Base-TL and 10Pass-TS interfaces defined by IEEE use G.SHDSL and
      VDSL technology respectively).

   o  The Multi-pair bonding using time-division inverse multiplexing
      (TDIM), specified in ITU-T G.998.3 recommendation [G.998.3], which
      defines a method for bonding (or aggregating) of multiple xDSL
      lines into a single bi-directional logical link carrying a mix of
      various traffic streams (e.g., Ethernet, ATM, TDM).

   Architecturally all three bonding schemes define a new "bonded"
   Transport Protocol Specific - Transmission Convergence (TPS-TC) sub-
   layer, stacked above multiple ATM-TC, Ethernet/PTM-TC or STM-TC
   (clear channel) sub-layers for the ATM, Ethernet or TDIM bonding
   respectively.  Each underlying TPS-TC sub-layer represents a protocol
   specific gamma-interface to an xDSL line or an individual bearer
   channel of an xDSL line.  Bonding of multiple bearer channels in the
   same xDSL line is not allowed.

   All schemes allow bonding of up to 32 individual line/channel sub-
   layers with variable rates, providing common functionality for the
   configuration, initialization, operation and monitoring of the bonded

   link.

   This document defines a MIB module common to all 3 schemes.
   Additional managed objects, specific to each bonding technology, are
   defined in GBOND-ATM-MIB [I-D.ietf-adslmib-gbond-atm-mib], GBOND-ETH-
   MIB [I-D.ietf-adslmib-gbond-eth-mib] and GBOND-TDIM-MIB
   [I-D.ietf-adslmib-gbond-tdim-mib] modules.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This document specifies a
   MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD
   58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC
   2580 [RFC2580].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  The DSL Forum Management Framework for xDSL Bonding

   This document makes use of the DSL Forum technical report Management
   Framework for xDSL Bonding [WT-159], defining a management model and
   a hierarchy of management objects for the bonded xDSL interfaces.

4.  Relationship to Other MIB modules

   This section outlines the relationship of the MIB modules defined in
   this document with other MIB modules described in the relevant RFCs.
   Specifically, the following MIB modules are discussed: Interfaces
   Group MIB (IF-MIB), Inverse Stack Table MIB (IF-INVERTED-STACK-MIB)
   Interface Stack Capability MIB (IF-CAP-STACK-MIB), G.Bond scheme
   specific modules: G.Bond/ATM (GBOND-ATM-MIB), G.Bond/Ethernet (GBOND-
   ETH-MIB) and G.Bond/TDIM (GBOND-TDIM-MIB), and DSL specific MIB
   modules: ADSL (ADSL-LINE-EXT-MIB), ADSL2 (ADSL2-LINE-MIB), SHDSL
   (HDSL2-SHDSL-LINE-MIB), VDSL (VDSL-LINE-MIB) and VDSL2 (VDSL2-LINE-
   MIB).

4.1.  Relationship to Interfaces Group MIB module

   A bonded xDSL port is a stacked (a.k.a. aggregated or bonded)
   interface and as such is managed using generic interface management
   objects defined in the IF-MIB [RFC2863].

   The stack management, i.e., actual connection of the sub-layers to
   the top layer interface, is done via the ifStackTable, as defined in
   the IF-MIB [RFC2863] and its inverse ifInvStackTable, as defined in
   the IF-INVERTED-STACK-MIB [RFC2864].

   The ifCapStackTable and its inverse ifInvCapStackTable defined in the
   IF-CAP-STACK-MIB [RFC5066], extend the stack management with an
   ability to describe possible connections or cross-connect capability,
   when a flexible cross-connect matrix is present between the interface
   layers.

4.1.1.  Layering Model

   A G.Bond interface can aggregate up to 32 channel sub-layers, with
   each channel representing an xDSL line or an xDSL bearer channel.
   For the purpose of brevity we will refer to the bonded interface as
   Generic Bonded Sub-layer (GBS) and to the channel sub-layer as
   Bonding Channel Entity (BCE).

   A generic G.Bond device can have a number of GBS ports, each
   connected to a particular upper layer (e.g., Media Access Control
   (MAC) interface for G.998.2 scheme), while simultaneously cross-
   connected to a number of underlying BCEs, with a single GBS per BCE
   relationship.

   A GBS port is represented in the Interface table (ifTable) as a
   separate interface with an ifType of g9981, g9982 or g9983 for a
   particular bonding scheme.

   Each BCE in the aggregated GBS port is represented in the ifTable as
   a separate interface with an ifType relevant to a particular xDSL
   technology, e.g., shdsl(169) or vdsl(97).  The ifType values are
   defined in [IANAifType-MIB].

   The following figure shows the layering diagram and corresponding use
   of ifTable for the bonded xDSL interfaces:

     PMS-TC - Physical Media Specific - Transmission Convergence

            Figure 1: Use of ifTable for bonded xDSL interfaces

   The ifStackTable is indexed by the ifIndex values of the aggregated
   G.Bond port (GBS) and the BCEs connected to it. ifStackTable allows a
   Network Management application to determine which BCEs are connected
   to a particular GBS and change connections (if supported by the
   application).  The ifInvStackTable, being an inverted version of the
   ifStackTable, provides an efficient means for a Network Management
   application to read a subset of the ifStackTable and thereby
   determine which GBS runs on top of a particular BCE.

   The ifCapStackTable defined in the IF-CAP-STACK-MIB module, specifies
   for each higher-layer interface (e.g., GBS port) a list of lower-
   layer interfaces (e.g., BCEs), which can possibly be cross-connected
   to that higher-layer interface, determined by the cross-connect
   capability of the device.  This table, modeled after ifStackTable, is
   read only, reflecting current cross-connect capability of a stacked
   interface, which can be dynamic in some implementations (e.g., if
   xDSL lines are located on a pluggable module and the module is pulled
   out).  Note that BCE availability per GBS, described by
   ifCapStackTable, can be constrained by other parameters, for example
   by aggregation capacity of a GBS or by the BCE in question being
   already connected to another GBS.  So, in order to ensure that a
   particular BCE can be connected to the GBS, all respective parameters
   (e.g., ifCapStackTable, ifStackTable and gBondCapacity) SHALL be
   inspected.

   The ifInvCapStackTable, also defined in the IF-CAP-STACK-MIB module,

Internet-Draft                 G.Bond MIB                 September 2008


   describes which higher-layer interfaces (e.g., GBS ports) can
   possibly be connected to a particular lower-layer interface (e.g.,
   BCE), providing inverted mapping of ifCapStackTable.  While it
   contains no additional information beyond that already contained in
   the ifCapStackTable, the ifInvCapStackTable has the ifIndex values in
   its INDEX clause in the reverse order, i.e., the lower-layer
   interface first, and the higher-layer interface second, providing an
   efficient means for a Network Management application to read a subset
   of the ifCapStackTable and thereby determine which interfaces can be
   connected to run on top of a particular interface.

4.1.2.  G.Bond Aggregation Function (GAF)

   The G.Bond Aggregation Function (GAF) allows a number of BCEs to be
   aggregated onto a single logical GBS port, by splitting the incoming
   traffic into multiple streams, transmitting each stream over a
   specific BCE and combining the streams at the remote GBS port,
   preserving the original traffic order.

   Big Ethernet frames MAY be fragmented before the transmission and
   reassembled at the remote end to minimize transportation delay.

   GAF is OPTIONAL, meaning that a device with a single BCE MAY perform
   fragmentation and re-assembly if this function is supported by the
   device.  The agent is REQUIRED to report on the GAF capability for
   all types of G.Bond ports (ATM, Ethernet and TDIM).

   The GBOND-MIB module allows a Network Management application to query
   GAF capability and enable/disable it if supported.  Note that
   enabling GAF effectively turns on fragmentation and re-assembly, even
   on a single-BCE port.

4.1.3.  Discovery Operation

   The G.Bond ports may optionally support discovery operation, whereby
   BCEs, during initialization, exchange information about their
   respective aggregation groups (GBS), via xDSL handshake protocol.
   This information can then be used to detect copper misconnections or
   for an automatic assignment of the local BCEs into aggregation groups
   instead of a fixed pre-configuration.

   The MIB module defined in this document allow a Network Management
   application to control G.Bond Discovery mechanism and query its
   results.  Note that the Discovery mechanism can work only if GAF is
   supported and enabled.

   Two tables are used by the G.Bond Discovery mechanism: ifStackTable
   and ifCapStackTable.  The following pseudo-code gives an example of

   the Discovery and automatic BCE assignment for a generic multi-GBS
   G.Bond device, located at Central Office (CO), using objects defined
   in this MIB module, IF-CAP-STACK-MIB and IF-MIB modules [Note that
   automatic BCE assignment is only shown here for the purposes of the
   example.  Fixed BCE pre-assignment, manual assignment or auto-
   assignment using an alternative internal algorithm may be chosen by a
   particular implementation]:

   // Go over all GBS ports in the CO device
   FOREACH gbs[i] IN CO_device
   { // Perform discovery and auto-assignment on GBS ports
     // with room for more Channels
     IF ( gbs[i].NumBCEs &lt; gbs[i].BondCapacity )
     { // Assign a unique 6-octets local discovery code to the GBS
       // e.g., MAC address

       { // Try to grab the remote RT_device, by writing the value
         // of the local 6 Byte discovery code to the remote
         // discovery code register (via handshake mechanism).
         // This operation is atomic Set-if-Clear action, i.e., it

         // are physically connected to the same remote RT_device

         BREAK;
       }
     }
   }

   An SNMP Agent for a G.Bond device builds ifCapStackTable and its
   inverse ifInvCapStackTable on device initialiation, according to the
   cross-connect capabilities of the device.

   Adding a BCE to the ifStackTable row for a specific GBS, involves
   actual connection of the BCE to the GBS.

   Note that GBS port does not have to be operationally 'down' for the
   connection to succeed.  In fact, a dynamic BCE addition (and removal)
   MAY be implemented with an available BCE being initialized first (by
   setting its ifAdminStatus to 'up') and then added to an operationally
   'up' GBS port, by modifying a respective ifStackTable (and respective
   ifInvStackTable) entry.

   It is RECOMMENDED that a removal of the last operationally 'up' BCE
   from an operationally 'up' GBS would be rejected by the
   implementation, as this action would completely drop the link.

   In addition to the standard handshake-based discovery described
   above, [G.998.2] defines an optional frame-based discovery and pair
   management.  These frame-based methods are discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-adslmib-gbond-eth-mib].

4.1.4.  G.Bond ports initialization

   G.Bond ports being built on top of xDSL technology, require a lengthy
   initialization or 'training' process, before any data can pass.
   During this initialization both ends of a link (peers) work
   cooperatively to achieve required data rate on a particular copper
   pair.  Sometimes, when the copper line is too long or the noise on

   the line is too high, that 'training' process may fail to achieve a
   specific target rate with required characteristics.

   The ifAdminStatus object from the IF-MIB, controls the desired state
   of a GBS with all the BCEs connected to it or of an individual BCE
   port.  Setting this object to 'up' instructs a particular GBS or a
   BCE to start initialization process, which may take tens of seconds
   for G.Bond ports.  The ifOperStatus object shows the operational
   state of an interface (extended by ifMauMediaAvailable object from
   MAU-MIB [RFC4836] for GBS and *Status object from a relevant line MIB
   for BCE interfaces).

   A disconnected BCE may be initialized by changing the ifAdminState
   from 'down' to 'up'.  Changing the ifAdminState to 'up' on the GBS
   initializes all BCEs connected to that particular GBS.  Note that in
   case of bonding some interfaces may fail to initialize while others
   succeed.  The GBS is considered operationally 'up' if at least one
   bonded BCE is operationally 'up'.  When all BCEs connected to the GBS
   are 'down' the GBS SHALL be considered operationally
   'lowerLayerDown'.  The GBS SHALL be considered operationally
   'notPresent' if it is not connected to any BCE.  The GBS/BCE
   interface SHALL remain operationally 'down' during initialization.

4.1.5.  Usage of ifTable

   Both BCE and GBS interfaces are managed using interface specific
   management objects defined in the GBOND-MIB module and generic
   interface objects from the ifTable of IF-MIB, with all management
   table entries referenced by the interface index ifIndex.

   The following table summarizes G.Bond specific interpretations for
   some of the ifTable objects specified by the mandatory
   ifGeneralInformationGroup:

   +---------------+---------------------------------------------------+
   | IF-MIB object | G.Bond interpretation                             |
   +---------------+---------------------------------------------------+
   | ifIndex       | Interface index. Note that each BCE and each GBS  |
   |               | in the G.Bond PHY MUST have a unique index, as    |
   |               | there some GBS and BCE specific attributes        |
   |               | accessible only on the GBS or BCE level.          |
   +---------------+---------------------------------------------------+
   | ifType        | g9981, g9982 or g9982 for the ATM, Ethernet or    |
   |               | TDIM GBS respectively, shdsl(169) for G.SHDSL     |
   |               | BCE, vdsl(97) for VDSL BCE etc.                   |

   |               | downstream one) the lowest of the values is       |

4.2.  Relationship to xDSL MIB modules

   Each xDSL technology is described in a relevant xDSL line MIB module:
   e.g., HDSL2-SHDSL-LINE-MIB [RFC4319] for G.SHDSL, ADSL-LINE-EXT-MIB
   [RFC3440] for ADSL, ADSL2-LINE-MIB [RFC4706] for ADSL2, VDSL-LINE-MIB
   [RFC3728] for VDSL or VDSL2-LINE-MIB [I-D.ietf-adslmib-vdsl2-mib] for
   VDSL2.

   These MIBs are used to manage individual xDSL lines/channels (BCEs).

5.  MIB Structure

5.1.  Overview

   The main management objects defined in the GBOND-MIB module are split
   into 2 groups:

   o  gBondPort - containing objects for configuration, capabilities,
      status and notifications, common to all G.Bond ports (GBS).

   o  gBondBce - containing a single common object for configuration of
      the remote discovery code per BCE.  Note that the rest of the
      objects for BCE configuration, capabilities, status and
      notifications, is located in relevant xDSL line MIB modules as
      well as in the bonding scheme specific MIB modules.

       DESCRIPTION
         "The objects in this MIB module are used to manage the
         multi-pair bonded xDSL Interfaces, defined in ITU-T
         recommendations G.998.1, G.998.2 and G.998.3.

         This MIB module MUST be used in conjunction with a bonding
         scheme specific MIB module, that is, GBOND-ATM-MIB,
         GBOND-ETH-MIB or GBOND-TDIM-MIB.

         The following references are used throughout this MIB module:

         [G.998.1] refers to:
           ITU-T Recommendation G.998.1: 'ATM-based multi-pair bonding',
           January 2005.

         [G.998.2] refers to:
           ITU-T Recommendation G.998.2: 'Ethernet-based multi-pair
           bonding', January 2005.

         [G.998.3] refers to:
           ITU-T Recommendation G.998.3: 'Multi-pair bonding using
           time-division inverse multiplexing', January 2005.

         [WT-159] refers to:

7.  Security Considerations

   There is a number of managed objects defined in the GBOND-MIB module
   that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write or read-create.  Most
   objects are writeable only when the link is Down.  Writing to these
   objects can have potentially disruptive effects on network operation,
   for example:

   o  Changing of gBondAdminScheme MAY lead to a potential locking of
      the link, if the peer device does not support desired bonding
      scheme.

   o  Changing of gBondDiscoveryCode, before the discovery operation,
      MAY lead to a wrongful discovery, for example when two CO ports
      are connected to the same multi-channel RT port, while both CO

Internet-Draft                 G.Bond MIB                 September 2008


      ports have the same Discovery register value.

   o  Changing GBS configuration parameters (e.g., profile of a GBS via
      gBondAdminProfile) MAY lead to anything from link quality and rate
      degradation to a complete link initialization failure, as ability
      of an G.Bond port to support a particular configuration depends on
      the copper environment.

   o  Activation of a specific line/channel MAY cause a severe
      degradation of service for another G.Bond port, whose channel(s)
      MAY be affected by the cross-talk from the newly activated
      channel.

   o  Removal of a channel from an operationally 'up' G.Bond port,
      aggregating several channels, MAY cause port's rate degradation

   The user of the GBOND-MIB module must therefore be aware that support
   for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
   protection can have a negative effect on network operations.

   The readable objects in the GBOND-MIB module (i.e., those with MAX-
   ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive in some
   environments since, collectively, they provide information about the
   performance of network interfaces and can reveal some aspects of
   their configuration.  In particular, since a bonded xDSL port can be
   comprised of multiple Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP) voice grade
   copper, located in the same bundle with other pairs belonging to
   another operator/customer, it is theoretically possible to evasdrop
   to a G.Bond transmission, simply by "listening" to a cross-talk from
   the bonded pairs, especially if the parameters of the G.Bond link in
   question are known.

   In such environments it is important to control also GET and NOTIFY
   access to these objects and possibly even to encrypt their values
   when sending them over the network via SNMP.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT

   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

8.  IANA Considerations

   Three new values of IANAifType: g9981, g9982 and g9982 SHALL be
   defined by the IANA [1] in the IANAifType-MIB module
   [IANAifType-MIB], before this document is published as an RFC.

   Additionally, an object identifier for gBondMIB MODULE-IDENTITY SHALL
   be allocated by IANA in the MIB-2 transmission sub-tree, before this
   document is published.
