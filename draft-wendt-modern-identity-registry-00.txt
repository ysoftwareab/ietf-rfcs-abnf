                       Identity Registry (idreg)
                draft-wendt-modern-identity-registry-00

Abstract

   This document will describe an approach for how a distributed
   identity registry model might look.  It will consider both public
   registry components of the data model necessary for routing calls
   from one globally routable identity to another.  It will also
   consider part of the private registry components a provider may need
   to manage associations with users or customers.  Other topics include
   provider associations, application or service association, and the
   ability to support multiple identities associated with a user/
   subscriber (e.g. telephone number and e-mail identity).

1.  Introduction

   There are many useful VoIP and user to user communications
   applications that desire the ability to provide services that don't
   depend on a single entity or provider to manage the end-to-end
   identities associated with that application.  For example, using the
   VoIP protocol, SIP [RFC3261], the telephone network provides a
   federated mechanism that using a publicly known identity, the
   telephone number, a customer of a telephone provider A can call a
   customer of telephone provider B based on managed routing databases
   and routing rules.  XMPP [RFC6120] is another example of a protocol
   that allowed federation of communications based on the username and
   domain of the host of the XMPP server.  Each of these examples uses
   service specific databases or registries that are generally protocol
   or application specific, however today application providers general
   provide many applications or services for a user which generally
   share the use of common communications identities like telephone
   numbers, e-mail identities, or identities associated with web based
   IdPs.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Overview

   The identity registry model proposed in this document supports the
   model where there are a few actors in the model relevant to providing
   communications services.

   o  Provider - An entity that provide a service to customers and
      manages there identity in the network.

   o  User/Subscriber - The entity that is using the services of the
      provider.

   o  Service Identity - A globally unique identifier representing a
      application or service being made available to users/subscribers
      by multiple providers.

   o  Public Identity - A publicly known identity that the user
      associates with a service.  This identity must be globally unique
      to a user/subscriber.  It must also be provably associated to a
      given user/subscriber that claims the association.

   o  Routing Identity - A uniquely and globally routable identity used
      specifically in signaling calls between users.

   This data model can be used to build the shared data between
   providers that support the federated service in order for users that
   are associated with one provider to call another provider.

3.2.  Other identity registry attributes

   The identity registry MUST support functions such as the following:

   o  The ability to query for available/unused identities for the
      purposes of either identifying conflicts before committing to the
      registry or identify unused identities that are part of a pool
      (e.g. telephone numbers)

   o  The ability to allocate identities for future use at individual
      levels or at block levels, such as NPA-NXX level telephone numbers
      or perhaps wildcard identities, e.g. *@example.com.

Internet-Draft                    idreg                     October 2016


   o  The ability to update/transfer/port identities from one provider
      to another provider.

   o  The ability to digitally sign transactions to a provider for
      validation of legitimate transactions.  Or forensic analysis of
      illegitimate transactions.

   It is anticipated that this identity registry would be used with
   [I-D.wendt-modern-drip] for supporting a continuously and timely
   updated local registry for a given service identity the provider is
   offering.

4.  Message and Control Flows

4.1.  Queries

   Typical queries for finding a globally routable identity should be in
   the context of a public identity and service identity for an
   allocated routing identity.

4.2.  Allocation/Assignment

   When a provider customer has decided to allocate a given single or
   block level set of telephone numbers there is a PUT command that
   allocates the number, given the number wasn't already allocated
   between the GET and the PUT.  As a result of a successful allocation,
   the telephone number will be removed from the unallocated bucket.

4.2.1.  Example

   As part of the allocation, the service provider will be required to
   provide following information:

   o  publicID: telephone number in e.164 format (e.g., +12155551212).

   o  serviceID: "voip" by default, other services potentially in
      future.

   o  routingID: SIP URI with telephone number + domain representing
      service provider of record (e.g.,
      sip:+12155551212@voip.example.com).

   o  timestamp: a timestamp retrieved from a common NTP server
      representing time of allocation, used for validating which service
      provider allocated first in race condition scenarios, and just for
      logging and historical reference in general.

   o  x5u: used for validation of signature

Internet-Draft                    idreg                     October 2016


   o  signature: using a provider level [RFC5280] based private key/
      certificate, the provider MUST sign the information above to
      validate the change to the registry.

4.3.  Update Entry/Port

   If a provider needs to update information related to an allocated
   entry, such as adding a publicID, modify routingID, etc.  or if there
   is a port where a new service provider will overwrite the entry with
   new information, the API should be the same.

   There is a GET operation to read the current entry information, if
   the provider needs this information, (e.g., read/modify/write).
   There also is a PUT operation that will write the updated entry
   information.  This will require a new timestamp and signature to
   validate the security of the operation and logging/historical
   purposes.

4.4.  Removal/de-allocation

   If a provider wants to remove an entry for the case where a customer
   removes his service and no longer wants to own or associate a public
   identity, a DELETE operation will be provided that will delete the
   entry, and for the case of a telephone number, will put the telephone
   number back in the pool of unallocated numbers.

5.  Security Considerations

   TBD
