   Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six
   months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other

Authors' Note:

   This memo documents the parameters used in the Multiple Access
   Protocol over SONET/SDH Version 1.  This document is NOT the product
   of an IETF working group nor is it a standards track document.  It
   has not necessarily benefited from the widespread and in-depth
   community review that standards track documents receive.

Abstract

   This document describes the protocol parameters used in the Multiple
   Access Over SONET/SDH (MAPOS) version 1. MAPOS is a link layer
   protocol and provides multiple access capability over SONET/SDH
   links.

1. Introduction

   Multiple Access Protocol over SONET/SDH (MAPOS) [1] is a high-speed
   link-layer protocol that provides multiple access capability over
   SONET(Synchronous Optical Network)/SDH(Synchronous Digital
   Hierarchy)[2][3][4][5]. Its frame format is based on the HDLC-like
   framing [6] for PPP.  A component called ``Frame Switch'' [1] allows
   multiple nodes to be connected together in a star topology to form a
   LAN. Using long haul SONET/SDH links, the nodes on such a ``SONET-
   LAN'' can span over a wide geographical area. The Internet Protocol
   (IP) [7] datagrams are transmitted in MAPOS HDLC frames [8].

   This document describes the protocol parameters used in MAPOS version
   1 [1].

2. Protocol Field Assignments

   The MAPOS Version 1 Data Link Layer [1] contains a 16 bit Protocol
   field to identify the the encapsulated protocol.  The Protocol field
   is consistent with the ISO 3309 (HDLC) extension mechanism for
   address fields.  All protocol numbers MUST be assigned such that the
   least significant bit of the most significant octet equals "0", and
   the least significant bit of the least significant octet equals "1".

3. Address Resolution Protocol Parameters

   This section explains the parameters for MAPOS ARP [8].  An
   implementation MUST provide an UNARP mechanism to flush obsolete ARP
   cache entries[8].
