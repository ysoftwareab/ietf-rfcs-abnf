Internet-Draft     A Framework for Automatic TE of AS         March 2010


Abstract

   This document describes a framework for automatic traffic engineering
   of autonomous system (AS).  Automatic traffic engineering aims to
   automatically control incoming traffic.  The framework in this
   document provides roles of each element and a communication model
   between the elements for realizing automatic traffic engineering.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].

Internet-Draft     A Framework for Automatic TE of AS         March 2010


1.  Introduction

   BGP protocol[2] is used by operators of AS for controlling traffic
   which comes in the AS.  To realize appropriate traffic engineering,
   operators have to set up configuration of BGP router in the AS
   appropriately.  It is difficult for the operators to control incoming
   traffic fluctuating moment by moment.  This increases operating cost
   of AS.

   This document describes a framework for automatic traffic engineering
   of autonomous system (AS).  Automatic traffic engineering aims to
   automatically control incoming traffic.  The framework in this
   document provides roles of each element and a communication model
   between the elements for realizing automatic traffic engineering.


2.  Communication Model



                 Incoming +--------+ Traffic  +--------+
                  Traffic |        |  Info.   |        |
                     ---> |  eBGP  |  ---->   |        |
                eBGP peer | Router | TE Ctrl. |        |
                    <---> |        |  <----   |        |
                          +--------+          |   TE   |
                 Incoming +--------+ Traffic  | Server |
                  Traffic |        |  Info.   |        |
                     ---> |  eBGP  |  ---->   |        |
                eBGP peer | Router | TE Ctrl. |        |
                    <---> |        |  <----   |        |
                          +--------+          +--------+

2.1.  Traffic Information

   Traffic information is information of traffic which comes in from
   neighbor AS.  The traffic information is made by eBGP router, and is
   sent to TE server.

   Traffic information may be sampled flow data, e.g.  IP Traffic Flow
   information for IPFIX protocol [3], or summarized data of flow
   information, e.g.  MIB data for SNMP [4].  Specifications of the
   traffic information is concretely defined by the other documents.

2.2.  TE Control Message

   TE control message is used by TE server to control BGP messages which
   eBGP router sends to peer.

   TE control message may be iBGP message, NETCONF [5], or command of
   CLI over SSH [6].  Specifications of the TE control message is
   concretely defined by the other documents.


3.  Role of Element

3.1.  eBGP Router

   All eBGP routers in the autonomous system make traffic information ,
   and send the traffic information to TE Server.

   The eBGP routers receive TE control message from TE server, send BGP
   message to eBGP peer according to the TE control message.

3.2.  TE Server

   TE server receives traffic information which eBGP router sends and
   analyze the traffic information.  Then, the TE server makes TE
   control message according to the result of analysis, and sends the TE
   control message to eBGP routers.

   This document doesn't treat the concrete algorithm for analyzing
   traffic information.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not raise any IANA consideration issues.


5.  Security Considerations

   For communication between each element, this framework uses existing
   standard protocols(e.g.  BGP).  This framework does not change the
   security issues of these protocols.


6.  Acknowledgments

   The work was partly supported by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and
   Communications, Japan.
