            IPv6 Prefix Length Recommendation for Forwarding
                    draft-ietf-v6ops-cidr-prefix-02

Abstract

   IPv6 prefix length, as in IPv4, is a parameter conveyed and used in
   IPv6 routing and forwarding processes in accordance with the
   Classless Inter-domain Routing (CIDR) architecture.  The length of an
   IPv6 prefix may be any number from zero to 128, although subnets
   using stateless address autoconfiguration (SLAAC) for address
   allocation conventionally use a /64 prefix.  Hardware and software
   implementations of routing and forwarding should therefore impose no
   rules on prefix length, but implement longest-match-first on prefixes
   of any valid length.

1.  Introduction

   Discussions on the 64-bit boundary in IPv6 addressing ([RFC7421])
   revealed a need for a clear recommendation on which bits must be used
   by forwarding decision-making processes.  However, such a
   recommendation was out of scope for that document.

   Although Section 2.5 of [RFC4291] states "IPv6 unicast addresses are
   aggregatable with prefixes of arbitrary bit-length, similar to IPv4
   addresses under Classless Inter-Domain Routing" (CIDR, [RFC4632]),
   there is still a misinterpretation that IPv6 prefixes can be either
   /127 ([RFC6164]) or any length up to /64.  This (mis)interpretation
   is mainly induced by the 64-bit boundary in IPv6 addressing.

   As discussed in [RFC7421], "the notion of a /64 boundary in the
   address was introduced after the initial design of IPv6, following a
   period when it was expected to be at /80".  This evolution of the
   IPv6 Addressing architecture, resulting in [RFC4291], and followed
   with the addition of /127 prefixes for point-to-point links, clearly
   demonstrates the intent for future IPv6 developments to have the
   flexibility to change this part of the architecture when justified.

   It is fundamental to not link routing and forwarding to the IPv6
   prefix/address semantics [RFC4291].  This document includes a
   recommendation for that aim.

   Forwarding decisions rely on the longest-match-first algorithm, which
   stipulates that, given a choice between two prefixes in the
   Forwarding Information Base (FIB) of different length that match the
   destination address in each bit up to their respective lengths, the
   longer prefix is used.  This document's recommendation (Section 2) is
   that IPv6 forwarding must follow the longest-match-first rule,
   regardless of prefix length, barring the configuration of some
   overriding policy.

   This recommendation does not conflict with the 64-bit boundary for
   some IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration (SLAAC, [RFC4862])
   based schemes such as [RFC2464].  Indeed, [RFC7421] clarifies this is
   only a parameter in the SLAAC process and other longer prefix lengths
   are in operational use (e.g., either manually configured or based
   upon DHCPv6 [RFC3315]).

   A historical reminder of CIDR is documented in [RFC1380] and
   Section 2 of [RFC4632].

2.  Recommendation

   IPv6 implementations MUST conform to the rules specified in
   Section 5.1 of [RFC4632].

   Forwarding decision-making processes MUST NOT restrict the length of
   IPv6 prefixes by design.  In particular, forwarding processes MUST be
   designed to process prefixes of any length up to /128, by increments
   of 1.

   Obviously, policies can be enforced to restrict the length of IP
   prefixes advertised within a given domain or in a given
   interconnection link.  These policies are deployment-specific and/or
   driven by administrative (interconnection) considerations.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any action from IANA.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce security issues in addition to what
   is discussed in [RFC4291].
