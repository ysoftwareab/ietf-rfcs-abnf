        Making Route-Servers Aware of Data Link Failures at IXPs
                        draft-ymbk-idr-rs-bfd-00

Abstract

   When route servers are used, the data plane is not congruent with the
   control plane.  Therefore, the peers on the Internet exchange can
   lose data connectivity without the control plane being aware of it,
   and packets are dropped on the floor.  This document proposes the use
   of BFD between the two peering routers to detect a data plane
   failure, and then uses BGP next hop cost to signal the state of the
   data link to the route server(s).

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",

1.  Introduction

   In configurations (typically Internet exchanges) where EBGP routing
   information is exchanged between client routers through the agency of
   a route server [I-D.ietf-idr-ix-bgp-route-server], but traffic is
   exchanged directly, operational issues can arise when partial data
   plane connectivity exists among the route server client routers.
   This is because, as the data plane is not congruent with the control
   plane, the client routers on the Internet exchange can lose data
   connectivity without the control plane - the route server - being
   aware of it, and packets are dropped on the floor.

   To remedy this, two basic problems need to be solved:

   1.  Client routers must have a means of verifying connectivity
   amongst themselves, and

   2.  Client routers must have a means of communicating the knowledge
   so gained back to the route server.

   The first can be solved by application of Bidirectional Forwarding
   Detection [RFC5880].  The second can be solved by use of BGP NH-SAFI
   [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-nh-cost].  There is a subsidiary problem that must
   also be solved.  Since one of the key value propositions offered by a
   route server is that client routers need not be configured to peer
   with each other:

   3.  Client routers must have a means (other than configuration) to
   know of one another's existence.

   This can also be solved by an application of BGP NH-SAFI.

   Throughout this document, we generally assume that the route server
   being discussed is able to represent different RIBs towards different
   clients, as discussed in section 2.3.2.1.
   [I-D.ietf-idr-ix-bgp-route-server].  These procedures (other than the
   use of BFD to track next hop reachability) have limited value if this
   is not the case.

2.  Operation

   Below, we detail procedures where a route server tells its client
   routers about other client routers (by sending it their next hops
   using NH-SAFI), the client router verifies connectivity to those
   other client routers (using BFD) and communicates its findings back
   to the route server (again using NH-SAFI).  The route server uses the
   received NH-SAFI routes as input to the route selection process it
   performs on behalf of the client.

2.1.  Mutual Discovery of Route Server Client Routers

   Strictly speaking, what is needed is not for a route server client
   router to know of other (control-plane) client routers, but rather to
   know (so that it can validate) all the next hops the route server
   might choose to send the client router, i.e. to know of potential
   forwarding plane relationships.

   In effect, this requirement amounts to knowing the BGP next hops the
   route server is aware of in its Adj-RIBs-In.  Fortunately,
   [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-nh-cost] defines a construct that contains exactly
   this data, the "Next-Hop Information Base", or NHIB, as well as
   procedures for a BGP speaker to communicate its NHIB to its peer.
   Thus, the problem can be solved by the route server advertising its
   NHIB to its client router, following those procedures.

   We observe that (as per NH-SAFI) the cost advertised in the route
   server's Adj-NHIB-Out need not reflect a "real" IGP cost, the only
   requirement being that the advertised costs are commensurate.  A
   route server MAY choose to advertise any fixed cost other than all-
   ones (which is a reserved value in NH-SAFI).  This specification does
   not suggest semantics be imputed to the NH-SAFI advertised by the
   route server and received by the client, other than "this next hop is
   present in the control plane, you might like to track it".  The route
   server is not allowed to advertise a next hop as NH_UNREACHABLE.

   A route server client should use BFD (or other means beyond the scope
   of this document) to track forwarding plane connectivity [RFC5880] to
   each next hop depicted in the received NH-SAFI.

2.2.  Tracking Connectivity

   For each next hop in the Adj-NHIB-In received from the route server,
   the client router SHOULD use some means to confirm that data plane
   connectivity does exist to that next hop.

   One way that is highly recommended is the use of BFD in echo mode.
   Authentication may or may not be used.  For each next hop in the Adj-
   NHIB-In received from the route server, the client router SHOULD
   setup a BFD session to it if not one is already available and track
   the reachability of this next hop.

   For each next hop being tracked, a corresponding NH-SAFI route should
   be placed in the client router's own Adj-NHIB-Out to be advertised to
   the route server.  Any next hop for which connectivity has failed
   should have its cost advertised as NH_UNREACHABLE.  (This may also be
   done as a result of policy even if connectivity exists.)  Any other
   next hop should have some feasible cost advertised.  The values
   advertised may be all equal, or may be set according to policy or
   other implementation-specific means.

   If the test of connectivity between on client router and another
   client router has failed the client router that detected this failure
   should perform connectivity test for a configurable amount of time
   (preferable 24 hours) on a regular basis (e.g., every 5 minutes).  If
   during this time no connectivity can be restored no more testing is
   performed and this client router is advertised as NH_UNREACHABLE
   until manually changed or the client router is rebooted.

   A client router tracking next hop reachability should also use that
   determination as input to its own bestpath determination, as per
   section 9.1 [RFC4271].

3.  Advertising Client Router Connectivity to the Route Server

   As discussed above, a client router will advertise its Adj-NHIB-Out
   to the route server.  The route server should use this information as
   input to its own decision process when computing the Adj-RIB-Out for
   this peer.  This peer-dependent Adj-RIB-Out is then be advertised to
   this peer.  In particular, the route server MUST exclude any routes
   whose next hops the client has declared to be NH_UNREACHABLE.  The
   route server MAY also consider the advertised cost to be the "IGP
   cost" section 9.1 [RFC4271] when doing this computation.

4.  Bootstraping

   If the route server starts it does not know anything about
   connectivity states between client routers.  So, the route server
   assumes optimistically that all client routers are able to reach each
   other unless told otherwise.

5.  Other Considerations

   For purposes of routing stability, implementations may wish to apply
   hysteresis ("holddown") to next hops that have transitioned from
   reachable to unreachable and back.
