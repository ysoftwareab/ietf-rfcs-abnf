                draft-ietf-ospf-ospfv3-autoconfig-15.txt

Abstract

   OSPFv3 is a candidate for deployments in environments where auto-
   configuration is a requirement.  One such environment is the IPv6
   home network where users expect to simply plug in a router and have
   it automatically use OSPFv3 for intra-domain routing.  This document
   describes the necessary mechanisms for OSPFv3 to be self-configuring.
   This document updates RFC 5340 by relaxing the HelloInterval/
   RouterDeadInterval checking during OSPFv3 adjacency formation and
   adding hysteresis to the update of self-originated Link State
   Advertisements (LSAs).

1.  Introduction

   OSPFv3 [OSPFV3] is a candidate for deployments in environments where
   auto-configuration is a requirement.  This document describes
   extensions to OSPFv3 to enable it to operate in these environments.
   In this mode of operation, the protocol is largely unchanged from the
   base OSPFv3 protocol specification [OSPFV3].  Since the goals of
   auto-configuration and security can be conflicting, operators and
   network administrators should carefully consider their security
   requirements before deploying the solution described in this
   document.  Refer to Section 8 for more information.

   The following aspects of OSPFv3 auto-configuration are described in
   this document:

Internet-Draft          OSPFv3 Auto-Configuration          February 2015


   1.  Default OSPFv3 Configuration

   2.  HelloInterval/RouterDeadInterval Flexibility

   3.  Unique OSPFv3 Router ID generation

   4.  OSPFv3 Adjacency Formation

   5.  Duplicate OSPFv3 Router ID Resolution

   6.  Self-Originated LSA Processing

   OSPFv3 [OSPFV3] is updated by allowing OSPFv3 adjacencies to be
   formed between OSPFv3 routers with differing HelloIntervals or
   RouterDeadIntervals (refer to Section 3).  Additionally, hysteresis
   has been added to the processing of stale self-originated LSAs to
   mitigate the flooding overhead created by an OSPFv3 Router with a
   duplicate OSPFv3 Router ID in the OSPFv3 routing domain (refer to
   Section 7.4.  Both updates are fully backward compatible.

1.1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-KEYWORDS].

2.  OSPFv3 Default Configuration

   For complete auto-configuration, OSPFv3 will need to choose suitable
   configuration defaults.  These include:

   1.  Area 0 Only - All auto-configured OSPFv3 interfaces MUST be in
       area 0.

   2.  OSPFv3 SHOULD be auto-configured on all IPv6-capable interface on
       the router.  An interface MAY be excluded if it is clear that
       running OSPFv3 on the interface is not required.  For example, if
       manual configuration or another condition indicates that an
       interface is connected to an Internet Service Provider (ISP),
       there is typically no need to employ OSPFv3.  In fact, [IPv6-CPE]
       specifically requires that IPv6 Customer Premise Equipment (CPE)
       routers do not initiate any dynamic routing protocol by default
       on the router's WAN, i.e., ISP-facing, interface.  In home
       networking environments, an interface where no OSPFv3 neighbors
       are found but a DHCP IPv6 prefix can be acquired may be
       considered an ISP-facing interface and running OSPFv3 is
       unnecessary.

   3.  OSPFv3 interfaces will be auto-configured to an interface type
       corresponding to their layer-2 capability.  For example, Ethernet
       interfaces and Wi-Fi interfaces will be auto-configured as OSPFv3
       broadcast networks and Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) interfaces
       will be auto-configured as OSPFv3 Point-to-Point interfaces.
       Most extant OSPFv3 implementations do this already.  Auto-
       configured operation over wireless networks requiring a point-to-
       multipoint (P2MP) topology and dynamic metrics based on wireless
       feedback is not within the scope of this document.  However,
       auto-configuration is not precluded in these environments.

   4.  OSPFv3 interfaces MAY use an arbitrary HelloInterval and
       RouterDeadInterval as specified in Section 3.  Of course, an
       identical HelloInterval and RouterDeadInterval will still be
       required to form an adjacency with an OSPFv3 router not
       supporting auto-configuration [OSPFV3].

   5.  All OSPFv3 interfaces SHOULD be auto-configured to use an
       Interface Instance ID of 0 that corresponds to the base IPv6
       unicast address family instance ID as defined in [OSPFV3-AF].
       Similarly, if IPv4 unicast addresses are advertised in a separate
       auto-configured OSPFv3 instance, the base IPv4 unicast address
       family instance ID value, i.e., 64, SHOULD be auto-configured as
       the Interface Instance ID for all interfaces corresponding to the
       IPv4 unicast OSPFv3 instance [OSPFV3-AF].

3.  OSPFv3 HelloInterval/RouterDeadInterval Flexibility

   Auto-configured OSPFv3 routers will not require an identical
   HelloInterval and RouterDeadInterval to form adjacencies.  Rather,
   the received HelloInterval will be ignored and the received
   RouterDeadInterval will be used to determine OSPFv3 liveliness with
   the sending router.  In other words, the Neighbor Inactivity Timer
   (Section 10 of [OSPFV2]) for each neighbor will reflect that
   neighbor's advertised RouterDeadInterval and MAY be different from
   other OSPFv3 routers on the link without impacting adjacency
   formation.  A similar mechanism requiring additional signaling is
   proposed for all OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 routers [ASYNC-HELLO].

3.1.  Wait Timer Reduction

   In many situations, auto-configured OSPFv3 routers will be deployed
   in environments where back-to-back ethernet connections are utilized.
   When this is the case, an OSPFv3 broadcast interface will not come up
   until the other OSPFv3 router is connected and the routers will wait
   RouterDeadInterval seconds before forming an adjacency [OSPFV2].  In
   order to reduce this delay, an auto-configured OSPFv3 router MAY
   reduce the wait interval to a value no less than (HelloInterval + 1).

   Reducing the setting will slightly increase the likelihood of the
   Designated Router (DR) flapping but is preferable to the long
   adjacency formation delay.  Note that this value is not included in
   OSPFv3 Hello packets and does not impact interoperability.

4.  OSPFv3 Minimal Authentication Configuration

   In many deployments, the requirement for OSPFv3 authentication
   overrides the goal of complete OSPFv3 autoconfiguration.  Therefore,
   it is RECOMMENDED that OSPFv3 routers supporting this specification
   minimally offer an option to explicitly configure a single password
   for HMAC-SHA authentication as described in [OSPFV3-AUTH-TRAILER].
   It is RECOMMENDED that the password entered as ASCII hexadecimal
   digits and that 32 or more digits to facilitate a password with a
   high degree of entropy.  When configured, the password will be used
   on all auto-configured interfaces with the Security Association
   Identifier (SA ID) set to 1 and HMAC-SHA-256 used as the
   authentication algorithm.

5.  OSPFv3 Router ID Selection

   An OSPFv3 router requires a unique Router ID within the OSPFv3
   routing domain for correct protocol operation.  Existing Router ID
   selection algorithms (section C.1 in [OSPFV2] and [OSPFV3]) are not
   viable since they are dependent on a unique IPv4 interface address
   which is not likely to be available in autoconfigured deployments.
   An OSPFv3 router implementing this specification will select a
   router-id that has a high probability of uniqueness.  A pseudo-random
   number SHOULD be used for the OSPFv3 Router ID.  The generation
   SHOULD be seeded with a variable that is likely to be unique in the
   applicable OSPFv3 router deployment.  A good choice of seed would be
   some portion or hash of the Router-Hardware-Fingerprint as described
   in Section 7.2.2.

   Since there is a possibility of a Router ID collision, duplicate
   Router ID detection and resolution are required as described in
   Section 7 and Section 7.3.  OSPFv3 routers SHOULD maintain the last
   successfully chosen Router ID in non-volatile storage to avoid
   collisions subsequent to when an autoconfigured OSPFv3 router is
   first added to the OSPFv3 routing domain.

6.  OSPFv3 Adjacency Formation

   Since OSPFv3 uses IPv6 link-local addresses for all protocol messages
   other than messages sent on virtual links (which are not applicable
   to auto-configuration), OSPFv3 adjacency formation can proceed as
   soon as a Router ID has been selected and the IPv6 link-local address
   has completed Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) as specified in IPv6

   Stateless Address Autoconfiguration [SLAAC].  Otherwise, the only
   changes to the OSPFv3 base specification are supporting
   HelloInterval/RouterDeadInterval flexibility as described in
   Section 3 and duplicate Router ID detection and resolution as
   described in Section 7 and Section 7.3.

7.  OSPFv3 Duplicate Router ID Detection and Resolution

   There are two cases of duplicate OSPFv3 Router ID detection.  One
   where the OSPFv3 router with the duplicate Router ID is directly
   connected and one where it is not.  In both cases, the duplicate
   resolution is for one of the routers to select a new OSPFv3 Router
   ID.

7.1.  Duplicate Router ID Detection for Neighbors

   In this case, a duplicate Router ID is detected if any valid OSPFv3
   packet is received with the same OSPFv3 Router ID but a different
   IPv6 link-local source address.  Once this occurs, the OSPFv3 router
   with the numerically smaller IPv6 link-local address will need to
   select a new Router ID as described in Section 7.3.  Note that the
   fact that the OSPFv3 router is a neighbor on a non-virtual interface
   implies that the router is directly connected.  An OSPFv3 router
   implementing this specification should assure that the inadvertent
   connection of multiple router interfaces to the same physical link is
   not misconstrued as detection of an OSPFv3 neighbor with a duplicate
   Router ID.

7.2.  Duplicate Router ID Detection for Non-Neighbors

   OSPFv3 routers implementing auto-configuration, as specified herein,
   MUST originate an Auto-Configuration (AC) Link State Advertisement
   (LSA) including the Router-Hardware-Fingerprint Type-Length-Value
   (TLV).  The Router-Hardware-Fingerprint TLV contains a variable
   length value that has a very high probability of uniquely identifying
   the advertising OSPFv3 router.  An OSPFv3 router implementing this
   specification MUST detect received Auto-Configuration LSAs with its
   Router ID specified in the LSA header.  LSAs received with the local
   OSPFv3 Router's Router ID in the LSA header are perceived as self-
   originated (see section 4.6 of [OSPFV3]).  In these received Auto-
   Configuration LSAs, the Router-Hardware-Fingerprint TLV is compared
   against the OSPFv3 Router's own router hardware fingerprint.  If the
   fingerprints are not equal, there is a duplicate Router ID conflict
   and the OSPFv3 router with the numerically smaller router hardware
   fingerprint MUST select a new Router ID as described in Section 7.3.

   This new LSA is designated for information related to OSPFv3 Auto-
   configuration and, in the future, could be used for other auto-

   configuration information, e.g., global IPv6 prefixes.  However, this
   is beyond the scope of this document.

7.2.1.  OSPFv3 Router Auto-Configuration LSA

   The OSPFv3 Auto-Configuration (AC) LSA has a function code of TBD and
   the S2/S1 bits set to 01 indicating Area Flooding Scope.  The U bit
   will be set indicating that the OSPFv3 AC LSA should be flooded even
   if it is not understood.  The Link State ID (LSID) value will be a
   integer index used to discriminate between multiple AC LSAs
   originated by the same OSPFv3 router.  This specification only
   describes the contents of an AC LSA with a Link State ID (LSID) of 0.

   The format of the TLVs within the body of an AC LSA is the same as

   The LSA payload consists of one or more nested Type/Length/Value

                                TLV Format

   The Length field defines the length of the value portion in octets
   (thus a TLV with no value portion would have a length of 0).  The TLV
   is padded to 4-octet alignment; padding is not included in the length
   field (so a 3-octet value would have a length of 3, but the total
   size of the TLV would be 8 octets).  Nested TLVs are also 32-bit
   aligned.  For example, a 1-byte value would have the length field set
   to 1, and 3 octets of padding would be added to the end of the value
   portion of the TLV.  Unrecognized types are ignored.

   The new LSA is designated for information related to OSPFv3 Auto-
   configuration and, in the future, can be used other auto-
   configuration information.

7.2.2.  Router-Hardware-Fingerprint TLV

   The Router-Hardware-Fingerprint TLV is the first TLV defined for the
   OSPFv3 Auto-Configuration (AC) LSA.  It will have type 1 and MUST be
   advertised in the LSID OSPFv3 AC LSA with an LSID of 0.  It SHOULD
   occur, at most, once and the first instance of the TLV will take
   precedence over subsequent TLV instances.  The length of the Router-
   Hardware-Fingerprint is variable but must be 32 octets or greater.
   If the Router-Hardware-Fingerprint TLV is not present as the first
   TLV, the AC-LSA is considered malformed and is ignored for the
   purposes of duplicate Router ID detection.  Additionally, the event
   SHOULD be logged.

   The contents of the hardware fingerprint MUST have an extremely high
   probability of uniqueness.  It SHOULD be constructed from the
   concatenation of a number of local values that themselves have a high
   likelihood of uniqueness, such as MAC addresses, CPU ID, or serial
   numbers.  It is RECOMMENDED that one or more available universal
   tokens (e.g., IEEE 802 48-bit MAC addresses or IEEE EUI-64
   Identifiers [EUI64]) associated with the OSPFv3 router be included in
   the hardware fingerprint.  It MUST be based on hardware attributes
   that will not change across hard and soft restarts.

   with the newly selected Router ID and a different Router-Hardware-
   Fingerprint.  If one is detected, a new Router ID should be selected
   without going through the resolution process Section 7.  After
   selecting a new Router ID, all self-originated LSAs MUST be
   reoriginated, and any OSPFv3 neighbor adjacencies MUST be
   reestablished.  The OSPFv3 router retaining the Router ID causing the
   conflict will reoriginate or purge stale any LSAs as described in
   Section 13.4 [OSPFV2].

7.4.  Change to RFC 2328 Section 13.4, 'Receiving Self-Originated LSAs'

   RFC 2328 [OSPFV2], Section 13.4, describes the processing of received
   self-originated LSAs.  If the received LSA doesn't exist, the
   receiving router will purge it from the OSPF routing domain.  If the
   LSA is newer than the version in the Link State Database (LSDB), the
   receiving router will originate a newer version by advancing the LSA
   sequence number and reoriginating.  Since it is possible for an auto-
   configured OSPFv3 router to choose a duplicate OSPFv3 Router ID,
   OSPFv3 routers implementing this specification should detect when
   multiple instances of the same self-originated LSA are purged or
   reoriginated since this is indicative of an OSPFv3 router with a
   duplicate Router ID in the OSPFv3 routing domain.  When this
   condition is detected, the OSPFv3 router SHOULD delay self-originated
   LSA processing for LSAs that have recently been purged or
   reoriginated.  This specification recommends 10 seconds as the
   interval defining recent self-originated LSA processing and an
   exponential back off of 1 to 8 seconds for the processing delay.

   This additional delay should allow for the mechanisms described in
   Section 7 to resolve the duplicate OSPFv3 Router ID conflict.

   Since this mechanism is useful in mitigating the flooding overhead
   associated with the inadvertent or malicious introduction of an
   OSPFv3 router with a duplicate Router ID into an OSPFv3 routing
   domain, it MAY be deployed outside of autoconfigured deployments.
   The detection of a self-originated LSA that is being repeated
   reoriginated or purged SHOULD be logged.

8.  Security Considerations

   A unique OSPFv3 Interface Instance ID is used for auto-configuration
   to prevent inadvertent OSPFv3 adjacency formation, see Section 2

   The goals of security and complete OSPFv3 auto-configuration are
   somewhat contradictory.  When no explicit security configuration
   takes place, auto-configuration implies that additional devices
   placed in the network are automatically adopted as a part of the
   network.  However, auto-configuration can also be combined with
   password configuration (see Section 4) or future extensions for
   automatic pairing between devices.  These mechanisms can help provide
   an automatically configured, securely routed network.

   In deployments where different authentication algorithm, per-
   interface keys, or encryption is required, OSPFv3 IPsec
   [OSPFV3-IPSEC] or alternate OSPFv3 Authentication trailer
   [OSPFV3-AUTH-TRAILER] algorithms MAY be used at the expense of
   additional configuration.  The configuration and operational
   description of such deployments is beyond the scope of this document.
   However, a deployment could always revert to explicit configuration
   as described in Section 9 for features such as IPsec, per-interface
   keys, or alternate authentication algorithms.

   The introduction, either malicious or accidental, of an OSPFv3 router
   with a duplicate Router ID is an attack point for OSPFv3 routing
   domains.  This is due to the fact that OSPFv3 routers will interpret
   LSAs advertised by the router with the same Router ID as self-
   originated LSAs and attempt to purge them from the routing domain.
   The mechanisms in Section 7.4 will mitigate the effects of
   duplication.

9.  Management Considerations

   It is RECOMMENDED that OSPFv3 routers supporting this specification
   also support explicit configuration of OSPFv3 parameters as specified
   in Appendix C of [OSPFV3].  The would allow explicit override of
   autoconfigured parameters in situations where it is required (e.g.,

Internet-Draft          OSPFv3 Auto-Configuration          February 2015


   if the deployment requires multiple OSPFv3 areas).  This is in
   addition to the authentication key configuration recommended in
   Section 4.  Additionally, it is RECOMMENDED that OSPFv3 routers
   supporting this specification allow autoconfiguration to be
   completely disabled.

   Since there is a small possibility of OSPFv3 Router ID collisions,
   manual configuration of OSPFv3 Router IDs is RECOMMENDED in OSPFv3
   routing domains where route convergence due to a router ID change is
   intolerable.

   OSPFv3 Routers supporting this specification MUST augment mechanisms
   for displaying or otherwise conveying OSPFv3 operational state to
   indicate whether or not the OSPFv3 router was autoconfigured and
   whether or not its OSPFv3 interfaces have been auto-configured.

10.  IANA Considerations

   This specification defines an OSPFv3 LSA Type for the OSPFv3 Auto-
   Configuration (AC) LSA, as described in Section 7.2.1.  The value TBD
   will be allocated from the existing "OSPFv3 LSA Function Code"
   registry for the OSPFv3 Auto-Configuration LSA.

   This specification also creates a registry for OSPFv3 Auto-
   Configuration (AC) LSA TLVs.  This registry should be placed in the
   existing OSPFv3 IANA registry, and new values can be allocated via
   IETF Review or, under exceptional circumstances, IESG Approval.
   [IANA-GUIDELINES]

   Three initial values are allocated:

   o  0 is marked as reserved.

   o  1 is Router-Hardware-Fingerprint TLV (Section 7.2.2).

   o  65535 is an Auto-configuration-Experiment-TLV, a common value that
      can be used for experimental purposes.
