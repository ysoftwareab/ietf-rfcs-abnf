1. Abstract

   The reasons and the motivation for transferring context have been
   described in [1]. The requirements for a context transfer protocol
   can be found  in [2]. In this document, we describe issues that need
   to be considered for transferring security (specifically IPsec)
   related context between access routers. While [3] has addressed
   issues  involved in IPSec feature context transfer, the scope and
   aspects included here are broader than in [3]. Some of the aspects
   that are addressed here but not in [3] are the various types of SAs

   whose context may be transferred, utilizing the user's static
   profile when available at the new access router, etc.

2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-2119].


3. Terminology

   In addition to the terms used in [1],[2],[3], we define the
   following
   terms:

        o MN - Mobile Node

        o PR - Previous AR.

        o NR - New AR.

        o FP - Forwarding Path. The path traversed by packets when they
        go from their source to destination. FP may correspond to the
        control, data or management plane.

        o PFP - Previous FP. The FP when the access router that the MN
        is connected to is PR.

        o NFP - New FP. The FP when the access router that the MN is
        connected to is NR. The destination itself may be different
        along the NFP compared to that along the PFP.

        o Data FP - The FP for packets in the data plane.

        o Control FP - The FP for packets in the control plane.

        o Management FP - The FP for packets in the management plane.

        o G - Gateway. This is an entity from which point onwards the
        FP
        to the CN remains unchanged.

        o SA - Security Association. This may be either a Data SA, a
        Control SA or a Management SA.

        o Data SA - SA that provides security services to packets in
        the
        Data FP. Such an SA may be between any two entities along the
        Data FP.

        o Control SA - SA that provides security services to packets in
        the Control FP. Such an SA may be between any two entities
        along
        the Control FP.

        o Management SA - SA that provides security services to packets
        in the Management FP. Such an SA may be between any two
        entities
        along the Management FP.


4. Introduction

   The purpose of this document is to describe issues that need to be
   considered for IPSec security context transfer. While [3] has
   addressed issues  involved in IPSec feature context transfer, the
   scope and aspects included here are broader than in [3]. Some of the
   aspects that are addressed here but not in [3] are the various types
   of SAs whose context may be transferred, utilizing the user's static
   profile when available at the new access router, etc.

   The organization of the document is as follows. Section 5 describes
   several types of Security Associations (SA) and a model for
   illustrating where/how these SAs fit in. The coverage in this
   section is illustrative, and is not meant to be exhaustive.
   Irrespective of the type of SA (whether it is described in Section 5
   or not), Section 6 describes the issues involved in IPSec security
   context for this SA.


5. Illustrating Various Types of SAs


   While discussing IPSec context transfer between ARs, in order to
   describe several types of IPSec SAs for which the IPSec context
   needs
   to be transferred, the following model is illustrative:



             +- Access Network -+  +--------------+
+--------+   |     +-----+      |  |       +----+ |   +--------------+
| Mobile |===|=====| PR  |======|==|=======| G  |=|===|       |

|        |   |                  |  |          *   |   |    (RN)      |
|        |   |     +-----+      |  |          *   |   |              |
|        |***|*****| NR  |******|**|***********   |   |              |
|        |   |     +-----+      |  |              |   |              |
+--------+   +------------------+  +--------------+   +--------------+

   In Figure 1, the line from an MN to RN denoted using "=" represents
   the previous forwarding path (PFP), while the line from the MN to RN
   denoted using "*" represents the new forwarding path (NFP). "G"
   denotes the network entity beyond which the forwarding path to RN
   remains unchanged. The case of RN representing different physical
   nodes along PFP and NFP is also subsumed by the above model.

   It may be noted that when the AR changes from PR to NR, the change
   in the forwarding path (FP) may either be marginal or significant.
   At one extreme (marginal case), G is collocated with PR, while at
   the  other extreme (significant case), G is collocated with RN. The 
   FP may  correspond to Data, Control or Management FP. When the Data
   FP is  being considered, RN corresponds to the correspondent node
   (CN). When the Control FP is being considered, RN corresponds to an
   entity with which MN exchanges control messages. Similarly, when the
   Management FP is being considered, RN corresponds to an entity with
   which MN exchanges messages in the Management plane.

   Note:

   1. The model has been generalized to accommodate data, control and
   management plane messages between the MN and a remote node. While it
   may be the case that management plane messages between MN-RN may
   either not exist or may not be of interest, the framework covers
   such
   aspects as well should they be deemed necessary in certain
   scenarios.
   2. The model may be extended to cover the case of data, control and
   management plane messages between any two entities, and not
   restricting itself to the case where one of the entities is MN. It
   may be reiterated that the model is not meant to be exhaustive, but
   is merely intended to illustrate many types of SAs whose context may
   be transferred.


5.1 Types of SAs

   For the scenario depicted in Figure 1, several types of SAs are
   possible:

   (1) Type 1 SA: Each endpoint of such an SA lies between G
   (inclusive)
   and RN (inclusive). There is no change in such SAs when the FP
   changes from PFP to NFP.
   (2) Type 2 SA: One endpoint of such an SA is at MN, while the other
   endpoint is between G (inclusive) and RN (inclusive). There is no
   change in such an SA when the FP changes from PFP to NFP.
   (3) Type 3 SA: One endpoint of such an SA is between PR (inclusive)
   and G (exclusive), while the other endpoint is between G (inclusive)
   and RN (inclusive).

Gopal, Krishnamurthi, Sengodan                               [Page   4]

Internet Draft        Issues in IPSec Context Transfer        Nov  2001

   (4) Type 4 SA: Each endpoint of such an SA lies between PR
   (inclusive) and G (exclusive). When the FP changes from PFP to NFP,
   then both endpoints of such SAs change.
   (5) Type 5 SA: One endpoint of such an SA is at MN, while the other
   lies between PR (inclusive) and G (exclusive). When the FP changes
   from PFP to NFP, then one endpoint of such SAs change.

   Along any data FP, control FP or management FP, there may be zero,
   one or more SAs of any given SA type. While the SAs discussed here
   are with respect to the PFP, it may be noted that an SA type may
   only
   be known after the NFP is determined and any SGs along this NFP are
   discovered. A reason for this is that "G" is not known until the NFP
   is known.

5.2 Illustrating SA types

   The notation used in the illustrations below is as follows. S1
   represents one endpoint of the SA, while S2 represents the other. It
   is immaterial if the SA itself is directed from S1 towards S2, or
   vice versa. When an endpoint of the SA (either S1 or S2) may not be
   collocated within a certain entity (i.e., exclusive case) then this
   is indicated by lines with "%". For example, in Figure 4, since S1
   or S1' may not be collocated with G, two sides of the box have a "%"

   Type 1 SA: As illustrated in Figure 2, the two endpoints of the
   SA (S1 and S2) lie between G (inclusive) and RN (inclusive).
   Action: No security context needs to be transferred for such SAs
   during context transfer.

      +--------+

               Figure 2: Type 1 SA between S1 and S2


   Type 2 SA: As illustrated in Figure 3, S1 is collocated with MN,
   while S2 lies between G (inclusive) and RN (inclusive).
   Action: No security context needs to be transferred for such SAs
   during context transfer.

5.3 Grouping SA types: Multi-lateral and Multi-level SAs

   The five SA types may be grouped in a variety of fashions within the
   actual topology. These are illustrated below:

      o   SAs may be grouped in a multi-lateral fashion, such that one
      or more of the same or different types of SAs are present in a
      sequential fashion. Figure 7 illustrates this scenario, where S1-
      S2 represents one SA, while Sa-Sb represents another.

                Figure 7: Illustrating multi-lateral SAs



      o  SAs may be grouped in a multi-level fashion, such that one or
      more of the same or different types of SAs are stacked one upon
      the other. Figure 8 illustrates this scenario, where S1-S2
      represents one SA, while Sa-Sb represents another.

5.4 Some Specific Scenarios

   Some typical scenarios where security context needs to be
   transferred
   are now discussed.

5.4.1 MN-PR control FP SA

   Figure 9 illustrates the case where a control SA that exists between
   MN-PR is replaced by a control SA that exists between MN-NR.

6. Context Transfer Requirements


6.1 Entities involved in context transfer

   It was seen that no security context needs to be moved for Type 1 or
   Type 2 SAs, but security context may need to be moved for Type 3, 4
   or 5 SAs. Irrespective of the type of SA (Type 3, 4 or 5) whose
   context needs to be transferred or the number of such SAs for which
   context needs to be transferred, the context is always transferred
   from the PR to the NR. This has the following implications:

      o All IPSec security context for any SA in the PFP may need to be
      made available to the PR.

      o After the IPSec security context for one or more SAs in the PFP
      has been transferred from PR to NR, a mechanism is needed to move
      these contexts to the appropriate SA endpoint in the NFP.

   As an illustration of this approach, consider a Type 4 SA in Figure
   5, where context at S1 needs to be moved to S1', and context at S2
   needs to be moved to S2'. In this case, the contexts at S1 and S2
   are
   made available at PR, which then transfers them to NR, and NR
   subsequently moves these contexts to S1' and S2' respectively.

   For the case where the security context already exists at PR and
   where the new location of the security context is NR (for instance,
   the case of Section 4.4.1), no context needs to be moved either from
   a different entity to PR along PFP or from NR to a different entity
   along NFP.


6.2 Discovery of SGs along FP

   Along any FP (PFP or NFP), the SGs have to be discovered and the SAs
   that need to be established have to be identified. When the FP
   changes from PFP to NFP, there exists two possibilities:

      o One or more security contexts associated with SAs along the
      PFP,
      may be transferred from PR to NR "prior" to discovering either
      the
      NFP and/or SGs along the NFP.

      o One or more security contexts associated with SAs along the
      PFP,
      are transferred from PR to NR "only after" the NFP is known and
      the SGs along the NFP have been discovered.

   There are trade-offs to each of these two approaches. In the former
   case, the knowledge of the PFP, SGs and their associated security
   context along the PFP at the NR may help in establishing the NFP.
   The
   NFP, of course, would still have to be in conformance with the
   user's
   static profile. In the latter case, knowing the NFP, the NR may
   selectively request security context transfer (or may even not have
   to request any security context transfer) from PR.

   Such discovery of SGs along any FP is not within the scope of this
   document.


6.3 IPv4 and IPv6 address support

   This requirement fits within the framework of general context
   transfer requirements. Context transfer should be possible
   irrespective of whether one or both ARs have either an IPv4 or an
   IPv6 address.


6.4 Private Addressing support

   This requirement fits within the framework of general context
   transfer requirements. Context transfer should be possible
   irrespective of whether one or both ARs have a private IPv4 address.
   One mechanism that may be used to handle the case of private
   addresses is as described in [9].

7. IPSec Security Context

   The IPSec feature context itself is comprised of several components:

      o Part or whole of the static profile associated with the 'user'.
      o Selector fields of an SA
      o SPI value
      o The static attributes of an SA
      o The dynamic attributes of an SA
      o Replay window parameters

   Each of these is discussed in greater detail below.

7.1 User's static profile

   Security requirements pertaining to a user are stored within the
   user's static profile. Among other things, such a profile may
   specify
   the range of security mechanisms, security algorithms, key lengths
   etc. that may be used for security associations pertaining to the
   user. The various options provided in the profile may also be in a
   certain preferred order, so that a certain option is only chosen if

Internet Draft        Issues in IPSec Context Transfer        Nov  2001

   an option of higher preference is not available. For instance, a
   decreasing order of preference for encryption algorithms could be
   "AES, 3-DES, DES", implying that 3-DES is to be used only if AES is
   cannot be used, and that DES is to be used only if both AES and 3-
   DES
   cannot be used. Similarly, a decreasing order of preference for key
   lengths used within AES could be "256, 192, 128", implying that a
   192-bit key is to be used only when a 256-bit key cannot be used,
   and
   that a 128-bit key is to be used only when both 256-bit and 192-bit
   keys cannot be used.

   The reason that the user's static profile may have to be known at
   the
   NR is that along the NFP, it may be possible to use a certain option
   in the static profile that has a higher preference than which is
   used
   within an SA along the PFP. For instance, if we consider a Type 5 SA
   (as shown in Figure 6), it may be possible that 3-DES is used
   between
   S1-S2 because S2 does not support AES, but that S2' supports AES. In
   this case, although not always, it may be desirable to support the
   more preferred option along the NFP. If the user's static profile is
   not sent, then the NR would not have this choice.

7.2 Selector fields of an SA

   Selector fields are used to determine which packets are provided the
   services of a particular SA. While some selector fields are always
   sent, others are optional. Selectors that are always sent are the
   source IP address and the destination IP address. Optional selectors
   are the source port, destination port, TOS byte etc.

7.3 SPI value

   The SPI value is sent so that it could be reused at the endpoint of
   the SA along the NFP.

7.4 Static attributes of an SA

   Static attributes of an SA refer to those attributes that are
   instantiated at the time of SA establishment, and which do not
   change
   with time. Examples of such attributes include:

      o Authentication/encryption algorithm
      o Key length
      o Block size
      o Algorithm mode

7.5 Dynamic attributes of an SA

   Dynamic attributes of an SA refer to those attributes that change
   with time. Examples of such attributes include:

      o SA duration (in terms of seconds or bytes transmitted) before
      key refresh

7.6 Replay window parameters

   A receiver of an IPSec SA may decide to activate anti-replay
   protection. Parameters relevant to anti-replay protection are:

      o window size
      o highest sequence number of an authenticated packet
      o indication of whether packets within window have been
      successfully received or not

   When the IPSec security context is transparently sent from PR to NR,
   the replay window parameters are also sent. Using these parameters,
   the entity that receives this security context from the NR in the
   NFP, may transparently start providing anti-replay protection.


8. Security Considerations

   The IPSec security feature context that is to be transferred from AR
   to PR involves several security considerations:

      o Discovery of SGs along a forwarding path needs to be done in a
      secure fashion.
      o Transmission of security context from an endpoint of an SA to
      the PR needs to be done in a secure fashion.
      o Transmission of security context from PR to NR needs to be
      secure.
      o Transmission of security context from NR to the endpoint of the
      SA along the NFP needs to be secure.
