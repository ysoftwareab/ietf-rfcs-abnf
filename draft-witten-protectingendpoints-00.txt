1.  Introduction

   A classic model of security emphasizes only "communications security"
   between two "secure endpoints," with emphasis on both the need to
   secure the endpoints, and the need to protect the communications
   between those endpoints.  Modern cryptographic protocols help protect
   the communications.  However, most endpoints still have
   vulnerabilities.  These vulnerabilities often have serious
   consequences, including host compromise, and violation of any
   confidentiality, integrity, and availability properties desired for
   the information on the host and to which the host has access.  Of
   course, resultant consequences can be far worse for many parties
   including consumers, activists, dissidents, commercial companies,
   banks, utilities, and critical infrastructure of nearly all manner,
   as well as anyone who depends on them.  In this context, mitigation
   of endpoint vulnerabilities is very important.

   Mitigation of endpoint vulnerabilities is often achieved via
   different means.  For instance, security conscious and security
   knowledgeable users and administrators often lock down endpoints with
   strong operational security techniques.  Alternatively, many users
   and administrators with less security expertise often depend on third
   party products to help protect their endpoints.  Sometimes these
   endpoint protection solutions install directly onto or into the
   endpoint to be protected.  However, sometimes the manufacturer of an
   endpoint has produced a "closed" endpoint into which enough security
   cannot be installed, or cannot be installed by anyone other than the
   manufacturer who has already failed to install enough security.  In
   such cases, it's often possible to configure the endpoint and network
   to ensure that all traffic to the endpoint is routed through a
   security gateway attempting to protect the endpoint.  This is often
   done through either constraining the physical network topology, or by

   trunking all of an endpoint's traffic through a Virtual Private
   Network (VPN) which effectively connects the endpoint to the security
   gateway.  Note that with the rise of increasingly closed operating
   systems for mobile and "Internet of Things" (IoT) devices, this model
   of routing traffic through a security gateway is growing since such
   vulnerable closed devices can only get additional security from the
   network if not from the manufacturer who already failed to build in
   adequate security.

2.  Relevant Data

2.1.  Number of Certificates Issued to Phishing Sites

   In August of 2017, broadly trusted Certificate Authorities (CA)
   including most commonly "Let's Encrypt," issued more than 4,800 TLS
   certificates to phishing sites.  Over the past year, these same CA's
   issued more than 25,000 TLS certificates to phishing sites.  We offer
   below a conservative month by month count of TLS certificates issued
   to phishing sites.

                        +----------------+-------+
                        | Month          | Count |
                        +----------------+-------+
                        | August 2017    | 4,800 |
                        | July 2017      | 4,000 |
                        | June 2017      | 2,900 |
                        | May 2017       | 3,600 |
                        | April 2017     | 3,200 |
                        | March 2017     | 2,600 |
                        | February 2017  | 2,400 |
                        | January 2017   | 2,200 |
                        | December 2016  | 1,600 |
                        | November 2016  | 1,100 |
                        | October 2016   | 500   |
                        | September 2016 | 200   |
                        | August 2016    | 200   |
                        | July 2016      | 90    |
                        | June 2016      | 80    |
                        | May 2016       | 60    |
                        | April 2016     | 60    |
                        | March 2016     | 40    |

    Table 1: Conservative Counts of TLS Certificates Issued to Phishing
                                   Sites

   We note 20x year-over-year growth in issuance of TLS certificates to
   phishing sites by trusted CA.  We also note that phishing links are
   distributed through many means including not only email but also
   malicious web advertising often referred to as "malvertising," along
   with other means such as SMS and instant messaging.  We also note
   that the numbers above do not include the vast number of legitimate
   websites which are then later compromised and used for phishing along
   with other types of attacks.

2.2.  Attack Rates, first data provider

   On a sampling of 90 million endpoints, in a given week of November
   2017, 4 million of those endpoints were attacked.  Of those 4 million
   machines attacked in that week, more than 1 million were protected by
   Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) inspecting network traffic.  The
   other 3 million were protected by other technologies.

2.3.  Attack Rates, second data provider

   A second source contributed data to this report.  From that source,
   for the month of October, 17.5 million users received 13 million
   attempts at infection through malware, and 2 million attempts at
   phishing.  We also note that while some malware attempts are
   malicious attachments, others are links to files which then
   downloaded over FTP, HTTP, or HTTPS.

   If the data is extrapolated, the data from both providers implies (a)
   attack rates of more than 100 million attacks per year, and (b) each
   endpoint would be compromised multiple times per year if not for the
   third party security technologies protecting these endpoints, or some
   other protection, such as tight operational security of the endpoints
   on a level which is beyond the abilities of the average person.  Of
   course, every person, including consumers, deserve the right to
   protect themselves and to choose the technologies and technology
   providers they prefer to protect them.

2.4.  Portion of Attack Traffic Already Hiding in HTTPS

   A third source contributed data to this report.  From that source, in
   three days of January of 2017, over a million file download requests
   were requests for malware.  Of that million, more than 60,000 were
   "second stage" requests.  For this source, for that three-day period,
   out of 1,396 of the most dangerous files, only 137 (9.8%) were from
   HTTPS URLs.

   That same source also sampled a period in November of 2017.  From
   that source, in three days of November of 2017, over 974,000 file
   download requests were requests for malware.  117,000 of these

Internet-Draft       Network Protection of Endpoints       December 2017


   requests (roughly 12%) were confirmed as HTTPS or confirmed as TLS or
   SSL.  An additional 26% of those requests (total of 38% = 26% + 12%)
   served files over port 443, but it was unclear whether the protocol
   was HTTPS or something else.

2.5.  Additional Observations

   The data above in sections 2.2 and 2.3 does not include attacks
   leveraging weaknesses in browser security models such as pop-under
   mining of crypto-currency without the user's awareness [Tung], or
   remote code exploitation vulnerabilities such as [rapid7] and
   [Cimpanu], or CVE-2012-1845, CVE-2012-2897, CVE-2012-5112, CVE-
   2012-5142, CVE-2016-1962, CVE-2016-1935, or over a dozen other high
   severity remote code execution vulnerabilities found in browsers over
   the past ten years.  Of course, this is no criticism of browsers
   specifically.  All code has vulnerabilities.  Concern stems from
   those vulnerabilities being embedded in a "first line of defense"
   running on the user's devices where mistakes can be quite damaging to
   the device and the device's user.  Instead, the reality that all code
   has vulnerabilities should more strongly help drive urgency of
   creating lines of defense in the network where exploitation of
   vulnerabilities on disposable virtual machines can be far less
   devastating than exploitation in the endpoint for an end user and
   information on their device.

3.  Conclusion

   Precluding network based protection for endpoints is not consistent
   with the imperative to treat mass surveillance as an attack.  Mass
   hacking of endpoints is surveillance by another means.

   Endpoints currently face risks of compromise at a rate of a million
   endpoints per week.  Network based mitigation of endpoint
   vulnerabilities is increasingly important to protecting those
   endpoints.

   Exposing millions of users per year to phishing, malvertising, and
   countless other attacks, and denying them network based protection
   against those attacks seems inconsistent with stated goals and
   objectives of the IETF.  Failing to standardize safer ways to provide
   endpoints such network based protection against endpoint
   vulnerabilities similarly seems to fall short of stated IETF goals
   and objectives.
