Internet-Draft        Unicode Consortium Procedures        February 2002


1. About The Unicode Consortium

   The Unicode Consortium is a corporation.  Legally speaking it is a
   "California Nonprofit Mutual Benefit Corporation", organized under
   section 501 C(6) of the Internal Revenue Service Code.  [see http://
   www.irs.ustreas.gov/prod/bus_info/eo/bus-orgs.html].  As such, it is
   a "business league" not focussed on profiting by sales or production
   of goods and services, but neither is it formally a "charitable"
   organization.  It is an alliance of member companies whose purpose is
   to "extend, maintain, and promote the Unicode Standard".  To this
   end, the consortium keeps a small office, a few editorial and
   technical staff, World Wide Web presence, and mail-list presence.

   The corporation is presided over by a Board of Directors who meet
   annually.  The board appoints Officers of the corporation to run the
   daily operations.

   Membership in the consortium is open to "all corporations, other
   business entities, governmental agencies, not-for-profit
   organizations and academic institutions" who support the consortium's
   purpose.  Formally, one class of voting membership is recognized, and
   dues-paying members are typically for-profit corporations, research
   and educational institutions, or national governments.  Each such
   full member sends representatives to meetings of the Unicode
   Technical Committee (see below), as well as to a brief annual
   Membership meeting.

2. The Unicode Technical Committee

   The Unicode Technical Committee (UTC) is the technical decision
   making body of the consortium.  The UTC inherited the work and prior
   decisions of the Unicode Working Group (UWG) that was active prior to
   formation of the consortium.

   Formally, the UTC is a technical body instituted by resolution of the
   board of directors.  Each member appoints one principal and one or
   two alternate representatives to the UTC.  UTC representatives
   frequently do, but need not, act as the ordinary member
   representatives for the purposes of the annual meeting.

   The UTC is presided over by a Chair and Vice-Chair, appointed by the
   Board of Directors for an unspecified term of service.

   The UTC meets 4 to 5 times a year to discuss proposals, additions,
   and various other technical topics.  There is no fee for
   participation in the UTC meetings.  Meeting agendas are not generally
   posted to any public forum, but meeting dates, locations, and
   logistics are posted well in advance at:

      http://www.unicode.org/unicode/timesens/calendar.html

   At the discretion of the UTC chair, meetings are open to
   participation of member and liaison organizations, and to observation
   by others.  The minutes of meetings are posted publicly on the
   Unicode Web site:

      http://www.unicode.org/unicode/consortium/utc-minutes.html

   Meetings of the UTC are held in North America, frequently in the San
   Francisco Bay Area, where the majority of full members have offices.
   Meetings typically last 3 to 4 full days.  Rarely, a portion of a
   meeting will be declared a "closed caucus" for member
   representatives.

   All UTC meetings are held jointly with NCITS Technical Committee L2,
   the body responsible for Character Code standards in the United
   States.  They constitute "ad hoc" meetings of the L2 body.

3. Unicode Technical Committee Procedures

   The formal procedures of the UTC are publicly available in a document
   entitled "UTC Procedures" available from the Consortium, and on the
   website:

      http://www.unicode.org/unicode/consortium/utc-procedures.html

   Despite the invocation of Robert's Rules of Order, UTC meetings are
   conducted with relative informality in view of the highly technical
   nature of most discussions.  Meetings focus on items from a technical
   agenda organized and published by the UTC Chair prior to the meeting.
   Technical items are usually proposals in one of the following
   categories:

   1.  Addition of new scripts

   2.  Addition of new characters or small batches of characters

   3.  Preparation and Editing of Technical Reports and Standards

   4.  Changes in the semantics of specific characters

   5.  Changes to the encoding architecture and forms of use

   (Note: The last category of changes are, of course, rare and not
   undertaken without significant lead time and involvement of
   organizations, such as W3C and IETF, having standards that are likely
   to be affected by such changes and with which the UTC maintains
   liaisons.  Changes that affect existing normalizations in particular
   are normally disallowed according to UTC procedures, so that W3C and
   IETF standards which rely on them are not thereby broken.  See
   section 5 below.)

   Typical outputs of the UTC are:

   1.  The Unicode Standard, major and minor versions

   2.  Unicode Technical Reports

   3.  Stand-alone Unicode Technical Standards

   4.  Formal resolutions

   5.  Liaison statements and instructions to the Unicode liaisons to
       other organizations.

   For each technical item on the meeting agenda, there is a general

   process as follows:

   1.  Introduction by the topic sponsor

   2.  Proposals and discussion

   3.  Consensus statements or formal motions

4. Unicode Technical Committee Motions

   Technical topics of any complexity never proceed from initial
   proposal to final ratification or adoption into the standard in the
   course of one UTC meeting.  The UTC members and presiding officers
   are aware that technical changes to the standard have broad
   consequences to other standards, implementors, and end-users of the
   standard.  Input from other organizations and experts is often vital
   to the understanding of various proposals and for successful adoption
   into the standard.

   Technical topics are decided in UTC through the use of formal
   motions, either taken in meetings, or by means of 30-day letter
   ballots.  Formal UTC motions are of two types:

   1.  Simple motions

   2.  Precedents

   Simple motions may pass with a simple majority constituting more than
   50% of the qualified voting members; or by a special majority
   constituting 2/3 or more of the qualified voting members.

   Precedents are defined, according to the UTC Procedures as either

      (A) an existing Unicode Policy, or

      (B) an explicit precedent.

   Prececents must be passed or overturned by a special majority.

   Examples of implicit precedents include:

   1.  Publication of a character in the standard

   2.  Published normative character properties

   3.  Algorithms required for formal conformance

   An Explicit Precedent is a policy, procedure, encoding, algorithm, or
   other item that is established by a separate motion saying (in
   effect) that a particular prior motion establishes a precedent.

5. Unicode Consortium Policies

   Because the Unicode Standard is continually evolving to approach the
   ideal of encoding "all the world's scripts", new characters will
   constantly be added.  In this sense, the standard is unstable: in the
   standard's useful lifetime, there may never be a final point at which
   no more characters are added.  Realizing this, the Consortium has
   adopted certain policies to promote and maintain stability of the
   characters that are already encoded, as well as laying out a Roadmap
   to future encodings.

   The overall policies of the Consortium with regard to encoding
   stability are published on the web at this URL:

      http://www.unicode.org/unicode/standard/policies.html

   Deliberations and encoding proposals in the UTC are bound by these
   policies.

   The general effect of the policies may be stated in this way: once a
   character is encoded, it will not be moved or removed and its name
   will not be changed.  Any of those actions has the potential for
   causing obsolescence of data, and they are not permitted.  The
   canonical combining class and decompositions of characters will not
   be changed in any way that affects normalization.  In this sense
   normalization, such as that used for International Domain Naming and
   "early normalization" for use on the World Wide Web, is fixed and
   stable for every character at the time that character is encoded.

   Property values of characters, such as directionality for the Unicode
   Bidi algorithm, may be changed in some circumstances.  As less-well
   documented characters and scripts are encoded, the exact character
   properties and behavior may not be well known at the time the
   characters are first encoded.  As more experience is gathered in
   implementing the newly encoded characters, adjustments in the
   properties may become necessary.  This re-working is kept to a
   minimum.  New and old versions of the relevant property tables are
   made available on the Consortium's web site.

   Normative and some informative data about characters is kept in the
   Unicode Character Database.  The structure of many of these property
   values will not be changed.  Instead, when new properties are
   defined, the Consortium adds new files for these properties, so as
   not to affect the stability of existing implementations that use the
   values and properties defined in the existing formats and files.

Internet-Draft        Unicode Consortium Procedures        February 2002


6. UTC and ISO (WG2 and WG20)

   The character repertoire, names, and general architecture of the
   Unicode Standard are identical to the parallel international standard
   ISO/IEC 10646.  Unicode provides additional properties and
   implementation information that ISO/IEC 10646 does not.
   Implementations conformant to Unicode are conformant to ISO/IEC
   10646.

   ISO/IEC 10646 is maintained by the committee ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2/WG2,
   which maintains a web presence at: http://www.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/.

   The WG2 committee is composed of national body representatives to
   ISO.  Details of ISO organization may be found at http://www.iso.ch.

   Details and history of the relationship between ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2/WG2
   and Unicode, Inc.  may be found in Appendix C of The Unicode
   Standard.

   WG2 shares with UTC the policies regarding stability: WG2 neither
   removes characters nor changes their names once published.  Changes
   in both standards are closely tracked by the respective committees,
   and a very close working relationship is fostered to maintain
   synchronization between the standards.

   The Unicode Collation Algorithm (UCA) is one of a small set of other
   independent standards defined and maintained by UTC.  It is not,
   properly speaking, part of the Unicode Standard itself, but is
   separately defined in Unicode Technical Standard #10 (UTS #10).
   There is no conformance relationship between the two standards,
   except that conformance to a specific base version of the Unicode
   Standard (e.g., 3.0) is specified in a particular version of a UTS.
   The collation algorithm specified in UTS #10 is intended to remain in
   conformance to ISO/IEC 14651 maintained by ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2/WG20, and
   the two organizations maintain a close relationship.

7. Process of Technical Changes to the Unicode Standard

   Changes to The Unicode Standard are of two types: architectural
   changes, and character additions.

   Some architectural changes may not affect ISO/IEC 10646, for example,
   the addition of some informative properties to Unicode.  Those
   architectural changes that do affect both standards, such as
   additional UTF formats or allocation of planes, are very carefully
   coordinated by the committees.  As always, on the UTC side,
   architectural changes that establish precedents are carefully
   monitored and the above-described rules and procedures are followed.

   Additional characters for inclusion in the The Unicode Standard must
   be approved both by the UTC and by WG2.  Proposals for additional
   characters enter the standards process in one of several ways:
   through...

   1.  a national body member of WG2

   2.  a member company or associate of UTC

   3.  directly from an individual "expert" contributor

   The two committees have jointly produced a "Proposal Summary Form"
   that is required to accompany all additional character proposals.  It
   may be found online at:

      http://www.dkuug.dk/JTC1/SC2/WG2/docs/form1.html

   Instructions for submitting proposals to UTC may be found online at:

      http://www.unicode.org/pending/proposals.html

   Often, submission of proposals to both committees (UTC and WG2) is
   simultaneous.  Members of UTC also frequently forward to WG2
   proposals that have been initially reviewed by UTC.

   In general, a proposal that is submitted to UTC before being
   submitted to WG2 passes through several stages:

   1.  Initial presentation to UTC

   2.  Review and re-drafting

   3.  Forwarding to WG2 for consideration

   4.  Re-drafting for technical changes

Internet-Draft        Unicode Consortium Procedures        February 2002


   5.  Balloting for approval in UTC

   6.  Re-forwading and recommendation to WG2

   7.  At least two rounds of international balloting in ISO

   About two years are required to complete this process.  Proposals of
   any type are almost never directly approved by UTC on first viewing,
   but are usually sent back to the submitters.  Repertoire addition
   proposals that are submitted to WG2 before Unicode are generally
   forwarded immediately to UTC through committee liaisons.  The crucial
   parts of the process (steps 5 through 7 above) are never short-
   circuited.  Two-thirds majority in UTC is required for approval at
   step 5.

   Proposals for additional scripts are required to be coordinated with
   relevant user communities.  Often there are ad-hoc subcommittees of
   UTC or expert mail list participants who are responsible for actually
   drafting proposals, garnering community support, or representing user
   communities.

   The rounds of international balloting (steps 7) have participation
   both by UTC and WG2, though UTC does not directly vote in the ISO
   process.

   Occasionally a proposal approved by one body is considered too
   immature for approval by the other body, and may be blocked de-facto
   by either of the two.  Only after both bodies have approved the
   additional characters do they proceed to the rounds of international
   balloting.  (The first round is a draft international standard during
   which some changes may occur, the second round is final approval
   during which only editorial changes are made.)

   This process assures that proposals for additional characters are
   mature and stable by the time they appear in a final international
   ballot.

8. Public Access to the Character Encoding Process

   While Unicode, Inc, is a membership organization, and the final say
   in technical matters rests with UTC, the process is quite open to
   public input and scrutiny of processes and proposals.  There are many
   influential individual experts and industry groups who are not
   formally members, but whose input to the process is taken seriously
   by UTC.

   Internally, UTC maintains a mail list called the "Unicore" list,
   which carries traffic related to meetings, technical content of the
   standard, and so forth.  Members of the list are UTC representatives;
   employees and staff of member organizations (such as the Research
   Libraries Group); individual liaisons to and from other standards
   bodies (such as WG2 and IETF); and invited experts from institutions
   such as the Library of Congress and some universities.  Subscription
   to the list for external individuals is subject to "sponsorship" by
   the corporate officers.

   Unicode, Inc.  also maintains a public discussion list called the
   "Unicode" list.  Subscription is open to anyone, and proceedings of
   the "Unicode" mail list are made public via FTP on an occasional
   basis.  Details are located at:

      http://www.unicode.org/unicode/consortium/distlist.html

   All technical proposals for changes to the standard are posted to
   both of these mail lists on a regular basis.  Discussion on the
   public list is also monitored by many members of UTC, and frequently
   the results of these public discussions are brought up later at UTC
   meetings.  All technical issues and other standardization "events" of
   any significance, such as beta releases and availablility of draft
   documents, are announced and then discussed in this public forum,
   well before standardization is finalized.

   Anyone may make a character encoding or architectural proposal to
   UTC.  Membership in the organization is not required to submit a
   proposal.  To be taken seriously, the proposal must be framed in a
   substantial way, and be accompanied by sufficient documentation to
   warrant discussion.  Examples of proposals are easily available by
   following links from the "Proposed Characters" heading available at
   the Unicode web site.  The main proposal page is at:

      http://www.unicode.org/unicode/alloc/Pipeline.html

   (Guidelines for proposals are given at the web location mentioned in
   the previous section.)

Internet-Draft        Unicode Consortium Procedures        February 2002


   In general, proposals are aired on the "Unicode" mail list, sometimes
   for a long period, prior to formal submission.  Generally this is of
   benefit to the proposer as it tends to reduce the number of times the
   proposal is sent back for clarification or with requests for
   additional information.  Once a proposal reaches the stage of being
   ready for discussion by UTC, the proposer will have received contact
   through the public mail list with one or more UTC members willing to
   explain or defend it in a UTC meeting.
