  <h1 id="rfc.abstract"><a href="#rfc.abstract">Abstract</a></h1>
<p>RTP has always been a protocol that supports multiple participants each sending their own media streams in an RTP session. Unfortunately many implementations aimed only at point to point voice over IP with a single source in each end-point. Even client implementations aimed at video conferences have often been built with the assumption around central mixers that only deliver a single media stream per media type.  Thus any application that wants to allow for more advance usage where multiple media streams are sent and received by an end-point has a problem with legacy. This issue is analyzed, and RTP clarifications and signalling extensions are proposed to handle this issue. A related issue is how to perform simulcast, in the meaning of sending multiple encodings or representations of the same media source, when using RTP for media transport. This is further analyzed and possible solutions discussed and we arrive at a conclusion for session multiplexing of simulcast versions. We also found a number of related issues when having multiple streams and simulcast.</p>

  <h1 id="rfc.section.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.1">1.</a> Introduction</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">This document looks at the issues of non basic usage of RTP where there is multiple media sources sent over an RTP session. This include multiple sources from the same end-point, multiple end-points each having a source, or due to an application that needs multiple encodings of a particular source. As will be shown these issues are interrelated and need a common discussion to ensure consistency.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">After presenting the usages and the found issues the document goes on to discuss ways of solving the issues. These include both clarifications to the basic RTP behaviors and signalling extensions to be able to setup these session, also in the presence of legacy systems that are not assumed to have full support for multiple media streams within an RTP session.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.3">This document proposes several general mechanisms that could be used independently in other use cases. We foresee that those proposals would in the end become independent but related documents in the relevant WGs of AVTCORE, AVTEXT and MMUSIC. However, at this stage when all these ideas are introduced we find it more useful to keep them together to ensure consistency and to make any relations clear, hopefully making it easier to find and resolve any issues in the area of multiple streams and simulcast.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.1.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.1.1">1.1.</a> Multiple Streams </h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.1">RTP sessions are a concept which most fundamental part is a SSRC space. This space can encompass a number of network nodes and interconnect transport flows between these nodes. Each node may have zero, one or more source identifiers (SSRCs) used to either identify a real media source such as a camera or a microphone, a conceptual source, like the most active speaker selected by a RTP mixer that switches between incoming media streams based on the media stream or additional information, or simply as an identifier for a receiver that provides feedback and reports on reception. There are also RTP nodes, like translators that are manipulating, data, transport or session state without making their presence aware to the other session participants.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.2">RTP was designed with multiple participants in a session from the beginning. This was not restricted to multicast as many believe but also unicast using either multiple transport flows below RTP or a network node that redistributes the RTP packets, either unchanged in the form of a transport translator (relay) or modified in an RTP mixer. In addition a single end-point may have multiple media sources of the same media type, like cameras or microphones.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.3">However, the most common use cases has been point to point Voice over IP (VoIP) or streaming applications where there has commonly not been more than one media source per end-point. Even in conferencing applications, especially voice only, the conference focus or bridge has provided a single stream being a mix of the other participants to each participant. Thus there has been perceived little need for handling multiple SSRCs in implementations. This has resulted in an installed legacy base that isn't fully RTP specification compliant and will have different issues if they receive multiple SSRCs of media, either simultaneously or in sequence. These issues will manifest themselves in various ways, either by software crashes, or simply in limited functionality, like only decoding and playing back the first or latest SSRC received and discarding any other SSRCs.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.4">The signalling solutions around RTP, especially SDP based, hasn't considered the fundamental issues around RTP session's theoretical support of up to 4 billion plus sources all sending media. No end-point has infinite processing resources to decode and mix any number of sources with media. In addition the memory for storing related state, especially decoder state is limited, and the network bandwidth to receive multiple streams is also limited. Today, the most likely limitations are processing and network bandwidth, although for some use cases memory or other limitations may exist. The point is that a given end-point will have some limitations in the number of streams it simultaneously can receive, decode and playback. These limitations needs to be possible to expose and enabling the session participants to take them into account.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.5">In similar ways there is a need for an end-point to express if it intends to produce one or more media stream. Todays SDP signalling support for this is basically the directionality attribute which indicates an end-point intend to send media or not. No indication of how many media streams.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.6">Taking these things together there exist a clear need to enable the usage of multiple simultaneous media streams within an RTP session in a way that allows a system to take legacy implementations into account in addition to negotiate the actual capabilities around the multiple streams in an RTP session.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.7">In addition to address the above set of issues we will also identify a number of issues related to multiple streams that should be addressed in the most suitable way. These include both obscurities in the RTP specification and short-comings in various signalling mechanisms that are exposed by multi-stream use cases.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.1.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.1.2">1.2.</a> Simulcast</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.1">Simulcast is the act of simultaneously sending multiple different versions of a media content. This can be done in several ways and for different purposes. This document focuses on the case where one wants to provide multiple different encodings towards a intermediary so that the intermediary can select which version to forward to other participants in the session. More discussion on the different ways of doing simulcast, which is the focus of this document in <a href="#sec-applicability">"Simulcast Usage and Applicability"</a> <cite title="NONE">[sec-applicability]</cite>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.2">The different versions of a source content that can be simulcasted and that are considered in this document are:</p>
<p></p>

<dl>
<dt>Bit-rate:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">The primary difference is the amount of bits spent to encode the source and thus primarily affects the media signal to noise ratio (SNR).</dd>
<dt>Codec:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">Different media codecs are used to ensure that different receivers that do not have a common set of decoders can decode at least one of the versions. This includes codec configuration options that aren't compatible, like video encoder profiles, or the capability of receiving the transport packetization.</dd>
<dt>Sampling:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">Different sampling of media, in spatial as well as in temporal domain, may be used to suit different rendering capabilities or needs at receiving endpoints, as well as a method to achieve different bit-rates. For video streams, spatial sampling affects image resolution, and temporal sampling affects video framerate. For audio, spatial sampling relates to the number of audio channels, and temporal sampling affects audio bandwidth.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Different applications will have different reasons for providing a single media source in different versions. And as soon as an application have need for multiple versions for some reason, a potential need for simulcast is created. This need can arise even in media codecs that have scalability features built in to solve a set of variations.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.4">The purpose of this document is to find the most suitable solution for the non-trivial variants of simulcast. To determine this, an analysis of different ways of multiplexing the different encodings are discussed in <a href="#sec-alternatives">Section 6</a>. Following the presentation of the alternatives, an analysis is performed in <a href="#sec-eval">Section 7</a> on how different aspects like RTP mechanisms, signaling possibilities, and network features are affected by the alternatives.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.5">The document ends with a recommendation for which solution is the most suitable and indicates what standardization work should be done if the WG agrees on the analysis and the suitability to define how simulcast should be done.</p>

<h1 id="rfc.section.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.3">3.</a> <a href="#sec-applicability" id="sec-applicability">Simulcast Usage and Applicability</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.1">This section discusses different usage scenarios the term simulcast may refer to, and makes it clear which of those this document focuses on. It also reviews why simulcast and scalable codecs can be a useful combination.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.3.1">3.1.</a> <a href="#sec-sim-mixer" id="sec-sim-mixer">Simulcasting to RTP Mixer</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.1">The usage here is in a multi-party session where one uses one or more central nodes to help facilitate the media transport between the session participants. Thus, this targets the RTP topology defined in <a href="#RFC5117">[RFC5117]</a> of RTP Mixer (Section 3.4: Topo-Mixer).  This usage is one which is targeted for further discussion in this document.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.2">Simulcasting different media encodings of video that has both different resolution and bit-rate is highly applicable to video conferencing scenarios. For example an RTP mixer selects the most active speaker and sends that participant's media stream as a high resolution stream to a receiver and in addition provides a number of small resolution video streams of any additional participants, thus enabling the receiving user to both see the current speaker in high quality and monitor the other participants. The active speaker gets a different combination of streams as it has limited use to get back the streams itself is sending. Thus, there can be several different combinations of high resolution and low resolution video in use simultaneously; requiring both a high and low resolution video from some sources at the same time.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.3">For example, to provide both high and low resolution from an RTP Mixer there exist these potential alternatives:</p>
<p></p>

<dl>
<dt>Simulcast:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">The client sends one stream for the low resolution and another for the high resolution.</dd>
<dt>Scalable Video Coding:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">Using a video encoder that can provide one media stream that is both providing the high resolution and enables the mixer to extract a low resolution representation that has lower bit-rate than the full stream version.</dd>
<dt>Transcoding in the Mixer:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">The client transmits a high resolution stream to the RTP Mixer, which performs a transcoding to a lower resolution version of the video stream that is forwarded to the ones that need it.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The Transcoding requires that the mixer has sufficient amounts of transcoding resources to produce the number of low resolution versions required. This may in worst case be that all participants' streams needs transcoding. If the resources are not available, a different solution needs to be chosen.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.5">The scalable video encoding requires a more complex encoder compared to non-scalable encoding. Also, if the resolution difference is big, the scalable codec may in fact be only marginally more bandwidth efficient, between the encoding client and the mixer, than a simulcast that sends the resolutions in separate streams, assuming equivalent video quality. At the same time, with scalable video encoding, the transmission of all but the lowest resolution will definitely consume more bandwidth from the mixer to the other participants than a non-scalable encoding, again assuming equivalent video quality.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.6">Simulcasting has the benefit that it is conceptually simple. It enables use of any media codec that the participants agree on, allowing the mixer to be codec-agnostic. Considering today's video encoders, it is less bit-rate efficient in the path from the sending client to the mixer but more efficient in the mixer to receiver path compared to Scalable Video Coding.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3.1.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.3.1.1">3.1.1.</a> Simulcast Combined with Scalable Encoding</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.1.p.1">Scalable codecs are often used in arguments to motivate why simulcast isn't needed. A single media encoding that is sent as one joint media stream or divided up in base layers and enhancement layers over multiple transport is sufficient to achieve the desired functionality. As explained above in reality scalable codec is often not more efficient, especially in the path from the mixer to the receiver.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.1.p.2">There are however, good reasons to combine simulcast with scalable encoding. By using simulcast to cover encoding variations where the scalable codec least efficient one can optimize the efficiency of the complete system. So a low number of simulcast working points, where each working point is in its turn a scalable codec configuration providing medium and/or fine grained scalability allowing a mixer to further tune the bit-rate to the available towards particular receivers using a combination of selecting simulcast versions and the number of extensions layers from that source.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.1.p.3">A good example of this usage would be to send video encoded using SVC, where each simulcast version is a different resolution, and each SVC media stream uses temporal scalability and SNR scalability within that single media stream. If only resolution and temporal variations are needed, this can be implemented using H.264, as each simulcast version provides the different resolution, and each media stream within a simulcast encoding has temporal scalability using no-reference frames.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.3.2">3.2.</a> Simulcasting to Consuming End-Point</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.1">This usage is based on an <a href="#RFC5117">RTP Transport Translator (Section 3.3: Topo-Trn-Translator)</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC5117]</cite>. The transport translator functions as a relay and transmits all the streams received from one participant to all the other participants. In this case, one would do downlink simulcasting such that all receivers would receive all the versions. However, this clearly increases the bit-rate consumed on the paths to the client. The only benefit for the receiving client would be reduced decoding complexity when needing to only display a low resolution version. Otherwise a single stream application which only transmits the high resolution stream would allow the receiver to decode it and scale it down to the needed resolution.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.2">The usage of transport translator and simulcast becomes efficient if one allows each receiving client to control the relay to indicate which version it wants to receive. However such a usage of RTP has some potential issues with RTCP. From the sending end-point it will look like the transmitted stream isn't received by a receiver that is known to receive other streams from the sender. Thus some consideration and mechanism are needed to support such a use case so that it doesn't break RTCP reception reporting.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.3">This document will continue to consider this case but with less emphasis than on the RTP mixer case.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.3.3">3.3.</a> Same Encoding to Multiple Destinations</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.1">One interpretation of simulcast is when one encoding is sent to multiple receivers. This is well supported in RTP by simply copying all outgoing RTP and RTCP traffic to several transport destinations as long as the intention is to create a common RTP session. As long as all participants do the same, a full mesh is constructed and everyone in the multi party session has a similar view of the joint RTP session. This is analog to an Any Source Multicast (ASM) session but without the traffic optimization as multiple copies of the same content is likely to have to pass over the same link.</p>

</pre>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.2">As this type of simulcast is analog to ASM usage and RTP has good support for ASM sessions, no further consideration for this case is done.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3.4">
<a href="#rfc.section.3.4">3.4.</a> Different Encoding to Independent Destinations</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.4.p.1">Another alternative interpretation of simulcast is with multiple destinations, where each destination gets a specifically tailored version, but where the destinations are independent. A typical example for this would be a streaming server distributing the same live session to a number of receivers, adapting the quality and resolution of the multi-media session to each receiver's capability and available bit-rate. This case can be solved in RTP by having independent RTP sessions between the sender and the receivers. Thus this case is not considered further.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4">
<a href="#rfc.section.4">4.</a> Multiple Streams Issues</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.1">This section attempts to go a bit more in depth around the different issues when using multiple media streams in an RTP session to make it clear that although in theory multi-stream applications should already be possible to use, there are good reasons to create extensions for signalling. In addition, the RTP specification could benefit from clarifications on how certain mechanisms should be working when an RTP session contains more than two SSRCs.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.1">4.1.</a> Legacy behaviors</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.1">It is a common assumption among many applications using RTP that they don't have a need to support more than one incoming and one outgoing media stream per RTP session. For a number of applications this assumption has been correct. For VoIP and Streaming applications it has been easiest to ensure that a given end-point only receives and/or sends a single stream. However, they should support a source switching SSRC, e.g due to collision.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.2">Some RTP extension mechanisms require the RTP stacks to handle additional SSRCs, like SSRC multiplexed <a href="#RFC4588">RTP retransmission</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC4588]</cite>. However, that still has only required handling a single media decoding chain.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.3">However, there are applications that clearly can benefit from receiving and using multiple media streams simultaneously. A very basic case would be T.140 conversational text, which is both low bandwidth and where there is no simple method for mixing multiple sources of text that is supposed to be transmitted and displayed as you type. An RTP session that contains more than 2 SSRC actively sending media streams has the potential to confuse a legacy client in various ways:</p>
<p></p>

<ol>
<li>The receiving client needs to handle receiving more than one stream simultaneously rather than replacing the already existing stream with the new one.</li>
<li>Be capable of decoding multiple streams simultaneously</li>
<li>Be capable of rendering multiple streams simultaneously</li>
</ol>

<p>These applications may be very similar to existing one media stream applications at signalling level. To avoid connecting two different implementations, one that is built to support multiple streams and one that isn't, it is important that the capabilities are signalled. It is also the legacy that makes us use a basic assumption in the solution. Anyone that doesn't explicitly indicate capability to receive multiple media streams is assumed to only handle a single media, to avoid affecting legacy clients.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.2">4.2.</a> Receiver Limitations</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.1">An RTP end-point that intends to process the media in an RTP session needs to have sufficient resources to receive and process all the incoming streams. It is extremely likely that no receiver is capable to handle the theoretical upper limit of an RTP session when it comes to more than 4 billion media sources. Instead, one or more properties will limit the end-points' capabilities to handle simultaneous media streams. These properties are for example memory, processing, network bandwidth, memory bandwidth, or rendering estate to mention a few possible limitations.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.2">We have also considered the issue of how many simultaneous non-active sources an end-point can handle. We cannot see that inactive media sending SSRCs result in significant resource consumption and there should thus be no need to limit them.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.3">A potential issue that needs to be acknowledged is where a limited set of simultaneously active sources varies within a larger set of session members. As each media decoding chain may contain state, it is important that this type of usage ensures that a receiver can flush a decoding state for an inactive source and if that source becomes active again it does not assume that this previous state exists.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.4">Thus, we see need for a signalling solution that allows a receiver to indicate its upper limit in terms of capability to handle simultaneous media streams. We see little need for an upper limitation of RTP session members. Applications will need to have some considerations around how they use codecs.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.3">4.3.</a> Transmission Declarations</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.1">In an RTP based system where an end-point may either be legacy or has an explicit upper limit in the number of simultaneous streams, one will encounter situations where the end-point will not receive all simultaneous active streams in the session. Instead the end-points or central nodes, like RTP mixers, will provide the end-point with a selected set of streams based on various metrics, such as most active, most interesting, or user selected. In addition, the central node may combine multiple media streams using mixing or composition into a new media stream to enable an end-point to get a sufficient source coverage in the session, despite existing limitations.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.4.p.1">This section details a few RTP and RTCP issues identified in implementation work for supporting multiple streams.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.4.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.4.1">4.4.1.</a> Multiple Sender Reports in Compound</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.4.1.p.1">One potential interoperability issue is inclusion of multiple Sender Report blocks in the same RTCP compound packet. The RTP specification isn't clear if such stacking is allowed or not. Thus there might be RTCP receivers that might not correctly handle such message. There is also an uncertainty how one should calculate the RTCP transmission intervals in such cases.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.4.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.4.2">4.4.2.</a> Cross reporting within an end-point</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.4.2.p.1">When an end-point has more than one SSRC and sends media using them, a question arises if the different SSRCs needs to report on each other despite being local. It can be argued that it is needed due to that it might not be fully visible for any external observer that they are actually sent from the same end-point. Thus by reporting on each other there are no holes in the connectivity matrix between all sending SSRCs and all known SSRCs.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.4.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.4.3">4.4.3.</a> Which SSRC is providing feedback</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.4.3.p.1">When one has multiple SSRCs on an end-point and needs to send RTCP feedback messages some considerations around which SSRC is used as the source and if that is consistently used or not, may be needed.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.5">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.5">4.5.</a> SDP Signalling Issues</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.5.p.1">An existing issue with SDP is that the bandwidth parameters aren't specified to take asymmetric conditions into account. This becomes especially evident when we start using multiple streams in an RTP session. Such a use case can easily result in that an end-point maybe receive 5 streams of Full High Definition (HD) video but only sends one Standard Definition (SD) video stream. Thus easily having a 10:1 asymmetry in bit-rate.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.5.p.2">If one uses the current SDP bandwidth parameters then one likely needs to set the session bandwidth to the sum of the most consuming direction. This can result in that there is no way of negotiating an upper bound for the lower band-width direction media stream(s). In addition, an end-point may conclude that it can't support the bit-rate despite being capable of actually receiving the media streams being sent. Thus making clear what bandwidth limitations a single stream has compared to the whole RTP session is important.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.5.p.3">In the cases there is QoS, either by end-point reservation or done by systems like IMS, the requested bandwidth based on the signalled value will not represent what is actually needed.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.5.p.4">Asymmetry in itself also create an issue, as RTCP bandwidth may be derived from the session bandwidth. It is important that all end-points have a common view on what the RTCP bandwidth is. Otherwise if the bandwidth values are more than 5 times different, an end-point with the high bandwidth value may time out an end-point that has a low value as it's minimal reporting interval can become more than 5 times longer than for the other nodes.</p>

The number of RTP streams that can be sent from a client should not have to match the number of streams that can be received by the same client. A multi-stream capable RTP sender MUST be able to adapt the number of sent streams to the RTP receiver capability.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.2">For this purpose and for use in SDP, two new media-level SDP attributes are defined, max-send-ssrc and max-recv-ssrc, which can be used independently to establish a limit to the number of simultaneously active SSRCs for the send and receive directions, respectively.

There MUST be at most one payload-agnostic limit specified in each direction.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.5">A payload-specific upper limit to the total number of simultaneous SSRC in the RTP session with that specific payload type is signaled with a defined payload type (static, or dynamic through rtpmap).

CNAME is not sufficient to express this relation although it is commonly inferred from end-points that has only one media stream per media type. CNAME primary use in multi-source usages is to indicate which end-point and what synchronization context a particular media stream relates to.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.3.p.2">To enable a RTP session participant to determine that close binding across multiple sessions, despite the end-point sending multiple SSRCs a new method for identifying such sources are needed.

Thus we propose one defines a new SDES item called the SRCNAME which identifies with an unique identifier a single multi-media source, like a camera and a co-located microphone, or a truly individual media source such as a camera. That way any one receiving the SDES information from a set of interlinked RTP sessions can determine which are the same source.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.5.3.1.p.3">This SRCNAME's relation to CNAME is the following. CNAME represents an end-point and a synchronization context. If the different sources identified by SRCNAMEs should be played out synchronized when receiving them in a multi-stream context, then the sources need to be in the same synchronization context.

<p id="rfc.section.6.1.p.1">Payload multiplexing uses only the RTP payload type to identify the different alternatives. Thus all alternative streams would be sent in the same RTP session using only a single SSRC per actual media source.  So when having multiple SSRCs, each SSRC would be unique media sources or RTP mechanism-related SSRC. Each RTP payload type would then need to both indicate the particular encoding and its configuration in addition to being a stream identifier. When considering a mechanism like RTP retransmission using SSRC multiplexing, an SSRC may either be a media source with multiple encodings as provided by the payload type, or a retransmission packet as identified also by the payload type.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.1.p.2">As some encoders, like video, produce large payloads one can not expect that multiple payload encodings can fit in the same RTP packet payload.

The identification of how flows are considered to be alternative needs an additional mechanism, for example using <a href="#RFC5576">SSRC grouping</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC5576]</cite> and a new SDES item such as SRCNAME proposed in <a href="#sdes-srcname">Section 5.3.1</a> with a semantics that indicate them as alternatives of a particular media source. When one have multiple actual media sources in a session, each media source will use a number of SSRCs to represent the different alternatives it produces. For example, if all actual media sources are similar and produce the same number of simulcast versions, one will have n*m SSRCs in use in the RTP session, where n is the number of actual media sources and m the number of simulcast versions they can produce. Each SSRC can use any of the configured payload types for this RTP session. All session level attributes and parameters which are not source specific will apply and must function with all the alternative encodings intended to be used.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.6.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.6.3">6.3.</a> Session Multiplexing</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.6.3.p.1">Session multiplexing means that each different version of an actual media source is transmitted in a different RTP session, using whatever session identifier to de-multiplex the different versions. This solution needs explicit <a href="#RFC5888">session grouping</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC5888]</cite> with a semantics that indicate them as alternatives. When there are multiple actual media sources in use, the SSRC representing a particular source will be present in the sessions for which it produces a simulcast version. It is also important to identify the SSRCs in the different sessions that are alternative encodings to each other, this can be accomplished using the same SSRC and/or a new SDES item identifying the media source across the session as the proposed <a href="#sdes-srcname">SRCNAME SDES item</a> <cite title="NONE">[sdes-srcname]</cite>. Each RTP session will have its own set of configured RTP payload types where each SSRC in that session can use any of the configured ones.

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.1">This chapter evaluates the different multiplexing strategies in regard to several aspects.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.7.1">7.1.</a> Effects on RTP/RTCP</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.p.1">This section will be oriented around the different multiplexing mechanisms.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7.1.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.7.1.1">7.1.1.</a> <a href="#sec-pt-rtp" id="sec-pt-rtp">Payload Type Multiplexing</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.1.p.1">The simulcast solution needs to ensure that the negative impact on RTP/RTCP is minimal and that all the features of RTP/RTCP and its extensions can be used.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.1.p.2">Payload type multiplexing for purposes like simulcast has well known negative effects on RTP. The basic issue is that all the different versions are being sent on the same SSRC, thus using the same timestamp and sequence number space. This has many effects:</p>
<p></p>

<ol>
<li>Putting restraint between media encoding versions. For example, media encodings that uses different RTP timestamp rates cannot be combined as the timestamp values needs to be the same across all versions of the same media frame. Thus they are forced to use the same rate. When this is not possible, Payload Type Multiplexing cannot be used.</li>
<li>Most RTP payload formats that may fragment a media object over multiple packets, like parts of a video frame, needs to determine the order of the fragments to correctly decode them.  Thus it is important that one ensure that all fragments related to a frame or a similar media object are transmitted in sequence and without interruptions within the object. This can relatively simple be solved by ensuring that each version is sent in sequence.</li>
<li>Some media formats require uninterrupted sequence number space between media parts. These are media formats where any missing RTP sequence number will result in decoding failure or invoking of a repair mechanism within a single media context.  The <a href="#RFC4103">text/T140 payload format</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC4103]</cite> is an example of such a format. These formats will be impossible to simulcast using payload multiplexing.</li>
<li>Sending multiple versions in the same sequence number space makes it more difficult to determine which version a packet loss may relate to. If one uses <a href="#RFC4588">RTP Retransmission</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC4588]</cite> one can ask for the missing packet.  However, if the missing packet(s) do not belong to the version one is interested in, the retransmission request was in fact unnecessary.</li>
<li>The current RTCP feedback mechanisms are built around providing feedback on media streams based on stream ID (SSRC), packet (sequence numbers) and time interval (RTP Timestamps).  There is almost never a field for indicating which payload type one is reporting on. Thus giving version specific feedback is difficult.</li>
<li>The current <a href="#RFC5104">RTCP media control messages</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC5104]</cite> specification is oriented around controlling particular media flows, i.e. requests are done addressing a particular SSRC. Thus such mechanisms needs to be redefined to support payload type multiplexing.</li>
<li>The number of payload types are inherently limited.  Accordingly, using payload type multiplexing limits the number of simulcast streams and does not scale.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7.1.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.7.1.2">7.1.2.</a> SSRC Multiplexing</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.2.p.1">As each version of the source has its own SSRC and thus explicitly unique flows, the <a href="#sec-pt-rtp">negative effects above</a> <cite title="NONE">[sec-pt-rtp]</cite> are not present for SSRC multiplexed simulcast.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.2.p.2">The SSRC multiplexing of simulcast version requires a receiver to know that one is expected to only decode one of the versions and need not decode all of them simultaneously. This is currently a missing functionality as SDES CNAME cannot be used. The same CNAME has to be used for all flows connected to the same end-point and location. A clear example of this could be video conference where an end-point has 3 video cameras plus an audio mix being captured in the same room. As the media has a common timeline, it is important to be able to indicate that through the CNAME. Thus one cannot use CNAME to indicate that multiple SSRCs with the same CNAME are different versions of the same source. New semantics are required.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.2.p.3">When one has all the versions in the same RTP session going to an RTP mixer and the mixer chooses to switch from forwarding one of the versions to forwarding another version, this creates an uncertainty in which SSRC one should use in the CSRC field (if used). As one is still delivering the same original source, such switch appears questionable to a receiver not having enabled simulcast in the direction to itself. Depending on what solution one chooses, one gets different effects here. If the CSRC is changed, then any message ensuring binding will need to be forwarded by the mixer, creating legacy issues. It has not been determined if there are downsides to not showing such a switch.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.2.p.4">The impact of SSRC collisions on the SSRC multiplexing will be highly depending on what method is used to bind the SSRCs that provide different versions. Upon a collision and a forced change of the SSRC, a media sender will need to re-establish the binding to the other versions. By doing that, it will also likely be explicit when it comes to what the change was.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7.1.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.7.1.3">7.1.3.</a> Session Multiplexing</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.3.p.1">Also session multiplexing does not have any of the negative effects that <a href="#sec-pt-rtp">payload type multiplexing has</a> <cite title="NONE">[sec-pt-rtp]</cite>. As each flow is uniquely identified by RTP Session and SSRC, one can control and report on each flow explicitly. The great advantage of this method is that each RTP session appears just like if simulcast is not used thus minimal issues in RTP and RTCP including any extensions.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.3.p.2">One potential downside of session multiplexing is that it becomes impossible without defining new RTCP message types to do truly synchronized media requests where one request goes to version A of source and another to version B of the same source. Due to the RTP session separation, one will be forced to send different RTCP packets to the different RTP session contexts, thus losing the ability to send two different RTCP packets in the same compound packet and RTP session context. This can be a minor inconvenience.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.3.p.3">Using the same SSRC in all the RTP sessions allows for quick binding between the different versions. It also enables an RTP mixer that forwards one version to seamlessly decide to forward another version in a RTP session to a session participant that is not using simulcast in the direction from the mixer to the participant.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.3.p.4">An SSRC collision forces a sender to change its SSRC in all sessions. Thus the collision-induced SSRC change may have bigger impact, as it affects all versions rather than a single version. But on the positive side, the binding between the versions will be immediate, rather than requiring additional signaling.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.7.2">7.2.</a> Signaling Impact</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.p.1">The method of multiplexing has significant impact on signaling functionality and how to perform it, especially if <a href="#RFC4566">SDP</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC4566]</cite> and <a href="#RFC3264">SDP Offer/Answer</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC3264]</cite> is used.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7.2.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.7.2.1">7.2.1.</a> Negotiating the use of Simulcast</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.1.p.1">There will be a need for negotiating the usage of simulcast in general. For payload type multiplexing, one will need to indicate that different RTP payload types are intended as different simulcast versions. One likely has standalone SDP attributes that indicate the relation between the payload types, as one needs unique payload type numbers for the different versions. Thus, this increases the number of payload types needed within an RTP session. In worst case this may become a restriction as only 128 payload types are possible.  This limitation is exacerbated if one uses solutions like <a href="#RFC5761">RTP and RTCP multiplexing</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC5761]</cite> where a number of payload types are blocked due to the overlap between RTP and RTCP.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.1.p.2">SSRC multiplexing will likely use a standalone attribute to indicate the usage of simulcast. In addition, it may be possible to use a mechanism in SDP that binds the different SSRCs together. The first part is non-controversial. However the second one has significant impact on the signaling load in sessions with dynamic session participation. As each new participant joins a multiparty session, the existing participants that need to know the binding will need to receive an updated list of bindings. If that is done in SIP and SDP offer answer, a SIP re-Invite is required for each such transaction, invoking all the SIP nodes related to invites, and in systems like IMS also a number of policy nodes. If a receiver is required, which is likely, to receive the SSRC bindings prior to being able to decode any new source, then the signaling channel may introduce additional delay before a receiver can decode the media.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.1.p.3">Session multiplexing results in one media description per version. It will be necessary to indicate which RTP sessions are in fact simulcast versions. For example, using a Media grouping semantics specific for this. Each of these sessions will be focused on the particular version they intend to transport.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.1.p.4">Legacy fallback, the impact on an end-point that isn't simulcast enabled, also needs to be considered. For a payload type multiplex solution, a legacy end-point that doesn't understand the indication that different RTP payload types are for different purpose may be slightly confused by the large amount of possibly overlapping or identical RTP payload types. In addition, as payload multiplexing isn't backwards compatible within a single media stream, the signalling needs to ensure that such a legacy client doesn't join a session using simulcast.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.1.p.5">For an SSRC multiplexed session, a legacy end-point will ignore the SSRC binding signaling. From its perspective, this session will look like an ordinary session and it will setup to handle all the versions simultaneously. Thus, a legacy client is capable of decoding and rendering a simulcast enabled RTP session, but it will consume more resources and result in a duplication of the same source.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.1.p.6">For session multiplexing, a legacy end-point will not understand the grouping semantic. It might either understand the grouping framework and thus determine that they are grouped for some purpose, or not understand grouping at all and then the offer simply looks like several different media sessions. This enables a simple fallback solution to exclude a legacy client from all simulcast versions except one, whichever is most suitable for the application.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7.2.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.7.2.2">7.2.2.</a> Bandwidth negotation</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.2.p.1">The payload type multiplexed session cannot negotiate bandwidth for the individual versions without extensions. The regular SDP bandwidth attributes can only negotiate the overall bandwidth that all versions will consume. This makes it difficult to determine that one should drop one or more versions due to lack of bandwidth between the peers.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.2.p.2">SSRC multiplexing suffers the same issues as payload type multiplexing, unless additional signaling (SSRC level attributes) is added.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.2.p.3">Session multiplexing can negotiate bandwidth for each individual version and determine to exclude a particular version, and have the full knowledge on what it excludes to avoid consuming an excessive amount of bandwidth.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7.2.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.7.2.3">7.2.3.</a> Negotation of media parameters</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.3.p.1">The negotiation and setting of the media codec, the codec parameters and RTP payload parameters for the payload type multiplexing is possible for each individual version as each has a unique payload type. The same is true for the session multiplexing where each version negotiates the parameters in the context of it's RTP session. The SSRC multiplexed version would need additional signaling to enable a binding between the payload types and which versions they are used for. Otherwise, the RTP payload types are negotiated without any context of which version intends to use which payload type.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.3.p.2">However, the above assumes that there are no issues with defining different payload types for different alternative encodings. If that is not possible or it is intended to use the same payload type for multiple encodings, then additional signalling becomes necessary which isn't possible for payload multiplexing. For SSRC multiplexing, this signalling needs to redefine already existing session attributes, like <a href="#RFC6236">imageattr</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC6236]</cite> to have a per-SSRC scope. Session multiplexing can use existing attributes as they automatically get per-encoding scope thanks to the session multiplexing.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7.2.4">
<a href="#rfc.section.7.2.4">7.2.4.</a> Negotation of RTP/RTCP Extensions</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.4.p.1">When one negotiates or configures the existing RTP and RTCP extensions, that can be done on either session level or in direct relation to one or several RTP payload types. They are not negotiated in the context of an SSRC. Thus payload type multiplexing will need to negotiate any session level extensions for all the versions without version specific consideration, unless extensions are deployed. It can also negotiate payload specific versions at a version individual level. SSRC multiplexing cannot negotiate any extension related to a certain version without extensions. Session multiplexing will have the full freedom of negotiating extensions for each version individually without any additional extensions.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.7.3">7.3.</a> Network Aspects</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.3.p.1">The multiplexing choice has impact on network level mechanisms.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7.3.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.7.3.1">7.3.1.</a> Quality of Service</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.3.1.p.1">When it comes to Quality of Service mechanisms, they are either flow based or marking based. <a href="#RFC2205">RSVP</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC2205]</cite> is an example of a flow based mechanism, while <a href="#RFC2474">Diff-Serv</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC2474]</cite> is an example of a Marking based one. If one uses a marking based scheme, the method of multiplexing will not affect the possibility to use QoS. However, if one uses a flow based one, there is a clear difference between the methods.  Both Payload Type and SSRC multiplexing will result in all versions being part of the same 5-tuple (protocol, source address, destination address, source port, destination port) which is the most common selector for flow based QoS. Thus, separation of the level of QoS between versions is not possible. That is however possible if one uses session based multiplexing, where each different version will be in a different RTP context and thus commonly being sent over different 5-tuples.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7.3.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.7.3.2">7.3.2.</a> NAT Traversal</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.3.2.p.1">Both the payload and SSRC multiplexing will have only one RTP session, not introducing any additional NAT traversal complexities compared to not using simulcast and only have a single version. The session multiplexing is using one RTP session per simulcast version.  Thus additional lower layer transport flows will be required unless an explicit de-multiplexing layer is added between RTP and the transport protocol.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.3.2.p.2">Below we analyzed and comment on the impact of requiring more underlying transport flows in the presence of NATs and Firewalls:</p>
<p></p>

<dl>
<dt>End-Point Port Consumption:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">A given IP address only has 65536 available local ports per transport protocol for any consumer of ports that exist on the machine. This is normally never an issue for a end-user machine. It can become an issue for servers that have large number of simultaneous flows.  However, if the application uses ICE, which authenticated STUN requests, a server can serve multiple end-point from the same local port, and use the whole 5-tuple (source and destination address, source and destination port, protocol) as identifier of flows after having securely bound them to end-points using the STUN request. Thus in theory the minimal number of media server ports needed are the maximum number of simultaneous RTP sessions a single end-point may use, when in practice implementation will probably benefit from using more.</dd>
<dt>NAT State:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">If an end-point is behind a NAT each flow it generates to an external address will result in a state on that NAT. That state is a limited resource, either from memory or processing stand-point in home or SOHO NATs, or for large scale NATs serving many internal end-points, the available external ports run-out. We see this primarily as a problem for larger centralized NATs where end-point independent mapping do require each flow mapping to use one port for the external IP address. Thus affecting the maximum aggregation of internal users per external IP address. However, we would like to point out that a real-time video conference session with audio and video are likely using less than 10 UDP flows, it is not like certain web applications that can result that 100+ TCP flows are opened to various servers from a single browser instance.</dd>
<dt>NAT Traversal taking additional time:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">When doing the NAT/FW traversal it takes additional time. And it takes time in a phase of communication between accepting to communicate and the media path being established which is fairly critical. The best case scenario for how much extra time it can take following the specified ICE procedures are: 1.5*RTT + Ta*(Additional_Flows-1), where Ta is the pacing timer, which ICE specifies to be no smaller than 20 ms. That assumes a message in one direction, and then an immediate triggered check back. This as ICE first finds one candidate pair that works prior to establish multiple flows. Thus, there are no extra time until one has found a working candidate pair. Based on that working pair the extra time it takes, is what it takes to in parallel establish the additional flows which in most case are 2-3 additional flows.</dd>
<dt>NAT Traversal Failure Rate:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">Due to that one need more than a single flow to be established through the NAT there is some risk that one succeed in establishing the first flow but fails with one or more of the additional flows. The risk that this happens are hard to quantify. However, that risk should be fairly low as one has just prior successfully established one flow from the same interfaces. Thus only rare events as NAT resource overload, or selecting particular port numbers that are filtered etc, should be reasons for failure.</dd>
</dl>
<p id="rfc.section.7.3.2.p.4">As most simulcast solutions will anyway not use a very large number of simulcast versions due to the cost in encoding resources etc. one can discuss if the extra transport flows are a significant cost. We perceive the cost as low, if others are concluding that the cost is higher, a more generalized mechanism for multiplexing RTP sessions onto the same underlying transport flow should be considered.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7.4">
<a href="#rfc.section.7.4">7.4.</a> Summary</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.4.p.1">It is quite clear from the analysis that payload type multiplexing is not at all a realistic option for using simulcast. It has many issues, especially on RTP/RTCP level. Thus, we will not consider it a viable solution in further discussions below.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.4.p.2">Both SSRC and session multiplexing are viable to use. However, session multiplexing provides increased flexibility in usage, better support for network QoS, signalling flexibility, and support compared to SSRC multiplexing, without defining additional extensions. Session multiplexing does however require additional NAT/FW pinholes to be opened or some other solution to allow multiple RTP sessions to share the same transport flow, but that is anyway something that already happens in today's applications.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.4.p.3">The authors consider the impact on the signalling one of the most significant issues when it comes to SSRC multiplexing. For many use cases, selecting SSRC multiplexing will require us to define numerous signalling mechanisms to support binding such properties to specific SSRCs or encoding groups. This signalling already exists today for non simulcast RTP sessions or for simulcast in a session multiplexing context.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.4.p.4">Session multiplexing is in the authors view clearly the best choice and is therefore recommended to be pursued as the single solution for simulcast.</p>

<a href="#rfc.section.8">8.</a> Simulcast Extensions</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.1">This section discusses various extensions that either are required or could provide system performance gains if they where specified.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.8.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.8.1">8.1.</a> Signalling Support for Simulcast</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.8.1.p.1">To enable the usage of simulcast using session multiplexing some minimal signalling support is required. That support is discussed in this section. First of all, there is need for a mechanism to identify the RTP sessions carrying simulcast alternatives to each other.  Secondly, a receiver needs to be able to identify the SSRC in the different sessions that are of the same media source but in different encodings.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.1.p.2">Beyond the necessary signalling support for simulcast we look at some very useful optimizations in regards to the transmission of media streams and to help RTP mixers to select which stream alternatives to deliver to a specific client, or request a client to encode in a particular way.</p>

<a href="#rfc.section.8.1.1">8.1.1.</a> <a href="#simulcast-group" id="simulcast-group">Grouping Simulcast RTP Sessions</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.8.1.1.p.1">The proposal is to define a new grouping semantics for the <a href="#RFC5888">session groupings framework</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC5888]</cite>. There is a need to separate the semantics of intent to send simulcast streams from the capability to recognize and receive them. For that reason two new simulcast grouping tags are defined, "SimulCast Receive" (SCR) and "SimulCast Send" (SCS). They both act as an indicator that session level simulcast is occurring and which sets of RTP sessions that carries simulcast alternatives to each other.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.1.1.p.2">The grouping semantics SCR and SCS SHOULD be combined with the SDP attributes "a=max-send-ssrc" and "a=max-recv-ssrc" <a href="#multi-stream">Section 5.1</a> to indicate the number of simultaneous streams of each encoding that may be sent or capable of receiving.</p>

SCS and SCR MAY be used independently and at the same time and they need not specify the same or even the same number of RTP sessions in the group. The answerer MUST change SCS to SCR and SCR to SCS in the answer, given that it has and wants to use the corresponding (reverse) capability. An answerer not supporting the SCS or SCR direction, or not supporting SCS or SCR grouping semantics at all, will remove that grouping attribute altogether, according to <a href="#RFC5888">[RFC5888]</a>. An offerer that receives an answer indicating lack of simulcast support in one or both directions, where SCR and/or SCS grouping are removed, MUST NOT use simulcast in the non-supported direction(s).</p>

<a href="#rfc.section.8.1.2">8.1.2.</a> Binding SSRCs Across RTP Sessions</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.8.1.2.p.1">When one performs simulcast, a transmitting end-point will for each actual media source have one SSRC in each session for which it currently provides an encoding alternative. As a receiver or a mixer will receive one or more of these, it is important that any RTP session participant beyond the sender can explicitly identify which SSRCs in the set of RTP sessions providing a simulcast service for a particular media type that originate from the same media source and thus belong together in the simulcast.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.1.2.p.2">To accomplish this we extend the usage of SRCNAME as defined in <a href="#sdes-srcname">Section 5.3.1</a>. Within a particular media type the different RTP session carrying the different encodings will have the same SRCNAME identifier. That way even if multiple encodings or representations are produced, any one receiving the SDES information from a set of interlinked RTP sessions can determine which are the same source.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.8.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.8.2">8.2.</a> Mixer Requests of Client streams</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.8.2.p.1">To increase the efficiency of simulcast systems, it is highly desirable that an RTP middlebox can signal to the client encoding and transmitting the streams if a particular stream is currently needed or not. This needs to be a quick and media plane oriented solution as it changes based on for example the user's speech activity or the user's selection in the user interface. Although several SIP and SDP-based methods would be possible, the required responsiveness suggests use of TMMBR from <a href="#RFC5104">[RFC5104]</a> with a bandwidth value of 0 to temporarily pause a certain SSRC and re-establishing transmission through TMMBR with a non-zero value.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.8.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.8.3">8.3.</a> Client to Mixer and Mixer to Client limiations</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.8.3.p.1">When a client has known limitations, for example based on local display layout between sources or if there is a better combination of streams from the available set of different encodings, then it is desirable to make these limitations known to the mixer delivering the streams. These limitations are also clearly dynamic, as sources may come or leave the session, making it prefer a different layout with another set of limitations in the delivered streams.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.3.p.2">The Codec Control Messages in <a href="#RFC5104">[RFC5104]</a> defines some controls. However, with the addition of simulcast and scalable video there are more parameters that would be desired to control in a way similar to the Temporary Maximum Media Stream Bit Rate (TMMBR) messages, beyond just bit-rate. Factors such as largest image dimension and frame rate will also be needed, for example. In the context of simulcast, one also needs to consider if a limitation is not specific to an SSRC, but rather which encoding and scalability variation is most suitable from a particular media source (SRCNAME).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.3.p.3">Thus we propose that new RTCP messages are defined to temporarily limit media source with respect to a combination of media stream properties such as for example bit-rate, frame-rate, image resolution, and audio channels. Such a message should be flexible enough to allow for additional limitation attributes.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.8.4.p.1">It should be considered for RTP in non-legacy cases if multiple RTP sessions could be multiplexed in a standardized way on top of a single transport layer flow. That way the cost of opening additional transport flows and the needed NAT/FW traversal would be avoided. We acknowledge that this has impact on use cases using a flow based QoS mechanism that needs differentiated service levels between sessions.  Such a mechanism should thus be optional to use, but as there is likely a general interest in such a mechanism, work on this should be started.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.8.5.1.1.p.3">Client A (Alice) in above figure is a desktop video conference client with a single camera and microphone. It uses a central transport translator to relay its media streams to the other participants, and in the same way it receives media streams from all other participants from the relay. This enables the client to locally render and present other participants in a layout selected by the local client.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.5.1.1.p.4">The network path between client A and the translator has certain known limitations, leading to a client needing to express its upper bounds in simultaneous streams that can be supported.

The audio session has 4 payload types being configured and the different payload configurations also show Alice's intentions of their different bandwidth usage. For the audio receive direction, Alice accepts an aggregate bandwidth of 1288 kbps with a 1500 byte bucket depth. This is sufficient bandwidth for 10 simultaneous streams. This limit of up to 10 streams being received is additionally indicated on SSRC level using the a=max-recv-ssrc attribute.

The first video media line also acts as the single receive video (making media line sendrecv), while the second video media line is only related to simulcast transmission and is thus offered sendonly.

<p id="rfc.section.8.5.2.2.p.2">Bob has a three-camera, three-screen, simulcast-enabled client with even higher performance than Alice's and can additionally support 720p video, as well as multiple receive streams of various resolutions. The client implementor has thus decided to offer three simulcast streams for each camera, indicated by the SCS grouping tag and the three media ID's (2, 3, and 4) in the SDP.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.5.2.2.p.3">The first video media line with media ID 2 indicates the ability to send video from three simultaneous video sources (cameras) through the max-send-ssrc attribute with value 3. This media line is also marked as the main video by using the content attribute from <a href="#RFC4796">[RFC4796]</a>. Also the receive direction has declared ability to handle multiple video sources, and in this example it is 2. The interpretation of content:main for those two streams in the receive direction is that the client expects and can present (in prime position) at most two main (active speaker) video streams from another multi-camera client.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.5.2.2.p.4">The second and third video media lines with media ID 3 and 4 are the sendonly simulcast streams. They can implicitly through the grouping be interpreted as also being content:main for the send direction, but is not marked as such since multiple media blocks with content:main could be confusing for a legacy client.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.5.2.2.p.5">The fourth video media line with media ID 5 is recvonly and is marked with content:alt. That media line should, as was intended for that content attribute value, receive alternative content to the main speaker, such as "audience". In a multi-party conference, that could for example be the next-to-most-active speakers. The SDP describes that those streams can be presented in a set of different resolutions, indicated through the different payload types. The maximum number of streams per payload type is indicated through the max-recv-ssrc attribute. In this example, at most one stream can have payload type 96, preferably 720p, as indicated by the related imageattr line. Similarly, at most 4 streams can have payload type 97, preferably using 360p resolution, and at most 16 streams can have payload type 98, preferably of 180p resolution.  In any case, there must never be more than 16 simultaneous streams of any payload type, but combinations of payload types may occur, such as for example two streams using payload type 97 and 8 streams using payload type 98.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.5.2.2.p.6">To be able to relate the three cameras with the three microphones, all media lines that send audio or video use the ssrc attribute from <a href="#RFC5576">[RFC5576]</a>, specifying the same SRCNAME from <a href="#srcname-grouping">Section 5.3.2</a> for the audio and video versions that belong together. The use of this attribute is optional and the information can be retrieved from RTCP reporting, but it will then not be possible to correctly relate audio and video sources until the first RTCP report is received and participants may then seemingly make uncorrelated moves between screens and/or speakers when adjusting possible false correlation assumptions.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.5.2.2.p.7">The legacy bandwidth reflects only the bandwidth in the receive direction, while the new bw attribute is very specific per direction and per media stream. We do note that the offered bandwidth for transmission express as AS on session level woad be 6985. It is unclear what is the correct interpretation of the legacy bandwidth when there is bandwidth asymmetry.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.5.2.2.p.8">The answer from a simulcast-enabled RTP mixer to this last SDP could look like:</p>

<p id="rfc.section.8.5.2.2.p.9">In this SDP answer, the grouping tag is changed to SCR, confirming that the sent simulcast streams will be received. The directionality of the streams themselves as well as the directionality of multi-stream and bandwidth attributes are changed. Note that the session level legacy bandwidth can be calculated more correctly with support from the bw attribute in the offer than would have been the case if only legacy media level bandwidth was present. Bandwidth bucket size can be adjusted down between the offer and the answer for streams sent from the answerer, indicating a more strict constant bitrate than really needed. The bucket size can be adjusted up or down for streams received by the answerer, indicating a more strict or flexible bitrate constraint, respectively, for the receiver compared to what the sender offered. The number of allowed streams in the content:alt video session has been reduced to 8 in the answer from 16 offered.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.5.2.2.p.10">Note that the two video sources in the media block with mid:2 correspond to the two first audio sources (matching SRCNAME). The last audio source correspond to all video sources in the media block with mid:5, however SRCNAME can not be used to perform this binding as its semantic doesn't match.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.8.5.2.4.p.4">Since the RTP mixer support all of the features that Joe does and more, the SDP does not differ much from what it should have been in an offer. It can be noted that as stated in <a href="#RFC5888">[RFC5888]</a>, all media lines need mid attributes, even the rejected ones, which is why mid:3 is present even though the mid quality simulcast version is rejected by Joe.</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.1">There is minimal difference in security between the simulcast solutions. Session multiplexing may have some additional overhead in the key-management, but that is minor as most key management schemes can be performed in parallel.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.2">The multi-stream signalling has as other SDP based signalling issues with man in the middles that may modify the SDP as an attack on either the service in general or a particular end-point. This can as usual be resolved by a security mechanism that provides integrity and source authentication between the signalling peers.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.3">The SDES SRCNAME being opaque identifiers could potentially carry additional meanings or function as overt channel. If the SRCNAME would be permanent between sessions, they have the potential for compromising the users privacy as they can be tracked between sessions. See RFC6222 for more discussion.</p>
