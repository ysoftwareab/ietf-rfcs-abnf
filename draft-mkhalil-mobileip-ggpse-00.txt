Abstract

   The Mobile IP Working Group is considering proposals to provide fast
   hand-off capabilities to the Mobile IP protocol. It is important that
   such proposals do not require usage additional bandwidth, such as
   required by frequent mobility agent advertisements. This
   specification allows a mobility agent to provide its coverage area,
   and the location of neighboring cells, allowing the Mobile Node to
   determine when it must initiate a hand-off.

1.0 Introduction

   This draft relates to a method and protocol for determining that a
   mobile node is leaving a service area using location data, such as
   Global Positioning System (GPS) data, rather than receipt of an agent
   advertisement from a foreign agent.

   Mobile nodes that approach the boundaries of a service area, such as
   the mobile node's home area, generally initiate a hard hand-off upon
   receipt of an agent advertisement being periodically broadcast by a
   foreign agent in a neighboring service area, or cell.  The foreign
   agent broadcasts the agent advertisement every 1-2 seconds to inform
   mobile nodes that they are approaching a new service area and that a
   hard hand-off should be initiated. These broadcast messages use
   valuable air interface bandwidth.

   When the mobile node initiates a hard hand-off, one or more data
   packets may be dropped while handing off service from the current
   mobile agent in the current service area to the new foreign agent in
   the new service area.

   Thus, a need exists for a method that can determine when a mobile
   node is approaching the boundaries of a service area to provide for a
   smoother hand-off with less data packet loss and a reduced burden on
   the air interface.


2.0  Generalized GPS Extension

   This section defines the generalized GPS Extension, used by any
   extension that must carry GPS information.

3.0  Operation

   When a mobile node operates within a cell area, it has previously
   been informed of the cell area's coverage by receipt of a Circular
   Coverage Area Extension message as described in section 2.1 or a
   Rectangular Coverage Area Extension message as described in section
   2.2.  The circular (or rectangular) coverage area extension defines
   the boundaries of the cell area.  As the mobile node travels within
   the cell area, it uses periodic location information, such as GPS
   information, to determine when the mobile node is approaching the
   boundary of the cell area.  The mobile node may use any suitable
   method to determine when it is approaching a cell boundary.  In that
   case, the mobile node determines direction, and possibly speed of
   travel, based on two or more prior location informations. The mobile
   node then uses this information to determine if it is approaching a
   boundary.

   After determining that the mobile node is approaching a boundary, the
   mobile node transmits an agent solicitation for receipt by any nearby
   mobile (foreign) agent in a neighboring cell area.  The agent
   solicitation is a request from the mobile node for another mobile
   agent to take control of administering the mobile node's current
   session.  The mobile agent that receives the agent solicitation
   unicasts an agent advertisement to the mobile node that sent the
   agent solicitation.  The unicast agent advertisement may contain a

INTERNET DRAFT                                                 July 2000


   Neighboring Mobile Agent Coordinate Extension message as described in
   section 2.3 and a coverage area extension as described in section 2.1
   or section 2.2.  The neighboring mobile agent coordinate extension
   informs the mobile node of the location of the mobile agent while the
   coverage area extension informs the mobile node of the coverage area
   of the mobile agent that is taking control of administering the
   mobile node's session.  The unicast agent advertisement accepts the
   mobile node's agent solicitation thereby agreeing to take control of
   the mobile node's session.

   Upon receipt of the unicast agent advertisement, the mobile node
   registers with the mobile agent that sent the unicast agent
   advertisement.  At that time, the new mobile agent takes control of
   the mobile node's current session through a hand off from the
   previous mobile agent to the new mobile agent.

   Note that the mobile agent does not periodically transmit agent
   advertisements for receipt by mobile nodes entering the coverage area
   of the mobile agent. Instead, the mobile agent transmits the agent
   advertisement directly to a mobile node in response to receiving an
   agent solicitation from that mobile node thereby reducing the burden
   on the air interface.  Early detection of the need for a hand-off
   using location information provides for a smoother hand-off with
   fewer dropped packets in a mobile packet data network as compared to
   traditional mobile packet data networks using traditional broadcast
   agent advertisement messages to initiate hand-offs.


4.0  Open Issues

   Section 2.3 describes the Neighboring Mobile Agent Coordinate
   Extension, which provides the Mobile with the location of the
   neighboring Mobility Agents. It is not clear at this time that the
   X/Y location provided is sufficient, and a more descriptive cell
   boundary may be required.


5.0  IANA Considerations

   The number for the Generalized GPS Extension is taken from the
   numbering space defined for Mobile IP registration extensions defined
   in RFC 2002 [3]. These should not conflict with any numbers used in
   RFC 2002[3], RFC 2344 [5], RFC 2356 [6], Mobile IP Challenge/Response
   Extensions Draft [7], Mobile IP Network Access Identifier Extensions
   Draft[1], or Mobile IP Based Micro Mobility Management Protocol in
   The Third Generation Wireless Network Draft [8]. The Code values
   specified for errors, listed in section 6, should not conflict with
   any other code values listed in RFC 2002[1], RFC 2344 [5], RFC 2356

   Network Access Identifier Extensions Draft[1], or Mobile IP Based
   Micro Mobility Management Protocol in The Third Generation Wireless
   Network Draft [8].


6.0  Security Considerations

   This specification makes extensive use of Global Positioning System
   (GPS) information to provide the geographical information of network
   entities.  This draft does not introduce any privacy issues, given
   that a user's Mobile Node never issues its GPS information. This
   draft only defines how Foreign Agents advertise their cell
   boundaries, and this information can already be discovered through
   other means.
