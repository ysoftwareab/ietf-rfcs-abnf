<h1><br />Extending the Bundle Protocol with Relative Time and Hops to Live<br />draft-ellard-dtnrg-reltime-htl-00</h1>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p> This draft presents two extensions to the DTN bundle protocol. 
      The first extension is the use of relative time rather than
      absolute time to address situations where the DTN nodes cannot
      achieve loosely synchronized clocks, as required by the current
      DTN bundle protocol.  The second extension is the addition of a
      "hops-to-live" field to the bundle header, which specifies how
      many node-to-node hops each instance of a bundle is permitted to
      make before it expires.  
</p>
<p> These two extensions are separable; either may be used
      independently of the other.  Used together, however, they
      provide a powerful way to constrain resources consumed by the
      handling of a DTN bundle despite the absence of synchronized
      clocks or the presence of incomplete knowledge of the network
      topology (which may lead to the presence of hazards such as
      routing loops).

Problems Establishing a Real-time Clock</h3>

<p> Delay/Disruption-Tolerant Networking (DTN) is an
	architecture and a set of protocols that enable communication
	in environments with intermittent connectivity and long
	delays.  An architecture for disruption tolerant networks
	<a class='info' href='#RFC4838'>[RFC4838]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Cerf, V., Burleigh, S., Hooke, A., Torgerson, L., Durst, R., Scott, K., Fall, K., and H. Weiss, &ldquo;Delay-Tolerant Networking Architecture,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> has been defined.  This architecture
	describes disruption tolerant networks in terms of DTN nodes
	that create, relay, and deliver units of information termed
	bundles.  Each bundle is defined to have a finite lifetime,
	after which it is deemed to be expired.  A full definition of
	the protocol for creating, interpreting, and handling bundles
	by DTN nodes has also been defined <a class='info' href='#RFC5050'>[RFC5050]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Scott, K. and S. Burleigh, &ldquo;Bundle Protocol Specification,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>. 
	
</p>
<p> One issue that has been raised about the bundle protocol is
	that it assumes that every node in the network has access to a
	realtime clock, and all of these realtime clocks are
	synchronized to a reasonable degree (typically within a small
	number of seconds).  This assumption, when it holds, provides
	the convenience that the timing of both future events (i.e.,
	when a bundle should expire because it is no longer needed, or
	no longer relevant) and past events (i.e., when a bundle was
	created or delivered) may be represented using this common,
	absolute frame of reference.  
</p>
<p> Unfortunately, our experiences in deploying disruption
	tolerant networks have shown that the problem of establishing
	a common realtime clock is currently intractable in some
	real-world scenarios.  The reason is usually a combination of
	several factors:  
</p>
<p> </p>
<ul class="text">
<li> DTN nodes may have reliable, inaccurate clocks.  These
	  clocks might not have been initialized to the correct time
	  or may have lost power since their initialization, or may
	  drift significantly over time.  
</li>
<li> The links between the DTN nodes may often be disrupted. 
	  The nodes might not be able to communicate with an accurate
	  time source to find the current time, or to run a time
	  synchronization protocol such as NTP <a class='info' href='#RFC2030'>[RFC2030]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Mills, D., &ldquo;Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP) Version 4 for IPv4, IPv6 and OSI,&rdquo; October&nbsp;1996.</span><span>)</span></a> to negotiate a shared time reference. 
	  
</li>
<li> Bundle lifetimes may be short.  If bundle lifetimes
	  are comparable with the amount of clock drift that can
	  accumulate between good clock settings, bundles may appear
	  to have expired before they are sent.  
</li>
</ul><p> 
</p>
<p> There have been other discussions of extensions to the
	bundle protocol to address the problem of unsynchronized
	clocks in the context of DTN <a class='info' href='#I-D.farrell-dtnrg-alt-time'>[I&#8209;D.farrell&#8209;dtnrg&#8209;alt&#8209;time]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Farrell, S., McMahon, A., and J.

<a name="rfc.section.2.1"></a><h3>2.1.&nbsp;
The Version</h3>

<p> We propose that version number 7 be assigned to represent
	bundles that include any of the new fields described in this
	proposal.  
</p>
<p> In order to differentiate bundles represented in the
	proposed format, it is customary to choose a different version
	number than that employed any past or current version of the
	bundle protocol.  Although this is optional in our proposal
	(because version 6 bundles may be interpreted as a subset of
	version 7 bundles, with the difference being determined
	entirely via the Bundle Processing Flags, as described in
	<a class='info' href='#proposal-proc'>Section&nbsp;2.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bundle Processing Flags</span><span>)</span></a>), this approach is
	extremely likely to lead to problems with backwards
	compatibility.  Current implementations of DTN do not check
	for the new Bundle Processing Flag values, and therefore would
	misinterpret bundles that used any of the new functionality
	proposed here.

Bundle Lifetime</h3>

<p> This field represents the number of seconds that a bundle
	may exist between its creation and expiration.  This meaning
	is the same as in DTNv6, and is the same for both AT and RT
	modes.  The only difference between AT and RT modes is how the
	calculation of the age of a bundle is performed.  
</p>
<p> In AT mode, the local clock is assumed to be synchronized

	by comparing the difference between the of the local clock and
	the Creation Timestamp of the bundle.  If this difference is
	greater than the Lifetime, then the bundle has expired.

<p> In RT mode, the Creation Timestamp field is not used to

Remaining Lifetime</h3>

<p> This is a new field that does not exist in DTNv6. 
</p>
<p> The "Remaining Lifetime" (RL) field is an SDNV field
	that specifies how many seconds the bundle can remain in the
	system before it expires.  
</p>
<p> The RL is expressed in seconds, as an SDNV.  It is
	decremented as the bundle is processed, and the bundle expires
	when it reaches zero.  
</p>
<p> If the bundle is created in RT mode, then the initial value
	of the Remaining Lifetime field MUST be identical to the value
	of the Lifetime field.  At each hop, the Remaining Lifetime is
	decremented by the length of time that has elapsed since the
	previous hop, rounded down to the nearest second.  
</p>
<p> There are several points in the handling of a bundle
	where the Remaining Lifetime may be decremented by the
	BPA.  These include: 
</p>
<p> </p>
<ul class="text">
<li> When the bundle is received by a convergence layer adapter
	  (CLA).  The CLA may have knowledge about the time required
	  for the bundle to traverse the link, given the size of the
	  bundle, the effective bandwidth of the channel, and the
	  latency or propagation delay of the channel (which may be
	  the most significant factor in the case of links between DTN
	  nodes separated by light-seconds or light-minutes of
	  distance).  
</li>
<li> When the bundle is retrieved from local storage.  
</li>
<li> When the bundle is idle in the BPA for a significant
	  period of time, for any reason, such as waiting for a router
	  to compute a route and choose a CLA.  
</li>
</ul><p> 
</p>
<p> For some applications, such as using DTN to move small
	bundles within a MANET, the effective processing and
	transmission delay may generally be small enough so that the
	only time that the Remaining Lifetime field needs to be
	decremented is when a bundle is retrieved from local storage. 
	For other applications, such moving large bundles between deep
	space nodes, the channel latency and transmission delays must
	also be considered.

The Granularity of the Remaining Lifetime</h3>

<p> If a bundle is forwarded "quickly" through a node, and the
	transfer time is small, then its RL might not be decremented
	(since the elapsed time is always rounded down to the nearest
	second, and many bundles will require less than one second to
	receive and forward).  Therefore a bundle may survive for many
	seconds longer than its RL, as long as it continues to make
	steady progress hops.  The only time that the RL will be
	decremented is if the bundle is "stalled" in a node and
	remains there for longer than one second.  
</p>
<p> Is this what we want, or should the RL be measured in a
	finer unit (milliseconds?  microseconds?  nanoseconds?), so
	that it is decremented even when a bundle is forwarded without
	only a very small amount of delay, and bundles can still
	expire even if they are never stalled?

</p>
<p> </p>
<ol class="text">
<li> If the device has access to an accurate clock, or can

</li>
<li> Assume that no time has passed since the shut down and
	  that the local clock has not been altered.  The remaining

</li>
<li> Assume that a period of time equal to the expected time
	  required to shut down and restart the node has elapsed.

</li>
<li> Assume that an unknown and potentially large period of

	  reduce to the previous case).  
</li>
<li> Assume that a period of time greater than the longest

Discussion</h3>

<p> The process of conversion between RT and AT mode may break
	  central assumptions about how bundles may be uniquely

	  Creation Timestamp as part of their check to see whether a
	  given bundle has already been seen.  If there are two
	  versions of the bundle (one in RT mode, and the other in AT
	  mode) then this test will not reliably detect duplicates
	  unless additional steps are taken to normalize the bundle
	  header fields before comparison.  
</p>
<p> An additional problem is that this rewriting is not
	  backwards-compatible with BSP, because it changes the length
	  of the bundle header and also modifies the value of the
	  Creation Timestamp field, which is part of the canonical
	  representation of the bundle header <a class='info' href='#I-D.irtf-dtnrg-bundle-security'>[I&#8209;D.irtf&#8209;dtnrg&#8209;bundle&#8209;security]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Symington, S., Farrell, S., Weiss, H., and P.

<p> Is it worth providing this mechanism, even though we know

Bundle Status Reports</h3>

<p> Timestamps appear in bundle status reports (i.e., time when

<p> One possible modification, whose interpretation makes sense

	delivered five seconds before it would have expired"), or the

Bundle Lifetime Limits and Incorrect Creation Times</h3>

<p> A malicious or incorrect DTN node may create bundles with

	creates a bundle with a very long Lifetime (in RT or AT mode),

	attacker who slowly clogs the network with many immortal bundles
	that consume resources until the network is unable to accept
	any new bundles. 
</p>
<p> Every DTN node should have a policy about how it will handle
	a bundle with a Creation Timestamp from the future (for AT
	mode), an excessive Lifetime (in AT or RT mode) or Remaining
	Lifetime (in RT mode).  How such a policy is specified is
	beyond the scope of this document.
