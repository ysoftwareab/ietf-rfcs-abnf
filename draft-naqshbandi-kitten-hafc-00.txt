INTERNET DRAFT Hybrid Algorithm to enhance Authentication in Fog Computing  August 8, 2018


   Abstract

   This document specifies the problem of attack on authenticity users. 
   The problem is discussed with respect to fog computing environment. 
   The threat exist when any user log in to access the service.
   The two aspects are either the fog server is fake or the user node 
   is fake. The information stored on the server and transferred over 
   the connection. This information can be highly confidential and 
   sensitive. So to enhance security in this scenario, cloud server can 
   authenticate both the parties and establish the connection. There 
   are chances that it can get attacked and used by illegitimate users. 
   Therefore, there was an utmost need to increase the security on 
   authentication of the users. This document discusses a novel 
   approach to overcome the problem by using a hybrid approach. The 
   technique is based on user authentication and fog authentication
   by cloud server.

INTERNET DRAFT Hybrid Algorithm to enhance Authentication in Fog Computing  August 8, 2018


1  Introduction

   Fog computing is an advancement of cloud computing that came into
   existence to reduce the load on the cloud server. When cloud
   computing did not fulfil the client need like latency, data 
   overload, less computational speed to satisfy the need of clients
   [1]. Fog servers were introduced as the intermediate layer to cloud. 
   They were connected to the clients all the time and sent the data 
   and data decisions to be saved to cloud server [2]. So for clients, 
   the efficiency of the server increased and for cloud server the 
   load also decreased by sharing with fog nodes. Every time when client
   needs to connect to the fog node, they use their credentials to 
   login [3, 4]. But there was no system to authenticate the fog server
   by the user node. In some scenarios,attacker can impersonate as the 
   fog server and communicate with the user node. This is serious 
   security threat on the system. Hence we need to authenticate both
   user node as well the fog server.

2 Requirements Notation


   In examples, "C:" , "F:" and "U:" indicate lines sent by the cloud
   server, fog server and the user node respectively.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3  Terminology

   FLIF :FLIF[5] is a form of progressive interlacing (a generalization
   of the Adam7 algorithm). This means that any partial download of a
   compressed file can be used as a reasonable lossy encoding of the
   entire image.

   Homomorphic encryption[6]: It allows complex mathematical operations
   to be performed on encrypted data without using the original data. 
   For plain texts X1 and X2 and corresponding cipher text Y1 and Y2. 
   A homomorphic encryption scheme permits the computation of X1 (.) X2
   from Y1 and Y2 without using P1 (.) P2. The cryptographic system is
   multiplicative or additive depending on the nature(.).  


4 Authentication Schemes

   Authentication refers to validation of identity to access the
   resources. It can be broadly divided into 2 categories: User based

   authentication and Message authentication. User based authentication
   deals with verifying user's identity. This is done mainly in common
   known systems of authentication. The basic one is called two phase
   that deals with username and password. The three phase approach that
   either deals third component along with earlier two phase ones. The
   third component can be biometric image of face, fingerprint etc. or
   one-time-password based (OTP) or security question.

   Message authentication works on the basic principle on hashing. 
   Every message that is passed to authentication system. It gets 
   encrypted with hash function which gives the output as a hash value. 
   The hash value can then be stored easily. The main algorithms for 
   these functions are  MD5, SHA1, SHA2 and SHA3. The major difference
   between all the algorithms is on the basis of the key size that is 
   used in hashing.


5  Security Considerations


   The general authentications algorithms have been used till now to
   connect to the fog node. But the existing security threats demands
   the authentication algorithm to be more randomized as possible.
   Therefore, there is need of algorithms that encompasses the
   properties of the user based algorithm along with the message
   authentication algorithms. In this draft, we propose a hybrid
   approach that uses homomorphic encryption on fingerprint based login
   system to authenticate user. For authenticating the fog server, an
   OTP based authentication technique along with homomorphic
   encryption.

   In our proposed hybrid system, an user logs in for using the cloud
   service or fog service by providing the credentials(username,
   password, fingerprint). Then the credentials are encrypted using
   homomorphic encryption and sent to the server for authentication.
   Once it reaches the server, then gets decrypted and verified. If the
   user is legitimate, then the service is granted to the nearest fog
   server which is already authenticated. The allotment of fog server 
   to complete the request generated by user is provided by cloud 
   server.

   The proposed system authenticates the fog server using OTP based
   technique. After defined time slot, the cloud server sends the OTP 
   to fog servers. If the OTP is verified, then the fog server is 
   authentic otherwise it is attacked and impersonated by attacker.

   1. User node sends request to access service along with credentials
   encrypted.

   2. Fog server send request for its authentication.

   3. If fog server is authenticated, then its location is stored in
   database.

   4. If the user is authenticated, then service is grant to nearest fog
   server.

   5. Whenever the service has to be accessed, the communication with
   fog server starts.

   6. Fog server responds to user node by providing appropriate
   decisions.

   The hashing function that is being used in SHA3 should have large
   function values so that attacker cant' decrypt.

   authenticity of users and fog nodes by the cloud server. It is a two
   step technique that uses homomorphic encryption while establishing
   the connection of the data.
