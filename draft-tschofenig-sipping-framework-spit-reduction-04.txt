Abstract

   Spam, defined as sending unsolicited messages to someone in bulk, is
   likely to become a problem on SIP open-wide deployed networks.  A
   number of solutions have been proposed for dealing with Spam for
   Internet Telephony (SPIT) and unwanted communication, such as content
   filtering, black lists, white lists, consent-based communication,

   reputation systems, address obfuscation, limited use addresses,
   turing tests, computational puzzles, payments at risk, circles of
   trust, and many others.

   This document describes the big picture that illustrates how the
   different building blocks fit together and can be deployed

Internet-Draft         Framework for Reducing Spam             July 2008


1.  Introduction

   The problem of Spam for Internet Telephony (SPIT) is an imminent
   challenge and only the combination of several techniques can provide
   a way to deal with unwanted communication attempts.

   [RFC5039] provides four core recommendations that need to be
   considered for a SPIT solution, namely

   o  Strong Identity
   o  White Lists
   o  Solve the Introduction Problem
   o  Don't Wait Until its Too Late

   This document illustrates how existing building blocks can be put
   together to be able to recognize unwanted communication attempts and
   to execute appropriate actions.  Ideally, a framework should allow
   new building blocks to be added as adversaries become more
   sophisticated.  Since there are strong economical incentives for
   adversary to exploit communication networks that are widely deployed
   it only possible to detect and react on unwanted communication
   attempts in such a way that the total number of unwanted
   communication attempts reaches a level that is acceptable for the end
   user considering false positives and the additional burden for the
   users using these mechanisms.

   The purpose of this document defines a model of internal device
   processing, protocol interfaces, and terminology to illustrate a way
   in which SPIT prevention techniques can be added in a seamless
   fashion.  This document focuses on the descripion of how to combine
   different building blocks in an architectural fashion.  No specific
   pre-selection is being provided on what mechanism should be
   standardized or implemented by various parties.  This is left to the
   parties deploying these mechanisms and, when it comes to
   standardization, subject of a separate document to pick an initial
   set of mechanisms to start with.


2.  Terminology

   This document does not contain normative language.


3.  Framework

   Figure 1 shows the interaction between the end host and a SIP proxy
   belonging to its VoIP provider.  One important part of the overall
   solution is the ability to make authorization decisions based on

   incoming communication attempts.  The entity that writes these
   authorization rules is referred as Rule Maker.  A human, acting as
   the Rule Maker, might enter policies via some form of graphical user
   interface; some other policies may be generated automatically by
   observing the behavior of the user.  Furthermore, in certain
   deployment environments an initial rule set will be provided by some
   third party entity, such as the enterprise system administrator or
   the VoIP service provider.

   Policies are processed by corresponding module within the SIP proxy,
   called Authorization Engine, that interacts with the message routing
   component.  By following this architectural approach the Policy
   Decision Point (PDP) and the Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) are
   closely combined.  As such, authorization policies are stored at at a
   SIP proxy rather than the SIP UA client itself.  The implications of
   relocating these two functions, PDP and PEP, to the SIP UA client are
   described in Appendix A.

                            Figure 1: Overview

   Assume that an arbitrary entity transmits a message to a specific URI
   that finally hits the SIP proxy on the recipients side.  Information
   provided within that message are used as input to the rule
   evaluation.  Any part of the message may serve as input to the
   evaluation process but for practical reasons a few selected fields do
   most of the work.  There are three aspects to consider when it comes
   to the rule evaluation:

   Where does identity information come from?

      Authentication information can come in different forms, depending
      on the chosen SIP security mechanism (e.g., P-Asserted-ID
      [RFC3325] or SIP Identity [RFC4474]).  Additionally, the
      interworking with the privacy mechanisms, such as [RFC3323] or
      [I-D.ietf-sip-ua-privacy] need to be considered.

Internet-Draft         Framework for Reducing Spam             July 2008


      An example of how these different mechanisms are being considered
      during the rule evaluation is described in Common Policy [RFC4745]
      and Presence Authorization Policy [RFC5025].

   What is the quality of the authentication procedure?

      When evaluating authorization policies with respect to an incoming
      request the identity information of the entity sending the message
      may provide enough information when the recipient authorized that
      specific sender's identity.  However, when the authorization
      policies refer to entire domains instead of individual users then
      it would be valuable to know how easily users within that specific
      domain are able to aquire their identities and how strong the
      authentication procedure actuallly is.  Consider the following
      example: an enterprise network provisions entities to employees
      only and the authentication credentials are based on a smart card
      based mechanism.  In an other case new identities can be created
      on the fly using a protocol interaction with an email-address
      based return routability check without additional verification.
      As such, in these two examples the chances to hold a real-world
      person accountable for their actions is very likely to be
      different in case that abuse reports are received by the two VoIP
      providers.  Unfortunately, information about such a process is
      often not available when the authorization decision is being made.

   Who creates the policies?

      Identity based authorization rules may contain entries for
      specific users or for entire domains.  Such policies may be
      configured by the end host as a Rule Maker or by the VoIP provider
      themself.  Particularly the later part is likely to be attractive
      for VoIP providers since they may be able to form federations of
      VoIP providers that fulfill certain preconditions with respect to
      their VoIP / IM usage.  These type of federations are also the
      basis for getting SIP SAML [I-D.ietf-sip-saml] to work since a
      valid digital signature together with the presence of certain
      assertions statements is insufficient as a basis for trusting
      their content.

   As illustrated above, there are various possible actions that may be
   taken by the receipient or it's VoIP provider to authorize the
   message sender.  Some of these mechanisms may require interaction
   with the sender.  The request for authorization might require the
   message sender to be challenged (e.g., via hash cash
   [I-D.jennings-sip-hashcash], via SIP payment
   [I-D.jennings-sipping-pay], or via CAPTCHAs
   [I-D.tschofenig-sipping-captcha]).  Some other mechanisms, such as
   SIP Identity do not require the verifying entity to challenge the

   authentication service since the identity assertion is pushed towards
   the recipient.

   Additionally, it is possible to utilize mechanisms the Consent
   Framework [I-D.ietf-sipping-consent-framework] or the Information
   Event Package [RFC3857] to allow the recipient to authorize a
   request.

   Figure 2 shows this integration step.  The conditions part of the
   rule offer a mechanisms to incrementally extend the overall framework
   with new components.  Depending on the outcome of the rule
   evaluation, the message may be re-routed to another entity, such as
   an answering machine, to the recipient, rejected or other actions are
   triggered.  The latter aspect is particularly interesting since it
   allows further solution components to be executed.

   Note that some traffic analysis and consequently some form of content
   filtering (e.g., of MESSAGEs) message be applied locally within the
   VoIP provider's domain also under the control of the end user.
   However, this is largely an implementation-specific technique without
   protocol impact.  For example, consider a VoIP provider that wants to
   utilize a statistical analysis tool for Spam prevention.  It is not
   necessary to standardized the algorithms nor protocols; the impact
   for the authorization policies is mainly the ability to allow the
   Rule Maker to enable or to disable the usage of these statistical
   techniques and potentially to map the output of the analysis process
   to value range from 0 (i.e., the message is not classified as Spam)
   and 100 (i.e., the message was classified as Spam).  A Rule Maker may
   decide to act with an appropriate action on a certain level of Spam

   marking.

   Authenticated Identities:

      Initial VoIP provider are likely to secure their SIP signaling
      using Transport Layer Security (TLS) or IP security (IPsec)
      between neighboring providers and use P-Asserted-ID [RFC3325].

         Note: SIP Identity is comparable to DomainKeys Identified Mail
         (DKIM) [I-D.ietf-dkim-overview] used for associating a
         "responsible" identity with an email message and provides a
         means of verifying that the association is legitimate.

      SIP Identity [RFC4474] is a proposal for stronger security
      mechanisms used to provide the verification service with the
      authenticated identity.  SIP Identity is a reasonably simple
      specification and does not rely on a huge amount of infrastructure
      support.

      This framework does not assume a specific mechanism for asserting
      identities to be used but a strong identity mechanism is a pre-
      requisity for authorization policy handling to be successful.

   Authorization Policies:

      Even if policy decision making and policy enforcement is done
      outside the SIP UA client then still there might not be a need to
      standardize an authorization policy language if the policies can
      be modified via a webpage.  This approach of policy handling is
      done in many cases today already for various applications.

      Unfortunately, this approach tends to become cumbersome for end
      users and therefore it is better to hide a lot of policy details
      from the end user itself and to make use of context information,
      for example, address books and authorization policies available
      already created for presence based systems.

      Additionally, a user may have multiple devices and a consistent
      view of the policies should be provided.

      An example solution for authorization policies for dealing with
      reducing unwanted communication is described in
      [I-D.tschofenig-sipping-spit-policy] with the requirements
      detailed in [I-D.froment-sipping-spit-requirements].

   There is still one significant problem unsolved: since white lists
   need to be created somehow and hence there is an introduction
   problem.  Section 4 discusses this aspect in more details.

4.  Communication Patterns and User Groups

   When communication takes place then at least three types of groups
   can be identified.

4.1.  Closed Groups

   People in this group communicate only with the peers in their group.
   They do not appreciate communication attempts from outside.
   Communication is possible only for people within this list.  Here is
   an example of a closed group: Consider parents that do not want their
   children from getting contacted by strangers.  Hence, they may want
   to create a white list containing the identifies of known friends,
   parents and other relatives on behalf of their kids.

   The usage of authorization policies for usage with closed groups is
   straight forward.  The introduction problem is also not considered
   very large given that the identities of the individual entities are
   typically known in an out-of-band fashion.

4.2.  Semi-Open Groups

   In a semi-open environment all members of the same group are allowed
   to get in contact with everyone else (e.g., persons working within
   the same company are allowed to contact each other without
   restrictions).  For the communication with persons outside the
   company the communication patters depend on the role of the specific
   person (e.g., standardization people, sales people, etc.) and on the
   work style of the person.

   For this category we distinguish a number of (non-spam) message
   sources based on their characteristics:

   o  "friends" or "acquaintances", i.e., those we have communicated
      with before.
   o  strangers, divided into 'interesting' and 'uninteresting'.  The
      latter are messages from people that someone does not care to have
      a conversation with or respond to, at least at that particular
      moment.

   Strangers can be defined by individual names or whole domains.  A
   special class of 'stranger' messages are transaction-related
   communications, such as automated messages or calls from an airline
   or shipping company.

   One way to deal with the introduction problem is to make use of
   techniques like hash cash [I-D.jennings-sip-hashcash] or Completely
   Automated Public Turing Test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart



Tschofenig, et al.      Expires January 15, 2009                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft         Framework for Reducing Spam             July 2008


   (CAPTCHA) based robot challenges [I-D.tschofenig-sipping-captcha].
   Alternatively, a communication attempt may also be forwarded to an
   answering maschine or alternative ways of establishing the initial
   interaction may be proposed.

   The usage of authorization policies for usage with Semi-Open Groups
   is challenging but is considered manageable.

4.3.  Open Groups

   People in this type of group are not allowed to limit communication
   attempts.  Help desks, certain people in governmental agencies,
   banks, insurance companies, etc.

   For open groups a solution for providing SPIT prevention is far more
   complicated.  Consider a person working on a customer support
   helpdesk.  Ideally, they would like to receive only calls from
   friendly customers (although the motivation for calling is most
   likely a problem they experience) and the topic of the calls only
   relates to problems they are able to solve.  Without listening to the
   caller they will have a hard time to know whether the call could be
   classified as SPIT or not.  Another extreme case is a Public Safety
   Answering Point where emergency service personell is not allowed to
   reject calls either.

   Many SPIT prevention techniques might not be applicable since
   blocking callers is likely not possible and applying other
   techniques, such as turing tests, might not be ideal in an case of
   open groups.

   Providing additional information about the caller may be helpful from
   the called party VoIP provider but cannot be considered sufficient.
   A more promising approach is the ability to provide abuse reporting
   in the style of [XEP-0161] to provide the ability for punishment in
   case of misuse.  This approach is helpful if an honest VoIP provider
   has to deal with a small number of adversaries within their network
   and the abuse reporting entity is trusted by that VoIP provider as
   well.  This technique is not helpful when VoIP provider itself is
   convolated in sending spam messages or has some other financial
   benefits from not holding the adversary accountable.  Another
   possible approach is to establish blacklisted domains within a
   federation, as this is common practice within the email domain.

4.4.  Summary

   Based on the discussions regarding communication patters and groups
   the following observations can be made:




Tschofenig, et al.      Expires January 15, 2009               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft         Framework for Reducing Spam             July 2008


   o  A single person very likely has many roles and they may have an
      impact on the communication patterns.
         For example, consider a person who is working in a company but
         also want to be available for family members.
   o  The context in which a person is may change at any time.  For
      example, a person might be available for family members while at
      work except during an important meeting where communication
      attempts may be rejected.  Switching a context has an impact for
      reachability and the means for communicating with a specific
      recipient, based on enabled rule sets.

   From an authorization policy point of view it is important to be able
   to express a sphere (i.e., the state a user is in) and to switch
   between different spheres easily by thereby switching to a different
   rule set.

4.5.  Usability

   An important aspect in the usage of authorization policies is to
   assist the user when creating policies.  Ideally, the policies should
   be established automatically.  Below, there are a couple of examples
   to illustrate the idea given that these aspects are largely
   implementation issues:

   o  It must be possible for the proxy to automatically add addresses
      on outbound messages and calls to the rule set.  This approach is
      similar to stateful packet filtering firewalls where outbound
      packets establish state at the firewall to allow inbound packets
      to traverse it again.
   o  Already available information in the address book can be used for
      building the policy rules there is quite likely already a
      relationship available with these persons existent.
   o  A large amount of email is non-personal, automated communication,
      such as newsletters, confirmations and legitimate advertisements.
      These are often tagged as spam by content filters.  This type of
      correspondence is usually initiated by a transaction over the web,
      such as a purchase or signing up for a service.
      [I-D.shacham-http-corr-uris], for example, defines an HTTP header
      for conveying future correspondence addresses that can be
      integrated in the rule set.


5.  Protocol Interactions

   This section describes the necessary building blocks that are
   necessary to tie the framework together.

Internet-Draft         Framework for Reducing Spam             July 2008


5.1.  Rule Enforcement via a Trusted Intermediary

   o  Some from of strong identity assurance is required to build the
      basis for identity-based authorization.  SIP Identity [RFC4474] or
      P-Asserted-ID [RFC3325] are examples of available mechanisms.
      These mechanisms allow the authenticated identity of the sending
      party to be determined.
   o  Authorization Policies based on the Common Policy framework
      [RFC4745], as extended in [I-D.tschofenig-sipping-spit-policy] for
      the purpose of SPIT prevention, are mandatory to implement at the
      end host side and at the trusted intermediary.  The implementation
      of the rule evaluation engine might only be necessary on the
      trusted VoIP proxy.  Harmonization with the work done for presence
      authorization [RFC5025], which is based on Common Policy
      [RFC4745], can be accomplished and is highly desirable.
   o  XML Configuration Access Protocol (XCAP) [RFC4825] is used to
      create, modify and delete authorization policies and is mandatory
      to implement at the end host side and at the trusted intermediary.

5.2.  Incremental Deployment

   An important property is incremental deployment of additional
   solution components that can be added and used when they become
   available.  This section aims to illustrate how the extensibility is
   accomplished, based on an example.

   Consider a VoIP provider that provides authorization policies that
   provide the following functionality equivalent to the Common Policy
   framework, i.e., identity-based, sphere and validity based conditions
   initially.  For actions only 'redirection' and 'blocking' is
   provided.  In our example we give this basic functionality the AUID
   'new-spit-policy-example' with the namespace
   'urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:new-spit-policy-example'.

   When a client queries the capabilities of a SIP proxy in the VoIP
   providers network using XCAP the following exchange may take place.


     GET   /xcap-caps/global/index HTTP/1.1
     Host: xcap.example.com

               Figure 3: Initial XCAP Query for Capabilities

       </xcap-caps>

      Figure 4: Initial XCAP Response with the supported Capabilities

   As shown in the example above, Common Policy and the example SPIT
   extension is implemented and the client can upload rules according to
   the definition of the rule set functionality.

   Later, when the VoIP provider updates the functionality of
   authorization policies as more sophisticated mechanisms become
   available and get implemented the functionality of the authorization
   policy engine is enhanced with, for example, hashcash and the ability
   to perform statistical analysis of signaling message.  The latter
   functionality comes with the ability to mark messages are Spam and
   the ability for end users to enable/disable this functionality.  We
   use the namespaces 'urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:hashcash' and
   'urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:statistical-analysis' for those.

   A end user could now make use of these new functions and a capability
   query of the SIP proxy would provide the following response.


     GET   /xcap-caps/global/index HTTP/1.1
     Host: xcap.example.com

   New SPIT handling functionality may extend condition, actions and/or
   transformation elements of a rule.

5.3.  Botnets

   A botnet is a large number of compromised maschines that are used to
   create and send spam or viruses or flood a network with messages as a
   denial of service attack.

   Such a botnet represents a significant challenge for a VoIP
   infrastructure and also for the mechanisms proposed in this document.
   Recently observed attacks indicated that some botnets tried to steal
   credentials to distribute messages with "real" identities.  To deal
   with the threat it is useful to classify the behavior of these bots
   into three categories, namely

   o  The botnet does not have access to the user's credentials.  In
      this case identity-based white lists provides adequate protection.
   o  The botnets does have access to user's credentials of compromised
      maschines but distributes messages in a random fashion.  In this
      case identity-based white lists provides adequate protection since
      it is unlikely that the recipient will have that person in their
      whitelist.
   o  In this category the botnet has access to the user's credentials
      and utilizes addresses from the user's addressbook.  In this case
      whitelists do not provide a proper protection.  Since the

Internet-Draft         Framework for Reducing Spam             July 2008


      recipient knows the sender of the message it would, in many cases,
      be able to get in contact with him or her and report the observed
      problem.  This approach does not work with a pure maschine-to-
      maschine communication environment without user involvement.


6.  Privacy Considerations

   This document does not propose to distribute the user's authorization
   policies to other VoIP providers nor is the configuration of policies
   at SIP proxies other than the trusted user's VoIP provider necessary.
   Furthemore, if blocking or influencing of the message processing is
   executed by the VoIP provider then they have to be explicitly enabled
   by the end user.  Blocking of messages, even if it is based on
   "super-clever" machine learning techniques often introduces
   unpredictability.

   Legal norms from fields of law can take regulative effects in the
   context of SPIT processing, such as constitutional law, data
   protection law, telecommunication law, teleservices law, criminal
   law, and possibly administrative law.  See, for example, [Law1],
   [Law2] and [Law3].  For example, it is mandatory to pass full control
   of SPIT filtering to the end user, as this minimises legal problems.

   An overview about regulatory aspects can be found in [Spit-AL].


7.  Example

   This section shows an example whereby we consider a user
   Bob@company-example.com that writes (most likely via a nice user
   interface) the following policies.  We use a high-level language to
   show the main idea of the policies.

   RULE 1:
        IF identity=alice@foo.example.com THEN ACCEPT
        IF identity=tony@bar.example.com THEN ACCEPT

   RULE 2:
        IF domain=company-example.com THEN ACCEPT

   RULE 3:
        IF unauthenticated THEN
               EXECUTE hashcash

   RULE 4:
        IF <hashcash result="success"/>
        THEN
           REDIRECT sip:voicebox@company-example.com

   RULE 5:
        IF <hashcash result="failure"/>
        THEN
           block

                    Figure 7: Example of Bob's Rule Set

   At some point in time Bob uploads his policies to the SIP proxy at
   his VoIP providers SIP proxy.


         PUT
         /spit-policy/users/sip:bob@company-example.com/index/~~/ruleset

         HTTP/1.1
         Content-Type:application/spit+xml
         Host: proxy.home-example.com

          <<<< Added policies go in here. >>>>

                  Figure 8: Uploading Policies using XCAP

   When BoB receives a call from his friends, alice@foo.example and
   tony@bar.example.com, then all the rules related to the spit policy
   are checked.  Only the first rule (rule 1) matches and is applied.
   Thus, the call is forwarded without any further checks based on Rule
   1.  The rules assume that the authenticated identity of the caller
   has been verified.

   When Bob receives a call from a co-worker,
   Charlie@company-example.com, Rule 2 is applied since the domain part
   in the rule matches the domain part of Charlie's identity.

   Now, when Bob receives a contact from an unknown user, called Mallice
   in this example.  Rule 3 indicates that an extended return-
   routability test using hashcash [I-D.jennings-sip-hashcash] is used
   with the call being redirected to Bob's voicebox afterwards.  This
   exchange is shown in Figure 9.

              Figure 9: Example Exchange: Malice contacts Bob

   Depending on the outcome of the exchange the call is forwarded to a
   mailbox sip:voicebox@company-example.com (in case Malory returned the
   correct solution, see Rule 4) or blocked in case an incorrect
   response was provided.  It might be quite easy to see how this rule
   set can be extended to support other SPIT handling mechanisms as well
   (e.g., CAPTCHAs, SIP Pay, etc.).


8.  Security Considerations

   This document aims to describe a framework for addressing Spam for



Tschofenig, et al.      Expires January 15, 2009               [Page 17]

   Internet Telephony (SPIT) in order to make it simple for users to
   influence the behavior of SIP message routing with an emphasis on
   SPIT prevention.

   The framework relies on three building blocks, namely SIP Identity,
   authorization policies based on Common Policy and Presence
   Authorization Policy, and XCAP.

   As a high-level overview, the framework allows the user to control
   end-to-end connectivity at the SIP message routing level whereby the
   glue that lets all parts fit together is based on authorization
   policies.  Several other solution components can be developed
   independently and can be plugged into the framework as soon as
   available.

   It must be avoided to introduce Denial of Service attacks against the
   recipient by misguiding him or her to install authorization policies
   that allow senders to bypass the policies although that was never
   intended by the recipient.  Additionally, it must not be possible by
   extensions to the authorization policy framework to create policies
   to block legitimate senders or to stall the processing of the
   authorization policy engine.

Appendix A.  Authorization Engine in SIP UA

   When white lists are stored and managed only at the SIP UA client
   then the authorization policies language and the protocol to modify
   the policies do not need to be standardized; they are purely
   implementation specific details.

   While this appears to be an advantage there are various drawbacks
   including the inability to synchronize policies among different
   devices.  Additionally, some information that is typically available
   to the Policy Decision Point may not be available to the end host.
   To avoid standardizing the exchange of such type of information an
   abstract form of Spam marking is proposed in
   [I-D.wing-sipping-spam-score].
