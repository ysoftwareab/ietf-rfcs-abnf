1.  Introduction

   This draft provides a use case that addresses the necessity of a
   dynamic change of an operation plane, which includes multiple virtual
   networks and/or data transmission paths, from a current operation one
   to a backup one through cooperation between inter domain networks
   during a scheduled maintenance or an emergency such as network
   disaster.

   Recently, as reflected in the popularity of acquiring a large amount
   of information from the Internet and using various services, such as
   Internet banking, networks have been indispensable in daily life.
   Therefore, it is important to provide highly reliable end-to-end data
   transmission services.  In addition, even if network facilities are
   extensively damaged due to a natural disaster, data transmission
   services must be promptly restored.  To meet these requirements, a
   highly reliable packet transport network, such as the Multi Protocol
   Label Switching - Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) network, may be used to
   transmit data not only between countries but also between data
   centers.

   In conventional packet transport network management, a data
   transmission path protection function is used for recovering from a
   small network failure such as a node or link failure.  However, the
   path protection is not always usable in a network disaster.  Plenty
   of data transmission paths are calculated individually after
   detecting a network disaster.  As a result, much time is needed to
   calculate all the paths.  In another case, multiple path
   configurations will be changed for maintenance to add, delete, and
   check network resources.  Therefore, a novel network management
   scheme is necessary to change plenty of path configurations
   instantaneously from the current operation plane to the backup one.

   Related documents are the ACTN-framework [ACTN-Framework] and the
   problem statement [ACTN-Problem].

   In Section 2, specific issues on the prompt changing of network
   configurations are discussed.  In Section 3, a use case for an inter-
   domain network management system is described.  In Section 4,
   requirements that the system should satisfy are prescribed.

2.  Problem Statement

   There are two major techniques for recovering from network failures.
   These are protection and restoration.  In protection, a backup data
   transmission path for a current one is calculated in advance.  When a
   data transmission failure is detected, a data transmission path is
   changed from the current path to the backup one.  In restoration, the
   backup path is not prepared in advance.  When a data transmission
   failure is detected, a new data transmission path is calculated and
   data are transmitted through the new calculated data path.

   In a network disaster due to an earthquake, for example, protection
   paths might not be useful for some situations.  When the protection
   paths are not useful, another backup path should be calculated.  If
   there are plenty of current data transmission paths, it takes an
   enormous amount of time to calculate the backup paths.  In the same
   way, a huge amount of time is needed to calculate plenty of paths for
   restoration.

   Enhancement of protection is envisaged as a new recovery procedure
   from a network disaster.  Specifically, a concept of a virtual
   operation plane is adopted.  The virtual operation plane includes
   multiple data transmission paths.  Multiple current data transmission
   paths are included in the current operation plane.  Multiple backup
   data transmission paths are included in a recovery operation plane.
   In the new recovery procedure, multiple backup operation planes are
   prepared in advance.  When a network disaster is detected, the most
   suitable backup operation plane is selected and configurations for
   recovery are distributed to data transmission nodes.

   In addition, a network system must be able to change plenty of path
   configurations instantaneously when it adds or deletes network
   resources or stops to use resources to execute maintenance.

   The system explained above can be easily managed if there is only one
   management server.  However, if the network is composed of multiple
   domains and there are multiple management servers, cooperated network
   disaster recovery procedures are not easy to execute.  Therefore, a
   cooperative management scheme for recovering from a network disaster
   is needed.

3.  Use Case

   A target operation plane change system through cooperation of
   multiple domain management servers is shown in Figure 1.  A whole
   network is composed of multiple domain networks such as a domain-A
   network and a domain-B network.  Each domain has a domain management
   server.  In addition, each domain is composed of multiple packet
   transport nodes.  An end-to-end data transmission path is managed
   through cooperating between domain management servers.  Each domain
   management server calculates multiple current data transmission paths
   and manages them as one current operation plane.  In addition, the
   management server calculates multiple backup operation planes and
   manages them in case of a network disaster.

   For example, the domain-A management server prepares a backup
   operation plane, plane-A1, based on the assumption of network
   failures or maintenance.  Plane-A1 includes multiple data
   transmission paths or virtual networks.  The domain-B management
   server prepares another backup operation plane, plane-B1, to connect
   data transmission paths to plane-A1 of the domain-A.  On the other
   hand, the domain-B management server prepares another backup
   operation plane, plane-B2, based on the assumption of other network
   failures or maintenance.  The domain-A management server prepares
   another backup operation plane, plane-A2, to connect data
   transmission paths to plane-B2 of the domain-B.

   When the domain-A management server changes the operation plane from
   the current operation one to plane-A1 during the network operation,
   it transmits an identifier of plane-A1 to the domain-B management
   server to show a change of the operation plane of the domain-A
   management server.  After receiving the identifier of plane-A1, the
   domain-B management server changes the operation plane from the
   current one to plane-B1.

   To develop the above-mentioned system, two interfaces must be
   created.  One is an interface to maintain consistency of the end-to-
   end data transmission paths between domains in the backup operation
   plane.  Specifically, an interface to transmit information of the
   backup operation planes including multiple data transmission paths
   from one domain management server to another domain management server
   is needed between domain management servers.  Another domain
   management server can then calculate backup operation planes
   according to the received backup operation plane information.  The
   other interface is used for transmitting the identifier to change the
   operation plane from one domain management server to another.

4.  Requirement for Interface of operation plane change system

   The interfaces shown in Figure 1 must be prepared to execute
   consistent changing of operation planes to establish end-to-end data
   transmission paths between multiple domain networks for network
   disaster recovery or maintenance.  The requirements for each
   interface are briefly described below.

4.1.  Interface for preparing backup operation planes

   This interface is used to prepare consistent backup operation planes
   by cooperating between domain management servers.  For example, the
   domain-A management server prepares multiple backup operation planes
   for the current operation plane composed of multiple data
   transmission paths.  A backup operation plane is prepared for each
   assumed network failure or maintenance.  The domain-A management
   server transmits "information of sharing paths for each link between
   domains" and "the identifier of a backup operation plane" to the
   domain-B management server when it attempts to change the operation
   plane to recover from a network disaster or to execute maintenance.
   When the domain-B management server receives them, it prepares a
   backup operation plane for each received domain-A management server
   backup plane to establish consistent data transmission paths.  In
   addition, configurations of prepared backup operation planes are
   stored.

4.2.  Interface for requesting change of operation plane

   This interface is used to send a change of the operation plane from
   the current one to the backup one when the domain management server
   detects a network disaster or starts to execute maintenance.  For
   example, when the domain-A management server detects a network
   disaster, it determines the most suitable backup operation plane and
   starts management according to the configurations of the selected
   operation plane.  In addition, the server transmits "the identifier
   of the backup operation plane" to the domain-B management server to
   establish consistent end-to-end paths when it changes the operation
   plane.  When the domain-B management server receives the identifier
   of the backup operation plane, it changes the operation plane from
   the current one to the backup one specified by the received
   identifier.  In addition, information of the time to change path
   configurations is exchanged through this interface between domain
   management servers.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document describes problems and requirements for network
   disaster recovery or maintenance by cooperating between domain
   management functions or servers.  The system might be composed of
   multiple management functions to manage each domain network, and each
   management function might be implemented in different computational
   equipment.  To achieve network disaster recovery in a coordinated
   manner between multiple network domains, it is necessary to exchange
   information between them.  It is therefore necessary to use a secure
   communication channel between the domain management functions.
