 Abstract

   This document defines a new Outbound Router Filter type for BGP,
   termed "Extended Community Outbound Route Filter", that can be used
   to perform extended community based route filtering.

1. Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119].


2. Introduction

   The Cooperative Outbound Route Filtering Capability defined in [BGP-
   ORF] provides a mechanism for a BGP speaker to send to its BGP peer a
   set of Outbound Route Filters (ORFs) that can be used by its peer to
   filter its outbound routing updates to the speaker.

   This document defines a new Outbound Router Filter type for BGP
   [BGP-4], termed "Extended Community Outbound Route Filter", that can
   be used to perform the extended community [BGP-EXT-COMMUNITIES] based
   route filtering.


3. Extended Communities ORF-Type

   The Extended Community ORF-Type allows to express ORFs in terms of
   BGP Extended Communities. That is, the Extended Communities ORF-Type
   provides Extended Communities-based route filtering.

   Conceptually the ORF-value of the Extended Communities ORF-Type
   consists of a single Extended Community.

   The sender SHOULD set the value of the Match field to PERMIT; the
   receiver SHOULD ignore the value of the Match field.

   The remote peer should consider only those routes whose Extended
   Communities attribute has at least one Extended Community in common
   with the Extended Communities list specified in the ORF.

4. Extended Communities ORF Encoding

   The value of the ORF-Type for the Extended Communities ORF-Type is 3.

   The type-specific part of Extended Communities ORF-Type consists of a
   single Extended Community encoded as an eight-octets field.


5. IANA Considerations

   This document specifies a new Outbound Route Filtering (ORF) type,
   Extended Community ORF. The value of the ORF-type is 3.


6. Security Considerations

   This extension to BGP does not change the underlying security issues.
