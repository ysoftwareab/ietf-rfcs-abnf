Abstract

   Several papers in the May 2008 P2PI workshop have argued that there
   is a need to build new protocol mechanisms to accommodate peer-to-
   peer traffic in networks in the most efficient way and with minimal
   impact to other traffic.  This paper presents an analysis of such
   solutions from the point of view of the incentives of the different
   parties involved in peer-to-peer traffic.  The paper concludes that
   it is essential to understand the incentives in order to have a
   deployable solution.

Internet-Draft             P2P and Incentives                  July 2008


1.  Introduction

   Peer-to-peer (P2P) networking has been cited as the leading consumer
   of network bandwidth in networks serving private subscribers.  This
   is by itself not a problem, as the network providers are in the
   business of providing a service to their customers, including the
   ones that employ P2P tools.  However, the issue is whether P2P
   traffic causes undue congestion and reduced level of service for
   other customers in the network [I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-relax-fairness].

   Historically, the Internet service provider market has developed for
   interactive services where the bandwidth requirements for each user
   vary significantly from over time.  This allowed the service
   providers to employ statistical multiplexing.  At the same time, the
   nominal link speeds have been a major factor in marketing Internet
   service.  But during the last few years, the nature of the traffic
   has changed from interactive to more always-on type traffic, for
   instance from P2P applications.  As a result, statistical
   multiplexing is no longer effective, and service providers are
   finding that a large sets of users are actually trying to utilize
   their full link speed at all times.  This is making the service
   providers either increase the capacity of their networks to match the
   changing traffic mix and increasingly high broadband service speeds,
   or find other ways to deal with the problems.

   It is important to see that these problems are not limited to P2P
   tools [P2PI.daigle].  Indeed, not even all P2P applications have
   these problems.  Some forms of video communication exhibit the same
   problems that large file sharing P2P applications do [P2PI.hardie].
   And as the Internet applications evolve, we expect to see new forms
   of traffic with these issues.  In the remainder of this paper, we
   assume any bandwidth-intensive, semi-permanently running application
   that may or may not attempt to be friendly with other network usage.

   The fairness problem can present itself in various ways.  For
   instance, users opening multiple transport sessions may get a
   disproportionate share of a congested link.  Permanent, high
   bandwidth sessions may slow down the ramp-up of short-term,
   interactive sessions.  Or some users may utilize a transit link far
   more than others, resulting in these users gaining a larger share of
   the transit costs that the provider has to pay.

   These problems are not just abstract issues.  There has been highly
   publicized debates about what forms of traffic management are
   acceptable for network providers.  In reality, network providers
   already employ a number of techniques [P2PI.tschofenig].  Solutions
   addressing issues in this space have been worked on by network
   providers, vendors, and researchers.  This paper looks at the

   different classes of solutions in Section 2 and analyzes them based
   on the incentives of the involved parties in Section 3.  The key
   issue is finding a solution that provides immediate benefits to
   everyone who needs to add new mechanisms or equipment.  Another key
   issue is the information available to different parties.  This leads
   us to make conclusions in Section 4.


2.  Solution Classes

   A number of solutions have already been deployed to mitigate issues
   caused by the changed traffic pattern.  Other solutions are actively
   being worked on.  We divide the solutions in three rough classes,
   based partially on similar classifications in [P2PI.tschofenig]
   [P2PI.moncaster]:

   Contractual

      These solutions are based on choosing pricing models and
      contractual conditions that persuade users to avoid always-on
      traffic.  For instance, volume-based accounting can be employed,
      or the contracts of the heaviest users can be discontinued.

   Voluntary changes in applications

      These solutions are based on some change of behaviour in the
      applications, leading to taking other users better into account,
      reducing congestion or the use of expensive links, and so on.

      Some of the solutions in this category include:

      *  Indicating the desired quality of service, so that interactive
         and always-on applications can be distinguished in the network
         [P2PI.moncaster].  This assumes that there is a basic level of
         quality of service filtering capabilities in the network.

      *  Making decisions with better information about the network
         topology and cost.  For instance, algorithms that P2P
         applications use to determine which peers to talk to can
         probably be improved.  One particular class of improvements
         involves "oracles" in the service provider network to help
         applications determine the most likely peers with good
         connectivity.  For instance, peers that are in the local
         service provider network vs. behind an expensive and/or
         congested transit service provider.

      *  New congestion control mechanisms.  For instance, BitTorrent
         has gotten positive results from their new algorithm



Arkko                   Expires January 30, 2009                [Page 3]

         [P2PI.shalunov].  Another example is Bob Briscoe's re-ECN
         mechanism [I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-re-ecn-tcp], which allows hosts
         and networks to co-operate in the treatment of congestion, and
         allows networks to treat different users in a fair manner.

   Network-based mechanisms

      These mechanisms are implemented solely in the network.  Examples
      include:

      *  Prioritization, slowdown, or even blocking of traffic based on
         packet header information.  Relatively complicated designs that
         peek further into the packet, Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) have
         also been deployed.  Priorities can also be set based on user
         accounting information, e.g., traffic shaping heavy users
         during a rush hour.

      *  Changing the "scheduling algorithm", by attempting to complete
         the short jobs first everyone's performance will improve.
         Similar techniques as discussed above are needed to determine
         which jobs are "short" and "long", however.

      *  Building caches and peer-to-peer network components in the
         service provider network.


3.  Incentives

   This section discusses motives, deployment considerations, and how
   information available to the different parties affects the
   incentives.

3.1.  Motives

   For any solution to be adopted the involved parties have to have
   compatible motives.  This is not always trivial, because the parties
   may either optimize for different goals, or because there is room for
   malicious behaviour.

   For instance, one type of a quality-of-service solution involves
   voluntary marking of packets by applications and subsequent
   differentiated treatment of these packets by the network.  In this
   case the motives of well-behaving users and service providers are
   similar: both want interactive applications to be given more
   priority, while allowing always-on batch applications to run in the
   background, and take as much bandwidth as is available.  However, if
   the prioritization happens across multiple users, this also implies
   that a lower priority marking has the potential to reduce the user's

   share of the overall throughput.  Clever users can distort the system
   by claiming to run only interactive applications.  A tragedy of the
   commons follows: The optimal strategy from the point of view of the
   entire group of users would be to correctly classify traffic.  But
   from the point of an individual user a better strategy would be to
   lie.

   Note that no misbehaviour is needed from a human user for this to
   happen.  It is enough that the user runs applications that do this.
   And if such applications appear to produce better results than other
   applications, the user has an incentive to use them.  Having said
   this, past experience tells us that a vast majority of networking
   software plays by the rules.  Attempts to improve or bypass TCP
   congestion control are relatively rare, for instance.

   An example where the motives themselves may be conflict is the co-
   operation between P2P applications and service providers to determine
   the "best" peers to connect to.  The definition of "best" from the
   P2P client perspective is a peer that has the highest possible actual
   transfer rate.  But the service provider is more interested in
   minimization of their costs and overall network congestion.  This may
   or may not coincide with the client's desires.  For instance, a
   service provider may prefer a local peer with a slow access link over
   a remote peer that is connected via an expensive transit connection.

   While not part of the incentives, the available information to the
   different parties plays an interesting role as well.  It can be
   expected that P2P nodes are capable of measuring actual transfer
   rates across the end-to-end path, including the behaviour of the end
   systems.  P2P applications might even be able to accumulate this
   information from multiple clients and over time.  In contrast, the
   service provider network at its basic form would be limited to
   understanding the topology and link speeds.  More advanced service
   provider networks may be capable of traffic-engineering and tracking
   congestion in different parts of their network.  However, they are
   fundamentally incapable of measuring end systems or end-to-end
   behaviour in paths that cross multiple networks.

   As a result of the motive conflict and lack of information, any
   "oracle" style design [RIPE.feldmann] needs to play a fairly limited
   role in supplying additional information to the P2P applications.
   Information from the service provider network can help make an
   initial guess or to narrow the search for the best peer.  But it
   cannot replace or govern the overall decision that the P2P
   application needs to make on its own.

   Having basic support for peer selection in the P2P applications also
   allows the service providers to focus on improvements in their own



Arkko                   Expires January 30, 2009                [Page 5]

   network, as opposed to attempting to build tools that try to guide
   selection of peers across multiple networks.  As long as the oracle
   focuses on increasing the number of peers within the service
   provider's network, the algorithms in P2P applications can take care
   of optimizing the connectivity to peers in other networks.

3.2.  Deployment Considerations

   Another important consideration is what needs to change in order for
   a particular solution to be deployed.  Some solutions can be deployed
   unilaterally, some require coordinated action.  The coordination may
   act as a disincentive to build support for a particular solution.
   For instance, P2P application developers do not invest time in
   building support for contacting an oracle in the service provider
   network until it becomes likely that such oracles can actually used
   in some fraction of networks; the limited development resources are
   better invested in actions that the developers are in full control of
   -- for instance in improved peer selection algorithms that do not
   depend on new infrastructure nodes.  Similarly, service providers do
   not invest in an oracle until there is software that actually uses
   it.

   This problem affects the following types of solutions:

   o  Quality of service marking in the host and priority treatment in
      the network.

   o  Network-assisted P2P peer selection.

   o  Network-assisted congestion control mechanisms.

3.3.  Availability of Information

   Section 3.1 discussed how available information affects the way best
   peer selection can be made to work.  But there are other aspects of
   information availability as well.  Specifically, when networks have
   unilaterally implemented mechanisms that do not align with the
   motives of P2P applications, the applications have employed
   information hiding in order to prevent the network from making non-
   desireable prioritization decisions for them.  Eric Rescorla makes
   the argument that ultimately P2P traffic can be secured and made to
   resemble other types of traffic, such as VPN traffic.  This makes it
   very hard for the network to de-prioritize or modify P2P traffic
   [P2PI.rescorla].  It is interesting that many of the solutions in the
   May 2008 P2PI workshop attempt to increase the amount of information
   available to the parties, while in reality the converse seems to
   happen.

   We would like to suggest that this trend can only be reversed if the
   motives becomes more aligned between the players.  That is, no P2P
   application will participate in a system designed to restrict P2P
   traffic.  But they may participate in systems that attempt to
   optimize P2P traffic.


4.  Conclusions

   The right incentives are a key to the successful standardization and
   deployment of any solution in this space.  Based on our analysis, we
   would like to suggest that the following avenues for IETF
   documentation and standards be looked at:

   o  Improved and/or standardized peer selection algorithms.  These can
      be deployed unilaterally by application developers.

   o  Co-operative designs where service provider networks supply
      additional information that helps the P2P applications to make a
      better initial selection of peers.  This should only be done as a
      sub-item to the above one; service provider networks do not have
      sufficient information or incentives to make the full decision,
      and attempting to do so would dissuade the P2P applications from
      using such a system.

   o  Improved and/or standardized congestion control mechanisms
      suitable for P2P and other "always-on" applications.  Again, these
      can be deployed unilaterally, and IETF can help ensure they
      algorithms are safe for other traffic in the Internet.  Note the
      difference to quality of service mechanisms that typically require
      deployment at both ends; the quality of service mechanisms would
      in many ways be the right solution for this problem, but it is
      hard to get them deployed and used due to the issues mentioned
      earlier in this paper.

      Still, both the co-operative designs and congestion control
      mechanisms depend on the interest of the P2P application
      developers and users.  The primary incentive from their
      perspective is the desire to be nice for the user's other traffic.

   In any case, these items are tactical, short-term efforts.  There is
   an associated longer-term issue where the market place has to learn
   to provide services without relying on statistical multiplexing.
   Ultimately, if there is demand for communication services
   (interactive or not) it should be met with an offering that allows
   providers to build the infrastructure needed to support it, and still
   be profitable.  Pricing models and service packaging has perhaps even
   more to do with this than technical solutions.
