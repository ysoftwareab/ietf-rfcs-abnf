       Improving the caching DNS resolvers on "authority failure"
                   draft-wang-improve-dns-resolver-01

Abstract

   This document provides a new mechanism for caching DNS resolvers.
   When all the authoritative name servers for a zone fail, and the
   request can't be found in the cache, during a period of time the
   caching DNS resolvers won't query the authoritative name servers, but
   directly return a SERVFAIL to the clients to reduce the recursive
   name server load and the network load.

1.  Introduction

   When a DNS caching resolver receives a request from a client, first
   it tries to search in the cache and then query the authoritative name
   servers for the corresponding zone in case that the requested data is
   not cached.

   If all the authoritative name servers for a zone fail, that is they
   are dead or unreachable, the recursive server can get no answers of
   queries for a domain name in that zone, and can not answer the
   clients.  However, the client may keep sending the requests which
   won't be answered before authoritative name servers resume.  The
   repeated requests will flood recursive server, the corresponding
   authoritative name servers and the networks between them.  In this
   situation, the DNS service of the network may be out of service
   because of the flood.  [A similar case like Baofeng media Player
   Accident will cause massive network outage.]

   This document describes a mechanism for the caching DNS resolvers to
   prevent hopeless queries from going to the authoritative name servers
   when all authoritative name servers of the zone of the records are
   out of service.  Therefore DNS reliability is enhanced.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  The status of a zone

   A list of status for all the authoritative name servers for a zone is
   maintained.  When all the authoritative name servers of the zone fail
   (dead,unreachable or answers SERVFAIL), the queries from the caching
   DNS resolver can't be answered or answered with SERVFAIL.  We can
   call this zone in an "authority failure" status, otherwise the zone
   is in the "normal" status.  After setting a zone in the authority
   failure status, a corresponding timer will be set for the zone.  When
   anyone of the authoritative name servers of the zone recovers, the
   status should be changed back to normal status.

   According to [RFC2308], an authoritative name server may be deemed to
   be dead or unreachable if it has not responded to an outstanding
   query within 120 seconds.

4.  New mechanism of the caching DNS resolver

   4.1 Receiving a query for a domain name/RR from a client.

   4.2 If the RRs of domain name queried can be found in the cache of
   the caching DNS resolver, corresponding RRs are returned.

   4.3 Otherwise, the status of the zone which the domain name belongs
   to is checked.

      a.  In normal status, the caching DNS resolver will query the
      authoritative name servers as usual.

      b.  In case of "authority failure",

      b.1 If the timer doesn't expire, the caching DNS resolver will not
      query the authoritative name servers and answer a SERVFAIL
      directly to the clients.

      b.2.  If the timer expires, the caching DNS resolver will query
      the authoritative name servers as usual.  If the query succeeds,
      the status of the zone changes to the normal status.  Otherwise,
      the status is still "authority failure" and the corresponding
      timer is reset.

   The initial value of timer must be reasonable, keeping the balance
   between availability and stability, it should not be longer than 5
   minutes.


5.  IANA Considerations

   [no]


6.  Security considerations

   This document is believed to introduce no additional security
   problems to the current DNS protocol.
