Abstract

   Service Function Chaining (SFC) enables services to be delivered by
   selective traffic steering through an ordered set of service
   functions.  Once classified into an SFC, the traffic for a given flow
   is steered through all the service functions of the SFC for the life
   of the traffic flow even though this is often not necessary.
   Steering traffic to service functions only while required and not
   otherwise, leads to optimal SFCs with improved latencies, reduced
   resource consumption and better user experience.

   This document describes the rationale, techniques and necessary
   protocol extensions to achieve such optimization.

Internet-Draft            SFC SFP Optimization                  Oct 2014


1.  Introduction

   Service function chaining involves steering traffic flows through a
   set of service functions in a specific order.  Such an ordered list
   of service functions is called a Service Function Chain (SFC).  The
   actual forwarding path used to realize an SFC is called the Service
   Function Path (SFP).

   Service functions forming an SFC are hosted at different points in
   the network, often co-located with different types of service
   functions to form logical groupings.  Applying a SFC thus requires
   traffic steering by the SFC infrastructure from one service function
   to the next until all the service functions of the SFC are applied.
   Service functions know best what type of traffic they can service and
   how much traffic needs to be delivered to them to achieve complete
   delivery of service.  As a consequence any service function may
   potentially request, within its policy constraints, traffic no longer
   be delivered to it or its function be performed by the SFC
   infrastructure, if such a mechanism is available.

   This document outlines mechanisms to not steer traffic to service
   functions, on request, while still ensuring compliance to the
   instantiated policy that mandates the SFC.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Definition Of Terms

   This document uses the following terms.  Additional terms are defined
   in [I-D.ietf-sfc-problem-statement], [I-D.ietf-sfc-architecture] and
   [I-D.quinn-sfc-nsh].  Some are reproduced here only for convenience
   and the reader is advised to consult the referenced documents.

   Service Function (SF):  A function that is responsible for specific
       treatment of received packets.  A Service Function can act at the
       network layer or other OSI layers.  A Service Function can be a
       virtual instance or be embedded in a physical network element.
       One of multiple Service Functions can be embedded in the same
       network element.  Multiple instances of the Service Function can
       be enabled in the same administrative domain.  A non-exhaustive
       list of Service Functions includes: firewalls, WAN and
       application acceleration, Deep Packet Inspection (DPI), server
       load balancers, NAT44 [RFC3022], NAT64 [RFC6146], HOST_ID

       injection, HTTP Header Enrichment functions, TCP optimizer, etc.

   Service Node (SN):  A virtual or physical device that hosts one or
       more service functions, which can be accessed via the network
       location associated with it.

   Service Function Forwarder (SFF):  A service function forwarder is
       responsible for forwarding traffic along the service path, which
       includes delivery of traffic to the connected service functions.

   Network Forwarder (NF):  The entity, typically part of the network
       infrastructure, responsible for performing the transport function
       in traffic forwarding.

   Service Controller (SC):  The entity responsible for managing the
       service chains, including create/read/update/delete actions as
       well as programming the service forwarding state in the network -
       SFP distribution.

   Classifier (CF):  The entity, responsible for selecting traffic as
       well as SFP, based on policy, and forwarding the selected traffic
       on the SFP after adding the necessary encapsulation.  Classifier
       is implicitly an SFF.

   Offload:  A request or a directive from the SF to alter the SFP so as
       to remove the requesting SF from the SFP while maintaining the
       effect of the removed SF on the offloaded flow.

   Un-offload:  A request or directive to cancel the effect of Offload -
       leads to altering the SFP so as to insert the requesting SF back
       into the SFP and steer the flow to it.


3.  Service Function Path Optimization

   The packet forwarding path of a SFP involves the classifier, one or
   more SFFs and all the SFs that are part of the SFP.  Packets of a
   flow are forwarded along this path to each of the SFs, for the life
   of the flow, whether SFs perform the full function in treating the
   packet or reapply the cached result, from the last application of the
   function, on the residual packets of the flow.  In other words, every
   packet on the flow incurs the same latency and the end-to-end SFP
   latency remains more or less constant subject to the nature of the
   SFs involved.  If an SF can be removed from the SFP, for a specific
   flow, traffic steering to the SF is avoided for that flow; thus
   leading to a shorter SFP for the flow.  When multiple SFs in a SFP
   are removed, the SFP starts to converge towards the optimum path,
   which in its best case starts and terminates at the classifier itself

   without incurring any latency associated with traversing the SFP.

   Although SFs are removed from the SFP, the corresponding SFC is not
   changed - this is subtle but an important characteristic of this
   mechanism.  In other words, this mechanism does not alter the SFC and
   still uses the SFP associated with the SFC.

   There are two primary approaches to removing an SF from the SFP.
   Namely,

   o  Bypass: Mechanism that alters the SFC.  Described in this draft
      for completeness.

   o  Simple Offload: Mechanism that alters the SFP alone, does not
      affect the SFC.  This is the primary focus of this draft.

3.1.  Bypass

   Many service functions do not deliver service to certain types of
   traffic.  For instance, typical WAN optimization service functions
   are geared towards optimizing TCP traffic and add no value to non-TCP
   traffic.  Non-TCP traffic thus can bypass such a service function.
   Even in the case of TCP, a WAN optimization SF may not be able to
   service the traffic if the corresponding TCP flow is not seen by it
   from inception.  In such a situation a WAN optimization SF can avoid
   the overhead of processing such a flow or reserving resources for it,
   if it had the ability to request such flows not be steered to it.  In
   other words such service functions need the ability to request they
   be bypassed for a specified flow from a certain time in the life of
   that flow.

   A seemingly simple alternative is to require service functions pre
   specify the traffic flow types they add value to, such as the one-
   tuple: IP protocol-type described above.  A classifier built to use
   such data exposed by SFs, may thus enable bypassing such SFs for
   specific flows by way of selecting a different SFC that does not
   contain the SF being removed.

   Although knowledge of detailed SF profiles helps SFC selection at the
   classifier starting the SFC, it leads to shortcomings.

   o  It adds to the overhead of classification at that classifier as
      all SF classification requirements have to be met by the
      classifier.

   o  It leads to conflicts in classification requirements between the
      classifier and the SFs.  Classification needs of different SFs in
      the same SFC may vary.  A classifier thus cannot classify traffic

      based on the classification of one of the SFs in the chain.  For
      instance, even though a flow is uninteresting to one SF on an SFC,
      it may be interesting to another SF in the same SFC.

   o  The trigger for bypassing an SF may be dynamic as opposed to the
      static classification at the classifier - it may originate at the
      SFs themselves and involve the control and policy planes.  The
      policy and control planes may react to such a trigger by
      instructing the classifier to select a different SFC for the flow,
      thereby achieving SF bypass.

3.2.  Simple Offload

   Service delivery by a class of service functions involves inspecting
   the initial portion of the traffic and determining whether traffic
   should be permitted or dropped.  In some service functions, such an
   inspection may be limited to just the five tuple, in some others it
   may involve protocol headers, and in yet others it may involve
   inspection of the byte stream or application content based on the
   policy specified.  Firewall service functions fall into such a class,
   for example.  In all such instances, servicing involves determining
   whether to permit the traffic to proceed onwards or to deny the
   traffic from proceeding onwards and drop the traffic.  In some cases,
   dropping of the traffic may be accompanied with the generation of a
   response to the originator of traffic or to the destination or both.
   Once the service function determines the result - permit or deny (or
   drop), it simply applies the same result to the residual packets of
   the flow by caching the result in the flow state.

   In essence, the effect of service delivery is a PERMIT or a DENY
   action on the traffic of a flow.  This class of service functions can
   avoid all the overhead of processing such traffic at the SF, by
   simply requesting another entity in the SFP, to assume the function
   of performing the action determined by the service function.  Since
   PERMIT and DENY are very simple actions other entities in the SFP are
   very likely to be able to perform them on behalf of the requesting
   SF.  A service function can thus offload simple functions to other
   entities in the SFP.

   Since SFF is the one steering traffic to the SFs and hence is on the
   SFP, is a natural entity to assume the offload function.  An SF not
   interested in traffic being steered to it can simply perform a simple
   offload by indicating a PERMIT action along with an OFFLOAD request.
   The SFF responsible for steering the traffic to the SF takes note of
   the ACTION and offload request.  The OFFLOAD directive and the ACTION
   received from the requesting SF are cached against the SF for that
   flow.  Once cached, residual packets on the flow are serviced by the
   cached directive and action as if being serviced by the corresponding

   SF.

3.2.1.  Stateful SFF

   SFFs are the closest SFC infrastructure entities to the service
   functions.  SFFs may be state-full and hence can cache the offload
   and action in both of the unidirectional flows of a connection.  As a
   consequence, action and offload become effective on both the flows
   simultaneously and remain so until cancelled or the flow terminates.

   SFFs may not always honor the offload requests received from SFs.
   This does not affect the correctness of the SFP in any way.  It
   implies that the SFs can expect traffic to arrive on a flow, which it
   offloaded, and hence must service them, which may involve requesting
   an offload again.  It is natural to think of an acknowledgement
   mechanism to provide offload guarantees to the SFs but such a
   mechanism just adds to the overhead while not providing significant
   benefit.  Offload serves as a best effort mechanism.

3.2.2.  Packet Re-ordering

   Offload mechanism creates short time-windows where packet re-ordering
   may occur.  While SFs request flows be offloaded to SFFs, packets may
   still be in flight at various points along the SFP, including some
   between the SFF and the SF.  Once the offload decision is received
   and committed into the flow entry at the SFF, any packets arriving
   after and destined to the offloading SF are treated to the offload
   decision and forwarded along (if it is a PERMIT action).  Inflight
   packets to the offloading SF may arrive at the SFF after one or more
   packets are already treated to the offload decision and forwarded
   along.

   This is a transitional effect and may not occur in all cases.  For
   instance, if the decision to offload a flow by an SF is based on the
   first packet of TCP flow, a reasonable time window exists between the
   offload action being committed into the SFF and arrival of subsequent
   packet of the same flow at that SFF.  Likewise, request/response
   based protocols such as HTTP may not always be subject to the re-
   ordering effects.

3.2.3.  Policy Implications

   Offload mechanism may be controlled by the policy layer.  The SFs
   themselves may have a static policy to utilize the capability offered
   by the SFC infrastructure.  They could also be dynamic and controlled
   by the specific policy layer under which the SFs operate.

   Similarly, the SFC infrastructure, specifically the classifiers and



Kumar, et al.             Expires April 4, 2015                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft            SFC SFP Optimization                  Oct 2014


   the SFFs, may be under the SFC infrastructure control plane policy
   controlling the decision to honor offloads from an SF.  This policy
   in turn may be coarse-grain, at the SF level, and hence static.  It
   can also be fine grain and hence dynamic but it adds to the overhead
   of policy distribution.

   Policy model related to offloads is out of scope of this document.

3.2.4.  Capabilities Exchange

   Simple offloads can be exposed and negotiated a priori as a
   capability between the SFFs and the SFs or the corresponding control
   layers.  In the simplest of the implementations, this is provided by
   the SFC infrastructure and the SFs are statically configured to
   utilize them without capabilities negotiation, within the constraints
   of the SF specific policies.

   Capabilities exchange is outside the scope of this document.


4.  Methods For SFP Optimization

   There are a number of different models that may be used to facilitate
   shortest SFP realization.  We present two here.

   The shortest SFP methods discussed in the following sections require
   signaling among the participant components to communicate offload and
   permit/deny actions.  The signaling may be performed in the data-
   plane or in the control plane.

   a.  Data-plane: An SFC specific communication channel is needed for
       SNs to communicate the offload request along with the SF treated
       packet.  [NSH] defines a header specifically for carrying SFP
       along with metadata and provides such a channel for use with
       offloads.  Necessary bits need to be allocated in NSH to convey
       the action as well as the offload directive.  This signaling may
       be limited to SN and SFF or may continue from one SFF to another
       SFF or the classifier.  It may also involve signaling directly
       from the SF to the classifier.

   b.  Control-plane: Messages are required between the SN and the
       service controller as well as between the SFF and the control
       plane.  Service controller messaging is out of scope of this
       document and it is assumed to be service controller specific.

4.1.  Hop-by-hop Offload

   SNs receive traffic on an overlay from the SFF.  SNs service the
   traffic and turn them back to the SFF on an overlay or forward the
   traffic on the underlay.  In the former case, along with returning
   the traffic to SFF, they can perform simple offload by signaling
   OFFLOAD and ACTION to the SFF.  SFF caches the OFFLOAD and ACTION
   while forwarding the serviced packet onwards to the next service hop
   on the SFP or dropping it.  SFF can now enforce the OFFLOAD and
   ACTION on the residual packets of the flow.

   Additionally, SFF may choose to signal the upstream SFFs of the
   OFFLOAD and ACTION received from an SF.  This may continue
   recursively until the first SFF is reached, which is the classifier
   itself.

   By performing such hop-by-hop offloads, SFP can be reduced to an
   optimum one, steering traffic to only those SFs that really need to
   see the traffic.

   Figure 1 to Figure 3 show an example of SF and SFF performing an
   offload operation and the effect thereafter on the SFP.

4.1.1.  Progression Of SFP Optimization

   SFP optimization happens at two levels:

   Level-1:  Collapsing of the SFF-to-SF hops into the SFF or the SFC
             infrastructure.

   Level-2:  Reduction of the (collapsed) SFP within the SFC
             infrastructure to the shortest possible.

   Figure 1 to Figure 3 show one sequence of offload events leading to a
   shorter SFP.  Although not shown in these figures, further offload
   events ultimately lead to an optimum SFP.

   Below steps show one such sequence of offload events that lead to
   such an optimum SFP.

   Stage-1:  Prior to any offloads, service function path SFP1
             (corresponding to SFC1) has the following actual forwarding
             path as shown in Figure 1:
             CF ->
             NF1 -> SFF1 -> SF1 -> SFF1 -> NF1 ->
             NF2 -> SFF2 -> SF2 -> SFF2 -> NF2 ->
             NF3 -> SFF3 -> SF3 -> SFF3 -> NF3 ->

   Stage-2:  After SF2 performs a simple offload, which is signaled to
             upstream SFFs - SFF1, Classifier, SFP1 forwarding path
             changes to the below as shown in Figure 3:
             CF ->
             NF1 -> SFF1 -> SF1 -> SFF1 -> NF1 ->
             NF3 -> SFF3 -> SF3 -> SFF3 -> NF3 ->

   Stage-3:  After SF3 performs simple offload, which is signaled to
             upstream SFFs - SFF2, SFF1, and Classifier, SFP1 forwarding
             path changes to the below (figure not shown) />:
             CF ->
             NF1 -> SFF1 -> SF1 -> SFF1 -> NF1 ->

   Stage-4:  After SF1 performs simple offload, which is signaled to
             upstream SFFs - Classifier, SFP1 forwarding path changes to
             the below (figure not shown):
             CF ->

4.2.  Service Controller Offload

   Each SN signals the service controller of the OFFLOAD and ACTION via
   control plane messaging for a specific flow.  The service controller
   then signals the appropriate SFFs to offload the requested SFs, there
   by achieving the hop-by-hop offload behavior.

   The service controller has full knowledge of all the SFs of the SFP
   offloading the flow and hence can determine the optimum SFP within
   the Service Controller and program the appropriate SFFs to achieve
   SFP optimization.


5.  Offload Data-plane Signaling

   Since Offload and action are signaled at the time of returning the
   traffic to SFF, post servicing the traffic, such signaling can be
   integrated into the service header of the packet.  Figure 4 shows the
   bits necessary to achieve the signaling using the SFC encapsulation
   as described in [I-D.quinn-sfc-nsh].

   F : Offload bit; indicates offload request when F is set to 1
   D : Drop (or Deny) bit, drop when D=1 and permit when D=0;
       Drop bit is valid only when F is set to 1


                   Figure 4: NSH Offload and ACTION Bits

   Although SFs can signal SFFs by piggy backing on the serviced packet,
   SFFs cannot signal in a similar fashion.  This is because the traffic
   is forwarded along the SFP to the next or downstream SFF.  The
   offload signaling has to go to the upstream SFFs, in the opposite
   direction.  SFFs have a choice: perform out-of-band signaling towards
   the upstream SFFs or wait until traffic arrives on the opposite flow
   on the reverse SFP, where SFPs are symmetric.  SFFs can then
   piggyback the offload signaling on the reverse traffic towards the
   upstream SFFs.  The actual method employed to signal offload between
   the SFFs is implementation specific.

8.  Security Considerations

   Security of the offload signaling mechanism is very important.  This
   document does not advocate any additional security mechanisms other
   the data plane and control plane signaling security mechanisms.
