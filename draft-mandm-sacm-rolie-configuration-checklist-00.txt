1.  Introduction

   This document defines an extension to the Resource-Oriented
   Lightweight Information Exchange (ROLIE) protocol
   [I-D.ietf-mile-rolie] to support the publication of configuration
   checklist information.  Many enterprises operate according to
   guidance provided to them by a control framework
   ([CIS_Critical_Controls], [PCI_DSS], [NIST_800-53] etc.), which often
   prescribe that an enterprise define a standard, security-minded
   configuration for each technology they operate.  Such standard
   configurations are often referred to as configuration checklists.
   These configuration checklists contain a set of configuration
   recommendations for a given endpoint.  A configuration recommendation
   prescribes expected values pertaining to one or more discrete
   endpoint attributes.

2.  Terminology

   Configuration Checklist A configuration checklist is an organized
   collection of rules about a particular kind of system or platform.

   Configuration Item  Generally synonymous with endpoint attribute.

Internet-Draft                rolie-cc-ext                     June 2017


   Configuration Recommendation A configuration recommendation is an
   expression of the desired posture of one or more configuration items.
   A configuration recommendation generally includes the description of
   the recommendation, a rationale statement, and the expected state of
   collected posture information.

   TODO: Others??  TBD

   TODO: There needs to be a "normative" reference to the SCAP 1.2/3
   specifications and schema definitions

3.  New information-types

   This document defines a new "information-type" value of
   "configuration-checklist".

3.1.  The "configuration-checklist" information-type

   The "configuration-checklist" information type represents a body of
   information describing a set of configuration recommendations.  A
   configuration recommendation is, minimally, a single configuration
   item paired with a recommended value or range of values.  Depending
   on the source, a configuration recommendation may carry with it
   additional information (i.e. description, references, rationale,
   etc.).  Provided below is a non-exhaustive list of information that
   may be considered as components of a configuration checklist.

   o  A "Data Stream":

   o  A "Benchmark"

   o  A "Profile"

   o  A "Value"

   o  A "Rule" or "Group" of Rules

      *  Description

      *  Rationale

      *  Remediation Instructions

      *  Information, described in the dialect of a supported "check
         system", indicating the method(s) used to audit the checklist
         configuration item.

   o  Applicable Platform Information

Internet-Draft                rolie-cc-ext                     June 2017


   o  Information regarding a set of patches to be evaluated

   o  Any supported "tailoring" information, providing a method for
      evaluating entities to refine the recommendations in the data
      stream without modifying the published data stream content.  (WKM
      NOTE: Does "tailoring" need to be here?  Why would any tailoring
      be included in a published feed?  Unless the organization is re-
      publishing the content with their tailoring included.)

4.  Usage of Configuration Checklist Information in the Atom Publishing
    Protocol

   These requirements apply when a ROLIE repository contains any
   Collections, who's href points to an atom:feed who's atom:category
   element contains a scheme attribute of
   "urn:ietf:params:rolie:category:information-type" and a term
   attribute of the new "configuration-checklist" information-type.

   <atom:category
     scheme="urn:ietf:params:rolie:category:information-type"
     term="configuration-checklist">...</atom:category>

5.  Requirements for the 'atom:entry' Element

   The following sections describe the various requirements for the
   "atom:entry" element, and it's child elements, when publishing
   configuration checklist information to a ROLIE repository.

5.1.  The 'atom:content' Element

   Information about the proposed serialization types for configuration
   checklists

   o  PDF

   o  Text

   o  Word

   o  Excel

   o  XML via DSC

   o  JSON?

5.2.  The 'rolie:format' Element

   A configuration checklist may be published by an organization using
   numerous formats, such as PDF, Word or Excel documents, and
   automation content using XML or JSON data models.

   This document does not specify any additional requirements for use of
   the rolie:format element.

5.3.  Configuration checklist metadata included in the 'rolie:property'
      Element

   A breadth of metadata may be included with a configuration checklist
   as identifying information.  A publishing organization may wish to
   recognize or attribute checklist authors or contributors, or maintain
   a revision/version history over time.  Other metadata that may be
   included could indicate the various categories of products to which
   the checklist applies, such as Operating System, Network Device, or
   Application Server.

   The following list describes various 'rolie:property' constructs.

   o  author (0..n)

      *  An unbounded number of "rolie:property" elements with a "name"
         attribute of "author" may be included to indicate those
         individuals noted as the authors of the configuration
         checklist.

   o  contributor (0..n)

      *  An unbounded number of "rolie:property" elements with a "name"
         attribute of "contributor" may be included to indicate those
         individuals noted as recognized contributors to the
         configuration checklist and/or the recommendations contained
         within.

   o  checklist version: The "value" of the "checklist version" property
      indicates the version number of the configuration checklist, such
      as "3.1.1"

   o  title: The "value" of the "title" property indicates the document
      title of the configuration checklist, such as "CIS Benchmark for
      Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2"

   o  publication date

   o  overview

   want more than one target-platform and more than one profile.

6.  IANA Considerations

   Per this document, IANA has added an entry to the "ROLIE Security
   Resource Information Type Sub-Registry" registry located at
   https://www.iana.org/assignments/rolie/category/information-type.

   New IANA table for "ROLIE Entry Format"

   o  scap-1.2

   o  PDF

   o  xccdf-1.2-collection

   o  oval

   o  cvrf

   o  cve (should we reuse the enumref?); Look at the "enumref" and see
      if we can copy/paste configuration checklist-specific information
      in a similar manner?  Can we then include that enum reference in
      the ROLIE extension document or should we create a new "enumref"
      document separately?

   o  vulnerability

   name:  configuration-checklist

   index:  TBD

   reference:  TBD
