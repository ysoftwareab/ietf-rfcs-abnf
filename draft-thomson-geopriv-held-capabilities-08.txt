 Device Capability Negotiation for Device-Based Location Determination
                   and Location Measurements in HELD
               draft-thomson-geopriv-held-capabilities-08

Abstract

   A Device is a valuable source of information about its location.  A
   Location Information Server (LIS) that serves a location URI about a
   Device is unable to acquire this information.  Extensions to HTTP-
   Enabled Location Delivery (HELD) are described for negotiating and
   exercising Device capabilities for location determination or location
   measurement collection.

Internet-Draft              HELD Capabilities                  June 2010


1.  Introduction

   A Device is a good source of information about its location.  Even
   where a Device is unable to independently determine its location, it
   can often make observations about its environment and network
   attachment that are of use in determining its position.  Making this
   information available to the Location Information Server (LIS) in the
   access network can improve the quality of location estimates for the
   Device.

   Requests that retrieve location information by value can benefit from
   Device-provided measurement data, as described in
   [I-D.thomson-geopriv-held-measurements].  However, location
   information provided through location URIs [RFC5808] cannot
   effectively use this information.  The LIS that serves the URI is
   unable to contact the Device to acquire information.

   Access to some form of location determination is a necessary
   precondition of providing a location URI.  The LIS that serves that
   location URI is assumed to be capable of determining the location of
   the Device.  A LIS might only have a limited capacity for determining
   location in serving a location URI.  The quality and timeliness of
   responses can be improved with Device assistance.

   Acquiring location measurements or information from a Device is made
   difficult by the nature of the relationship between the LIS, or
   access network, and the Device.  The relationship between a LIS and
   the Devices that it serves is often transient.  A Device is not
   necessarily a permanent part of an access network, so it is not
   possible to pre-arrange trust relationships between Device and LIS.

   HELD [I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery] provides a basis for
   the relationship between Device and LIS.  LIS Discovery
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-lis-discovery] provides a means for the Device to
   initiate the relationship.  This document extends the basic HELD
   location request to include negotiation of a mechanism that allows
   the LIS to request information from the Device.

   Location-related Device capabilities include the ability to generate
   or acquire location information, or the ability to make observations
   about the mode of network attachment or environment.  For instance, a
   Device with Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) hardware can
   determine its own position by taking a set of measurements and
   performing a calculation, or it can provide GNSS measurement data.

   This document describes how a Device can advertise its ability to
   locate itself or provide location-related measurement data to a LIS.
   This advertisement is made in a HELD location request where the

Internet-Draft              HELD Capabilities                  June 2010


   Device acquires a location URI (see
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery]).  The LIS is then able to
   exercise advertised capabilities to acquire location-related
   measurement data or location information from the Device when serving
   the location URI.


2.  Conventions used in this document

   This document relies on definitions from [I-D.ietf-geopriv-arch].
   Use of the terms LIS and Device is consistent with
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery].  Location-related
   measurement data (and location measurement) is defined in
   [I-D.thomson-geopriv-held-measurements] and location estimate is
   defined in [I-D.thomson-geopriv-uncertainty].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Capabilities Exchange Overview

   A Device provides the LIS with a capabilities advertisement when it
   requests a location URI.  A Device can advertise the ability to
   acquire location-related measurement data of any type (see
   [I-D.thomson-geopriv-held-measurements]), or the ability to
   autonomously determine its own location.

   The LIS responds with a capabilities agreement, that includes which
   of these capabilities it might use.  As part of the agreement, the
   LIS identifies an HTTP resource (the invocation resource) that it
   will use to request Device assistance.  The Device monitors this
   resource as long as it is willing to provide the advertised data.

   In the process of serving requests to a location URI, a LIS might
   determine that certain Device capabilities could be useful or
   necessary in completing the request.  The LIS alters the invocation
   resource to include a request that details what data is desired.  The
   Device acquires the updated resource and provides the requested
   information.

   Figure 1 shows a logical overview of a simple scenario where the LIS
   uses a Device-provided measurement to service a request to a location
   URI.

   In practice, this scheme relies on HTTP polling to provide a channel
   for capability invocation.  This mechanism is described in more
   detail in Section 5.

3.1.  Capabilities Exchange

   To indicate capabilities to a LIS, a Device advertises its location
   determination or measurement capabilities to the LIS in a HELD
   "locationRequest" message.  The LIS selects those capabilities that
   it might make use of and provides a capabilities agreement that
   includes the selected capabilities in the "locationResponse" message,
   along with the location URI.

                      Figure 2: Capabilities Exchange

   Once a common set of capabilities are agreed upon, the LIS is able
   invoke these capabilities to assist in the generation of location
   information.  Agreed capabilities and associated parameters are
   stored in association with the contextual information necessary for
   serving the location URI.

3.2.  Capabilities Invocation

   The LIS invokes capabilities as it is necessary to service requests
   to the location URIs it provides.

                      Figure 3: Invoking Capabilities

   Capabilities are bound to the location URIs that are provided in the
   response that indicates the mutually agreed capabilities.  The LIS
   MUST NOT use capabilities for any purpose other than serving those

Internet-Draft              HELD Capabilities                  June 2010


   location URIs.

   The set of capabilities associated with a location URI is fixed.  A
   Device instead applies local policy in determining whether to respond
   to a capability invocation.  A Device can choose to discontinue
   selected capabilities by refusing to respond to a capability
   invocation.  A Device can also cease to monitor the resource used for
   capability invocation to terminate all capabilities.


4.  The Capability Exchange

   A capabilities exchange is initiated with a location request from a
   Device.  The Device includes a capbilities advertisement in the
   location request.  The LIS responds with agreed capabilities in the
   location response.

4.1.  Capabilities Advertisement

   A Device capabilities advertisement (the "deviceCapabilities"
   element) is added to the HELD location request by the Device.  This
   element can contain a "location" element to indicate that the Device
   is capable of determining its own location autonomously; it can also
   contain one or more "measurement" elements, each indicating that the
   Device is cable of providing location measurement data.

   Each capability is uniquely identified with a "id" attribute.

   A "responseTime" attribute indicates the expected time that acquiring
   the location or measurement data takes, in milliseconds.  The
   advertised response time assists the LIS in deciding whether or not
   to invoke a capability when serving a request for location
   information.

      The Device is only able to quantify the time for its own
      involvement in the process; additional delays from polling,
      network transit and LIS processing need to be included in any
      decision to invoke a Device capability.

   Location measurement capabilities include a "type" attribute, which
   identifies the type of measurement.  Types are identified using the
   qualified name of the XML element for the measurement, as with the
   "measurementRequest" element defined in
   [I-D.thomson-geopriv-held-measurements].

   Each capability element can also contain arbitrary content that
   carries supplementary information specific to the capability.  This
   supplementary information includes, but is not restricted to,



Thomson, et al.          Expires January 1, 2011                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft              HELD Capabilities                  June 2010


   measurement parameters that identify specific aspects of a
   measurement capability.  Different supplementary information can be
   provided by the Device and LIS.

   The following figure shows a capabilities advertisement that might be
   made by a Device with GNSS capabilities.  This includes both
   autonomous GNSS location determination capability as well as GNSS
   measurement capability with additional parameters.

     <deviceCapabilities
         xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:cap">
       <location id="loc" responseTime="45000"/>
       <measurement xmlns:g="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:lm:gnss"
                    type="g:gnss" id="gps" responseTime="12000">
         <g:gnss system="gps" signal="L1"/>
       </measurement>
     </deviceCapabilities>

4.2.  Capabilities Agreement

   A capabilities agreement ("agreedCapabilities" element) is included
   in the HELD location response.  This element contains a subset of the
   advertised capabilities, indicating which capabilities the LIS wishes
   to use.  Capabilities are identified using the "id" attribute, but
   other attributes are omitted.

   A capabilities agreement contains an HTTP URI for an invocation
   resource.  The "monitor" element indicates a resource that the Device
   is requested to monitor for capability invocations (Section 5).

   The following figure shows a capabilities agreement that might be
   made in response to a device capabilities advertisement.  This
   includes an invoke resource and a reference to each device
   capability, using the "id" attribute for each location and
   measurement capability.

     <agreedCapabilities
         xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:cap">
       <monitor>https://lis.example.com/inv/C90dXBsZT4KPC</monitor>
       <location id="loc"/>
       <measurement id="gps"/>
     </agreedCapabilities>


5.  Capability Invocation

   The LIS includes a URI for an HTTP "invocation" resource in the
   capabilities agreement.  A Device that wishes to provide advertised



Thomson, et al.          Expires January 1, 2011                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft              HELD Capabilities                  June 2010


   capabilities monitors this resource.

   The contents of the invocation resource identify the information that
   the LIS desires.  The LIS updates the invocation resource when a
   request to a location URI is made that could benefit from location or
   measurement data acquired by the Device.

   The invocation resource is updated to identify one or more
   capabilities when information is requested by the LIS.  For each
   capability, the resource includes a destination URI for the requested
   data, and a time.  By monitoring the invocation resource, the Device
   is informed when the LIS requires more information and the Device is
   then able to provide that information.

5.1.  HTTP Polling

   The Device monitors the invocation resource, using either HTTP long-
   polling [I-D.loreto-http-bidirectional] or periodic requests (short-
   polling).  Both methods use the HTTP GET method.  Client and server
   developers are reminded that full support of HTTP [RFC2616]
   facilities is expected.

   The Device SHOULD retrieve an initial representation of the resource
   and poll for updates using conditional request headers, such as
   "If-Modified-Since" or "If-None-Match".  The Device SHOULD use long-
   polling and indicate this using a Timeout header
   [I-D.loreto-http-timeout] [[...or whatever replaces this, since
   Timeout is already taken]].  An HTTP 200 (OK) response is sent
   immediately when the resource is updated, or an HTTP 304 (Not
   Modified) response is sent if the timeout period lapses .  In order
   to continue monitoring the state of the resource, the Device
   immediately sends another request upon receiving a response.

   In the absence of the Timeout header, the server MAY assume that
   short-polling is in use.  If short-polling is used, the Device MUST
   NOT continuously poll for updates.  The server can limit the rate
   that a client is able to poll by sending a 503 (Service Unavailable)
   response with an appropriate "Retry-After" header.  A client that
   receives this header MUST adjust its polling rate to match the
   indicated period.

5.2.  Invocation Resource

   The resource that the Device monitors identifies individual
   capabilities and when the information that they provide is requested.

   The value of the invocation resource determines what information is
   required.  This document is an XML document with the MIME type of



Thomson, et al.          Expires January 1, 2011                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft              HELD Capabilities                  June 2010


   "application/held+xml" and a document element of "invokeCapability".
   Initially, this document is likely to be empty.

   A Device monitors the invocation resource for changes.  A change in
   the state of the invocation resource indicates that the LIS requests
   some data.  The value of the invocation resource indicates the
   capability, where the data associated with the capability is to be
   pushed by the Device, and when the associated data is to be provided.

   For instance, if the LIS wants to invoke the location capability of
   the Device, it updates the resource to produce the following
   representation:

     <invokeCapabilities
         xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:cap">
       <measurement id="gps" before="2011-07-09T13:55:01+10:00">
         <push>https://lis.example.com/push/U2Nob29sIGlzIGNvb2wu</push>
       </measurement>
     </invokeCapabilities>

   The Device monitors the invocation resource as long as it is willing
   to respond to capability invocation requests, though it MAY suspend
   any monitoring while it responds to a request for data.  Upon expiry
   of the location URI, the Device SHOULD stop monitoring the resource.
   An HTTP 404 (Not Found) or 410 (Gone) response can be provided to
   indicate to the Device that the resource no longer exists.

5.3.  Invocation Time

   The "before" attribute on the capability invocation serves to advise
   the Device on the latest time when a response is desired.  This time
   is the latest moment that information from the Device is of use to
   the LIS.  If this time has passed, or the requested information
   cannot be provided before this time, then the capability invocation
   can be ignored.

   The "periodic" attribute on a capability requests periodic updates.
   The attribute contains a time interval in milliseconds, which
   specifies the periodicity desired.  This indicates that the Device
   provide information before the time specified in the "before"
   attribute and periodically thereafter at the specified interval.

   Periodic invocations continue until the invocation is modified or
   removed.  The Device SHOULD continue to monitor the invocation
   resource to be informed of any changes.

Internet-Draft              HELD Capabilities                  June 2010


   For instance, the following invocation contains a request to provide
   measurements for the capability identified with the "id" attribute of
   "gps".  This information should be provided before
   "2011-07-09T13:55:01+10:00" and at 60 second intervals thereafter
   (before 13:55:01, then before 13:56:01, then 13:57:01, and so on).

     <invokeCapabilities
         xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:cap">
       <measurement id="gps" before="2011-07-09T13:55:01+10:00"
                    periodic="60000">
         <push>https://lis.example.com/push/U2Nob29sIGlzIGNvb2wu</push>
       </measurement>
     </invokeCapabilities>

   The following figure shows that a Device acquires measurement data
   immediately upon receiving a capability invocation with a periodic
   interval.  After these measurements are pushed to the LIS, the Device
   waits for a period.  The time that is waited is the difference
   between the periodic interval (p) and the expected time to acquire
   measurement data (m).  This ensures that measurement data is provided
   to the LIS prior to the requested time.

5.4.  Responding to a Capability Invocation

   A Device that wishes to provide information SHOULD do so when it
   receives an invocation that it can comply with.  Any information is
   pushed to the URI indicated in the "push" element as an HTTP PUT.
   The format of the information provided depends on the capability.

   A Device can choose to ignore a capability invocation at any time.

   Information provided in this manner can be considered as additional
   supplementary information that is provided for the purposes of
   serving the location URI.  The same authorization rules that apply to
   the location URI apply to this data.  A LIS is able to redistribute
   this information and any results based on this information under the
   same policy that the location URI operates.  Any information MUST
   only be used as permitted by the Device.  Explicit data expiration
   indications, such as that used in
   [I-D.thomson-geopriv-held-measurements], MUST be respected.

Internet-Draft              HELD Capabilities                  June 2010


5.5.  Error Reponse to an Invocation

   A Device might be unable to acquire the requested location or
   measurement information when it is requested.  In this case, a HELD
   error message is sent to the resource indicated in the "push" element
   of the invocation, in place of the requested data.  The HELD error
   message is defined in Section 5.3 of
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery].

   Requests for location information can elicit a push containing any of
   the applicable HELD error codes (including "locationUnknown").
   Requests for measurement data can result in the same set of codes,
   plus a newly defined error code: "noMeasurement" is defined in
   Section 10.1.

5.6.  Multiple Invocations

   The same invoke resource is used for multiple capabilities.  Devices
   that support multiple capabililties identify the capability that the
   LIS desires to use through the "id" attribute on the capability.  If
   multiple capabilities are invoked at the same time, the Device MAY
   choose to provide all information concurrently or separately, and in
   whole, in part or not at all.

   The measurement capability inherently supports provision of multiple
   measurements concurrently.  A single measurement container can be
   provided with multiple different forms of measurement.  Measurement
   and location capabilities are pushed separately.

   A LIS MUST provide a different push resource for each separate
   capability that it invokes.  Without this, information from the
   Device cannot be reliably correlated with a specific capability.  For
   instance, an error response for one capability might be
   misinterpreted as an error for all capabilities.


6.  The Location Capability

   The location capability indicates that the Device can determine its
   own location.  This is represented by the inclusion of a "location"
   element.

   The ability to locate itself is a trait that is applicable to Devices
   in a range of networks.  This includes automated location
   determination, like Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), user
   input, an alternative location service, or a range of location
   techniques.




Thomson, et al.          Expires January 1, 2011               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft              HELD Capabilities                  June 2010


6.1.  Parameters

   The "location" element MAY include a "locationType" element that
   includes a value of "civic" or "geodetic", a space-separated list
   containing both values, or the value "any".  A basic description of
   the semantics of location type is included in Section 6.3 of HELD
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery].

   When included in the capabilities advertisement, the "locationType"
   element indicates the type of location information that the device is
   capable of providing.  When included in other messages, the
   "locationType" element indicates the type of location information
   that the LIS requests that the Device provide.  Omitting the
   "locationType" element indicates that the previous value from the
   most recent message is requested; if there is no such value, then any
   form of location information is acceptable.

6.2.  Invocation

   When invoked, the Device provides location information in the form of
   a PIDF-LO.  The Device uses an HTTP PUT to the URI identified in the
   "push" element of the capability invocation.  The PUT request
   includes a PIDF-LO document and a "Content-Type" of
   "application/pidf+xml".

   Only the "location-info" element of the PIDF-LO is used by the LIS;
   other PIDF-LO fields SHOULD be minimally populated by the Device.  It
   is RECOMMENDED that the Device generate an unlinked pseudonym for the
   "entity" attribute of the presence document to avoid providing
   identity information.

   In providing location information in this manner, the Device
   implicitly grants the LIS the ability to redistribute location
   information under the same conditions that apply to the location URI
   that the capability was negotiated with.


7.  Location Measurement Capability

   The location capability indicates that the Device can acquire
   location-related measurement data of a specified type.  This is
   represented by the inclusion of a "measurement" element.

   Measurement data from the Device can be invaluable in improving the
   quality of location information.  Measurement information from a
   Device can improve the accuracy of location estimates or enable
   positioning methods that would not otherwise be available.  See
   [I-D.thomson-geopriv-held-measurements] for more information on



Thomson, et al.          Expires January 1, 2011               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft              HELD Capabilities                  June 2010


   location measurements.  Providing access to measurement data by using
   the capability exchange makes these advantages available when a
   location recipient uses a location URI to retrieve location
   information.

7.1.  Parameters

   A capability advertisement for location measurements includes the
   type of measurement that is supported, using the "type" attribute of
   the "measurement" element.  Measurement types are identified using
   the XML qualified name of the measurement element, as defined for the
   measurement request in [I-D.thomson-geopriv-held-measurements].

   The "type" attribute is omitted from the capabilities agreement and
   capability invocation.  If the LIS supports or requires a subset of
   the measurement data, it MAY indicate this using measurement
   parameters in the agreement or the capability invocation.  Omission
   of parameters in either message indicates that the last set
   parameters are to be applied.  For instance, if parameters are
   included in the capabilities advertisement and revised in the
   capabilities agreement, a capability invocation can omit these and
   have the parameters from the agreement applied.

   A capability invocation MAY include a "samples" parameter to request
   that the Device provide a certain number of samples of the indicated
   measurement type.  The "samples" parameter defaults to 1.

   The Device MAY ignore this parameter and provide a smaller (or
   larger) number of samples.  However, a Device SHOULD indicate how
   many samples were acquired for a given measurement type, either by
   including multiple measurements, by providing multiple separate
   responses, or by setting the "samples" attribute for elements of the
   measurement where available.

7.2.  Invocation

   The Device acquires and pushes location measurements to the
   identified URI when a measurement capability is invoked.  The Device
   uses an HTTP PUT to the URI identified in the "target" element of the
   capability indication.  This document contains the MIME type
   "application/held+xml" and has a document element of "measurements".
   This document contains one or more measurement elements containing
   the requested measurement data.

   Multiple measurements can be provided at the same time.  The
   "measurements" element simply contains multiple measurement elements.
   This can be used to simultaneously provide information for multiple
   different invocations of this capability.  Measurements that are

   acquired at different times are provided in different requests.


8.  Example Capabilities Exchange and Invocation

   This section shows sample messages relating to a location request
   with capabilities, monitoring the invocation resource and the
   provision of measurement or location information.  HTTP headers are
   shown on messages where it is relevant to do so.

   The following HELD request from a Device includes a capabilities
   advertisement; HTTP headers are omitted:

     <held:locationRequest
         xmlns:held="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held">
       <held:locationType exact="true">locationURI</held:locationType>
       <requestPolicyUri
           xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:policy"/>

       <cap:deviceCapabilities
           xmlns:cap="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:cap">
         <cap:location id="loc" responseTime="45000">
           <held:locationType>geodetic</held:locationType>
         </cap:location>
         <cap:measurement
             xmlns:gnss="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:lm:gnss"
             type="gnss:gnss" id="gps" responseTime="12000">
           <gnss:gnss system="gps" signal="L1"/>
         </cap:measurement>
       </cap:deviceCapabilities>
     </held:locationRequest>

   Two capabilities are included: location and measurement.  The
   measurement capability indicates that GNSS measurements can be
   provided by the Device.  The GNSS capability indicates that
   measurement for the GPS L1 signal are the only GNSS measurement
   supported.

   The LIS response includes location URIs, along with a capabilities
   agreement:

     <held:locationResponse
         xmlns:held="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held">
       <held:locationUriSet expires="2011-07-11T15:06:00+10:00">
         <held:locationURI>
           https://lis.example.com/OnBhcmFtczp4bWw6bnM6c
         </held:locationURI>
       </held:locationUriSet>

       <cap:agreedCapabilities
           xmlns:cap="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:cap">
         <cap:monitor>
           https://lis.example.com/inv/OnBhcmFtczp4C90dXBsZT4KPC
         </cap:monitor>
         <cap:location id="loc"/>
         <cap:measurement id="gps"/>
       </cap:agreedCapabilities>
     </held:locationResponse>

   This indication instructs the Device to monitor a URI to determine
   when the LIS wants to invoke either capability.

   The Device then monitors the state of the resource:

   GET /inv/OnBhcmFtczp4C90dXBsZT4KPC HTTP/1.1
   Host: lis.example.com


   The resource initially contains no invocation instructions:

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK

Internet-Draft              HELD Capabilities                  June 2010


   The Device then issues a long-polling request to monitor the state of
   the resource:

   GET /inv/OnBhcmFtczp4C90dXBsZT4KPC HTTP/1.1
   Host: lis.example.com
   If-None-Match: "xyzzy"
   Timeout: 600


   Some time later, the LIS receives a location request and decides that
   the GNSS measurement capability of the Device would be useful or
   necessary in completing the reqeust.  The LIS updates the invocation
   resource with instructions to the Device to provide location
   measurements:

   The Device decides that it is able to provide these data.  It takes
   the requested measurement and pushes the measurement data to the
   indicated destination:

   PUT /push/U2Nob29sIGlzIGNvb2wu HTTP/1.1

         <cn0>48</cn0>
       </sat>
     </gnss>
   </measurements>

   The LIS immediately provides an empty response to the Device:

   HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
   Server: Example LIS
   Date: Sat, 9 Jul 2011 03:54:58 GMT


   The LIS is then able to use the provided measurement data to provide
   highly accurate location information in response to the request it
   received.


9.  Security Considerations

   Use of location or measurement capabilities has privacy
   considerations (Section 9.1).  Protecting privacy depends on the
   secrecy of the URIs used (Section 9.2).  Use of Device capability



Thomson, et al.          Expires January 1, 2011               [Page 19]

Internet-Draft              HELD Capabilities                  June 2010


   also exposes a LIS to the possibility of a Device that falsifies
   location or measurement data (Section 9.3).

9.1.  Privacy Considerations

   The information provided by a Device in the course of responding to a
   capabilities invocation privacy-sensitive data.  This is either
   location information, or measurement data that could be use to
   produce location information.  The GEOPRIV architecture
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-arch] provides a framework for the handling of
   location and location-related information.

   Information about the capabilities of a Device might be privacy
   sensitive.  Similarly, willingness to provide capabilities might be
   sensitive.

   HTTP over TLS [RFC2818] MUST be used to provide confidentiality for
   Device capabilities and the location or measurement data that is
   provided by the Device.

   All data acquired by the LIS in relation to a location URI MUST only
   be used for the purpose of serving the location URI.  Any access
   control policy - such as that installed using
   [I-D.barnes-geopriv-policy-uri] - that applies to the location URI
   also applies to any information acquired using Device capabilities.

   Any information that is provided to the LIS by the Device increases
   the impact of LIS impersonation.  Measures that aim to prevent
   impersonation, as outlined in [I-D.ietf-geopriv-lis-discovery], MUST
   be applied if a Device provides capability information to a LIS.
   These measures include server authentication
   [I-D.saintandre-tls-server-id-check] for all stages of the process.

   Server authentication MUST be used for the HELD location request
   containing the capability exchange, for retrieving the capabilities
   invocation and for publishing any requested information.  Resources
   that are identified by the LIS do no need to be provided by the same
   server identity, but each resource MUST be authenticated based on the
   domain name in the URI.  HTTP over TLS [RFC2818] is strongly
   RECOMMENDED for each of these exchanges.

9.2.  URI Secrecy

   Using capabilities offers attackers a means to provide invalid
   location or measurement data.  The URI offered by the LIS for
   receiving location or measurement data is not protected by an access
   policy.  Knowledge of this URI is all that is required to provide
   information.  If an attacker is able to learn this URI, they could

Internet-Draft              HELD Capabilities                  June 2010


   provide misleading information that could be used by the LIS.

   The only protection provided is secrecy.  Only the Device is given
   the URI to the invocation resource, which is where the URI used for
   providing information is made available.  To guarantee this secrecy,
   the URI of the invocation resource and any URIs contained therein
   need to be difficult to acquire or guess.

   The LIS MUST use confidentiality protection on the channel it uses to
   provide all resources used in the capability exchange and subsequent
   requests: the LIS URI used for the location request, the invocation
   resource, and the resource that location or measurement data is
   pushed to.  HTTP over TLS [RFC2818] MUST be used unless
   confidentiality can be guaranteed by other means.

   To lower the probability of these URIs being discovered by guessing
   or inference, these URIs MUST include sufficient randomness.  The LIS
   SHOULD also periodically change the URIs it provides to limit any
   exposure in the case that these URIs become known to an attacker.

9.3.  Location Veracity

   The LIS is responsible for the veracity of location information it
   provides, especially when serving a location URI.  Information
   acquired from a location URI is attributed to the LIS, unless there
   is an explicit indication as to the provenance of the data.

   A Device might exploit this by spoofing location or measurement data.
   A Device thereby falsely gains any credibility that recipients of
   that data might attribute to the LIS.

   This and other related considerations described in
   [I-D.thomson-geopriv-held-measurements] apply to the use of Device-
   provided information.  At a minimum, a LIS SHOULD mark location
   tuples with the "source" element.


10.  IANA Considerations

   This section registers a URN for a HELD capabilities XML namespace
   (Section 10.2) and a corresponding schema (Section 10.3).

10.1.  Registration of HELD 'noMeasurement' Error Code

   This section registers the "noMeasurement" error code in the "Geopriv
   HELD Registries, Error codes for HELD" IANA registry.

   noMeasurement  This error code indicates that all requested location-
      related measurement data could not be acquired by the Device.

10.2.  URN Sub-Namespace Registration for
       urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:held:cap

   This section registers a new XML namespace,
   "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:held:cap", as per the guidelines in
   [RFC3688].

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:held:cap
