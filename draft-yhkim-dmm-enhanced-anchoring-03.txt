1.  Introduction

   This document aims to identify what should be enhanced for mobility
   anchoring and to provide solution approaches for the enhanced
   mobility anchoring over deployment models presented in [draft-sijeon-
   dmm-deployment-models].

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL","SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document focuses on enhanced mobility anchoring based on the
   functional deployment models presented in [draft-sijeon-dmm-
   deployment-models], which describes deployment models with mobility
   management functions in [RFC7429].

   Anchoring Function (AF) is defined as a combined control-plane and
   data-plane functions.  For the control-plane function, it allocates
   an IP address, i.e., Home Address (HoA), or prefix, i.e., Home
   Network Prefix (HNP) a mobile node, topologically anchored by the
   advertising node.  That is, the anchor node is able to advertise a
   connected route into the routing infrastructure for the allocated IP
   prefixes.  It also takes a data-plane anchor point where packets
   destined to the IP address or IP prefix allocated by the anchor
   should pass through.

   It can be deployed in a decoupled way, i.e. separated control plane
   and data plane.  In that case, following two terms - AF Control Plane
   (AF-CP) and AF Data Plane (AF-DP) - are used.  AF-CP is responsible
   of allocating the IP address and advertising a connected route for an
   associated terminal while AF-DP is responsible of anchoring received
   data packets destined to the IP address allocated by the anchor.

   Internetwork Location Management (LM) is a control-plane function,
   which manages and keeps track of the internetwork location of an MN.
   The location information may be a binding of the advertised IP
   address/prefix, e.g., HoA or HNP, to the IP routing address of the
   MN, or it may be a binding of a node that can forward packets
   destined to the MN.

   Note that the LM could belong to the AF-CP, as it is done in several
   solutions, i.e. Mobile IP (MIP) and Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6).
   However, in this draft, each function is indicated distinctively, as
   those functions could be deployed in different locations to allow
   advanced control and smooth evolution for DMM.

   Forwarding Management (FM) function performs packet interception and
   forwarding to/from the IP address/prefix assigned to the MN, based on
   the internetwork location information, either to the destination or
   to some other network element that knows how to forward the packets
   to their destination.

   Following the FM definition in [RFC7429], it may be split into the
   control plane (FM-CP) and data plane (FM-DP).

3.  Enhanced Mobility Anchoring

   We present enhanced mobility anchoring operations based on the three
   deployment models presented in [I-D.sijeon-dmm-deployment-models].
   For the details of the deployment models, check following draft
   [I-D.sijeon-dmm-deployment-models].

   Figure 1.  Distributed AM, LM, and FM functions (with centralized LM)

   Fig. 1 shows AF is distributed with LM and FM at edge mobility
   routers.  The AF allocates an IP address or IP prefix and advertises
   a connected route of the mobile terminal configured with the
   allocated IP address or IP prefix, when the terminal is attached at a
   mobility router.  It takes a role of intercepting packets destined to
   the allocated IP address/prefix of the mobile terminal.

   The deployment model in Fig. 2 shows that AF-DP is distributed with
   LM and FM into deployed mobility routers while AF-CP is centralized
   in a single entity.  Allocating an IP address/prefix is provided by
   AF-CP, while packet interception is supported by AF-DP.  As the
   control plane and data plane of AF is separated, flexible AF-DP
   selection can be enabled for load balancing or network management, as
   an enhanced mobility anchoring aspect.  Based on the separated AF-CP
   and AF-DP architecture, switching of AF-DP can be supported under the
   control of AF-CP.

   Figure 3.  Distributed AF-DP and FM-DP with centralized AF-CP, LM,
   and FM-CP

   In the function deployment model shown in Fig. 3, separation of FM-CP
   and FM-DP is implemented with the separation of AF-CP and AF-DP.  The
   LM is located at the central entity.  Comparing deployment models
   described in Fig. 3 and Fig. 2, this deployment model facilitates
   management and optimization of forwarding path, even in the mid-
   session, between the AF-DP of an allocated IP address and a current
   serving router where the terminal is attached.  Moreover, it enables
   supporting a flexible selection of forwarding data path well as
   supporting a flexible AF-DP selection by AF-CP.
