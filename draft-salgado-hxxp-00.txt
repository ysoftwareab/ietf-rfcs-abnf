                         draft-salgado-hxxp-00

Abstract

   This document describes the "hxxp" URI scheme, which is widely used
   by the security community to obfuscate an http or https URI to avoid
   being accidentaly interpreted and loaded by a web browser or any user
   agent.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes the "hxxp" URI scheme, which is widely used
   by the security community to obfuscate an http or https URI to avoid
   being accidentaly interpreted an loaded by a web browser or an
   embedded user agent.  This scheme is used in case the resource is
   dangerous and there is security risks on being loaded by an
   application.

   The purpose of this registration is to document its use, block any
   registration of this scheme in the future, explicitly recommend to
   web application developers to never act with this URI scheme in any
   way, and provide a safe method for the security community to share
   malicious information.  This scheme MUST NOT be treated as an http or
   https scheme and MUST NOT be identified as a web resource.  Its
   consumption is only for humans and documentation, and should be
   handled with caution by security professionals.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft            The "hxxp" URI Scheme                 May 2017


   The "hxxp" URI syntactically conforms to the <hxxp-uri> rule below,
   expressed using the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234]:


        hxxp-uri = "hxxp:" hxxp-token [ hxxp-query ] [ hxxp-fragment ]
        hxxp-token = *pchar
        hxxp-query = "?" query
        hxxp-fragment = "#" fragment
        pchar     = <as specified in RFC 3986, Appendix A>
        query     = <as specified in RFC 3986, Appendix A>
        fragment  = <as specified in RFC 3986, Appendix A>


2.2.  URI Scheme Semantics

   The resource that is referenced by a particular "hxxp" URI is NOT
   meant to be interpreted or parsed in any way for applications or any
   automated means.  The resource MUST be interpreted and consumed by
   human security professionals.

2.3.  Encoding Considerations

   "hxxp" URIs are subject to encoding rules as defined in RFC 3986
   [RFC3986].

3.  Acknowledgements

   This document was made by his author in its entirety, so there're no
   acknowledgements yet.

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  URI Scheme Registration

   The "hxxp" URI scheme has been registered in the "Permanent URI
   Schemes" registry.  The information below is provided according to
   the guidelines from RFC 7595 [RFC7595]:

   URI scheme name: hxxp

   Status: Permanent

   Applications/protocols that use the scheme: "hxxp" URIs are forbidden
   to be used by applications.

   IETF)

   References: See Section 6 of this document.

5.  Security Considerations

   As stated in the Introduction, the "hxxp" scheme is forbidden to be
   used or interpreted by applications.  This scheme MUST be consumed
   only by humans.

   Application developers are encouraged to forbid "hxxp" scheme URIs
   inside HTML anchors or tags.
