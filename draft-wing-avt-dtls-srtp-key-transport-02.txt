Abstract

   The existing DTLS-SRTP specification allows SRTP keys to be
   established between a pair of SRTP endpoints.  However, when there
   are more than two participants in an RTP session, DTLS-SRTP is unable
   to provide a single key for all of the participants.  This existing
   limitation of DTLS-SRTP prevents deploying DTLS-SRTP in certain
   scenarios.

   This document describes an extension to DTLS-SRTP, called Key
   Transport (KTR).  This extension transports SRTP keying material from
   one DTLS-SRTP peer to another, so the same SRTP keying material can
   be used by multiple DTLS-SRTP peers.  This extension eliminates the
   need to key each SRTP session individually, allowing cost-effective

Internet-Draft        DTLS-SRTP Key Transport (KTR)            July 2008


1.  Introduction

   When DTLS-SRTP [I-D.ietf-avt-dtls-srtp] establishes Secure RTP
   [RFC3711] master keys, each peer contributes part of the keying
   material to derive the SRTP master key.  In some scenarios it is
   desirable for one peer to change its SRTP key and to transmit SRTP
   packets using an SRTP key that was not derived from the DTLS key
   exchange.  This allows one peer to significantly reduce cryptographic
   operations in many scenarios as described in detail in Section 3.

   The extension described in this document allows transporting an SRTP
   master key from one DTLS peer to the other.  Thus, DTLS Key Transport
   differs from normal DTLS-SRTP in that the SRTP master key is not
   derived from the TLS handshake.


2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   A "listener" is an endpoint that only receives an SRTP stream.  A
   "speaker" is an endpoint that only transmits an SRTP stream.  And
   endpoint can be both a listener and a speaker.


3.  Scenarios

   KTR allows mixers and video switchers to avoid having to encrypt each
   packet multiple times under multiple SRTP keys, by allowing a single
   SRTP key to be shared with the multiple recipients that are receiving
   the SRTP stream.

   Several SRTP scenarios that benefit from KTR are described in the
   following sections, using terminology from RTP Topologies [RFC5117].

3.1.  Point to Multipoint using the RFC 3550 mixer model

   This RTP scenario is described in Section 3.4 of RTP Topologies
   [RFC5117].

   With DTLS-SRTP, this topology is computationally expensive for the
   video switcher because it has to encrypt the payload uniquely for
   each SRTP listener.  Additionally, the architecture of a typical
   mixer requires each listener's SRTP to be encrypted serially,
   incurring additional delay for each successive listener.  This is
   depicted below in Figure 1.

      Figure 1: Point to Multipoint Mixer, without DTLS Key Transport

   With KTR, the mixer can maintain one outbound SRTP cryptographic
   context, and encrypt the SRTP once for all listeners.  This is
   depicted below in Figure 2.

   In the following figure, "=" indicates sessions where DTLS-SRTP Key
   Transport is used, and "-" indicates where only DTLS-SRTP is
   necessary.  In this topology, only the listeners need support KTR so
   that the switcher and the listeners can benefit from KTR.  In this
   scenario with DTLS-SRTP Key Transport, the mixer assumes an
   additional role -- group's key server -- and provides a common group
   SRTP key ("C") to all of the listeners.  This group SRTP key is
   shared between all of the listeners.  The two speakers, however,
   receive a unique stream (just as in the scenario above), but to
   prevent a two-time (padSection 6.2), their content is encrypted using
   a different SRTP keys ("D" and "E").

   The mixer is aware of listeners leaving or joining, and the mixer can
   rekey the remaining active listeners.

3.2.  Point to Multipoint using Multicast

   This RTP topology is described in Section 3.2 of RTP Topologies
   [RFC5117].

   With DTLS-SRTP, this scenario is not attainable because each listener
   has a unique SRTP key.  For this reason, [I-D.ietf-msec-gdoi-srtp]
   was developed by the MSEC working group.

   With KTR, this scenario is attainable because the same key can be
   provided to multiple listeners, as depicted below in Figure 3.  This
   compares favorably with [I-D.ietf-msec-gdoi-srtp] when the group size
   is small enough that the speaker can perform key server functions
   (i.e., perform KTR) for all of the listeners.

3.3.  Point to Multipoint Using Video Switching MCUs

   This RTP topology is described in Section 3.5 of RTP Topologies
   [RFC5117].

   With DTLS-SRTP, this topology is computationally expensive for the
   video switcher because it has to encrypt the payload uniquely for
   each SRTP listener.  Additionally, the architecture of a typical
   video switcher requires each listener's SRTP to be encrypted
   serially, incurring additional delay for each successive listener.
   This is depicted below in Figure 4.

   In the following figure, KTR is used on all sessions and depicted by
   "=".  In this scenario, both the speakers and listeners must support
   KTR so that the switcher and the listeners can benefit from KTR.

                                 Transport

   With DTLS key transport, this becomes easier; in fact, the video
   switcher doesn't need to decrypt the SRTP at all, but just make its
   decision (select the stream or drop the stream) and transmit the SRTP
   packets to the listeners.  This is depicted below in Figure 5.

   The video switcher is aware of listeners leaving or joining.  The
   protocol described in this document allows the switcher to dictate,
   to the speaker, that the speaker use a new encryption key.  This
   allows the switcher to enforce security, based on the switcher's
   policy (Section 6.1).  This is done by the video switcher sending a

   DTLS "your_new_srtp_key" message.  The speaker will respond with a
   DTLS "new_srtp_key" message which echos the same key.  The
   "new_srtp_key" message is relayed, by the switcher, to each of the
   active listeners.

   When there are multiple speakers, as shown in Figure 5 above, each
   speaker transmits with his own SRTP key.  That SRTP key is derived
   from the DTLS handshake with the switcher.  Each speaker uses KTR to
   signal the SSRC that it will use.

3.4.  Scaling to Large Groups

   This section describes how DTLS-SRTP-Key-Transport supports large
   groups of listeners, both for unicast and multicast scenarios.

3.4.1.  Rekeying SRTP Quickly

   When a new listener is added, or an existing listener is removed, a
   new SRTP master key is necessary to retain the security of the SRTP
   media.  Normally this causes "n" cryptographic operations for "n"
   listeners.  These cryptographic operations take time, and if the
   group is large enough or the processor slow enough, there can be a
   considerable delay before all listeners receive the new SRTP key (and
   can decrypt the stream).

   A solution to the problem is to use a subset difference based key
   management scheme [I-D.irtf-smug-subsetdifference].  In this scheme,
   the key server (the speaker) can send a message so that every
   authorized listener -- but no unauthorized listeners -- can decrypt
   the message.  The message contains the new SRTP key.  The advantage
   of this scheme is that subset difference allows the message to be
   encrypted just once, no matter how many listeners there are.

   An implementation of subset-difference based key management is
   Logical Key Heirarchy (LKH) [RFC2627]), which is useful for unicast
   and multicast.  LKH is supported by primitives defined in this
   document, and the LKH "NET KEY" is communicated using the KTR
   primitive "LKH_NET_KEY".

3.4.2.  Distributed Key Servers

   Another problem with all group scenarios is that because each
   listener establishes a DTLS-SRTP session with the speaker, only a
   finite number of listeners can be supported (the speaker cannot
   handle millions of DTLS-SRTP sessions).  This is especially
   problematic for multicast, but is also a problem for "large" groups.

   One workaround to the problem is distributing the DTLS-SRTP keying to

Internet-Draft        DTLS-SRTP Key Transport (KTR)            July 2008


   other devices in the network.  In this scheme, one key server is
   responsible for a sensible number of listeners and has sufficient CPU
   power to update those listeners with new SRTP master keys.  This is
   done with a new SDP attribute, dtls-srtp-ktr-server, which indicates
   the IP address and port of DTLS-SRTP server associated with the media
   line.

   There would need to be some communication between the KTR servers to
   communicate new SRTP keys to the listeners.  This communication is
   for future study.

3.5.  Interworking with Other SRTP Key Management Systems

3.5.1.  Security Descriptions

   Today, Security Descriptions [RFC4568] is used for distributing SRTP
   keys in several different IP PBX systems and is expected to be used
   by 3GPP's Long Term Evolution (LTE).  The IP PBX systems are
   typically used within a single enterprise, and LTE is used within the
   confines of a mobile operator's network.  A Session Border Controller
   is a reasonable solution to interwork between Security Descriptions
   (inside the enterprise or mobile operator) and DTLS-SRTP (outside the
   enterprise), and would be placed at the edge of the enterprise
   network or the edge of the mobile operator's network.

   However, due to the way Security Descriptions and DTLS-SRTP manage
   their SRTP keys, such an SBC has to authenticate, decrypt, re-
   encrypt, and re-authenticate the SRTP (and SRTCP) packets in one
   direction, as shown in Figure 6, below.  This is not desirable as it
   increases the cost of this SBC.

Internet-Draft        DTLS-SRTP Key Transport (KTR)            July 2008


   1.  The Security Descriptions [RFC4568] endpoint discloses its SRTP
       key to the SBC, using a=crypto in its SDP.

   2.  SBC completes DTLS-SRTP handshake.  From this handshake, the SBC
       derives the SRTP key for traffic from the DTLS-SRTP endpoint (key
       B) and to the DTLS-SRTP endpoint (key C).

   3.  The SBC communicates the SRTP encryption key (key B) to the
       Security Descriptions endpoint (using a=crypto).  (There is no
       way, with DTLS-SRTP, to communicate the Security Descriptions key
       to the DTLS-SRTP key endpoint.)

   4.  The DTLS-SRTP endpoint sends an SRTP key, encrypted with its key
       B. This is received by the SBC.

   5.  The received SRTP packet is simply forwarded; the SBC does not
       need to do anything with this packet as its key (key B) was
       already communicated in step 3.

   6.  The Security Descriptions endpoint sends an SRTP packet,
       encrypted with its key A.

   7.  The SBC has to authenticate and decrypt the SRTP packet (using
       key A), and re-encrypt it and generate an HMAC (using key C).

   8.  The SBC sends the new SRTP packet.

   KTR can help avoid the computaionally-expensive operation so the SBC
   does not need not perform any per-packet operations on the SRTP (or
   SRTCP) packets in either direction.  With KTR the SBC can simply
   forward the SRTP (and SRTCP) packets in both directions without per-
   packet HMAC or cryptographic operations.

   To accomplish this, KTR must be supported on the DTLS-SRTP endpoint,
   which allows the SBC to transport the Security Description key to the
   KTR endpoint and send the DTLS-SRTP key to the Security Descriptions
   endpoint.  This works equally well for both incoming and outgoing
   calls.  An abbreviated message flow is shown in Figure 7, below.

Internet-Draft        DTLS-SRTP Key Transport (KTR)            July 2008


4.1.  key_transport (KTR) extension to DTLS-SRTP

   This document adds a new negotiated extension called "key_transport",
   which MUST only be requested in conjunction with the "use_srtp"
   extension (Section 3.2 of [I-D.ietf-avt-dtls-srtp]).  The DTLS server
   indicates its support for key_transport by including key_transport in
   its ServerHello message.  If a DTLS client includes key_transport in
   its ClientHello, but does not receive key_transport in the
   ServerHello, the DTLS client MUST NOT send DTLS packets with the
   srtp_key_transport content-type.

   Support for the DTLS Key Transport extension is indicated in SDP with
   the "srtp-kt" attribute.  Advertising support for the extension is
   necessary in SDP because in some cases it is required to establish an
   SRTP call.  For example, a mixer may be able to only support SRTP
   listeners if those listeners implement DTLS Key Transport (because it
   lacks the CPU cycles necessary to encrypt SRTP uniquely for each
   listener).

   described in [I-D.ietf-avt-dtls-srtp].  This is normal and expected,
   even if Key Transport was negotiated by both sides, as neither side
   may (yet) have a need to alter the SRTP key.  However, it is also
   possible that one (or both) peers will immediately send a

   new_srtp_key message before sending any SRTP.

4.2.  KTR Primitives

   A new protocol is defined, called the srtp_key_transport protocol
   which uses srtp_key_transport content-type which consists of the
   following message types (primitives):

   new_srtp_key_request:  request that the DTLS peer choose a new key.
      Valid responses are new_srtp_key and new_srtp_key_error.

   your_new_srtp_key:  Dictates a new SRTP key for the peer to use when
      the peer transmits its SRTP packets.

   new_srtp_key:  contains the new SRTP keying material, the master key,
      master salt, SSRC, rollover counter, and sequence number.  This
      message is sent by a DTLS endpoint that wants to change its SRTP
      key beginning at the indicated sequence number.  This does not
      change any cryptographic parameters (a new DTLS handshake is
      necessary for that), but only the DTLS key for the associated SRTP
      session.  This message includes the SSRC that will be used for
      this key, which allows listeners to establish one SRTP crypto-
      context per speaker (necessary for the video switching scenario).
      The key chosen MUST be cryptographically random [RFC4086].  This
      master keying material is processed by the standard SRTP key
      deriviation function (Section 4.3.1 of SRTP [RFC3711]) to provide
      the session keys.

   new_key_activate:  indicates receiver is prepared to receive SRTP
      packets encrypted with the new key.

   lkh_net_key  The Logical Key Hierarchy NET KEY.

   new_srtp_key_failure:  indicates a failure.

   At any time, the DTLS client or DTLS server MAY send a key_transport
   message, as shown in Figure 9.  The sender of the new_srtp_key
   message MAY immediately start transmitting SRTP packets with this new
   key.  However, to account for loss of the new_srtp_key message it is
   RECOMMENDED that the sender wait before changing to the new SRTP key
   until it receives the new_key_activate message or it times out
   waiting for the new_key_activate_message.  The duration of this
   timeout may vary depending on the sensitivity of the content (e.g., 1
   second or 10 seconds).  In any case, the new_srtp_key message is
   retransmitted until acknowledged by receipt of a new_key_activate
   message.

Internet-Draft        DTLS-SRTP Key Transport (KTR)            July 2008


4.3.  Procedures for Network Elements

   A 'speaker' is an endpoint that terminates the DTLS-SRTP exchange and
   also sends SRTP data towards its peer(s).  This is usually indicated
   by 'sendrecv' or 'sendonly'.

   A 'listener' is an endpoint that terminates the DTLS-SRTP exchange
   and also receives SRTP data from its peer(s).  This is usually
   indicated by 'sendrecv' or 'recvonly'.

   As the Key Transport extension was negotiated during the DTLS-SRTP
   handshake, an endpoint can send Key Transport primitives, and can
   become a speaker or become a listener, at any point.

4.3.1.  Speaker

   When a new speaker joins, the speaker can immediately send SRTP using
   the key derived from the DTLS-SRTP handshake.  There is no scaling
   advantage to all of the speakers using the same key (because their
   content is different), and if the speakers did use the same key it
   would also introduce the risk of a two-time pad.

   Once a speaker begins sending SRTP packets using a key communicated
   via KTR (i.e., the NewSRTPKey primitive), the speaker MUST NOT revert
   to using the SRTP key derived from the DTLS-SRTP handshake.

   If the speaker wants to use KTR, or is requested to change its SRTP
   key (via the NewSRTPKeyRequest primitive), the speaker chooses a new
   SRTP master key and salt, and chooses a sequence number a reasonable
   distance in the future (1 second is recommended).  The speaker then
   sends this new key using the NewSRTPKey primitive.  The NewSRTPKey
   primitive message is re-transmitted until acknowledged with a
   NewKeyActivate message.  No matter if a NewKeyActiviate is received
   or not, the speaker changes keys at its previously-chosen sequence
   number.

   continue SRTP key may be determined via DTLS-SRTP or by a KTR
   primitives.  In either case, the speaker's SRTP key and SSRC is
   communicated, to each peer.

4.3.2.  Mixer

   When a new speaker joins a mixer, the speaker does not need to
   support KTR, and no KTR procedures need to occur with the speaker.
   This is because the listener needs to decrypt and examine the
   speaker's stream, and the mixer will mix, re-originate (with its own
   SSRC) and re-encrypt the speaker's stream to the listeners.

Internet-Draft        DTLS-SRTP Key Transport (KTR)            July 2008


   The mixer functions as a speaker (Section 4.3.1) towards the
   listeners connected to the mixer.

   When a speaker leaves, there is no need to propagate that information
   beyond the mixer.

   When a listener joins or leaves, the mixer MUST rekey all of the
   listeners based on the conference policy (Section 6.1).

4.3.3.  Switcher

   When a new speaker joins, the switcher communicates the speaker's key
   to all listeners using the NewSRTPKey primitive.  In this way,
   whenever one of the speakers becomes the active speaker, the active
   speaker's SRTP can be immediately sent to all listeners.

   In the event there are a large number of (potentially active)
   speakers and it is not feasible to inform all listeners of all
   speaker's keys, the switcher MAY decide to defer informing
   listeneners of a speaker's key until the speaker becomes the active
   speaker.  This can cause some clipping when a speaker becomes the
   active speaker.

4.3.4.  Listener

   When a listener joins, the listener is provided the same SRTP master
   key as the other listeners.  This is done with the NewSRTPKey
   primitive.  SRTP master keys are associated with both an SSRC and the
   RTP sequence number.  A single SRTP stream might have multiple keys
   active at any point in time, such as when other listeners are joining
   or leaving.  For example, two NewSRTPKey primitives can indicate that
   for a single SSRC value, key "A" is for sequence numbers 100-200, and
   key B is for 200-300.

   If a listener is also a speaker, it also follows the rules of a
   speaker.

   A listener can receive an SRTP packet with an unknown SSRC which
   could caused by either:

   o  the speaker changed its SSRC (due to SSRC collision)

   o  the speaker changed its SRTP master key

   the listener can attempt to authenticate the packet using the most-
   recently-used SRTP master key, which helps in the first case.  If the
   second case has occurred, the listener can only wait until the sender
   (the speaker, the mixer, or the switcher) sends a NewSRTPKey

   primitive.

4.4.  Key Transport SSRC and RTP SSRC Collisions

   Per [RFC3550], if an RTP source notices an RTP SSRC collision, it is
   required to change its SSRC.  If it has negotiated support for KTR,
   it then MUST also send a NewSRTPKey message indicating the new SSRC.
   The communication of the new SSRC is necessary if there are multiple
   speakers in the video switching scenario.  However, because a speaker
   is not able to determine if their audio or their video is being
   switched, a speaker MUST always indicate a change in SSRC by
   following the procedure in this section for any SRTP stream (audio,
   video, or other).

   When this is done, in order to prevent clipping in listeners, it is
   RECOMMENDED that the speaker retain the same SRTP master key and
   salt.

4.5.  Fragmentation, Reassembly, and Retransmission

   Much like the DTLS handshake itself, the KTR extension also needs to
   handle fragmentation and reassembly (to send a large key) and
   retransmission (to account for packet loss).  This is to allow
   communicating SRTP keys which are longer than the network MTU.  The
   same technique as DTLS's handshake are used to provide this function:
   message_seq, fragment_offset, and fragment_length.

   When transmitting the key transport message, the sender divides the
   message into a series of N contiguous data ranges.  These ranges MUST
   NOT be larger than the maximum handshake fragment size and MUST
   jointly contain the entire key transport message.  The ranges SHOULD
   NOT overlap.  The sender then creates N key transport messages, all
   with the same message_seq value as the original key transport
   message.  Each new message is labelled with the fragment_offset (the
   number of bytes contained in previous fragments) and the
   fragment_length (the length of this fragment).  The length field in
   all messages is the same as the length field of the original message.
   An unfragmented message is a degenerate case with fragment_offset=0
   and fragment_length=length.

   When a DTLS implementation receives a key transport message fragment,
   it MUST buffer it until it has the entire key transport message.
   DTLS implementations MUST be able to handle overlapping fragment
   ranges.  This allows senders to retransmit key transport messages
   with smaller fragment sizes during path MTU discovery.

Internet-Draft        DTLS-SRTP Key Transport (KTR)            July 2008


4.6.  SDP extensions

   Two new SDP attributes are defined, dtls-srtp-ktr and dtls-srtp-ktr-
   server. dtls-srtp-ktr merely indicates the endpoint is capable of
   DTLS-SRTP-KTR, and is helpful to diagnose interoperability issues.
   dtls-srtp-ktr-server causes the DTLS handshake to occur with a
   different host than that indicated by the c/m lines, which is useful
   to help offload computational effort from the speaker
   (Section 3.4.2).  Either attribute can appear at the media level or
   session level.

   The ABNF [RFC5234] for new SDP [RFC4566] attributes is as follows:

     ktr-server  = "dtls-srtp-ktr-server:" port
                   [space nettype space addrtype
                    space connection-address]
     ktr-capable = "dtls-srtp-ktr"


   Only the port is required; if the nettype is not indicated, the
   network type, address type, and connection-address are all the same
   as on the associated c= line.

6.  Security Considerations

   In the point-to-multipoint scenario, Section 3.1, all of the
   listeners know the key being used by the mixer.  Any of those
   listeners could create SRTP packets that are encrypted with this same
   key, and send those SRTP packets to other listeners.  In order to
   reduce the vulnerability to this threat, it is RECOMMENDED that the
   source transport address of received SRTP packets be discarded if
   they do not match the source transport address of the associated
   DTLS-SRTP session.  Additionally, the network SHOULD prevent IP
   address spoofing [RFC2827].

6.1.  Group Policy when Joining/Leaving

   When sharing SRTP keys with several listeners, it is imperative that
   the SRTP is changed when a new listener is added or a listener is
   removed.  This is because a legitimate listener should only be able
   to decrypt the SRTP stream while he is listening; he should not be
   able to decrypt the SRTP stream prior to joining the conference or
   after leaving the conference.  Failing to change the key when a
   listener joins (or leaves) allows a listener to decrypt SRTP traffic
   prior to (or after) they are authorized participants in the
   conference.

   Policies for a specific user's access to a conference may be
   different from conference to conference.  For example, a company-
   internal event announcing promotions might be accessible to all
   employees and have no need for re-keying when listeners join or leave
   the conference.  As another example, a conference where a job
   candidate is interviewed should be rekeyed when the job candidate
   joins the conference and again when the job candidate leaves the

   conference.

   The protocol described in this document allows whichever policy is
   needed for a particular situation.  The protocol itself does not
   enforce a certain policy; that is, the protocol itself does not
   ensure the SRTP key is changed when a listener leaves (or joins) the
   conference.

   The RTP sequence number in the NewSRTPKey primitive allows the old
   key to be used for a predictable period of time before switching to
   the new key.  This can provide sufficient time for all listeners to
   learn the new SRTP key before the sender switches to the new key.

6.2.  Two-Time Pad

   [[expand this section.]]

   In some scenarios, different data is sent to different participants.
   For example, in the audio mixer scenario, the active speaker receives
   a different stream than the other listeners; the active speaker's
   stream does not contain the active speaker's own input.  It is
   critical that the same SRTP key is not used for the different
   content, or else a (so-called) "two-time pad" occurs (Section 9.1 of
   [RFC3711]).

   The same SRTP key MUST NOT be used to send different data.

Appendix A.  Relationship with EKT

   Encrypted Key Transport (EKT) [I-D.mcgrew-srtp-ekt] uses RTCP to send
   new SRTP keys.  For EKT to operate, it needs to distribute its Key
   Encryption Key (KEK) to all authorized listeners, and EKT describes
   how Security Descriptions can be provide that function.  While KTR
   could also provide the same function, KTR as described in this
   document does not support EKT.

   This is because EKT can not satisfy the video switching scenario
   (Section 3.3) when listeners are ejected or added to the group.  In
   order for EKT to work in that scenario, the video switcher would have
   to synthesize RTCP packets on behalf of the video sender, or the
   video switcher would have to tell the video sender exactly how to
   generate its EKT KEK message for consumption by the DTLS-SRTP-Key-
   Transport listeners -- which is something only the video switcher
   should be responsible for doing.  Even more complexity would be
   introduced if LKH is used between the video switcher and the
   listeners, because only the video switcher is aware of the group
   membership (the speaker is not) and the video switcher would have to
   communicate LKH hierarchical information to the speaker so the
   speaker could generate the EKT message.  This would distribute LKH

Internet-Draft        DTLS-SRTP Key Transport (KTR)            July 2008


   between the speaker and the video switcher.  It is more desirable to
   retain LKH complexity within the video switcher -- as is proposed in
   Section 3.4.

   For the other scenarios, EKT or KTR would work equally well.  But EKT
   still needs a way to securely communicate its Key Encryption Key to
   the authorized listeners, and if KTR was used to provide that
   function, there seems no value in using EKT to distribute new keys --
   KTR can do that.

   For these reasons, KTR does not describe how it would work with EKT.
