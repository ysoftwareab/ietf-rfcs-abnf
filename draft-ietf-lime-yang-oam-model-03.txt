      Generic YANG Data Model for Connection Oriented Operations,
             Administration, and Maintenance(OAM) protocols
                   draft-ietf-lime-yang-oam-model-03

Abstract

   This document presents a base YANG Data model for connection oriented
   OAM protocols.  It provides a technology-independent abstraction of
   key OAM constructs for connection oriented protocols.  Based model
   presented here can be extended to include technology specific
   details.  This is leading to uniformity between OAM protocols and
   support nested OAM workflows (i.e., performing OAM functions at
   different levels through a unified interface).

1.  Introduction

   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) are important
   networking functions that allow operators to:

   1.  Monitor networks connections (Connectivity Verification,
       Continuity Check).

   2.  Troubleshoot failures (Fault verification and localization).

   3.  Monitor Performance

Internet-Draft     Connection-Oriented OAM YANG model         March 2016


   An overview of OAM tools is presented at [RFC7276].

   Ping and Traceroute [RFC792], [RFC4443] are well-known fault
   verification and isolation tools, respectively, for IP networks.
   Over the years, different technologies have developed similar tools
   for similar purposes.

   [IEEE802.1Q] Connectivity Fault Management is a well-established OAM
   standard that is widely adopted for Ethernet networks.  ITU-T
   [Y.1731][Y.1731], MEF Service OAM, MPLS-TP [RFC6371], TRILL
   [RFC7455][RFC7455] all define OAM methods based on manageability
   frame work of [IEEE802.1Q] [IEEE802.1Q]CFM.

   Given the wide adoption of the underlying OAM concepts defined in
   [IEEE802.1Q][IEEE802.1Q] CFM, it is a reasonable choice to develop
   the unified management framework for connection oriented OAM based on
   those concepts.  In this document, we take the
   [IEEE802.1Q][IEEE802.1Q] CFM model and extend it to a technology
   independent framework and build the corresponding YANG model
   accordingly.  The YANG model presented in this document is the base
   model for connection oriented OAM protocols and supports generic
   continuity check, connectivity verification and path discovery.  The
   generic YANG model for connection oriented OAM is designed such that
   it can be extended to cover various connection oriented technologies.
   Technology dependent nodes and RPC (remote process call) commands are
   defined in technology specific YANG models, which use and extend the
   base model defined here.  As an example, VXLAN uses source UDP port
   number for flow entropy, while TRILL uses either MAC addresses, the
   VLAN tag or fine grain label or IP addresses for flow entropy in the
   hashing for multipath selection.  To capture this variation,
   corresponding YANG models would define the applicable structures as
   augmentation to the generic base model presented here.  This
   accomplishes three purposes: first it keeps each YANG model smaller
   and manageable.  Second, it allows independent development of
   corresponding YANG models.  Third, implementations can limit support
   to only the applicable set of YANG models. (e.g.  TRILL RBridge may
   only need to implement Generic model and the TRILL YANG model).

   All implementations that follow the YANG framework presented in this
   document MUST implement the generic connection oriented YANG model
   presented here.

   The YANG data model presented in this document is generated at the
   management layer.  Encapsulations and state machines may differ
   according to each OAM protocol.  A user who wishes to issues a
   Continuity Check command or a Loop back or initiate a performance
   monitoring session can do so in the same manner regardless of the
   underlying protocol or technology or specific vendor implementation.

   As an example, consider a scenario where Lookback from device A to
   Device B failed.  Between device A and B there are IEEE 802.1 bridges
   a,b and c.  Let's assume a,b and c are using [IEEE802.1Q] CFM.  A
   user upon detecting the Loopback failures may decide to drill down to
   the lower level at the different portion of the path and issue the
   corresponding fault verification (LBM) and fault isolation (LTM)
   tools, using the same API.  This ability to go down to the different
   portion of path at lower level for Fault localization and
   troubleshooting is referred to as "nested OAM workflow" and is a
   useful concept that leads to efficient network troubleshooting and
   maintenance.  The connection oriented OAM YANG model presented in
   this document facilitates that without needing changes to the
   underlying protocols.

         also that they are connected through the expected path,
         allowing detection of unexpected topology changes.

3.  Architecture of Generic YANG Model for OAM

   In this document we define a generic YANG model for connection
   oriented OAM protocols.  The YANG model defined here is generic such
   that other technologies can extend it for technology specific needs.
   The Generic YANG model acts as the root for other OAM YANG models.
   This allows users to traverse between different OAM protocols at ease
   through a uniform API set.  This is also provides a nested OAM
   workflow.  Figure 1 depicts the relationship of different OAM YANG
   models to the Generic YANG Model for connection oriented OAM.  The
   Generic YANG model for OAM provides a framework where technology-
   specific YANG models can inherit constructs from the base YANG models
   without needing to redefine them within the sub-technology.

   Figure 1 depicts relationship of different YANG modules.

4.  Overview of the OAM Model

   In this document we adopt the concepts of the [IEEE802.1Q] CFM model
   and structure it such that it can be adapted to different OAM
   protocols for connection oriented technology.

   At the top of the Model is the Maintenance Domain.  Each Maintenance
   Domain is associated with a Maintenance Name and a Domain Level.

   Under each Maintenance Domain there is one or more Maintenance
   Association (MA).  In TRILL this can be per Fine-Grained Label or for
   VPLS this can be per VPLS instance.

   Under each MA, there can be two or more MEPs (Maintenance Association
   End Points).  MEPs are addressed by their respective technology
   specific address identifiers.  The YANG model presented here provides
   flexibility to accommodate different addressing schemes.

   In the vertical direction orthogonal to the Maintenance Domain,
   presented are the commands.  Those, in YANG terms, are the rpc
   commands.  These rpc commands provide uniform APIs for continuity
   check,connectivity verification, path discovery and their equivalents
   as well as other OAM commands.

   The generic YANG model defined here does not require explicit
   configuration of OAM entities prior to using any of the OAM tools.The
   OAM tools used here are limited to OAM toolset specified in section
   5.1 of [RFC7276].  In order to facilitate zero- touch experience,
   this document defines a default mode of OAM.  The default mode of OAM
   is referred to as the Base Mode and specifies default values for each
   of model parameters, such as Maintenance Domain Level, Name of the
   Maintenance Association and Addresses of MEP and so on.  The default
   values of these depend on the technology.  Base Mode for TRILL is
   defined in [RFC7455].  Base mode for other technologies such as MPLS-
   TP and future extensions will be defined in their corresponding
   documents.

   It is important to note that, no specific enhancements are needed in
   the YANG model to support Base Mode.  Implementations that comply
   with this document, by default implement the data nodes of the
   applicable technology.  Data nodes of the Base Mode are read-only
   nodes.

4.1.  Maintenance Domain (MD) configuration

   The container "domains" is the top level container within the gen-oam
   module.  Within the container "domains", separate list is maintained
   per MD.  The MD list uses the key MD-name-string for indexing.  MD-

   name-string is a leaf and derived from type string.  Additional name
   formats as defined in [IEEE802.1Q] or other standards can be included
   by association of the MD-name-format with an identity-ref.  MD-name-
   format indicates the format of the augmented MD-names.  MD-name is
   presented as choice/case construct.  Thus, it is easily augmentable
   by derivative work.

   Within a given Maintenance Domain there can be one or more
   Maintenance Associations (MA).  MAs are represented as a list and
   indexed by the MA-name-string.  Similar to MD-name defined
   previously, additional name formats can be added by augmenting the
   name-format identity-ref and adding applicable case statements to MA-
   name.

4.4.  rpc definitions

   The rpc model facilitates issuing commands to a NETCONF server (in
   this case to the device that need to execute the OAM command) and
   obtain a response. rpc model defined here abstracts OAM specific
   commands in a technology independent manner.

Internet-Draft     Connection-Oriented OAM YANG model         March 2016


   There are several rpc commands defined for the purpose of OAM.  In
   this section we present a snippet of the continuity check command for
   illustration purposes.  Please refer to Section 4 for the complete
   data hierarchy and Section 5 for the YANG model.

6.  Base Mode

   The Base Mode defines default configuration that MUST be present in
   the devices that comply with this document.  Base Mode allows users
   to have "zero-touch" experience.  Several parameters require
   technology specific definition.

6.1.  MEP Address

   In the Base Mode of operation, the MEP Address is by default the IP
   address of the interface on which the MEP is located.

6.2.  MEP ID for Base Mode

   In the Base Mode of operation, each device creates a single UP MEP
   associated with a virtual OAM port with no physical layer (NULL PHY).
   The MEPID associated with this MEP is zero (0).  The choice of MEP-ID
   zero is explained below.

   MEPID is 2 octet field by default.  It is never used on the wire
   except when using CCM.  Ping, traceroute and session monitoring does
   not use the MEPID on its message header.  It is important to have
   method that can derive MEP ID of base mode in an automatic manner
   with no user intervention.  IP address cannot be directly used for
   this purpose as the MEP ID is much smaller field.  For Base Mode of
   operation we propose to use MEP ID zero (0) as the default MEP-ID.

   CCM packet use MEP-ID on the payload.  CCM MUST NOT be used in the
   Base Mode.  Hence CCM MUST be disabled on the Maintenance Association
   of the Base Mode.

   If CCM is required, users MUST configure a separate Maintenance
   association and assign unique value for the corresponding MEP IDs.

   [IEEE802.1Q] CFM defines MEP ID as an unsigned integer in the range 1
   to 8191.  In this document we propose to extend the range to 0 to
   65535.  Value 0 is reserved for MEP ID of Base Mode operation and
   MUST NOT be used for other purposes.

6.3.  Maintenance Domain

   Default MD-LEVEL is set to 3.

6.4.  Maintenance Association

   MAID [IEEE802.1Q] has a flexible format and includes two parts:
   Maintenance Domain Name and Short MA name.  In the Based Mode of
   operation, the value of the Maintenance Domain Name must be the

   character string "GenericBaseMode" (excluding the quotes ").  In Base
   Mode operation Short MA Name format is set to 2-octet integer format
   (value 3 in Short MA Format field [IEEE802.1Q]) and Short MA name set
   to 65532 (0xFFFC).

7.  Note

   This section will be removed or subject to change in the future if
   any agreement is reached.  As per investigation of RFC7276 for
   performance Monitoring for Loss and Delay are defined for MPLS
   OAM(RFC6374[RFC6374]), OWAMP (RFC4656[RFC4656]) and TWAMP
   (RFC5357[RFC5357]) and TRILL OAM (RFC7456[RFC7456]).  In case of
   Performance Monitoring Statistics are common between these
   technologies thus generic Yang model for Performance will be worked
   out through separate draft with Augmentation of Generic LIME model.
   In case of Other Function, it's technology specific and thus should
   be dealt in technology specific Yang model instead of Generic Model.

8.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module defined in this memo is designed to be accessed via
   the NETCONF protocol [RFC6241] [RFC6241].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is SSH [RFC6242] [RFC6242].  The NETCONF access control
   model [RFC6536] [RFC6536] provides the means to restrict access for
   particular NETCONF users to a pre-configured subset of all available
   NETCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in the YANG module which are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., <edit-config>)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.

   The vulnerable "config true" subtrees and data nodes are the
   following:

   /goam:domains/goam:domain/

   /goam:domains/goam:domain/goam:MAs/goam:MA/

   /goam:domains/goam:domain/goam:MAs/goam:MA/goam:MEP

   /goam:domains/goam:domain/goam:MAs/goam:MA/goam:MEP/goam:session/

   Unauthorized access to any of these lists can adversely affect OAM
   management system handling of end-to-end OAM and coordination of OAM

   within underlying network layers This may lead to inconsistent
   configuration, reporting, and presentation for the OAM mechanisms
   used to manage the network.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers a URI in the IETF XML registry [RFC3688]
   [RFC3688].  Following the format in RFC 3688, the following
   registration is requested to be made:

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-gen-oam

   Registrant Contact: The IESG.

   XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   This document registers a YANG module in the YANG Module Names
   registry [RFC6020].

  name: ietf-gen-oam namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-gen-oam
     prefix: goam reference: RFC XXXX

10.  Acknowledgments

   Giles Heron came up with the idea of developing a YANG model as a way
   of creating a unified OAM API set (interface), work in this document
   is largely an inspiration of that.  Alexander Clemm provided many
   valuable tips, comments and remarks that helped to refine the YANG
   model presented in this document.
