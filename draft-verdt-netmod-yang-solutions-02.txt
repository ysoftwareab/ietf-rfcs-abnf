1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-versioning-reqs] documents the requirements for
   any solution to the YANG [RFC7950] versioning problem.  Chapter 5
   lists the formal requirements that a complete solution requires.

   The aim of this draft is to help readers understand how the different
   solution drafts fit together, and also which drafts contribute
   solutions to particular individual requirements.  The overall
   solution comprises five individual drafts:

   1.  [I-D.verdt-netmod-yang-module-versioning]

   2.  [I-D.verdt-netmod-yang-semver]

   3.  [I-D.rwilton-netmod-yang-packages]

   4.  [I-D.wilton-netmod-yang-ver-selection]

   5.  YANG schema comparison tooling (not yet published)

   Open issues, across all of the solution drafts are tracked at
   <https://github.com/netmod-wg/yang-ver-dt/issues>.

2.  Solution Drafts

   The complete solution to the YANG versioning requirements comprises
   five solution drafts, that are summarized below.

Internet-Draft      YANG Versioning Solution Overview      November 2019


2.1.  Updated YANG Module Revision Handling

   In summary, [I-D.verdt-netmod-yang-module-versioning] specifies
   minimal extensions and updates to the YANG language, YANG Library,
   and YANG author guidelines to provide more flexible YANG module
   revision handling.  The intent is that these changes and extensions
   could be folded into future revisions of the updated specifications.
   The draft provides a solution for all requirements except Req 2.2,
   Req 3.1 and Req 3.2.

   The extensions and changes in the draft can be summarized thus:

   o  It defines a YANG extension statement to indicate where non-
      backwards-compatible changes have occurred in a module's revision
      history.

   o  It relaxes the rules for the module revision history to allow for
      a non-linear module revision history.  I.e., any given module
      revision may have multiple revisions directly derived from it.

   o  It defines a new import extension statement that restricts the
      allowed module revisions that satisfy the import to only those
      derived from a specified module revision.

   o  It defines a revision label extension statement to allow an
      informative name to be associated with a particular revision date,
      and to be used in import statements, YANG module filenames, and is
      available in YANG library.  One example of how the revision label
      could be used is to associate a semantic versioning scheme to YANG
      module revisions.

   o  It updates the YANG rules for changes between module revisions
      that are allowed to be classified as backwards-compatible.  In
      particular, marking a node as obsolete is no longer classified as
      a backwards compatible change.

   o  It provides updated guidance on how servers handle deprecated and
      obsolete YANG nodes and augments YANG library with additional
      leaves to report the server's behavior to clients.

   o  It provides an extension statement to allow a description
      statement to be associated with a YANG status statement, providing
      more information about why the status has changed.

   o  It defines how versioning relates to YANG instance data.

   o  It refines the guidelines for updating modules, taking into
      consideration that non-backwards-compatible changes are sometimes
      necessary for various pragmatic reasons.

2.2.  Module semantic version number scheme

   [I-D.verdt-netmod-yang-semver] defines a semantic versioning scheme
   derived from the semver.org 2.0.0 specification that can be used in
   conjunction with the revision label extension statement defined in
   Section 2.1 to allow semantic version numbers to be used to manage
   the revision lifecycle of YANG modules.  This draft provides an
   enhanced solution for Req 2.1, but organizations authoring modules
   are not obliged to use this specific versioning scheme, and could
   choose a different overlaid versioning scheme, or none at all and
   rely solely on revision dates.

   The aims of the YANG semantic versioning scheme are:

      To generally allow clients to determine whether NBC changes have
      occurred between two revisions from the version number alone,
      without having to check the full revision history.

      To give a more informative identifier for a branched revision
      history over revision dates alone.

      To allow revision branches that contain fixes for published non-
      latest releases.

2.3.  Versioned YANG packages

   The two previous drafts address version and revision management of
   individual modules.  [I-D.rwilton-netmod-yang-packages] provides a
   mechanism to group a set of related YANG modules revisions together,
   into a construct called a YANG package, and to apply a version scheme
   to the group.

   The core part of this draft are YANG module definitions that define a
   YANG package, that are used as an augmentation to YANG library, and
   also in YANG instance data documents for offline access.

   The principle aims of the packages draft are:

      To provide an alternative simpler mechanism to manage conformance
      of modules.  Rather than checking conformance against a set of
      individual YANG module revisions, it should be easier to check for
      conformance against a much smaller set of YANG package versions.

      To provide an easier mechanism for clients to check conformance
      with a server.  Rather that downloading and comparing all
      individual module revisions, the client can just check whether the
      package version is compatible.  The package definition could be
      retrieved and cached from multiple sources.

   The YANG packages draft does not address any of the versioning
   requirements directly, but provides the foundation building blocks
   for the version selection solution, described in Section 2.4, that
   addresses Reqs 3.1 and 3.2.

2.4.  Protocol operations for package version selection

   [I-D.wilton-netmod-yang-ver-selection] specifies a solution for
   requirements 3.1 and 3.2 via the use of
   [I-D.rwilton-netmod-yang-packages] and a protocol based version
   selection scheme that can be used by clients to choose a particular
   YANG datastore schema from the set of datastore schema that are
   supported by the server.

   The version selection optionally allows:

      Servers to support a single, selectable YANG package at a
      particular version, that is used for all NETCONF/RESTCONF
      interactions.

      Servers to support multiple selectable YANG packages and package
      versions, with different clients able to concurrently access
      different packages and different package versions.

2.5.  YANG schema comparison tooling

   A tooling based solution is proposed for Req 2.2, that allows two
   YANG schema versions to be algorithmically compared, with the
   algorithm reporting the list of differences between the two YANG
   schema and whether each change is regarded as being backwards-
   compatible, or non-backwards-compatible.  Annotations to the YANG
   modules, via the use of extension statements, may help improve the
   accuracy of the comparison algorithm, particularly for statements
   that are very hard to algorithmically classify the scope of any
   differences (e.g., a change in the semantic behaviour of a data node
   defined via modifications to the associated YANG description
   statement).  Given that Req 2.2 is a softer requirement, and
   practical experience with the tooling is required, it is proposed
   that this work is deferred at this time.

   When comparing a module schema, a tool would also be able to take
   into account enabled features, deviations, and the subset of the

   schema being used by the client.  This would allow a tooling based
   approach to give a more accurate answer as to whether a client would
   be affected when upgrading between two software versions, than
   looking at the revision history, or comparing semantic version
   numbers.
