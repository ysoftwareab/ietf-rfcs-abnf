Internet-Draft             TE & Service Mapping               June 2018


1. Introduction

   Data models are a representation of objects that can be configured
   or monitored within a system. Within the IETF, YANG [RFC6020] is the
   language of choice for documenting data models, and YANG models have
   been produced to allow configuration or modeling of a variety of
   network devices, protocol instances, and network services. YANG data
   models have been classified in [Netmod-Yang-Model-Classification]
   and [Service-YANG].

   [RFC4110] provides a framework for Layer 3 Provider-Provisioned
   Virtual Private Networks (PPVPNs). [L3SM-YANG] provides a L3VPN
   service delivery YANG model for PE-based VPNs. The scope of this
   draft is limited to a set of domain under the same network operators
   to deliver services requiring TE tunnels.

   [ACTN-VN-YANG] describes how customers or end to end orchestrators
   can request and/or instantiate a generic virtual network service.
   [ACTN-Applicability] describes a connection between IETF YANG model
   classifications to ACTN interfaces. In particular, it describes the
   customer service model can be mapped into the CMI (CNC-MDSC
   Interface) of the ACTN architecture.

   While IP/MPLS PNC is responsible for provisioning the VPN service on
   the PE nodes, the MDSC can coordinate how to map the VPN services
   with TE tunnels. This is consistent with the two of the core
   functions of the MDSC specified in [ACTN-Frame]:

     . Customer mapping/translation function: This function is to map
        customer requests/commands into network provisioning requests
        that can be sent to the Physical Network Controller (PNC)
        according to business policies provisioned statically or
        dynamically. Specifically, it provides mapping and translation
        of a customer's service request into a set of parameters that
        are specific to a network type and technology such that network
        configuration process is made possible.

     . Virtual service coordination function: This function translates
        customer service-related information into virtual network
        service operations in order to seamlessly operate virtual
        networks while meeting a customer's service requirements. In
        the context of ACTN, service/virtual service coordination
        includes a number of service orchestration functions such as
        multi-destination load balancing, guarantees of service
        quality, bandwidth and throughput. It also includes
        notifications for service fault and performance degradation and
        so forth.

Internet-Draft             TE & Service Mapping               June 2018


   The YANG model described in this document provides an ACTN TE-
   service mapping model that enables a seamless service mapping across
   L1/2/3 VPN, ACTN VN and TE-Topology/TE-tunnel models at the
   controllers.

2. TE-Service Mapping Model

   The role of TE-service Mapping model is to create a mapping
   relationship between service models and TE models so that VN/VPN
   service instantiation would be seamlessly provided by the underlying
   TE networks. It also allows for the customers to access operational
   state information as to how their services are instantiated with the
   underlying TE topology or TE tunnels. This mapping will facilitate a
   seamless service management operation with underlay-TE network
   visibility.

   Figure 1 shows TE-Service Mapping Model's scope.

                       Figure 1. TE-Service Mapping


   As seen in Figure 1, the TE-Service Mapping Model provides a mapping
   between the LxSM and the ACTN VN YANG model which allows customers
   (internal or external) to create a VN that meets the customer's
   service objective with various constraints via TE-topology model
   [TE-topo]. The model also supports a direct mapping between LxSM to
   TE-topology or TE-tunnel.

   The TE-service model developed in this document can also be extended
   to support other services beyond L3SM, L2SM and L1CSM.

Internet-Draft             TE & Service Mapping               June 2018


   Moreover, the TE-Service Mapping model provides additional service
   parameters and policies that are not included in the respective
   service models such as L3SM [RFC8299], L2SM [L2SM-YANG] and L1CSM
   [L1CSM-YANG]. For example, how VN/TE tunnel should be created (e.g.,
   with an isolation level) for a certain service instance is described
   in the TE-Service Mapping model.

2.1. VN/Tunnel Selection Requirements

   In some cases, under the confines of service policy, TE network
   slicing isolation requirement may need to be supported for the VPN
   service. This may occur when there are no suitable existing TE
   tunnels that can support VPN service requirements. Or the operator
   would like to dynamically create and bind tunnels to the VPN, which
   could not be shared for network slicing.

   To summarize there are three modes of VN/Tunnel selection operations
   to be supported, but not limited to:

        o New VN/Tunnel Binding - Customer could request an L3VPN
          service [L3SM-YANG] with a new VN/Tunnel not shared with
          other existing services. This is to meet VPN isolation
          requirement. Further the mapping yang model described in
          Section 5 of this document is used to set this mapping
          between the L3VPN service and the ACTN VN. Note that this
          could be done dynamically. The VN (and TE tunnels) could be
          bound to the L3VPN and not used for any other VPN.

          Under this mode, the following sub-categories can be
          supported:

          1. Hard Isolation with deterministic characteristics:
             Customer would request an LxVPN service using a set of TE
             Tunnels with a deterministic characteristics requirement
             (e.g., no latency variation) and that cannot be not shared
             with other LxVPN services nor compete for bandwidth with
             other Tunnels.

          2. Hard Isolation: This is similar to the above case without
             deterministic characteristics requirements.

          3. Soft Isolation: Customer would request an LxVPN service
             using a set of MPLS-TE tunnel which cannot be shared with
             other LxVPN services.

Internet-Draft             TE & Service Mapping               June 2018


        o VN/Tunnel Sharing - Customer could request an L3VPN service
          [L3SM-Yang], and with this model as input, the PNC configures
          the different network elements to deliver the service. Each
          network element would select a tunnel based on the
          configuration. With this mode, new tunnels (or VN) are not
          created for each VPN. Thus, the tunnels can be shared across
          multiple VPN. Further the mapping yang model described in
          Section 5 of this document is used to get the mapping between
          the L3VPN and the tunnels in use. No modification is allowed
          when an existing tunnel is selected.

          Under this mode, the following sub-categories can be
          supported:

          1. resource multiplexing

          2. resource partition

          3. ultra resource partition



        o VN/Tunnel Modify - This mode allows the modification of the
          properties of the existing VN/tunnel (e.g., bandwidth) when
          VN/Tunnel Selection Mode is applied.


   Other mode of VN/Tunnel selection operations could be easily added
   to the current model in the future.

2.2. Availability Requirements

   Availability is another LxVPN's service requirement that needs to be
   conveyed by the TE & Service Mapping model. The availability
   parameters will be met when a VN or Tunnel is selected by the
   protection level of the TE-topology or TE tunnel model.


   [Editor's Note: Availability level will be provided]

        Figure 1: L3VPN Architecture from the IP+Optical Network Perspective



   There are three main entities in the architecture.

  . MDSC: This entity is responsible for coordinating a L3VPN service
     request (expressed in L3SM) with the IP PNC and the Transport PNC.
     One of the key responsibilities of the MDSC for TE services is to
     coordinate with both the IP PNC and the Transport PNC for the
     mapping of L3VPN Service Model and ACTN VN model. With the VN/TE-
     tunnel binding case, the MDSC will need to coordinate with the
     Transport PNC to dynamically create the TE-tunnel(s) in the
     Transport network as needed. These tunnels are added as links in
     the IP Layer topology. The MDSC coordinates with IP PNC to create
     the TE-tunnel(s) in the IP layer, as part of the ACTN VN creation.

Internet-Draft             TE & Service Mapping               June 2018



  . IP/MPLS PNC: This entity is responsible for device configuration
     to create PE-PE L3VPN tunnels for the VPN customer and for the
     configuration of the L3VPN VRF on the PE nodes. Each network
     element would select a tunnel based on the configuration.

  . Transport PNC: This entity is responsible for device configuration
     for TE tunnels in the transport networks.

   High-Level Control Flows

     1. Customer asks for a L3VPN between CE1 and CE2 with TE
        constraints using L3SM model. The customer can provide tunnel
        creation policy where it allows dynamic VN/TE tunnel creation
        or not. Under this policy, dynamic VN/TE tunnels can be created
        when there are no proper VN/TE-tunnels that can support L3VPN
        tunnels or when there is a strict isolation requirement for the
        VPN service, e.g., no sharing with other tunnels is allowed.

     2. The MDSC determines if it needs to create a new VN, and if that
        is the case, ACTN VN YANG [ACTN-VN-YANG] is used to configure a
        new VN based on this VPN and map the VPN service to ACTN VN. In
        case an existing tunnel is to be used, each device will select
        which tunnel to use and populates this mapping information.

     3. The MDSC interacts with both the IP/MPLS PNC and the Transport
        PNC to create a PE-PE tunnel in the IP network mapped to a TE
        tunnel in the transport network by providing the inter-layer
        access points and tunnel requirements. The specific service
        information are passed to the IP/MPLS PNC for the actual VPN
        configuration and activation.

          a. The Transport PNC creates the corresponding TE tunnel
             matching with the access point and egress point.
          b. The IP/MPLS PNC maps the VPN ID with the corresponding TE
             tunnel ID to bind these two IDs.

     4. The IP/MPLS PNC creates/updates a VRF instance for this VPN
        customer. This is not in the scope of this document..

6. Security

   The configuration, state, and action data defined in this document
   are designed to be accessed via a management protocol with a secure
   transport layer, such as NETCONF [RFC6241].  The NETCONF access
   control model [RFC6536] provides the means to restrict access for
   particular NETCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available
   NETCONF protocol operations and content.

   A number of configuration data nodes defined in this document are
   writable/deletable (i.e., "config true") These data nodes may be
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
