<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>The Access Node Control Protocol (ANCP) aims to communicate QoS-related, service-related and
        subscriber-related configurations and operations between a Network Access Server (NAS) and an Access Node
        (e.g., a Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer (DSLAM)). The main goal of this protocol
        is to allow the NAS to configure, manage and control access equipments including the ability for the access nodes
         to report information to the NAS.
</p>
<p>The present document investigates security threats that all ANCP nodes could encounter. This document develops
        a threat model for ANCP security aiming to decide which security functions are required. Based on this, security 
        requirements regarding the Access Node Control Protocol are defined.

Introduction</h3>

<p>The Access Node Control Protocol (ANCP) aims to communicate QoS-related, service-related and
        subscriber-related configurations and operations between a Network Access Server (NAS) and an Access Node
        (e.g., a Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer (DSLAM)).

        <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-ancp-framework'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;ancp&#8209;framework]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ooghe, S., Voigt, N., Platnic, M., Haag, T., and S. Wadhwa, &ldquo;Framework and Requirements for an Access Node Control Mechanism in Broadband Multi-Service Networks,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a> illustrates the framework, usage scenarios and
        general requirements for ANCP. This document focuses on describing security threats and deriving 
        security requirements for the Access Node Control Protocol, considering the ANCP use cases defined in 
	<a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-ancp-framework'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;ancp&#8209;framework]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ooghe, S., Voigt, N., Platnic, M., Haag, T., and S. Wadhwa, &ldquo;Framework and Requirements for an Access Node Control Mechanism in Broadband Multi-Service Networks,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a> as well as the guidelines for IETF protocols' 
        security requirements given in <a class='info' href='#RFC3365'>[RFC3365]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schiller, J., &ldquo;Strong Security Requirements for Internet Engineering            Task Force Standard Protocols,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>. Security policy negotiation,
        including authentication and authorization to define the per-subscriber policy at the
        policy/AAA server, is out of the scope of this work. As a high-level summary, the following
        aspects need to be considered:</p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt>Message Protection:</dt>
<dd> 
            <br />
 Signaling message content can be protected against
            eavesdropping, modification, injection and replay while in transit. This applies to both 
            ANCP header and payloads.<br />
<br />

          
</dd>
<dt>Prevention against Impersonation:</dt>
<dd>
            <br />
 It is important that protection be available against a device impersonating an 
            ANCP node (i.e. an unauthorized device generating an ANCP message and pretending it was generated by a valid 
            ANCP node).<br />
<br />

          
</dd>
<dt>Prevention of Denial of Service Attacks:</dt>
<dd>
            <br />
 ANCP nodes and the network have finite resources (state
            storage, processing power, bandwidth). Exhaustion attacks against these resources and
            not allowing ANCP nodes to be used to launch attacks on other network elements is of
            great importance.

System Overview and Threat Model</h3>

<p>As described in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-ancp-framework'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;ancp&#8209;framework]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ooghe, S., Voigt, N., Platnic, M., Haag, T., and S. Wadhwa, &ldquo;Framework and Requirements for an Access Node Control Mechanism in Broadband Multi-Service Networks,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a> and schematically shown in <a class='info' href='#overview'>Figure&nbsp;1<span> (</span><span class='info'>System Overview</span><span>)</span></a>, the Access Node Control system consists of the following
          components:</p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt>Network Access Server (NAS):</dt>
<dd>
            <br />
 A NAS provides access to a service (e.g., network access) and
            operates as a client of the AAA protocol. The AAA client is responsible for passing
            authentication information to designated AAA servers and then acting on the response
            that is returned. <br />
<br />

          
</dd>
<dt>Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) server:</dt>
<dd>
            <br />
 A AAA server is responsible for authenticating users, for
            authorizing access to services, and for returning authorization information including
            configuration parameters back to the AAA client to deliver service to the user. As a
            consequence, service usage accounting might be enabled and information about the
            user's resource usage will be sent to the AAA server. <br />
<br />

          
</dd>
<dt>Access Node (AN):</dt>
<dd>
            <br />
 The AN is a network device, usually located at a service
            provider central office or street cabinet, that terminates access loop connections from
            subscribers. In case the access loop is a Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), this is often
            referred to as a DSL Access Multiplexer (DSLAM).<br />
<br />

          
</dd>
<dt>Customer Premises Equipment (CPE):</dt>
<dd>
            <br />
 A CPE is a device located inside a subscriber's premise that is connected at the LAN 
            side of the HGW.<br />
<br />

          
</dd>
<dt>Home Gateway (HGW):</dt>
<dd>
            <br />
 The HGW connects the different Customer Premises Equipments
            (CPE) to the Access Node and the access network. In case of DSL, the HGW is a DSL
            Network Termination (NT) that could either operate as a layer 2 bridge or as a layer 3
            router. In the latter case, such a device is also referred to as a Routing Gateway
          (RG).<br />
<br />

         
</dd>
<dt>Aggregation Network:</dt>
<dd>
            <br />
 The aggregation network provides traffic aggregation from multiple ANs towards the 
             NAS. ATM or Ethernet transport technologies can be used.<br />
<br />

          
</dd>
</dl></blockquote><p>
      
</p>
<p>For the threat analysis, this document focuses on the ANCP protocol communication between the Access Node and the
         NAS. However, communications with the other components, such as HGW, CPE, AAA server play a role in the 
         understanding of the system architecture and of what triggers ANCP protocol communications. Note that the NAS 
         and the AN might belong to two different administrative realms. The threat model and the security requirments in 
         this draft consider this later case.

</p>
<p>In the absence of an attack, the NAS receives configuration information from the AAA server
        related to a CPE attempting to access the network. A number of parameters, including Quality
        of Service information, need to be conveyed to the Access Node in order to become effective.
        The Access Node Control Protocol is executed between the NAS and the AN to initiate control
        requests. The AN returns responses to these control requests and provides information
        reports. 
</p>
<p> For this to happen, the following individual steps must occur:</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The AN discovers the NAS. 
</li>
<li>The AN needs to start the protocol communication with the NAS to announce its presence.
</li>
<li>The AN and the NAS perform a capability exchange.
</li>
<li>The NAS sends requests to the AN.
</li>
<li>The AN processes these requests, authorizes the actions and responds with the
            appropriate answer. In order to fulfill the commands it might be necessary for the AN to
            communicate with the HGW or other nodes, for example as part of a keep alive mechanism.
</li>
<li>The AN provides status reports to the NAS.
</li>
</ul><p>

<p>Attackers can be:

        </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>off-path, i.e., they cannot see the messages exchange between the AN and the NAS; 
</li>
<li>on-path, i.e., they can see the messages exchange between the AN and the NAS.
</li>
</ul><p>
      
</p>
<p>Both off-path and on-path attackers can be:
</p>
<p>
        </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>passive, i.e., they do not participate in the network operation but rather listen to all transfers
            to obtain the maximum possible information;

<p>We assume the following threat model: </p>

Objectives of Attackers</h3>

<p>Attackers may direct their efforts either against an individual entity or against a large
        portion of the access network. Attacks fall into three classes:</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>attacks to disrupt the communication for individual customers.
</li>
<li>attacks to disrupt the communication of a large fraction of customers in an access
            network. These also include attacks to the network itself or a portion of it such as attacks to disrupt the
            network services or attacks to destruct the network functioning.
</li>
<li>attacks to gain profit for the attacker (e.g., by modifying the QoS settings). Also, through replaying old 
	     packets, of another privileged client for instance, an attacker can attempt to configure a better QoS 
             profile on its own DSL line increasing its own benefit.

Potential Attacks</h3>

Denial of Service (DoS)</h3>

<p>A number of denial of service (DoS) attacks can cause ANCP nodes to malfunction. When state is established or 
           certain functions are performed without requiring prior authorization there is a chance to mount denial of 
           service attacks. An adversary can utilize this fact to transmit a large number of signaling messages to 
           allocate state at nodes and to cause resources' consumption. Also, an adversary, through DoS, can prevent 
          certain subscribers to access certain services.

Integrity Violation</h3>

<p>Adversaries gaining illegitimate access on the transferred messages can act on these messages causing integrity
           violation. Integrity violation can cause unexpected network behavior leading to a disturbance in the network
           services as well as the network functioning.

<a name="rfc.section.5.3"></a><h3>5.3.&nbsp;
Downgrading</h3>

<p> Protocols may be useful in a variety of scenarios with different security and functional requirements. 
            Different parts of a network (e.g., within a building, across a public carrier's network, or over a private 
            microwave link) may need different levels of protection. It is often difficult to meet these (sometimes 
            conflicting) requirements with a single mechanism or fixed set of parameters, so often a selection of 
            mechanisms and parameters is offered. A protocol is required to agree on certain (security) mechanisms and 
            parameters. An insecure parameter exchange or security negotiation protocol can give the oppurtunity to an 
            adversary to mount a downgrading attack to force selection of mechanisms weaker than those mutually desired. 
            Thus, without binding the negotiation process to the legitimate parties and protecting it, ANCP might only be 
            as secure as the weakest mechanism provided (e.g., weak authentication) and the benefits of defining 
            configuration parameters and a negotiation protocol are lost.

Traffic Analysis</h3>

<p> An adversary can be placed at the NAS, or the AN, or any other network element capturing all traversing 
            packets. Adversaries can thus have unauthorized information access. As well, they can gather information
            relevant to the network and then use this information in gaining later unauthorized access. This attack can 
            also help adversaries in other malicious purposes, as for example capturing messages sent from the AN to the 
            NAS announcing that a DSL line is up and containing some information related to the connected client. 
	    This could be any form of information about the client and could also be an indicator whether the DSL 
            subscriber is at home or not at a particular moment.

Attack Forms</h3>

<p>The attacks mentioned above in <a class='info' href='#attacks'>Section&nbsp;5<span> (</span><span class='info'>Potential Attacks</span><span>)</span></a> can be carried out through the following means:
</p>
<p>
	</p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Message Replay:</dt>
<dd>
           <br />
 This threat scenario covers the case in which an adversary eavesdrops, collects 
            signaling messages, and replays them at a later time (or at a different place or in a different way; e.g., 
            cut-and-paste attacks). Through replaying of signaling messages, an adversary might mount a denial of service 
            and a theft of service attacks.<br />
<br />

        
</dd>
<dt>Faked Message Injection:</dt>
<dd>
           <br />
 An adversary may be able to inject false error or response messages causing unexpected
           protocol behavior and succeeding with a DoS attack. This could be achieved at the signaling protocol level, at 
           the level of a specific signaling parameters (e.g., QoS information), or at the transport layer. An adversary 
           might, for example, inject a signaling message to request allocation of QoS resources. As a consequence, other 
           user's traffic might be impacted. The discovery protocol, especially, exhibits vulnerabilities with regard to 
           this threat scenario.<br />
<br />

        
</dd>
<dt>Messages Modification:</dt>
<dd> 
           <br />
This involves integrity violation, where an adversary can modify signaling messages in 
           order to cause unexpected network behavior. Possible related actions an adversary might consider for its attack
           are reordering and delaying of messages causing a protocol's process failure.<br />
<br />

         
</dd>
<dt>Man-in-the-Middle:</dt>
<dd>
           <br />
An adversary might claim to be a NAS or an AN acting as a man-in-the-middle to later 
            cause communication and services disruption. The consequence can range from DoS to fraud. An adversary acting
            as a man-in-the-middle could modify the intercepted messages causing integrity violation, or could drop or 
           truncate the intercepted messages causing DoS and a protocol's process failure. In addition, a man-in-the-middle            adversary can signal information to an illegitimate entity in place of the right destination. In this case the
            protocol could appear to continue working correctly. This may result in an AN contacting a wrong NAS. For the 
            AN, this could mean that the protocol failed for unknown reasons. A man-in-the-middle adversary can also cause 
            downgrading attacks through initiating faked configuration parameters and through 
            forcing selection of weak security parameters or mechanisms.<br />
<br />

         
</dd>
<dt>Eavesdropping:</dt>
<dd> 
         <br />
This is related to adversaries that are able to eavesdrop on transferred messages. The 
         collection of the transferred packets by an adversary may allow traffic analysis or be used later to mount replay
         attacks. The eavesdropper might learn QoS parameters, communication patterns, policy rules for firewall traversal,
         policy information, application identifiers, user identities, NAT bindings, authorization objects, network
         configuration and performance information, and more.<br />

Attacks Against ANCP</h3>

<p>ANCP is susceptible to security threats, causing disruption/unauthorized access to network
        services, manipulation of the transferred data, and interference with network functions.
        Based on the threat model given in <a class='info' href='#introduction'>Section&nbsp;3<span> (</span><span class='info'>System Overview and Threat Model</span><span>)</span></a> and the potential attacks
        presented in <a class='info' href='#attacks'>Section&nbsp;5<span> (</span><span class='info'>Potential Attacks</span><span>)</span></a>, this section describes the possible attacks against ANCP, considering the 
        four use cases defined in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-ancp-framework'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;ancp&#8209;framework]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ooghe, S., Voigt, N., Platnic, M., Haag, T., and S. Wadhwa, &ldquo;Framework and Requirements for an Access Node Control Mechanism in Broadband Multi-Service Networks,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>Although ANCP protocol is not involved in the communication between the NAS and the AAA/policy server, the 
         secure communication between the NAS and the AAA/policy server is important for ANCP security. Consequently, 
         this draft considers the attacks that are related to the ANCP operation associated with the communication 
         between the NAS and the AAA/Policy server. In other words, the threat model and security requirements in this 
         draft take into consideration the data transfer between the NAS and the AAA server, when this data is used 
         within the ANCP operation.
</p>
<p>Besides the attacks against the four ANCP use cases described in the following subsections, ANCP is 
          susceptible to a number of attacks that can take place during the protocol establishment phase. These attacks
          are mainly on-path attacks, taking the form of DoS or man-in-the-middle attacks, which could be as 
          follows:</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Attacks during the session initiation from the AN to the NAS: DoS attacks could take place affecting the 
           session establishment process. Also, Man-in-the-middle attacks could take place, causing message truncation 
           or message modification and leading to session establishment failure.
</li>
<li>Attacks during the peering establishment: DoS attacks could take place during states synchronization between the          AN and the NAS. Also, man-in-the-middle attack could take place through messages modification during identity 
          discovery that may lead to loss of contact between the AN and the NAS.
</li>
<li>Attacks during capabilities negotiation: Messages replay could take place leading to DoS. Also, 
          man-in-the-middle attack could take place leading to message modification, message truncation, or 
          downgrading through advertising lesser capabilities.

Dynamic Access Loop Attributes</h3>

<p>This use case concerns the communication of access loop attributes for dynamic access
          line topology discovery. Since the access loop rate may change overtime, advertisement is
          beneficial to the NAS to gain knowledge about the topology of the access network for QoS
          scheduling. Besides data rates and access loop links identification, other information may also be transferred
          from the AN to the NAS (examples in case of DSL access loop are: DSL Type, Maximum achievable data rate, and 
          maximum data rate configured for the access loop). This use case is thus vulnerable to a number of on-path and 
          off-path attacks that can be either active or passive.
</p>
<p>On-path attacks can take place between the AN and the NAS, on the AN or on the NAS during the access loop attributes
           transfer. These attacks may be:</p>
<ul class="text">
<li> Active, acting on the transferred attributes and injecting falsified packets. The main attacks here are:
<ul class="text">
<li> Man-in-the-middle attack can cause access loop attributes transfer between the AN and a forged NAS or 
            a forged AN and the NAS which can directly cause faked attributes and message modification or truncation.
</li>
<li> Signaling replay, by an attacker between the AN and the NAS, on the AN or on the NAS itself, causing DoS.
</li>
<li> An adversary acting as man-in-the-middle can cause downgrading through changing the access loop actual data 
            rate, which impacts the downstream shaping from the NAS.
</li>
</ul>
	
</li>
<li>Passive, only learning these attributes. The main attacks here are caused by:

Access Loop Configuration</h3>

<p>This use case concerns the dynamic local loop line configuration through allowing the NAS
          to change the access loop parameters (e.g. rate) in a dynamic fashion. This allows for
          centralized subcriber-related service data. This dynamic configuration can be achieved for
          instance through profiles that are pre-configured on ANs. This use case is vulnerable to
          a number of on-path and off-path attacks.
</p>
<p>On-path attacks can take place, where the attacker is between the AN and the NAS, is on the AN, or is on the 
         NAS. These can be as follows:</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Active attacks, taking the following forms:
<ul class="text">
<li>DoS attacks of the AN can take place by an attacker, through replaying of the Configure Request messages.
</li>
<li>Damaging clients' profiles at ANs can take place by hackers that gained control on the network through discovery         of users information from a previous Traffic Analysis.
</li>
<li>An adversary can replay old packets, modify messages, or inject faked messages.  Such adversary can also be a 
          man-in-the-middle.  These attack forms can be related to a privileged client profile (having more services), so 
          that to configure this profile on the adversary's own DSL line which is less privileged.  In order that the 
          attacker does not expose its identity, he may also use these attack forms related to the privileged client 
          profile to configure a number of illegitimate DSL lines. The adversary can also force other configuration 
          parameters than the selected ones leading to for instance downgrading the service for a privileged client.
</li>
</ul>
	
</li>
<li>Passive attacks, where the attacker listens to the ANCP messages. This can take place as follows:
<ul class="text">
<li>Learning configuration attributes is possible during the update of the access loop configuration. An adversary
          might profit to see the configuration that someone else gets (e.g. one ISP might be interested

Remote Connectivity Test</h3>

<p>In this use case, the NAS can carryout Remote Connectivity Test using ANCP to initiate an
          access loop test between the AN and the HGW. Thus, multiple access loop technologies can
          be supported. This use case is vulnerable to a number of active attacks. Most of the
          attacks in this use case concern the network operation.
</p>
<p>On-path active attacks can take place in the following forms:</p>
<ul class="text">
<li> Man-in-the-middle attack during the NAS triggering to the AN to carryout the test, where an adversary can

Multicast</h3>

<p>In this use case, ANCP could be used in exchanging information between the AN and the NAS
          allowing the AN to perform replication inline with the policy and configuration of the
          subscriber. Also, this allows the NAS to follow subscribers' multicast (source, group)
          membership and control replication performed by the AN. Four multicast uses cases are expected to take place, 
          making use of ANCP protocol, these are typically: multicast conditional access, multicast admission control, 
          multicast accounting, and multicast termination. This section gives a high-level description of the 
          possible attacks that can take place in this case. Attacks that can occur are mostly active attacks.
</p>
<p> On-path active attacks can be as follows:</p>
<ul class="text">
<li> DoS attacks, causing certain subscribers inability to access particular multicast streams, or only
               access the multicast stream at a reduced bandwidth impacting the quality of the possible video 
               stream. This can take place through messages replay by an attacker between the AN and the NAS, on the AN 
               or on the NAS. Such DoS attacks can also be done by tempering, for instance, with White/Black list 
               configuration or by placing attacks to the bandwidth admission control mechanism.
</li>
<li>Man-in-the-middle causing messages' exchange between the AN and a forged NAS or a forged AN and 
          the NAS. This can lead to the following:
<ul class="text">
<li>Messages' modification, which can cause services' downgrading for legitimate subscriber, as for 
                instance, an illegitimate change of a subscriber's policy.
</li>
<li>Messages truncation between the AN and the NAS, which can result in service's non continuity.
</li>
<li>Messages replay between the AN and the NAS, on the AN or on the NAS leading to a DoS or services' fraud.
</li>
<li>Messages' modifications to temper with accounting information, for example in order to avoid service 
               charges or conversely in order to artificially increase service charges on other users. 
</li>
</ul>
	
</li>
</ul><p>
        
</p>
<p> An off-path active attack is as follows:</p>
<ul class="text">
<li> DoS could take place through message replay of join/leave requests by the HGW or CPE, frequently triggering 
            the ANCP protocol activity between the AN and the NAS. DoS could also result from generating heaps of IGMP
            join/leaves by the HGW or CPE, leading to very high rate of ANCP query/response.

Security Requirements</h3>

<p>This section presents a number of requirements motivated by the different types of attacks defined 
         in the previous section. These requirements are as follows:</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The protocol solution MUST offer authentication of the AN to the NAS.
</li>
<li>The protocol solution MUST offer authentication of the NAS to the AN.
</li>
<li>The protocol solution MUST allow authorization to take place at the NAS and the AN.
</li>
<li>The protocol solution MUST offer replay protection.
</li>
<li>The protocol solution MUST provide data origin authentication.
</li>
<li>The protocol solution MUST be robust against denial of service (DoS) attacks. In this context, the protocol 
             solution MUST consider a specific mechansim for the DoS that the user might create by sending many IGMP 
             messages.
</li>
<li>The protocol solution SHOULD offer confidentiality protection.
</li>
<li>The protocol solution SHOULD ensure that operations in default configuration guarantees low level
             of AN/NAS protocol interactions.
</li>
</ul>
