                 IPv6 Router Alert Option for MPLS OAM
                    draft-raza-mpls-oam-ipv6-rao-01

Abstract

   RFC4379 defines the MPLS LSP Ping/Traceroute mechanism, in which the
   Router Alert option must be set in the IP header of the MPLS Echo
   Request messages, and may conditionally be set in the IP header of
   the MPLS Echo Reply messages.  While a generic "Router shall examine
   packet" Option Value is used for the IPv4 Router Alert Option (RAO),
   there is no generic Router Alert Option Value defined for IPv6 that
   can be used.  This document allocates a new generic IPv6 Router Alert
   Option Value that can be used by MPLS OAM tools, including the MPLS
   Echo Request and MPLS Echo Reply messages for MPLS IPv6.

   The initial motivation to request an IPv6 Router Alert Option (RAO)
   code point for MPLS OAM comes from MPLS LSP Ping/Traceroute.
   However, this codepoint is applicable to all MPLS OAM and not limited
   to MPLS LSP Ping/Traceroute.

1.  Introduction

   A commonly deployed MPLS OAM tool is LSP Ping/Traceroute [RFC4379]
   which is used to diagnose MPLS networks.  The LSP Ping/Traceroute
   specification [RFC4379] requires the use of Router Alert option in
   the IP header.  For example, the section 4.3 of [RFC4379] states that
   IP Router Alert option MUST be set in the IP header of an MPLS Echo
   Request message.  Similarly, the section 4.5 states that IP Router
   Alert option MUST be set in the IP header of an MPLS Echo Reply
   message if the Reply Mode in the echo request is set to "Reply via an
   IPv4/IPv6 UDP packet with Router Alert".

   [RFC2113] defines a generic Option Value 0x0 for IPv4 Router Alert
   Option (RAO) that is used by LSP Ping and LSP Traceroute for MPLS
   IPv4.  However, currently there is no generic IPV6 Router Alert code
   point defined that can be used by LSP Ping and LSP Traceroute for
   MPLS IPv6.  Specifically, [RFC2711] defined the router alert for a
   general IPv6 purpose but required the Value field in the router alert
   option to indicate a specific reason for using the router alert
   option.  Because there is no defined value for MPLS LSP Ping/

   Traceroute use or for general use, it is not possible for MPLS OAM
   tools to use the IPv6 Router Alert mechanism.

   As vendors are starting to implement MPLS on IPv6 control plane
   (e.g., [I-D.ietf-mpls-ldp-ipv6]), there is a need to define and
   allocate such a code point for IPv6 in order to comply with
   [RFC4379].  This document defines a new IPv6 Router Alert Option
   Value that can be used by MPLS OAM tools, including the MPLS Echo
   Request and MPLS Echo Reply messages for MPLS IPv6.

2.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  IPv6 Router Alert Option (RAO) Value for MPLS OAM

   This document defines a new option value (TBD1) for the IPv6 Router
   Alert Option (RAO) to alert transit routers to examine the packet
   more closely for MPLS OAM purposes.  This code point is used by any
   MPLS OAM application that requires their packets to be examined by a
   transit router.

   In the scope of this document, this code point will be used by the
   MPLS Echo Request and MPLS Echo Reply for its IPv6 messages as
   required by [RFC4379].

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new code point (value TBD1) for IPv6 Router
   Alert option to alert transit routers to examine the packet the MPLS
   OAM purpose.  IANA is requested to assign a new code point under its
   "IPv6 Router Alert Option Values" registry defined by [RFC5350] and
   maintained in [IANA-IPv6-RAO].  The new code point is as follows:

      value   Description                       Reference
      -----   -------------------------------   ---------------
       TBD1   MPLS OAM                          [document.this]

5.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces no new security concerns in addition to what
   have already been captured in [RFC4379] and [RFC6398].
