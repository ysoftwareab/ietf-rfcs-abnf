1.  Introduction

   Modern top-level domain registries provide many detailed reports and
   documents that their registrars require on a daily, weekly and
   monthly basis. These most commonly include transaction reports, as
   well as lists containing currently unavailable domains and current
   premium domain fees. These reports are critical for registrars'
   businesses and play an important role in accounting and operations
   processes as well as in sales and marketing activities. In the
   current set-up, registrars must download these reports from each
   registry's intranet differently according to each registry's document
   management set up.

   This document describes a Reporting Repository used to provide
   standardized Reports.

2.  Terminology and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] when
   specified in their uppercase forms.

Internet-Draft               Reporting Repository           October 2019
   
2.1.  Internationalized Domain Names

   Top-level domains and domain names contained in a directory or file
   name MUST be written as A-LABEL according to [RFC5890].

2.2.  Dates and Times

   All dates and times attribute values MUST be expressed in Universal
   Coordinated Time (UTC) using the Gregorian calendar. The extended
   date-time form using upper case "T" and "Z" characters defined in ISO
   8601 [RFC3339] MUST be used to represent date-time values.
   
   One day is defined as one day in UTC+0. Therefore, months and years
   will also be calculated on this basis.

3.  SFTP Server

   Each domain name registry sets up and manages an SFTP
   (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_File_Transfer_Protocol) server.
   Every SFTP server MUST be reachable through a generic URI, such as
   sftp://registry.example, and MUST listen on port 22.
   
   IP whitelisting to reach this SFTP server is RECOMMENDED.

4.  SFTP Account

   Each domain name registry MUST create one SFTP account for every
   accredited domain name registrar. If a registrar owns more than one
   registrar, then a registry SHOULD combine them in one account on
   request by the parent registrar or entity.

   The authentication for an SFTP account should be done with an
   username and key instead of a password.
   
   To avoid security risks, it is strongly RECOMMENDED to limit SFTP
   accounts to SFTP only and to exclude them from SSH functions, such as
   port forwarding, tunneling, SSH login or command execution.

5.  SFTP Directory Structure

   The home directory of an SFTP user MUST be its root. This can be
   achieved with, e.g. chroot (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot) and
   prevents that an SFTP user can access other directories that are not
   owned by themselves. All directories MUST be lowercase.

   Files in these directories MUST be stored in an appropriate
   subdirectory according to their creation date.

   /YYYY-MM/example.csv.gz
   /YYYY-MM/domains/example.csv.gz
   /YYYY-MM/foo/bar/example.csv.gz

   YYYY  represents the year in which the file was created, format
         according to ISO 8601 [RFC3339]

   MM    represents the months in which the file was created, format
         according to ISO 8601 [RFC3339]

6.  SFTP Checksum

   All files stored on the SFTP server MUST have a sha256sum 
   (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sha1sum) checksum.

   The file name with the checksum MUST be the same as the file name
   with the content extended with the suffix .sha256.

   File with content:   example.csv.gz
   File with sha256sum: example.csv.gz.sha256

7.  SFTP Server Maintenance

   Maintenance is important and necessary, mainly to keep the SFTP
   server up to date and secure. It MUST be announced in advance. In
   this case the EPP registry maintenance specification
   [I-D.sattler-epp-registry-maintenance] is RECOMMENDED to use. The
   notification notice MUST be sent at least 7 days in advance.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

9.  Security Considerations

   The registry reporting repository described in this document does not
   provide any security services beyond those specified by SFTP. The
   security considerations described in these other specifications apply
   to this specification as well.

10.  Implementation Status

   Note to RFC Editor: Please remove this section and the reference to
   [RFC7942] before publication.

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [RFC7942], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature. It
   is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".
