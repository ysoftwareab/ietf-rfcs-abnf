Abstract

   This document describes the use cases, requirements, and
   considerations that should be factored in the design of a successor
   protocol to supercede version 4 of the NTP protocol [RFC5905]
   presently referred to as NTP version 5 ("NTPv5").  This document is
   non-exhaustive and does not in its current version represent working
   group consensus.

1.  Introduction

   NTP version 4 [RFC5905] has seen active use for over a decade, and
   within this time period the protocol has not only been extended to
   support new requirements but also fallen victim to vulnerabilities
   that have made it used for distributed denial of service (DDoS)
   amplification attacks.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Use cases and existing deployments of NTP

   There are several common scenarios for exxisting NTPv4 deployments;
   publicly accessible NTP services such as the NTP Pool [ntppool] are
   used to offer clock synchronisation for end users and embedded
   devices, ISP provided servers to synchronise devices such as
   customer-premesis equipment where reduced accuracy may be tollerable.
   Depending on the network and path these deployments may be affected
   by variable latency as well as throttling or blocking by providers.

   Data centres and cloud computing providers also have deployed and
   offer NTP services both for internal use and for customers,
   particularly where the network is unable to offer or does not require
   PTP [IEEE-1588-2008].  As these deployments are less likely to be
   constrained by network latency or power the potential for higher
   levels of accuracy and precision within the bounds of the protocol
   are possible.

3.  Requirements

   At a high level, NTPv5 should be a protocol that is capable of
   operating in both local networks and also over public internet
   connections where packet loss, delay, and even filtering may occur.

   Timestamp resolution SHOULD either match or exceed NTPv4, and be
   extensible to represent any specified timescale.

   The protocol SHOULD NOT transmit time zone information and should
   focus on providing clock synchronisation as TZDIST [RFC7808] already
   provides this ability.

3.1.  IP affinity

   Servers SHOULD have a new identifier that peers use as reference,
   this SHOULD NOT be a FQDN, an IP address, or identifier tied to a
   certificate.  Servers SHOULD be able to migrate and change their
   identifiers as stratum topologies or network configuration changes
   occur.

   Clients SHOULD re-establish connections with servers at an interval
   to prevent attempting to maintain connectivity to dead host and give
   network operators the ability to move traffic away from IP addresses
   in a timely manner.  This functionality should also compliment having
   a "Kiss of Death" or similar message from servers.

3.2.  Algorithms

   Algorithms describing functions such as clock filtering, selection
   and clustering SHOULD be omitted from the specification; the
   specification should instead only provide only what is necessary to
   describe protocol semantics and normative behaviours.

   The working group should consider creating a separate informational
   document to describe an algorithm to assist with implementation, and
   to consider adopting future documents which describe new algorithms
   as they are developed.  Specifying client algorithms separately from
   the protocol allows will allow NTPv5 to meet the needs of
   applications with a variety of network properties and performance
   requirements.  It also allows for innovation in implementations
   without sacrificing basic interoperability.

3.3.  Timescales

   Support SHOULD be available for other timescales in addition to UTC -
   this should include, but not limited to the use of TAI or Modified
   Julian Date as defined in [I-D.ietf-ntp-roughtime], however UTC SHALL
   be the default timescale and MUST be supported by all
   implementations.  Consideration should be made to include listing the
   supported timescales either as part of specific IANA parameter
   registry, or as part of the extension registry.

3.4.  Leap seconds

   The specification or the protocol SHOULD be explicit about when a
   leap second is being applied, and the protocol should allow for
   transmiting an upcoming leap second ahead of the day it is to be
   applicable.  Nevertheless, due to network delays and the polling
   interval, applications with NTP clients will need to manage the leap
   second event at their local clock.

3.4.1.  Leap second smearing

   Server responses SHOULD include not only an indicator as to wether
   the server supports smearing, but also if the current time being
   transmitted is smeared.  The protocol may also transmit the start/end
   or duration of the smearing ahead of time.  It MUST be possible for
   clients to determine the unsmeared time of the timescale.

3.5.  Backwards compatibility to NTS and NTPv4

   The support for compatibility with other protocols SHOULD NOT prevent
   addressing issues that have previous caused issues in deployments or
   cause ossification of the protocol.  Protocol ossification MUST be

Internet-Draft      NTPv5 use cases and requirements       December 2020


   addressed to prevent existing NTPv4 deployments which incorrectly
   respond to clients posing as NTPv5 from causing issues.  Forward
   prevention of ossification (for a potential NTPv6 protocol in the
   future) SHOULD also be taken into consideration.

   The model for backward compatibility is servers that support mutliple
   versions NTP and send a response in the same version as the request.
   This does not preclude high stratum servers from acting as a client
   in one version of NTP and a server in another.

3.6.  Extensibility

   To provide the protocol MUST have the capability to be extended.  The
   specification should specify that implementations MUST ignore unknown
   extensions.  Unknown extensions received by a server from a lower
   stratum server SHALL not be added to response messages sent by the
   server receiving these extensions.

4.  IANA Considerations

   Considerations should be made about the future of the existing IANA
   registry for NTPv4 parameters.  If NTPv5 becomes incompatible with
   these parameters a new registry SHOULD be created.

5.  Security Considerations

   Encryption and authentication MUST be provided by the protocol
   specification as a default and MUST be resistent to downgrade
   attacks.  The encryption used must have agility, allowing for the
   protocol to update as more secure cryptography becomes known and
   vulnerabilities are discovered.

   The specification MAY consider leaving room for middleboxes which may
   deliberately modify packets in flight for legitimate purposes.
   Thought must be given around how this will be incorporated into any
   applicable trust model.  Downgrading attacks that could lead to an
   adversary disabling or removing encryption or authentication MUST NOT
   be possible in the design of the protocol.

   Detection and reporting of server malfeasence SHOULD remain out of
   scope of this specification as [I-D.ietf-ntp-roughtime] already
   provides this capability as a core functionality of the protocol.
