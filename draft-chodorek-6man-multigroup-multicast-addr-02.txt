1. Introduction

   Multimedia services can use multiple multicast streams [ITU2009]
   which form one multicast session. These services have been provided
   using several multicast groups or one multicast group and user level
   filtering. For services which have been provided using several
   multicast groups this document introduces the new class of IPv6
   multicast addresses called "multiple multicast". We define a
   multiple multicast as a set of multicast addresses belonging to one
   multicast session. Multicast addresses which belong to the one
   multiple multicast address follow the same multicast tree. It allows
   for identical propagation parameters for each transmitted stream
   belonging to one multicast session. It also simplifies multicast
   routing and the management of multiple multicast streams.

   The new class of IPv6 multicast addresses expands the current IPv6
   multicast addressing architecture [RFC4291].

3. Multiple multicast addressing

   The new class of IPv6 multicast addresses expands the unicast-
   prefix-based IPv6 multicast address [RFC7371][RFC3306].

   The group ID is divided into two fields (Figure 1). The first one is
   session ID (20 bits). The second one is stream ID (12 bits).

   |   8    |  4 |  4 |  4 |  4 |   8  |    64   |   20    |   12   |
   +--------+----+----+----+----+------+---------+---------+--------+
   |11111111|ff1 |scop|ff2 |rsvd| plen | network | session | stream |
   |        |    |    |    |    |      | prefix  | ID      | ID     |
   +--------+----+----+----+----+------+---------+---------+--------+

                                                  +-+-+-+-+
   ff2 (flag field 2) is a set of 4 flags:        |r|r|G|r|
                                                  +-+-+-+-+

   where:

   o "r" bits is for future assignment and MUST each be set to 0,

   o G = 1 indicates a multigroup multicast address.

   The new class of IPv6 addresses will be indicated by bit G in the
   ff2 (flag field 2). If a new multicast session is created a new
   session ID is generated. If within the specified session a new
   stream is required then a new stream ID is generated.

   A value of 0 is reserved for the field session ID. There is also a
   value of 0 reserved for the field stream ID.

4. Usage of multiple multicast addressing

   There are two main benefits to using multiple multicast addressing:
   multimedia layered multicast (hierarchical coding) and multimedia
   conference systems [ITU2009]. It is also possible to use the
   proposed addressing scheme in large multicast multimedia streaming
   services. This addressing scheme simplifies multicast routing and
   the management of multiple multicast streams.

4.1. Multimedia layered multicast

   A multimedia layered multicast hierarchically encodes multimedia
   content into complementary layers and these are transmitted through
   the network as separate multicast groups. Using the new addressing
   scheme if a sender wants to send a layered multicast to recipients
   they must first allocate a new session ID for all streams (layers).
   Each layer is allocated a new stream ID. In a typical allocation
   scheme for layered transmission the base layer will have the stream
   ID set to a value of 1.

4.2. Multimedia conference systems

   For the multimedia content of a conference two (audio, video) or
   more (audio, video and additional data) multicast streams will be
   created. Each of the conference participants will have one session
   ID created and for each stream a stream ID is allocated. Typically:
   base audio stream ID = 1, video stream ID = 2 and additional data
   will have stream IDs with higher numbers.

4.3. Multiple content from the one sender

   One IPTV service platform operator can sends multiple TV streams. In
   IPTV SSM multicast is desired. According to [RFC 3306] the SSM
   address sets plen = 0 and sets network prefix = 0. In the proposed
   addressing scheme for all transmitted content the service provider
   allocates the session ID. For each TV stream the service provider
   allocates one or more stream IDs.

4.4. Routers

   Routers must recognize multiple multicast addressing. For each
   session ID the router builds one common delivery tree. If a user
   wants to receive a new stream with a selected stream ID the router
   must enable forwarding for it. If a user does not need a specified
   stream the router must disable the stream for the specified stream
   ID.

5. Security Considerations

   The same security considerations as those discussed in [RFC3306] are
   to be taken into account.
