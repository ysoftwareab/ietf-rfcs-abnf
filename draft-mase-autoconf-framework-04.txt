Abstract

   We consider the unique address/prefix autoconfiguration problem for
   MANETs.  Specifically, we consider two cases.  First, a node without
   a pre-assigned and valid local address/prefix acquires a new local
   address/prefix and becomes a member of a new or existing MANET.
   Second, two or more MANETs merge.  In the first case, a mechanism of
   IP address/prefix generation is needed.  We may have MANET-wide
   duplicate address/prefix detection (DAD) on newly generated address/
   prefix (tentative address/prefix) for suppressing occurrence of
   address/prefix conflict with existing address/prefixes (pre-service
   DAD).  In the second case, duplicate address/prefix may occur as the
   result of a merger of two formerly independent networks.  We may have
   DAD on addresses/prefixes in use for detecting and resolving
   duplicate addresses/prefixes and suppressing routing information
   contamination due to existence of duplicate addresses/prefixes (in-
   service DAD).  To define pre-service DAD and in-service DAD, we use
   autoconfiguration phases that are common for both proactive and
   reactive routing protocol.  Each node exists in one of the
   autoconfiguration phases at any time.  A node, that detects duplicate
   address/prefix between other nodes, may advertise the detected
   duplicate address/prefix to all other nodes in the MANET.  This is
   termed "Duplicate address/prefix advertisement" (DAA).  The specific
   DAD and DAA algorithm is beyond the scope of this document.

1.  Introduction

   This document discusses autoconfiguration of local address/prefix for
   MANETs[5].  Autoconfiguration methods are generally classified into
   stateless and stateful methods.  Conventional statefull and stateless
   autoconfiguration methods cannot be used for MANETs, since such
   networks do not depend on a central server and multihop communication
   is involved.  A number of autoconfiguration solutions to prevent
   address/prefix conflict have been proposed for MANETs [6]-[22].  Some
   of these proposals discuss MANET-wide duplicated address/prefix
   detection (DAD) only in initial address/prefix generation and do not
   discuss potential occurrence of address/prefix conflict when network
   mergers occur.  Some of these proposals discuss DAD to deal with
   address/prefix conflict in case of a merger.  The aim of this
   document is not to provide another solution for the MANET
   autoconfiguration problem, but to give a common framework, that may
   be useful for designing solutions regardless of wether the underlying
   routing protocol is proactive or reactive.  We also consider the
   necessity and benefits of advertising duplicate addresses/prefixes to
   other nodes in the MANET, that is termed "Duplicate address/prefix
   advertisement" (DAA).

   A functionality and mechanism of "Duplicate address/prefix
   detection(DAD)" for link-local address/prefix are defined in the
   traditional IETF terms-RFC(2461/2462) [2] and [3].  The mechanisms
   defined in this document, i.e., "pre-service DAD" is identical in
   functionality (but not mechanism) to DAD, and "in-service DAD" is
   similar to functionality (but not mechanism),that is used in [4],
   necessary for MANETs.

2.  Terminology

2.1.  General

   This section provides definitions for terms that have a specific
   meaning to the protocol specified in this document and that are used
   throughout the text.  Some fundamental definitions are taken from
   [2], [3].

   IP - Internet Protocol Version 4 or 6.

   node  - a MANET router.

   link  - a communication facility or medium over which nodes can
      communicate at the link layer, i.e., the layer immediately below
      IP.

   interface  - a node's attachment to a link.

   neighbors  - nodes attached to the same link.

   address/prefix  - an IP-layer identifier for an interface.

   local address/prefix  - a local address/prefix having scope that is
      limited to the MANET.

   tentative address/prefix  - an address/prefix whose uniqueness in a
      MANET is being verified, prior to its assignment to an interface.
      A tentative address/prefix is not considered assigned to an
      interface in the usual sense.  An interface discards received
      packets addressed to a tentative address/prefix, but accepts
      routing control packets related to MANET-wide Duplicate Address/
      prefix Detection for the tentative address/prefix.

   address/prefix generation  - Adress generation is a procedure for a
      node, that has currently no address/prefix, to obtain a tentative
      address/prefix in the MANET -either of its own accord or with
      support of other nodes.

   address/prefix conflict  - When two nodes in the same MANET network
      share the same address/prefix or tentative address/prefix, the
      situation is described as an "Address/prefix Conflict".  The nodes
      involved are "conflicting nodes" and their shared address/prefix
      is called the "conflicting address/prefix".

   MANET-wide Duplicate Address/prefix Detection (DAD)  - MANET-wide
      Duplicate address/prefix detection is the action of detecting
      address/prefix conflict in the MANET, the situation where some
      nodes are going to use or using the same address/prefix in the
      same MANET network.

   pre-service DAD  - Pre-service DAD is the procedure to verify that a
      tentative address/prefix is out of address/prefix conflict with
      other MANET nodes.

   in-service DAD  - In-service DAD is the procedure to continuously
      verify that a used address/prefix is out of address/prefix
      conflict with other MANET nodes.

   DAA  - DAA is the procedure for a node, that detects duplicate
      address/prefix between other nodes, to advertise the duplicate
      address/prefix to all other nodes.

   autoconfiguration phase  - The current autoconfiguration phase of the
      node, one of NO ADDRESS, ADVERTISING and NORMAL, which indicates
      what messages it should (or should not) generate and what
      processing it should (or should not) do.

   routing information contamination  - Erroneous updates of routing
      information due to address/prefix conflict.

2.2.  Requirements

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [1].

3.  Autoconfiguration framework

3.1.  Overview

   We consider the local address/prefix autoconfiguration problem for
   MANETs.  Specifically, we consider two cases.

   -  In the first case, a node without a pre-assigned address/prefix
      acquires an address/prefix and becomes a member of a new or
      existing MANET.

   -  In the second case, two or more MANETs merge.

   For the first case, a mechanism of address/prefix generation is
   needed, and a number of address/prefix generation methods have been
   proposed in literature.  These are classified into stateful and
   stateless methods.  In this case, a node first obtains an address/
   prefix (tentative address/prefix) using a proper address/prefix
   generation method, - be that either a stateful or stateless method.
   It then verifies that the tentative address/prefix is not part of an
   address/prefix conflict with (not currently used by) other nodes.
   This procedure is termed "pre-service DAD" in this document.  We MAY
   have pre-service DAD on a tentative address/prefix for suppressing
   occurrence of duplicate address/prefixes in the address/prefix
   assignment regardless of whether stateful or stateless methods is
   employed.  Note that the necessity of pre-service DAD for MANETs with
   reactive routing protocol has been well known [8] and this method can
   be applied to MANETs with proactive routing protocol.  In this case,
   however, existing nodes in the MANET must process control messages,
   specific for pre-service DAD, in addition to those for routing,
   giving rise to additional overhead.  A pre-service DAD function
   SHOULD be embeded in routing control messages for MANETs, regardless
   of whether reactive or proactive routing protocol is employed to
   minimize the overhead [7].

   In the second case, two or more already configured MANETs merge
   resulting address/prefix conflict.  To cope with this situation, a
   node in an existing MANET MAY continuously verify possible address/
   prefix conflict with other MANET nodes.  This procedure is termed
   "in-service DAD" in this document.  "Weak DAD" [14] and "passive DAD"
   [6] are examples of in-service DAD.  When an address/prefix conflict
   is detected, a node with a duplicate address/prefix MUST obtain a new
   address/prefix to resolve the address/prefix conflict.  This is
   accomplished using the address/prefix generation mentioned before.
   During duplicate address/prefix detection and resolution, some nodes
   may share the same address/prefix transiently and, therefore, routing
   information may not be correctly maintained.  Specifically, a route
   entry may erroneously be updated based on control messages including

Internet-Draft                  Framework                 September 2007


   information from different nodes with the same duplicate address/
   prefix.  We call this problem "routing information contamination".
   We MAY have in-service DAD for detecting duplicate addresses/prefixes
   as well as for suppressing routing information contamination due to
   existence of duplicate addresses/prefixes.  To systematically define
   pre-service DAD and in-service DAD, we use autoconfiguration phases
   that are common for both proactive and reactive routing protocols
   [7].  Each node is in one of the autoconfiguration phases at any
   time.  Specific pre-service and in-service DAD algorithms are beyond
   the scope of this document.

   In either case, a node, that detects address/prefix conflict between
   other nodes, MAY advertise the detected duplicate address/prefix
   throughout the MANET.  This is termed "Duplicate address/prefix
   advertisement" (DAA).  As the results, a node with duplicate address/
   prefix becomes aware of the address/prefix conflict and can start an
   action to resolve the conflict.  Other nodes can take an action to
   suppress routing information contamination.  DAA function should be
   embeded in routing control messages for MANETs regardless of whether
   reactive or proactive routing protocol is employed to minimize the
   overhead.

   In summary, the baselines of this framework are as follows:

   -  Each node MAY perform "pre-service DAD" and "in-service DAD",
      before and after address/prefix assignment, respectively.

   -  A node, that detects duplicate address/prefix between other nodes,
      MAY perform "DAA".

   -  Pre-service and in-service DAD and DAA functions could be embedded
      in routing control messages regardless of whether reactive or
      proactive routing protocol is employed.

   With regard to the first baseline above, pre-service DAD is useful to
   suppress occurrences of an address/prefix conflict and in-service DAD
   is useful to suppress occurrences of address/prefix conflict and the
   resulting possible routing information contamination in case of
   network mergers.  To define pre-service and in-service DAD
   systematically, we use the concept of autoconfiguration phases.  The
   second baseline is useful to speed up duplicated address/prefix
   detection at the nodes with duplicate address/prefix.  It is also
   useful for other nodes to keep its routing table correctly.  The
   third baseline is useful to reduce pre-service DAD, in-service DAD
   and DAA overhead and to allow inter-working between nodes performing
   pre-service DAD and those performing in-service DAD when they
   coexist.

3.2.  Autoconfiguration phases

   This section proposes a high-level conceptual view of generic MANET
   autoconfiguration.  The different phases of the autoconfiguration
   process are abstracted by means of diagrams (Fig. 1 - 4), that
   propose different approaches to the process of autoconfiguration,
   which can be applied in different scenarios.  The purpose of this
   framework is to derive a checklist of autoconfiguration
   functionalities, in order to build solutions taylored for different
   scenarios.

   The NO ADDRESS phase -   In this phase a node does not have its own
      IP address/prefix.  It does not participate in user data
      forwarding.  If a routing protocol is in use in the MANET, the
      router does not process, generate or forward routing control
      messages generated by other nodes.  At some point, the router MAY
      generate a (tentative) address/prefix by means of a given address/
      prefix generation method.  When it generates its address/prefix,
      the node should enter the ADVERTISING phase.

   The ADVERTISING phase -   In this phase, a node does not participate
      in user data forwarding.  If a routing protocol is in use in the
      MANET, the router does not forward routing control messages
      generated by other routers.  In this phase, the router MAY perform
      pre-service DAD by means of a given mechanism (for instance by
      using specific control signalling, that could be embeded in the ad
      hoc routing signalling in use).  If pre-service DAD is used, and
      the node detects that its tentative address/prefix creates a
      conflict with other MANET nodes, it should re-enters the NO
      ADDRESS phase.  Else, if pre-service DAD completes without any
      address/prefix conflict being detected, or if pre-service DAD is
      not required, the router should enter the NORMAL phase.  Note that
      if pre- service DAD is used, the ADVERTISING phase MAY have
      incremental substates in order to reduce the risks of routing
      table pollution with duplicate addresses/prefixes.  In the LOCAL
      ADVERTISEMENT phase, pre- service DAD control signalling reaches
      only a TTL-limited neighborhood, whereas in the GLOBAL
      ADVERTISEMENT phase, pre- service DAD control signalling reaches
      the whole MANET.

   The NORMAL phase -   In this phase, the node participates in IP
      communication normally.  If a routing protocol is in use in the
      MANET, the node MAY process, generate or forward routing control
      messages as specified by the routing protocol in use, and MAY
      generate or forward user data.  A node in this phase MAY perform
      in-service DAD by means of a given mechanism (for instance by
      using specific control messages that can be embeded in the routing
      control messages).  If in-service DAD is used and if the node

      detects an address/prefix conflict that forces it to acquire a new
      address/prefix to resolve this conflict, the router should return
      to the NO ADDRESS phase.  Note that the phases in this model are
      cyclic, and that a router can pop up in the MANET in any phase.
      For instance, a router that beneficiated from appropriate static
      preconfiguration MAY start directly in the NORMAL phase.

   This conceptual framework reveals three specific potential aspects of
   the MANET autoconfiguration problem:

   -  The (tentative) IP addresses/prefixes generation and assignment
      aspect.

   -  The pre-service DAD aspect, to somehow ensure a reasonalble belief
      in the fact that an address/prefix about to be assigned does not
      create a conflict.

   -  The in-service DAD aspect, to deal with conflicts that are
      detected between already assigned addresses/prefixes.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document presents only framwork of autoconfiguration for MANETs
   and does therefore not specify any special security measure.
   However, introduction of autoconfiguration phases may be useful to
   realize some security measures.  For example, node authentification
   may be done during the ADVERTISING phase.
