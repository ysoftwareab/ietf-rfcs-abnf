     2  Introduction 

        DSL is a widely deployed access technology for Broadband Access for 
        Next Generation Networks. Several specifications like [1-3] describe 
        possible architectures for these access networks. In the scope of 
        these specifications are the delivery of voice, video and data 
        services. 

        When deploying value-added services across DSL access networks, 
        special attention regarding quality of service and service control is 
        required, which implies a tighter coordination between network 
        elements in the broadband access network without burdening the OSS 
        layer.  

        This draft defines extensions to GSMPv3 to be used as a control plane 
        between a service-oriented layer 3 edge device (the BRAS) and a 
        layer2 Access Node (e.g. DSLAM) in order to perform QoS-related, 
        service-related and subscriber-related operations. 

         
     3  Broadband Access Aggregation  

         
     3.1 ATM-based broadband aggregation  

        End to end DSL network consists of network and application service 
        provider networks (NSP and ASP networks), regional/access network, 
        and customer premises network. Fig 1. shows ATM broadband access 
        network components. 
      
      
     Wadhwa et.al          Expires September 28, 2006               [Page 4] 
         
     Internet-Draft      draft-wadhwa-gsmp-l2control-configuration-01        March 2006 
         

        The NSP authenticates access and provides and manages the IP address 
        to subscribers. It is responsible for overall service assurance and 
        includes internet service providers. ASP provides application 
        services to the application subscriber (gaming, video, content on 
        demand, IP telephony etc.).  

         

        The Regional/Access Network consists of the Regional Network, 
        Broadband Remote Access Server, and the Access Network as show in Fig 
        1. Its primary function is to provide end-to-end transport between 
        the customer premises and the NSP or ASP. The Regional/Access Network 
        may also provide higher layer functions such as QoS and content 
        distribution.  

        The Regional Network connects one or more BRAS and associated Access 
        Network to NSPs and ASPs. It supports aggregation of traffic from 
        multiple Access Networks and hands off larger geographic locations to 
        NSPs and ASPs – relieving a potential requirement for them to build 
        infrastructure to attach more directly to the various Access 
        Networks.   

        The Access Node terminates the DSL signal. It could consist of DSLAM 
        in the central office , or remote DSLAM, or a Remote Access 
        Multiplexer (RAM). A DSLAM hub can be used in a central office to 
        aggregate traffic from multiple remote physical devices, and is 
        considered logically to be a part of the Access Node. Access node is 
        the first point in the network where traffic on multiple DSL lines 
        will be aggregated onto a single network. In an ATM access network, 
        access Node is primarily an ATM concentrator, mapping PVCs from the 
        DSL modem to PVCs in the ATM core.  

        The BRAS performs multiple functions in the network. The BRAS is the 
        aggregation point for the subscriber traffic. It provides aggregation 
        capabilities (e.g. IP, PPP, ATM) between the Regional/Access Network 
        and the NSP or ASP. These include traditional ATM-based offerings and 
        newer, more native IP-based services. This includes support for 
        Point-to-Point Protocol over ATM (PPPoA) and PPP over Ethernet 
        (PPPoE), as well as direct IP services encapsulated over an 
        appropriate layer II transport.  

        Beyond aggregation, BRAS is also the injection point for policy 
        management and IP QoS in the Regional/Access Networks. In order to 
        allow IP QoS support over an existing non-IP-aware layer 2 access 
        network without using multiple layer 2 QoS classes, a mechanism based 
        on hierarchical scheduling is used. This mechanism defined in [1], 
        preserves IP QoS over the ATM network between the BRAS and the RGs by

        carefully controlling downstream traffic in the BRAS, so that   
        significant queuing and congestion does not occur further down the  

        ATM network. This is achieved by using a diffserv-aware hierarchical 
        scheduler in the BRAS that will account for downstream trunk 
        bandwidths and DSL synch rates. 
         
        Routing Gateway is a customer premises functional element that 
        provides IP routing and QOS capabilities. It may be integrated into 
        or be separate from the modem.

     3.2 Ethernet-based broadband aggregation  

     The Ethernet aggregation network architecture builds on the Ethernet 
     bridging/switching concepts defined in IEEE 802. The Ethernet 
     aggregation network provides traffic aggregation, class of service 
     distinction, and customer separation and traceability. VLAN tagging 
     defined in IEEE 802.1Q and being enhanced by IEEE 802.1ad is used as 
     standard virtualization mechanism in the Ethernet aggregation network. 
     The aggregation devices are “provider edge bridges” defined in IEEE 
     802.ad.  
     Stacked VLAN tags provide one possible way to create equivalent of 
     “virtual paths” and “virtual circuits” in the aggregation network. The

     Internet-Draft      draft-wadhwa-gsmp-l2control-configuration-01        March 2006 
         

     “outer” vlan could be used to create a form of “virtual path” between a 
     given DSLAM and a given BRAS. And “inner” VLAN tags to create a form of 
     “virtual circuit” on a per DSL line basis. This is 1:1 VLAN allocation 
     model. An alternative model is to bridge sessions from multiple 
     subscribers behind a DSLAM into a single VLAN in the aggregation 
     network. This is N:1 VLAN allocation model. Architectural and 
     topological models of an Ethernet aggregation network in context of DSL 
     aggregation are defined in [8].  
         

     4  Layer2 Control Protocol 

     4.1 Overview 

        There is a requirement for a control plane between service-oriented 
        layer 3 edge device (the BRAS) and a layer 2 Access Node (e.g. DSLAM)    
        in order to perform QoS-related, service-related and subscriber-
        related operations. A dedicated control protocol between BRAS and 
        access nodes can fecilitate "BRAS managed" tight QOS control in the 
        access network, simplified OSS infrastructure for service management, 
        optimized multicast replication to enable video services over DSL, 
        subscriber statistics retrieval on the BRAS for accounting purposes, 
        and fault isolation capability on the BRAS for the underlying acccess 
        technology. This document provides extensions to GSMPv3 [4] to 
        implement layer2 control protocol. 

        Following sections discuss the use of layer2 control protocol for 
        implementing: 

          . Dynamic discovery of access topology by the BRAS to provide 
             tight QOS control in the access network. 

          . Pushing to the access-nodes, subscriber and service data 
             retrieved by the BRAS from an OSS system (e.g. radius server), 
             to simplify OSS infrastructure for service management. 

          . Optimized, "BRAS controlled and managed" multicast replication 
             by access-nodes at L2 layer.  

          . BRAS controlled, on-demand access-line test capability 
             (rudimentary end-to-end OAM).    

        In addition to DSL, alternate broadband access technologies (e.g. 
        Metro-Ethernet, Passive Optical Networking, WiMax) will have similar 
        challenges to address, and could benefit from the same approach of a 
        control plane between a BRAS and an Access Node (e.g. OLT), providing 
        a unified control and management architecture for multiple access

        technologies, hence facilitating migration from one to the other 
        and/or parallel deployments.  

        GSMPv3 is an ideal fit for implementing layer2 control protocol. It 
        is extensible and can be run over TCP/IP, which makes it possible to 
        run over different access technologies. 

         

     4.2 Layer2 control for Access Topology Discovery 

     4.2.1 Goals 

        [1] discusses various queuing/scheduling mechanisms to avoid 
        congestion in the access network while dealing with multiple flows 
        with distinct QoS requirements. Such mechanisms require that the BRAS 
        gains knowledge about the topology of the access network, the various 
        links being used and their respective rates. Some of the information 
        required is somewhat dynamic in nature (e.g. DSL sync rate), hence 
        cannot come from a provisioning and/or inventory management OSS 
        system. Some of the information varies less frequently (e.g. capacity 
        of a DSLAM uplink), but nevertheless needs to be kept strictly in 
        sync between the actual capacity of the uplink and the image the BRAS 
        has of it.  

        OSS systems are rarely able to enforce in a reliable and scalable 
        manner the consistency of such data, notably across organizational 
        boundaries. Dynamic and automated discovery of the access network 
        topology would help to address these issues, notably when performed 
        by an interoperable and standardized protocol. Following section 
        describes GSMPv3 messages that allow the Access Node (e.g. DSLAM) to 
        communicate to the BRAS, access network topology information and any 
        corresponding updates.  

        Some of the parameters that can be communicated from the DSLAM to the 
        BRAS include DSL line state, actual upstream and downstream data 
        rates of a synchronized DSL link, maximum attainable upstream and 
        downstream data rates, interleaving delay etc. Topology discovery is 
        specifically important in case the net data rate of the DSL line 
        changes over time. The DSL net data rate may be different every time 
        the DSL modem is turned on. Additionally, during the time the DSL 
        modem is active, data rate changes can occur due to environmental 
        conditions (the DSL line can get "out of sync" and can retrain to a 
        lower value.

     4.2.2 Message Flow - GSMP mapping 

     When a DSL line initially comes up or resynchronizes to a different 
     rate, the DSLAM generates and transmits a GSMP PORT UP EVENT message to     
     the BRAS. The extension field in the message carries the TLVs containing 
     DSL line specific parameters. On a loss of signal on the DSL line, a    
     GSMP PORT DOWN message is generated by the DSLAM to the BRAS. In order 
     to provide expected service level, BRAS needs to learn the initial     
     attributes of the DSL line before the subscriber can log in and access 
     the provisioned services for the subscriber.

        The Event message with PORT UP message type (80) is used for 
        conveying DSL line attributes to the BRAS. The format of extensions 
        to the message is defined in section 5.4.1.

     4.3 Layer2 control for Line Configuration 

     4.3.1 Goals 

        Following dynamic discovery of access topology (identification of DSL 
        line and it's attributes) as assisted by the mechanism described    
        in the previous section (topology discovery), the BRAS could then 
        query a subscriber management OSS system (e.g. RADIUS server) to     
        retrieve subscriber authorization data (service profiles, aka user 
        entitlement). Most of such service mechanisms are typically enforced     
        by the BRAS itself, but there are a few cases where it might be 
        useful to push such service parameter to the DSLAM for local 
        enforcement of a mechanism (e.g. DSL-related) on the corresponding 
        subscriber line. One such example of a service parameter that can be 
        pushed to the DSLAM for local enforcement is DSL "interleaving 
        delay". Longer interleaving delay (and hence stringent error 
        correction) is required for a video service to ensure better video 
        "quality of experience", whereas for a VoIP service or for "shoot 
        first" gaming service, a very short interleaving delay is more 
        appropriate. Another relevant application is downloading per 
        subscriber multicast channel entitlement information in IPTV 
        applications where the DSLAM is performing IGMP snooping or IGMP 
        proxy function. Using GSMP, the BRAS could achieve the goal of 
        pushing line configuration to the DSLAM by an interoperable and 
        standardized protocol.  

        If a subscriber wants to choose a different service, it can require 
        an OPEX intensive reconfiguration of the line via a network operator, 
        possibly implying a business-to-business transaction between an ISP 
        and an access provider. Using L2C for line configuration from the 
        BRAS dramatically simplifies the OSS infrastructure for service 
        management, allowing fully centralized subscriber-related service 
        data (e.g. RADIUS server back-end) and avoiding complex cross-
        organization B2B interactions.  

        Therefore, proposed GSMP based line configuration support provides 
        for more flexible approach for achieving "service on demand". More 
        generally several service/subscriber DSL parameters (e.g. inter-
        leaving delay, rate etc.) could benefit from such flexible approach 
        to enable a "service on demand" model.  

        The best way to change line parameters would be by using profiles. 
        These profiles (DSL profiles for different services) are pre-
        configured on the DSLAMs. The BRAS can then indicate a reference to 
        the right DSL profile via GSMP. Alternatively, discrete DSL 
        parameters can also be conveyed by the BRAS in GSMP.

     4.3.2 Message Flow - GSMP mapping 

     Triggered by topology information reporting a new DSL line or triggered 
     by a subsequent user session establishment (PPP or DHCP), the BRAS may 
     send line configuration information (e.g. reference to a DSL profile) to 
     the DSLAM using Port Management messages. The BRAS may get such line     
     configuration data from a policy server (e.g. RADIUS). Figure 3 
     summarizes the interaction.

        The format of extensions to port management message is defined in 
        section 5.4.2. The line configuration models could be viewed as a 
        form of delegation of authorization from the BRAS to the DSLAM. 

   

     4.4 Layer2 Control for Transactional Multicast 

        Typical IP multicast in access networks involves the BRAS terminating 
        user requests for receiving multicast channels via IGMP. The BRAS 
        authorizes the subscriber, and dynamically determines the multicast 
        subscription rights for the subscriber. Based on the user's 
        subscription, the BRAS can replicate the same multicast stream to 
        multiple subscribers. This leads to a waste of access bandwidth if 
        multiple subscribers access network services via the same access-node 
        (e.g. DSLAM). The amount of multicast replication is of the order of 
        number of subscribers rather than the number of access-nodes. 

        It is ideal for BRAS to send a single copy of the multicast stream to 
        a given access-node, and let the access-node perform multicast 
        replication   by layer2 means (e.g. ATM point-to-multipoint cell 
        replication or ethernet data-link bridging) for subscribers behind 
        the access-node. However, operationally, BRAS is the ideal choice to 
        handle subscriber management functions (authentication, 
        authorization, accounting and address management), multicast policies 
        such as per-channel authorization, and complex multicast routing

        protocols. Therefore, some means is needed for the BRAS to setup 
        multicast replication state in the access-nodes. In ATM access 
        networks, Layer2 control protocol can be used by the BRAS to setup 
        P2MP cross-connects in the DSLAMs. GSMPv3 extensions for this use-
        case of layer2 control protocol will be provided in a separate ID 
        [6]. 

      

     4.5 Layer2 OAM 

        In case of an ATM based access aggregation network and an ATM based 
        local loop, end-to-end ATM OAM can be used for on-demand connectivity 
        testing, monitoring and fault localization. However, in case the 
        aggregation network between the BRAS and access-node is ethernet 
        based, end-to-end ATM OAM test can not be used. Ideally in Ethernet 
        based aggregation, end-to-end ethernet OAM as specified by ITU and 
        IEEE (801.ag / Y.17 ethoam) can provide access-line connectivity 
        testing and fault isolation. However, most DSL modems do not yet 
        support these standard ethernet OAM procedures. Also, various 
        technologies exist in the access network - ATM, EFM (ethernet in the 
        first mile, standardized in IEEE 802.3ah), GPON etc. These 
        technologies have their own link-based OAM mechanisms that have been 
        standardized or are under standardization in different standard 
        bodies. Inter-working between 802.1ag and different link-OAM 
        mechanisms are a work in progress and are being evaluated on a case 
        by case basis. 

        However, a simple solution based on L2C can provide BRAS with an 
        access-line test capability and to some extent fault isolation. 
        Controlled by a local management interface the BRAS can use an L2C 
        operation to trigger the access-node to perform a loopback test on 
        the local-loop (between the access-node and the CPE). The access-node 
        can respond via another L2C operation the result of the triggered 
        loopback test. In case of ATM based local-loop the L2C operation can 
        trigger the access-node to generate ATM (F4/F5) loopback cells on the 
        local loop. In case of Ethernet, the access-node can trigger an 
        ethernet loopback messages(per EFM OAM) on the local-loop. 

     4.5.1 Message Flow - GSMP mapping 

        GSMP “Port Management” message can be used by the BRAS to request 
        access node to trigger a “remote loopback” test on the local loop. 
        The result of the loopback test can be asynchronously conveyed by the 
        access node to the BRAS in a “Port Management” response message.

     5  GSMP for Layer2 Control Protocol 

     5.1 GSMP/TCP connection establishment 

        The L2 control protocol will use TCP for exchanging GSMP protocol 
        messages. [5] defines the GSMP message encapsulation for TCP. The TCP   
        session is initiated from the DSLAM (access node) to the BRAS 
        (controller). This is necessary to avoid static provisioning on the 
        BRAS for all the DSLAMs that are being served by the BRAS. It is 
        easier to configure a given DSLAM with the single ip address of the 
        BRAS that serves the DSLAM. This is a deviation from [5] which 
        indicates that the controller initiates the TCP connection to the 
        switch. 

        BRAS listens for incoming connections from the access nodes. Port 
        6068 is used for TCP connection. Adjacency protocol messages, which 
        are used to synchronize the BRAS and access-nodes and maintain 
        handshakes, are sent after the TCP connection is established. GSMP 
        messages other than adjacency protocol messages may be sent only 
        after the adjacency protocol has achieved synchronization. 

        In the case of ATM access, a separate PVC (control channel) capable 
        of transporting IP would be configured between BRAS and the DSLAM for     
        layer2 protocol messages.

     5.2 GSMP connection keep-alive 

        GSMP defines an adjacency protocol.  The adjacency protocol is used 
        to synchronize states across the link, to negotiate which version of 
        the GSMP protocol to use, to discover the identity of the entity at 
        the other end of a link, and to detect when it changes. GSMP is a 
        hard     state protocol.  It is therefore important to detect loss of 
        contact between switch and controller, and to detect any change of 
        identity    of switch or controller. No GSMP messages other than 
        those of the adjacency protocol may be sent across the link until the 
        adjacency protocol has achieved synchronization. There are no changes 
        to the base GSMP adjacency protocol for implementing layer2 control. 

        The BRAS will set the M-flag in the SYN message (signifying it is the 
        master). Once the adjacency is established, periodic adjacency 
        messages     (type ACK) are exchanged. The default ACK interval as 
        advertised in the adjacency messages is 10 sec for layer2 control 
        protocol. It SHOULD be configurable and is an implementation choice. 
        It is recommended that both ends specify the same timer value. 
        However, it is not necessary for the timer values to match. 

        The adjacency message is shown in the following section. The 
        semantics and suggested values for version, Code, “Sender Name”, 
        “Receiver Name”, “Sender Instance”, and “Receiver Instance” fields 
        are as defined in [4]. The “Sender Port”, and “Receiver Port” should 
        be set to 0 by both ends. The pType field should be set to 0. The 
        pFlag should be set to 1. 

        If the adjacency times out on either end, due to not receiving an 
        adjacency message for a duration of (3 * Timer value), where the 
        timer value is specified in the adjacency message, all the state 
        received from the L2C neighbor should be cleaned up, and the TCP 
        connection should be closed. The BRAS would continue to listen for 
        new connection requests. The DSLAM will try to re-establish the TCP 
        connection and both sides will attempt to re-establish the adjacency. 

        The handling defined above will need some modifications when L2C 
        graceful restart procedures are defined. These procedures are 
        currently not in scope and will be defined in a separate draft. 

          

     5.3 Capability negotiation 

        The GSMP adjacency message is extended to carry technology specific 
        "Capability TLVs". Both the BRAS and the access node will advertise 
        supported capabilities in the originated adjacency messages. If a

        received adjacency message indicates absence of support for a 
        capability that is supported by the receiving device, it will turn 
        off the capability locally and will send an updated adjacency message 
        with the capability turned off to match the received capability set. 
        This process will eventually result in both sides agreeing on the 
        minimal set of supported capabilities. The adjacency will not come up 
        unless the capabilities advertised by the controller and the 
        controlled device match. 

        After initial synchronization, if at anytime a capability mismatch is 
        detected, the adjacency will be brought down (RSTACK will be 
        generated by the device detecting the mismatch), and synchronization 
        will be re-attempted.

           |     Capability Type         |   Capability Length             |

        The Tech Type field type indicates the technology to which the 
        capability extension applies. For layer2 control in case of DSL 
        networks, new type "DSL" is proposed. The value for this field is 
        0x05. This is the first available value in the range that is not 
        currently allocated. It will need to be reserved with IANA. 

        Capability length is the number of actual bytes contained in the 
        value portion of the TLV. The TLV is padded to a 4-octet alignment. 
        Therefore, a TLV with no data will contain a zero in the length field 
        (if capability data is three octets, the length field will contain a 
        three, but the size of the actual TLV is eight octets). 

        Capability data field can be empty if the capability is just a 
        boolean. In case the capability is a boolean, it is inferred from the 
        presence of the TLV (with no data). Capability data provides the 
        flexibility to advertise more than mere presence or absence of a 
        capability. Capability types can be registered with IANA. Following 
        capabilities are defined for layer2 control protocol as applied to 
        DSL access: 

         

          1. Capability Type : Dynamic-Topology-Discovery = 0x01 

             Length (in bytes) : 0 

             Capability Data : NULL 

         

          2. Capability Type : Line-Configuration = 0x02 

             Length (in bytes) : 0 

             Capability Data : NULL

          3. Capability Type : Transactional-Multicast = 0x03 (controller 
             i.e. BRAS terminates IGMP messages from subscribers, and via l2 
             control protocol, signals state to the access-nodes (e.g. 
             DSLAMs) to enable layer2 replication of multicast streams. In 
             ATM access network this implies that BRAS instructs the access-
             node to setup a P2MP cross-connect. The details of this will be 
             covered in a separate ID [6].  

             Length (in bytes) : 0 

             Capability Data : NULL 

         

          4. Capability Type : OAM = 0x04  

             Length (in bytes) : 0

     5.4 GSMP Message Extensions for L2 control 

     5.4.1 Topology Discovery 

     The GSMP Event message with PORT UP message type (80) is used for 
     conveying DSL line attributes to the BRAS. The version field should be 
     set to 3, and the sub field should be set to 1. The I and subMessage 
     fields SHOULD be set to 1 to signify no fragmentation. The Port and 
     Label fields should be set to 0. The “Port Session Number” should be set 
     to 0, and the “Event Sequence Number” should be 0. The Tech Type field 
     is extended with new type "DSL". The value for this field is 0x05. The 
     message SHOULD be generated when a line first comes UP, or any of the 
     attributes of the line change e.g. the line re-trains to a different 
     rate or one or more of the configured line attributes are 
     administratively modified. Also, when the L2C session first comes up, 
     the DSLSM SHOULD transmit a PORT UP message to the BRAS for each line 
     that is up. A DSLAM MAY use a Bulk Transaction message as defined in [4] 
     to aggregate the transmission of PORT UP messages. 

     When a DSL line goes down (idle or silent), the DSLAM SHOULD transmit an 
     Event message with PORT DOWN message type (81) to the BRAS. It is 
     recommended that the DSLAMs use a dampening mechanism per DSL line to

        ~                                                               ~

        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
      

     The “Extension Value” contains one or more TLVs to identify a DSL line 
     and define it’s characteristics. A TLV can consist of multiple sub-TLVs. 
     First 2 byte of the “Extension Value” contains the number of TLVs that 
     follow. The next 2 bytes contain the total length of the TLVs carried in

        ~                                                               ~ 
        ~                           Value                               ~

        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
         

     The value field in each TLV is padded to a 4-octet alignment. The Length 
     field in each TLV contains the actual number of bytes in the TLV (not 
     including the padding if present). If a TLV is not understood by the 
     BRAS, it is silently ignored. Currently defined types start from 0x01. 

     Following TLVs are currently defined: 

       1. Type (Access-Loop-Circuit-ID = 0x01): This is a mandatory TLV and 
          contains an identifier of the subscriber’s connection to the access 
          node (i.e.  “local loop”). The “local loop” can be ATM based or 
          Ethernet based. The “Access Loop Circuit ID” has local significance 
          at the access node. The exact usage on the BRAS is beyond the scope 
          of this document. It is desirable that the format used for “local 
          loop” identification in GSMP messages is similar to what is used by 
          the access nodes in subscriber signaling messages when the access 
          nodes act as “signaling relay agents” as outlined in [7] and [8].  

          Length : (upto 63 bytes)  

          Value : ASCII string.                       

          For an ATM based local loop the string consists of slot/port and   
          VPI/VCI information corresponding to the subscriber’s DSL 
          connection. Typical format for the string inserted by the access 
          node is: 

          ‘‘Access-Node-Identifier atm slot/port:vpi.vci                                               ’’

          The Access-Node-Identifier uniquely identifies the access node in 
          the access network. The slot/port and VPI/VCI uniquely identifies 
          the DSL line on the access node. Also, there is one to one 
          correspondence between DSL line and the VC between the access node 
          and the BRAS.  

           For local loop which is Ethernet based (and tagged), the string 
           consists of slot/port and VLAN tag corresponding to the 
           subscriber. Typical format for the string is: 

            "Access-Node-Identifier eth slot/port[:vlan-id]"  
      
           
       2. Type (Access-Loop-Remote-Id = 0x02): This is an optional TLV and 
          contains an identifier to uniquely identify a user on a local loop 
          on the access node. The exact usage on the BRAS is out of scope of 
          this document. It is desirable that the format used for the field 
          is similar to what is used by the access nodes in subscriber 
          signaling messages when the access nodes act as “signaling relay 
          agents” as outlined in [7] and [8]. 

          Length : (upto 63 bytes) 

          Value  :  ASCII string 

               

       3. Type (Access-Aggregation-Circuit-ID-Binary = 0x04) 

          Length : (8 bytes)  

          Value : two 32 bit integers. 

          For ethernet access aggregation, where a per-subscriber (stacked) 
          VLAN can be applied (1:1 model defined in [8]), the VLAN stack 
          provides a convenient way to uniquely identify the DSL line. The 
          outer VLAN is equivalent to virtual path between a DSLAM and the 
          BRAS and inner VLAN is equivalent to a virtual circuit on a per DSL 
          line basis. In this scenario, any subscriber data received by the 
          access node and transmitted out the uplink to the aggregation 
          network will be tagged with the VLAN stack assigned by the access 
          node 

          This TLV can carry the VLAN tags assigned by the access node in the 
          GSMP messages. The VLAN tags can uniquely identify the DSL line 
          being referred to in the GSMP messages, assuming the VLAN tags are 
          not in any way translated in the aggregation network and are unique

          across physical ports. Each 32 bit integer (least significant bits) 
          contains a 12 bit VLAN identifier (which is part of the VLAN tag 
          defined by IEEE 802.1Q). 

          Also, in case of an ATM aggregation network, where the DSLAM is 
          directly connected to the BRAS (without an intermediate ATM 
          switch), the two values can contain VPI and VCI on the DSLAM uplink 
          (and can uniquely identify the DSL line on the DSLAM). 

          This TLV is optional. 

      

       4. Type (Access-Aggregation-Circuit-ID-ASCII = 0x03) 

          Length : (upto 63 bytes)  

          Value : ASCII string. 

          This field contains information pertaining to an uplink on the 
          access node. For Ethernet access aggregation, assuming the access 
          node assigns VLAN tags (1:1 model), typical format for the string 
          is: 

          ‘‘           Access-Node-Identifier eth slot/port [:inner-vlan-id][:outer-vlan-id]                                                                   ’’   

          The slot/port corresponds to the ethernet uplink on the access node 
          towards the BRAS. 

          For an ATM aggregation network, typical format for the string is: 

          ‘‘           Access-Node-Identifier atm slot/port:vpi.vci                                               ’’ 

          This TLVs allows the BRAS to associate the information contained in 
          the GSMP messages to the DSL line on the access node. 

          If the access node inserts this string in the GSMP messages, when 
          referring to local loop characteristics (e.g. DSL line in case of a 
          DSLAM), then it should be able to map the information contained in 
          the string uniquely to the local loop (e.g. DSL line). 

          On the BRAS, the information contained in this string can be used 
          to derive an “aggregation network” facing construct (e.g. an IP 
          interface) corresponding to the local loop (e.g. DSL line). The 
          association could be based on “local configuration” on the BRAS.

          The access node can also convey to the BRAS, the characteristics 
          (e.g. bandwidth) of the uplink on the access node. This TLV then 
          serves the purpose of uniquely identifying the uplink whose 
          characteristics are being defined. A separate set of sub-TLVs will 
          be defined for the uplink characteristics (TBD). 

          This TLV is optional. 

          

       5. Type (DSL Line Attributes = 0x04): 

          Length : variable (up to 1024 bytes) 

          Value : This consists of one or more Sub-TLVs corresponding to DSL     
          line attributes. No sub-TLVs other than the “DSL type” and “DSL 
          line state” SHOULD be included in a PORT DOWN message. 

          The general format of the sub-TLVs is identical to the general TLV   
          format. The value field in each sub-TLV is padded to a 4-octet 
          alignment. The Length field in each sub-TLV contains the actual 
          number of bytes in the TLV (not including the padding if present). 
          Current defined sub-TLV types are start from 0x81. 

          Following sub-TLVs are currently defined : 

          . Type (DSL-Type = 0x91) : Defines the type of transmission system 
             in use. This is a mandatory TLV. 

             Length :  (4 bytes)   

             Value  : (Transmission system : ADSL1 = 0x01, ADSL2 = 0x02,     
             ADSL2+ = 0x03, VDSL1 = 0x04, VDSL2 = 0x05, SDSL = 0x06, UNKNOWN 
             = 0x07). 

          . Type (Actual-Data-Rate-Upstream = 0x81) : Actual data rate 
             upstream of a synchronized DSL line. This is a mandatory TLV. 
             This rate value and all the subsequent ones account for the DSL 
             overhead (i.e. signify the net rate).   

            Length  :  (4 bytes) 

            Value   : (Rate in Kb/sec) 

          . Type (Actual-Data-Rate-Downstream = 0x82) : Actual data rate 
             downstream of a synchronized DSL line. This is a mandatory TLV.

     5.4.2 Line Configuration  

     The BRAS uses extension block in the Port Management messages to convey 
     service attributes of the DSL lines to the DSLAM. TLVs are defined for      
     DSL line identification and service data for the DSL lines. Port number 
     is set to 0 in the message. A new action type "Configure Connection 
     Service Data" (value 0x8) is defined. The "Function" field is set to the 
     action type. This action type indicates to the device being controlled 
     (access-node i.e. DSLAM) to apply service configuration data contained 
     in the extension value (TLVs), to the DSL line (identified by one of the 
     TLVs in the extension value). The Tech Type field is extended with new 
     type "DSL". The value for this field is 0x05.

        The “Extension Value” field contains one or more TLVs containing DSL 
        line identifier and desired service attributes of the the DSL line. 
        First 2 byte of the “Extension Value” contains the number of TLVs 
        that follow. The next 2 bytes contain the total length of the 
        extension block in bytes (existing “Block Length” field in the GSMP 
        message is limited to 255 bytes and is not sufficient). 

        General format of a TLV is :

        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
         

        The value field is padded to a 4-octet alignment. The Length field in 
        each TLV contains the actual number of bytes in the TLV (not 
        including the padding if present). If a TLV is not understood by the 
        access-node, it is silently ignored. Depending upon the deployment 
        scenario, the BRAS may specify “Access Loop Circuit-ID” or the 
        “Access Aggregation Circuit-ID) as defined in section 5.4.1.

     5.4.3 OAM 

        GSMP “Port Management” message (type 32) SHOULD be used by the BRAS 
        to trigger access node to run a loopback test on the local loop. The 
        message format is defined in section 5.4.2. The version field SHOULD 
        be set to 3 and sub-version field SHOULD be set to 1. The remaining 
        fields in the GSMP header have standard semantics. The function type 
        used in the request message SHOULD be set to “remote loopback” (type 
        = 0x09). The port, “port session number”, “event sequence number”, 
        duration, “event flags”, “flow control flags” and code fields SHOULD 
        all be set to 0. The result field SHOULD be set to “AckAll” to 
        indicate requirement for the access node to send a success for 
        failure response. The transaction ID SHOULD contain a sequence number 
        inserted by the BRAS in each request that it generates. The extension 
        field format is also defined above in section 5.4.2. The extension 
        value field can contain one or more TLVs including the access-line 
        identifier on the DSLAM and OAM test characteristics desired by the 
        BRAS.  

        The TLV format is defined above in section 5.4.2. The value field is 
        padded to a 4-octet alignment. The Length field in each TLV contains 
        the actual number of bytes in the TLV (not including the padding if 
        present). If a TLV is not understood by the BRAS, it is silently 
        ignored. Depending upon the deployment scenario, the BRAS may specify 
        “Access Loop Circuit-ID” or the “Access Aggregation Circuit-ID) as 
        defined in section 5.4.1. Following TLVs can appear in this message:

           loopback test. This is an optional TLV. If this TLV is not present 
           in the request message, the DSLAM SHOULD use locally determined 
           default values for the test parameters.  

           Length: 4 bytes

           significant)  

            o  Count (1 byte) : Number of loopback cells/messages that should 
               be generated on the local loop as part of the loopback test. 
               The BRAS SHOULD restrict the “count” to be greater than 0 and 
               less than or equal to 32. The DSLAM SHOULD discard the request 
               for a loopback test, if the received test parameters contain 
               an out of range value for the “count” field. The DSLAM MAY 
               optionally send a failure response to the BRAS with the code 
               “invalid test parameter”.         

            o  Timeout (1 byte) : Upper bound on the time in seconds that the 
               BRAS would wait for a response from the DSLAM. If the total 
               time taken by the DSLAM to complete a test with requested 
               parameters, exceeds the specified “timeout” value, it can 
               choose to omit the generation of a response to the BRAS. DSLAM 
               SHOULD use a locally determined value for the “timeout”, if 
               the received value of the “timeout” parameter is 0. 

         

        o  Type (Opaque-Data = 0x08) : This is an optional TLV. If present in 
           the request message, the DSLAM SHOULD reflect it back in the 
           response unmodified. 

           Length : 8 bytes 

           Value : Two 32 bit integers inserted by the BRAS (not to be 
           interpreted by the DSLAM, but just reflected back in the 
           response).

        The access node generates a success or failure response when it deems 
        the loopback test to be complete. “Port Management” message (type 32) 
        is used. The result field SHOULD be set to success or failure. The 
        function type SHOULD be set to 0x09. The transaction ID SHOULD be 
        copied from the sequence number contained in the corresponding 
        request. The other parameters not explicitly defined here SHOULD be 
        set as specified in the request message above. The code field SHOULD 
        be set to a value in the range 0x500 to 0x5ff (to be reserved with 
        IANA) to indicate the status of the executed test. The valid values 
        defined are (can be extended in future): 

              0x500 : Specified access line does not exist. 

              0x501 : Loopback test timed out. 

              0x502 : Reserved 

              0x503 : DSL line status showtime. 

              0x504 : DSL line status idle. 

              0x505 : DSL line status silent. 

              0x506 : DSL line status training. 

              0x507 : DSL line integrity error. 

              0x508 : DSLAM resource not available. 

              0x509 : Invalid test parameter. 

     The Extension value can contain one or more TLVs including the TLV to 
     identify the access line on which the test was performed, and details 
     from executing the test. The access line identifier SHOULD be be 
     identical to what was contained in the request. The relevant TLVs are:

           Length : 8 bytes 

           Value : Two 32 bit integers as received in the request (opaque to 
           the DSLAM). 

        o  Type (OAM-Loopback-Test-Response-String = 0x09) 

           Length (upto 128 bytes) 

           Value : Suitably formatted ASCII string containing useful details 
           about the test that the BRAS will display for the operator, 
           exactly as received from the DSLAM (no manipulation/interpretation 
           by the BRAS). This is an optional TLV, but it is strongly 
           recommended, that in case of ATM based local loop, the DSLAM at 
           the very least indicates via this TLV, the total loopback cells 
           generated and the total loopback cells successfully received as 
           part of executing the requested loopback test.      

             

     5.5 ATM-specific considerations 

        The topology discovery and line configuration involve the DSL line 
        attributes. For ATM based access networks, the DSL line on the DSLAM 
        is identified by the port and PVP/PVC corresponding to the 
        subscriber. The DSLAMs are connected to the BRAS via an ATM access 
        aggregation network. Since, the   DSLAM (access-node) is not directly 
        connected to the BRAS, the BRAS needs a mechanism to learn the DSL 
        line identifier (more generally referred to as "Access Loop Circuit-
        ID") corresponding to a subscriber. The "Access loop circuit-ID" has 
        no local significance on the BRAS. The GSMP messages for topology 
        discovery and line configuration carry opaque "Access loop Circuit-
        ID" which has only local significance on the DSLAMs.  

        The access loop circuit identifier can be carried as an ASCII string 
        in the GSMP messages. This allows layer2 control protocol to be 
        decoupled from the specifics of the underlying access technology 
        being controlled. On the other hand, this requires a BRAS mechanism 
        by which such identifier can be correlated to the context of an 
        “aggregation network” facing IP interface (corresponding to the 
        subscriber) on the BRAS. This would typically require local 
        configuration of such IP interfaces, or of the underlying ATM 
        interfaces.

     5.6 Ethernet-specific considerations 

     One possible way of approaching the use of Ethernet technology in the 
     access aggregation network is to recreate the equivalent of Virtual 
     Paths (VPs) and Virtual Circuits (VCs) by using stacked Virtual LAN 
     tags. As an example, one could use an “outer” VLAN to create a form of 
     “virtual path” between a given DSLAM and a given BRAS. And then use 
     “inner” VLAN tags to create a form of “virtual circuit” on a per DSL 
     line basis. In this case, VLAN tags conveyed in topology discovery and 
     line configuration messages will allow to uniquely identify the DSL line 
     in a straightforward manner, assuming the VLAN tags are not translated 
     in some way by the aggregation network, and are unique across physical 
     ports. 
      
     However, some carriers do not wish to use this “connection oriented” 
     approach. Therefore, an alternative model is to bridge sessions from 
     multiple subscribers behind a DSLAM to a single VLAN in the aggregation 
     network. This is the N:1 model. In this model, or in the case where user 
     traffic is sent untagged, the access node needs to insert the exact 
     identity of the DSL line in the topology discovery and line 
     configuration messages, and then have a mechanism by which this can be 
     correlated to the context of an “aggregation network” facing IP 
     interface (for the subscriber) on the BRAS. This can either be based on 
     local configuration on the BRAS, or on the fact that such DSLAM (access 
     node) typically inserts the “Access Loop Circuit ID” in subscriber 
     signaling messages relayed to the BRAS (i.e. DHCP or PPPoE discovery 
     messages). 
       
     Section 5.4.1 defines “Access Loop Circuit ID”. 
       

     5.7 Graceful restart considerations (TBD) 

                                                                     

     6  IANA Considerations 

        New Tech-Type, capability types, sub-TLV types related to topology 
        discovery and line configuration will need to be reserved. 

     7  Security Considerations 

        The BRAS and DSLAMs are implicitly in a trusted domain, so security        
        for L2-Control protocol is not a strong requirement. However if 
        needed security can be provided using IP security as indicated in 
        [RFC3293].
