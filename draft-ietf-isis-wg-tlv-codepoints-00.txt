Abstract

    This draft describes implementation codepoints within
    IS-IS [ISO90 , Cal90a , Cal90b ] used today by several ISPs for
    routing within their clouds.  IS-IS is an interior gateway routing
    protocol developed originally by OSI and used with IP extensions as
    IGP. This draft summarizes all TLV codepoints that are being used by

    the protocol and its pending extensions.

2.  Assignment Procedures

    This document is provided to avoid possible future conflicts in
    assignment of TLV numbers.  It does not constitute or represent any
    standard or authority assigning TLV numbers.  TLV assignment happens

    on a shared, informational basis between the ISO, SIF and the IETF
    working groups.  The core ISIS protocol is being specified in the
    ISO standards body, IP extensions to it however are products of the
    ISIS working group in IETF. Since ISO does not provide a numbering
    authority and IANA is only responsible for IP related coding points,

    no plausible central authority to assign TLV numbers exists as of
    today.
