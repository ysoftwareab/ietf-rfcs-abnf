Abstract 
         
    This document extends the Point-to-Point Over Ethernet (PPPoE) 
    Protocol [2] with a forwarding mode for IP multicast packets or 
    broadcast packets in PPPoE networks. This optional extension 
    can improve the performance of the IP multicasting and 
    broadcasting in PPPoE links.

Internet-Draft   PPPoE Extensions for multicast/broadcast   April 2007


2. Introduction 
     
    PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE) provides the ability to connect a network
    of hosts (PPPoE Client) over a simple bridging access device to a 
    remote Access Concentrator(PPPoE Server). There are two phases in 
    PPPoE protocol, Discovery stage and PPP Session stage. When the 
    Discovery stage completes, both peers know the PPPoE SESSION_ID and 
    the peer's Ethernet address. During the PPP Session stage, All 
    Ethernet packets are unicast. So when Access Concentrator needs to 
    send IP multicast packets or broadcast packets to Hosts in a same 
    Ethernet, it has to send these packets to each host over each PPPoE 
    link, because the hosts are all in a Ethernet, so its performance is
    bad and wastes the net's resource.
    
    This document define a forwarding mode for IP multicast packets 
    or broadcast packets to increase the performance of the IP 
    multicasting and broadcasting in PPPoE links. These extensions to 
    PPPoE are optional and preserve compatibility.         
         
3. Overview of Protocol Extensions 
         
    PPPoE has two distinct stages.  There is a Discovery Stage and a PPP 
    Session Stage. During the Discovery Stage, the host can optionally 
    request a forwarding mode for IP multicast packets or broadcast 
    packets controlled PPP Session Stage.  Once the Access Concentrator 
    acknowledges the host forwarding mode request, all IP multicast 
    packets or broadcast packets during PPP Session Stage must be 
    forwarded according to the negotiated forwaring mode. The forwaring 
    mode is described below.

    IP multicast packets or broadcast packets during PPP Session Stage 
    must be forwarded in a PPPoE encapsulation according to the existing 
    PPPoE protocol. The extensions described in this document allow 
    these packets be forwarded in the other encapsulations. These 
    extended encapsulations are described as follows.

    IP multicast packets are partitioned two sorts of packets: protocol 
    packets (e.g. IGMP/MLD packet) and bearer data packets (i.e. 
    mulitcast flow). These two kinds of multicast packets and broadcast
    packets can be all forwarded in the following encapsulations.
    
    A. PPPoE

      It means these packets are forwarded in the existing PPPoE 
      encapsulation during PPP Session Stage.

      This case is compliant to the existing PPPoE protocol.

Internet-Draft   PPPoE Extensions for multicast/broadcast   April 2007


    B. IPoE

      It means these packets are forwarded in the IPoE encapsulation 
      during PPP Session Stage.

      For broadcast packets, This encapsulation only denotes that
      Access Concentrator can send broadcast packets encapsulated in 
      IPoE and the host can receive the corresponding broadcast packets 
      encapsulated in IPoE, and that the host can't send broadcast 
      packets encapsulated in IPoE associated the PPPoE sessions, it can 
      send broadcast packets encapsulated in PPPoE associated the PPPoE 
      sessions.
    
    In addition, multicast protocol packets can be forwarded in another 
    encapsulation. This encapsulation is PPPoE and IPoE. It means 
    multicast protocol packets are forwarded as both PPPoE as well as 
    IPoE packets to the network during PPP Session Stage, that is, a 
    multicast protocol packet is sent twice, it is forwarded in a PPPoE
    encapsulation for the first time, then it is forwarded in a IPoE 
    encapsulation once more.

    There is only one combination of the above encapsulations for 
    forwarding multicast packets during a PPPoE session.

    A. Forwarding multicast protocol packets encapsulated in PPPoE, 
       forwarding multicast bearer data packets encapsulated in IPoE.

       In this case, multicast protocol packets are asked to be 
       forwarded in PPPoE Links according to RFC2516(PPPoE), so 
       multicast access controls on per subscriber basis can be provided
       by observing the IGMP/MLD report packets, and multicast group 
       keepalive mechanism on per subscriber basis and per multicast 
       group basis can be also achieved by utilizing the IGMP/MLD query
       and report packets in a PPPoE link, this keepalive mechanism can
       be used to detect which multicast groups the hosts have currently
       joined and how long the hosts have joined them, this is 
       meaningful to accurately bill the hosts.

       Multicast bearer data packets are forwarded in a IPoE 
       encapsulation, this mode is the same as the existing IP multicast
       implementation. PPPoE multicast functionality is optimized by 
       efficient replication as IPoE multicast.

       When multicast packets are forwarded in this way, the 
       intermediate (L2) device between hosts and Access Concentrator 
       need support IGMP or MLD snooping/proxy [3][4] within the PPPoE
       session for establishment of multicast forwarding entries, or 
       the multicast forwarding entries in the intermediate devices are

       provided by PPPoE Access Concentrator making use of other dynamic
       protocols or management system.

    B. Forwarding multicast protocol packets encapsulated in PPPoE and 
       IPoE, forwarding multicast bearer data packets encapsulated in 
       IPoE.

       The description is the same as the previous section except the 
       following.
       
       In this case, a multicast protocol packet is forwarded as both 
       PPPoE as well as IPoE packets. 

       The IPoE encapsulated multicast protocol packet can be used 
       to achieving IGMP or MLD snooping/proxy function by the the 
       intermediate device between hosts and Access Concentrator, and 
       then the the existing IP multicast implementation of the 
       intermediate device remain unchanged to ensure inter-operability.
       
       A multicast protocol packet is received in both the IPoE 
       encapsulation as well as the PPPoE session by both PPPoE peers, 
       and therefore both peers should check whether the both 
       encapsulatin multicast protocol packet is the same by matching 
       the source address, use the multicast protocol packets from the
       PPPoE session to correlate to the appropriate multicast bearer
       data packets encapsulated in IPoE. Once again, this source 
       address may be a IP/MAC address.              

    C. Forwarding multicast protocol packets encapsulated in PPPoE, 
       forwarding multicast bearer data packets encapsulated in PPPoE.
       
       The forwarding mode for PPPoE multicast packets is the same as 
       the existing PPPoE multicast implementation in this case.

    D. Forwarding multicast protocol packets encapsulated in IPoE, 
       forwarding multicast bearer data packets encapsulated in IPoE.
       
       The forwarding mode for PPPoE multicast packets is the same as 
       the existing IP multicast implementation in this case. PPPoE 
       multicast functionality is optimized by efficient replication as
       IPoE multicast.

    E. Other combinations.
       
       Other combinations aren't meaningful.

    In addition, there are only one combination of the above 
    encapsulations for broadcast packets during a PPPoE session.

Internet-Draft   PPPoE Extensions for multicast/broadcast   April 2007


    A. Forward broadcast packets encapsulated in PPPoE.
       
       The forwarding mode for PPPoE broadcast packets is the same as  
       the existing PPPoE broadcast implementation in this case.

    B. Forward broadcast packets encapsulated in IPoE.
       
       The forwarding mode for PPPoE broadcast packets is the same as 
       the existing IP broadcast implementation in this case. PPPoE 
       broadcast functionality is optimized by efficient replication as
       IPoE broadcast.

4. Discovery Stage 

    The packet exchange of the Discovery Stage is unchanged by this 
    specification.  The specifications of the PADI, PADO, PADR and 
    PADS packets are extended to include the optional forwarding Tag 
    Type-Length-Value (TLV).   
      
4.1 PPPoE Active Discovery Initiation (PADI)

    The PADI packet is extended to optionally contain several 
    Forward-Mode Tag TLVs, indicating that the host requests forwarding 
    control for this session when forwarding multicast packets or 
    broadcast packets.  

4.2 PPPoE Active Discovery Offer (PADO)

    The PADO packet is extended to optionally contain several 
    Forward-Mode Tag TLVs, indicating the forwarding mode supported by
    Access Concentrator for multicast packets or broadcast packets 
    during the PPP Session Stage.
    
    Access Concentrator may perform one of the following actions if it
    supports the negotiation for the forwarding mode described in this 
    document.
    
    A. Access Concentrator optionally contain several Forward-Mode Tag 
       TLVs supported by itself , and any number of other TAG types.

    B. Access Concentrator optionally only contain the requested 
       Forward-Mode Tag TLVs by the host and supported by itself , and 
       any number of other TAG types.

    To ensure inter-operability, Access Concentrator MAY silently ignore
    the TAGs in PADI if it does't supports the negotiation for the 
    forwarding mode described in this document.

Internet-Draft   PPPoE Extensions for multicast/broadcast   April 2007


4.3 PPPoE Active Discovery Request (PADR) Access Concentrator
         
    The PADR packet is extended to optionally contain several 
    Forward-Mode Tag TLVs, indicating that the host requests forwarding
    control for this session when forwarding multicast packets or 
    broadcast packets. 

    The host may perform one of the following actions if it supports 
    the negotiation for the forwarding mode described in this document.
    
    A. If the PADO contains Forward-Mode Tags that host is 
       requesting, then the host can choose the forwarding mode 
       the host is requesting, The PADR packet should contain 
       Forward-Mode TAGs the host is requesting. 

    B. If the PADO does't contains Forward-Mode Tags that host is 
       requesting, then The PADR packet does't contain any Forward-Mode
       TAGs. 

    To ensure inter-operability, host MAY silently ignore the TAGs
    in PADO if it does't supports the negotiation for the forwarding 
    mode described in this document.

    An example packet is shown in Appendix B. 
                  
4.4 PPPoE Active Discovery Session-confirmation (PADS) 
         
    The PADS packet is extended to optionally contain several 
    Forward-Mode Tag TLVs, indicating the forwarding mode supported by 
    Access Concentrator for multicast packets or broadcast packets of 
    the PPP Session Stage.   

    If the PADR contains Forward-Mode Tags, then the Access Concentrator 
    PADS packet indicates support for forwarding control by including  
    Forward-Mode Tags.  The PADS Forward-Mode Tags indicate the 
    forwarding mode under which Access Concentrator has accepted the 
    PPPoE session.   

    Exchange of the Forward-Mode Tag TLVs in the Discovery packets 
    indicates that forwarding control is supported by both the Access 
    Concentrator and the host for the designated PPP Session Stage.  
    This is binding and must be followed for the entire duration of the
    PPP Session Stage.

    The Access Concentrator PADS should only carry the Forward-Mode Tags
    in response to a host PADR with Forward-Mode tags. If the Access 
    Concentrator does not support the forwarding modes requested, it 
    must not include the Forward-Mode Tags in its PADS response.

Internet-Draft   PPPoE Extensions for multicast/broadcast   April 2007


    When the host receives the PADS containing the Forward-Mode tags it 
    is requesting, then the host must forward packets by the forwarding 
    mode supported by both the host and the Access Concentrator.  

    When the host receives the PADS that it does't contain the 
    Forward-Mode tags it is requesting, then the host must forward 
    packets by the default forwarding mode, i.e. PPPoE mode.     

    An example packet is shown in Appendix B. 

5. PPP Session Stage 
         
    Multicast packets or broadcast packets are forwarded in the 
    negotiated forwarding mode by both PPPoE peers during the PPP 
    Session Stage. Other packets are forwarded in the existing PPPoE
    encapsulation.  
    
6. Other Considerations

    Note that this PPPoE Extension does not consider optimizing 
    multicast delivery over PPPoA and other PPPoX sessions and therefore
    those scenarios are not considered.

    "This definitely needs to be expanded to discuss PPP NCP [1] 
    Extension for IP multicast and broadcast."
       
7. IANA Considerations 
 
   This document proposes a PPPoE tag to be maintained by the IANA. 
   The tag Forward-Mode may be assigned the values 0x0122 so as not to 
   conflict with the defintions for recognized PPPoE tags, as defined in 
   RFC 2516 [2].

8. Security Considerations 
         
    This memo defines a mode for forwarding control to the
    existing PPP Over Ethernet (PPPoE) sessions.  These extensions
    are subsequent to the existing PPPoE security mechanisms as 
    described in RFC 2516 [2].

    This tag contains the Forwarded Packet Type(FPT) and the Forwarding 
    Encapsulation(FE). The Forward-Mode Tag TLV is OPTIONAL with the 
    PADI, PADO, PADR and PADS, and can be contained more than one in a 
    Discovery packet.
