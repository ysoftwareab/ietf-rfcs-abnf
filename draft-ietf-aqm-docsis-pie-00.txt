                A PIE-Based AQM for DOCSIS Cable Modems
                      draft-ietf-aqm-docsis-pie-00

Abstract

   DOCSIS cable modems provide broadband Internet access to over one
   hundred million users worldwide.  They are commonly positioned at the
   head of the bottleneck link for traffic in the upstream direction
   (from the customer), and as a result, the impact of buffering and
   bufferbloat in the cable modem can have a significant effect on user
   experience.  The CableLabs DOCSIS 3.1 specification includes
   requirements for cable modems to support an Active Queue Management
   (AQM) algorithm that is intended to alleviate the impact that
   buffering has on latency sensitive traffic, while preserving bulk
   throughput performance.  In addition, the CableLabs DOCSIS 3.0
   specifications have also been amended to contain similar
   requirements.

1.  Overview of DOCSIS AQM Requirements

   CableLabs' DOCSIS 3.1 specification [DOCSIS_3.1] mandates that cable
   modems implement a specific variant of the Proportional Integral
   controller Enhanced (PIE) [I-D.ietf-aqm-pie] active queue management
   algorithm.  This specific variant is provided for reference in
   Appendix A.  CableLabs' DOCSIS 3.0 specification [DOCSIS_3.0] has
   been amended to recommend that cable modems implement the same
   algorithm.  Both specifications allow that cable modems can
   optionally implement additional algorithms, that can then be selected
   for use by the operator via the modem's configuration file.

   These requirements on the cable modem apply to upstream
   transmissions.

   Both specifications also include requirements (mandatory in DOCSIS
   3.1 and recommended in DOCSIS 3.0) that the Cable Modem Termination

   System (CMTS) implement active queue management for downstream
   traffic, however no specific algorithm is defined for downstream use.

2.  The DOCSIS MAC Layer and Service Flows

   The DOCSIS Media Access Control (sub-)layer provides tools for
   configuring differentiated Quality of Service for different
   applications by the use of Packet Classifiers and Service Flows.

   Each cable modem can be configured with multiple Packet Classifiers
   and Service Flows.  The maximum number of such entities that a cable
   modem supports is an implementation decision for the manufacturer,
   but modems typically support 16 or 32 Service Flows and at least that
   many Packet Classifiers.

   Each Service Flow has an associated Quality of Service (QoS)
   parameter set that defines the treatment of the packets that traverse
   the Service Flow.  These parameters include (for example) Minimum
   Reserved Traffic Rate, Maximum Sustained Traffic Rate, Peak Traffic
   Rate, Maximum Traffic Burst, Traffic Priority.  Each upstream Service
   Flow corresponds to a queue in the cable modem, and each downstream
   Service Flow corresponds to a queue in the CMTS.  The DOCSIS AQM
   requirements mandate that the CM and CMTS implement the AQM algorithm
   (and allow it to be disabled if need be) on each Service Flow queue
   independently.

   Packet Classifiers can match packets based upon several fields in the
   packet/frame headers including the Ethernet header, IP header, and
   TCP/UDP header.  Matched packets are then queued in the associated
   Service Flow queue.

   It is typical that upstream and downstream Service Flows used for
   broadband Internet access are configured with a Maximum Sustained
   Traffic Rate.  This QoS parameter rate-shapes the traffic onto the
   DOCSIS link, and is the main parameter that defines the service
   offering.  Additionally, it is common that upstream and downstream
   Service Flows are configured with a Maximum Traffic Burst and a Peak
   Traffic Rate.  These parameters allow the service to burst at a
   higher (sometimes significantly higher) rate than is defined in the
   Maximum Sustained Traffic Rate for the amount of bytes configured in
   Maximum Traffic Burst, as long as the long-term average data rate
   remains at or below the Maximum Sustained Traffic Rate.

   Mathematically, what is enforced is that the traffic placed on the
   DOCSIS link in the time interval (t1,t2) complies with the following
   rate shaping equations:

      TxBytes(t1,t2) <= (t2-t1)*R/8 + B



White & Pan            Expires September 28, 2015               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                 docsis-pie                     March 2015


      TxBytes(t1,t2) <= (t2-t1)*P/8 + 1522

   for all values t2>t1, where:

      R = Maximum Sustained Traffic Rate (bps)

      P = Peak Traffic Rate (bps)

      B = Maximum Traffic Burst (bytes)

   The result of this configuration is that the link rate available to
   the Service Flow varies based on the pattern of load.  If the load
   that the Service Flow places on the link is less than the Maximum
   Sustained Traffic Rate, the Service Flow "earns" credit that it can
   then use (should the load increase) to burst at the Peak Traffic
   Rate.  This dynamic is important since these rate changes
   (particularly the decrease in data rate once the traffic burst credit
   is exhausted) can induce a step increase in buffering latency.

3.  DOCSIS-PIE vs. PIE

   There are a number of differences between the version of the PIE
   algorithm that is mandated for cable modems in the DOCSIS
   specifications and the version described in [I-D.ietf-aqm-pie].

   o  10 ms default latency target, configurable per service flow

   o  departure rate estimation

   o  expanded auto-tuning range

   o  trigger for exponential decay

3.1.  Latency Target

   The latency target (aka delay reference) is a key parameter that
   affects, among other things, the tradeoff in performance between
   latency-sensitive applications and bulk TCP applications.  Via
   simulation studies, a value of 10ms was identified as providing a
   good balance of performance.  However, it is recognized that there
   may be service offerings for which this value doesn't provide the
   best performance balance.  As a result, this is provided as a
   configuration parameter that the operator can set independently on
   each upstream service flow.  If not explicitly set by the operator,
   the modem will use 10 ms as the default value.

3.2.  Departure rate estimation

   The PIE algorithm utilizes a departure rate estimator to track
   fluctuations in the egress rate for the queue and to generate a
   smoothed estimate of this rate for use in the drop probability
   calculation.  This estimator may be well suited to many link
   technologies, but is not ideal for DOCSIS upstream links for a number
   of reasons.

   First, the bursty nature of the upstream transmissions, in which the
   queue drains at line rate (up to ~100 Mbps for DOCSIS 3.0 and ~1 Gbps
   for DOCSIS 3.1) and then is blocked until the next transmit
   opportunity, results in the potential for inaccuracy in measurement,
   given that the PIE departure rate estimator starts each measurement
   during a transmission burst and ends each measurement during a
   (possibly different) transmission burst.  For example, in the case
   where the start and end of measurement occur within a single burst,
   the PIE estimator will calculate the egress rate to be equal to the
   line rate, rather than the average rate available to the modem.

   Second, the latency introduced by the DOCSIS request-grant mechanism
   can result in some further inaccuracy.  In typical conditions, the
   request-grant mechanism can add between ~4 ms and ~8 ms of latency to
   the forwarding of upstream traffic.  Within that range, the amount of
   additional latency that affects any individual data burst is
   effectively random, being influenced by the arrival time of the burst
   relative to the next request transmit opportunity, among other
   factors.

   Third, in the significant majority of cases, the departure rate,
   while variable, is controlled by the modem itself via the pair of
   token bucket rate shaping equations described in Section 2.
   Together, these two equations enforce a maximum sustained traffic
   rate, a peak traffic rate, and a maximum traffic burst size for the
   modem's requested bandwidth.  The implication of this is that the
   modem, in the significant majority of cases, will know precisely what
   the departure rate will be, and can predict exactly when transitions
   between peak rate and maximum sustained traffic rate will occur.
   Compare this to the PIE estimator, which would be simply reacting to
   (and smoothing its estimate of) those rate transitions after the
   fact.

   Finally, since the modem is already implementing the dual token
   bucket traffic shaper, it contains enough internal state to calculate
   predicted queuing delay with a minimum of computations.  Furthermore,
   these computations only need to be run every drop probability update
   interval, as opposed to the PIE estimator, which runs a similar
   number of computations on each packet dequeue event.

Internet-Draft                 docsis-pie                     March 2015


   For these reasons, the DOCSIS-PIE algorithm utilizes the
   configuration and state of the dual token bucket traffic shaper to
   translate queue depth into predicted queuing delay, rather than
   implementing the departure rate estimator defined in PIE.

3.3.  Expanded auto-tuning range

   The PIE algorithm scales the PI coefficients based on the current
   drop probability.  The DOCSIS-PIE algorithm extends this scaling to
   drop probabilities below 1e-4.

3.4.  Trigger for exponential decay

   The PIE algorithm includes a mechanism by which the drop probability
   is allowed to decay exponentially (rather than linearly) when it is
   detected that the buffer is empty.  In the DOCSIS case, recently
   arrived packets may reside in buffer due to the request-grant latency
   even if the link is effectively idle.  As a result, the buffer may
   not be identically empty in the situations for which the exponential
   decay is intended.  To compensate for this, we trigger exponential
   decay when the buffer occupancy is less than 5ms * Peak Traffic Rate.

4.  Implementation Guidance

   The AQM space is an evolving one, and it is expected that continued
   research in this field may in the future result in improved
   algorithms.

   As part of defining the DOCSIS-PIE algorithm, we split the pseudocode
   definition into two components, a "data path" component and a
   "control path" component.  The control path component contains the
   packet drop probability update functionality, whereas the data path
   component contains the per-packet operations, including the drop
   decision logic.

   It is understood that some aspects of the cable modem implementation
   may be done in hardware, particularly functions that handle packet-
   processing.

   While the DOCSIS specifications don't mandate the internal
   implementation details of the cable modem, modem implementers are
   strongly advised against implementing the control path functionality
   in hardware.  The intent of this advice is to retain the possibility
   that future improvements in AQM algorithms can be accommodated via
   software updates to deployed devices.

Appendix A.  DOCSIS-PIE Algorithm definition

   PIE defines two functions organized here into two design blocks:

   1.  Control path block, a periodically running algorithm that
       calculates a drop probability based on the estimated queuing
       latency and queuing latency trend.

   2.  Data path block, a function that occurs on each packet enqueue:
       per-packet drop decision based on the drop probability.

   It is desired to have the ability to update the Control path block
   based on operational experience with PIE deployments.

A.3.  DOCSIS-PIE AQM Data Path

   The DOCSIS-PIE data path performs the following:

   o  Calls enque() in response to an incoming packet from the CMCI

   ================

           drop(packet);
       } else {
           queue_.enque(packet);
       }
   }

   ////////////////
   drop_early(packet, queue_length) {
       if (burst_allowance_ > 0) {
           return FALSE;
