Abstract

   The conference policy server allows clients to manipulate and
   interact with the conference policy. One mechanism to manipulate the
   policy is to use conference policy control protocol (CPCP). This
   document gives the requirements for CPCP.

Internet-Draft                  CPCP-req                   December 2003


1. Introduction

   The conferencing framework document [3] describes the overall
   architecture, terminology, and protocol components needed for multi-
   party conferencing. It defines a logical function called a conference
   policy server (CPS) which can store and manipulate rules associated
   with participation in a conference.  These rules include directives
   on the lifespan of the conference, who can and cannot join the
   conference, definitions of roles available in the conference and the
   responsibilities associated with those roles, and policies on who is
   allowed to request which roles.

   The conference policy control protocol (CPCP) is a client-server
   protocol that can be used by users to manipulate the rules associated
   with the conference.

   The conference policy is represented by a URI. There is a unique
   conference policy for each conference. The conference policy URI
   points to a conference policy server which can manipulate that
   conference policy.

   Conferencing framework describes also conference notification service
   that is a logical function provided by the focus. It means that the
   focus can act as a notifier, accepting subscriptions to the
   conference state.

   Note that CPCP is not the only mechanism to manipulate conference
   policy, but other mechanisms exists as well, such as Web interface.

   This document can be used with other documents, such as Conferencing
   framework document [3]. Moreover, [5] and [7] give useful background
   information about conferencing and floor control.

3. Terminology

   This document uses the definitions from [3].

   Additional definitions:

      ACL

         Access control list (ACL) defines users who can join a
         conference. Users may have allow, blocked or pending status in
         the list. Each conference has its own ACL.

      Moderator

         A special (privileged) role for a user that is allowed to
         manipulate conference policy and override policy decisions made
         by other users.

      Floor control

         Floor control is a mechanism that enables applications or users
         to gain safe and mutually exclusive or non-exclusive access to
         the shared object or resource in a conference.

      Privilege

         A privilege is a right to perform a manipulation operation in a
         conference. It is user permission such as the right to modify
         ACL or expel users.

Internet-Draft                  CPCP-req                   December 2003


4. Integration with Floor Control

   Floor control is an optional feature often used by conferencing
   applications.  It enables applications or users to gain safe and
   mutually exclusive or non-exclusive input access to a shared object
   or resource. We define a floor as the temporary permission for a
   conference participant to access or manipulate a specific shared
   resource or group of resources.

   We assume that the ability of users to create floors is governed by
   the conference policy. Privileged conference user may use floor
   control protocol (see e.g. [6]) or some other mechanism to create
   floors.

   The conference policy defines who is allowed to create, change, and
   remove floors using the floor control protocol.

   Floor chair is also appointed using the floor control protocol when
   the floor is created.  Typically, only conference moderators are
   allowed to use these commands.

   The conference moderator can remove the floor at any time using floor
   control protocol (so that the resources are no longer floor-
   controlled), or change the floor chair or the floor parameters.

   The floor chair just controls the access to the floor, according to
   the floor policy, defined at a time when the floor is created.

5. Conference Policy Data Model

   Conference policy data is relatively static. It is not updated
   frequently as e.g. participant list is not part of conference policy.
   Users with sufficient privileges are able to manipulate conference
   policy.  For example, a user with sufficient privileges may
   manipulate conference's access control list by adding a user into the
   ACL allowed list.

6. CPCP Requirements

   This section describes requirements for the conference policy
   protocol.

6.1 Conference creation, termination and joining

   REQ-A1: It MUST be possible to create a new conference addressable by
   a URI.

   REQ-A2: It MUST be possible to associate policy attributes to a
   conference URI.

   REQ-A3: It MUST be possible to reserve a conference URI for future
   use with or without associating policy attributes to it.

   REQ-A4: It SHOULD be possible for a privileged user to read
   conference policy for a given conference URI, during and before
   joining the conference.

   REQ-A5: It MUST be possible to delete existing conference policy.
   This results in terminating the conference, deleting conference URI
   and releasing all resources associated with it.

   REQ-A6: It SHOULD be possible to anonymously participate in a
   conference.

   REQ-A7: It SHOULD be possible to participate in a conference as a
   hidden user. Hidden user is present in a conference, but his presense
   is not revealed.

   conference, one for each call signaling protocol that the conference
   server supports.

6.2 Manipulating general conference attributes

   conference session description (as used e.g. in SDP i line).  This
   can be per session or per media.

   REQ-B7: It SHOULD be possible to set, modify and delete the parameter
   for max number of conference participants. This defines how many
   users at max can be present at the same time.

   REQ-B8: It MUST be possible to hide conference related information
   from non-privileged users.

   REQ-B9: It MUST be possible to inactive a conference for defined
   period of time.

   REQ-B10: It SHOULD be possible to set, modify and delete conference
   Keywords. (This may be useful e.g. for search engines).

6.3 Authentication and Security

   REQ-C1: It MUST be possible to define appropriate authentication for
   joining users.

   REQ-C2: It MUST be possible to use sips: scheme as a conference URI.

Internet-Draft                  CPCP-req                   December 2003


   REQ-E6: It MUST be possible to use wildcards in ACL (such as
   sip:*@example.com is allowed to join).

   REQ-E7: ACL conflicts MUST be solved in a well-defined way (e.g. what
   if user appears both in blocked list and in allowed list) e.g. by
   mandating the order in which ACL definitions are evaluated (e.g. most
   specific expression first).

   REQ-E8: Conference MUST have default policy for those users that no
   matching rule is found in ACL.

   REQ-E9: It MUST be possible to allow and disallow anonymous
   membership in a conference.

   REQ-E10: It MUST be possible to allow and disallow hidden membership
   in a conference.

6.6 Floor control

   REQ-F1: It MUST be possible to assign and de-assign the users who are
   allowed to manipulate floor policy.

6.7 Inviting and ejecting users

   REQ-G1: It MUST be possible to define a dial-out list of users that
   the conference focus invites.

   REQ-G2: It MUST be possible to set a dial-out list in a single
   operation.

   REQ-G3: It MUST be possible to expel users from a currently occurring
   conference.

   REQ-G4: It MUST be possible to expel many users in a single
   operation.

   REQ-G5: It SHOULD be possible to define list of users who the focus
   should refer to the conference (so that the referred users will dial
   in the conference).

   REQ-G6: It SHOULD be possible to set the list of referred users in a
   single operation.

6.8 User Privileges

   REQ-H1: It MUST be possible to give a privilege to a user.

   REQ-H2: It MUST be possible to give privileges to many users in a

Internet-Draft                  CPCP-req                   December 2003


   single operation.

   REQ-H3: It MUST be possible to remove a privilege from a user.

   REQ-H4: It MUST be possible to remove privileges from many users in a
   single operation.

   REQ-H5: It SHOULD be possible to define users who are allowed to
   subscribe to conference event package [4]

6.9 General Protocol Requirements

   REQ-CP-1: Protocol behaviour:  CPCP protocol MUST be a reliable
   client-server protocol. Hence, it MUST have a positive response
   indicating that the request has been received, or error response if
   an error has occurred.

   REQ-CP-2: Manipulations of the policy collection MUST exhibit the
   ACID property; that is, they MUST be atomic, be consistent, durable,
   and operate independently.

   REQ-CP-3: It MAY be possible for the client to batch multiple
   operations (such as add a user to ACL blocked list, or remove a user
   from ACL allowed list) into a single request that is processed
   atomically.

   REQ-CP-4: It MUST be possible for the server to authenticate the
   client.

   REQ-CP-5: It MUST be possible for the client to authenticate the
   server.

   REQ-CP-6: It MUST be possible for message integrity to be ensured
   between the client and the server.

   REQ-CP-7: It MUST be possible for privacy to be ensured between the
   client and server.
