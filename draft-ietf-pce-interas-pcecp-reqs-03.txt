Abstract 
    
   Multiprotocol Label Switching Traffic Engineered (MPLS-TE) Label 
   Switched Paths (LSPs) may be established wholly within an Autonomous 
   System (AS) or may cross AS boundaries. 
    
   The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a component that is capable of 
   computing paths for MPLS-TE LSPs. The PCE Communication 
   Protocol(PCECP) is defined to allow communication between Path 
   Computation Clients (PCCs) and PCEs, and between PCEs. The PCECP is 
   used to request paths and to supply computed paths in responses. 
   Generic requirements for the PCEP are set out in "Path Computation 
   Element(PCE) Communication Protocol Generic Requirements", RFC 4657. 
   This document extends those requirements to cover the use of PCEP in 
   support of inter-AS MPLS-TE.

1. Introduction 
 
   [RFC4216] defines the scenarios motivating the deployment of inter-
   AS Multiprotocol Label Switching Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) and 
   specifies the requirements for inter-AS MPLS-TE when the ASes are 
   under the administration of one Service Provider (SP) or the 
   administration of different SPs. 
 
   Three signaling options are defined for setting up an inter-AS TE 
   LSP: 
       1) contiguous TE LSP as documented in [INTERD-TESIG]; 
       2) stitched inter-AS TE LSP discussed in [LSP-STITCHING]; 
       3) nested TE LSP as in [RFC4206]. 
 
   [INTERD-TE-PDPC] defines mechanisms for the computation of inter-
   domain TE LSPs using network elements along the signaling paths to 
   compute per-domain path segments. The mechanisms in [INTERD-TE-PDPC] 
   do not guarantee an optimum path across multiple ASes where an 
   optimum path for an LSP is one that has the smallest cost, according 
   to a normalized TE metric (based upon a TE-metric or IGP metric 
   adopted in each transit AS) among all possible paths that satisfy 
   the LSP TE-constraints.  
 
   The Path Computation Element (PCE) [RFC4655] is a component that is 
   capable of computing paths for MPLS-TE LSPs. The requirements for a 
   PCE have come from Service Provider (SP) demands to compute optimum 
   paths across multiple areas and/or domains, and to be able to 
   separate the path computation elements from the forwarding elements. 
 
   The PCE Communication Protocol (PCECP) is defined to allow 
   communication between Path Computation Clients (PCCs) and PCEs, and 
   between PCEs. The PCECP is used to request paths and to supply 
   computed paths in responses. Generic requirements for the PCECP are 
   discussed in [RFC4657]. This document provides a set of PCECP 
   requirements that are specific to MPLS-TE inter-AS path computation. 
 
2. Definitions    
 
   This document adopts the definitions and acronyms defined in Section 
   3 of [RFC4216] and Section 2 of [RFC4655]. In addition, we use the 
   following terminology:

Internet Draft draft-ietf-pce-interas-pecp-reqs-03   July 2007 


   PCECP: PCE Communication Protocol  
 
   Inter-AS (G)MPLS-TE path: An MPLS-TE or Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) 
   path that traverses two or more ASes. 
 
   Intra-AS (G)MPLS-TE path: An MPLS-TE or GMPLS path that is confined 
   to a single AS. It may traverse one or more IGP areas. 
 
   Intra-AS PCE: A PCE responsible for computing MPLS-TE or GMPLS paths 
   remaining within a single AS. 
 
   Inter-AS PCE: A PCE responsible for computing inter-AS MPLS-TE or 
   GMPLS paths or path segments, possibly by cooperating with intra-AS 
   PCEs.  
 
3. Reference Model    
    
   Figure 1 depicts the reference model for PCEs in an inter-AS 
   application. We refer to two types of PCE functions in this 
   document: inter-AS PCEs and intra-AS PCEs. Inter-AS PCEs perform the 
   procedures needed for inter-AS MPLS-TE or GMPLS path computation 
   while intra-AS PCEs perform the functions needed for intra-AS MPLS-
   TE or GMPLS path computation. 
    
   Lets follow a scenario that illustrates the interaction among PCCs, 
   inter-AS PCEs and intra-AS PCEs shown Figure 1. R1 in AS1 wants to 
   setup a MPLS-TE or a GMPLS path, call LSP1, with certain constraints 
   to R7 in AS3. R1 determines using mechanisms out of the scope of 
   this document that R7 is an inter-AS route and that it needs to 
   contact its Inter-AS PCE1 to compute the path. R1, as a PCC, sends a 
   PCECP path request to PCE1. PCE1 determines that R7 is reachable via 
   AS2 and that PCE2 is the PCE to ask for path computation across AS2. 
   PCE1 sends a PCECP path request to PCE2. Inter-AS PCE2, in turn, 
   sends a PCECP path request to Intra-AS PCE R4 to compute a path 
   within AS2 (In certain cases, the same router such R3 can assume 
   both inter-AS and intra-AS path computation functions). R4 returns a 
   PCECP path response to PCE2 with ASBR3 as the entry point to AS2 
   from AS1 and ASBR7 as the exit point to AS3. PCE2 then sends a PCECP 
   path request to PCE3 to compute the path segment across AS3, 
   starting at ASBR7 and terminating at R7. PCE3 returns a PCECP path 
   response to PCE2 with the path segment ASBR7-R7. PCE2 then return 
   path ASBR3-ASBR7-R7 to PCE1 which, in turn, returns path ASBR1-
   ASBR3-ASBR7-R7 to PCC R1. 
    
   As described in the above scenario, in general, a PCC may contact an 
   inter-AS PCE to request an inter-AS path, and that PCE may supply

   the path itself, or may solicit the services of other PCEs which 
   may, themselves be inter-AS PCEs, or may be intra-AS PCEs with the 
   responsibility for computing path segments within just one AS. 
    
   This document describes the PCE Communication Protocol requirements 
   for inter-AS path computation. That is, for PCCs to communicate path 
   requests for inter-AS paths to a PCE, and for the PCE to respond. It 
   also includes the requirements for PCEs to communicate inter-AS path 
   requests and responses.

4. Detailed PCECP Requirements for Inter-AS Computation    
 
   This section discusses detailed PCECP requirements for inter-AS 
   MPLS-TE and GMPLS LSPs. Depending on the deployment environment, 
   some or all of the requirements described here may be utilized. 
   Specifically, some requirements are more applicable to inter-
   provider inter-AS MPLS-TE and GMPLS operations than to intra-
   provider operations. 
 
4.1. PCE Communication Protocol Requirements      
 
   Requirements specific to inter-AS PCECP path computation requests 
   and responses are discussed in the following sections. 
 
4.1.1.  Requirements for path computation requests        
 
   The following are inter-AS specific requirements for PCECP requests 
   for path computation: 
    
 
Bitar, Zhang, and Kumaki   Inter-AS Requirements for PCECP [Page 5] 
  
 
  
                                                                       
  
Internet Draft draft-ietf-pce-interas-pecp-reqs-03   July 2007 


   1. [RFC4657] states the requirement for a priority level to be 
   associated with each path computation request. This document does 
   not change that requirement, but, in addition, it MUST be possible 
   for an inter-AS PCE to apply local policy to vary the priority of 
   path computation requests received across AS borders. PCECP MAY 
   include a mechanism to inform the requesting inter-AS PCE of the 
   change in priority that was applied. 
    
   2. A path computation request by an inter-AS PCE or a PCC to another 
   inter-AS PCE MUST be able to specify the sequence of ASes and/or 
   ASBRs across the network by providing ASBRs and/or ASes as hops in 
   the desired path of the LSP to the destination. For instance, an 
   inter-AS PCE MUST be be able to specify to the inter-AS PCE serving 
   the neighboring AS a preferred ASBR for exiting to that AS and reach 
   the destination. That is, where multiple ASBRs exist, the requester 
   MUST be able to indicate a non-mandatory preference for one of them.  
            
   3. PCECP MUST allow a requester to provide a list of ASes and/or 
   ASBRs to be excluded from the computed path. 
    
   4. A PCECP path request from one inter-AS PCE to another MUST 
   include the previous AS number in the path of the LSP to enable the 
   correct application of local policy at the second inter-AS PCE. 
    
   5. A path computation request from a PCC to an inter-AS PCE or an 
   inter-AS PCE to another MUST be able to specify the need for 
   protection against node, link, or SRLG failure using 1:1 detours or 
   facility backup. It MUST be possible to request protection across 
   all ASes or across specific ASes. 
    
   6. The disjoint path requirements specified in [RFC4657] are 
   extended such that it MUST be possible to apply a constraint of AS-
   diversity in the computation of a set of two or more paths. 
    
   7. A PCECP path computation request message MUST be able to identify 
   the scope of diversified path computation to be end-to-end (i.e., 
   between the endpoints of the (G)MPLS-TE tunnel) or to be limited to 
   a specific AS.  
 
4.1.2. Requirements for path computation responses       
      
   The following are inter-AS specific requirements for PCECP responses  
   for path computation:  
  
   1. A PCECP path computation response from one inter-AS PCE to 
   another MUST be able to include both ASBRs and ASes in the computed 
   path while preserving path segment and topology confidentiality.   
 
Bitar, Zhang, and Kumaki   Inter-AS Requirements for PCECP [Page 6] 
  
 
  
                                                                       
  
Internet Draft draft-ietf-pce-interas-pecp-reqs-03   July 2007 


 
   2. A PCECP path computation response from one inter-AS PCE to the 
   requesting inter-AS PCE MUST be able to carry an identifier for a
   path segment it computes to preserve path segment and topology 
   confidentiality. The objective of the identifier is to be included
   in the LSP signaling, whose mechanism is out of scope of this
   document, to be used for path expansion during LSP signaling. 
 
   3. If a constraint for a desired ASBR (see Section 4.1.1, 
   requirement 3) cannot be satisfied by a PCE, PCECP SHOULD allow the
   PCE to notify the requester of that fact as an error in a path
   computation response. 
 
   4. A PCECP path computation from an inter-AS PCE to a requesting 
   inter-AS PCE or a PCC MUST be able to carry a cumulative inter-AS
   path cost. Path cost normalization across ASes is out of scope of
   this document. 
 
   5. A PCECP path computation response from an inter-AS PCE to a PCC 
   SHOULD be able to carry the intra-AS cost of the path segment within 
   the PCC AS. 
    
   6. A PCECP path computation response MUST be able to identify 
   diversified paths for the same (G)MPLS-TE LSP. End-to-end (i.e., 
   between the two endpoints of the (G)MPLS-TE tunnel) disjoint paths
   are paths that do not share nodes, links or SRLGs except for the LSP
   head-end and tail-end. In cases where diversified path segments are
   desired within one or more ASes, the disjoint path segments may
   share only the ASBRs of the first AS and the ASBR of the last AS
   across these ASes.  
 
4.2.  Scalability and Performance Considerations      
      
   PCECP design for use in the inter-AS case SHOULD consider the
   following criteria: 
 
   - PCE message processing load. 
   - Scalability as a function of the following parameters:  
   - number of PCCs within the scope of an inter-AS PCE   
   - number of intra-AS PCEs within the scope of an inter-AS PCE  
   - number of peering inter-AS PCEs per inter-AS PCE 
   - Added complexity caused by inter-AS features.

Internet Draft draft-ietf-pce-interas-pecp-reqs-03   July 2007 


4.3.  Management Considerations      
 
   [RFC4657] specifies generic requirements for PCECP management. This 
   document addresses new requirements that apply to inter-AS
   perations. 
        
   The PCECP MIB module MUST provide objects to control the behavior of 
   PCECP in inter-AS applications.  They include the ASes within the 
   scope of an inter-AS PCE, Inter-AS PCEs in neighboring ASes to which 
   the requesting PCE will or will not communicate, confidentiality and 
   policies, etc.. 
         
   The built-in diagnostic tools MUST enable failure detection and 
   status checking of PCC/PCE-PCE PCECP. Diagnostic tools include 
   statistics collection on the historical behavior of PCECP as 
   specified in [RFC4657], but additionally it MUST be possible to 
   analyze this statistics on a neighboring AS basis (i.e., across the 
   inter-AS PCEs that belong to a neighboring AS).  
 
   The MIB module MUST support trap functions when thresholds are 
   crossed or when important events occur as stated in [RFC4657]. These 
   thresholds SHOULD be specifiable per neighbor AS as well as per peer 
   inter-AS PCE and traps should be accordingly generated.  
 
   Basic liveliness detection for PCC/PCE-PCE PCECP is described in 
   [RFC4657]. The  PCECP MIB module SHOULD allow control of liveliness 
   check behavior by providing a liveliness message frequency MIB 
   object and this frequency object SHOULD be specified per inter-AS 
   PCE peer. In addition, there SHOULD be a MIB object that specifies 
   the dead-interval as a multiplier of the liveliness message 
   frequency so that if no liveliness message is received within that 
   time from an inter-A PCE, the inter-AS PCE is declared unreachable. 
 
4.4.  Confidentiality      
 
   Confidentiality mainly applies to inter-provider (inter-AS) PCE 
   communication. It is about protecting the information exchanged
   between PCEs and about protecting the topology information within
   a provider's network. Confidentiality rules may also apply among
   ASes under a single provider. Each SP will in most cases designate
   some PCEs for inter-AS MPLS-TE or GMPLS path computation within its
   own administrative domain and some other PCEs for inter-provider
   inter-AS MPLS-TE or GMPLS path computation. Among the
   inter-provider-scoped inter-AS PCEs in each SP

   domain, there may also be a subset of the PCEs specifically enabled
   for path computation across a specific set of ASes of different peer
   SPs. 
 
   PCECP SHOULD allow an SP to hide from other SPs the set of hops 
   within its own ASes that are traversed by an inter-AS inter-provider 
   LSP (c.f., Section 5.2.1 of [RFC4216]). In a multi-SP administrative 
   domain environment, SPs may want to hide their network topologies 
   for security or commercial reasons. Thus, for each inter-AS LSP path 
   segment an inter-AS PCE computes, it may return to the requesting 
   inter-AS PCE an inter-AS TE LSP path segment from its own ASes 
   without detailing the explicit intra-AS hops. As stated earlier, 
   PCECP responses SHOULD be able to carry path-segment identifiers 
   that replace the details of that path segment. The potential use of 
   that identifier for path expansion, for instance, during LSP 
   signaling is out of scope of this document. 
 
4.5.  Policy Controls Affecting inter-AS PCECP      
 
   Section 5.2.2 of [RFC4216] discusses the policy control requirements 
   for inter-AS RSVP-TE signaling at the AS boundaries for the
   enforcement of interconnect agreements, attribute/parameter
   translation and security hardening. 
 
   This section discusses those policy control requirements that are 
   similar to what are discussed in section 5.2.2 of [RFC4216] for 
   PCECP. Please note that SPs may still require policy controls during 
   signaling of LSPs to enforce their bilateral or multi-lateral 
   agreements at AS boundaries, but signaling is out of scope for this 
   document. 
 
4.5.1.  Inter-AS PCE Peering Policy Controls        
 
   An inter-AS PCE sends path computation requests to its neighboring 
   inter-AS PCEs, and an inter-AS PCE that receives such a request 
   enforces policies applicable to the sender of the request. These 
   policies may include rewriting some of the parameters, or rejecting 
   requests based on parameter values. Such policies may be applied for 
   PCEs belonging to different SPs or to PCEs responsible for ASes
   within a single SP administrative domain. Parameters that might be
   subject to policy include bandwidth, setup/holding priority, Fast

   For path computation requests that are not compliant with locally 
   configured policies, PCECP SHOULD enable a PCE to send an error 
   message to the requesting PCC or PCE indicating that the request has 
   been rejected because a specific parameter did not satisfy the local 
   policy. 
 
4.5.2.  Inter-AS PCE Reinterpretation Policies        
 
   Each SP may have different definitions in its use of, for example,
   DS-TE TE classes. An inter-AS PCE receiving a path computation
   request needs to interpret the parameters and constraints and adapt
   them to the local environment. Specifically, a request constructed
   by a PCC or PCE in one AS may have parameters and constraints that
   should be interpreted differently by the receiving PCE that is in
   a different AS. A list of signaling parameters subject to policy
   reinterpretation at AS borders can be found in section 5.2.2.2 of
   [RFC4216], and the list for path computation request parameters and
   constraints is the same. In addition, the transit SPs along the
   inter-AS TE path may be GMPLS transport providers which may require
   reinterpretation of MPLS specific PCECP path request objects to
   enable path computation over a GMPLS network. 
 
5.  Security Considerations    
    
   Security concerns arise between any two communicating 
   PCC/PCEs especially when they belong to different administrative       
   entities. Security concerns that need to be addressed are for    
   communication among inter-AS PCEs and other PCEs in a single SP 
   administrative domain as well among inter-AS PCEs under different SP 
   administrative domains. [RFC4657] specifies requirements on PCECP to 
   protect against spoofing, snooping and DoS attacks. These
   requirements become especially critical in the multi-AS case.  
    
   Additionally, two aspects of operations specific to inter-AS PCEs 
   require careful security considerations.  There are two modes of 
   determining peering PCEs across the AS boundary manual 
   configuration and auto-discovery.  In the manual mode, mechanisms 
   for securely exchanging manually confgiured authentication key or 
   key sets across SP boundaries MUST be defined.  For example, the
   authentication key May be manually configured for each PCE peer and
   PCE registration MAY be served as a mechanism for securely
   exchanging authentication keys across SP boundaries.  In the 
   auto-discovery mode, inter-as PCEs can be auto-discovered only if
   it is configured to participate in that discovery scope.

   An inter-AS PCE is not necessarily able to establish PCEP sessions
   with the discovered PCEs in its scope(s), it MUST be able to 
   authenticate with the peering inter-AS PCE, therefore mechanisms 
   for securely exchanging authentication keys across SP boundaries 
   MUST also be defined in this case.  Furthermore, the auto-discovery 
   process itself MUST also be authenticated.
