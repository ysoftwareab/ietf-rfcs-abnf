        Single Area Border RBridge Nickname for TRILL Multilevel
          draft-zhang-trill-multilevel-single-nickname-00.txt

Abstract

   A major issue in multilevel TRILL is how to manage RBridge nicknames.
   In this document, the area border RBridge uses a single nickname in
   both Level 1 and Level 2. RBridges in Level 2 must obtain unique
   nicknames but RBridges in different Level 1 areas may have the same
   nicknames.

1. Introduction

   TRILL multilevel techniques are designed to improve TRILL scalability
   issues. As described in [MultiL], there have been two proposed
   approaches. One approach, which is referred as the "unique nickname"
   approach, gives unique nicknames to all the TRILL switches in the
   multilevel campus, either by having the Level-1/Level-2 border TRILL
   switches advertise which nicknames are not available for assignment
   in the area, or by partitioning the 16-bit nickname into an "area"
   field and a "nickname inside the area" field.  The other approach,
   which is referred as the "aggregated nickname" approach, involves
   assigning nicknames to the areas, and allowing nicknames to be reused
   in different areas, by having the border TRILL switches rewrite the
   nickname fields when entering or leaving an area.

   The approach specified in this document is different from both
   "unique nickname" and "aggregated nickname" approach. In this
   document, the nickname of an area border RBridge is used in both
   Level 1 (L1) and Level 2 (L2). No additional nicknames are assigned

   to the L1 areas. Each L1 area is denoted by the group of all
   nicknames of those border RBridges of the area. For this approach,
   nicknames in L2 MUST be unique but nicknames inside different L1
   areas MAY be reused.

3. Nickname Handling on Border RBridges

   This section provides an illustrative example and description of the
   border learning border RBridge nicknames.

           Area {2,20}             level 2             Area {3,30}
   +-------------------+     +-----------------+     +--------------+
   |                   |     |                 |     |              |
   | S--RB27---Rx--Rz----RB2---Rb---Rc--Rd---Re--RB3---Rk--RB44---D |
   |     27            |     |                 |     |     44       |
   |                 ----RB20---             ----RB30---            |
   +-------------------+     +-----------------+     +--------------+

          Figure 3.1: An example topology for TRILL multilevel

   In Figure 3.1, RB2, RB20, RB3 and RB30 are area border TRILL switches
   (RBridges). Their nicknames are 2, 20, 3 and 30 respectively. Area
   border RBridges use the set of border nicknames to denote the L1 area
   that they are attached to. For example, RB2 and RB20 use nicknames
   {2,20} to denote the L1 area on the left.

   A source S is attached to RB27 and a destination D is attached to
   RB44. RB27 has a nickname, say 27, and RB44 has a nickname, say 44
   (and in fact, they could even have the same nickname, since the TRILL
   switch nickname will not be visible outside these Level 1 areas).

3.1. Actions on Unicast Packets
 


Mingui Zhang, et al    Expires September 10, 2015               [Page 3]

INTERNET-DRAFT      Single Nickname Multiple Levels        March 9, 2015


   Let's say that S transmits a frame to destination D and let's say
   that D's location is learned by the relevant TRILL switches already.
   These relevant switches have learned the following:

   1) RB27 has learned that D is connected to nickname 3.
   2) RB3 has learned that D is attached to nickname 44.

   The following sequence of events will occur:

   -  S transmits an Ethernet frame with source MAC = S and destination
      MAC = D.

   -  RB27 encapsulates with a TRILL header with ingress RBridge = 27,
      and egress RBridge = 3 producing a TRILL Data packet.

   -  RB2 and RB20 have announced in the Level 1 IS-IS instance in area
      {2,20}, that they are attached to all those area nicknames,
      including {3,30}. Therefore, IS-IS routes the packet to RB2 (or
      RB20, if RB20 on the least-cost route from RB27 to RB3).

   -  RB2, when transitioning the packet from Level 1 to Level 2,
      replaces the ingress TRILL switch nickname with its own nickname,
      so replaces 27 with 2. Within Level 2, the ingress RBridge field
      in the TRILL header will therefore be 2, and the egress RBridge
      field will be 3. Also RB2 learns that S is attached to nickname 27
      in area {2,20} to accommodate return traffic. RB2 SHOULD
      synchronize with RB20 that MAC = S is attached to nickname 27.

   -  The packet is forwarded through Level 2, to RB3, which has
      advertised, in Level 2, its L2 nickname as 3.

   -  RB3, when forwarding into area {3,30}, replaces the egress
      nickname in the TRILL header with RB44's nickname (44). The
      ingress nickname MAY be replaced with an area nickname selected
      from {2,20}. See Section 4 for the detail of the selection method.
      Suppose nickname 2 is selected. So, within the destination area,
      the ingress nickname will be 2 and the egress nickname will be 44.

   -  RB44, when decapsulating, learns that S is attached to nickname 2,
      which is one of the area nicknames of the ingress.

3.2. Actions on Multi-Destination Packets

   Now suppose that D's location has not been learned by RB27 and/or
   RB3. What will happen, as it would in TRILL today, is that RB27 will
   forward the packet as multi-destination, choosing a tree. As the
   multi-destination packet transitions into Level 2, RB2 replaces the
   ingress nickname with its own nickname for the area. If RB27 does not
 


Mingui Zhang, et al    Expires September 10, 2015               [Page 4]

INTERNET-DRAFT      Single Nickname Multiple Levels        March 9, 2015


   know the location of D, the packet must be flooded, subject to
   possible pruning, in Level 2 and, subject to possible pruning, from
   Level 2 into every Level 1 area that it reaches on the Level 2
   distribution tree. There may be multiple eligible border RBridges for
   this area to transit the multi-destination packets from Level 2 to a
   Level 1. It's important that these area border RBridges agree on an
   election method to determine who is the Designated Boarder RBridge
   (DBRB) for the transition, otherwise RBridges in this area will see
   packet duplication. It's RECOMMNEDED that the pseudorandom algorithm
   as defined in Section 5.3 of [RFC7357] is used as the election
   method.

   Now suppose that RB27 has learned the location of D (attached to
   nickname 3), but RB3 does not know where D is. In that case, RB3 must
   turn the packet into a multi-destination packet within area {3,30}.
   In this case, care must be taken so that, another border TRILL switch
   in that area not forward the now multi-destination packet back into
   Level 2. Therefore, it would be desirable to have a marking, somehow,
   that indicates the scope of this packet's distribution to be "only
   this area" (see also Section 4 of [MultiL]).

4. Per-flow Load Balancing

   When a packet from other areas arrives at an area border RBridge,
   this RBridge MAY select one area nickname of the ingress to replace
   the ingress nickname of the packet. The selection is simply based on
   a pseudorandom algorithm as defined in Section 5.3 of [RFC7357]. With
   the random ingress nickname replacement, the border RBridge actually
   achieves a per-flow load balance for returning traffic. 

   All area border RBridges in an L1 area MUST agree on the same
   pseudorandom algorithm. The source MAC address, ingress area
   nicknames, egress area nicknames and the Data Label are candidate
   factors of the input of this pseudorandom algorithm. Note that the
   value of the destination MAC address SHOULD be excluded from the
   input of this pseudorandom algorithm, otherwise the egress RBridge
   will see one source MAC address flip flopping among multiple ingress
   RBridges.

   When a packet originated from an area arrives at the area border
   RBridge, this RBridge MAY select one area nickname of the egress to
   replace the egress nickname of the packet. By default, it SHOULD
   choose the egress area border RBridge with the least cost route to
   reach. The pseudorandom algorithm as defined in Section 5.3 of
   [RFC7357] may be used as well. In that case, however, the ingress
   area border RBridge may take the non-least-cost Level 2 route to
   forward the TRILL data packet to the egress area border RBridge.

5. Protocol Extensions for Discovery

5.1. Discovery of Border RBridges in L1

   The following Level 1 Border RBridge APPsub-TLV will be included in
   an E-L1FS FS-LSP fragment zero [RFC7180bis] as an APPsub-TLV of the
   TRILL GENINFO-TLV. Through listening to this Appsub-TLV, an area
   border RBridge discovers all other area border RBridges in this area.

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Type = L1-BORDER-RBRIDGE      | (2 bytes)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Length                        | (2 bytes)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Sender Nickname               | (2 bytes)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   o  Type: Level 1 Border RBridge (TRILL APPsub-TLV type tbd1)

   o  Length: 2

   o  Sender Nickname: The nickname the originating IS will use as the
      L1 Border RBridge nickname. This field is useful because the
      originating IS might own multiple nicknames.

5.2. Discovery of Border RBridge Sets in L2

   The following APPsub-TLV will be included in an E-L2FS FS-LSP
   fragment zero [RFC7180bis] as an APPsub-TLV of the TRILL GENINFO-TLV.
   Through listening to this APPsub-TLV in L2, an area border RBridge
   discovers all groups of L1 border RBridges and each such group
   identifies an area.

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Type = L1-BORDER-RB-GROUP     | (2 bytes)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | L1 Border RBridge Nickname k  | (2 bytes)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   o  Type: Level 1 Border RBridge Group (TRILL APPsub-TLV type tbd2)

   o  Length: 2*k. If length is not a multiple of 2, the APPsub-TLV is

      corrupt and MUST be ignored.


   o  L1 Border RBridge Nickname: The nickname that an area border
      RBridge uses as the L1 Border RBridge nickname. The L1-BORDER-RB-
      GROUP TLV generated by an area border RBridge MUST include all L1
      Border RBridge nicknames of the area. It's RECOMMENDED that these
      k nicknames are ordered in ascending order according to the 2-
      octet nickname considered as an unsigned integer.


6. E-L1FS/E-L2FS Backwards Compatibility

   All Level 2 RBridges MUST support E-L2FS [RFC7356] [rfc7180bis]. The
   Extended TLVs defined in Section 5 are to be used in Extended Level
   1/2 Flooding Scope (E-L1FS/E-L2FS) PDUs. Area border RBridges MUST
   support both E-L1FS and E-L2FS. RBridges that do not support either
   E-L1FS or E-L2FS cannot serve as area border RBridges but they can
   well appear in an L1 area acting as non-area-border RBridges.

7. Security Considerations

   For general TRILL Security Considerations, see [RFC6325].

   The newly defined TRILL APPsub-TLVs in Section 5 are transported in
   IS-IS PDUs whose authenticity can be enforced using regular IS-IS
   security mechanism [ISIS][RFC5310]. This document raises no new
   security issues for IS-IS.

8. IANA Considerations

8.1. TRILL APPsub-TLVs

   IANA is requested to allocate two new types under the TRILL GENINFO
   TLV [RFC7357] for the TRILL APPsub-TLVs defined in Section 5. The
   following entries are added to the "TRILL APPsub-TLV Types under IS-
   IS TLV 251 Application Identifier 1" Registry on the TRILL Parameters
   IANA web page.

      Type       Name                     Reference
      ---------  ----                     ---------
      tbd1[256]  L1-BORDER-RBRIDGE        [This document]
