Abstract

    This memo documents an extension to OSPF to allow a single physical
    link to be shared by multi-areas. This is necessary to allow the 
    link to be considered as an intra-area link in multiple areas and
    be preferred over high cost intra-area paths. Unlike existing 
    mechanisms, this extension does not require additional layer 2 
    encapsulations or secondary addresses.

1.  Motivation

    In OSPF routing domains, it is common for the OSPF backbone links 
    to be higher bandwidth than the non-backbone links. It is also 
    common for non-backbone areas to be connected via multiple ABRs 
    which are also connected by backbone links. For example:

         R5    
         |       Area 0      
         |
         R1 ------- Area 0 --------- R2
         |           Oc48            |
        Area 1                    Area 1   
         Oc3        Area 1          Oc3
         |                           |
        R3----------Area 1 --------- R4 
                     DS1             |
                                     N1


    The backbone Oc48 link connecting R1 and R2 in area 0 is clearly
    the highest bandwidth and lower cost path between R1 and N4. 
    However, the path R1->R3->R4->N1 will be preferred since it is 
    an Area 1 intra-area path. In this situation, one would like the 
    higher bandwidth link between R1 and R2 to be treated as a link 
    in both Area 1 and Area 0.

2.  Proposed Solution

    For numbered interfaces, the OSPF specification [OSPF] allows a 
    separate OSPF interface to be configured in each area using a 
    secondary address. The disadvantages of this approach are that 
    this doesn't apply to unnumbered interfaces and advertising 
    secondary addresses will result in a larger overall routing table.

    Allowing a link with a single address to simply be configured in 
    multiple areas would also solve the problem. However, this would 
    result in the subnet corresponding to the interface residing in 
    multiple areas which is contrary to the definition of an OSPF 
    area as a collection of subnets.  

    The above problems can be avoided by simply allowing unnumbered 
    links to be configured in multiple areas. This will allow a 
    higher bandwidth link to be used in multiple areas without using 
    additonal layer 2 encapsulations or secondary addresses. Section  
    8.2. of the OSPF specification already specifies that the OSPF 
    area ID should be used to de-multiplex received OSPF packets. 

    One limitation is that multi-access networks are not supported.
    However, this limitation may be overcome for LAN media with
    support of "Point-to-Point operation over LAN in link-state
    routing protocols" [P2PLAN].

3.  Backward compatibility

    This proposal does not introduce any backward compatibility
    issues with to other routers in the OSPF routing domain or area. 
    For interoperability, both endpoints of the link must support
    allow configuration in multiple areas.

4.  Other Solutions

    The "OSPF Tunnel Adjacency" [OSPFTA] describes a more elaborate 
    mechanism which satisfies this requirement as well as others. 

5. Security Considerations

    The described technique does not introduce any new security issues
    into OSPF protocol.
