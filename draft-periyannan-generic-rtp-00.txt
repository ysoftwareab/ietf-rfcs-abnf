Abstract

   This document specifies a method for delivering generic media streams
   over the Realtime Transport Protocol (RTP). This proposal is intended
   for media or codec types that are not already handled by other RTP
   payload specifications. Three packetization schemes are defined for
   carrying the media data. The Session Description Protocol (SDP) is
   used to convey to receivers the packetization scheme used, the media
   data encoding format and parameters for the media encoding format.

1 Introduction

   This document defines a method for delivering generic media streams
   over the Realtime Transport Protocol (RTP) [1]. RTP is a protocol
   designed to carry realtime media data along with synchronization
   information over a datagram protocol (usually UDP over IP). The
   protocol itself does not address the encapsulation of specific media
   types, but instead leaves it to various profile and payload format

   specifications. An accompanying RTP profile document [2] contains
   various payload specifications to carry audio and video over RTP for
   conferencing applications and specifies the static payload types for
   each  audio/video compression scheme.

   The RTP payload specifications available today are limited to a few
   audio compression schemes such as PCM, GSM and DVI [2] and a few
   video compression schemes such as JPEG, MPEG and H.261 [3,4,5]. In
   the current model every new compression scheme requires a new RTP
   payload specification. As we move forward this model is impractical
   since there are many new audio and video codecs that will become
   available. There are also many compression schemes that are already
   available within media file formats and playback architectures such
   as QuickTime, WAV, RealAudio and ASF that do not have RTP payload
   specifications. There are media types such as text and MIDI that are
   not addressed by any RTP payload specification. There needs to be a
   way of carrying all of this media over RTP without having to
   individually come up with payload specifications for each of them.

   Two proposals were made for delivering QuickTime [7] and ASF [8]
   media over RTP that solve the above mentioned problems. These
   proposals solved the primary problem but raised a major concern -
   they were incompatible with each other. They introduced two ways of
   delivering the same media content over RTP. In contrast, this
   proposal illustrates a method for carrying generic media and codec
   types over RTP that is independent of the file format and media
   playback architecture.

   The goals of this proposal can be divided into two categories,

   - define a set of packetization schemes that cover the needs of
   various media types.

   - define a mechanism within SDP to convey the packetization scheme,
   the media encoding format and other parameters for the media encoding
   format.

   Proposals to achieve the above goals are covered in sections 2 and 3
   of this document. Open issues are listed in section 4.

2 RTP Packetization Schemes

   This proposal defines three packetization schemes. They are designed
   to meet the needs of different types of media samples in media
   streams. The scheme used in a given RTP session is agreed upon by the
   senders and receivers through non-RTP means. (Section 3 defines a
   mechanism to convey this information through SDP.)

   For the purposes of this proposal, a media sample is defined as a
   unit of compressed or uncompressed media data with an associated
   duration and timestamp. Audio samples are typically constant size,
   constant duration units of audio data. Video samples are usually
   variable size units of video data refered to as video frames. MIDI
   samples are typically variable size, variable duration units of MIDI
   instructions. Text samples are variable size, variable duration units
   containing text strings usually in Unicode format.

   The choice of which scheme to use on a given RTP session is based on
   the type of stream. More specifically it depends on characteristics
   such as,

   - the duration of each media sample

   - the size of each media sample compared to the Maximum Transmission
   Unit (MTU) size of the underlying network

   - the need for receivers to detect key samples with a mechanism that
   is independent of the encoding format. (Key samples are defined as
   intracoded samples in a media stream that also contains intercoded
   samples.)

   - the need to specify sample durations

   The definition of each packetization scheme in this section is
   preceded by a recommendation on its usage based on the above
   considerations. The three schemes proposed here may not satisfy the
   needs of all the current and future types of media streams. More
   packetization schemes may be added to this list to satisfy changing
   requirements.


2.1 Generic Scheme A

   This packetization scheme is recommended for use with media streams
   with the following characteristics,

   - the duration and size of each media sample is constant

   - the size of each media sample is less than the MTU size of the
   underlying network (after taking into account the RTP header)

   Media streams that typically fall into this category are frame-based
   as well as sample-based compressed or uncompressed audio streams.

   The RTP packet used in Scheme A is formatted as follows:

           +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   The format and general usage of the RTP header fields are described
   in [1]. The following fields of the RTP header will be used as
   specified below:

   - The payload type should specify one of the dynamic payload types
   that should be agreed upon through some non-RTP means.

   - The RTP timestamp is based on a timescale that should be agreed
   upon through some non-RTP means. The timestamp encodes the sampling
   instant of the first media sample contained in the RTP data packet.
   Multiple samples may be contained in one RTP packet. The initial
   value of the timestamp is random (unpredictable) to make known-
   plaintext attacks on encryption more difficult, see RTP [1].

   - The marker bit (M-bit) is unused. Transmitters must set this bit to
   zero. Receivers must ignore this bit.

   The sample data immediately follows the RTP header and contains one
   or more complete media samples.

2.2 Generic Scheme B

   This packetization scheme is recommended for use with media streams
   with the following characteristics,

   - the size of each media sample is variable and typically greater
   than the MTU size of the underlying network (after taking into
   account the RTP header)

   - the duration of each media sample is the difference between its
   timestamp and the timestamp of the next sample or the duration is
   either implicitly or explicitly contained within the sample data.

   - the receivers do not have a need to be able to detect key samples
   using a mechanism that is independent of the encoding format.

   Media streams that typically fall into this category are compressed
   video streams with large frame sizes.

   The RTP packet used in Scheme B is formatted as follows:


           0                   1                   2                   3

           +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   The format and general usage of the RTP header fields are described
   in [1]. The following fields of the RTP header will be used as
   specified below:

   - The payload type should specify one of the dynamic payload types
   that should be agreed upon through some non-RTP means.

   - The RTP timestamp is based on a timescale that should be agreed
   upon through some non-RTP means. The timestamp encodes the sampling
   instant of the media sample contained in the RTP data packet. An RTP
   packet contains a single complete sample or a single sample is
   fragmented over multiple RTP packets. If a media sample occupies more
   than one packet, the timestamp must be the same on all of those
   packets. Packets containing different samples must have different
   timestamps so that samples may be distinguished by the timestamp. The
   initial value of the timestamp is random (unpredictable) to make
   known-plaintext attacks on encryption more difficult, see RTP [1].

   - The marker bit (M-bit) is set to one in the last packet of a sample
   and otherwise, must be zero. If one sample is fully contained within
   an RTP packet the M-bit must be set to one. Thus, it is possible to
   easily detect that a complete sample has been received and can be
   decoded and presented.

   The sample data immediately follows the RTP header and contains one
   complete media sample or a fragment of a media sample.

2.3 Generic Scheme C

   This packetization scheme is recommended for use with media streams
   with the following characteristics,

   - the size of each media sample is variable - some packets are larger
   than the MTU size, but most are much smaller.

   - sometimes the samples require a mechanism outside their encoding



A. Periyannan, D. Singer, M. Speer                              [Page 5]^L





Internet Draft      draft-periyannan-generic-rtp-00        March 13 1998


   format to specify the duration.

   - the receivers have a need to be able to detect key samples using a
   mechanism that is independent of the encoding format.

   Media streams that typically fall into this category are compressed
   video streams with some large frames and many small frames,
   proprietary video streams that have a need for receivers to be able
   to detect key samples and MIDI streams that require duration of a
   sample to be specified.


   The RTP packet used in Scheme C is formatted as follows:


           0                   1                   2                   3

           .                           ......                              .
           +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   The format and general usage of the RTP header fields are described
   in [1]. The following fields of the RTP header will be used as
   specified below:

   - The payload type should specify one of the dynamic payload types
   that should be agreed upon through some non-RTP means.

   - The RTP timestamp is based on a timescale that should be agreed
   upon through some non-RTP means. The timestamp encodes the sampling
   instant of the first media sample contained in the RTP data packet.
   Multiple samples may be contained in one RTP packet or a single
   sample may be fragmented over multiple RTP packets. If a media sample
   occupies more than one packet, the timestamp must be the same on all
   of those packets. Packets containing different samples must have
   different timestamps so that samples may be distinguished by the
   timestamp. The initial value of the timestamp is random

   (unpredictable) to make known-plaintext attacks on encryption more
   difficult, see RTP [1].

   - The marker bit (M-bit) is set to one in the last packet of a sample
   and otherwise, must be zero. If one or more samples are fully
   contained within an RTP packet the M-bit must be set to one. Thus, it
   is possible to easily detect that a complete sample has been received
   and can be decoded and presented.

   The RTP payload contains one of the following,

   - One media sample fragment, i.e. when the sample size is larger than
   the MTU size and hence the sample has to be fragmented over multiple
   packets.

   - One or more complete media samples, i.e. when the sample size is
   smaller than the MTU size and hence one or more media samples can be
   placed in a single RTP packet.

   In both cases each media sample or fragment is preceded by a Scheme C
   header.



   The Scheme C header is defined as follows:


           0                   1                   2                   3
           0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
           +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
           |S|L|R|D|  RES  |                 Length/Offset                 |
           +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
           |                      Relative Timestamp                       |
           +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
           |                          Duration                             |
           +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   The fields in the Scheme C header have the following meanings:

   S bit: 1 bit
   The S-bit is set to one if the sample is a key sample, i.e.
   intracoded sample. Otherwise it is set to zero. The S-bit in all
   headers preceding fragments of the same sample must be set to the
   same value.

   L bit: 1 bit
   The L-bit is set to one if the Length/Offset field contains a length.



A. Periyannan, D. Singer, M. Speer                              [Page 7]^L





Internet Draft      draft-periyannan-generic-rtp-00        March 13 1998


   Otherwise it is set to zero and the Length/Offset field contains an
   offset. The L-bit must be set to one in all headers preceding
   complete samples and must be set to zero in all headers preceding
   sample fragments.

   R bit: 1 bit
   The R-bit is set to one if the header contains a relative timestamp.
   Otherwise it is set to zero. The R-bit in all headers preceding
   fragments of the same sample must be set to the same value.

   D bit: 1 bit
   The D-bit is set to one if the header contains a sample duration.
   Otherwise it is set to zero. The D-bit in all headers preceding
   fragments of the same sample must be set to the same value.

   RES: 8 bits
   Reserved for future use. Transmitters must set these bits to zero.
   Receivers must ignore these bits.

   Length/Offset: 24 bits
   If a single sample is fragmented over multiple packets, the L-bit is
   set to zero and the Length/Offset field contains the byte offset of
   the first byte of this fragment from the beginning of the sample. If
   one or more complete samples are contained in this packet, the L-bit
   is set to one in each Scheme C header, and the Sample Length/Offset
   field contains the length of this sample (including the Scheme C
   header.) The sum of the lengths of all samples in a packet must be
   equal to the RTP payload length. Receivers make use of this
   relationship to ascertain whether there are more samples to extract
   from a packet.

   Relative Timestamp: signed 32 bits
   This field is present only if the R-bit is set to one. It contains
   the relative timestamp for this sample with respect to the timestamp
   in the RTP header. The timescale used is the same as that used for
   the timestamp in the RTP header. This field is specified as a signed
   32-bit number to allow for negative offsets from the RTP header
   timestamp. When this field is absent a default relative timestamp of
   zero is used.

   Duration: 32 bits
   This field is present only if the D-bit is set to one. It contains
   the duration of the sample. The timescale used is the same as that
   used for the timestamp in the RTP header. The Duration in all headers
   preceding fragments of the same sample must be set to the same value.
   When this field is absent the default duration is implicitly or
   explicitly obtained from the sample data. If this is not possible the
   default is the difference between this sample's timestamp and the

Internet Draft      draft-periyannan-generic-rtp-00        March 13 1998


   next sample's timestamp.

   The length of the Scheme C header varies between 4 bytes and 12 bytes
   depending on whether the R and D bits are set. When neither of the
   bits are set the header length is 4 bytes. When only one of them is
   set the header length is 8 bytes. When both bits are set the header
   length is 12 bytes.

3 SDP Usage

   SDP is used as a mechanism to convey to RTP receivers the information
   required to decode and present a set of RTP sessions. SDP can be used
   as an announcement mechanism as described in [9] or can be used as a
   description format with the Real Time Streaming Protocol [6]. In both
   cases, SDP is used to specify the set of RTP sessions being
   transmitted, the media type in each session, the payload format and
   encoding format of each session and other parameters associated with
   each session.

   This proposal defines a set of extensions to the mechanisms already
   defined by SDP. These extensions are used to convey the following
   information:

   - RTP packetization scheme

   - Media sample encoding format

   - Parameters for the media encoding format

   The SDP rtpmap and fmtp attributes are used to convey the above
   information.

3.1 rtpmap Attribute

   The SDP specification [9] currently defines the following format for
   the rtpmap attribute,

   a=rtpmap:<payload type> <encoding name>/<clock rate>[/<encoding
   parameters>]

   The <encoding name> is either a registered IANA name or an
   unregistered name preceded by "X-". Currently, this name specifies
   the encoding format of the media samples and also implicitly
   specifies the packetization scheme used.

   This proposal defines a new usage for the <encoding name> that
   separates the packetization scheme and the media encoding format.
   When the packetization scheme is implicit in the encoding format the



A. Periyannan, D. Singer, M. Speer                              [Page 9]^L





Internet Draft      draft-periyannan-generic-rtp-00        March 13 1998


   optional fields are dropped and the usage becomes identical to the
   old usage of <encoding name>. The <encoding name> is enclosed in
   quotes when it contains the optional fields. All other fields of the
   rtpmap attribute line are used as defined in [9].

   The <encoding name> is defined as follows:

   "[<namespace>/]<encoding format>[,<packetization scheme>]"

   The <encoding format> specifies the encodings used in the media
   samples, i.e. it specifies the compression scheme used for audio or
   video streams or the media type used for other types of streams. The
   optional <packetization scheme> specifies the headers used within the
   RTP payload and the mechanisms used to fragment samples over RTP
   packets.

   The <encoding format> as well as the <packetization scheme> are
   either registered IANA names or unregistered names preceded by "X-".
   The optional <namespace> that precedes the encoding format is used to
   qualify the <encoding format> when the format falls within the scope
   of an encompassing format. The <namespace> is either a registered
   IANA name or an unregistered name preceded by "X-". When a
   <namespace> is present then the <encoding format> falls under the
   scope of the <namespace> and hence is not registered with the IANA.

   The packetization schemes defined in section 2 are named as follows,

   Generic Scheme A           genpak-a
   Generic Scheme B           genpak-b
   Generic Scheme C           genpak-c

   Some examples of the new usage of the rtpmap attribute are presented:

   An RTP session with Intel Indeo video over generic packetization
   scheme B with a timescale (clockrate) of 600:

   a=rtpmap:99 "indeo,genpak-b"/600

   An RTP session with QuickTime MIDI over generic packetization scheme
   C with a timescale of 30:

   a=rtpmap:99 "x-qt/midi,genpak-c"/30

   An RTP session with Microsoft ADPCM audio over generic packetization
   scheme A with a timescale of 8 KHz:

   a=rtpmap:99 "x-qt/twen,x-qtsprite"/600

   This method of using the rtpmap attribute allows for widely available
   proprietary video codecs such as Intel's Indeo to be sent over RTP
   regardless of the file format used to store the content or the
   multimedia architecture used to present it. In addition, the method
   is flexible enough to allow a way to specify proprietary codecs that
   only exist within a proprietary file format or multimedia playback
   architecture. The method also allows new packetization schemes to be
   added independent of new encoding formats.

3.2 fmtp Attribute

   The SDP specification [9] currently defines the following format for
   the fmtp attribute,

   a=fmtp:<format> <format specific parameters>

   <format> is one of the payload types specified for the media, i.e.
   one of the payload types for which there is an rtpmap attribute line.
   The usage of <format specific parameters> is currently undefined in
   the specification.

   This proposal defines that the usage of <format specific
   parameters>is scoped by the <encoding format> specified in the
   corresponding rtpmap attribute for the payload type specified in the
   fmtp line. Thus, if we are sending Intel's Indeo (indeo) over RTP the
   format specific parameters are those defined for Indeo and if we're
   sending QuickTime MIDI (x-qt/midi) over RTP the format specific
   parameters are those defined for QuickTime MIDI.

   The definitions for format specific parameters for a given encoding
   format are beyond the scope of this document.

4 Open Issues

   The following open issues need to be resolved:



A. Periyannan, D. Singer, M. Speer                             [Page 11]^L

   - M-bit usage in scheme A
   The M-bit is currently unused in scheme A. It can be used to indicate
   the first packet after a gap in the RTP timeline.

   - A new rtpmap2
   An attempt was made to keep the rtpmap line as close as possible to
   the current specification. This may not be the best choice. A new
   rtpmap2 will eliminate confusion and parsing problems. (Also, the ","
   delimiter is not widely used in SDP. Should a space be used instead?)

   - Multiple fmtp attribute lines per format
   We may need multiple fmtp lines per format (payload type) for better
   readability. In the current SDP specification it is unclear whether
   this is legally allowed.

   - Binary data in fmtp attribute lines
   When sending proprietary encoding formats over RTP, the format
   specific parameters may need to be transparently conveyed to the
   receiver in binary form. There is currently no mechanism defined in
   SDP to convey binary data.

   - Large SDP files
   The format specific parameters may require more space than the 1
   Kbyte limit in SDP. This limit needs to relaxed.
