       Redirection Service for Registration Data Access Protocol
                     draft-ietf-weirds-redirects-04

Abstract

   The traditional WHOIS protocol has several important shortcomings,
   and over the past few years several approaches to a better
   Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) have been discussed and
   proposed.

   It is worth noting that the term WHOIS is sometimes used
   interchangeably to mean either (a) the registration data itself or
   (b) the protocol used to access registration data

   Among these shortcomings, different registries operate different
   WHOIS services.  For users this means that several WHOIS queries to
   different registries may be necessary in order to obtain data for a
   given resource.

   This document describes a redirection service for RDAP queries.  This
   service allows clients to query a single RDAP service and expect
   either an authoritative answer or a redirection hint pointing to
   another, possibly authoritative, RDAP server.

   The solution implemented proposed here applies to Regional Internet
   Registries(RIRs) and Domain Name Registries(DNRs).

1.  Introduction

   A user interested in obtaining registration information for a given
   number or domain resource normally uses the WHOIS service provided by
   the RIRs and DNRs.

   In order to avoid having to query several databases until obtaining
   an answer, some approaches have been discussed and implemented in the
   past, most notably the Joint WHOIS [lacnic-joint-whois] initiative.
   However, among other shortcomings, Joint WHOIS is implemented using
   proxies and server-side referrals.

   The RDAP protocol (draft-ietf-weirds-using-http [I-D.ietf-weirds-
   using-http]) makes it comparatively easy to implement client-side
   redirects based on normal HTTP 1.1 semantics and behavior.

   The goal of this I-D is to describe an implementation of an RDAP
   redirection service and to encourage discussion on the topic of

   redirects in this problem domain.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.  The REST Approach to Web Services

   While a full introduction to REST and RESTful interfaces is out of
   the scope of this document it is important to note that these
   interfaces employ the verbs defined in HTTP (GET, POST, HEAD, DELETE)
   and HTTP response codes to signal the semantics and outcomes of an
   operation.

   As WHOIS is a read-only service only the GET and HEAD verbs are
   usually implemented.

   HTTP status codes provide signaling for errors and other conditions,
   including the concept of "client-side redirection" as outlined below.

1.3.  Request Redirection for RDAP Queries

   Each RDAP server should answer directly only those queries for which
   it is authoritative.  In this case, being authoritative equals
   "having direct access to a given registry database".

   For all other queries, a RDAP server could provide a 301 MOVED
   PERMANENTLY redirect answer pointing to an URL hosted on a different
   RDAP server.

   As all requests are to be performed employing HTTP GETs, a user agent
   can transparently follow the HTTP 30x redirection hints ([RFC2616])
   until obtaining a non-error answer (HTTP 20x) or an unrecoverable
   error condition (HTTP 40x or 50x).

1.4.  The Redirection Table.  The Bootstrap Problem.

   For the redirection table lookup function, the redirector can either
   have pre-populated local table or have access to a service provided
   by some form of directory service.  How either this local table or
   directory service is fed is known as the "bootstrap problem".

   RDAP Bootstrap is described in draft-ietf-weirds-bootstrap [I-D.ietf-
   weirds-bootstrap]

2.  Architectural Use Cases of Redirects in RDAP

2.1.  A Joint RDAP Tree through HTTP Redirection

   In an scenario where a client does not know which registry can
   provide authoritative answers***TBC

Internet-Draft          RDAP Redirection Service               July 2014


   When an RDAP server receives a query for which it does not have an
   authoritative answer to provide, it MAY provide an HTTP 30x
   redirection message pointing the client to a redirection-only RDAP
   server, which in turn can provide further redirections guiding the
   client to an authoritative server.

   The redirect-only server is responsible for tracking and returning
   the authoritative sources for IP, AS, domain name, name server or
   entity queries.  All the query format are described in the draft-
   ietf-weirds-rdap-query [I-D.ietf-weirds-rdap-query].  We call this
   redirect server "the redirector".

   The redirect server needs access to data sources that, given a
   queried resource, provide a pointer to the authoritative RDAP server.
   For lack of a better name, we will call this data source the
   "redirection table".

   Assuming the redirector has access to a redirection table, the
   following pseudo code describes its expected behaviour:

             while(true) {
                 query = read_query_from_network()
                 auth_rdap_svr = redirect_table_lookup (query.resource)
                 if (auth_rdap_svr != null) {
                      write_http_301(auth_rdap_svr)
                 } else {
                     write_http_404("resource not in redirect table")
                 }
             }

                         Redirector state machine

   Figure 2 shows the general scheme of a single RDAP Redirection
   Service serving three different RIRs standalone RDAPs while providing
   a seamless query interface to clients.

   for registration data for the IPv4 address 23.1.1.1 (administered by
   ARIN) from LACNIC's WHOIS, the redirector and finally ARIN's WHOIS.

                     Querying WHOIS data for 23.1.1.1

2.2.  Helper Service for Constrained RDAP Clients

   It is expected that a significant portion of RDAP clients will be
   written for and operate under constrained environments.  For example,
   simple Javascript clients written to run inside a web browser's
   sandbox cannot perform arbitrary DNS queries nor open sockets, thus
   limiting the ability of the client to actually access bootstrapping
   data

   TBD

3.  Security Considerations

   HTTP 30x-based redirection could offer an attack vector for a Man-in-
   the-Middle type of attack, where the adversary modifies the
   redirection URL offered by the server to the client.

   For example, an attacker able to modify HTTP traffic could modify the
   redirect URL from http://www.labs.lacnic.net/restwhois/rwhois_redir/
   ip/23.1.1.1 and change it into http://www.labs.somenic.net/restwhois/
   rwhois_redir/ip/23.1.1.1, where bogus information can be offered to
   the client.

Internet-Draft          RDAP Redirection Service               July 2014


   This particular type of attack can be prevented by usint HTTPS for
   the RDAP connection.  However, this certainly places a load burden
   upon the servers.

   While security practices are outside the scope of this document, the
   authors believe it is important to identify such problematic use
   cases to any DNR or RIR that may implement the redirection WHOIS
   service.

3.1.  Loops in Redirection

   When redirection is used there is always the risk that bogus user-
   agents and applications or malicious user can create loops that in
   turn may become Denial of Service attacks.

   Commonly used user agents (including HTTP libraries) have loop
   detection features that are deemed sufficient for breaking loops in
   RDAP.
