            draft-bormann-dispatch-modern-network-unicode-01

Abstract

   RFC 5198 both defines common conventions for the use of Unicode in
   network protocols and caters for the specific requirements of the
   legacy protocol Telnet.  In applications that do not need Telnet
   compatibility, some of the decisions of RFC 5198 are cumbersome.

   The present specification defines "Modern Network Unicode" (MNU),
   which is a form of RFC 5198 network unicode that can be used in
   specifications that require the exchange of plain text over networks
   and where just mandating UTF-8 (RFC 3629) may not be sufficient, but
   there is also no desire to import all of the baggage of RFC 5198.

   In addition to a basic "Clean Modern Network Unicode" (CMNU), this
   specification defines a number of variances that can be used to
   tailor MNU to specific areas of application.

1.  Introduction

   (Insert embellished copy of abstract here.)

   Complex specifications that use Unicode often come with detailed
   information on their Unicode usage; this level of detail generally is
   necessary to support some legacy applications.  New, simple protocol
   specifications generally do not have such a legacy or need such
   details, but can instead simply use common practice, informed by
   decades of using Unicode.  The present specification attempts to
   serve as a convenient reference for such protocol specifications,
   reducing their need for discussing Unicode to just pointing to the
   present specification and making a few simple choices.

   There is no intention that henceforth all new protocols "must" use
   the present specification.  It is offered as a standards-track

   specification simply so it can be normatively referenced from other
   standards-track specifications.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Characters in this specification are named with their Unicode name
   notated in the usual form U+NNNN or with their ASCII names (such as
   CR, LF, HT, RS, NUL) [RFC0020].

2.  Clean Modern Network Unicode

   Clean Modern Network Unicode (CMNU) is the form of Modern Network
   Unicode that does not make use of any of the variances defined below.
   It requires conformance to [RFC3629] and [RFC5198], with the
   following changes:

   o  Control characters (U+0000 to U+001F and U+007F to U+009F) MUST
      NOT be used.  Note that this also excludes line endings, so a CMNU
      string cannot extend beyond a single line.  (See also Section 3.1
      below.)

   o  The characters U+2028 and U+2029 MUST NOT be used.  (In case
      future Unicode versions add to the Unicode character categories Zl
      or Zp, any characters in these categories MUST NOT be used.)

   o  Mandates of [RFC5198] that are specific to a version of Unicode
      are relaxed, e.g., there is no check for unassigned code points.
      Note that this means that a CMNU implementation may not be able to
      handle the normalization of a character not yet assigned in the
      version of Unicode that it uses.  (See also Section 3.6 below.)

3.  Variances

   In addition to CMNU, this specification describes a number of
   variances that can be used in the form "Modern Network Unicode with
   VVV", or "Modern Network Unicode with VVV, WWW, and ZZZ" for multiple
   variances used.  Specifications that cannot directly use CMNU may be
   able to use MNU with one or more of these variances added.

3.1.  With lines

   While Clean Modern Network Unicode rules out line endings completely,
   line-structured text is often required.  The variance "with lines"
   allows the use of line endings, represented by a single LF character
   (which is then the only control character allowed).

3.2.  With CR-tolerant lines

   The variance "with CR-tolerant lines" allows the sequence CR LF as
   well as a single LF character as a line ending.  This may enable
   existing texts to be used as MNU without processing at the sender
   side (substituting that by processing at the receiver side).  Note
   that, with this variance, a CR character cannot be used anywhere else
   but immediately preceding an LF character.

3.3.  With HT Characters

   In some cases, the use of HT characters ("TABs") cannot be completely
   excluded.  The variance "with HT characters" allows their use,
   without attempting to define their meaning (e.g., equivalence with
   spaces, column definitions, etc.).

3.4.  With CCC Characters

   Some applications of MNU may need to add specific control characters,
   such as RS [RFC7464] or FF characters.  This variance is spelled with
   the ASCII name of the control character for CCC, e.g., "with RS
   characters".

3.5.  With NFKC

   Some applications require a stronger form of normalization than NFC.
   The variance "with NFKC" swaps out NFC and uses NFKC instead.  This
   is probably best used in conjunction with "with Unicode version NNN".

3.6.  With Unicode Version NNN

   Some applications need to be sure that a certain Unicode version is
   used.  The variance "with Unicode version NNN" (where nnn is a
   Unicode version number) defines the Unicode version in use as NNN.
   Also, it requires that only characters assigned in that Unicode
   version are being used.

4.  Discussion

   At the time of writing, RFCs are formatted in "Modern Network Unicode
   with CR-tolerant lines and FF characters".

   The handling of line endings (not being part of CMNU, providing LF-
   only and LF/CRLF line endings as variances) may be controversial.  In
   particular, calling out CR-tolerance as an extra (and often
   undesirable) feature may seem novel to some readers.  The handling as
   specified here is much closer to the way line endings are handled on
   the software side than the cumbersome rules of [RFC5198].  More
   generally speaking, one could say that the present specification is
   intended to be used by state of the art protocols going forward,
   maybe less so by existing protocols that have legacy baggage.

   Even in the "with CR-tolerant lines" variance, the CR character is
   only allowed as an embellishment of an immediately following LF
   character.  This reflects the fact that overprinting has only seen
   niche usage for quite a number of decades now.

   Unicode Line and Paragraph separators probably seemed like a good
   idea at the time, but have not taken hold.  Today, their occurrence
   is more likely to trigger a bug or even serve as an attack.

   HT characters ("TABs") were needed on ASR33 terminals to speed up
   whitespace processing at 110 bit/s line speed.  Unless some legacy
   applications require compatibility with this ancient and frequently
   varied convention, HT characters are no longer appropriate in Modern
   Network Unicode.  In support of legacy compatibility cases that do
   require tolerating their use, the "with HT characters" variance is
   defined.

   The version-nonspecific nature of CMNU creates some fuzziness that
   may be undesirable but is more realistic in environments where
   applications choose the Unicode version with the Unicode library that
   happens to be available to them.

5.  Using ABNF with Unicode

   Internet STD 68, [RFC5234], defines Augmented BNF for Syntax
   Specifications: ABNF.  Since the late 1970s, ABNF has often been used
   to formally describe the pieces of text that are meant to be used in
   an Internet protocol.  ABNF was developed at a time when character
   coding grew more and more complicated, and even in its current form,
   discusses encoding of characters only briefly (Section 2.4 of
   [RFC5234]).  This discussion offers no information about how this
   should be used today (it actually still refers to 16-bit Unicode!).

Internet-Draft           Modern Network Unicode                July 2019


   The best current practice of using ABNF for Unicode-based protocols
   is as follows: ABNF is used as a grammar for describing sequences of
   Unicode code points, valued from 0x0 to 0x10FFFF.  The actual
   encoding (as UTF-8) is never seen on the ABNF level; see Section 9.4
   of [RFC6020] for a recent example of this.  Approaches such as
   representing the rules of UTF-8 encoding in ABNF (see Section 3.5 of
   [RFC5255] as an example) add complexity without benefit and are NOT
   RECOMMENDED.

   ABNF features such as case-insensitivity in literal text strings
   essentially do not work for general Unicode; text string literals
   therefore (and by the definition in Section 2.3 of [RFC5234]) are
   limited to ASCII characters.  That is often not actually a problem in
   text-based protocol definitions.  Still, characters beyond ASCII need
   to be allowed in many productions.  ABNF does not have access to
   Unicode character categories and thus will be limited in its
   expressiveness here.  The core rules defines in Appendix B of
   [RFC5234] are limited to ASCII as well; new rules will therefore need
   to be defined in any protocol employing modern Unicode.

   The present specification recommends defining the following rules:

   ; modern unicode character:
   uchar =  %x20-7E / %xA0-D7FF / %xE000-FFFD / %x10000-10FFFD
   ; modern unicode newline:
   unl = %x0A
   ; alternatively, modern unicode CR-tolerant newline:
   utnl = [%x0D] %x0A
   ; if really needed, HT-tolerant unicode character:
   utchar = %x09 / uchar

6.  IANA considerations

   This specification places no requirements on IANA.

7.  Security considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC5198] apply.

   A variance "with NUL characters" would create specific security
   considerations as discussed in the security considerations of
   [RFC5198] and should therefore only be used in circumstances that
   absolutely do require it.
