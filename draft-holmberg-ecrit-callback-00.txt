Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Media Feature Tag to identity a Public
              Safety Answering Point (PSAP) Callback Call
                  draft-holmberg-ecrit-callback-00.txt

Abstract

   This specification defines a new Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
   media feature tag, sip.psap.callback, that SIP entities can use to
   identity Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) callback calls, and to
   associate them with a previously made emergency call.

Internet-Draft                PSAP Callback                     May 2011


1.  Introduction

   TBD


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Applicability and Limitation

   TBD


4.  User Agent Client behavior

4.1.  General

   TBD

4.2.  Registration

   When a UAC sends a SIP REGISTER request [RFC3261], and it wants to be
   able to receive explicit PSAP callback calls associated with that
   registration, it MUST insert a sip.psap.callback media feature tag in
   the Contact header field [RFC3261] of the request.

   The value of the sip.psap.callback MUST uniqually identity the User
   Agent (UA).  If the UA supports the "sip.instance" media feature tag
   [RFC5626], it is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that it uses the same value for
   the sip.psap.callback feature tag.

   OPEN ISSUE: Need to discuss whether the usage of a "static" value
   (e.g. the sip.instance value), that might also be known by other
   users, causes some security issues, and whether another value (that
   might change between emergency registrations, should be used instead.

   If the UAC applies the SIP Outbound mechanism [RFC5626], and
   establishes multiple registration flows associated with a
   registration, it MUST include the sip.psap.callback media feature tag
   in each REGISTER requests associated with every registration flow for
   which it wants to be able to receive explicit PSAP callback calls.
   The UAC MUST use the same media feature tag value for each
   registration flow associated with a registration.

   Unless the UAC wants the registrar to remove the media feature tag
   associated with a registration/registration flow, the UAC MUST
   include the sip.psap.callback media feature tag in every SIP REGISTER
   request associated with the registration (or registration flow),
   apart from when it terminates a registration (or registration flow).

4.3.  Emergency call

   When a UAC sends an initial SIP INVITE request [RFC3261] for an
   emergency call, it MUST insert a sip.psap.callback media feature tag
   in the Contact header field of the request.  The UAC MUST use the
   same media feature tag value that has been used for the registration
   associated with the emergency call.

   OPEN ISSUE: Should the UAC also include the media feature tag in
   calls that are not identified as emergency calls by the UAC, but will
   be determined as emergency calls by the network?

4.4.  PSAP callback call

   When a UAC, representing a PSAP, sends an initial SIP INVITE request
   for an PSAP callback call, it SHOULD insert a sip.psap.callback media
   feature tag in the Accept-Contact header field [RFC3841] of the
   request.  The UAC MUST use the same media feature tag value that was
   used for the emergency call associated with the callback call.

   If the PSAP callback call comes from a Public Switched Telephony
   Network (PSTN), or from another interworking network, the UAC
   representing the PSAP will normally be located in a network
   interworking gateway controller, such as a in a Media Gateway
   Controller (MGC).  If the interworking gateway controller is able to
   determine that the call is a PSAP callback call it MUST insert a
   media feature tag.  If the interworking gateway controller is not
   aware of the media feature tag value associated with the called user,
   it inserts an empty media feature tag.


5.  User Agent Server behavior

5.1.  General

   TBD


6.  Registrar behavior

6.1.  General

   TBD

6.2.  Registration

   When a registrar performs registration procedures for a user, if the
   associated SIP REGISTER request contains a sip.psap.callback media
   feature tag with a media feature tag value, the registrar MUST store
   the media feature tag value together with other registration data
   associated with the registering user.

   OPEN ISSUE: Is there a need for the registrar to inform the UAC that
   it supports, and has stored the value of, the sip.psap.callback media
   feature tag?

6.3.  PSAP callback call

   When a registrar receives an initial SIP INVITE request for a call,
   and the Accept-Contact header field of the request contains a
   sip.psap.callback media feature tag, if the media feature tag value
   matches a value registered for the called user, and if the registrar
   trusts the originator of the request, the registrar can decide that
   the call is a PSAP callback call.

   If the media feature tag of the request does not contain a media
   feature tag value (this might be the case if the requests comes from
   an MGC that has been able the identity the call as a PSAP callback
   call, but is not aware of the media feature tag value associated with
   the called user), if the registrar trusts the originator of the
   request, and a media feature tag value has been registered for the
   called user, the registrar MAY decide that the call is a PSAP
   callback call.

   OPEN ISSUE: If the registrar receives a request with an empty media
   feature tag, and decides that the call is a PSAP callback call,
   should the registrar add the registered media feature tag value to
   the media feature tag in the request?

8.  Security Considerations

   TBD


9.  IANA Considerations

9.1.  IANA Registration of the sip.psap.callback media feature tag

   This section registers a new media feature tag, sip.psap.callback,
   into the into the SIP media feature tag tree.  The required
   information for this registration, as specified in section 3.4 of
   [RFC2506], is:

    RFC Number: RFC XXXX [[NOTE TO IANA: Please replace XXXX with the
        RFC number of this specification]]

    Media feature tag name: sip.psap.callback

    ASN.1 identifier associated with feature tag: New assignment by IANA

        Summary of the media feature indicated by this feature tag: This feature tag indicates
           a unique value for a User Agent (UA), which is used to associate PSAP callback calls with
           emergency calls placed by the user.

        Values appropriate for use with this feature tag: String (equality relationship)

        Examples of typical use: Associating a PSAP callback call with a previously placed
          emergency call.

        Related standards or documents: RFC 3840

        Security Considerations: General security considerations for media
          feature tags are discussed in Section 11.1 of RFC 3840.


10.  Acknowledgements

   The original idea of using a token based mechanism to associate PSAP
   callback calls with emergency calls was presented by Cullen Jennings.

   comments and feedbacks on the initial draft.
