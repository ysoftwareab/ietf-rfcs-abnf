nameddest=<name>
      Open to a specified named destination (which includes a view).
page=<pagenum>
      Open the specified (physical) page.
zoom=<scale>,<left>,<top>
      Set the <scale> and scrolling factors.  <left> and <top> are
      measured from the top left corner of the page independent of the
      size of the page. The pair <left> and <top> are optional but
      both must appear if present.
view=<keyword>,<position>
      Set the view to show some specified portion of the page or its
      bounding box; keywords are defined by Table 8.2 of the PDF
      Reference, version 1.5.  The <position> value is required for
      some of the keywords and not allowed for others.
viewrect=<left>,<top>,<wd>,<ht>
      As with the zoom parameter, set the scale and scrolling factors,
      but using an explicit width and height instead of a scale
      percentage.
highlight=<lt>,<rt>,<top>,<btm>
      Highlight a rectangle on the chosen page where <lt>, <rt>, <top>
      and <btm> are the coordinates of the sides of the rectangle
      measured from the top left corner of the page.
