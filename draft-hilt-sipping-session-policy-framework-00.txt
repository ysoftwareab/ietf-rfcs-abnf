Abstract

   Proxy servers play a central role as an intermediary in the Session
   Initiation Protocol (SIP) as they define and impact policies on call
   routing, rendezvous, and other call features.  However, there is
   currently no standard mechanism by which a proxy can influence
   session policies, such as the codecs or media types to be used.  This

Internet-Draft          Session Policy Framework            October 2005


1.  Introduction

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [6] is a signaling protocol for
   creating, modifying and terminating multimedia sessions.  A central
   element in SIP is the proxy server.  Proxy servers are intermediaries
   that are responsible for request routing, rendezvous, authentication
   and authorization, mobility, and other signaling services.  However,
   proxies are divorced from the actual sessions - audio, video, and
   messaging - that SIP establishes.  Details of the sessions are
   carried in the payload of SIP messages, and are usually described
   with the Session Description Protocol (SDP) [7].  Indeed, SIP
   provides end-to-end encryption features using S/MIME, so that all
   information about the sessions can be hidden from eavesdroppers and
   proxies alike.

   However, experience has shown that there is a need for SIP
   intermediaries to impact aspects of a session.  For example, SIP may
   be used in a wireless network, which has limited resources for media
   traffic.  During periods of high activity, the wireless network
   provider wants to restrict the amount of bandwidth available to each
   individual user.  With session policies, an intermediary in the
   wireless network can inform the user agent about the bandwidth it
   currently has available.  This information enables the user agent to
   make an informed decision about the number of streams, the media
   types, and the codecs it can successfully use in a session.

   In another example, a SIP user agent is using a network which is
   connected to the public Internet through a firewall or a network
   border device.  The network provider would like to tell the user
   agent that it needs to send its media streams to a specific IP
   address and port on the firewall or border device to reach the public
   Internet.  Knowing this policy enables the user agent to set up
   sessions across the firewall or the network border.  In contrast to
   other methods for inserting a media intermediary, the use of session
   policies does not require the inspection or modification of SIP
   message bodies.  Other user cases for session policies are described
   in [8].

   Domains sometimes enforce policies they have in place.  For example,
   a domain might have a configuration in which all packets containing a
   certain audio codec are dropped.  Unfortunately, enforcement
   mechanisms usually do not inform the user about the policies they are
   enforcing and silently keep the user from doing anything against
   them.  This may lead to the malfunctioning of devices that is
   incomprehensible to the user.  With session policies, the user knows
   about the restricted codecs and can use a different codec or simply
   connect to a domain with less stringent policies.  Session policies
   provide an important combination of consent coupled with enforcement.

Internet-Draft          Session Policy Framework            October 2005


   That is, the user becomes aware of the policy and needs to act on it,
   but the provider still retains the right to enforce the policy.

   Two types of session policies exist: session-specific policies and
   session-independent policies.  Session-specific policies are policies
   that are created for one particular session, in response to (certain
   aspects of) the session description for this session (e.g. the IP
   addresses and ports that are used for media).  Since session-specific
   policies are tailored to a session, they only apply to the session
   they are created for.  They are created on a session-by-session basis
   during the establishment of the session at the time the session
   description is known.

   Session-independent policies on the other hand are policies that are
   created independent of a session and generally apply to the SIP
   sessions set up by a user agent.  Since these policies are not based
   on a specific session description, they can be created and conveyed
   to the user agent at any time, independent of an attempt to set up a
   session.

   This specification defines a framework for SIP session policies.  It
   specifies a model, the overall architecture, and the protocol
   components that are needed for session-independent and session-
   specific policies.


2.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
   RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as
   described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [1] and indicate requirement levels for
   compliant implementations.


3.  Session-Independent Policies

   This section defines a model and the protocol components for session-
   independent policies.

3.1.  Model

   Setting up session-independent policies involves the following steps:

   1.  A user agent requests session-independent policies from the
       policy servers in the local network and home domain.  These two
       domains most likely have session-independent policies for a user
       agent.  A user agent typically request these policies when it

Internet-Draft          Session Policy Framework            October 2005


       starts up or connects to a new network domain.
   2.  The policy server selects the policies that apply to this user
       agent.  The policy server may have general policies that apply to
       all users or maintain separate policies for each individual user.
       The selected policies are returned to the user agent.
   3.  The policy server may update the policies, for example, when
       network conditions change.
   4.  The user agent considers the policies received when creating or
       managing session descriptions for SIP sessions.

3.2.  Protocol

   A UA subscribes to session-independent policies using the "ua
   profile" event package defined in the Framework for SIP User Agent
   Profile Delivery [4].  This event package has been designed to
   support subscriptions to user agent configuration information as well
   as to session-specific policies.  A server can provide session-
   independent policies and configuration information through the same
   subscription.  However, it is expected that session-independent
   policies and configuration information will often be provided by
   different servers, which may even be in different domains.  In
   addition, session-independent policies may change more frequently
   than configuration information since they may consider external
   information, such as the network status or simply the time of day.

3.2.1.  Subscription

   Session-independent policies are usually provided by the network
   domain the UA is physically connected to (i.e. the local network
   domain).  This domain may, for example, have policies needed to
   support the network infrastructure (e.g. by limiting the bandwidth
   available to a user).  Frequently, the domain a user registers at
   (i.e., the domain in the address-of-record (AoR)) will also provides
   session-independent policies.  This domain may, for example, provide
   policies needed for services the user has subscribed to.

   The "ua profile" event package [4] provides a mechanism to discover
   policy servers in these two domains.  The "localnetwork" profile-type
   enables a UA to discover a servers in the local network domain; the
   "user" profile type enables the discovery of a server in the AoR
   domain.  A UA SHOULD attempt to discover and subscribe to the policy
   servers in these two domains.

   A UA SHOULD create a SUBSCRIBE request in the following events:

   o  The UA registers a AoR for the first time or removes a AoR from
      the set of AoRs it has registered.  In these cases, the UA SHOULD
      establish subscriptions for each new AoR using the "user" and the

Internet-Draft          Session Policy Framework            October 2005


      "localnetwork" profile-types.  It SHOULD terminate all
      subscriptions for the AoRs that have been removed.
   o  The UA changes the domain it is connected to.  The UA SHOULD
      create a new subscription for each AoR using the "localnetwork"
      profile-type.  It SHOULD terminate all existing subscriptions for
      the "localnetwork" profile-type.  It does not need to change the
      subscriptions for "user" profiles.

   If a subscriber is unable to establish a subscription, it SHOULD NOT
   attempt to re-try this subscription, unless one of the above events
   occurs again.  This is to limit the number of SUBSCRIBE requests sent
   within domains that do not support session-independent policies.

3.2.2.  Content

   The "ua profile" event package is an abstract event package that does
   not define a default content type for subscriptions.  A user agent
   subscribing to session-independent policies SHOULD include the MIME
   type for the Schema for SIP User Agent Profile Data Sets [9] and the
   "application/session-policy+xml" format [3] in the Accept header of a
   SUBSCRIBE request.  The Schema for SIP User Agent Profile Data Sets
   is an abstract format for configuration data that is extended by the
   "application/session-policy+xml" format for media-related policies.
   These are the default formats for subscriptions to session-
   independent policies and MUST be supported by a user agent compliant
   to this specification.

      OPEN ISSUE: Do we need a separate MIME type for the policy format
      or is it sufficient to use the MIME type of the UA data set
      schema?  It is unclear how the user agent indicates that it
      supports the session policy format and that it wants to receive
      session policies.

   A policy server MAY send a notification to the subscriber every time
   the session-independent policy covered by the subscription changes.
   The definition of what causes a policy to change is at the discretion
   of the administrator.  A change in the policy may be triggered, for
   example, by a change in the network status or simply by an update of
   the service level agreement with the customer.  The session-
   independent policy contained in notification MUST represent a
   complete session-independent policy.  Deltas to previous policies or
   partial policies are not supported.


4.  Session-Specific Policies

   This section defines a model, an architecture and the protocol
   components for session-specific policies.

   Figure 1

   The following entities are involved in setting up session-specific
   policies (see Figure 1): a user agent (UA), a proxy, a policy server
   and possibly a router with policy enforcement functionality.

   The role of the proxy is to provide a rendezvous mechanism for UA and
   policy server.  It conveys the URI of the policy server in its domain
   to UAs and ensures that UAs know where to retrieve policies from.  It
   does not deliver the actual policies to UAs.

   The policy server is a separate logical entity that may be physically
   co-located with the proxy.  Each domain has at most one policy
   server.  The role of the policy server is to generate session
   policies for a session.  It receives session information from a UA,
   generates a policy and returns that policy back to the UA.  The way
   policies are generated is outside the scope of this specification.  A
   policy server could, for example, use local rules, query external
   sources for additional information or retrieve policies from a
   separate policy infrastructure.

   A UA receives the URI of a policy server from the proxy.  It uses
   this URI to establish a policy channel to the policy server.  It
   provides information about the current session to the policy server
   and receives session policies in response.  The UA may also receive
   policy updates from the policy server during the course of a session.

   A network may have a policy enforcement infrastructure in place.
   However, this specification does not make any assumptions about the

Internet-Draft          Session Policy Framework            October 2005


   enforcement of session policies and the mechanisms defined here are
   orthogonal a policy enforcement infrastructure.  Their goal is to
   provide a means for the UA to convey session information to a policy
   server and to receive the policies that apply to this session in
   response.

4.2.  Model

   The protocol defined in this specification follows a separate channel
   model.  SIP signaling is only used to rendezvous the UA with the
   policy server.  From this point on, UA and policy server communicate
   directly with each other over a separate policy channel.  This is
   opposed to a piggyback model, where the exchange of session and
   policy information between the user agent and the policy server is
   piggybacked onto SIP signaling messages exchanged between the two
   user agents.

   A disadvantage of the separate channel model is that it requires
   additional messages for the exchange of policy information.  The
   advantages of using a separate policy channel is that it decouples
   the exchange of signaling messages between endpoints from the
   exchange of policy information between endpoint and policy server.
   This decoupling enables the use of encryption on the signaling path
   (to secure the communication between endpoints) and on the policy
   channel (to secure the communication between endpoint and policy
   server).  Existing schemes for authorization, authentication, signing
   and encryption can be used on the policy channel.  This is not
   possible if policies are piggybacked onto the signaling messages.
   Another advantage of the separate channel model is that policies do
   not travel along the signaling path possibly crossing may domains.
   If policy server and UA are in the same network, policy information
   never leaves this network.  In addition, endpoints can specifically
   decide which aspects of a session they want to disclose to a certain
   policy server.  Finally, a policy server does not rely on a SIP
   signaling message flowing by to provide a session policy to an
   endpoint.  A policy server can use the separate channel at any time
   to update session policies as needed.

   The communication on the policy channel between a UA and a policy
   server involves the following steps:

   1.  A user agent submits a session description to the policy server
       and asks whether a session using this session description is
       permissible.
   2.  The policy server creates a policy decision for this particular
       session and returns the decision to the user agent.  Possible
       policy decisions are to (1) deny the session, (2) propose changes
       to the session description with which the session is acceptable,

Internet-Draft          Session Policy Framework            October 2005


       or (3) accept the session as it was proposed.
   3.  The policy server may update the policy decision at any time.
   4.  The user agent applies the policy decision to the session it is
       establishing or managing.

4.3.  Overview of Operation

   This section provides example call flows to illustrate the
   establishment of session-specific policies.

   In the following scenario, there are two domains (domain A and domain
   B), which both have session-specific policies for the UAs in their
   domain.  Both domains do not provide policies to the UAs outside of
   their domain.  The two domains have a proxy (P A and P B) and a
   policy server (PS A and PS B).  The policies in both domains involve
   the session description offer and answer.

4.3.1.  Offer in Request

   The first call flow depicts an INVITE transaction with the offer in
   the request.  It is assumed that the UAC does not have previous
   knowledge about the policy server in its domain.

   (1) UA A sends an INVITE to proxy P A. P A knows that policies apply
   to this session and (2) returns a 488 to UA A. P A includes the URI
   of PS A in the 488 response. (3) UA A contacts PS A, discloses the
   session description offer to PS A and (4) receives policies for the
   offer. (5) UA A reformulates the INVITE request under consideration
   of the received policies and includes a Policy-Id header to indicate
   that it has already contacted PS A. P A does not reject the INVITE
   this time and removes the Policy-Id header when forwarding the
   INVITE.  P B adds a Policy-Contact header containing the URI of PS B.
   (6) UA B uses this URI to contact PS B and discloses the offer and
   the answer it is about to send. (7) UA B receives policies from PS B
   and applies them to the offer and answer respectively. (8) UA B
   returns the updated answer in the 200 OK. (9) UA A contacts PS A with
   the answer and (10) retrieves answer policies from PS A.

4.3.2.  Offer in Response

   This call flow depicts an INVITE transaction with the offer in the
   response.

   Steps (1) - (8) are analogous to steps (1) - (8) in the above flow.
   An important difference is that in steps (9) and (10) UA A contacts
   PS A after receiving the offer in the 200 OK but before returning the
   answer in step (11).  This enables UA A to return the final answer,
   which includes all applicable policies, in the ACK.  However, it
   requires that PS A immediately returns a policy to avoid a delay in
   the transmission of the ACK.  This is similar to Flow I in [10].

4.4.  UA/Policy Server Rendezvous

   The first step in setting up session-specific policies is to
   rendezvous the UAs with the relevant policy servers.  This is
   achieved by providing the URIs of all policy servers relevant for a
   session to the UAs.

4.4.1.  UAC Behavior

   When a UA compliant to this specification generates an INVITE or
   UPDATE request, it MUST include a Supported header field with the
   option tag "policy" in the request.

   A UAC may receive a 488 in response to an INVITE or UPDATE request,
   which contains a Policy-Contact header field.  This is a new header
   defined in this specification that contains the URI of a policy
   server.  A 488 response with this header is generated by a proxy to
   convey the URI of the local policy server to the UAC.  The UAC SHOULD
   use this URI to contact the policy server and ask for policies for
   current session.  The UAC SHOULD apply the policies received and
   resend the updated request.

   The UAC MUST a Policy-Id header into the updated request.  The

Internet-Draft          Session Policy Framework            October 2005


   Policy-Id header MUST include the URIs of all policy servers the UAC
   has contacted during the processing of the request.  The Policy-Id
   header enables a proxy to determine whether the URI of its policy
   server is already known to the UAC (and thus the request can be
   passed through) or whether the URI still needs to be conveyed to the
   UAC in a 488 response.

   In some cases, a request may traverse multiple domains with session-
   policies in place.  Each of these domains may return a 488 response
   containing a policy server URI.  Since the UAC contacts the policy
   server URI received in a 488 response before it resends the request,
   session policies are always applied to a session in the order in
   which the request traverses through these domains.  The UAC SHOULD
   NOT change this implicit order among policy servers.

   Session policies may apply to the offer, the answer or both session
   descriptions.  Depending on the type of session policies, a UAC may
   need to submit the offer and/or the answer to the policy server.  If
   offer and answer are submitted separately, they MUST be submitted to
   the same policy servers.  If the UAC receives an answer in the
   response to an INVITE request (i.e. the request contained the offer),
   it MUST send the ACK before retrieving the policies for the answer
   from the policy server.  If the UAC receives a response with an offer
   (i.e. the INVITE request did not contain an offer), the UAC MUST
   first contact the policy server to retrieve session policies and
   apply these policies before sending the answer in the ACK.  The
   answer in the ACK will therefore already consider the relevant
   policies.

      This approach assumes that the policy server immediately responds
      to a policy request and does not require manual intervention to
      create a policy.  A delay in the response from the policy server
      would delay the transmission of the ACK and could trigger
      retransmissions of the INVITE response (also see the
      recommendations for Flow I in [10]).

4.4.2.  Caching of Policy Server URIs

   A UAC SHOULD cache the URI of the local policy server.  It receives
   this URI in a 488 from the proxy in the local domain.  The UAC SHOULD
   use this URI to retrieve session policies for a new INVITE or UPDATE
   request before it is sent.  Caching the local policy server URI
   avoids the retransmission of this URI for each new INVITE or UPDATE
   request.  Domains can prevent the UAC from caching the local policy
   server URI.  This is useful, for example, if the policy server does
   not need to be involved in all sessions or the policy server URI
   changes from session to session.  A proxy can mark the URI of such a
   policy server as "non-cacheable".  The UA SHOULD NOT cache a non-

Internet-Draft          Session Policy Framework            October 2005


   cacheable policy server URI.  It SHOULD remove the current URI from
   the cache when receiving a "non-cacheable" URI.

   The UAC SHOULD NOT cache policy server URIs it has received from
   proxies outside of the local domain.  These policy servers may not be
   relevant for subsequent sessions, which may go to a different
   destination and may traverse different domains.

   The UAC SHOULD store the list of policy server URIs is has contacted
   for a session.  The UAC should keep this list until the session is
   terminated.  The UAC SHOULD contact the policy server URIs in this
   list for each mid-dialog INVITE or UPDATE request.  This avoids the
   retransmission of policy server URIs for each mid-dialog requests.

4.4.3.  UAS Behavior

   An incoming INVITE or UPDATE request may contain a Policy-Contact
   header with a list of policy server URIs.  The UAS SHOULD use these
   URIs to ask for session policies.  The UAS MUST use the policy server
   URIs in the order in which they were contained in the Policy-Contact
   header, starting with the topmost value.

   If the UAS receives an ACK with an answer, it may need to contact the
   policy servers again depending on the policy type.  In this case, it
   MUST contact the same policy servers it has contacted for the offer.

4.4.4.  Proxy Behavior

   A proxy may provide the URI of the local policy server to the UAC or
   the UAS when processing an INVITE or UPDATE request.

   If an INVITE or UPDATE request contains a Supported header field with
   the option tag "policy", the proxy MAY reject the request with a 488
   response to provide the local policy server URI to the UAC.  Before
   rejecting a request, the proxy MUST check whether the request has a
   Policy-Id header field that already contains this policy server URI.
   If the request does not have such a header or the local policy server
   URI is not present in that header, then the proxy MAY reject the
   request with a 488.  The proxy MUST insert a Policy-Contact header in
   the 488 response that contains the URI of the local policy server.
   The proxy MAY add the header field parameter "non-cacheable" to
   prevent the UAC from caching this policy server URI.

   If the local policy server URI is already present in the Policy-Id
   header of an INVITE or UPDATE request, the proxy MUST NOT reject the
   request as described above.  The proxy SHOULD remove this policy
   server URI from the Policy-Id header field before forwarding the
   request.

Internet-Draft          Session Policy Framework            October 2005


   The proxy MAY insert a Policy-Contact header field into an INVITE or
   UPDATE request in order to convey the policy server URI to the UAS.
   If the request already contains a Policy-Contact header field, the
   proxy MUST insert the URI before all existing values at the beginning
   of the list.  A proxy MUST NOT change the order of existing Policy-
   Contact header values.

4.4.5.  Header Definition and Syntax

   The Policy-Id header field is inserted into an INVITE or UPDATE
   request by the UAC.  It identifies all policy servers the UAC has
   contacted for the request.  A Policy-Id header value is the URI of a
   policy server.

   The syntax of the Policy-Id header field is:

     Policy-Id        = "Policy-Id" HCOLON absoluteURI
                        *(COMMA absoluteURI)

   The Policy-Contact header field can be inserted into INVITE and
   UPDATE requests by a proxy.  It contains an ordered list of policy
   server URIs that need to be contacted by the UAS.  The UAS starts to
   process the header field at the topmost value of this list.  New
   header field values are inserted at the top.  The Policy-Contact
   header field effectively forms a stack.  The "non-cacheable" header
   field parameter MUST NOT be used in a request.

   The Policy-Contact header field can also be inserted into a 488
   response to an INVITE or UPDATE request by a proxy.  It contains a
   policy server URI that needs to be contacted by the UAC.  A proxy MAY
   add the "non-cacheable" header field parameter to indicate that the
   UAC should not cache the policy server URI.

   The syntax of the Policy-Contact header field is:

     Policy-Contact   = "Policy-Contact" HCOLON policyURI
                        *(COMMA policyURI)
     policyURI        = absoluteURI [ SEMI "non-cacheable" ]

   The BNF for absoluteURI is defined in [6].

   Table 1 is an extension of Tables 2 and 3 in [6].  The column 'UPD'
   is for the UPDATE method [5].

4.5.  Policy Channel Protocol

   The policy channel is implemented by the "session-spec-policy" event
   package defined in [2].  When a UA needs to contact a policy server
   it creates (or refreshes) a subscription to the policy server using
   the above event package.  All implementations MUST support this event
   package as a policy channel implementation.

   A UA may receive policy updates through the policy channel.  The UA
   SHOULD apply these policies to the current session.  It may need to
   generate a re-INVITE or UPDATE request to communicate the changes in
   the session to the peer UA.
