Abstract

   Trust Anchor Locators (TALs) [RFC7730] are used by Relying Parties in
   the RPKI to locate and validate Trust Anchor certificates used in
   RPKI validation.  This documents defines an RPKI signed object
   [RFC6488] for a Trust Anchor Locator (TAL) that can be published by
   Trust Anchor to communicate a new TAL to already deployed Relying
   Parties.  The two primary use cases for this are that 1) a Trust
   Anchor may wish to change the locations where its TA certificate may
   be found, and 2) a Trust Anchor may wish to perform a planned
   migration to a new key.  Note that unplanned key rolls are considered
   out of scope for this document.

1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Introduction

   Trust Anchor Locator (TAL) files [RFC7730] are used in the Resource
   Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) to help Relying Parties locate and
   verify a trust anchor certificate.  A TAL file consists of:

   o  One or more rsync URIs [RFC5781]



Bruijnzeels & Martinez  Expires December 30, 2017               [Page 2]

Internet-Draft         RPKI signed object for TAL              June 2017


   o  A subjectPublicKeyInfo [RFC5280] in DER format [X.509], encoded in
      Base64

   The TAL can be distributed out-of-band to Relying Parties (RP), and
   it allows the RP to retrieve the most recent version of the Trust
   Anchor (TA) certificate from the cited location, and verify that
   public key of this certificate matches the TAL.  This is useful as it
   allows selected data in the trust anchor to change, without needing
   to effect redistribution of the trust anchor per se.  In particular
   the Internet Number Resources (INRs) extension [RFC3779] and the
   publication points defined in the Subject Information Access
   [RFC6487] may be updated this way.

   The assumption is that both the URIs and key of the TA certificate
   remain stable.  However, an organisation operating a TA may wish to
   change either of these properties, because of a need to:

   o  change one or more URIs

   o  perform a planned key roll

   In this document we describe a method for TA operators to publish a
   an updated TAL in a secure a well-defined fashion, so that RPs can be
   alerted to these changes.

3.  Signed TAL definition

   A signed TAL is an RPKI signed object, as specified in [RFC6488].
   The RPKI signed object template requires specification of the
   following data elements in the context of the manifest structure.

3.1.  The Signed TAL Content Type

   This document requests an OID for signed-Tal as follows:

   signed-Tal OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) member-body(2) us(840)
              rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs9(9) 16 id-smime (1) TBD }

   This OID MUST appear both within the eContentType in the
   encapContentInfo object as well as the content-type signed attribute
   in the signerInfo object (see [RFC6488]).

3.2.  The Signed TAL eContent

   The content of a Signed TAL is ASN.1 encoded using the Distinguished
   Encoding Rules (DER) [X.690], and is defined as follows:

   SignedTalContent ::= IA5String

Internet-Draft         RPKI signed object for TAL              June 2017


   The "SignedTalContent" contains the content of the new TAL encoded in
   Base64 [RFC4648].

3.3.  Signed TAL Validation

   Before a Relying Party can use a Signed TAL, the relying party MUST
   first validate the Signed TAL.  To validate a Signed TAL, the relying
   party MUST perform all the validation checks specified in [RFC6488]
   as well as the following additional specific validation step.

   o  The eContentType in the EncapsulatedContentInfo has OID
      1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.1.TBD.

   o  The EE certificate of this Signed TAL is signed by a known Trust
      Anchor

   o  The decoded TAL content conforms to the format defined in
      [RFC7730]

   If the above procedure indicates that the manifest is invalid, then
   the Signed TAL MUST be discarded and treated as though no Signed TAL
   were present.

4.  Signed TAL Generation

   A TA MAY choose to generate a single Singed TAL object to publish in
   its TA certificate publication point(s) in the RPKI.  The TA MUST
   perform the following steps to generate the Signed TAL:

   o  Generate a key pair for a "one-time-use" EE certificate to use for
      the Signed TAL

   o  Generate a one-time-use EE certificate for the Signed TAL

   o  This EE certificate MUST have an SIA extension access description
      field with an accessMethod OID value of id-ad-signedobject, where
      the associated accessLocation references the publication point of
      the Sigend TAL as an object URL.

   o  This EE certificate MUST describe its Internet Number Resources
      (INRs) using the "inherit" attribute, rather than explicit
      description of a resource set (see [RFC3779]).

   o  This EE certificate MUST have a "notBefore" time that is before
      the moment that the Signed TAL will be published.

Internet-Draft         RPKI signed object for TAL              June 2017


   o  This EE certificate MUST have a "notAfter" time that reflects the
      intended staging period, which MUST be at least 24 hours after the
      moment that the Signed TAL will be published.

5.  Signed TAL Publication

   A TA MAY publish a single Signed TAL object directly under its TA
   certificate publication point(s) in the RPKI.  The object base
   filename SHOULD use a similar strategy as the base filename that is
   used to the determine the CRL and Manifest filenames for this TA
   certificate, and the extension part of the filename MUST be ".tal".

6.  Supporting a TA Key Roll

   A Signed TAL MAY be used to communicate a planned key roll for the
   TA.

6.1.  Preparing a new TA key

   Prior to publishing the Signed TAL for the new key the TA MUST
   perform the following steps:

   o  Generate a new key pair for the new TA certificate

   o  Generate a new TA Certificate, using a Subject Information Access
      for CA certificates (see section 4.8.8.1 of [RFC6487]) that
      references the URIs that will be used by the new key to publish
      objects, that are different from the URIs used by the TA
      certificate for the current key.

   o  ALL current signed certificates and other objects, with the
      exception of the old CRL, Manifest and Signed TAL, must be re-
      issued by the new key and published under the new publication
      point(s).

   o  The new TA certificate itself MUST be published in a (number of)
      new location(s) that are different from where the TA certificate
      for the current key is published.

   After these steps are performed a new Signed TAL MUST be generated as
   described in Section 4, and published as described in Section 5.

6.2.  Staging period - Using both the old and the new TA key

   The staging period is initiated by the initial publication of a
   Signed TAL for the new key and must last at least 24 HOURS.

Internet-Draft         RPKI signed object for TAL              June 2017


   During the staging period the TA MUST continue to operate both the
   old and the new TA key.

6.3.  Preserving the Signed TAL

   The TA MAY preserve a Signed TAL for the old key after the staging
   period as a hint for RPs that missed the key roll.  The following
   process can be used to achieve this:

   o  Produce a new long-lived CRL that revokes all previously signed
      certificates

   o  Produce a new long-lived Signed TAL

   o  Produce a new long-lived manifest that includes the CRL and Signed
      TAL

   o  Publish the CRL, MFT and Signed TAL

   o  Destroy the old TA key

6.4.  Retiring the old key

   The TA MAY retire and delete its old key after the staging period is
   over.

7.  Supporting changing TA certificate publication point(s)

   A signed TAL MAY be used to communicate an addition or removal of one
   or more publication locations where the TA certificate can be found.

7.1.  Adding a publication point

   When adding a publication point for a TA certificate, the TA MUST
   publish the certificate in the new location(s) prior to publication
   of the Signed TAL.

7.2.  Withdrawing a publication point

   When removing a publication point for TA certificate, the TA SHOULD
   observe a staging period of at least 24 Hours.  The staging period is
   initiated by the publication of an updated Signed TAL where the
   publication point has been removed.  During the staging period the TA
   SHOULD keep the old publication point up to date and available.

Internet-Draft         RPKI signed object for TAL              June 2017


7.3.  Withdrawing the Signed TAL

   The TA MUST withdraw the Signed TAL after the chosen staging period,
   of at least 24 hours, is over.

8.  Relying Party Use

   When an RP discovers a new valid TAL signed under a trust anchor, it
   SHOULD substitute the current TAL immediately.

   RP software MAY start using the new TAL thus found automatically
   without operator intervention, but it is RECOMMENDED that the
   software informs the operator of this event, and keeps a back-up of
   the old TAL.

   Furthermore, it is RECOMMENDED that the RP software informs the
   operator whether the new TAL represents a key roll, or a change in
   URIs only.

9.  IANA Considerations

9.1.  OID

   IANA is to add the following to the "RPKI Signed Objects" registry:

         Decimal  Description                       References

         TBD      signed-Tal                       [section 3.1]

9.2.  File Extension

   IANA is to add an item for the Signed TAL file extension to the "RPKI
   Repository Name Scheme" created by [RFC6481] as follows:

         Extension      RPKI Object           Reference
         -------------------------------------------------------
            .tal        Signed TAL            [this document]

10.  Security Considerations

   TBD

11.  Acknowledgements

   TBD
