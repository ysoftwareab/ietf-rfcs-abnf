1. Abstract 
    
   In this document, a measurement framework for supporting the traffic 
   engineering of IP-based networks is presented.  Uses of traffic 
   measurement in service provider environments are described, and 
   issues related to time scale and read-out period are discussed.  
   Different measurement types are classified, with each being 
   specified as a meaningful combination of a measurement entity and a 
   measurement basis. 
    
   For interoperable compatibility, uniform definitions across vendors 
   and operators must be ensured, e.g., in the distinction between 
   offered load and achieved throughput.  To aid network dimensioning, 
   mechanisms to collect node-pair-based traffic data should be 
   developed to facilitate the derivation of per-service-class traffic 
   matrix statistics.  For service assurance, there is a need for the 
   use of higher-order statistics.  To preserve representative traffic 
   detail at manageable sample volumes, there is a need for packet-

   sampled measurements.  To manage large volume of measured data, use 
   of bulk transfer and filtering/aggregation mechanisms may be 
   appropriate.

Internet-Draft  Framework for Internet Traffic Measurement    Jan 2003 
 
 
   This document describes a framework for Internet traffic engineering 
   measurement, with the objective of providing principles for the 
   development of a set of measurement systems to support the traffic 
   engineering of IP-based networks [1].  A major goal is to provide 
   the scope of measurements involved and outline a context for 
   establishing operator-, platform-, protocol-, and vendor-neutral 
   traffic measurement standards.  To achieve multi-vendor inter-
   operability, it is critical to minimize the possibilities of 
   inconsistencies arising from, e.g., differing statistical 
   definitions, overlapping data collection, processing at different 
   protocol levels, and similar inconsistencies by different vendors or 
   network operators. 
    
   The need for a common framework, including identification, 
   principles and scope of measurements, is motivated by the needs for 
   consistency, precision, and effectiveness of the overall traffic 
   engineering function.  Traffic engineering includes measurements, 
   forecasting, planning, dimensioning, control, and performance 
   monitoring.  From this perspective, the purpose of this document is 
   to set principles of measurement in place that assure the quality of 
   the other aspects of traffic engineering.  Intended as a framework 
   document, our goal is to describe the overall traffic and 
   performance measurement process at a high level.  We point to 
   objectives that a comprehensive set of measurement standards should 
   achieve.  We also list brief informal definitions for most 
   measurements of interest, but leaving exhaustive and precise 
   definitions and standards to the documents cited or subsequent 
   documents to be developed by other working groups. 
    
   The scope of this document is limited to those aspects of 
   measurement pertaining to intra-domain operations, i.e., within a 
   given autonomous system.  However, measurements on its boundary with 
   other domains are included as well.  The focus is primarily on 
   traffic engineering in Internet service provider environments. 
    
   In this document, uses of traffic measurement in traffic 
   characterization, network monitoring, and traffic control are first 
   described.  Depending on the network operations to be performed in 
   these tasks, three different time scales can be identified, ranging 
   from months, through days or hours, to minutes or less.  To support 
   these operations, traffic measurement must be able to capture 
   accurately, within a given confidence interval, the traffic 
   variations and peaks without degrading network performance and 
   without generating an immense amount of data.  As one consequence of 
   the need to avoid network performance degradation, specification of 
   a suitable read-out period for each service class for traffic 
   summarization is essential.  Other principles such as concise 
   representation of measurements are identified as well. 
    
   Traffic measurement can be performed on the basis of flows, 
   interfaces, links, nodes, node-pairs, or paths.  Based on these 
   objects, different measurement entities can be defined, such as 
   traffic volume, average holding time, bandwidth availability,

   throughput, delay, delay variation, packet loss, and resource usage.  
   Using these measured traffic data, in conjunction with other network 
   data such as topological data and router configuration data, traffic 
   matrix and other relevant statistics can be derived for traffic 
   engineering purposes.  Traffic load measurement also plays a key 
   role in network performance management. 
    
   In addition to these capabilities, functions of a measurement system 
   should also include data storage, data processing, statistics 
   generation and reporting.  However, these aspects are outside the 
   scope of this document. 
    
   As a framework, this document is mainly concerned with a discussion 
   of various technical issues surrounding traffic measurement, 
   particularly in the area of statistical traffic load estimation for 
   traffic engineering purposes.  As far as possible and to avoid 
   duplication of effort, relevant work done in measurements by other 
   standards organizations will be applied or adapted, and references 
   to them will be made.  These include, in particular, 
    
   . IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) Working Group of the IETF: its 
     framework document [2] and the associated documents on individual 
     metrics [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] 
    
   . ITU-T: Recommendation I.380/Y.1540 [11] and Recommendation Y.1541 
     [12] 
    
4. Terminology 
    
   The intent of this section is not to provide definition or 
   description of terms used in this document.  Rather, it is to 
   highlight the difference in usage of closely related terms. 
    
4.1 Route, path 
    
   A route is any unidirectional sequence of nodes and links, for 
   sending packets from a source node to a destination node.  A path 
   refers to an MPLS tunnel, i.e., a label-switched path [13]. 
    
   It should be pointed out that there are also methods for creating 
   paths with other technologies such as frame relay or ATM.  The 
   measurement described in this document may apply to these 
   technologies with suitable adaptation.  To simplify description, 
   reference is made to MPLS only in what follows. 
    
4.2 Throughput, traffic volume 
    
   Both quantities can be applied to a network, a network segment, or 
   an individual network element. 
    
   Throughput of a network, as a measure of delivered performance, 
   refers to the maximum sustainable rate of transferring packets 
   successfully across the network, under given network conditions, 
  
Lai, et al              Category - Expiration                [Page 4] 
Internet-Draft  Framework for Internet Traffic Measurement    Jan 2003 
 
 
   e.g., a given traffic mix, while meeting quality of service (QoS) 
   objectives.  This usage is consistent with the definition of 
   throughput for a network interconnect device as specified in [14].  
   For real-time network control, active measurement of throughput by 
   probing may be used to determine the currently available capacity of 
   a network to carry additional traffic.  (In an active measurement, 
   test packets are injected into the network.  Data collected about 
   these packets are taken as representative of the behavior of the 
   network.) 
    
   Traffic volume, as a measure of the traffic carried, characterizes 
   the level of traffic that a network is designed to support.  
   Passive, i.e., in-service non-intrusive, measurement of the traffic 
   volume is usually used to estimate the long-term offered traffic for 
   the purposes of network dimensioning in the capacity-management and 
   network-planning processes (see the Section on Time Scales for 
   Network Operations).  A network should be properly dimensioned so 
   that its throughput is adequate to handle the expected traffic 
   volume. 
    
   Throughput at a cross-section, or specific point in the network, is 
   expressed in terms of number of data units per time unit.  Traffic 
   volume is expressed in data units with reference to a read-out 
   period (see the Section on Read-Out Periods).  For transmission 
   systems, the data unit is usually a multiple of either bits or 
   bytes.  For processing systems, the data unit is usually a multiple 
   of packets. 
    
5. Uses of Traffic Measurement 
    
   Traffic measurement is used to collect traffic data for the 
   following purposes: 
   . Traffic characterization and capacity planning 
   . Network monitoring 
   . Traffic control 
    
5.1 Traffic characterization 
    
   . Identifying traffic patterns, particularly traffic peak patterns, 
     and their variations in statistical analysis; this includes 
     developing traffic profiles to capture daily, weekly, or seasonal 
     variations. 
   . Determining traffic distributions in the network on the basis of 
     flows, interfaces, links, nodes, node-pairs, paths, or 
     destinations. 
   . Estimation of the traffic load according to service classes in 
     different routers and the network. 
   . Observing trends for traffic growth and forecasting of traffic 
     demands. 
    
   For example, traffic engineering measurements are usually used to 
   determine the statistical moments of a traffic flow.  As suggested 
   in [15], given the time series of packet arrivals, a suitable 
  
Lai, et al              Category - Expiration                [Page 5] 
Internet-Draft  Framework for Internet Traffic Measurement    Jan 2003 
 
 
   parametric stochastic model based on the mean and variance of the 
   time series can be constructed.  This traffic model is then used in 
   the ensuing phases of traffic engineering, such as link dimensioning 
   to meet service objectives. 
    
5.2 Network monitoring 
    
   . Determining the operational state of the network, including fault 
     detection. 
   . Monitoring the continuity and quality of network services, to 
     ensure that QoS/GoS objectives are met for various classes of 
     traffic, to verify the performance of delivered services, or to 
     serve as a means of sectionalizing performance issues seen by a 
     customer.  [QoS reflects the performance perceivable by a user of 
     a service, while GoS (grade of service) is used by a service 
     provider for internal design and operation of a network.] 
   . Evaluating the effectiveness of traffic engineering policies, or 
     triggering certain policy-based actions (such as alarm generation, 
     or path preemption) upon threshold crossing; this may be based on 
     the use of performance history data. 
   . Verifying peering agreements between service providers by 
     monitoring/measuring the traffic flows over interconnecting links 
     at border routers (note that peers are in general not willing to 
     divulge detailed traffic picture inside their autonomous systems); 
     this includes the estimation of inter- and intra-network traffic, 
     as well as originating, terminating, and transit traffic that are 
     being exchanged between peers. 
    
   An example of using traffic measurements in this area might be 
   monitoring packet loss rates at various points in a network to 
   detect apparent link failure.  Another example is monitoring the QoS 
   delivered to external peers by an autonomous system to ensure that 
   peering agreements are met. 
    
5.3 Traffic control 
    
   . Adaptively optimizing network performance in response to network 
     events, e.g., rerouting to work around congestion or failures. 
   . Providing a feedback mechanism in the reverse flow messaging of 
     RSVP-TE or CR-LDP signaling in MPLS to report on actual topology 
     state information such as link bandwidth availability. 
   . Support of measurement-based admission control, i.e., by 
     predicting the future demands of the aggregate of existing flows 
     so that admission decisions can be made on new flows. 
    
   An example of traffic engineering measurements used to effect a 
   traffic control mechanism is to configure policing mechanisms in 
   response to traffic load and performance measurements.  A network 
   operator could selectively throttle low-priority flows to improve 
   near-real-time performance of higher-priority flows, and maintain 
   tighter QoS envelopes.  Another example would be to use measurement 
   results for feedback into IGP routing decisions, e.g., for adjusting 
   the link weights based on them.

6. Time Scales for Network Operations 
    
   The information collected by traffic measurement can be provided to 
   the end user or application either in real time, or for record 
   (i.e., data retention) in non-real time, depending on the activities 
   to be performed and the network actions to be taken.  Traffic 
   control will generally require real-time information.  For network 
   planning and capacity management as described below, information may 
   be provided in non-real time after the processing of raw data. 
    
   Broadly speaking, the following three time scales can be classified, 
   according to the use of observed traffic information for network 
   operations [15]. 
    
   Network planning 
   Information that changes on the order of months is used to make 
   traffic forecasts as a basis for network extensions and long-term 
   network configuration.  That is, for planning the topology of the 
   network, planning alternative routes to survive failures or 
   determining where capacity must be augmented in advance of projected 
   traffic growth.  Long-term planning includes the selection and 
   timing of the introduction of new architectures, technologies and 
   vendors, in alignment with financial forecasts and market 
   assessments. 
    
   Capacity management 
   Intermediate-scale (e.g., six months or less) capacity planning 
   deals with detailed implementation of the build plan, short-lead-
   time activities and out-of-plan events.  It typically uses a 
   rolling-month forecast of traffic and demand.  Information that 
   changes on the order of days or hours is used to manage the deployed 
   facilities, by taking appropriate maintenance or engineering actions 
   to optimize utilization.  For example, new MPLS tunnels may be set 
   up or existing tunnels modified while meeting service level 
   agreements.  Also, load balancing may be performed, or traffic may 
   be rerouted for re-optimization after a failure. 
    
   Real-time network control 
   Information that changes on the order of minutes or less is used to 
   adapt to the current network conditions in near real time.  Thus, to 
   combat localized congestion, traffic management actions may perform 
   temporary rerouting to redistribute the load.  Upon detecting a 
   failure, traffic may be diverted to pre-established, secondary 
   routes until more optimized routes can be arranged. 
    
7. Read-Out Periods 
    
   A measurement infrastructure must be able to scale with the size and 
   the speed of a network as it evolves.  Hence, it is important to 
   minimize the amount of data to be collected, and to condense the 
   collected data by periodic summarization.  This is to prevent 
   network performance from being adversely affected by the 
  
Lai, et al              Category - Expiration                [Page 7] 
Internet-Draft  Framework for Internet Traffic Measurement    Jan 2003 
 
 
   unnecessarily excessive loading of router control processors, router 
   memories, transmission facilities, and the administrative support 
   systems.  For example, offline bulk file transfer may be used as a 
   method to manage large volumes of measured traffic data.  Bulk 
   transfer from routers to collection devices can help reduce the 
   packet processing overhead experienced by using other management 
   interfaces.  Also, data correlation or filtering rules may be set up 
   to suppress redundant data, or to aggregate flows into suitable 
   classes with the corresponding aggregation of statistics.  These 
   types of data reduction may be used as an appropriate or acceptable 
   means for pruning down the overall volume of traffic data that a TE 
   system may ultimately have to store, maintain, and process. 
    
   A measurement interval is the time interval over which measurements 
   are taken.  Some traffic data must be collected continuously, while 
   others by sampling, or on a scheduled basis.  For example, peak 
   loads and peak periods can be identified only by continuous 
   measurement as traffic typically fluctuates irregularly during the 
   whole day.  If traffic variations are regular and predictable, it 
   may be possible to measure the expected normal load on pre-
   determined portions of the day.  Such duration of peak traffic is 
   referred to as a busy period.  Special studies on selected segments 
   of the network may be conducted on a scheduled basis.  Occasionally 
   unexpected events or other decision support needs may arise that 
   require ad-hoc, unscheduled measurement, with the involvement of 
   network operator, and in such a case measurements may be activated 
   manually.  For instance, active throughput measurement may be used 
   to identify alternate routes for spreading traffic during periods of 
   network congestion. 
    
   A measurement interval consists of a sequence of consecutive read-
   out periods.  Summarization is usually done by integrating the raw 
   data over a pre-specified read-out period.  The granularity of this 
   period must be suitably chosen.  It should be short enough to 
   capture, with acceptable accuracy, the bursty nature of the traffic, 
   i.e., the traffic variations and peaks.  Since measurements 
   represent a load for the router (if third-party measurement devices 
   are not employed), the read-out period should not be so short that 
   router performance is degraded while a voluminous quantity of data 
   is produced.   Also, read-out may be started when the measured data 
   exceeds a preset threshold, or when the space allocated for 
   temporarily holding the data in a router is exhausted. 
    
   For a multi-service IP-based network, each service typically has its 
   own traffic characteristics and performance objectives.  To ensure 
   that service-specific features are reflected in the measurement 
   process, different read-out periods may be needed for different 
   classes of service. 
    
   The concept of read-out periods applies to both active and passive 
   measurements.  This concept is consistent with the sampling issues 
   for a series of measurements as developed in [2], for example.  See 
   sections 10 and 11 of that document for important distinctions 
  
Lai, et al              Category - Expiration                [Page 8] 
Internet-Draft  Framework for Internet Traffic Measurement    Jan 2003 
 
 
   between "singletons, samples, and statistics."  The procedure of 
   Poisson sampling, for example, may be used within a read-out period 
   to select a subset of total packet events that are chosen as the 
   sample.  Then a statistic (e.g., mean or variance) can be computed 
   over that sample and associated with the read-out period.  Although 
   [2] does not discuss traffic volume measures such as a traffic 
   matrix, the same sampling issues arise for the traffic matrix and 
   other passive measurements. 
    
8. Measurement Bases 
    
   Measurements can be classified on the basis of where, and at which 
   level of aggregation the traffic data are gathered.  This is similar 
   to the concept of a *population of interest* as specified in ITU-T 
   Recommendation I.380/Y.1540.  As defined therein, this refers to a 
   set of packets, possibly relative to a particular pair of source and 
   destination hosts, for the purposes of defining performance 
   parameters.  However, measurement bases as used here may not have 
   any association with a source-destination pair. 
    
   In this document, the focus is on service providers as organizations 
   requiring traffic and performance measurements.  (However, customer-
   based measurements of enterprise networks may have similar issues.)  
   Service providers will make decisions on how to perform the 
   measurements needed, and there are various tradeoffs involved.  One 
   option is to obtain the measurements directly from the network 
   elements themselves, e.g., via SNMP (Simple Network Management 
   Protocol).  Collecting the measurements on the operational network 
   elements such as routers is sometimes a performance concern.  
   Currently, there are a number of third-party measurement/monitoring 
   products available.  Hence, another option is to deploy such 
   equipment, which might have performance advantages but also 
   introduces additional cost. 
    
   Regardless of the type of measurement source, either a network 
   element or a third-party product, measurements should be collected, 
   as far as possible, by a measurement source without requiring 
   coordination with other measurement sources.  Thus, it is desirable 
   to perform those measurements that do not require the use of 
   specialized monitoring equipment connected to the network at 
   multiple locations.  While each measurement source may act 
   autonomously with regard to taking measurements, a network operator 
   may specify some network-wide policy regarding measurement 
   scheduling.  Such policy may be, say, the use of the same time of 
   day, the same measurement interval, or measurement intervals that 
   are multiples of each other (e.g., nested intervals with 
   synchronized boundaries).  A schedule therefore should include such 
   time information as the start, the duration, and periodicity of a 
   certain measurement. 
    
   The following measurement bases are considered in this document: 
   . Flow-based 
   . Interface-based, link-based, node-based

Internet-Draft  Framework for Internet Traffic Measurement    Jan 2003 
 
 
   . Node-pair-based 
   . Path-based 
    
   Generally speaking, for traffic engineering purposes, passive 
   measurements are mostly used.  However, as to be described later in 
   the "Measurement Types" section, the above measurement bases may 
   result in active or passive measurements.  For example, an active 
   measurement may be a two-point delay metric such as type-P-one-way-
   delay defined in [4], and obtained by time-stamping probe packets at 
   selected ingress and egress points; a passive measurement may be to 
   obtain packet inter-arrival times by time-stamping at a selected 
   point in the network successive packets of the offered traffic.  
   Note that both active and passive measurements are subject to the 
   same sampling and time-source accuracy concerns. 
    
   MPLS has certain advantages when compared with conventional IP 
   networks, from the perspective of the difficulty involved in 
   obtaining unambiguous measurements.  As different service providers 
   will adopt different technologies, technology-neutral solutions to 
   the problem of obtaining measurements are presented as far as 
   possible. 
    
   Applicability of traffic measurements to the derivation of traffic 
   matrix statistics and performance monitoring are to be described in 
   later sections. 
    
8.1 Flow-based 
    
   This is conceptually similar to the call detail record (CDR) in 
   circuit-switched telecommunications networks.  It is primarily used 
   on interfaces at access routers, edge routers, or aggregation 
   routers where traffic originates or terminates, rather than on 
   backbone routers in the core network.  Like CDR measurements, flow-
   based records are used to collect detailed information about a flow.  
   This includes such information as source and destination IP 
   addresses/port numbers, protocol, type of service, timestamps for 
   the start and end of a flow, packet count, octet count, etc. 
    
   As flow is a fine-grained object, measuring every flow that passes 
   through all the edge devices may not be scalable or feasible.  
   Hence, per-flow data are usually used in a special study conducted 
   on a non-continuous schedule and on selected routers only.  Sampling 
   of flow-based measurements may also be needed to reduce both the 
   amount of data collected and the associated overhead. 
    
8.2 Interface-based, link-based, node-based 
    
   While active measurements are often not useful at a single point, 
   passive measurements can be taken at each network element.  For 
   example, SNMP uses passive monitoring to collect raw data on an 
   interface at an edge or backbone router.  These data are stored in 
   MIBs (Management Information Bases) and include counts on packets 
   and octets sent/received, packet discards, errored packets.  Such 
  
Lai, et al              Category - Expiration               [Page 10] 
Internet-Draft  Framework for Internet Traffic Measurement    Jan 2003 
 
 
   measurements may have the disadvantage that the identity of each 
   flow is lost. 
    
   To reduce the overhead in managing multiple links between the same 
   ingress and egress points, there is proposal to aggregate links for 
   network optimization [16].  Component links in such a *bundled link* 
   will have the same routing constraints, resource classes, and 
   attributes.  Multiple links are treated as a single IP link.  
   Traffic measurements, such as bandwidth availability, throughput, 
   etc., should consider the measurement implications for bundled 
   links, and should not inhibit link bundling.  Also, such 
   measurements should be protocol independent and media independent to 
   ensure portability and commonality in the measurements. 
    
8.3 Node-pair-based 
    
   Active measurements by probing, as specified in the IPPM framework 
   for example, can be conducted between each pair of major routing 
   hubs for determining edge-to-edge performance of a core network.  
   This complements the passive measurements of the previous sub-
   section, which provide local views of the performance of individual 
   network elements. 
    
   In contrast to performance statistics, traffic loading statistics 
   require passive measurements of the actual traffic.  In circuit-
   switched telecommunications networks, each established call has an 
   associated source/destination node-pair.  By maintaining a set of 
   node-pair data registers (usage, peg count, overflow, etc) in each 
   switch, node-pair-based measurements for traffic statistics such as 
   the load between a given node pair are taken directly.  In IP-based 
   networks, currently such node-pair-based measurements are difficult 
   to establish due to the dynamic and asymmetric properties of IP 
   routing.  However, it is possible to infer them from flow-based 
   passive measurements and other network information, such as routing 
   table snapshots.  A problem with this approach is that flow-based 
   measurement data are voluminous.  Also, another problem that must be 
   accounted for is the routing changes among the multiple routes due 
   to, e.g., a change in the configuration of intradomain routing, or a 
   change in interdomain policies made by another autonomous system.  
   This is further discussed in the Section on Traffic Matrix 
   Statistics. 
    
8.4 Path-based 
    
   The ability of MPLS to use fixed preferred paths for routing 
   traffic, so-called route pinning, gives the means to develop path-
   based measurements.  This may enable the development of 
   methodologies for such functions as admission control and 
   performance verification of delivered service. 
    
   Like a flow, a path is associated with a pair of nodes.  However, 
   path is a more coarse-grained object than flow, as paths are usually 
   used to carry aggregated traffic.  In addition, when routing changes 
  
Lai, et al              Category - Expiration               [Page 11] 
Internet-Draft  Framework for Internet Traffic Measurement    Jan 2003 
 
 
   occur, the amount of traffic to be carried by a path will either not 
   be affected or be merged with that of another path.  Because of 
   these properties, path-based measurements are more scalable and may 
   be used to provide more readily an accurate, network-wide, view of 
   the traffic demands.  For example, the traffic between a given pair 
   of nodes may be inferred from the aggregate of the traffic carried 
   by all paths either terminated by or passed through the same node-
   pair. 
    
9. Measurement Entities 
    
   A measurement entity defines what is measured: it is a quantity for 
   which data collection must be performed with a certain measurement.  
   A measurement type can be specified by a (meaningful) combination of 
   a measurement entity with the measurement basis described in the 
   previous section. 
    
9.1 Entities related to traffic and performance 
    
   Some of the measurement entities listed below, such as throughput, 
   delay, delay variation, and packet loss, are related to the 
   respective IPPM performance metrics or the I.380/Y.1540 performance 
   parameters. 
    
   . Traffic volume (mean and variance, in number of bits, bytes, or 
     packets transferred, as counted over a given time interval), on a 
     per service class basis, at various aggregation levels (IP address 
     prefix, interface, link, node, node-pair, path, network edge, 
     customer, or autonomous system) 
     Note:  (1) This is a measurement for the traffic carried by a 
     network, a network segment, or an individual network element; it 
     is used to derive the carried load or carried traffic intensity 
     [17].  When measured during the busy period, this entity is 
     normally used to estimate the traffic offered.  However, the 
     estimation procedure should take into account such factors as 
     congestion, which may result in decreased carried traffic.  In 
     addition, congestion may lead to user behavior such as reattempt 
     or abandonment, which may affect the actual traffic offered.  (2) 
     To reduce uncertainty in traffic estimation, second-order measures 
     may need to be developed.  Beyond the use of variance as in 
     current practice, further study is needed for the feasibility of 
     other second-order techniques.  (3) Measurement of traffic volumes 
     over interconnecting links at border routers can be used to 
     estimate the traffic exchange between peers for contract 
     verification. 
      
   . Average holding time (e.g., flow duration or lifetime, duration of 
     an MPLS path), on a per service class basis 
     Note:  (1) When MPLS traffic engineering is used, this is similar 
     to call holding time in telecommunications networks.  Peg count, 
     usage, and call holding time are three busy-hour entities that 
     should be independently measured for both call-dependent and load-
     dependent engineering.  This is important especially when the call 
  
Lai, et al              Category - Expiration               [Page 12] 
Internet-Draft  Framework for Internet Traffic Measurement    Jan 2003 
 
 
     busy hour and the load busy hour during a day are non-coincident, 
     due to the hour-to-hour variation of call holding times.  (2) The 
     holding time statistics of long-living static paths reflect the 
     effect of network equipment failures, link outages, or scheduled 
     maintenance, and hence may to used to derive information about up-
     time or service availability. 
      
   . Available bandwidth of a link or path - useful for load balancing, 
     measurement-based admission control to determine the feasibility 
     of creating a new MPLS tunnel (real-time information can be used 
     for dynamic establishment) 
    
   . Throughput (in bits per second, bytes per second, or packets per 
     second) 
     Note:  (1) This is a measure of the "goodput."  That is, the rate 
     at which a given amount of traffic excluding lost, misdelivered, 
     or errored packets, that passes between a set of end points, where 
     end points can be logically or physically defined.  The condition 
     of the network, e.g., normal or high load, under which the 
     measurement is taken should be noted.  (2) The protocol level at 
     which a throughput measurement is taken must be specified, as the 
     packet payload and packet overheads are protocol dependent.  (3) 
     The average packet size may be inferred from the bit rate and 
     packet rate measurements, when performed on the basis of an 
     individual router.  This quantity is useful to gauge router 
     performance, since router operations are typically packet-oriented 
     and small packets are more processing-intensive. 
      
   . Delay (e.g., cross-router delay from node-based measurement may be 
     used to measure queueing delay within a router; end-to-end one-way 
     or round-trip packet delay can be obtained by node-pair-based 
     measurement) 
     Note: The condition of the network, e.g., normal or high load, 
     under which the measurement is taken should be noted.  This is 
     useful to determine if delay objectives are met. 
      
   . Delay variation 
     Note:  There are several methods to measure this quantity as 
     specified in ITU-T and IPPM.  (1) In Appendix II of I.380/Y.1540, 
     IP packet delay variation is defined via four alternative methods.  
     The first two methods define an end-to-end two-point delay 
     variation of a given packet, measured between two measurement 
     points (such as ingress and egress), as the difference between the 
     one-way delay of the given packet and some nominal delay.  This 
     nominal delay is chosen to be the first packet delay in the first 
     method and the average delay of the population of packets in the 
     second method.  The third alternative, interval-based method, 
     measures the percentage of packets with delay variations that fall 
     outside some pre-specified delay variation interval.  Finally, the 
     quantile-based method measures the distance (in time units) 
     between pre-selected quantiles, e.g., 99.5 percentile and 0.5 
     percentile, of the delay variation distribution.  This method is 
     tighter than the interval-based method since it bounds the tail of 
  
Lai, et al              Category - Expiration               [Page 13] 
Internet-Draft  Framework for Internet Traffic Measurement    Jan 2003 
 
 
     the delay variation distribution.  In Y.1541, additional 
     considerations and more alternatives of delay variations are 
     described.  (2) In IPPM [9], the concept of a selection function 
     is introduced that allows for the explicit designation of selected 
     packets whose one-way delay values are compared to compute one-way 
     delay variation.  For example, to define a method of measurement, 
     a selection function can be specified to select the consecutive 
     packets within a specified interval, or to select the maximum and 
     minimum one-way delays within a specified interval. 
      
   . Packet loss 
     Note:  (1) While packet losses due to transmission and/or protocol 
     errors may not be traffic related, unexpected excessive loss may 
     be used as a means of fault detection.  (2) Packet losses due to 
     policing or network congestion should be distinguished.  The 
     former is a result of user violation of service contract and the 
     network operator should not be penalized for it.  The latter, 
     whether intentional or unintentional, is caused by network 
     conditions such as buffer overflow, router forwarding process 
     busy, and may not be the user's fault.  When policing is done by a 
     network, measurement of non-conforming packets at the edge 
     provides an indication on the extent to which the network is 
     carrying this type of packets (which can potentially be dropped if 
     network gets congested).  Loss due to congestion of any packets, 
     including loss of non-conforming packets, is a useful measure in 
     traffic engineering to account for resource management.  (3) Long-
     term averages can be measured by the I.380/Y.1540 IP packet loss 
     ratio or by the IPPM Poisson sampling of one-way loss.  However, 
     during the convergence times associated with routing updating, the 
     loss may be high enough as to cause service unavailability.  This 
     effect needs to be captured and statistics such as loss patterns, 
     burst loss, or severe loss ratio may be useful. 
      
   . Resource usage, such as link/router utilization, buffer occupancy 
     (e.g., fraction of arriving packets finding the buffer above a 
     given set of thresholds) 
     Note:  (1) Depending on the architecture of a router, router 
     utilization measurements may include processor and memory (e.g., 
     forwarding tables) utilization for each of the line cards and/or 
     the central unit.  (2) Trigger points may be set when resource 
     usage consistently exceeds a certain threshold. 
      
9.2 Entities related to establishment of connection or path 
    
   Where connection admission control is used, a measurement entity for 
   monitoring network performance may be the proportion of connections 
   denied admission.  Also, it may be useful to score the requested 
   bandwidth within the traffic parameters for the setup request.  
   Corresponding to the number of call attempts (i.e., peg count) in 
   telecommunications networks, the number of connection requests, the 
   number of flows, etc., may be measured in given read-out periods to 
   characterize the traffic. 
    
  
Lai, et al              Category - Expiration               [Page 14] 
Internet-Draft  Framework for Internet Traffic Measurement    Jan 2003 
 
 
   To characterize paths for MPLS traffic engineering, the following 
   measurement entities may be defined: path setup delay, path setup 
   error probability, path setup denial (blocking) probability, path 
   release delay, path disconnect probability, path restoration time. 
    
10. Measurement Types 
    
   A measurement matrix can be defined wherein each column represents a 
   measurement basis and each row represents a measurement entity.  An 
   entry in this measurement matrix, corresponding to a meaningful and 
   measurable combination of an entity and a basis, defines a 
   particular measurement type.  For each measurement type, there 
   should be a set of measurement points specified to bound the network 
   segment for the purposes of taking measurement.  A measurement point 
   may be the physical boundary between a node and an adjacent link, or 
   the logical interface between two protocol layers in a protocol 
   stack. 
    
10.1 Measurement types related to traffic or performance 
    
   The following measurement matrix illustrates some of the measurement 
   types related to traffic or performance.  Potentially, there can be 
   one such matrix for each service class.  Since this table is for 
   illustration purposes, it is not necessary for a service provider to 
   implement all the measurement types below. 
    
            Bases:     Flow     Interface,   Node Pair      Path 
                                   Node                       
  Entities:          (passive)   (passive)     (both)      (both) 
  Traffic Volume        x(1)         x          x(3)        x(3) 
  Avg. Hold. Time        x                                  x(3) 
  Avail. Bandwidth                   x                      x(3) 
  Throughput                                    x(4)        x(4) 
  Delay                             x(2)        x(4)        x(4) 
  Delay Variation                   x(2)        x(4)        x(4) 
  Packet Loss                        x          x(5)        x(5) 
    
   Notes: 
   (1) This measurement type can be used to derive flow size 
   statistics. 
   (2) These are 1-point measurements. 
   (3) As a starting point, statistics collected by passive measurement 
   through the MIBs useful for traffic engineering [18, 19, 20] may be 
   used. 
   (4) Active measurements based on IPPM metrics are currently in use 
   for node-pairs; they may be developed for paths.  
   (5) Besides active measurements based on IPPM, path loss may 
   possibly be inferred from the difference between ingress and egress 
   traffic statistics at the two endpoints of a path.  However, such 
   inference for the cumulative losses between a given node pair over 
   multiple routes may be less useful, since different routes may have 
   different loss characteristics.

10.2 Measurement types related to resource usage 
    
   Another measurement matrix can be constructed for resource 
   consumption.  This leads to a set of measurement types comprising 
   the different usage, one for each network resource object such as 
   router (processor and memory), link, and buffer, by different 
   classes of traffic: 
    
   . control (e.g., routing control) traffic 
   . signaling traffic 
   . user traffic from different service classes 
    
                        Bases:   Node     Link    Buffer 
           Entities: 
           Control Util.           x        x        x 
           Signaling Util.         x        x        x 
           Service Class Util.     x        x        x 
    
   The amount of control and signaling traffic carried by a network is 
   a function of many factors.  To name a few, they include the size 
   and topology of the network, the control and signaling protocols 
   used, the amount of user traffic carried, the number of failure 
   events, etc.  Also, flooding of link-state advertisement (LSA) 
   messages in Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP, such as OSPF or IS-IS) 
   may cause significant routing control traffic during events such as 
   an LSA storm as a result of failures due to fiber cuts or failed 
   power supply.  The above utilization measurements for control and 
   signaling traffic are intended to help develop guidelines for the 
   proper dimensioning and apportionment of network resources so that a 
   given level of user traffic can be adequately supported.  As the 
   primary focus here is on user traffic measurements, the additional 
   needs and properties of control and signaling traffic measurements 
   are beyond the scope of this document. 
    
11. Traffic Matrix Statistics 
    
   An important set of data for traffic engineering is point-to-point 
   or point-to-multipoint demands.  This data is needed in the 
   provisioning of intradomain routes and external peering in the 
   existing network, as well as planning for the placement and sizing 
   of new links, routers, or peers. 
    
   In current practice, estimates for traffic demands are usually 
   determined from a combination of traffic projections, customer 
   prescriptions, and service level agreements.  Under existing mode of 
   operation, it is not easy to obtain network-wide traffic demands 
   from the local interface measurements taken by different IP routers. 
   As explained in [21, 22], information from diverse network 
   measurements and various configuration files are needed to infer the 
   traffic volume.  Besides raw measurement data, additional 
   information such as topological data and router configuration data 

  
Lai, et al              Category - Expiration               [Page 16] 
Internet-Draft  Framework for Internet Traffic Measurement    Jan 2003 
 
 
   are required to obtain a network view.  Furthermore, destination-
   based routing/forwarding in IGP provides a network operator with 
   primitive and limited control over the routing of traffic flows.  
   This necessitates the association of a time sequence of forwarding 
   tables from different routers to reconstruct the different routes 
   used by the network over time. By using this auxiliary information, 
   together with flow-based measurements, the above-cited references 
   describe how to determine the traffic volume from an ingress link to 
   a set of egress links by validating and joining various data sets 
   together. 
    
   As described in Section 8.3, some shortcomings in today's method to 
   derive traffic matrix statistics as above include the volume of data 
   from flow-based measurement, the lack of sufficient routing control 
   information, and the need to correlate data from a variety of 
   sources.  The routing control offered by MPLS can be used to avoid 
   some of these deficiencies.  To take advantage of this capability, 
   path-based passive measurement should be developed.  Furthermore, as 
   explained in the Section on Path-based Measurement Bases, by 
   aggregating the appropriate set of path-based traffic data, the 
   corresponding node-pair-based traffic data can be obtained.  This 
   will facilitate the derivation of traffic matrix statistics, 
   possibly on a per service class basis.  Note that in the case of 
   hop-by-hop routed label-switched paths that are established by Label 
   Distribution Protocol (LDP) signaling, there is no explicit binding 
   between path end points.  This will result in the use of different 
   label bindings at both the ingress and egress nodes over time as 
   network topology changes.  Although the forwarding equivalence class 
   (FEC) to label binding information already exists in the MPLS FTN 
   and LSR MIBs [23, 18], a mechanism is needed to keep track of 
   binding changes.  An example of such a mechanism may be the periodic 
   exchange of FEC to label binding information for each ingress-egress 
   pair. 
    
   Besides traffic engineering, a major application of MPLS is the 
   support of network-based virtual private networks (VPNs).  A VPN can 
   be an enterprise network or a carrier's carrier network.  It is not 
   the purpose of this document to discuss VPNs.  However, it is 
   relevant to highlight the use of traffic measurements to maintain 
   proper engineering and performance of MPLS tunnels in the support of 
   VPNs between VPN sites.  This would include also the support for 
   MPLS-based pseudo-wire connections as developed by the PWE3 Working 
   Group [24].  For example, path-based measurement by a network 
   operator on behalf of the VPN customers facilitates the estimation 
   of the traffic offered by these VPNs. 
    
12. Performance Monitoring 
    
   General aspects of measurements required to support the operation, 
   administration, and maintenance of a network are outside the scope 
   of this document (see [25, 26, 27] for a discussion of MPLS OAM).  
   The focus of the measurements here is only on operations related to 
   traffic engineering and network performance management. 
  
Lai, et al              Category - Expiration               [Page 17] 
Internet-Draft  Framework for Internet Traffic Measurement    Jan 2003 
 
 
    
   A major component of performance management is performance 
   monitoring, i.e., continuous real-time monitoring of the quality or 
   health of the network and its various elements to ensure a 
   sustained, uninterrupted delivery of quality service.  This requires 
   the use of measurement, either passively or actively, to collect 
   information about the operational state of the network and to track 
   its performance.  For a discussion of passive monitoring and the use 
   of synthetic traffic sources in active probing, see [28].  Alarms 
   may be generated when the state of a network element exceeds 
   prescribed thresholds. 
    
   Performance degradation can occur as a result of routing 
   instability, congestion, or failure of network components.  Periods 
   of congestion may be detected when the resource usage of a network 
   segment consistently exceeds a certain threshold, or when the cross-
   router delay is unexpectedly high.  Unexpected excessive loss of 
   packets or throughput drops may be used as a means of fault 
   detection, and may result in restoration activities. 
    
   Internet utilities such as ping and traceroute have been useful to 
   help diagnose network problems and performance debugging.  Utilities 
   with similar functions would be essential for path-oriented 
   operations like in MPLS.  This would include the capability to list, 
   at any time, (1) for a given path, all the nodes traversed by it, 
   and (2) for a given node, all the paths originating from it, 
   transiting through it, and/or terminating on it.  A proposal for 
   route tracing is described in [29]. 
    
13. Packet Sampling 
    
   A wide spectrum of operational applications can be built on traffic 
   measurement.  However, different applications usually require 
   traffic measurements at different levels of temporal and spatial 
   granularity.  To achieve an effective tradeoff between 
   implementation complexity and the range of operational tasks to be 
   enabled, a passive measurement framework based on packet sampling is 
   proposed in [30].   
    
   The use of packet sampling has two motivations.  First, the enormous 
   volumes of traffic require that some form of data reduction to be 
   used.  Second, simple data reduction by aggregation at the 
   measurement point will not provide sufficiently detailed views for 
   all network management applications or exploratory studies.  For 
   this reason, packet sampling is proposed as a means to reduce data 
   volume while still retaining representative detail. 
    
   The primary aim of the proposal [30] is to define a minimal set of 
   primitive packet selection operations out of which all sampling 
   operations that are necessary to support measurement-based 
   applications can be composed.  Operations currently under 
   consideration include filtering and statistical sampling, and also 
   hash-based packet selection, a method that can be used to support

   the determination of spatial traffic flows across a domain [31].  
   Whichever method is used, the interpretation of the stream of 
   measurements arising from sampled packets must be both transparent 
   and standard.  Other goals are to specify a means to format and 
   export measurements, and a means to manage the configuration of the 
   sampling and export operations. 
    
   The proposal positions these function to provide a basic packet 
   sampled measurement service to higher level "consumers."  A typical 
   consumer is a network management application that sits behind a 
   remote measurement collector.  Such measurements can support 
   applications for a number of tasks: troubleshooting, demand 
   characterization, scenario evaluation and what-ifs.  Another type of 
   consumer is a higher level on-router measurement application.   
   One potential class of examples is composite measurements (e.g., 
   interpacket delay statistics) formed from a number of individual 
   packet measurements.  Another class is network security 
   applications, e.g., IP traceback [32].  For some applications, the 
   ability to have low latency between packet measurement and reporting 
   will be particularly useful.  
    
14. Statistical Estimation and Information Modeling  
    
   This section deals with engineering methods in statistical 
   estimation, as well as the need for an information model and 
   associated repository schema for the measurements. 
    
14.1 Engineering methods for statistical estimation of measures 
    
   The use of the well-established methods of optimal estimation [33, 
   34, 35, 36] to obtain estimates of the measures for TE is 
   recommended.  This draws upon several facts: 
    
   . Internet traffic is inherently band-limited, but non-stationary;  
   . Internet traffic may be heavy-tailed and possess strong short-term 
     correlations; 
   . A stationary, band-limited process can be approximated arbitrarily 
     closely by optimal estimation methods based on a finite number of 
     past samples. 
    
   Standard procedures for de-trending the raw data to provide "trend + 
   stationary" decompositions should be adopted.  An example is the use 
   of Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models, where 
   first differences are applied to the raw (non-stationary) data, 
   yielding a stationary derived process.  Then, the methods of optimal 
   estimation can be applied in a practical setting (e.g., finite sample 
   counts) to the derived stationary process to produce quality 
   estimates of the measures defined herein.  As the original raw 
   process may be any of the measurements discussed in this document, 
   the above procedure may be applied without loss of generality to 
   measures of delay, loss, or complex measures of network state such as 
   path characteristics, etc. 
    
  
Lai, et al              Category - Expiration               [Page 19] 
Internet-Draft  Framework for Internet Traffic Measurement    Jan 2003 
 
 
   In addition, these methods need to be applied across multiple time-
   scales, so that TE applications can work with measures related to: 
   . long-term trends over days, weeks, and months; 
   . busy-hour characterizations; and 
   . statistics and correlation properties on the order of seconds [37]. 
    
   The above estimation procedures apply equally to traffic workload, 
   traffic performance, or other estimates of network state, such as the 
   state of routes. 
    
14.2 TE Measure Information Modeling 
    
   An information model is valuable for organizing data generated 
   through the estimation process.  An information model is needed for 
   TE measures because a complete model does not exist for these 
   measures.  Measures must be associated with a large, and sometimes 
   complicated set of attributes (e.g., as simple as an IP address of a 
   measurement point, or as complex as the path of a round-trip 
   measurement).  
    
   Information models exist that richly describe network elements and 
   their configuration [38].  These models have been extended to include 
   policy mechanisms [39].  Specifications for flows have been developed 
   for network resource allocation purposes [40].  No centralized 
   information model exists that can completely describe many of the TE 
   measures defined herein.  Therefore, necessary integrating 
   information models that make maximal reuse of pre-existing work may 
   need to be developed for TE measures.  
    
   As a brief example of the limitations of existing information models, 
   consider RFC 1363 [40] as a model for a traffic flow.  It can be 
   described as collection of attributes defining traffic offered load, 
   performance to be delivered (a goal), and the assurance level (risk) 
   associated with the actual performance obtained.  The traffic offered 
   load is specified via an envelope described by a token bucket concept 
   (token bucket rate, bucket size) and a maximum transmission rate. 
    
   This model, while clearly intended for description of what a network 
   will tolerate of a flow, could also be used to describe a flow in a 
   TE measure sense, e.g., "a flow that lives within the token rate x 
   and size y with probability 0.999."  Note that a probability 
   statement must be added to complete the characterization.  This type 
   of specification is known as (sigma, rho) in the literature.  Also, 
   note that adopting such an information model for flows lacks any 
   flexibility to specify time scale, or more detailed second-order 
   statistics. 
    
   Similar limitations exist with respect to delivered performance 
   specification in RFC1363, and the text of the RFC is quick to point 
   out, for example, that the "loss model is crude."  For these reasons, 
   and others, an appropriate information model is needed for TE 
   measures that can support uniformity of data definition in subsequent 
   TE applications. 
  
Lai, et al              Category - Expiration               [Page 20] 
Internet-Draft  Framework for Internet Traffic Measurement    Jan 2003 
 
 
    
   Several approaches and options for repository technology are now 
   broadly discussed.  Relationships between TE measure information 
   models on other information models (e.g., COPS) that drive network 
   outcomes are of particular importance. 
    
   Linkages may need to be considered between policy mechanisms and TE 
   measures.  This is useful because, while policy-driven networking is 
   well-developed between the policy repositories, policy control points 
   and policy enforcement, policy content is very likely the output of 
   TE applications.  Since TE applications are dependent upon TE 
   measures, it is advantageous to provide traceability between the 
   measures and the engineering changes made as a consequence of them.  
    
   Measures (represented by their estimates) should be centrally stored 
   and collected in a logical sense.  This does not preclude distributed 
   storage for purposes of volume management or security/survivability, 
   but alludes to the need for a consistent retrieval mechanism (e.g., 
   NFS).  Two methods are: (1) extend MIBs with new definitions for TE 
   measure estimates, and (2) create data depositories through more 
   centralized facilities, such as LDAP repositories.  Both methods have 
   merits as collection processes for TE measures, and are simple 
   examples spanning a wide spectrum of solutions.  These two methods 
   are discussed here for expository purposes, not to exclude other 
   solutions. 
    
   Using MIBs allows well-established SNMP protocol and related 
   applications to retrieve data from the network elements being 
   measured.  This is inherently "vendor-neutral," allowing commonly 
   defined TE measurements to be stored for retrieval in a common MIB 
   definition, regardless of network element vendor, technology or other 
   differences.  Measurements from individual network elements 
   (interfaces, routers, etc.) can be obtained "locally," if measures 
   from a single network element are sufficient for a given TE 
   application.  However, if a network-wide view of the measurements is 
   desired, the drawback of a MIB-based approach is that the data must 
   be retrieved from each element over the network.  As experience 
   attests, this approach sometimes generates significant SNMP traffic, 
   and during periods of high congestion (when measurements may be quite 
   important) SNMP may not reliably fetch the measurement data. Finally, 
   a MIB-based approach may be difficult to implement for various two-
   point measurements, such as end-to-end, or round-trip delay and delay 
   variation.  Such measurements are not related to a single network 
   element, and somewhat heuristic practices (e.g., storing end-to-end 
   delay measurements in MIBs located on source address elements, etc.) 
   are required. 
    
   An LDAP repository approach centralizes the data storage.  This has 
   the advantage that TE applications (such as offline and online TE, or 
   measurement-based admission control) can be performed, and policy 
   database content can be updated without invasive retrieval of data 
   from network-wide MIBs.  Further, traceability can be established

Internet-Draft  Framework for Internet Traffic Measurement    Jan 2003 
 
 
   between the TE measurements in an LDAP repository, and the associated 
   policy content derived from them. 
    
   It is possible that both the MIB-based and LDAP-based (or another 
   approach altogether) should be considered jointly. 
    
15. Conclusions and Recommendations 
    
   This document is intended as a framework for traffic metrics needed 
   for successful TE.  Principles of best practice in traffic 
   characterization and performance characterization are described.  
   For interoperable compatibility, basic areas of traffic measurement 
   recommended for standardization include: 
    
   (1) specific TE measurements 
    
   . Use of node-pair-based traffic data to derive per-service-class 
     traffic matrix statistics 
   . Statistics of carried load versus performance 
   . A standardized mechanism to detect and record label binding 
     changes for LDP-signaled label-switched paths, to facilitate the 
     collection of node-pair-based traffic data 
    
   (2) traffic data collection methods 
 
   . Need for uniform measurement definitions across vendors and 
     operators 
   . Distinction between traffic offered load versus achieved 
     throughput 
   . Need for higher-order statistics for service assurance 
   . Need for packet-sampled measurements that preserve representative 
     traffic detail at manageable sample volumes 
   . Need for offline bulk file transfer and standardized 
     filtering/aggregation mechanisms to manage large volumes of 
     measured traffic data 
    
16. Security Considerations 
    
   The principles and concepts related to Internet traffic measurement 
   as discussed in this document do not by themselves affect the 
   security of the Internet.  However, it is assumed that any 
   measurement systems that are developed or deployed by a service 
   provider are responsible for providing sufficient data integrity 
   (e.g., to prevent forgery of measurement records) and 
   confidentiality (e.g., by restricting attention only to the packet 
   headers of interest).  It is also assumed that a service provider 
   will take proper precautions to ensure that access to its 
   measurement systems and all associated data is secure by using 
   appropriate authentication techniques.  Methods to achieve these 
   security considerations are not addressed in this document.
