NAME=VALUE  REQUIRED.  The name of the state information ("cookie")
      is NAME, and its value is VALUE.  NAMEs that begin with $ are
      reserved and MUST NOT be used by applications.  The VALUE is
      opaque to the user agent and may be anything the origin server
      chooses to send, possibly in a server-selected printable ASCII
      encoding.  "Opaque" implies that the content is of interest and
      relevance only to the origin server.  The content may, in fact, be
      readable by anyone that examines the Set-Cookie2 header.

Comment=value  OPTIONAL.  Because cookies can be used to derive or
      store private information about a user, the value of the Comment
      attribute allows an origin server to document how it intends to
      use the cookie.  The user can inspect the information to decide
      whether to initiate or continue a session with this cookie.
      Characters in value MUST be in UTF-8 encoding.  [RFC2279]

CommentURL="http_URL"  OPTIONAL.  Because cookies can be used to
      derive or store private information about a user, the CommentURL
      attribute allows an origin server to document how it intends to
      use the cookie.  The user can inspect the information identified
      by the URL to decide whether to initiate or continue a session
      with this cookie.

Max-Age=value  OPTIONAL.  The value of the Max-Age attribute is
      delta-seconds, the lifetime of the cookie in seconds, a decimal
      non-negative integer.  To handle cached cookies correctly, a
      client SHOULD calculate the age of the cookie according to the age
      calculation rules in the HTTP/1.1 specification [RFC2616].  When
      the age is greater than delta-seconds seconds, the client SHOULD
      discard the cookie.  A value of zero means the cookie SHOULD be
      discarded immediately.

SubPath=value  OPTIONAL.  The value of the Path attribute specifies
      the subset of URLs within the default path on the origin server to
      which this cookie applies.

Version=value  REQUIRED.  The value of the Version attribute, a
      decimal integer, identifies the version of the state management
      specification to which the cookie conforms.  For this
      specification, Version=2 applies.

cookie          =  "Cookie:" cookie-version 1*((";" | ",") cookie-value)
cookie-value    =  NAME "=" VALUE ";" path ";" domain [";" port]
cookie-version  =  "$Version" "=" value
NAME            =  attr
VALUE           =  value
path            =  "$Path" "=" value
domain          =  "$Domain" "=" value
port            =  "$Port" [ "=" <"> value <"> ]

   The value of the cookie-version attribute MUST be the value from the
   Version attribute of the corresponding Set-Cookie2 response header.
   Otherwise the value for cookie-version is 0.

   The value for the path attribute MUST be the value from the cookie's
   Path state attribute, as determined when the corresponding Set-
   Cookie2 response header was parsed.  If the cookie was set using a
   previous specification this value MUST be the value of the Path
   attribute of the corresponding response header, or the default path
   of the URI setting the cookie.

   The value for the domain attribute MUST be the value from the
   cookie's Domain state attribute, as determined when the corresponding
   Set-Cookie2 response header was parsed.  If the response header used
   the SubDomain attribute the domain value MUST be prefixed by a ".",
   if the Domain attribute is a default domain the domain value MUST NOT
   be prefixed by a ".".  If the cookie was set by host supporting a
   previous version this value MUST be the Domain attribute from the
   correponding header, including a preceding "." if the Domain
   attribute was present; if it was not present the domain value must be
   the name of the host setting the cookie, without being prefixed with
   a ".".

   The port attribute of the Cookie request header MUST mirror the Port
   attribute, if one was present, in the corresponding Set-Cookie2
   response header.  That is, the port attribute MUST be present if the
   Port attribute was present in the Set-Cookie2 header, and it MUST
   have the same value, if any.  Otherwise, if the Port attribute was
   absent from the Set-Cookie2 header, the attribute likewise MUST be
   omitted from the Cookie request header.

   Note that there is neither a Comment nor a CommentURL attribute in
   the Cookie request header corresponding to the ones in the Set-
   Cookie2 response header.  The user agent does not return the comment
   information to the origin server.

   The user agent applies the following rules to choose applicable
   cookie-values to send in Cookie request headers from among all the
   cookies it has received.

   Domain Selection  The origin server's effective host name MUST
      domain-match the Domain state attribute of the cookie.

   Port Selection  There are three possible behaviors, depending on the
      Port attribute in the Set-Cookie2 response header:

      1.  By default (no Port attribute), the cookie MAY be sent to any
          port.

      2.  If the attribute is present but has no value (e.g., Port), the
          cookie MUST only be sent to the request-port it was received
          from.

      3.  If the attribute has a port-list, the cookie MUST only be
          returned if the new request-port is one of those listed in
          port-list.

   Path Selection  The request-URI MUST path-match the Path state
      attribute of the cookie.

   Max-Age Selection  Cookies that have expired should have been
      discarded and thus are not forwarded to an origin server.

   If multiple cookies satisfy the criteria above, they are ordered in
   the Cookie header such that those with more specific Path attributes
   precede those with less specific.  Ordering with respect to other
   attributes (e.g., Domain) is unspecified.

   Note: For backward compatibility, the separator in the Cookie header
   is semi-colon (;) everywhere.  A server SHOULD also accept comma (,)
   as the separator between cookie-values for future compatibility.
