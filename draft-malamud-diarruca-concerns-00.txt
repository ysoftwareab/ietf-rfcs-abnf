Abstract

   The U.S. Congress, having hit a home run with the do-not-call list,
   has decided that since computers are like telephones, a do-not-email
   list ought to win them the pennant.  You have an opportunity to block
   that metaphor.  The FTC has issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed
   Rulemaking and has given the public until March 31, 2004 to respond.
   This document tells you how and explains the issues.

Terminology

   The key words "Good Thing(TM)", "Bad Thing(TM)", "Feature(c)", and
   "Bug(c)" in this document are to be interpreted as described in

1. Introduction

   The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has issued an Advanced Notice
   of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR), which is a formal agency action of
   notice and comment prior to rulemaking pursuant to the U.S.
   Administrative Procedures Act [USC] and is in response to the passage
   of the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 [CAN-SPAM] The ANPR is entitled
   "Definitions, Implementation, and Reporting Requirements Under the
   CAN-SPAM Act." [DIARRUCA]

   The request for public comment lists a variety of issues pertaining
   to implementation and reporting requirements of the CAN-SPAM Act of
   2003.  This document only addresses a subset of the issues raised,
   including:

   o  Section 9(a) and sec. 9(b) of the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 mandates
      that the Commission submit a report "setting forth a plan and
      timetable for establishing a nationwide marketing Do Not E-mail
      Registry."  In response, the Commission has already issue a
      pre-procurement call for contractors to build this Do Not E-mail
      Database and operate that system on behalf of the
      Commission.[FTC-RFI] The Commission has solicited comments from
      the public on "practical, technical, security, privacy,
      enforceability and other concerns" with respect to establishment
      of such a registry.

   o  Section 6(I) of the DIARRUCA requests comments from the public on
      the use of an "ADV" label in the subject line of non-adult
      commercial messages and further inquires whether senders could add
      additional information such as "ADV:Automobiles."

   o  Additionally sec. 6(H)(3) and sec. (4) of the DIARRUCA request
      commentary on the issues of "analysis and recommendations
      concerning how to address commercial email that originates in or
      is transmitted through or to facilities or computers in other
      nations." and "options for protecting consumers, including
      children from the receipt and viewing of commercial email that is
      obscene or pornographic."

2. How to Submit Comments

   Congress thinks the Do-Not-Mail list is great. Senator Schumer calls
   the list the last hope for consumers. The Chairman of the FTC has
   said this is your basic Bad Idea.(TM) [CBS]

   To submit your comment electronically, go here:

      <http://www.regulations.gov/AGCY_FEDERALTRADECOMMISSION.cfm>

   You then have to scroll down to get to CAN-SPAM, then click on
   "Submit a Comment."  That leads you to a snazzy form to fill out.
   You can skip the survey if you want and enter your comments directly
   in the text area, or you can attach a document.

      Note: The author apologizes for not furnishing a direct link to
      the relevant proceeding.  That is actually a Feature(c) not a
      Bug(c) at <http://www.regulations.gov/>, the "e-gov" (sic)
      operation that the FTC outsources these functions to. There is no
      permanent URL for a given comment action and the search forms only
      support "method=POST".

      The reason for this appears to be because regulations.gov is
      further outsourcing the comment sub-function to facilities located
      on the other shore at CommentWorks(TM).com. Perhaps
      "regulations.gov" is taking the "customer" analogy a bit too far,
      attempting to force consumers through the front door so they view
      all the pretty merchandise available.  After all, somebody
      hurrying in to comment on some mundane trade regulation, might
      well succumb to an "impulse buy" and take the time to comment on a
      forthcoming environmental ruling.

   In your comments, make sure to identify who you are and why your
   comments are relevant.  For example:

   o  *Tell them who you are:* "I am the author of several Internet
      RFC's including [RFC1149], 'A Standard for the Transmission of IP
      Datagrams on Avian Carriers' which defines the fundamental
      characteristics used for electronic mail when transported over an
      infrastructure composed of avian carriers."

   o  *Tell them about any Bad Things(TM):* "I believe a centralized
      do-not-email registry poses a significant security and privacy
      threat to consumers. I do not believe that mechanisms such as
      SHA-1-based one-way hash will provide adequate security for a
      centralized database and the non-standard use of labels in
      messages violates some key assumptions about the mail architecture
      as detailed in [RFC2821] and [RFC2822]."

draft-malamud-diarruca-concerns    FTC DIARRUCA               March 2004


   o  *Tell them about any Good Things(TM):* "I believe a decentralized
      approach, such as that outlined in the IETF No-Soliciting Proposed
      Standard will provide greater benefit to consumers and provides a
      much better solution for the international environment in which
      electronic mail, particularly spam, functions."

   Needless to say, use the language you feel is appropriate to express
   the views you hold. Just remember, you are speaking to a
   non-technical audience which is under a full-court press from some
   very eager contractors and is very anxious to be shown to be "doing
   something" about the problem.

3. No-Soliciting in a Nutshell

   The No Soliciting SMTP Service Extension[No-Solicit], a Proposed
   Standard, is being advanced by the author as an alternative to
   centralized, non-standardized approaches such as the do-not-email
   list and the use of labels on the subject line of a message. The
   extension does the following:

   o  Anybody can define a solicitation class keywords and attach
      meaning to them. Solicitation class keywords begin with your
      domain name in reverse order, followed by a colon, followed by
      arbitrary text.  For example: "org.media:ADV:ADLT". Solicitation
      class keywords can be up to 1000 characters long although, as with
      many things in life, brevity is better.

   o  A "Solicitation:" header is defined, which is available to the
      sender of a message to insert a solicitation class keyword.

   o  The "received:" header may be used by an Message Transfer Agent
      (MTA) to insert solicitation class keywords while the message is
      in transit.

   o  The "MAIL FROM" command in SMTP and responses may include
      solicitation class keywords.

   o  As a message recipient, you can filter on solicitation class
      keywords at either your message reader or your MTA, taking actions
      you feel are appropriate.

   If the FTC wished to used this extension:

   o  They would define their solicitation class keywords.  For example:
      "gov.ftc:SEXUALLY-EXPLICIT-CONTENT".

   o  The FTC could still require a label on the subject line if they
      feel that is necessary as a visual clue or for political reasons.
      But, with this extension they have choices and could instead/also
      require that information to be present in the body of the message
      as part of the "Brown Bag" requirement adopted by the Congress.

   o  The FTC might require any sender of a particular class of mail to
      use a "Solicitation:" header with the appropriate solicitation
      class keyword inserted.

   o  The FTC might also require high-volume senders of a particular
      class of mail to use the SMTP service extension.

   o  The FTC could concentrate on enforcement of violations instead of

4. Background on the Centralized Do-Not-Email Registry

   Metaphors can be as powerful as a herd of cattle upwind in late
   spring, but inappropriate metaphors can tempt lawmakers into using
   policies as mismatched to the problems they are trying to solve as a
   NASA Metro Map.[Tufte]

   In response to a public perception of widespread abuses by the
   telemarketing industry, the U.S. Congress passed legislation
   requiring the FTC and FCC to coordinate the establishment of a
   do-not-call list.[NOCALL-LAW]  The FTC and FCC both issued
   regulations [NOCALL-FTC][NOCALL-FCC] and those regulations were
   upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals.[NOCALL-CASE]

   The do-not-call program proved to be immensely popular, drawing a
   record number of registrants.  Consumer surveys indicate that the
   program has been highly effective, reducing the number of unwanted
   calls dramatically.  For example, a poll by Harris Interactive showed
   that "more than half of all adults (57%) say they have signed up and
   most of these people say they have either received no telemarketing
   calls since then (25%) or far less than before (53%).[HARRIS]

   The analogy between one highly successful program, the Do-Not-Call
   list, and the pressing public concern over spam was just too easy to
   make.  If it works for telephone, why not for spam?

   The analogy is flawed.  The technologies are different. A simple
   illustration of the difference is the economics of what happens if
   the list gets out into the wild and some violator wishes to reach the
   people on the list. Assume a do-no-call list of 50 million numbers
   and an equivalent do-not-email list of electronic mail addresses:

   o  To reach the 50 million telephone consumers, a substantial
      investment in telemarketing equipment, personnel, and time is
      needed.  Even if the average amount of time to reach a consumer
      and attempt to conduct a transaction is just one minute, the
      do-not-call list would require 833,333 hours of personnel time and
      telecommunications charges.  At $5/hour for people that's
      $4,166,166 for labor.  At $0.05/minute for telecommunications,
      that's $2,500,000 in telephone charges. And, these are only the
      variable costs.

   o  In sharp contrast, reaching 50 million consumers by electronic
      mail can be done in minutes, requires no capital investment, and
      there are numerous service providers who will send mail at a cost
      of approximately $50 per million messages.  The variable costs for
      reaching everybody on the do-not-spam list is $2500, less than 1/
      5000th of the cost for the do-not-call list.

draft-malamud-diarruca-concerns    FTC DIARRUCA               March 2004


   The economics is simple: this is a large financial disincentive to
   violate the do-not-call list.  The returns would have to be very
   large to justify the risk.  Spamming the do-not-spam list, on the
   other hand, has a low entry cost, requires a neglible return, and has
   low risk.

   A do-not-email list would be impossible to secure.  The list must be
   consulted by all legitimate marketeers.  And, as we've seen with DVDs
   distributed to members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
   Sciences, distribution of secrets to a large population, no matter
   how august that population, is an inherently insecure activity.

   The FTC, as part of the rule-making process, has issued a "Request
   for Information" (RFI) [FTC-RFI] in which contractors no doubt
   expended significant energy responding how they would protect the
   security of such a database. Unfortunately, requests for copies of
   those proposals by prospective contractors have not been released for
   public scrutiny due to "concerns about proprietary information," so
   it is not possible to point out the security flaws in any specific
   proposal (but see Appendix A).

   In the RFI, the FTC expressed interest in a variety of proposals.
   The core do-not-email database was specified as having a capacity of
   300 million electronic mail messages, and vendors had to price out
   solutions of up to 450 million entries. Three of the variants
   solicited by the FTC are noteworthy:

   o  A list that only has domain names and not individual electronic
      mail addresses.  Such a list might work well for sophisticated
      users with their own domains, but would disenfranchise those users
      who use large Internet Service Providers such as Time Warner's AOL
      or Microsoft's MSN.

   o  A list that includes the addresses of telemarketers, flipping the
      onus to register from those who do not want email to those who
      sent the unwanted email.  While this idea may seem clever, just
      imagine the burden this places on millions of individual mail
      users who would have to download  the list frequently, and install
      mail filters to match each of the addresses.

   o  One idea that has caught the imagination of some members of the
      press is the proposal by UNSPAM(R), LLC (<http://www.unspam.com/
      >), which bills itself as the "the no-spam registry experts" who
      are "paving the way towards a spam-free future."  Their approach
      uses a one-way hash based on SHA-1.  Their schtick is that means
      you can't read the list, but can only use it to verify an email
      address.  There is a fundamental problem here.  Finding email
      addresses is easy: you can uses Google, build your own scraper,



Malamud                Expires September 22, 2004               [Page 9]

draft-malamud-diarruca-concerns    FTC DIARRUCA               March 2004


      buy a list, or do a dictionary attack.  The key to the global
      "spamonomy"--a term coined by noted author Danny Goodman in his
      forthcoming book analyzing spam, how it works, and how you can try
      to stop it[Goodman]--is verifying that an email address is real
      and active.  Wouldn't it be handy to have a single source you
      could use to scrub your lists to find out which addresses are
      valid?  This is a really Bad Idea(TM).

   We should note in passing that the RFI also includes provisions for
   charging consumers for the privilege of being included on the list.

   A do-not-email list is not practical to secure, nor is it practical
   to run.  It is a highly centralized solution requiring intense
   government supervision and large contracts to the private sector to
   operate the computers.

   Most importantly, the centralized database does not take into account
   our international world.   Most spam, even that originating from U.S.
   citizens, goes through facilities in many countries.  It is hard to
   imagine the European Union and the U.S. agreeing how to merge
   separate do-not-email databases to provide a unified solution, let
   alone agree on what privacy standards should be are posed by such a
   large collection of individual information aggregated in one place.

   In contrast, it is very possible to imagine both entities imposing
   labeling requirements that can coexist in a common header, much as
   food that crosses national boundary has labeling requirements imposed
   by multiple jurisdictions.

   Why should a private citizen have to register with the federal
   government in order to be left alone?  A large centralized database
   is a security threat, a privacy threat, and will do little to solve
   the problem.  In contrast, a decentralized solution stands a chance
   of being adopted by different jurisdictions and is flexible enough to
   handle the wide variety of people who use electronic mail.

   Finally, John Klensin has pointed out that even if the list was
   successful for the classes of mail it attempts to regulate, such a
   large volume of mail falls outside of those classes that any
   unilateral centralized solution is bound to fail:

      "It might perhaps also be worth pointing out that, unlike the
      pre-'do-not-call' telemarketing situation, there is a high volume
      of nuisance spam today, traffic that has no obvious commercial
      purpose, since it does not contain any solicitation in any
      characters or language that the recipient can read.  Whether that
      traffic is deliberate or accidental remains a matter of debate,
      but it almost all originates from offshore servers and would

      almost certainly be insensitive to 'do-not-email' lists."

5. Background on Labels

   Section 5(d) of the CAN-SPAM Act [CAN-SPAM] directs the FTC, within
   120 days of the promulgation of the act, to "prescribe ... clearly
   identifiable marks or notices to be included in or association with
   commercial e-mail that contains sexually explicit material."   In a
   notice of rulemaking on this subject,[FTC-PORN] the mechanism
   proposed for such identification would be the insertion of the phrase
   "SEXUALLY-EXPLICIT-CONTENT:" as "the first 27 letters in the subject
   line."

   In addition, in the DIARRUCA ANPR, the FTC solicited public comment
   on the use of "ADV", "ADV:ADLT" or similar marks in subject lines,
   which is the practice adopted by over a dozen state laws previous to
   the passage of the Can-Spam Act of 2003.

   Placing marks on the subject line is a visual clue for a human being,
   but unfortunately the process is highly error-prone for computers.
   Even with a human being, the process is ambiguous:

   o  For a computer, embedding a label in the subject line makes it
      extremely difficulty to reliably filter out unwanted mail. Even
      with a long label such as SEXUALLY-EXPLICIT-CONTENT, there will be
      collisions.  The problem is that the subject line is overloaded:
      it has to do several different things including the primary task
      which is conveying the subject of the message in the sender's own
      words.

   o  For a consumer, the label is ambiguous.  A long label can be
      confused with real content.  And, the definition of short labels
      are extremely overloaded.  For example, over a dozen states passed
      laws requiring "ADV" in the subject line.  Which definition of
      "ADV" should we think applies to this message?  And, what happens
      when, for example, Korea requires that the Han-gul equivalent be
      inserted at the beginning of a subject line?

   o  The purpose of a subject line is for a human being to enter words
      that convey the subject of the message.  Using this for
      machine-based filtering is silly.  A separate header makes much
      more sense.

   An added bonus of using a special "Solicitation:" header is that the
   same format for solicitation class keywords can be used on on the
   "received:" headers which are inserted by the Message Transfer Agent.
   So, if spammers ignore the law about putting in solicitation headers,
   perhaps your MTA can help compensate by inserting the missing
   information in a trace field.  Of course, it is up to you and your
   mail reader to decide if you trust that MTA's trace field and what

   actions to take.

   Littering our mail headers with ad-hoc solutions destroys the
   integrity of the mail system.  A more systematic solution will be
   both more flexible and more effective.

Appendix A. FOIA Request for Responses to Do-Not-Email Contractor
            Solicitations

   This FOIA request was submitted at [Wed Mar 17 14:10:25 PST 2004] to
   [2].

   March 21, 2004

   Freedom of Information Act Request
   Office of General Counsel
   Federal Trade Commission
   600 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.
   Washington, D.C. 20580

   Dear Sir/Madam:

   This is a request under the Freedom of Information Act. I request
   that a copy of the following document(s) be provided to me: Copies of
   documents submitted in response to the February 23, 2004 Request For
   Information: Federal Trade Commission's Plan for Establishing a
   National Do Not E-mail Registry. The responses were sent to the
   attention of Mr. Daniel Salsburg, Federal Trade Commission, Division
   of Marketing Practices, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue N.W., Washington,
   D.C. 20580.

   In order to help determine fees, you should know that I am an
   individual.

   I am willing to pay fees up to $200. If you expect the fees will
   exceed this, please contact me before proceeding.

   I request a waiver of all fees for this request. Disclosure of the
   requested information to me is in the public interest because it is
   likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the
   operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in my
   commercial interest.   Specifically, a national do-not-email registry
   is a matter of national policy and any proposed contractor-based
   implementations of such a registry raise numerous issues that the
   public should be able to examine, particularly in order to be able to
   submit comments requested by the FTC as part of the Advance Notice of
   Proposed Rulemaking, Project No. R411008, Definitions,
   Implementation, and Reporting Requirements Under the CAN-SPAM Act.

   If you need to discuss this request, I can be reached at at [3].

   Thank you for your consideration of my request.

   Sincerely,



Malamud                Expires September 22, 2004              [Page 17]
