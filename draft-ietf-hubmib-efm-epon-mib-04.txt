1.2.  EPON architecture highlights

1.2.1.  Introduction

   The EPON standard, as defined in [802.3ah], is defining the Layer 1
   (Physical media) and layer 2 (media access) interfaces for the
   Ethernet passive optical networks.  The EPON is a Gigabit Ethernet
   protocol for the Optical Access based on passive optical splitting
   (PON) topology.  A Passive Optical Network (PON) is a single, shared
   optical fiber that uses optical passive splitters to divide the
   single fiber into separate subscribers.

   Server unit - Optical Line Terminal (OLT).  The equipment at the CO.

   Client Unit - Optical Network Unit (ONU).  The equipment at the CPE.

   Standard is IEEE802.3ah.

   The following diagram describes the PON topology:

               one or more P2MP

               -------        \ etc





   The architecture positioning is defined in the [802.3ah] Figure 56.2
   diagram.  The [802.3ah] defines the following clauses for the network
   operation.

   Clause 30 - management

   Clause 60 - PMD for the EPON media (Burst PMD)

   Clause 64 - MPCP (Multipoint control protocol) - defines the media
   access for the operation of the multipoint architecture of the EPON.

   Clause 65 -

   a) Virtual links for the EPON

   b) FEC

   c) PMA for the EPON.

1.2.2.  Principles of operation

   The EPON protocol is based on the gigabit Ethernet protocol of the
   IEEE as described in [802.3ah] clause 35 and 36.  The interface to
   the MAC is through the GMII I/F as described in clause 35 and the PCS
   layer is based on the gigabit Ethernet clause 36.  The MPCP is placed
   in the MAC control layer.  The Emulation layer, located at the RS
   (Reconciliation Sublayer), creates virtual private path to each ONU
   and the FEC enhances reach and split performance.

1.2.3.  The physical media

   Uplink and downlink are multiplexed using separated wavelengths on
   the same fiber.  The Downlink is a broadcast media where the OLT
   transmits the data to all ONUs.  The uplink is a shared transmission
   media for all of the ONUs.  The uplink multiplexing access is based
   on time division (TDM) and the management of the TDM access is
   defined in the Multi-Point control protocol (MPCP).  The upstream
   collisions are avoided through the transmission coordination done by
   the MPCP protocol.  The transmission is of one ONU at a time.  The
   OLT send control messages (GATE messages) allowing ONUs to transmit,

   defining when the transmission occurs and what is its duration.
   These messages define the transmission order and the amount of BW for
   each ONU.  A scheduling algorithm at the OLT, which is not defined,
   in the [802.3ah] is responsible to divide the BW and control the
   delay of each ONU according to its SLA.

1.2.4.  PMD specifications

   The same wavelength optical plan as ITU-T G.983 is selected.  The
   transceivers are derivations from existing Ethernet optics
   transceivers.  What is added is the burst functionality for the
   uplink - burst transmission at the ONU and burst reception at the
   OLT.  The [802.3ah] selected very relaxed burst parameters.

1.2.5.  Point to point emulation

   An emulated point-to-point link is created for each ONU.  The
   downstream transmission is an aggregation of point-to-point tunnels
   and single-copy-broadcast channel (tagged as all ones LLID).  The
   ONUa filter traffic not intended for their reception according to the
   virtual link marking.  An LLID tag is attached at the preamble to
   denote the virtual link - destination at the downstream and source at
   the upstream.

   The virtual links concept is also used to avoid violations of
   bridging rules for peer to peer traffic in the PON.  A bridge sees a
   single MAC Client for every link pair.  The private paths concept
   means no networking problems exist and it provides subscriber
   isolation.  As the tunneling is only virtual there is a single
   physical interface and a single physical layer for the device
   including attributes like local MAC address.  The following diagram
   describes the virtual tunneling for the EPON.

1.2.6.  MPCP principles

   The OLT, which is the server unit, manages the network.  The MPCP
   controls the TDM transmission of the uplink.  The MPCP is implemented
   at the MAC control layer and the MPCP messages are MAC control
   messages using the 8808 Ethertype.  These messages are not forwarded
   from the MAC.  A concept of time must exist in the protocol in order
   to schedule the uplink transmission.  The synchronized timestamp in
   the network is managed through the MPCP messages.  The timestamp is
   also used to measure the RTT of each ONU and compensate it for
   transmission.  The difference of incoming timestamp to local time
   allows OLT to calculate the RTT.  The TDM control is done using the
   gate messages.  These messages define for each ONU the time for
   transmission and the length of transmission.  The RTT is reduced from
   the transmission time at the gate message to shift the ONU

   transmission time in the opposite direction.

   A scheduling algorithm at the OLT, which is not defined in the
   [802.3ah], is responsible to divide the BW and control the
   transmission delay of each ONU according to its SLA.  In order for
   this algorithm to be efficient a closed loop operation is enabled
   meaning.  The closed loop is achieved by that the ONU reports on the
   amount of BW it require for transmission.  This allows to allocate
   different peak BW for each ONU at different times using the
   statistical properties of the traffic hence allowing oversubscription
   of the BW.  The messages are for the BW report are denoted as REPORT
   messages which report the amount of data in the ONU queues.  In
   addition to that the MPCP defines a protocol of auto-discovery and
   registration of ONUs.

   The registration process is defined in the diagram below:

   special discovery grant allocated for that by the OLT.  During that
   time more than one ONU might try to register and as the RTT of the
   new ONUs is not known yet a collision in transmission might occur.  A
   random backoff mechanism of transmission is used to schedule the next
   registration requests to avoid these collisions.  When the OLT
   receives REG_REQUEST message of an ONU and approves this ONU then it
   sends a REGISTER message to this ONU defining its LLID.  From this
   time the ONU transmission is scheduled by its LLID, knowing the RTT,
   and no collision can occur.  The ONU replies with a REGISTER_ACK
   message and the registration process of the MPCP ends.  Higher layer
   protocols may yet be needed to authenticate the ONU and allow it to
   participate in the network.

1.2.7.  Forward Error correction (FEC)

   The FEC is defined to enhance the link budget of the PON.  As each
   splitter attenuates the optical signal, the number of the splits and
   the distance are limited by the link budget and hence an FEC which
   improves the link budget is very useful.  The FEC code used is the
   RS(239,255,8), similar to G.975 improving the BER from 1E-4 to 1E-12.

   The FEC parity encapsulation is based on the Ethernet frames.  The
   Ethernet frames are spaced by rate adaptation, and the parity bytes
   are inserted in the provided space.

   As the start and end of frame signals are outside of the FEC
   protection, they are replaced by a series of symbols to enhance their
   vulnerability to errors.

   The following diagram presents an FEC protected frame:

   |       |              |           |     |       |          |       |
   | S_FEC | Preamble/SFD |   Frame   | FCS | T_FEC |  Parity  | T_FEC |

   +-------------------------------------------------------------------+



   The FEC layer introduces a fixed delay in the receive and transmit
   path.

   The FEC layer is optional.

1.3.  Management architecture

   Each one of the EPON layers is accompanied by a management I/F, which
   is controlled through clause 30 of the spec.  The MIB document
   allocates for each one of them a separate package, as the [802.3ah]
   spec may be used for different applications and may use some of the
   clauses separately.

   The following diagram presents the packages relation to IEEE layering

   As for the ONU the situation is simple.  There is one logical and
   physical interface and a single copy exists for each layer which can
   be remotely queried by the OLT.

   At the OLT there is a single physical interface and N virtual logical
   interfaces for the virtual links of the ONUs ( and another virtual
   interface for the broadcast virtual link).  As can be seen from the
   layering diagram above, the MAC is virtually duplicated and therefore
   the selection for the management for this scenario is to allocate an
   interface index for each one of the virtual link and an additional
   interface index for the OLT.  Therefore the Interface, MAU and
   etherLike interfaces MIBs have a row (ifIndex) for each virtual link
   at the OLT.  The justification for this partition is that the
   interfaces are quite well separated as they present physical
   different ONUs which are viewed from the OLT point of view, and for
   instance there is a meaning for a separate bad frames, or bad octets
   counters for each virtual link as the ONUs can be distanced
   differently, which is quite similar to a separate physical interface.
   The same partition concept exists for the MIB module of this
   document.  Each row in the tables is selected according to the
   ifIndex and specifically there is a row for each virtual link.  There
   are a few control objects which are defined for the entire layer (and
   they should have the same value for each ifIndex) but most of the
   objects are partitioned into N+1 logical interfaces at the OLT for
   each layer.  It is a bit different than the IEEE layering diagram
   which present the P2MP layer as a single layer while duplicating the
   MAC and MAC client layers (Please see the diagram above).  However
   from management perspective it is more convenient and neat to
   partition the management of the entities for the virtual links as the
   managed atomic entity is the virtual link, and use the interface
   index for that purpose as it is already used for the rows of the
   virtual links at the Interface, MAU and etherLike interfaces MIBs.

   As an example provided below are the values for the MPCP control
   table for an OLT with 3 ONUs registered:

2.  MIB structure

   This document defines the DOT3 EPON MIB module.  The DOT3 EPON MIB
   module defines the objects used for configuration and description of
   the [802.3ah] Point to Multipoint (P2MP) section.  These MIB module
   objects are included in four MIB module groups.

   The Multi-Point Control Protocol (MPCP) MIB objects - MIB objects
   related to [802.3ah] clause 64 Multi Point Control Protocol
   attributes.  In this MIB module group: The dot3MpcpControlTable
   defines the objects used for the configuration and status indication,
   which are per logical link, of MPCP layer ([802.3ah] Multi-Point
   Control Protocol) compliant interfaces.  The dot3MpcpStatTable
   defines the statistics objects, which are per logical link, for MPCP
   compliant interfaces.

   The OMPEmulation MIB objects - MIB module related to [802.3ah] clause
   65 point to point emulation attributes.  In this MIB module group:
   The dot3OmpEmulationTable defines the objects used for the
   configurations and status indications which are per logical link, of
   OMPEmulation compliant interfaces.  The dot3OmpEmulationStatTable
   defines the statistics objects, which are per logical link, for
   OMPEmulation compliant interfaces.

   The FEC MIB module objects - managed object related to [802.3ah]
   clause 60 and clause 65 EPON FEC attributes.  The dot3EponFecTable
   defines the objects used for the configurations and status
   indications, which are per logical link, of FEC EPON compliant
   interfaces.


   The EPON extended package MIB objects defining the objects used for
   configuration and description of management objects for extended
   capabilities of the EPON interfaces.  The dot3ExtPkgControlTable
   defines the extended package objects, which are per logical link,
   used for the configuration and status indication of the EPON
   interfaces.  The dot3ExtPkgQueueTable defines the extended package
   objects, which are per logical link, and per REPORT queue used for
   the configuration and status indication of the ONU queues reported at
   the MPCP REPORT message of the EPON interfaces.  The
   dot3ExtPkgQueueSetsTable defines the extended package objects, which
   are per logical link per REPORT queue, and per queue_set used for the
   configuration and status indication of the ONU queue_sets reported at
   the MPCP REPORT message of the EPON interfaces.  The
   dot3ExtPkgOptIfTable defines the extended package objects, which are
   per logical link, used for the control and status indication of the
   optical interfaces of the EPON interfaces.

3.  Relation to other MIB Modules

3.1.  Relation to the Interfaces MIB and Ethernet-like Interfaces MIB

   EPON interfaces are a type of Ether-like interface.  This module
   extends the objects of the Ehter-like interfaces management for the
   EPON type interfaces.  Thus, each managed EPON interface would have a
   corresponding entry in the mandatory tables of the Ether-like MIB
   module found in [RFC3635], and likewise in the tables from the
   Interface MIB module found in [RFC2863].  Also each managed virtual
   EPON interface defined by the virtual link at the OLT would have a
   corresponding entry in the mandatory tables of the Ether-like MIB
   module found in [RFC3635], and likewise in the tables from the
   Interface MIB module found in [RFC2863] with a dedicated ifIndex.

   There is no replication of the objects from these RFCs, so for
   instance the document is defining dot3MpcpRemoteMACAddress only while
   assuming the local MAC address attribute is already defined in
   [RFC3635]

   Interface Indexes as specified in [RFC2863] are used in these MIB
   Modules.  The descriptions of the ifIndexes denote which ifIndex is
   being used.  The use of ifIndex is for actual existing connections
   and for the virtual links at the OLT.  The OLT interface and the
   virtual link interfaces are stacked using the ifStack table specified
   at [RFC2863] and the ifInvStack defined in [RFC2864].  At the OLT the
   OLT interface and the virtual links associated with it are stacked as
   the OLT interface is the higher layer of all other interfaces related
   to the virtual links.

   In this MIB module the interface referred to is the OLT interface and
   the sub-layers defined in the [802.3ah] for the OLT are also divided
   into virtual links.  Therefore the ifIndexs used in the MIB document
   for the OLT are the ifIndex of the OLT and the ifIndexes of the
   virtual links.  Information for each LLID in the tables is indexed by
   the interface index for each table.  This index is corresponding to
   the virtual link interfaces ifIndexs.

   Only the MAC address at the OLT is not duplicated as the physical
   interface is the same.  It is specified in the [802.3ah] section
   64.1.2.  At the tables this entry is duplicated for the virtual
   interfaces.

   Implementing this module therefore MUST require implementation of
   Interfaces MIB module [RFC2863] and Ethernet-like Interfaces MIB
   module [RFC3635].

   As an example here are the values for the Interface MIB for an OLT

                                  Table 7

   As specified above the creation of the rows at the ONU and at the
   OLT, for the OLT interface and for the broadcast virtual index, is
   done at initialization.  The creation and deletion of rows for the
   virtual links is done when the virtual link is established (ONU
   registers) and when the virtual link is deleted (ONU deregisters).

3.2.  Relation to the IEEE 802.3 MAU MIBs

   In the amended MAU MIB document the MAU types of the EPON Interfaces
   is defined.  This document assumes the implementation of the MAU MIB
   for this purpose and does not repeat the EPON MAU types.  Therefore
   implementing this module MUST require implementation of MAU-MIB
   module [RFC3636].  For the ONU there is a single row for the
   ifMauTable.  At the OLT there is a row for each virtual link (N+1),
   ifMauIfIndex has a value for each virtual link.

   As specified above the creation of the rows at the ONU and at the OLT
   for the OLT interface and for the broadcast virtual index, is done at
   initialization.  The creation and deletion of rows for the virtual
   links is done when the virtual link is established (ONU registers)
   and when the virtual link is deleted (ONU deregisters).

3.3.  Relation to the EFM OAM MIB

   The EPON interfaces are aimed to the access optical networks and most
   probably will be followed by implementation of the OAM section of the
   [802.3ah].  Therefore The EFM OAM MIB module [I-D.ietf-hubmib-efm-
   mib] MAY be implemented defining attributes and managed objects that
   are complementary to the EFM EPON MIB module.  As the OAM is defined
   for a point to point link it is implemented using the virtual links
   which are defined for the P2MP network, so that an instance is held
   for each Logical link (LLID) of the EPON.  The respective ifIndex of
   the virtual link is used as the ifIndex of the OAM MIB for this
   purpose.

3.4.  Relation to the bridge MIB

   It is very probable that an EPON OLT will implement a bridging
   functionality above the EPON interface layer, bridging between the
   EPON users and the network.  In this scenario the virtual ports of
   the EPON are corresponding to the virtual bridge ports.  There is a
   direct mapping between the bridge ports and the LLIDs, which are
   virtual EPON channels.

   If the OLT supports bridging then the virtual physical interfaces are
   the bridge virtual ports.  The values for dot1dBasePortIfIndex would
   be the number of the ifIndex for the virtual port (1 for LLID1, 2 for
   LLID2,...)

   The bridge MIB modules [RFC4188], [RFC1525] MAY be implemented in
   this case where the objects of the bridge MIB module are used
   accordingly.

       STATUS  current
       DESCRIPTION
               "A table for extended package Queue management objects.
                The [802.3ah] MPCP uses for the feedback BW request from
                the ONUs a report of some queues occupancy. These queues
                serve the ONU transmission and data is gathered there
                until the ONU is granted for transmission. Since the
                existence of such queuing mechanism is implied in the
                [802.3ah] spec and an ONU may not be a switch device,
                a management section is added here for the queues,
                mainly to gather some statistics of their operation.
                Entries are control and status indication
                objects for an EPON interface which are gathered in an
                extended package as an addition for the [802.3ah]
                attributes. The objects in this table are specific for
                the queues which are reported in the MPCP REPORT message
                as defined in [802.3ah] clause 64.
                Each object has a row for every virtual link and for
                every queue in the report. Typically the number of
                expected virtual link in a PON is like the number of
                ONUs 32-64 plus an additional entry for broadcast LLID
                (which is marked by 0xffff). In the [802.3ah] the LLID
                is a 2bytes register and the number of LLIDs limited by
                that.
                The number of queues is between 0 and 7 and limited by

6.  IANA Considerations

   The DOT3 EPON MIB module requires the allocation of a single object
   identifier for its MODULE-IDENTITY under the MIB-2 tree.

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:




         Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
         ----------        -----------------------

         dot3EponMIB        { mib-2 XXX }


   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
   requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and
   to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  When the
   assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXX"
   (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove
   this note.

7.  Security Considerations

   There are number of managed objects defined in this MIB module that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write or read-create.  Writing to
   these objects can have potentially disruptive effects on network
   operation: Including:

   Changing dot3MpcpAdminState state (Writing can be done at any time)

   Changing dot3EponFecMode mode (Writing can be done at any time)

   Changing dot3ExtPkgObjectReset mode (Writing can be done at any time)

   Changing dot3ExtPkgObjectFecEnabled mode (Writing can be done at any
   time)

   Changing dot3ExtPkgObjectPowerDown (Writing can be done at any time)

   Changing dot3ExtPkgObjectReportNumThreshold (Writing can be done at
   any time)

   Changing dot3ExtPkgObjectReportThreshold (Writing can be done at any
   time)

   Changing dot3ExtPkgObjectRegisterAction (Writing can be done at any
   time)

   Changing dot3ExtPkgRMadlEntryStatus (Writing can be done at any time)

   Changing dot3ExtPkgOptIfLowerInputPowerThreshold (Writing can be done
   at any time)

   Changing dot3ExtPkgOptIfUpperInputPowerThreshold (Writing can be done
   at any time)

   Changing dot3ExtPkgOptIfLowerOutputPowerThreshold (Writing can be
   done at any time)

   Changing dot3ExtPkgOptIfUpperOutputPowerThreshold (Writing can be
   done at any time)

   Changing dot3ExtPkgOptIfTransmitEnable (Writing can be done at any
   time)


   The user of this MIB module must therefore be aware that support for
   SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper protection
   can have a negative effect on network operations.

   The readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., those with MAX-ACCESS
   other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive in some
   environments since, collectively, they provide information about the
   performance of network interfaces and can reveal some aspects of
   their configuration.  In such environments it is important to control
   even GET and NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly even to
   encrypt their values when sending them over the network via SNMP.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
