1.  Introduction

   For much of the history of the RFC Series, the character encoding
   used has been US-ASCII [ASCII].  This was a sensible choice at the
   time: the language of the Series is English, a language which only
   uses US-ASCII-encoded characters (ignoring for a moment words
   borrowed from more richly decorated alphabets).  US-ASCII is the
   "lowest common denominator" for character encoding, making cross-
   platform viewing trivial.

   There are limits to US-ASCII, however, which hinder its continued use
   as the exclusive character encoding for the Series.  The increasing
   need for easily readable, internationalized content suggests it is
   time to allow non-ASCII characters in RFCs where necessary.  Given
   the continuing goal of maximum readability across platforms, the use
   of non-ASCII should not be gratuitous in a document.  This RFC
   describes the rules under which non-ASCII characters may be used in
   an RFC.  These rules will be applied as the necessary changes are
   made to submission checking and editorial tools.

2.  Basic requirements

   Three fundamental requirements inform the guidance and examples
   provided in this document.  They are:

   o  Searches of an index need to be able to find multiple ways of
      writing an author's name;

   o  People whose system does not have the fonts needed to display a
      particular RFC need to be able to read the non-canonical HTML,
      text, or PDF RFC correctly.

3.  Rules for the use of non-ASCII characters

3.1.  General usage throughout a document

   The mention, as opposed to the use, of non-ASCII characters requires
   the use of Unicode identifiers.  Including non-ASCII characters in
   the text is encouraged to make the mention clearer to readers with
   devices that can render the non-ASCII text.  Including Unicode
   character names is allowed.

   The distinction is between an occasion in which a word appears in a
   sentence in order to convey the meaning of that word (use), and an
   occasion in which a word appears in order to make some point about
   that word itself (mention).

   Spelling for words commonly used in the English language will follow
   the guidance in the Mirriam-Webster dictionary.  Other uses,
   including archaic or untraditional spellings, are not allowed.

   Example:

   Use:

    SIP/2.0 200 = 2**3 * 5**2 &#1085;&#1086; &#1089;&#1090;&#1086; &#1076;&#1077;&#1074;&#1103;&#1085;&#1086;&#1089;&#1090;&#1086; &#1076;&#1077;&#1074;&#1103;&#1090;&#1100; - &#1087;&#1088;&#1086;&#1089;&#1090;&#1086;&#1077;
    Via: SIP/2.0/UDP 192.0.2.198;branch=z9hG4bK1324923
    Call-ID: unreason.1234ksdfak3j2erwedfsASdf
    CSeq: 35 INVITE
    From: sip:user@example.com;tag=11141343
    To: sip:user@example.edu;tag=2229
    Content-Length: 154
    Content-Type: application/sdp

   Mention:

    For example, the characters "&#5082;&#5026;&#5045;&#5036;&#5026;&#5036;&#5074;" (U+13DA U+13A2 U+13B5
    U+13AC U+13A2 U+13AC U+13D2) from the Cherokee block look
    similar to the ASCII characters "STPETER" as they might look
    when presented using a "creative" font family.

3.2.  Author Names

   Valid Unicode is required, and for non-ASCII names, an ASCII-only
   identifier is required.

   Cat Enterprises BCP: 33 D. van Gulik Category: Best Current Practice
   ISIS/CEO, JRC Ispra R. Iannella DSTC Pty Ltd P. Faeltstroem (P.
   Faltstrom) Tele2/Swipnet June 1999

   Example for the Acknowledgements: OLD: The following people
   contributed significant text to early versions of this draft: Patrik
   Faltstrom, William Chan, and Fred Baker.

    PROPOSED/NEW:
    The following people contributed significant text to early
    versions of this draft: Patrik Faeltstroem (Patrik Faltstrom),
    &#38472;&#26234;&#26124; (William Chan), and Fred Baker.

3.3.  Body of the document

   Non-ASCII characters may be used only where necessary to clearly
   express the intended meaning of the text.  When such characters are
   mentioned in the text, the following rules apply:

   o  Non-ASCII characters will require identifying the codepoint (e.g.
      U+0394)

   o  Use of the actual UTF-8 character (e.g., &#916;) is encouraged so
      that a reader can more easily see what the character is, if their
      device can render the text.

   o  If preferred by the author(s), the use of the official character
      names like "Greek Capital Letter Delta" is allowed.

   Examples:

       OLD (draft-ietf-precis-framework):
       However, the problem is made more serious by introducing the
       full range of Unicode code points into protocol strings. For
       example, the characters U+13DA U+13A2 U+13B5 U+13AC U+13A2
       U+13AC U+13D2 from the Cherokee block look similar to the
       ASCII characters "STPETER" as they might look when presented
       using a "creative" font family.

       NEW/ALLOWED:
       However, the problem is made more serious by introducing the
       full range of Unicode code points into protocol strings. For

Internet-Draft               Non-ASCII RFCs                February 2014


       example, the characters U+13DA U+13A2 U+13B5 U+13AC U+13A2
       U+13AC U+13D2 (&#5082;&#5026;&#5045;&#5036;&#5026;&#5036;&#5074;) from the Cherokee block look similar
       to the ASCII characters "STPETER" as they might look when
       presented using a "creative" font family.

       ALSO ACCEPTABLE:
       However, the problem is made more serious by introducing the
       full range of Unicode code points into protocol strings. For
       example, the characters "&#5082;&#5026;&#5045;&#5036;&#5026;&#5036;&#5074;" (U+13DA U+13A2 U+13B5 U+13AC
       U+13A2 U+13AC U+13D2) from the Cherokee block look similar to
       the ASCII characters "STPETER" as they might look when
       presented using a "creative" font family.

3.4.  Tables

   Tables follow the same rules for identifiers and characters as the
   body.  If it is sensible (i.e., more understandable for a reader) for
   a given document to have two tables, one including the identifiers
   and characters, one with just the characters, that will be allowed on
   a case by case basis.

   Example: TBD

3.5.  Code components

   Use the U+ notation except within a code component where you must
   follow the rules of the programming language in which you are writing
   the code

   Example:

   TBD

3.6.  Bibliographic text

   The reference entry must be in English; whatever subfields are
   present must be available in ASCII.  As long as good sense is used,
   they may also include non-ASCII characters at author discretion.
   This applies to both normative and informative references.

   Example: [GOST3410]  "Information technology.  Cryptographic data
   security.  Signature and verification processes of [electronic]
   digital signature.", GOST R 34.10-2001, Gosudarstvennyi Standard of
   Russian Federation, Government Committee of Russia for Standards,
   2001.  (In Russian)

3.7.  Keywords

   Keywords must be US-ASCII only.

4.  Normalization Forms

   If the normalization matters to the content, the authors must submit
   in a normalization-resistant form.  In other words, authors should
   not expect normalization forms to be preserved.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.
