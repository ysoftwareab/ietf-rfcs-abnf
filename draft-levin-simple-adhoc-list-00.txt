Abstract

   This document presents an extension to the Session Initiation
   Protocol (SIP)-Specific Event Notification mechanism for subscribing
   to a homogeneous list of resources.  Instead of the subscriber
   sending a SUBSCRIBE for each resource individually, the subscriber
   can define an ad-hoc resource list, subscribe to it, and maintain it
   û all within a single SUBSCRIBE dialog. Changes in the state of the
   resources are reported using the same dialog in any standard SIMPLE
   format for conveying notifications for lists of resources or
   individual resources and agreed during the SUBSCRIBE dialog
   establishment.

Internet-Draft    Ad-hoc Resource Lists using SUBSCRIBE         Oct 2003


1. Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [2].

   This document uses the Resource List Server (RLS) definition from
   [8].

2. Introduction

   This document presents an extension to the Session Initiation
   Protocol (SIP)-Specific Event Notification mechanism for subscribing
   to a homogeneous list of resources.  Instead of the subscriber
   sending a SUBSCRIBE for each resource individually, the subscriber
   can define an ad-hoc resource list, subscribe to it, and maintain it
   û all within a single SUBSCRIBE dialog. Changes in the state of the
   resources are reported using the same dialog in any standard SIMPLE
   format for conveying notifications for lists of resources (such as
   [8] and [9]) or individual resources (such as [6]) and agreed during
   the SUBSCRIBE dialog establishment.

   This document defines a new XML schema for creation and maintenance
   of a homogeneous list of resources and a new SIP option tag for
   expressing support for this schema.

3. Overview of Operation

   Before using the ad-hoc list subscription, a subscriber needs to know
   that the RLS supports this mode of operation. In order to do so, the
   subscriber SHOULD issue OPTIONS request and ensure that the SIP
   "adhoclist" option tag is included in the RLS response.

   Once the subscriber knows that the RLS supports ad-hoc list
   operations, a Require header MUST be set to "adhoclist" and an
   initial resources list can be included in the SUBSCRIBE.

   It is the responsibility of the subscriber to create the list name.
   The value in the Request URI of SUBSCRIBE together with the list
   "name" MUST uniquely identify the list.

   Note that the exact notification mechanism and the notifications'
   format is negotiated by including appropriate SIP option tags in the
   Accept headers of SUBSCRIBE and corresponding Responses.

   The RLS MUST store and maintain the ad-hoc list for the life of the
   SUBSCRIBE dialog. The subscriber MAY update the list by using the
   defined add, delete, and reset operations. "Reset" operation means

   that the list MUST be emptied (and created using the new context if
   included).

   When a resource is added to /deleted from the list, the RLS SHOULD
   generate a NOTIFY as if the list had been updated by any possible
   out-of-band means and in accordance with the notification mechanism
   and format established for this list. The updated information SHOULD
   be sent to all the parties being subscribed to this list (including
   the "list-owner").

4. XML Schema

4.1 Formal Definition

   The schema for the adrl+xml XML document is given below.

      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
      <xs:schema targetNamespace="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:adrl"
                 elementFormDefault="qualified"

            <xs:sequence>
              <xs:element ref="list" minOccurs="0"
                          maxOccurs="unbounded" />
            </xs:sequence>

        </xs:element>

4.2 Example

   The example shows an update on Ann's ad-hoc list of friends: three
   friends are added to the list and one is deleted.

      <?xml version="1.0"?>
      <adhoclists xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:adrl" version="5">

        <list name="My Friends" uri="sip:ann@example.com">
          <resource vera@examle.com>
          <resource donna@examle.com>
          <resource calvin@examle.com>
        </list>

        <list name="My Friends" uri="sip:ann@example.com" action="delete">
          <resource ralph@examle.com>
        </list>

      </adhoclists>

   security risks beyond described in [7] for subscription to a single
   resource. Note that security considerations related to conveying
   resources' information using NOTIFYs are addressed by corresponding
   drafts (e.g. [8], [9], and [6]).

6. IANA Considerations

6.1 New SIP Option Tag: adhoclist

   This section defines a new option tag for the registry established by
   section 27.1 of RFC 3261[1].

   Option Tag Name: adhoclist

   Description: Extension to allow creation of and subscription to lists
   of resources

   Published specification: RFC xxxx [[Note to RFC editor: replace xxxx
   with the RFC number of this document when published]]

6.2 New MIME type for Resource List Meta-Information

   MIME Media Type Name: application

   MIME subtype name: adrl+xml

   Required parameters: None

   Optional parameters: charset

   See RFC 3023 [12] for a discussion of the charset parameter on
   XML-derived MIME types.  Since this MIME type is used exclusively in
   SIP, the use of UTF-8 encoding is strongly encouraged.

   Encoding considerations: 8-bit text

   Security considerations: Security considerations specific to uses of
   this MIME type are discussed in RFC xxxx [[Note to RFC editor:
   replace xxxx with the RFC number of this document when published]].
   RFC-1874 [4] and RFC-3023 [5] discuss security issues common to all
   uses of XML.

   Interoperability considerations: The use of this MIME body is
   intended to be generally interoperable.  No unique considerations
   have been identified.

   Published specification: RFC xxxx [[Note to RFC editor: replace xxxx
   with the RFC number of this document when published]]

Internet-Draft    Ad-hoc Resource Lists using SUBSCRIBE         Oct 2003


   Applications which use this media type: This media type is used to
   convey meta-information for the state of lists of resources within a
   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) subscription.

   Additional information:

   Magic Number(s): None.

   File Extension(s): None.

   Macintosh File Type Code(s): None.

   Object Identifier(s) or OID(s): None.

   Intended usage: Limited Use

   Other Information/General Comment: None.

6.3 URN Sub-Namespace

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:adrl

   Description: This is the XML namespace URI for XML elements defined
   by [RFCXXXX] to describe identifiers of resources when the
   information about such resources is aggregated within a single SIP
   subscription.  It is used in the application/adrl+xml body type.
