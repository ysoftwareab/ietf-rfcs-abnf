Abstract

   This memo describes a standard way to store traceroute measurements
   and possibly their related metrics.  To better address the traceroute
   measurements storing issue, the authors first of all give a
   definition of the traceroute tool, describe the tool itself as well
   as its parameters and the default values on the most common operating
   systems and the output results that can be stored.  Afterwards, the

   common information model with the base elements of the traceroute
   measurement storing is defined dividing the information elements in
   two semantically separated groups (configuration elements and results
   ones).  On the basis of the information model a data model is then
   proposed in order to actually store the traceroute measurements.
   Finally the relevant metrics related to traceroute measurements are
   defined using the metrics already standardized in the IPPM working
   group, where they are found to be applicables.

1.  Introduction

   Traceroutes are being used by lots of measurement efforts, either as
   an independent measurement or to get path information to support
   other measurement efforts.  That is why there is the need to
   standardize the way traceroute measurements are stored and the
   related metrics associated with such measurements.  Since traceroute
   is a tool that has built-in configurable mechanisms like time-outs
   and can experience problems related to the crossing of firewalls thus
   experiencing fake losses or incomplete delay information, the
   standard metrics defined by IPPM working group in matter of delay,
   connectivity and losses may not be complete enough to define
   univocally the metrics retrieved by the traceroute tool.  In such a
   context, already standardized metrics have to be closely examined in
   order to check for their applicability.  Moreover there is a need to
   better define the traceroute tool as well as its parameters and the
   results it outputs since, to the authors' knowledge, there is so far
   no standard describing these.  These are the motivations that moved
   the authors to write this draft in the context of the IPPM working
   group even if other working groups (like DISMAN) have already
   addressed similar issues related to the definition of the MIB for
   configuring and retrieving traceroute measurements results.  The rest
   of the draft is organised as follows: Section 2 gives the definition
   of traceroute used as reference in the rest of the draft as well as
   the traceroute configurable parameters and their default values for
   the most common operating systems.  Section 3 reports on both known
   problems of traceroute and existing alternatives.  Section 4
   describes the results available from the traceroute output screen.
   Section 5 and Section 6 respectively describe our proposed
   Information model and Data model for storing traceroute measurments.
   Section 7 reports on the proposed relevant metrics while Section 8
   gives our conclusions.  The draft ends with security considerations
   and open issues in Section 9 and Section 10 respectively.

2.  Definition of traceroute

   Traceroute is a network diagnostic tool used to determine the hop by
   hop path from a source to a destination and the Round Trip Time (RTT)
   from the source to each hop.  Traceroute can therefore be used to
   discover where and how a host is connected to the Internet and can be
   usefully employed to troubleshoot network connections.

   Typically, traceroute attemps to discover the path to a destination
   by sending UDP probes with specific time-to-live (TTL) values in the
   IP packet header and trying to elicit an ICMP TIME_EXCEEDED response
   from each gateway along the path to some host.

   More in detail, the host running the traceroute sends the first set
   of probes with TTL equal to one (some implementations allow setting
   the initial TTL to a value equal to "n" different from one, so that
   the first "n-1" hops are skipped and the first hop that will be
   traced is the "n-th" in the path).  Upon receiving a probe, the first
   hop host decreases the TTL value by one.  By observing a TTL value
   equal to zero, the host rejects the probe and typically returns an
   ICMP message with a TIME_EXCEEDED value.  Traceroute can therefore
   derive the IP address of the first hop from the header of the ICMP
   message and evaluate the RTT between the source and the first hop.
   The next hops are discovered following the same procedure, taking
   care of increasing at each step the TTL value of the outgoing probes
   by one.  The TTL value is increased until either an ICMP
   PORT_UNREACHABLE message is received, meaning that the destination
   has been reached, or the maximum configured number of hops has been
   hit.

   Some implementations, use ICMP Echos, instead of UDP datagrams.
   However, many routers do not return ICMP messages about ICMP
   messages, i.e.  no ICMP TIME_EXCEEDED is returned for an ICMP Echo.
   Therefore, in this draft we RECOMMEND to base implementations on UDP
   datagrams.

2.1  Traceroute configuration parameters

   In order to define an information model for storing traceroutes, we
   first investigated which configuration parameters are relevant when
   running traceroute.  We considered three major traceroute
   implementations and compared them based on configurable parameters
   and default values.  The LINUX (SUSE 9.1) and UNIX (multiple
   platform) implemetations are based on UDP datagrams, while the
   WINDOWS (XP SP2) one uses ICMP Echos.  The following table summarizes
   such comparison.  A N/A in the option column, means that such option
   is not configurable for the specific implementation.

3.  Known problems with traceroute

   The widespred use of firewalls might prevent UDP or ICMP based
   traceroutes to completely trace the path to a destination, since
   traceroute probes might end up being filtered.  In some cases, such
   limitation might be overcome by sending instead TCP packets to
   specific ports that hosts located behind the firewall are listening
   for connections on.  TCP based implementations use TCP SYN or FYN
   probes and listen for TIME_EXCEEDED messages, TCP RESET and other
   messages from firewalls and gateways on the path.  On the other hand,
   some firewalls filter out TCP SYN packets to prevent denial of
   service attacks, therefore the actual advantage of using TCP instead
   of UDP traceroute depends mainly on firewall configurations, which
   are not known in adavance.  A detailed analysis of TCP based
   traceroutes is outside the scope of this draft, therefore in the
   sequel, we will restrict our focus to the most commonly implemented
   UDP based traceroute.

4.  Reports/results

   The following list reports the information fields provided by all
   traceroute implementations considered.  The order in which they are
   reported here is not relevant and it changes in different
   implementations.  For each hop the information reported is:
   o  the hop index;
   o  the host symbolical address, provided that at least one of the
      probes received a response, the symbolic address could be resolved
      at the correponding host and that the option to display only
      numerical addresses was not set;
   o  the host IP address, provided that at least one of the probes
      received a response;
   o  the RTT for each response to a probe.
   It might happen that some probes do not receive a response within the
   configured time-out (for instance if the probe is filtered out by a
   firewall).  In this case, an "*" is displayed in place of the RTT.
   Besides, for delays below 1 ms, some implementations reports 0 ms
   (f.i.  UNIX and LINUX) while WINDOWS tracert reports "< 1 ms".

5.  Information model for storing traceroutes measurements

   This section describes the information model for the traceroute
   measurements data storing.  The information model is composed of
   information elements; for defining these information elements, a
   template is used.  Such template is specified in the list below:

   o  name - A unique and meaningful name for the information element.
      The preferred spelling for the name is to use mixed case if the
      name is compound, with an initial lower case letter, e.g.,
      "sourceIpAddress".
   o  description - The semantics of this information element.
   o  dataType - One of the types listed in Section 5.1 of this document
      or in an extension of the information model.  The type space for
      attributes is constrained to facilitate implementation.
   o  units - If the element is a measure of some kind, the units
      identify what the measure is.
   o  default value - The default value for the element (where
      applicable).

5.1  Data types

   This section describes the set of valid data types of the information
   model.

   o  String - The type "String" represents a finite length string of
      valid characters from the Unicode character encoding set.  Unicode
      allows for ASCII and many other international character sets to be
      used.  It is expected that strings will be encoded in UTF-8
      format, which is identical in encoding for USASCII characters, but
      also accomodates other Unicode multibyte characters.
   o  InetAddressType - The type "InetAddressType" represents a type of
      Internet address.  The allowed values and their syntax are to be
      intended as imported from [1].
   o  InetAddress - The type "InetAddress" denotes a generic Internet
      address.  The allowed values and their syntax are to be intended
      as imported from [1].
   o  TruthValue - The type "TruthValue" represents a boolean value.
      The allowed values and their syntax are to be intended as imported
      from [2].
   o  Unsigned32 - The type "Unsigned32" represents a value in the range
      (0..4294967295).
   o  InterfaceIndexOrZero - The type "InterfaceIndexOrZero" is an
      extension of the InterfaceIndex convention.  The latter defines a
      greater than zero value used to identify an interface or interface
      sub-layer in the system.  This extension permits the additional
      value of zero.  Examples of the usage of zero might include
      situations where interface was unknown, or when none or all

      interfaces need to be referenced.  The allowed values and their
      syntax are to be intended as imported from [5].
   o  ProbesType - The type "ProbesType" represents a way of indicating
      the protocol used for the traceroute probes.  Allowed values are
      UDP, TCP, ICMP.
   o  DateAndTime - The type "DateAndTime" represents a date-time
      specification.  The allowed values and their syntax are to be
      intended as imported from [2].
   o  OperationResponseStatus - The type "OperationResponseStatus" is
      used to report the result of an operation.  The allowed values and
      their syntax are to be intended as imported from [6] or from its
      recent update ([7]).

5.2  Information Elements

   This section describes the elements of the traceroute measurement.
   The elements are grouped in two groups (Configuration and Results)
   according to their semantics.

5.2.1  Configuration Information Elements

   This section describes the elements of the traceroute measurement
   that are specific to traceroute configuration.

5.2.1.1  traceRouteCtlTestName

   o  name - traceRouteCtlTestName
   o  description - Specifies the name of a traceroute test.  This is
      locally unique.
   o  dataType - String
   o  units - N/A
   o  default value - N/A

5.2.1.2  traceRouteCtlTargetAddressType

   o  name - traceRouteCtlTargetAddressType
   o  description - Specifies the type of host address used in the
      traceroute command.
   o  dataType - InetAddressType
   o  units - N/A
   o  default value - N/A

5.2.1.3  traceRouteCtlTargetAddress

   o  name - traceRouteCtlTargetAddress

   o  dataType - InetAddress
   o  units - N/A
   o  default value - N/A

5.2.1.4  traceRouteCtlByPassRouteTable

   o  name - traceRouteCtlByPassRouteTable
   o  description - Specifies if the optional bypassing of the route
      table was enabled or not.  If enabled, the traceroute will bypass
      the normal routing tables and send directly to a host on an
      attached network.  If the host is not on a directly-attached
      network, an error is returned.  This option can be used to perform
      the traceroute operation to a local host through an interface that
      has no route defined.
   o  dataType - TruthValue
   o  units - N/A
   o  default value - false

5.2.1.5  traceRouteCtlProbeDataSize

   o  name - traceRouteCtlProbeDataSize
   o  description - Specifies the size of the data portion of a
      traceroute operation in octets.  If the RECOMMENDED traceroute
      method (UDP datagrams as probes) is used, then the value contained
      in this object is exact.  If another traceroute method is used for
      which the specified size is not appropriate, then the
      implementation should have used whatever size (appropriate to the
      method) is closest to the specified size.  The maximum value for
      this object was computed by substracting the smallest possible IP
      header size of 20 octets (IPv4 header with no options) and the UDP
      header size of 8 octets from the maximum IP packet size.  An IP
      packet has a maximum size of 65535 octets (excluding IPv6
      Jumbograms).
   o  dataType - Unsigned32
   o  units - octects
   o  default value - 0

5.2.1.6  traceRouteCtlTimeOut

   o  name - traceRouteCtlTimeOut
   o  description - Specifies the time-out value, in seconds, for the
      traceroute operation.
   o  dataType - Unsigned32
   o  units - seconds
   o  default value - 3

5.2.1.7  traceRouteCtlProbesPerHop

   o  name - traceRouteCtlProbesPerHop
   o  description - Specifies the number of times to reissue a
      traceroute request with the same time-to-live (TTL) value.
   o  dataType - Unsigned32
   o  units - probes
   o  default value - 3

5.2.1.8  traceRouteCtlPort

   o  name - traceRouteCtlPort
   o  description - Specifies the base UDP port used by the traceroute
      operation.  Need to specify a port that is not in use at the
      destination (target) host.  The default value for this object is
      the IANA assigned port, 33434, for the traceroute function.
   o  dataType - Unsigned32
   o  units - UDP Port
   o  default value - 33434

5.2.1.9  traceRouteCtlMaxTtl

   o  name - traceRouteCtlMaxTtl
   o  description - Specifies the maximum TTL value for the traceroute
      operation.
   o  dataType - Unsigned32
   o  units - time-to-live value
   o  default value - 30

5.2.1.10  traceRouteCtlDSField

   o  name - traceRouteCtlDSField
   o  description - Specifies the value that was stored in the
      Differentiated Services (DS) field in the IP packet used to
      encapsulate the traceroute probe.  The DS Field is defined as the
      Type of Service (TOS) octet in a IPv4 header or as the Traffic
      Class octet in a IPv6 header.  The value of this object must be a
      decimal integer in the range from 0 to 255.  This option can be
      used to determine what effect an explicit DS field setting has on
      a traceroute response.  Not all values are legal or meaningful.
      DS field usage is often not supported by IP implementations.  A
      value of 0 means that the function represented by this option is
      not supported.  Useful TOS octet values are probably '16' (low
      delay) and '8' (high throughput).  Further references can be found
      in [3] for the definition of the Differentiated Services (DS)
      field and to [4] Section 5.3.2 for Type of Service (TOS).
   o  dataType - Unsigned32

   o  units - N/A
   o  default value - N/A

5.2.1.12  traceRouteCtlSourceAddress

   o  name - traceRouteCtlSourceAddress
   o  description - Specifies the IP address (which had to be given as
      an IP number, not a hostname) as the source address used in
      outgoing probe packets.  On hosts with more than one IP address,
      this option can be used to force the source address to be
      something other than the primary IP address of the interface the
      probe packet is sent on.  A zero length octet string value for
      this object means that source address specification was disabled.
      The address type (InetAddressType) that relates to this object is
      specified by the corresponding value of
      traceRouteCtlSourceAddressType.
   o  dataType - InetAddress
   o  units - N/A
   o  default value - N/A

5.2.1.13  traceRouteCtlIfIndex

   o  name - traceRouteCtlIfIndex
   o  description - Specifies the inferface index used in the traceroute
      operation for sending the traceroute probes.  A value of zero for
      this object implies that the interface was unknown.
   o  dataType - InterfaceIndexOrZero
   o  units - N/A
   o  default value - 0

5.2.1.14  traceRouteCtlMiscOptions

   o  name - traceRouteCtlMiscOptions
   o  description - Specifies implementation dependent options.
   o  dataType - String
   o  units - N/A

5.2.1.15  traceRouteCtlMaxFailures

   o  name - traceRouteCtlMaxFailures
   o  description - Specifies the maximum number of consecutive timeouts
      allowed before terminating a traceroute operation.  A value of
      either 255 (maximum hop count/possible TTL value) or a 0 indicates
      that the function of terminating a remote traceroute operation
      when a specific number of consecutive timeouts are detected was
      disabled.  This element is included to give full compatibility
      with [7].  No known implementation of traceroute currently
      supports it.
   o  dataType - Unsigned32
   o  units - timeouts
   o  default value - 5

5.2.1.16  traceRouteCtlDontFragment

   o  name - traceRouteCtlDontFragment
   o  description - Specifies if the don't fragment flag (DF) in the IP
      header for a probe was enabled or not.  The use of the DF flag is

   o  dataType - TruthValue
   o  units - N/A
   o  default value - false

5.2.1.17  traceRouteCtlInitialTtl

   o  name - traceRouteCtlInitialTtl
   o  description - Specifies the initial TTL value uses in a traceroute
      operation.  The use of initial TTL setting is intended to be used
      when bypassing the initial (often well known) portion of a path is
      to be achieved.
   o  dataType - Unsigned32
   o  units - N/A
   o  default value - 1

5.2.1.18  traceRouteCtlDescr

6.  Data model for storing traceroutes measurements

   Discussion about the data model to be adopted for the traceroute
   storing is currently ongoing on the IPPM mailing list.  The
   possibilities would be to define either just a textual representation
   or both textual and binary representations.

   Both approaches have pros and cons: the main issue is related to
   parsing resources associated with the representation itself as a
   trade-off versus readability.  A good textual representation could be
   XML-based but it requires expensive parsers; that is why if the group
   would like to have an XML-based text representation we suggest to
   have also a binary representation that let the user choose how they
   want to store the measurement.  Another possibility could also be to
   have a textual representation that require little parsing without a
   binary representation associated.

   For the data model choice there is the need to agree on the
   Information model defined in Section 5 and on the metrics defined in
   Section 7. On such a basis the data model itself will be defined.

7.  Relevant metrics for traceroute measurements

   The previous sections of this draft have been dealing with the
   traceroute tool description, its parameters and the output that is
   going to be stored; in this section we want to highlight the relevant
   metrics that are of interest when storing traceroute measurements.

   Since the traceroute has built-in configurable mechanisms like
   time-outs and can experience problems related to the crossing of
   firewalls, some of the packets that traceroute sends out end up being
   time-out or filtered.  Sometimes it is impossible to trace the path
   to a node or there is not a complete set of probes describing the RTT
   to reach it.  Classical metrics already standardized by the IPPM
   working group have to be closely examined in order to check for their
   applicability in the traceroute context.  If some metrics are found
   not to be adequate, the authors will propose new metrics to remove
   the inconsistencies.  The metrics that are currently under
   investigation by the authors of this draft are:

   o  Round-trip delay metrics
   o  Connectivity metrics
   o  Loss metrics

8.  Conclusions

   This draft attempts to define a standard way to store traceroute
   measurements.  The document starts by examining a set of traceroute
   tools from the most common operatying systems and provides a summary
   of configurable and default input parameters.  This investigation
   served as base for the definition of an information model and related
   data model.  Furthermore, this draft tackles the issue of metrics
   resulting from traceroute measurements.  Metrics already standardized
   by the IPPM might indeed not be directly applicable to traceroute
   results, where it is necessary to take into account, for instance,
   for missing responses.  The detailed analysis of the different
   metrics and potential proposals to overcome possible inconsistencies
   will be topic for future work.  A number of open issues that still
   need to be discussed in the IPPM mailing list was also drafted.

9.  Security considerations

   Conducting Internet measurements can raise both security and privacy
   concerns.  Traceroute measurements, in which traffic is injected into
   the network, can be abused for denial-of-service attacks disguised as
   legitimate measurement activity.  This memo does not specify an
   implementation of the metrics, so it does not directly affect the
   security of the Internet nor of applications which run on the
   Internet.  However, implementations of these metrics must be mindful
   of security and privacy concerns.  Since traceroute measurements
   involve metrics of different types, each of the metric defined for
   storing traceroute measurments needs separate security considerations
   that are basically already covedered in the related RFCs published by
   the IPPM working group.  The measurement parameters MUST be carefully
   selected so that the measurements inject trivial amounts of
   additional traffic into the networks they measure.  If they inject
   "too much" traffic, they can skew the results of the measurement, and
   in extreme cases cause congestion and denial of service.  The
   measurements themselves could be harmed by routers giving measurement
   traffic a different priority than "normal" traffic, or by an attacker
   injecting artificial measurement traffic.  If routers can recognize
   measurement traffic and treat it separately, the measurements will
   not reflect actual user traffic.  If an attacker injects artificial
   traffic that is accepted as legitimate, the loss rate will be
   artificially lowered.  Therefore, the measurement methodologies
   SHOULD include appropriate techniques to reduce the probability
   measurement traffic can be distinguished from "normal" traffic.
   Authentication techniques, such as digital signatures, may be used
   where appropriate to guard against injected traffic attacks.
