Internet-Draft               Ed25519 for SSH                 August 2015


1.  Introduction

   Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC4251] is a secure remote-login protocol.  It
   provides for an extensible variety of public key algorithms for
   identifying servers and users to one another.  Ed25519
   [I-D.josefsson-eddsa-ed25519] is a digital signature system.
   OpenSSH 6.5 [OpenSSH-6.5] introduced support for using Ed25519 for
   server and user authentication.  Compatible support for Ed25519 has
   since been added to other SSH implementations.

   This document describes the method implemented by OpenSSH and others,
   and formalizes its use of the name "ssh-ed25519".

   Comments on this draft are welcomed and should be sent to the author.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The descriptions of key and signature formats use the notation
   introduced in [RFC4251], Section 3 and the string data type from
   [RFC4251], Section 5.

3.  Public Key Algorithm

   This document describes a public key algorithm for use with SSH in
   accordance with [RFC4253], Section 6.6.  The name of the algorithm is
   "ssh-ed25519".  This algorithm only supports signing and not
   encryption.

4.  Public Key Format

   The "ssh-ed25519" key format has the following encoding:

      string    "ssh-ed25519"
      string    key

   Here 'key' is the 32-octet public key described by
   [I-D.josefsson-eddsa-ed25519], Section 5.5.

5.  Signature Algorithm

   Signatures are generated according to the procedure in
   [I-D.josefsson-eddsa-ed25519], Section 5.6.

6.  Signature format

   The corresponding signature format is:

Internet-Draft               Ed25519 for SSH                 August 2015


      string    "ssh-ed25519"
      string    signature

   Here 'signature' is the 64-octet signature produced in accordance
   with [I-D.josefsson-eddsa-ed25519], Section 5.6.

7.  Verification Algorithm

   Signatures are verified according to the procedure in
   [I-D.josefsson-eddsa-ed25519], Section 5.7.

8.  SSHFP DNS resource records

   The generation of SSHFP resource records for "ssh-ed25519" keys is
   described in [RFC7479].

9.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign the Public Key Algorithm name
   "ssh-ed25519" in accordance with [RFC4250], Section 4.6.2:

                    Public Key Algorithm Name Reference
                    ------------------------- ---------
                    ssh-ed25519               [RFCXXXX]

   [TO BE REMOVED: This registration should take place at the following
   location: <http://www.iana.org/assignments/ssh-parameters/ssh-
   parameters.xhtml#ssh-parameters-19>]

10.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations in [RFC4251], Section 9 apply to all SSH
   implementations, including those using Ed25519.

   The security considerations in [I-D.josefsson-eddsa-ed25519],
   Section 9 apply to all uses of Ed25519, including those in SSH.

11.  Acknowledgements

   The OpenSSH implementation of Ed25519 in SSH was written by Markus
   Friedl.
