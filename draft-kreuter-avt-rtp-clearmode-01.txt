Abstract 
    
   This document describes how to carry 64 kbit/s or Nx64 kbit/s data 
   streams transparently in RTP packets, using a pseudo-codec called 
   "CLEARMODE". It also serves as registration for a related MIME type 
   called "audio/CLEARMODE".

1. Introduction 
    
   Voice over IP media gateways need to carry all data streams generated 
   by analog TDM or ISDN terminals via an IP network. 
   ISDN wideband speech terminals do not rely on a voice data processing 
   (e.g. echo cancellation or DTMF detection) within a Voice over IP 
   media gateway. And ISDN data terminals e.g. will produce data streams 
   that are not compatible with a non-linear encoding as is used for 
   voice. 
   For such applications, there exists a necessity for a transparent 
   relay of 64 kbit/s data streams in RTP packets. This mode is often 
   referred to as "clear-channel data" or "64 kbit/s unrestricted". No 
   encoder/decoder is needed in that case, but a unique RTP [5] payload 
   type is necessary and a related MIME type is to be registered for 
   signaling purposes. 
    
   This payload format document describes a pseudo-codec called 
   "CLEARMODE", for sample-oriented 64 kbit/s or Nx64 kbit/s data 
   streams with 8 bits per sample. It is in accordance with RFC 2736 
   [8], which provides a guideline for the specification of new RTP 
   payload formats. 
   Examples for the use of CLEARMODE in current VoIP media gateways are 
   the transfer of "ISDN 7 kHz voice" and "ISDN data". 
    
   This document also serves as the MIME type registration according RFC 
   2048 [4], which defines procedures for registration of new MIME types 
   within the IETF tree. 
    
    
2. 64 kbit/s data stream handling and RTP header parameters 
    
   The profile specifies the use of RTP over unicast and multicast UDP 
   as well as TCP. 
   (This does not preclude the use of this definition when RTP is 
   carried by other lower-layer protocols.) 
    
   CLEARMODE does not use any encoding or decoding. It just provides 
   packetization.

   The payload handling for CLEARMODE is similar to the PCMU or PCMA 
   handling described in [9]. Each CLEARMODE octet is octet-aligned in a 
   RTP packet. The sign bit of each CLEARMODE octet corresponds to the 
   most significant bit of the octet in the RTP packet (i.e., assuming 
   the CLEARMODE samples are handled as octets on the host machine, the 
   sign bit is the most significant bit of the octet as defined by the 
   host machine format). 
    
   A sample rate of 8000 Hz is used. 
    
   Note, that the payload format described here assumes that the data to 
   be handled is sample oriented with one octet (8bits) per sample. 
   Together with the 8000 Hz sample rate this calculates to a 64 kbit/s 
   transmission rate per channel. 
    
   The Timestamp SHALL be set according [5] 
    
   The marker bit is always zero. Silence suppression is not applicable 
   for CLEARMODE data streams. 
    
   The payload type is dynamically assigned by means outside the scope 
   of this document. 
    
    
3. Nx64 kbit/s data stream handling 
    
   Nx64 kbit/s with N>1 SHALL be an optional enhancement of the 64 
   kbit/s case. 
    
   In this case the size of the RTP packet's payload MUST be a multiple 
   of N. 
   The data of the N channels SHALL be interleaved per byte. That is the 
   first N bytes of the RTP payload represent the first byte of each 
   channel. 
    
   The sequence of the N channels is negotiated between sender and 
   receiver by means outside the scope of this document.

   Required parameters: none 
    
   Optional parameters: ptime 
          This represents the packet length in milliseconds [7]. 
    
   Optional parameters: bw 
          This represents the bandwidth (Nx64) in kbit/s. The default 
          value is "64". 
          This parameter is mandatory for Nx64 kbit/s, with N>1. 
    
   Encoding considerations: This type is only defined for transfer via 
          RTP [5]. 
    
   Security considerations: Implementations using the profile defined in 
          this specification are subject to the security considerations 
          discussed in the RTP specification [5]. 
    
   Interoperability considerations: none 
    
   Published specification: This document 
    
   Applications which use this media type: Voice over IP Media Gateways, 
          transferring "ISDN 64 kb/s data" or "ISDN 7 kHz voice" or 
          other VoIP-related Nx64 kbit/s data streams via an RTP 
          connection. 
    
   Additional information: none 
    
   Intended usage: COMMON 
    
   Author/Change controller: This registration is part of the IETF 
   registration tree. 
    
    
5. Security Considerations 
    
   Implementations using the profile defined in this specification are 
   subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP 
   specification [5]. This profile does not specify any different 
   security services. The primary function of this profile is to add a 
   transparent transport for a 64 kbit/s or Nx64 kbit/s data stream. 
   Confidentiality of the media streams is achieved by encryption. Since 
   there is no processing of the data stream other than packetization 
   and depacketization, there is no interference to an end-to-end 
   encryption mechanism.
