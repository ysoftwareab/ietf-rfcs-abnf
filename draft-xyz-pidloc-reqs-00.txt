       Requirements to Secure End to End Privacy in IdLoc Systems
                      draft-xyz-pidloc-reqs-00.txt

Abstract

   Use of Identifier Locator separation systems is proposed for various
   use cases to allow for efficient and service aware flexible end-to-
   end routing.  A statement on the issue of privacy preservation of
   both users and devices identity and location describes major
   challenges identified for this problem.  This document attempts to
   derive requirements towards a potential solution space of approaches
   to preserve privacy in Identifier-Locator split (PidLoc) protocols.

1.  Introduction

   [I-D.xyz-pidloc-ps] has identified and described typical use cases
   for application of privacy preserving Identifier-Locator split
   (PidLoc) approaches and derived thereof a problem statement
   describing corresponding issues and challenges.  Privacy in this
   respect includes prevention of acquisition of personal information,
   behavioral details, and location information by unauthorised parties.
   This document tries to assess that set of issues and challenges to
   come up with a set of requirements for approaches towards service
   specific and optimized packet routing based on Id-Loc principle
   providing privacy and security.

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119] and
   [I-D.xyz-pidloc-ps].

3.  Identifier Locator Separation Protocols

   This section summarizes the specifics and commonalities of existing
   Identifier Locator (Id-Loc) Separation Protocols and highlights the
   corresponding challenges and issues identified in
   [I-D.xyz-pidloc-ps].

4.  PId-Loc Requirements

   This section lists requirements which emerge from the use case
   analysis and will apply (beside the general requirements to fit with
   privacy considerations for Internet Protocols as laid down in RFC
   6973 [RFC6973] and partly also on design criteria for confidentiality
   in the data plane of LISP described in RFC 8061 [RFC8061]) for the
   solution space providing privacy and security in generic Identifier
   Locator Split Approaches.

4.1.  Limited Effort

   The measures to ensure privacy to Id-Loc systems shall not require
   additional infrastructure and external third party provided resources
   to be used nor increase the overall effort such that network and
   service performance is strongly degraded.  Successful privacy
   measures shall not impact availability.

4.2.  Flexibility

   Because Id-Loc approaches can be used in mobile environments,
   flexibility in time and space should be provided.  The same Id,
   associated to a specific device, can move around and at different
   times can have different privacy requirements, may be depending on
   the specific connection or provider used.  Still because of mobility,
   a certain device can have different privacy requirements depending of
   where it is.

4.3.  Scalability

   Because some of the ID-Loc proposals aim at being deployed in
   datacenters, the methods to ensure privacy has to be able to function
   at very large scale.

4.4.  Resiliency

   The measure shall not rely on a potential single point of failure nor
   a single mechanism and allow for automatic rebooting or relying on
   alternative solutions in case of compromise and attacks.

4.5.  ID to Locator Association Protection

   The Id-Loc system may need to use measures for binding one or more
   identifiers to one or more locators.  This is usually achieved by a
   mapping or lookup system (e.g.  DNS) which has to be protected
   against unauthorised access and may allow for different policy-based
   chosen levels of security.  Like any other software-based service,
   the mapping system has to be protected against DDoS attacks and the
   like.  However, there are specific points to be tackled:

   o  Mapping System Access Control: Who can access the mapping system?

   o  Mapping Access Control: Someone authorized to access the mapping
      system does not mean that is authorized to access the mapping of a
      specific Identifier.

   o  Byzantines Attacks: What if someone is able to inject tempered
      information to attack either the mapping system itself of a
      specific identifier?

   The above may be defined on various criteria, like for instance
   administrative criteria "devices part of the same company", or
   geographical criteria "only close by devices", or service-aware
   "devices operating the same service".

5.  IANA Considerations

   TBD.
