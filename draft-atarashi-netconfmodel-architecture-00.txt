Abstract

   For the new network configuration concept discussed at NETCONF, we
   mention the importance of building new network architecture.  We can
   not develop and discuss the concept using XML because it is only
   tools but the concept is confusable.  The consensus of architecture

1.  Introduction

   For the new network configuration concept discussed at NETCONF, we
   mention the importance of building new network architecture.  We can
   not develop and discuss the concept using XML because it is only
   tools but the concept is confusable.  The consensus of architecture
   is required to clarify the items and technologies that should be
   discussed and standardized at IETF.

   As such, we will make specific recommendations for all applications.
   In doing so, we will use the language described in RFC 2119 [1].  The
   key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].

2.  Proposal

   In the discussion for XML configuration at NETCONF, a global
   architecture SHOULD be developed to arrange the technology components
   and make common image for configuration.  Since XML is only tool, it
   can not be defined concept and architecture.  The configuration tool
   using XML tag without consideration of architecture may be useful at
   once, it will obsolete by new technology and standard.

   It is useful for the network operator to configure network equipments
   and to see MIB information and network configuration using XML.  It
   is important to discuss SOAP, MIB, security, and so on as tools for
   configuration, but is difficult to share the whole image of
   requirements.  We need to review the global network architecture to
   check and confirm the action item.

   XML is only tools based on the concept of metadata and RDF, and have
   many possibilities for network architecture.  We are required to
   understand the concept of XML related technologies and to discuss the
   application of these technologies for standard.  Since XML
   technologies are originally defined for contents and applications, it
   is also suitable for contents delivery network.  We can describe the
   network policy using XML.  The Distributed Management Task Force,
   inc.  Distributed Management Task Force, inc.  [2] (DMTF) discuss the
   XML mapping tool of Common Information Model (CIM).  We develop the
   whole architecture by including existing concepts and technologies
   related network configuration and management.

   The global architecture including next generation internet
   technologies such as IPv6 and QoS also involve the new network
   architecture.  The Migration strategy is required for the new
   architecture.  Since XML is developed for contents and application,
   it has not been considered to apply to the network control.  There
   are not tools and implementations for network.  It is required to
   implement some technologies for network configuration such as tools,
   APIs, and so on using XML.

5.  Deployment Story

   The deployment story is required to deploy the architecture.  This is
   our proposal.

   o  Phase 1: router and switch conf for ISP/career.
   o  Phase 1.5: router and switch conf for enterprise.
   o  Phase 2: SOHO home router and appliance control.
   o  Phase 3: mobile application and so on.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document discusses motivation and architecture of XML network
   management.  If implemented as described, it should ask the network
   to do nathing that the network has already allowd.  If that is the
   case, no new security issues should arise from the use of such a
   architecture.
