Abstract

   This document describes the use of the ARIA block cipher algorithm
   in the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) for providing
   confidentiality for the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) traffic
   and for the control traffic for RTP, the Real-time Transport Control
   Protocol (RTCP).



1. Introduction

   This document describes the use of the ARIA [RFC5794] block cipher
   algorithm in the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) [RFC3711]
   for providing confidentiality for the Real-time Transport Protocol
   (RTP) [RFC3550] traffic and for the control traffic for RTP, the
   Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP) [RFC3550].

1.1. ARIA

   ARIA is a general-purpose block cipher algorithm developed by Korean
   cryptographers in 2003. It is an iterated block cipher with 128-,
   192-, and 256-bit keys and encrypts 128-bit blocks in 12, 14, and 16
   rounds, depending on the key size. It is secure and suitable for
   most software and hardware implementations on 32-bit and 8-bit
   processors. It was established as a Korean standard block cipher
   algorithm in 2004 [ARIAKS] and has been widely used in Korea,
   especially for government-to-public services. It was included in
   PKCS #11 in 2007 [ARIAPKCS]. The algorithm specification and object
   identifiers are described in [RFC5794].

1.2. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2. Cryptographic Transforms

   All symmetric block cipher algorithms share common characteristics
   including mode, key size, weak keys, and block size. The following
   sections contain descriptions of the relevant characteristics of
   ARIA.

   ARIA does not have any restrictions for modes of operation that are
   used with this block cipher. We define three modes of running ARIA,
   (1) ARIA in Counter Mode, (2) ARIA in Counter with CBC-MAC (CCM)
   Mode and (3) ARIA in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) Mode.

2.1. Counter

   Section 4.1.1 of [RFC3711] defines AES counter mode encryption,
   which it refers to as AES-CM. ARIA counter mode is defined in a
   similar manner, and is denoted as ARIA-CTR. The plaintext inputs to
   the block cipher are formed as in AES-CM, and the block cipher
   outputs are processed as in AES-CM. The only difference in the
   processing is that ARIA-CTR uses ARIA as the underlying encryption
   primitive. When ARIA-CTR is used, it MUST be used only in
   conjunction with an authentication function.

2.1.1. Message Authentication/Integrity: HMAC-SHA1

   HMAC-SHA1 [RFC2104], as defined in section 4.2.1 of [RFC3711], SHALL
   be the default message authentication code to be used with ARIA-CTR.
   The default session authentication key-length SHALL be 160 bits, the
   default authentication tag length SHALL be 80 bits, and the
   SRTP_PREFIX_LENGTH SHALL be zero for HMAC-SHA1. For SRTP, smaller
   values are NOT RECOMMENDED, but MAY be used after careful
   consideration of the issues in section 7.5 and 9.5 of [RFC3711].

2.2. Counter with CBC-MAC (CCM)

   CCM is a generic authenticate-and-encrypt block cipher mode
   [RFC3610]. In this specification, CCM used with the ARIA block
   cipher is denoted as ARIA-CCM. Section 3.3 of [RFC3711] defines
   procedures to construct or to authenticate and decrypt SRTP packets.
   For ARIA-CCM however, the sender performs Step 7 before Step 5 and
   the receiver performs the second half of Step 5 (performs
   verification) after Step 6. This means that authentication is
   performed on the plaintext rather than the ciphertext. This applies
   equally to SRTCP

   All SRTP packets MUST be authenticated and encrypted. Unlike SRTP,
   SRTCP packet encryption is optional (but authentication is


Kim et al.              Expires June 20, 2011                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                ARIA-SRTP              December 22, 2010


   mandatory). A sender can select which packets to encrypt, and
   indicates this choice with a 1-bit encryption flag (located in the
   leftmost bit of the 32-bit word that contains the SRTCP index).

   ARIA-CCM has two parameters:

     M  M indicates the size of the authentication tag. In SRTP, a
         full 80-bit authentication-tag SHOULD be used and
         implementation of this specification MUST support M values of
         10 octets.

     L  L indicates the size of the length field in octets. The number
         of octets in the nonce MUST be 12, i.e., L is 3.

   ARIA-CCM has four inputs:

     Key

         A single key is used to calculate the authentication tag using
         CBC-MAC and to perform payload encryption using counter mode.
         ARIA only supports a key size of 128 bits.

     Nonce

         The size of the nonce depends on the value selected for the
         parameter L. It is 15-L octets. L equals 3 and hence the nonce
         size equals 12 octets.

     Plaintext

         In case of SRTP, the payload of the RTP packet and the RTP
         padding and RTP pad count field (if the latter two fields are
         present).

         In case of SRTCP, when the encryption flag is set to 1, the
         Encrypted Portion described in Fig.2 of [RFC3711] is treated as
         plaintext. When the encryption flag is set to 0, the plaintext
         is zero-length.

     Additional Authentication Data (AAD)

         In case of SRTP, the header of the RTP packet including
         contributing source (CSRC) identifier (if present) and the RTP
         header extension (if present).

         In case of SRTCP, when the encryption flag is set to 0, the
         Authentication Portion described in Fig.2 of [RFC3711] is


Kim et al.              Expires June 20, 2011                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                ARIA-SRTP              December 22, 2010


         treated as AAD. When the encryption flag is set to 1, the first
         8-octets, the encryption flag and SRTCP index are treated as
         AAD.

     ARIA-CCM accepts these four inputs and returns a ciphertext field.

2.3. Galois/Counter Mode (GCM)

   GCM is a block cipher mode of operation providing both
   confidentiality and data origin authentication [GCM]. GCM used with
   the ARIA block cipher is denoted as ARIA-GCM.

   ARIA-GCM has four inputs: a key, a plaintext, a nonce and the
   additional authenticated data (AAD) all described in section 2.2.

   The bit length of the tag, denoted t, is 12, and an authentication
   tag with a length of 12 octets (96 bits) is used.

3. Nonce Format for CCM and GCM

3.1. Nonce for SRTP

   The nonce for SRTP SHALL be formed in the following way:

        Nonce = (16 bits of zeroes || SSRC || ROC || SEQ) XOR Salt

   The 4-octet SSRC and the 2-octet SEQ SHALL be taken from the RTP
   header. The 4-octet ROC is from the cryptographic context. The 12-
   octet Salt SHALL be produced by the SRTP Key Derivation Function.

3.2. Nonce for SRTCP

   The nonce for SRTCP SHALL be formed in the following way:

         Nonce = (16 bits of zeroes || SSRC || 16 bits of zeroes ||
                   SRTCP index) XOR Salt

   The 4-octet SSRC SHALL be taken from the RTCP header and the 31-bit
   SRTCP index (packed zero-filled, right justified into a 4-octet
   field) is from each packet. The 12-octet Salt SHALL be produced by
   the SRTP Key Derivation Function.

4. Key Derivation: ARIA-CTR PRF

   Section 4.3.3 of [RFC3711] defines the AES-128 counter mode key
   derivation function, which it refers to as "AES-CM PRF". The ARIA-

Internet-Draft                ARIA-SRTP              December 22, 2010


   CTR PRF is defined in a similar manner, but with each invocation of
   AES replaced with an invocation of ARIA.

   The currently defined PRF, keyed by the 128-bit master key, has
   input block size m = 128 and can produce n-bit outputs for n up to
   2^23. ARIA-PRF_n(k_master, x) SHALL be ARIA in Counter Mode as
   described in section 2.1, applied to key k_master, and IV equal to
   (x*2^16), and with the output keystream truncated to the n first
   (left-most) bits.

5. Mandatory-to-implement Transforms

   "Mandatory-to-implement" means conformance to this specification,
   and that Table 1 does not supersede a similar table in section 5 of
   [RFC3711]. An RTP implementation that supports ARIA MUST implement
   the modes listed in Table 1.

   SRTCP.

6. Security Considerations

   At the time of writing this document no security problem has been
   found on ARIA (see [YWL]).

   The security considerations in [RFC3711] apply to this document as
   well.

   See [RFC3610] and [GCM] for security considerations regarding the
   CCM and GCM modes of operations, respectively.

7. IANA Considerations

   [RFC4568] defines SRTP "crypto suites". In order to allow SDP to
   signal the use of the algorithms defined in this document, IANA will
   register the following crypto suites into the subregistry for SRTP
   crypto suites under the SRTP transport of the SDP Security
   Descriptions:

      srtp-crypto-suite-ext = "ARIA_CTR_128_HMAC_SHA1_80"/
                             "ARIA_128_CCM_80"/

A.4. Key Derivation Test Vector

   This section provides data for the default key derivation function,
   which uses ARIA-128 in Counter Mode. In the following, we walk
   through the initial key derivation for the ARIA-128 Counter Mode
   cipher, which requires a 16 octet session encryption key and a 14
   octet session salt, and an authentication function which requires a
   94 octet session authentication key. These values are called the
   cipher key, the cipher salt, and the auth key in the following. The
   test vectors are generated in a similar way with the test vector of
   key derivation function in [RFC3711] but with each invocation of AES
   replaced with an invocation of ARIA.

   The inputs to the key derivation function are the 16 octet master
   key and the 14 octet master salt:

       master key:  e1f97a0d3e018be0d64fa32c06de4139
       master salt: 0ec675ad498afeebb6960b3aabe6

       cipher key:    dbd85a3c4d9219b3e81f7d942e299de4 (ARIA-CTR output)

   ARIA-CTR cipher suite requires 14 octet cipher salt while ARIA-CCM
   and ARIA-GCM cipher suites require 12 octet cipher salt.
