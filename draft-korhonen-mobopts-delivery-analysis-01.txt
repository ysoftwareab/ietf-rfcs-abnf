Internet-Draft           LPCI Delivery Analysis             October 2006


1.  Introduction

   Recently mobile nodes are increasingly being equipped with multiple
   interfaces for different L2 technologies.  These mobile nodes may be
   reachable via different links at the same time or use each interface
   independently depending on the network environment.  In the latter
   case, transitions between heterogeneous links (vertical handovers)
   occur.  Existing IP mobility solutions do not provide a mechanism to
   indicate which type of link the mobile node is currently attached to
   or what kind of characteristics the link has.  Therefore, sudden
   changes of access link characteristics are not observed quickly
   enough by higher layer protocols and applications.  Usually nothing
   is done until a certain protocol or application dependent mechanism
   (e.g., congestion control or error recovery mechanism) is invoked
   some time later when a misuse of the network capacity has been
   detected.  Link Characteristic Information delivery mechanism
   provides a mechanism to communicate link and path characteristic
   changes to the remote peer node.

   This documents lists and analyses various IP Mobility, signaling and
   transport layer protocols in order to evaluate their suitability for
   delivering link and path characteristic information between two
   communicating end points.  The analysis should determine whether
   existing IP Mobility, signaling or transport player protocols can be
   reused for delivering the LPCI Link and Path Characteristic
   Information between the communicating end nodes.  If existing
   protocols are not applicable or there is not possible to achieve the
   information delivery in a reasonable way then the development of a
   generic protocol should be considered.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Link and Path Characteristic Information (LPCI):

      An object delivered between communicating end points that contains
      information about the link or path characteristics.


2.  Scope

   This document concentrates on a limited set of existing candidate
   protocols for Link Characteristic Information (LPCI) delivery.  The
   suitability of these protocols is evaluated.

2.1.  In Scope

   Within the scope of this analysis is going through all IP Mobility,
   signaling and transport protocols listed in Section 3 and carefully
   verifying whether the protocols are suitable for delivering LPCI
   between end points.  This basically means studying whether each
   protocol is able to be extended to carry additional payloads related
   to LPCI.

   The analysis should also study whether the studied protocol allows
   delivering the LPCI sporadically without a handover to taking place.
   This could a useful feature when the link characteristics change
   considerably mid session even without mobility.  An abrupt change,
   e.g., at the wireless link could justify delivering LPCI to the other
   peer.

   For each studied protocol the security aspects must also be taken
   into account.  The LPCI delivery mechanism must not offer off-path
   adversaries the possibility to inject LPCI.  Furthermore, the ability
   to modify the content by an on-path attacker has to be considered.
   Finally, a malicious end host must not be able to disturb the
   behavior of other end hosts.

2.2.  Out of Scope

   Clearly out of scope this analysis document are the mechanisms how
   the mobile node gathers the LPCI.

   This document does not describe extensions for carrying LPCI nor does
   it describe the content of the LPCI.  This task is subject for
   separate documents.


3.  Candidate Protocols

   This section discusses some possible candidate protocols to carry a
   "container" format that could be used with all protocols.

   o  IPv4 - Analyze LPCI delivery using IPv4 header options.  There is
      the risk that IPv4 packets with IP options are dropped by routers.

   o  IPv6 - Analyze LPCI delivery using IPv6 header options.  This
      analysis should also study which option type is the most
      appropriate to use.

Internet-Draft           LPCI Delivery Analysis             October 2006


   o  SIP - Analyze LPCI delivery using SIP headers

   o  Mobile IPv4 - Analyze LPCI delivery as part of the Mobile IP
      registration messages options.  One of the important aspects is to
      analyze possible mid-session usage where there is no need to do a
      registration of new care-of address.

   o  Mobile IPv6 - Analyze LPCI delivery as part of the Mobile IP
      binding update messages options.  One of the important aspects is
      to analyse possible mid-session usage where there is no need to do
      a registration of new care-of address.

   o  HIP - Analyze LPCI delivery as part of the HIP base exchange and
      UPDATE messages after a handover using for example NOTIFY
      payloads.

   o  NSIS - Analyze LPCI delivery using NSIS mobility signaling with
      possible required changes to support LPCI.

   o  CTP - Analyze whether CTP could be used for LPCI delivery.

   o  TCP - Analyze LPCI delivery using TCP options.  Also take a look
      into TCP Quick-Start as one possible user of the LPCI information.

   o  DCCP - Analyze LPCI delivery using DCCP options.

   o  SCTP - Analyze LPCI delivery using SCTP chunks.  The multi-homing
      aspect is considered important in case of SCTP.

   o  RTP/RTCP. - Analyze LPCI delivery using RTP and/or RTCP header
      options.

3.1.  IP protocol

   IP protocol versions 4 [RFC0791] and 6 [RFC2460] are the basic
   network layer protocols used on The Internet.  Both IPv4 and IPv6
   provide an "options" field where a single option has a limitation of
   256 octets total length.  IPv6 provides more flexibility in option
   handling, as separate option classes exist for options that need to
   be examined by all intermediate nodes on a path or only at the
   destination.  IPv4 options have no such classification, and options
   are checked at all nodes.  Because there is no separate class for
   end-to-end options, all intermediate nodes have to examine all
   options; Due to performance reasons such options are often filtered
   and do not reliably reach destination.  Furthermore, intermediate
   nodes tend to drop IPv4 packets with options they do not understand
   [MAF04].

Internet-Draft           LPCI Delivery Analysis             October 2006


3.2.  SIP

   Session initiation protocol [RFC3261] is a protocol with the explicit
   purpose of setting up sessions.  The actual data protocol
   communication is separate from the set-up.  As such, any LPCI
   information transferred over SIP would be used as initial parameters
   for the session and, if applicable, subsequently as updates to the
   session.

   Sessions that are set up are described using Session description
   protocol, or SDP [RFC2327].  The SDP parameters are pure text, and
   include such variables as the session protocol to be used, protocol
   ports, IP addresses, session participants and so on.  LPCI
   information for a session can be carried inside SDP as an extra
   parameter.

   SIP information can be transferred via several proxies, and
   information about specific potential participant can be registered to
   SIP registrars, allowing for delegation of LPCI information.

3.3.  Mobile IP

   Mobile IPv4 [RFC3344] provides a general protocol support for a IPv4
   mobile node to register its current location with the Home Agent and
   in that way create or update the mobility binding between mobile
   node's current care-of-address and the Home Agent.  The used Mobile
   IPv4 registration messages offer a general extensibility mechanism.
   Extension parameters are also integrity protected.

   The mobile node may also send the registration request at any time
   even if there is no handover taking place.  The recent addition of
   the NAT traversal allows mobile nodes communicating behind NATs.  The
   same NAT traversal mechanism also allows mobile nodes to communicate
   fluently through statefull firewalls even if the original goal was to
   allow NATs in visited networks.

   Unfortunately, base Mobile IPv4 only provides a mechanism to exchange
   Mobile IPv4 control messages between the mobile node and the foreign
   agent or between the mobile node and the home agent.  The lack of
   route optimization in base Mobile IPv4 prevents mobile nodes
   exchanging any control messages directly between the mobile node and
   the correspondent node or even between the home agent and the
   correspondent node.

   In contrast to Mobile IPv4, Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775] provides a route
   optimization feature as an integral feature of the base specification
   that allows the mobile node to send its mobility binding directly to
   the correspondent node.  After a successful route optimization



Korhonen, et al.         Expires April 26, 2007                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft           LPCI Delivery Analysis             October 2006


   binding update the mobile node and the correspondent node start
   communicating directly end-to-end with each other.  The route
   optimization is an optional feature and mobile nodes are not
   obligated to use it.

3.4.  CTP

   Context transfer protocol [RFC4067] is a protocol designed to
   expedite handovers for a mobile node.  It allows "contexts" to be
   transferred from the mobile node's current access router to new
   access router before the handover.  If a break-before-make handover
   occurs, the new access router can also request the context transfer
   from the previous one afterwards.

   An example of "context" is multicast listener information, where
   transferring the information lowers the cost of the handover
   considerably.

   CTP uses ICMP messages between the mobile node and the access router,
   and SCTP between access routers.  Because CTP is always a separate
   message, LPCI messages could be bundled inside a CTP message that is
   going to be sent anyway (i.e. when changing access routers).
   However, when link information changes without access router
   changing, (Such as when roaming from 3G to GPRS), every CTP message
   is causing significant load on the network.  Thus it may fail
   requirement R5 for lightweight operation.

3.5.  HIP

   The Host Identity Protocol [RFC4423] creates a new cryptographic
   namespace placed between the transport and the network layer.  One of
   the extensions defined for HIP concerns mobility and multi-homing
   [I-D.ietf-hip-mm].

   When a host moves to another address, it notifies its peer of the new
   address by sending a HIP UPDATE packet containing a LOCATOR
   parameter.  This UPDATE packet is then acknowledged by the peer.
   LPCI can be exchanged as part of the UPDATE packet.

3.6.  NSIS

   Next Steps in Signaling protocol suite (see GIST
   [I-D.ietf-nsis-ntlp], QoS NSLP [I-D.ietf-nsis-qos-nslp], NATFW NSLP
   [I-D.ietf-nsis-nslp-natfw] and an overview of the framework in
   [RFC4080]) aims to provide a generic signaling protocol.  One of the
   applications, such as the QoS NSLP, allows QoS signaling message to
   be carried between two end points and to let intermediate routers to
   participate along the path.  NSIS offers functionality similar to



Korhonen, et al.         Expires April 26, 2007                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft           LPCI Delivery Analysis             October 2006


   RSVP, but aims to be more generic and covers more usage environments.

   When designing a solution using NSIS three cases need to be
   considered.  If the data sender moves (or switches to a different
   link layer interface) then the impact will most likely be at the side
   of the data sender.  If the data receiver moves (or switches to a
   different link layer interface) then the impact will most likely be
   at the side of the data receiver.  In some cases (e.g., due to
   network mobility or rerouting events) the impact might be somewhere
   along the path independent from the end points.

   If NSIS is used for E2E QoS signaling then the additional
   functionality is minimal since NSIS inter-working with mobility and
   multi-homing is required for NSIS and already provided.  For a
   discussion of the problems and the solutions the reader is referred
   to [I-D.ietf-nsis-applicability-mobility-signaling].  For a data
   sender there is no problem to trigger a new NSIS signaling exchange.
   The exchange is shown in the subsequent figure whereby only a single
   intermediate node is depicted for editorial reasons:


     MN                               Node        CN
   (Sender)                                  (Receiver)
       |                                |          |
       |           LPCI - QUERY         |          |
       +------------------------------->|  QUERY   |
       |                                +--------->|
       |                                | RESPONSE |
       |             RESPONSE           |<---------+
       |<-------------------------------+          |
       |                                |          |

   When the data sender (MN) roams or changes the interface then a LPCI
   QUERY message is sent to collect path characteristics.  When the data
   receiver (CN) receives the message it returns a RESPONSE message and
   thereby provides the learned path characteristics back to the MN.

   Due to routing asymmetry the same approach cannot be used by the data
   receiver when the problem is detected there first.  The message
   exchange then has to start with a trigger based on MIP or NSIS as
   shown in the following figure:

     MN                              Node        CN
   (Receiver)                                (Sender)
     |                                |          |
     |             NOTIFICATION       |          |
     |------------------------------------------>|
     |                                |          |
     |                                | QUERY    |
     |             LPCI - QUERY       |<---------+
     |<-------------------------------+          |
     |                                |          |
     |             RESPONSE           |          |
     +------------------------------->| RESPONSE |
     |                                +--------->|
     |                                |          |
     |                                |          |

   The first message aims to show a notification message that causes the
   data sender to initiate a LPCI QUERY message as shown in the previous
   message.

   Problems within the middle of the network are detected with period
   QUERY/RESPONSE message exchange.

   When QoS signaling is not desired, as in the case of LPCI exchange,
   then a new NSLP is needed.  The support for LPCI nodes can be
   incrementally deployed, starting in environments such as access
   networks and moving networks.  Such an NSIS LPCI NSLP can therefore
   consider path instead of only link characteristics resulting in a
   more robust solution.  Note that the LPCI QUERY / RESPONSE message
   exchange does not need to create state to be allocated at
   intermediate devices.

3.7.  TCP

   Transmission control protocol [RFC0793] guarantees reliable and in-
   order delivery of sender to receiver data.

   TCP session is set up via a three-way handshake, and packet order and
   reliability is maintained by sequence numbers and sliding window
   acknowledgements.  Congestion is handled via mechanisms such as slow
   start and explicit notifications.

   Since it's original introduction, TCP has been extended on multiple
   occasions, as the protocol provides a variable-length "options"
   field.  The options have been used to transmit such information as
   window scaling factor and timestamps for RTT measurements.  Adding a
   new option for LPCI is trivial.

Internet-Draft           LPCI Delivery Analysis             October 2006


   To lower information traversal, TCP's URG flag should be set for
   packets containing LPCI data, so that applications can react
   accordingly with minimal delay.

3.8.  DCCP

   The Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) [RFC4340]is a
   transport protocol that provides bidirectional unicast connections of
   congestion-controlled unreliable datagrams.  DCCP is intended for
   applications such as streaming media that can benefit from control
   over the tradeoffs between delay and reliable in-order delivery.
   DCCP does not contain support for mobility or multihoming anymore.
   Mobility and multihoming are now defined as an option in a separate
   document [I-D.kohler-dccp-mobility].  Each DCCP connection was
   associated with exactly two network-level addresses over its
   lifetime, one per endpoint.  There is one potential design for DCCP
   mobility and multihoming support.

   DCCP mobility and multihoming support is based on generalized
   connections.  A generalized connection groups one or more transport
   connections, called component connections, into a single application-
   level entity.  To move addresses, a host attaches a new component
   connection, then detaches the old component connection.  The first
   connection handshake in a generalized connection must register the
   intention to set up a generalized connection.  The generalized
   connection's identifier is then agreed upon by the two endpoints
   (assuming they both support mobility).  Thereafter, new component
   connections specify the intended generalized connection in their
   handshakes.

   Even though there is one potential mechanism for DCCP Mobility which
   makes a new component connection and destroys a old component
   connection with congestion control, it has many problems to guarantee
   quality-of-service, such as packet loss, jitter ,out of sequence
   packets and so on.  Mobile networks with many participants and poor
   network resources cause a DCCP packet delays.  This fact indicates
   that DCCP may not be satisfactory for LPCI delivery.

   DCCP is not currently in wide use.

3.9.  RTP/RTCP

   RTP protocol [RFC3550] provides end-to-end transport functions
   suitable for applications transmitting real-time data, such as audio
   and video, over multicast or unicast network services.  RTP does not
   address resource reservation and does not guarantee quality-of-
   service for real-time services.  RTP is augmented by a control
   protocol (RTCP) to monitor data delivery and network statistics.

   RTCP packets are transmitted periodically to all participants in the
   session to provide feedback on the quality of the data distribution
   as the form of Sender Report (SR) or Receiver Report (RR).  All
   participants send RTCP packets, therefore the interval of sending
   RTCP packet must be controlled in order for RTP to scale up to a
   large number of participants.  This is an integral part of the RTP's
   role as a transport protocol and is related to the flow and
   congestion control.

   Although RTCP resolves many of the problems in UDP network
   environment, such as lost packets, jitter, and out of sequence
   packets, it that reports conditions of session periodically may have
   difficulty to guarantee quality-of-service immediately.  Mobile
   environments with many participants and low bandwidth may cause the
   long interval of RTCP transmission (e.g., five, six seconds or more).
   Although there is more immediate RTCP feedback (defined in 'Extended
   RTP profile for RTCP-based Feedback'), RTCP feedback message is heavy
   to send LPCI.  As RTCP feedback message is added the end of normal
   RTCP packet, it may send unnecessary information in addition to the
   LPCI.  Moreover, RTCP feedback message is hard to respond immediately
   when the receiver is in the large group.  The previously discussed
   issues are more a problem of RTP itself with a large receiver group
   than a LPCI specific issue.  Therefore, RTP and RTCP might not be
   appropriate for the LPCI delivery without resolving above problems
   first, late and inefficient Link and Path Characteristic Information
   delivery.

3.10.  SCTP

   SCTP [RFC2960] is a general-purpose transport layer protocol.  SCTP
   provides features such as multi-streaming and multi-homing that may
   be helpful in mobility environment.

   SCTP's current multi-homing allows two end-points to set up an
   association with multiple IP address for each endpoint.
   Retransmission of lost packets can be done over the secondary path.
   Mobile SCTP is able to provide a solution for limited mobility
   scenarios as well.  A multi-access user would be able to roam between
   heterogeneous access networks without breaking any existing
   connections.  A new connection for the same session can be
   initialized with separate parameters (congestion window size, MTU
   ,etc.)

   As SCTP originally does not provide QoS support, extensions may be
   needed for expedited LPCI delivery.  It should be able to implement
   LPCI delivery by extending ASCONF chunk message for dynamic address
   configuration or by making suggestion of new chunk.  SCTP is not
   currently in wide use.

   [1] Load depends of implementation option handling.  Options have to
   be examined at every node on the path, except in the case of IPv6
   Destination Options.

   [2] NAT's and firewalls generally handle traversal based on 4-tuple
   of IP addresses and source and destination ports.  Also, IPv4 headers
   may be removed at the intermediate nodes due to lack of
   classification between end-to-end and hop-by-hop options.

   [3] SIP traverses through firewalls, but the session that will be set

   up as a follow-up requires explicit support from the firewall (SIP
   ALG) or other mechanisms, such as STUN.

   [4] Delegation via SIP proxies or other mechanisms possible.

   [5] MIP supports multiple care-of-addresses.

   [6] Preregistering new care-of-address before deregistering the next
   allows for seamless handovers.  The new care-of-address registration
   can contain new LPCI values.

   [7] Explicit messages for ONLY the LPCI data increases signaling
   load; If LPCI data can be bundled with other (necessary) signaling,
   load increase is minimal.

   [8] RTCP message sending delay may grow too large for the information
   to lose it's significance.  Using explicit notifications contradicts
   R5.

   [9] Protocol is relatively new, so support in firewalls and NAT
   equipment is still emerging and not widely available.

   [10] NSIS as an out-of-band mechanism is naturally more heavy-weight
   than an in-band mechanism.  The total amount of overhead depends,
   however, on a number of factors.  Details can be determined from
   [nsis-performance-paper].

   [11] NSIS needs to be triggered at the new point of attachment while
   the mobile node is still at the old point of attachment.  This is
   possible in a mobility environment but introduces complexity.


5.  Conclusions

5.1.  Results of the Analysis

   The results of the analysis are that most of the protocols can
   technically transport the LPCI attributes; i.e. they have a freely-
   definable option-field or similar structure.  However, other
   constraints may impact feasibility of individual protocols.

   The primary concern is that the LCI information should not cause too
   much additional signaling load to the network, and the information
   should still be of value upon reaching destination.  Most transport
   protocols implement some sort of congestion and flow control, which
   will cause delay in sending LPCI information 'bundled' with normal
   flow of information.  On the other hand, explicit notification
   mechanisms will increase load significantly.  For example, a single

Internet-Draft           LPCI Delivery Analysis             October 2006


   option field in a TCP acknowledgement packet increases the load with
   a few bytes; but an explicit notification in a separate IP packet
   (such as the RTP notification mechanism) will require an entire
   additional packet to be constructed and sent.

5.2.  Recommendations for the Information Delivery

   The most problematic situation is a break-before-make handover from a
   high-speed link to low-speed link.  If high bandwidth is available,
   the additional load caused by explicit notifications are not such a
   significant issue; even in a make-before-break situation (predictive
   handover) most of the additional load can be sent on the high-speed
   link before the handover occurs.

   After such a handover, the following recommendations can be made:

   o  Use a delegation mechanism, if possible, such as Mobile IP Home
      agent to make the notifications to peer nodes, to avoid extra load
      on the final link.
   o  If delegation is not possible, include the LCI data inside
      standard session packets, such as TCP acknowledgements (packets
      that would be sent regardless) or Mobile IP path optimization
      binding update.
   o  Have peers reuse the information; If having multiple sessions with
      a single host, send the LCI information only once and have it
      concern all the sessions.

   The LPCI delivery solution SHOULD be a generic container that can be
   transferred over any transport protocol.  Individual transport
   protocols MAY use protocol-specific derivations for eg. data
   compression, but such specifics are beyond the scope of this
   document.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require actions by IANA.


7.  Security Considerations

   Security requirements for the delivery of LPCI have been mentioned in
   [I-D.korhonen-mobopts-link-characteristics-ps].  This document lists
   a number of candidate protocols whereby each protocol offers
   different security properties.  A security analysis has to be
   provided for each protocol.
