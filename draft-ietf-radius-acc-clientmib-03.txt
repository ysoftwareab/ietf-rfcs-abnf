3.  Abstract

This memo defines a set of extensions which instrument RADIUS accounting
client functions. These extensions represent a portion of the Management
Information  Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the
Internet community.  Using these extensions IP-based management stations
can manage RADIUS accounting clients.

4.  Introduction

This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for
use with network management protocols in  the  Internet  community.   In
particular,  it  describes  managed  objects  used  for  managing RADIUS
accounting clients.

Today a wide range of network devices, including routers and NASes,  act
as  RADIUS  accounting  clients in order to provide accounting services.
As a result, the effective management of RADIUS accounting clients is of
considerable importance.


5.  The SNMP Management Framework

The   SNMP   Management  Framework  presently  consists  of  five  major
components:

    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2271 [1].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for  the
        purpose  of  management.  The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1  and  described  in
        RFC 1155 [2], RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The second version,
        called SMIv2, is described in RFC 1902 [5], RFC 1903 [6] and RFC
        1904 [7].

    o   Message  protocols  for transferring management information. The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1  and
        described  in RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP message
        protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol,  is
        called  SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC 1906 [10].
        The third version of the message protocol is called  SNMPv3  and
        described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2272 [11] and RFC 2274 [12].

    o   Protocol  operations  for  accessing management information. The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU  formats  is
        described  in  RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol operations
        and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [13].

    o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2273 [14] and
        the  view-based  access  control mechanism described in RFC 2275
        [15].

Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the
Management  Information  Base  or  MIB.   Objects in the MIB are defined
using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

INTERNET-DRAFT        RADIUS Accounting Client MIB       2 February 1999


This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A  MIB
conforming   to  the  SMIv1  can  be  poduced  through  the  appropriate
translations.  The  resulting  translated  MIB  must   be   semantically
equivalent,  except  where  objects  or  events  are  omitted because no
translation is  possible  (use  of  Counter64).  Some  machine  readable
information  in  SMIv2  will  be  converted into textual descriptions in
SMIv1 during the translation process.  However,  this  loss  of  machine
readable  information  is  not considered to change the semantics of the
MIB.


6.  Overview

The RADIUS accounting protocol, described in [16], distinguishes between
the  client  function  and  the  server  function. In RADIUS accounting,
clients send Accounting-Requests, and  servers  reply  with  Accounting-
Responses. Typically NAS devices implement the client function, and thus
would be expected to implement the RADIUS accounting client  MIB,  while
RADIUS  accounting  servers implement the server function, and thus woud
be expected o implement the RADIUS accounting server MIB.

However, it is possible for a RADIUS accounting entity to  perform  both
client  and  server  functions. For example, a RADIUS proxy may act as a
server to one or more RADIUS accounting  clients,  while  simultaneously
acting  as  an  accounting client to one or more accounting servers.  In
such situations, it is expected that RADIUS  entities  combining  client
and server functionality will support both the client and server MIBs.


6.1.  Selected objects
This MIB module contains two scalars as well as a single table:

(1)  the RADIUS Accounting Server Table contains one row for each
     RADIUS server that the client shares a secret with.

Each  entry  in  the  RADIUS  Accounting  Server Table includes thirteen
columns presenting a view of the activity of the RADIUS client.

9.  Security considerations

There  are  no  management  objects defined in this MIB that have a MAX-
ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.   So,  if  this  MIB  is
implemented  correctly, then there is no risk that an intruder can alter
or create any management  objects  of  this  MIB  via  direct  SNMP  SET
opertions.

There  are  a  number  of  managed  objects in this MIB that may contain
sensitive information. These are:

radiusAccServerAddress
          This can be used  to  determine  the  address  of  the  RADIUS
          accounting server with which the client is communicating. This
          information could be useful  in  mounting  an  attack  on  the
          acounting  server, which may contain sensitive financial data.

radiusAccClientServerPortNumber
          This can be used to determine the port  number  on  which  the
          RADIUS accounting client is sending. This information could be
          useful in impersonating the client in order to send fraudulent
          data to the accounting server.

It  is  thus  important  to control even GET access to these objects and
possibly to even encrypt the values of these object  when  sending  them
over  the  network  via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP provide features

for such a secure environment.

SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment. Even if the network itself
is secure (for example by using IPSec), there is no control as to who on
the   secure   network   is    allowed    to    access    and    GET/SET
(read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

It  is  recommended that the implementers consider the security features
as provided by the SNMPv3 framework. Specifically, the use of the  User-
based  Security  Model  RFC  2274 [12] and the View-based Access Control
Model RFC 2275 [15] is  recommended.   Using  these  security  features,
customer/users  can  give access to the objects only to those principals
(users) that have legitimate rights to GET or SET (change/create/delete)
them.
