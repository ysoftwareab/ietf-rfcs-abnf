Internet-Draft               MANET Link Type                October 2008


1.  Introduction

   A Mobile Ad hoc NETwork, or MANET, is commonly described as a loosely
   connected set of routers with no predetermined infrastructure and
   where the routers discover and maintain, even when faced with
   dynamically changing topologies, a routing structure.  Neither the
   set of routers in the MANET nor their connections to each other can
   be assumed to be pre-determined nor to be known in advance; either
   may change randomly over the lifetime of the MANET.

   MANETs are often constructed from routers using wireless broadcast
   interfaces, such as IEEE 802.11 interfaces in ad hoc mode, in order
   to establish connectivity among each other.  Other network interfaces
   and link types, such as Ethernet or point-top-point IP over IP
   tunnels, are occasionally present between routers in a MANET, and are
   then also used by MANET protocols, such as a MANET routing protocols
   (e.g.  [RFC3626], [RFC3561], [RFC4728], [RFC3684]) calculating
   routing paths.

   This presents MANET protocols with the challenge of operating not
   only over well known link types such as an Ethernet or a point-to-
   point IP over IP tunnel, but also to over links as formed over
   wireless broadcast interfaces.

   The purpose of this document is to describe a MANET Link Type which
   accommodates both, such that a protocol designed for the MANET Link
   Type will operate correctly both when presented with e.g. "an
   Ethernet" or with "a wireless broadcast interface".

2.  Terminology

   Neighbor -  a router B is a neighbor of a router A if B can receive
      communication directly from router A, without passing through any
      intermediates at the same layer (i.e. an IP router).

   Wireless broadcast interface -  a network interface where the medium
      supports true broadcast transmissions, and where link layer
      messages can be either multicast or unicast.  The transmission
      reachability is constrained by the radio range of the
      transmittter, which can be time-varying.

   Node -  any device (router or host) that implements IP.

   Router -  a node that forwards IP packets not explicitly addressed to
      itself.

Internet-Draft               MANET Link Type                October 2008


   MANET Router -  a router which has, at least, one MANET interface
      towards a link of the MANET Link Type, as described in this
      document, and which is capable of ensuring correct operation over
      that link.

   Host -  any node that is not a router, i.e. a host does not forward
      packets addressed to others.  A Host runs a standard IP stack, and
      is subject to no MANET Link specific assumptions.

   MANET Link -  a link of the MANET Link type, as described in this
      document.

3.  The MANET Router

   The entities that are concerned by the MANET Link Type described in
   this document are MANET routers.  A MANET Router is a router which
   has at least one, but possibly more, MANET interfaces, and zero or
   more interfaces of other types and towards other networks, as
   illustrated in Figure 1.

                          Figure 1: MANET Router

   MANET interfaces are the only interfaces which are exposed to links
   of the MANET Link Type, as described in this document.  Protocols
   operating directly over these MANET interfaces are, therefore, the
   only protocols which are required to be aware of the characteristics
   of the MANET Link Type.

   This entails that protocols which are not intended to operate over
   MANET interfaces are not required to be able to handle the
   characteristics of the MANET Link Type.

   In particular, any node connected to a MANET router over an interface
   other than a MANET interface, will see the MANET router as it would

   see any other IP router.  For example, in Figure 2 the hosts
   connected to the MANET router via the Ethernet link will simply
   perceive an Ethernet link with hosts and a router, oblivious to if
   the router is a MANET router or not.

             Figure 2: MANET Router with Hosts on an Ethernet

   Isolated by an IP hop, hosts on the Ethernet link in Figure 2 are not
   exposed to the particularities of the MANET Link Type - similarly to
   how, say, hosts on an Ethernet connected to an OSPF router with NBMA
   interfaces are not exposed to the particularities of the NBMA Link
   Type.

4.  MANET Interfaces

   An interface is, according to [RFC4862], "a node's attachment to a
   link", indicating that an interface is a unique point of attachment
   to a single link.  It therefore follows that a MANET interface is a
   MANET routers point of attachment to a MANET Link.

   A MANET interface is often a wireless broadcast interface, as
   illustrated in Figure 3, in which 5 MANET interfaces are connected to
   the same MANET link and form a simple MANET.  If these MANET
   interfaces are wireless broadcast interfaces, their transmission
   range is limited, as indicated.

               Figure 3: MANET Interface Transmission Ranges

   In this simple network, a transmission by the node C reaches only
   nodes B and D on the MANET link, due to the limited transmission
   range of the wireless broadcast interface.  Similarly, a transmission
   from node B reaches only nodes A and C and a transmission by node D
   reaches only node E - the latter might be due to environmental
   interference or obstacles, transmission power levels or antenna
   properties of node C or D (e.g. directional antennas on either or
   both of C and D).

   Note that the "Ethernet-like" interface characteristics that are
   usually assumed, where all Ethernet interfaces on the same link can
   reach each other, is a special case of this; and an Ethernet
   interface would be a perfectly acceptable MANET interface.

   This example in Figure 3 exhibits some of the characteristics of a
   MANET Link: connectivity on a link can not be assumed to be
   symmetric, nor can it be assumed to be transitive.  These MANET Link
   Type characteristics are detailed in Section 6.

5.  MANET Network Dynamics

   In a MANET, the set of participating MANET routers may change,
   possibly frequently, over time, as can the relative position of the
   MANET routers change as the network evolves.  More specifically, the
   set of MANET interfaces attached to a given MANET Link may change
   over time, and a MANET interface may change its position on a MANET
   Link, which may change the set of neighbors of that MANET interface.
   The simple network in Figure 3 may evolve over time, as illustrated
   in Figure 4, where at time t1 node A disappears from the MANET Link
   and node C and D moves out of radio range from each other and are no
   longer able to communicate.  At time t2, node F appears on the MANET
   Link, at a position where nodes C and D are within its radio range.

   The set of MANET interfaces which can be reached by a transmission
   from any MANET interface on the MANET Link may therefore also change
   over time.  In particular, the ability for a MANET interface to
   receive a transmission from another MANET interface on the same MANET

6.  The MANET Link Type

   [Thaler] enumerates a set of properties, which are commonly assumed
   by applications and upper layer protocols, and notes that these
   assumptions are becoming increasingly less true.  The MANET Link Type
   is an example of a Link Type which challenges these assumptions.

   The MANET Link Type characteristics can be summarized as follows:

   o  connectivity can not be assumed to be symmetric within a MANET
      Link;

   o  connectivity can not be assumed to be transitive within a MANET
      Link;

   o  connectivity can not be assumed to be continuous within a MANET
      Link;

   o  the point of attachment to a MANET Link determines the view of
      that MANET link;

   o  multicast and broadcast can not be assumed to work across a MANET
      Link;

   o  a subnet is smaller than a MANET Link;

   o  addresses can not be assumed to be part of an on-link subnet on a
      MANET Link.

   It is important to note that the MANET Link Type is non-prescriptive,
   i.e. it does not *require* a link to have these characteristics in
   order for MANET protocols to operate correctly over it, however
   protocols designed for the MANET Link Type are *required* to be able
   to operate correctly also when presented with these link
   characteristics.

   This, in particular, entails that for example an Ethernet would be
   perfectly acceptable as a MANET Link and that MANET protocols would
   operate correctly when presented with an Ethernet.

6.1.  Connectivity: Symmetry, Transitivity, Continouity ?

   As indicated in Section 4, MANET interfaces on a MANET Link may not
   all be neighbors, i.e. may not be able to communicate directly
   between each other without intermediate retransmissions,
   specifically:

Internet-Draft               MANET Link Type                October 2008


   o  node A being a neighbor of node B does not necessarily imply that
      node B is also a neighbor of node A;

   o  node A being a neighbor of nodes B and C does not necessarily
      imply that nodes B and C are neighbors.

   Furthermore, as indicated in Section 5, neighbors may change over,
   specifically:

   o  the ability for a MANET interface to receive a transmission from
      another MANET interface on the same MANET Link and at a given
      point in time does not necessarily indicate that such is also
      possible in the future.

6.2.  Subnet Model and Addresses

   [Thaler] observes that "a subnet is smaller than, or equal to a
   link", specifically that "destinations with addresses in the same
   subnet can be reached with TTL (or Hop Count) = 1".  On a MANET Link,
   a transmission with TTL (or Hop Count) = 1 can be received only by
   MANET interfaces which are neighbors of the sending MANET interface.

   The first observation is, that "subnet", "reachability without
   decrementing TTL" and "addresses within a subnet" are intimately
   related, and assume that "all interfaces with addresses within the
   same subnet are neighbors".

            -------+-------     ---+-------             Transmission

         | A |   | B |   | C |   | D |   | E |
         +---+   +---+   +---+   +---+   +---+

                     Figure 5: MANET Subnet Challenge

   Considering node C on the MANET Link as depicted in Figure 5, this
   router can reach the MANET interfaces of node B and D in a single
   transmission and with a TTL (or Hop Count) = 1.  Nodes B, C and D
   could, therefore, be candidates for belonging to the same subnet.
   However a transmission by node B can not reach node D without being
   retransmitted by node C and so a transmission from node B with a TTL
   (or Hop Count) = 1 will not reach node D. Furthermore, due to the
   limited transmission range of node D, node D can reach neither of
   nodes B and C -- and so, nodes B, C and D can not belong to the same
   subnet.

Internet-Draft               MANET Link Type                October 2008


   This leads to the second observation, that the only set of addresses
   which on a MANET Link can be guaranteed reachable in a single
   transmission with TTL (or Hop count) = 1 are those of the
   transmitting interface.  The only addresses which can belong to the
   same subnet on a MANET Link are, therefore, the addresses assigned to
   the same MANET interface.

   While the MANET interfaces of nodes B and C in Figure 5 may not be
   configured with addresses from within the same subnet, these may
   still communicate e.g. as point-to-point links where the two
   endpoints have addresses from unrelated address spaces.

6.3.  Multicast and Broadcast Scopes

   IPv4 Limited Broadcast (255.255.255.255) and IPv4 and IPv6 Link Local
   Multicast (FFx2::) are specified to not be forwarded [RFC3927]
   [RFC4291] [RFC3330].  As a consequence, on a MANET Link:

   o  the scope within which a Limited Broadcast or a Link Local
      Multicast transmission can be received is limited to that of the
      transmitting MANET interface and its neighbors.

   In other words, the broadcast and link local multicast scope of a
   MANET interface on a MANET Link is the MANET interfaces which are
   within transmission range.  In figure Figure 6, the broadcast and
   multicast scope of node C is, as indicated, the MANET interfaces of
   nodes B and D; the broadcast and multicast scope of node D is the
   MANET interface of node E.

               Figure 6: MANET Broadcast and Multicast Scope

   Symmetrically, a broadcast or a link local multicast can be received
   by any MANET interface within transmission range of the transmitter,
   whether those are the receivers intended or not.  Due to the fact
   that connectivity can not be assumed to be symmetric, the transmitter
   may not a priori know which MANET interfaces have received the
   broadcast or link local multicast, nor can it be assumed that the
   recipients a posteriori can signal that they received the broadcast
   or link local multicast.

7.  The MANET Addressing Architecture

   This section presents an addressing architecture model for MANETs,
   which preserves the integrity of the conventional IP addressing
   architecture while allowing for the particularities of the MANET Link
   Type.  In particular, the applications and protocols running on hosts
   are not exposed to a MANET Link.  Only MANET interfaces of MANET
   routers are required to be aware of the MANET Link Type, and to be
   configured according to the characteristics of the MANET Link Type.

   A MANET router is a router with at least one MANET interface towards
   a MANET Link and, possibly, with zero or more other interfaces
   towards other routers or hosts.  The MANET router may, as any router
   be delegated zero or more prefixes, which it may assign, integrally
   or as subnet prefixes, to any links of its non-MANET interfaces,
   which are configured accordingly.  Hosts and routers on these non-
   MANET interfaces may be assigned addresses from within these prefixes
   according to the address (auto)configuration mechanisms governing
   these (non-MANET) links, such as [RFC4862] and [RFC2131].

   Considering the example in Figure 7, the MANET router is delegated
   the prefix p::/48.  Subnet-prefixes p:1::/62, p:2::/62 and p:3::/63

                Figure 7: MANET Router and Prefixes Example

   The configuration of MANET interface(s) of the MANET router requires
   special attention, and is detailed in Section 7.1.

7.1.  MANET Interface Configuration

   As described in Section 6.2, on a MANET Link the only addresses which
   can be guaranteed to be reachable with TTL (or Hop Count) = 1, and
   therefore can be admitted to be within the same subnet, are the
   addresses assigned to the sending MANET interface.  Consequently,
   MANET interfaces must be configured such that:

   o  no two MANET interfaces appear within the same subnet, i.e. with
      the same prefix and prefix length.

   This can be, and is commonly, accomplished by configuring MANET
   interfaces with a /32 (IPv4) or a /128 (IPv6) address, e.g. as an
   unnumbered interface, borrowing a single IP address from a non-MANET
   interface of the MANET router.

   It is worth noting that prefix lengths shorter than /128 (IPv6) or
   /32 (IPv4) are possible on MANET interfaces, as long as the prefixes
   are unique to a single MANET interface.  Note that the above
   statements are not an exception, but simply a clarification that
   MANET are no different from other networks in this respect.

7.2.  MANET Addressing Architecture Characteristics

   The MANET addressing architecture presented in this section makes a
   clear separation between the role of MANET router and host in a
   MANET, recognizing that:

   o  MANET Link Type characteristics are only exposed to MANET
      interfaces of MANET-aware routers, running appropriate protocols;

   o  routers and hosts, and more generally networks/subnets, on non-
      MANET interface(s) are not subject to the particularities of the
      MANET Link Type but are isolated herefrom by an IP hop;

   o  applications and protocols on hosts and routers, and more
      generally networks/subnets, on non-MANET interfaces run
      unmodified.

   Note that this addressing architecture is similar to how routing in
   the existing Internet is structured.  Routers run their routing
   protocol over router interconnects with various characteristics to
   which only the routing protocols are privy.  On the other hand, hosts
