Abstract


   This memo requests a change of the status of RFC 954, "NICNAME/WHOIS"
   to Historic.

1. Introduction

   The NICNAME/WHOIS [1] protocol, a TCP transaction based
   query/response protocol, and server [2], ran on a host located at SRI
   International.  It was one of a series of internet services
   maintained by the DDN Network Information Center (NIC) at SRI
   International on behalf of the Defense Communications Agency (DCA).

Internet-Draft Request to Move RFC 954 to Historic Status September 2002


   This service provided DDN-network-wide directory service to internet
   users, via user programs running on local hosts, and delivered the
   full name, U.S.  mailing address, telephone number, and  network
   mailbox for DDN users who were registered in the NIC database.

2. Action

   Since the Defense Communications Agency (DCA) no longer contracts to
   SRI International to operate the DDN Network Information Center (NIC)
   at SRI International on its behalf, and the ARPANET was retired in
   1990, and all DDN services terminated in 1995, MILNET included, the
   IESG is moving RFC 954 to Historic status.

3. Security Considerations

   Moving RFC 954 to historic ends the application of DCA user data
   disclosure practices (unrestricted) to non-DCA Network Information
   Centers.  Unrestricted access to NIC user registration data is a
   significant cause of limited user trust in network security, hence in
   a trustable network.  Unrestricted access to NIC user registration
   data gives rise to excessive load on NIC user registration data
   services, excessive load on mail relays via unsolicited bulk email,
   and related abuses.
