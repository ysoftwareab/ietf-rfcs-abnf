Internet-Draft  Explicit AS_PATH Attribute for BGP Update  February 2010


1.  Introduction

   This document describes a extension of BGP for controlling the area
   where UPDATE messages are propagated.  For this purpose, this
   document defines a new path attribute, explicit AS_PATH Attribute.

   An UPDATE message with explicit AS_PATH attribute passes over the
   path specified the attribute.  By including this attribute in UPDATE
   message, the originating BGP speaker can restrict the area where
   UPDATE messages are propagated.


2.  Explicit AS_PATH Attribute

   The Explicit AS_PATH Attribute is a transitive optional BGP
   attribute.  The type code of this attribute is assigned by IANA.

                Figure 1: Explicit AS_PATH Attribute Format

   o  Previous-hop AS : The previous-hop AS is a 4-octet length field,
      containing the 4-octet AS number[3] of the previous hop.

   o  Explicit path Length : The explicit path length is a 1-octet
      length field, containing the number of ASes (not the number of
      octets) in the explicit ASes field.

   o  Explicit ASes : The explicit ASes field contains one or more
      4-octet AS numbers[3], each encoded as a 4-octet length field.

2.2.  Handling Processes

2.2.1.  Originating UPDATE message with Explicit AS_PATH

   When a BGP speaker originates an UPDATE message then, the originating
   speaker MAY append an explicit AS_PATH Attribute to UPDATE message.
   This explicit AS_PATH Attribute contains its own AS number in the
   previous-hop AS field, sequence of explicit AS numbers in the
   explicit ASes field and the number of explicit ASes in the explicit
   path length filed.

2.2.2.  Receiving UPDATE message with Explicit AS_PATH

   When a BGP speaker receives an UPDATE message from an external peer,
   the receiving speaker handles the UPDATE message as follows:

   a.  if the value of Previous-hop AS is not same as the AS number of
       the external peer, the receiving speaker MUST discard the UPDATE
       message.

   b.  if the value of the first entry in Explicit ASes is not same as
       the AS number of the receiving speaker, the receiving speaker
       MUST discard the UPDATE message.

   c.  if the UPDATE message has not been discarded by the above
       conditions, the receiving speaker MUST remove the first entry
       from Explicit ASes and MUST update the value of Explicit path
       Length.  The receiving speaker MUST apply a route advertised by
       the UPDATE message to the BGP decision process (see section 9.1
       in [2]).

   When a BGP speaker receives an UPDATE message from an internal peer,
   the receiving speaker MUST apply a route advertised by the UPDATE
   message to the BGP decision process [2].

2.2.3.  Sending UPDATE message with Explicit AS_PATH

   When a BGP speaker attempts to send an UPDATE message to an external
   peer, the sending speaker handles the UPDATE message as follows:

   a.  if the value of the first entry in Explicit ASes is not same as
       the AS number of the external peer, the speaker MUST NOT send the
       UPDATE message to the external peer.

   b.  if the value of the first entry in Explicit ASes is same as the
       AS number of the external peer, the speaker MAY send the UPDATE
       message to the external peer.

Internet-Draft  Explicit AS_PATH Attribute for BGP Update  February 2010


   If a peer to which a BGP speaker attempts to send an UPDATE message
   is an internal peer, the speaker MUST send the UPDATE message to the
   internal peer.


3.  IANA Considerations

   This document introduces a new path attribute of BGP.  The type code
   of this attribute has to be assigned from the registry of BGP Path
   Attributes maintained by IANA.


4.  Security Considerations

   RFC4271 [2] discusses security considerations concerning BGP.  This
   document describes only a extension for BGP, and so those
   considerations apply to this extension, too.  There are no known
   additional security concerns for this extension.

   Communications, Japan.
