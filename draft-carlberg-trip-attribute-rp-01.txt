Abstract

   This document defines a new attribute for  the  TRIP  protocol.   The
   attribute   associates   protocols/services   in  the  PSTN  offering
   authorized  prioritization  during  call  setup  that  are  reachable
   through  a TRIP gateway.  Current examples of preferential service in
   the PSTN are Government Emergency Telecommunications  Service  (GETS)
   in  the U.S. and Government Telephone Preference Scheme (GTPS) in the
   U.K.  The proposed attribute for TRIP is based on the NameSpace.Value
   tupple defined for the SIP resource Priority field.

1.  Introduction

   An IP telephony gateway allows  nodes  on  an  IP  based  network  to
   communicate  with  other  entities  on the circuit switched telephone
   network.  The Telephony Routing over  IP  (TRIP)  protocol  [rfc3219]
   provides  a  way  for  nodes  on  the IP network to locate a suitable
   gateway through the use of Location Servers.  TRIP is a policy driven
   inter-administrative    domain    protocol    for   advertising   the
   reachability, negotiate capabilities, and  specify  attributes  about
   these gateways.

   The TRIP protocol is modeled after BGP-4  [rfc1771]  and  uses  path-
   vector  advertisements distributed in a hop-by-hop manner (resembling
   a  Bellman-Ford  routing  algorithm)  via  Location  Servers.   These
   Location  Servers  are grouped in administrative clusters known as an
   Internet Telephony Administrative Domains (ITAD).  A  more  extensive
   framework discussion on TRIP can be found in [rfc2871].

   This document defines a new attribute to  be  registered  with  IANA.
   The  purpose  of  this  new  attribute,  and the rationale behind its
   specification, is explained in the following sections.


2.  Emergency Telecommunications Service

   Emergency Telecommunications Service is a broad term that  refers  to
   the   services   provided   by  systems  used  to  support  emergency
   communications.  One example of these systems is the U.S.  Government
   Emergency  Telecommunications  System  (GETS).  This system currently
   operates over the U.S. Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) as  a
   pay-per-use  system by authorized personnel.  It uses the T1.631-1993
   ANSI standard [ANSI] to signal the presence of the National  Security
   /  Emergency  Preparedness  code  point  in  an ISDN User Part (ISUP)
   Initial Address Message (IAM) for SS7.  A key aspect of GETS is  that
   a  signaling  standard  in  the  U.S.  PSTN  is  used  to  convey the
   activation/request of the GETS service.

   From a protocol perspective, other examples of  priority  (and  which
   can  be  argued  as  emergency/disaster  related)  standards  are the
   H.460.4 ITU [itu460] standard on Call Priority designation for  H.323
   calls,   and   the  I.255.3  [itu255]  ITU  standard  on  Multi-Level
   Precedence and Preemption Service.  The latter  has  been  integrated
   into   private  telephony  systems  like  AUTOVON.   In  both  cases,
   signaling  code-points  exist  to  distinguish  telephony  calls   by
   authenticated and prioritized end-user from the normal end-user.  The
   form of this distinction varies and is  outside  the  scope  of  this
   document.  [rfc3689] and [rfc3690] provides additional information on
   ETS and  its  requirements  from  the  perspective  of  the  Internet

   Emergency Preparedness (IEPREP) working group of the IETF.

3.  SIP Resource-Priority Effort

   The  initial  discussions  in  the  IEPREP  list,  along   with   the
   presentation   at   the   Adelaide-IETF  [ADEL00],  led  to  strawman
   requirements to augment SIP to have the ability  to  prioritize  call
   signaling.   This  effort  was  then advanced formally in the SIPPING
   working group so that SIP would  be  able  to  prioritize  access  to
   circuit-switched  networks,  end  system,  and  proxy  resources  for
   emergency preparedness communication [rfc3487].

   The requirements in [rfc3487]  produced  the  corresponding  document
   [rfc4412]  in  the  SIP working group, which defines a new header for
   SIP called Resource-Priority.  This new header, which is optional, is
   divided  into two parts: a NameSpace and a Value.  The NameSpace part
   uniquely identifies a group of one or  more  priorities.   The  Value
   part identifies one of a set of priorities used for a SIP message.

3.1  Benefits

   There are three basic benefits  derived  from  the  addition  of  the
   Resource  Priority  header in SIP.  The first is an ability to signal
   the priority within a SIP message to other entities in an IP network.
   The  caveat  is  that  some  entities  may  not recognize/support the
   priority or namespace,  but  at  least  the  ability  to  signal  the
   priority  with  respect  to  resources  has been specified in the SIP
   protocol.

   The second benefit is that telephony related protocol/codepoints from
   other  standards  can have a corresponding mapping to SIP NameSpace &
   Value tokens its the Resource-Priority header.   Hence,  the  current
   NS/EP   codepoint   in   ANSI   standard  T1.631-1993  could  have  a
   corresponding NameSpace.Value token set for the IETF standards  body.
   And  as  a  result,  this  mapping  would  facilitate the transparent
   bridging of signals (i.e., code points) between standards defined  by
   various organizations -- be they private or public.

   The third benefit of the Resource Priority header, and its definition
   of  alphanumeric  tokens,  is  that  it  is  highly  versatile.   The
   NameSpace allows for wide  set  of  priorities  to  be  defined,  and
   updated  if the need arises by simply defining a new NameSpace token.
   Hence, there is no reliance on a single set of priorities applied for
   all cases.

3.2  Issue

   Having defined a means of signaling priority  through  gateways,  the

   follow  on  question  arises of how does one determine which gateways
   support a  given  NameSpace.   The  dissemination  of  this  type  of
   information  is  within  the  scope  of  TRIP.   However, the current
   specification of TRIP does not include a  component  that  advertises
   associations  of  gateways with specific NameSpaces.  To address this
   omission, the following section defines a  new  TRIP  attribute  that
   associates one or more NameSpaces with a gateway.

4.  New Attribute: ResourcePriority

   This section provides details on the  syntax  and  semantics  of  the
   ResourcePriority  TRIP attribute.  Its presentation reflects the form
   of existing attributes presented in Section 5 of [rfc3219].

   Attribute Flags, whose field is shown in Figure 3 above, are  set  to
   the following:

      Conditional Mandatory: False
      Required Flags: Not Well-Known, Independent Transitive
      Potential Flags: None
      TRIP Type Code: TBD  (proposed to be 12)

   There are no  dependencies  on  other  attributes,  thus  Conditional
   Mandatory is set to "False".

   Since the Resource-Priority field  in  SIP,  with  its  corresponding
   NameSpace  Token, is optional, the ResourcePriority Attribute in TRIP
   is also optional.  Hence, it is set to "Not Well-Known".

   The Independent Transitive condition indicates that the attribute  is
   to be forwarded amongst all ITADs.  The Location Server that does not
   recognize the attribute sets the Partial flag as well.


4.1  Syntax of ResourcePriority

   The ResourcePriority attribute contains one or more  NameSpace  token
   identifiers.  An initial set of identifiers are defined in [rfc4412],
   with subsequent identifiers to be found in the  IANA  registry.   The
   syntax   of   the  ResourcePriority  attribute  is  copied  from  the
   "namespace" token syntax from [rfc4412], and is an alphanumeric value
   as shown below:

   namespace = 1*( alphanum / "-" / "!" / "%" / "*" / "_" / "+"
                   / "`" / "'" / "~" )


   Since NameSpaces are arbitrary in length, each tuple  consists  of  a

Internet Drafts       Resource Priority Attribute            April, 2007


   Length  value  with  a  NameSpace  value  as shown in Figure 4 below.
   There is no padding between tuples.


    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +---------------+---------------+--------------+----------------+
   |        NameSpace Length       |   NameSpace Value (variable)  |
   +---------------+---------------+--------------+----------------+


   It is important to note that the priority (i.e.,  "r-priority"  token
   syntax) from [rfc4412] is NOT used in the ResourcePriority attribute.
   This is because the objective of the attribute is  to  advertise  the
   NameSpace associated with a gateway and not the individual priorities
   within that NameSpace.

4.2  Additional TRIP Considerations

   Section 5.12 of TRIP lists a number of considerations that should  be
   addressed   when   defining   new   attributes.    The   first  three
   considerations (use of the attribute, its  flags,  and  syntax)  have
   been discussed above in this section.  The final three considerations
   are:

4.2.1  Route Origination

   The ResourcePriority attribute is not well-known.  If a route  has  a
   ResourcePriority  attribute  associated  with it, the Location Server
   (LS) MUST include that attribute in the advertisement it originates.

4.2.2  Route Aggregation

   Routes with differing  ResourcePriority  token  values  MUST  NOT  be
   aggregated.    Routes   with   the   same   token   values   in   the
   ResourcePriority  attribute  MAY   be   aggregated   and   the   same
   ResourcePriority attribute attached to the aggregated object.

4.2.3  Route Dissemination and Attribute Scope

   An LS MUST include the ResourcePriority attribute when  communicating
   with peer LSs within its own domain.

   If received from a peer LS in another domain, an LS   MUST  propagate
   the ResourcePriority attribute to other LSs within its domain.

   An LS MAY add the ResourcePriority attribute when propagating routing
   objects   to   an  LS  in  another  domain.   The  inclusion  of  the

Internet Drafts       Resource Priority Attribute            April, 2007


   ResourcePriority  attribute  is  a  matter  of  local  administrative
   policy.


5  Security Considerations

   The document defines a new attribute for the TRIP protocol and has no
   direct  security considerations applied to it.  However, the security
   considerations for TRIP and its messages  remain  the  same  and  are
   articulated in Section 14 of [rfc3219].

6.  IANA Considerations

   As described in Section 4 above, one new "TRIP  attribute"  has  been
   defined.  Its name and code value are the following:

      Code                    Attribute Name
      ----                   ----------------
       TBD (suggest 12)      ResourcePriority

   These assignments are recorded in the following registry:
