Abstract
   This document modifies RFC 3978 "IETF Rights in Contributions" to
   recognize that the IETF Trust is now the proper custodian of all
   IETF-related intellectual property rights.

   This document does not constrain how the IETF Trust exercises those
   rights.

1. Introduction

Internet-Draft       RFC 3978 Update for IETF Trust            July 2006


1.1  IETF Trust

   Currently the IETF requires that authors of Contributions to the IETF
   grant to the IETF (meaning the full set of participants in the IETF
   Standards Process) a limited set of non-exclusive rights and
   permissions as part of the process of submitting such Contribution.
   These rights and permissions are detailed in "IETF Rights in
   Contributions" (RFC 3978 - BCP 78) [RFC3978].

   The IETF Trust was recently formed to act as the administrative
   custodian of all copyrights and other intellectual property rights
   relating to the IETF Standards Process that had previously been held
   by ISOC and CNRI (See [reference to IETF Trust Agreement]).  This
   document modifies RFC 3978 in order to implement this structure.
   Most importantly, it alters the license-grant path as follows:
   whereas previously authors of Contributions to the IETF would grant a
   license both to ISOC and to all IETF participants, it is now proposed
   that such authors grant a license to the IETF Trust (in Section 3.3).
   This document concerns itself only with changes to RFC 3978 needed to
   recognize the creation of the IETF Trust.

   This introductory section is to provide context for the reader.
   Section 2 of this document is intended to be normative.
