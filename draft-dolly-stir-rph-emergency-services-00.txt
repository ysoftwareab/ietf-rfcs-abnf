1.  Introduction

   Personal Assertion Token (PASSporT) Extension for Resource Priority
   Authorization [RFC8443] extended the Personal Assertion Token
   (PASSporT) specification defined in [RFC8225] to allow the inclusion
   of cryptographically signed assertions of authorization for the
   values populated in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) 'Resource-
   Priority' header field, which is used for communications resource
   prioritization.

   Compromise of the SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field [RFC4412]
   could lead to misuse of network resources (i.e., during congestion
   scenarios), impacting the application services supported using the
   SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field.

   [RFC8225] allows extensions by which an authority on the originating
   side verifying the authorization of a particular communication for
   the SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field can use a PASSPorT claim to
   cryptographically sign the SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field and
   convey assertion of the authorization for the SIP 'Resource-Priority'
   header field.  A signed SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field will
   allow a receiving entity (including entities located in different
   network domains/boundaries) to verify the validity of assertions
   authorizing the SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field and to act on
   the information with confidence that the information has not been
   spoofed or compromised.

   This document adds new assertion values for a Resource Priority
   Header ("rph") claim defined in [RFC8443], in support of Emergency
   Services Networks for emergency call origination and callback.  How
   these new assertion values for real-time communications supported
   using the SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field is outside the scope
   of this document.  In addition, the PASSPorT extension defined in
   this document is intended for use in environments where there are

   means to verify that the signer of the SIP 'Resource-Priority' header
   field is authoritative.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  New Assertion Values

   This specification defines new assertions values for:

   *   "ESorig": Emergency Services call origination
   *   "EScallback": Emergency Services callback.

   The following is an example of an "rph" claim for SIP 'Resource-
   Priority' header field with a "ESorig" assertion:

     {
       "orig":{"tn":"CgPN"},
       "dest":{["tn":"911 or URN-SOS"]},
       "iat":1443208345,
       "rph":{"ESorig":["esnet,x"]}
     }

   The following is an example of an "rph" claim for SIP 'Resource-
   Priority' header field with a "ESorig" assertion:

     {
       "orig":{"tn":"EmergNet Num"},
       "dest":{["tn":"CgPN that originated emergency call"]},
       "iat":1443208345,
       "rph":{"EScallback":["esnet,x"]}
     }

   After the header and claims PASSporT objects have been constructed,
   their signature is generated normally per the guidance in [RFC8225]
   using the full form of PASSPorT.  The credentials (i.e., Certificate)
   used to create the signature must have authority over the namespace
   of the "rph" claim, and there is only one authority per claim.  The
   authority MUST use its credentials associated with the specific
   service supported by the resource priority namespace in the claim.
   If r-values are added or dropped by the intermediaries along the
   path, the intermediaries must generate a new "rph" header and sign
   the claim with their own authority.

   The use of the compact form of PASSporT is not specified in this
   document.

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  PASSporT Resource Priority Header (rph) Types

   This specification requests that the IANA add two new assertion
   values to the "PASSporT Resource Priority Header (rph) Types"
   Registry as defined in [RFC8443].

   The following assertion values will be added to the registry:

   * "ESorig": Emergency Services call origination
   * "EScallback": Emergency Services callback

       +--------------+------------+
       | rph Type     | Reference  |
       +--------------+------------+
       | ESorig       | [this RFC] |
       +--------------+------------+
       | EScallback   | [this RFC] |
       +--------------+------------+

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations discussed in [RFC8224], Section 12, are
   applicable here.
