Internet-Draft      A Centralized Keystore Mechanism          March 2019


1.  Introduction

   This document defines a YANG 1.1 [RFC7950] module called "ietf-
   keystore" that enables centralized configuration of asymmetric keys
   and their associated certificates, and notification for when
   configured certificates are about to expire.

   This module also defines Six groupings designed for maximum reuse.
   These groupings include one for the public half of an asymmetric key,
   one for both the public and private halves of an asymmetric key, one
   for both halves of an asymmetric key and a list of associated
   certificates, one for an asymmetric key that may be configured
   locally or via a reference to an asymmetric key in the keystore, one
   for a trust anchor certificate and, lastly, one for an end entity
   certificate.

   Special consideration has been given for systems that have
   cryptographic hardware, such as a Trusted Protection Module (TPM).
   These systems are unique in that the cryptographic hardware
   completely hides the private keys and must perform all private key
   operations.  To support such hardware, the "private-key" can be the
   special value "permanently-hidden" and the actions "generate-hidden-
   key" and "generate-certificate-signing-request" can be used to direct
   these operations to the hardware .

   This document in compliant with Network Management Datastore
   Architecture (NMDA) [RFC8342].  For instance, to support keys and
   associated certificates installed during manufacturing (e.g., for a
   IDevID [Std-802.1AR-2009] certificate), it is expected that such data
   may appear only in <operational>.

   While only asymmetric keys are currently supported, the module has
   been designed to enable other key types to be introduced in the
   future.

   The module does not support protecting the contents of the keystore
   (e.g., via encryption), though it could be extended to do so in the
   future.

   It is not required that a system has an operating system level
   keystore utility to implement this module.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP

3.2.  Example Usage

   The following example illustrates what a fully configured keystore
   might look like in <operational>, as described by Section 5.3 in
   [RFC8342].  This datastore view illustrates data set by the
   manufacturing process alongside conventional configuration.  This
   keystore instance has four keys, two having one associated
   certificate, one having two associated certificates, and one empty
   key.

4.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module defined in this document is designed to be accessed
   via YANG based management protocols, such as NETCONF [RFC6241] and
   RESTCONF [RFC8040].  Both of these protocols have mandatory-to-
   implement secure transport layers (e.g., SSH, TLS) with mutual
   authentication.

   The NETCONF access control model (NACM) [RFC8341] provides the means
   to restrict access for particular users to a pre-configured subset of
   all available protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

      /: The entire data tree defined by this module is sensitive to
         write operations.  For instance, the addition or removal of
         keys, certificates, etc., can dramatically alter the
         implemented security policy.  For this reason, the NACM
         extension "default-deny-write" has been set for the entire data
         tree.

      /keystore/asymmetric-keys/asymmetric-key/private-key:  When
         writing this node, implementations MUST ensure that the
         strength of the key being configured is not greater than the
         strength of the underlying secure transport connection over
         which it is communicated.  Implementations SHOULD fail the
         write-request if ever the strength of the private key is
         greater then the strength of the underlying transport, and
         alert the client that the strength of the key may have been
         compromised.  Additionally, when deleting this node,
         implementations SHOULD automatically (without explicit request)
         zeroize these keys in the most secure manner available, so as
         to prevent the remnants of their persisted storage locations
         from being analyzed in any meaningful way.

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and data
   nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

      /keystore/asymmetric-keys/asymmetric-key/private-key:  This node
         is additionally sensitive to read operations such that, in
         normal use cases, it should never be returned to a client.  The
         best reason for returning this node is to support backup/
         restore type workflows.  For this reason, the NACM extension
         "default-deny-all" has been set for this data node.  Note that
         this extension is inherited from the grouping in the
         [I-D.ietf-netconf-crypto-types] module.

Appendix A.  Change Log

A.1.  00 to 01

   o  Replaced the 'certificate-chain' structures with PKCS#7
      structures.  (Issue #1)

   o  Added 'private-key' as a configurable data node, and removed the
      'generate-private-key' and 'load-private-key' actions.  (Issue #2)

   o  Moved 'user-auth-credentials' to the ietf-ssh-client module.
      (Issues #4 and #5)

A.2.  01 to 02

   o  Added back 'generate-private-key' action.

   o  Removed 'RESTRICTED' enum from the 'private-key' leaf type.

   o  Fixed up a few description statements.

A.3.  02 to 03

   o  Changed draft's title.

   o  Added missing references.

   o  Collapsed sections and levels.

   o  Added RFC 8174 to Requirements Language Section.

   o  Renamed 'trusted-certificates' to 'pinned-certificates'.

   o  Changed 'public-key' from config false to config true.

   o  Switched 'host-key' from OneAsymmetricKey to definition from RFC
      4253.

A.4.  03 to 04

   o  Added typedefs around leafrefs to common keystore paths

   o  Now tree diagrams reference ietf-netmod-yang-tree-diagrams

   o  Removed Design Considerations section

   o  Moved key and certificate definitions from data tree to groupings

A.5.  04 to 05

   o  Removed trust anchors (now in their own draft)

   o  Added back global keystore structure

   o  Added groupings enabling keys to either be locally defined or a
      reference to the keystore.

A.6.  05 to 06

   o  Added feature "local-keys-supported"

   o  Added nacm:default-deny-all and nacm:default-deny-write

   o  Renamed generate-asymmetric-key to generate-hidden-key

   o  Added an install-hidden-key action

   o  Moved actions inside fo the "asymmetric-key" container

   o  Moved some groupings to draft-ietf-netconf-crypto-types

A.7.  06 to 07

   o  Removed a "require-instance false"

   o  Clarified some description statements

   o  Improved the keystore-usage examples

A.8.  07 to 08

   o  Added "local-definition" containers to avoid posibility of the
      action/notification statements being under a "case" statement.

   o  Updated copyright date, boilerplate template, affiliation, folding
      algorithm, and reformatted the YANG module.
