d=  The domain of the signing entity (plain-text; REQUIRED).  This is
       the domain that will be queried for the public key.  This domain
       MUST be the same as or a parent domain of the "i=" tag (the
       signing identity, as described below), or it MUST meet the
       requirements for parent domain signing described in Section 3.8.
       When presented with a signature that does not meet these
       requirement, verifiers MUST consider the signature invalid.

       Internationalized domain names MUST be encoded as described in
       [RFC3490].

       ABNF:

d=

         Specifies the SDID claiming responsibility for an introduction
         of a message into the mail stream (plain-text; REQUIRED).  This
         is the domain that will be queried for the public key.  The
         SDID MUST correspond to a valid DNS name under which the DKIM
         key record is published.  The conventions and semantics used by
         a signer to create and use a specific SDID are outside the
         scope of the DKIM Signing specification, as is any use of those
         conventions and semantics.  When presented with a signature
         that does not meet these requirements, verifiers MUST consider
         the signature invalid.

         Internationalized domain names MUST be encoded as described in

i=  Identity of the user or agent (e.g., a mailing list manager) on
       behalf of which this message is signed (dkim-quoted-printable;
       OPTIONAL, default is an empty Local-part followed by an "@"
       followed by the domain from the "d=" tag).  The syntax is a
       standard email address where the Local-part MAY be omitted.  The
       domain part of the address MUST be the same as or a subdomain of
       the value of the "d=" tag.

       Internationalized domain names MUST be converted using the steps
       listed in Section 4 of [RFC3490] using the "ToASCII" function.

         The Agent or User Identifier (AUID) on behalf of which the SDID
         is taking responsibility (dkim-quoted-printable; OPTIONAL,

         the domain from the "d=" tag).

         The syntax is a standard email address where the Local-part MAY
