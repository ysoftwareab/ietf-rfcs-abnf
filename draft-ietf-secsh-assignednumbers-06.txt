1.  Editor's Note

   The references in this document are statically defined.  However, the
   locations of the referenced materials are dynamic and are changing
   with the whims of the Working Group.  Please do not comment to the
   editor or the Working Group about inaccuracies along those lines in
   this document at this time.  (This paragraph will be removed before
   this document is submitted to the RFC Editor.)

2.  Introduction

   This document does not define any new protocols.  It is intended only
   to create the initial state of the IANA databases for the SSH
   protocol.  Except for one HISTORIC algorithm generally regarded as
   obsolete, this document does not define any new protocols or any
   number ranges not already defined in: [SSH-ARCH], [SSH-TRANS],
   [SSH-USERAUTH], [SSH-CONNECT]

3.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
   and "MAY" that appear in this document are to be interpreted as
   described in [RFC2119]

   The used data types and terminology are specified in the architecture
   document [SSH-ARCH]

   The architecture document also discusses the algorithm naming
   conventions that MUST be used with the SSH protocols.

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1  Message Numbers

   The Message Number is an 8-bit value, which describes the payload of
   a packet.

   Protocol packets have message numbers in the range 1 to 255.  These
   numbers have been allocated as follows in [SSH-ARCH]:

     Transport layer protocol:

       1 to 19    Transport layer generic (e.g. disconnect, ignore, debug, etc.)
       20 to 29   Algorithm negotiation
       30 to 49   Key exchange method specific (numbers can be reused for
                  different authentication methods)

     User authentication protocol:



Lehtinen & Lonvick      Expires December 1, 2004                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft       SSH Protocol Assigned Numbers             June 2004


       50 to 59   User authentication generic
       60 to 79   User authentication method specific (numbers can be
                  reused for different authentication methods)

     Connection protocol:

       80 to 89   Connection protocol generic
       90 to 127  Channel related messages

     Reserved for client protocols:

       128 to 191 Reserved

     Local extensions:

       192 to 255 Local extensions


   Requests for assignments of new message numbers must be accompanied
   by an RFC which describes the new packet type.  If the RFC is not on
   the standards-track (i.e.  it is an informational or experimental
   RFC), it must be explicitly reviewed and approved by the IESG before
   the RFC is published and the message number is assigned.
