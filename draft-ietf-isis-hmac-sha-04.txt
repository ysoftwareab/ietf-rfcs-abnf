Abstract 
    
   This document proposes an extension to IS-IS to allow the use of any 
   cryptographic authentication algorithm in addition to the already 
   documented authentication schemes, described in the base    
   specification and RFC 3567.   
        
   Although this document has been written specifically for using HMAC 
   construct along with the SHA family of cryptographic hash functions, 
   the method described in this document is generic and can be used to 
   extend IS-IS to support any cryptographic hash function in the 
   future.

1. Introduction 
    
   IS-IS [ISO] [RFC1195] specification allows for authentication of its 
   PDUs via the authentication TLV 10 that is carried as the part of the 
   PDU. The base spec has provision for only clear text passwords and 
   RFC 3567 [RFC3567] augments this to provide the capability to use 
   HMAC MD5 authentication for its PDUs. 
    
   The first octet of value field of TLV 10 specifies the type of 
   authentication to be carried out. Type 0 is reserved, Type 1 
   indicates a cleartext password, Type 54 indicates HMAC MD5 and Type 
   255 is used for routing domain private authentication methods. The 
   remainder of the value field contains the actual authentication data 
   determined by the value of the authentication type. 
    
   This document proposes a new authentication type to be carried in TLV 
   10, called the generic cryptographic authentication (CRYPTO_AUTH). 
   This can be used to specify any authentication algorithm for 
   authenticating and verifying IS-IS PDUs.  
        
   This document also explains how HMAC-SHA authentication can be used 
   in IS-IS.

   By definition, HMAC [RFC2104] requires a cryptographic hash function. 
   We propose to use any one of SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 and 
   SHA-512 [NIST] for this purpose to authenticate the IS-IS PDUs. 
    
   We propose to do away with the per interface keys and instead have 
   key IDs that map to unique IS-IS Security Associations.  
    
   While there are no openly published attacks on the HMAC-MD5 
   mechanism, some reports [Dobb96a, Dobb96b] create concern about the 
   ultimate strength of the MD5 cryptographic hash function. 
    
2. IS-IS Security Association 
 
   An IS-IS Security Association (SA) contains a set of shared 
   parameters between any two legitimate IS-IS speakers.  
    
   Parameters associated with an IS-IS SA: 
    
   O Key ID – This is a one octet unsigned integer used to uniquely 
   identify an IS-IS SA, as manually configured by the network operator. 
   The receiver determines the active SA by looking at this field in the 
   incoming PDU. The sender puts this Key ID based on the active 
   configuration.  
    
   Using key IDs makes changing keys while maintaining protocol 
   operation convenient. Each key ID specifies two independent parts, 
   the authentication protocol and the authentication key, as explained 
   below. Normally, an implementation would allow the network operator 
   to configure a set of keys in a key chain, with each key in the chain 
   having fixed lifetime. The actual operation of these mechanisms is 
   outside the scope of this document. 
    
   Note that each key ID can indicate a key with a different 
   authentication protocol. This allows multiple authentication 
   mechanisms to be used at various times without disrupting IS-IS 
   peering, including the introduction of new authentication mechanisms. 
    
   o Authentication Algorithm – This signifies the authentication 
   algorithm to be used with the IS-IS SA. Valid values are HMAC-SHA-1, 
   HMAC-SHA-224, HMAC-SHA-256, HMAC-SHA-384 and HMAC-SHA-512. 
    
   o Authentication Key – This value denotes the key associated with the 
   IS-IS SA. The length of this key is variable and depends upon the 
   authentication algorithm specified by the IS-IS SA.

3. Authentication Procedures 
 
3.1 Authentication TLV 
    
   A new authentication code, 0x3, indicates the CRYPTO_AUTH mechanism 
   described in this document is in use, is inserted in the first octet 
   of the existing IS-IS Authentication TLV (10).

3.2 Authentication Process 
    
   When calculating the CRYPTO_AUTH result for Sequence Number PDUs, 
   Level 1 Sequence Number PDUs SHALL use the Area Authentication string 
   as in Level 1 Link State PDUs. Level 2 Sequence Number PDUs shall use 
   the domain authentication string as in Level 2 Link State PDUs. 
    
   IS-IS HELLO PDUs SHALL use the Link Level Authentication String, 
   which MAY be different from that of Link State PDUs. The CRYPTO_AUTH   
   result for the IS-IS HELLO PDUs SHALL be calculated after the PDU is 
   padded to the MTU size, if padding is not disabled.  Implementations 
   that support the optional checksum for the Sequence Number PDUs and 
   IS-IS HELLO PDUs MUST NOT include the Checksum TLV. 
 
3.3 Cryptographic Aspects 
    
   In the algorithm description below, the following nomenclature, which 
   is consistent with [FIPS-198], is used: 
    
   H    is the specific hashing algorithm (e.g. SHA-256). 
   K    is the password for the PDU type as per ISO 10589. 
   Ko   is the cryptographic key used with the hash algorithm. 
    
   B    is the block size of H, measured in octets rather than bits. 
    
   Note that B is the internal block size, not the hash size.

Internet Draft IS-IS Generic Cryptographic Authentication  November 2007 
 
 
        For SHA-1 and SHA-256:   B == 64 
        For SHA-384 and SHA-512: B == 128 
   L    is the length of the hash, measured in octets rather than bits. 
    
   XOR  is the exclusive-or operation. 
   Opad is the hexadecimal value 0x5c repeated B times. 
   Ipad is the hexadecimal value 0x36 repeated B times. 
   Apad is the hexadecimal value 0x878FE1F3 repeated (L/4) times. 
    
   (1)Preparation of the Key 
 
      In this application, Ko is always L octets long. 
    
      If the Authentication Key (K) is L octets long, then Ko is equal 
      to K.  If the Authentication Key (K) is more than L octets long, 
      then Ko is set to H(K).  If the Authentication Key (K) is less 
      than L octets long, then Ko is set to the Authentication Key (K) 
      with zeros appended to the end of the Authentication Key (K) such 
      that Ko is L octets long. 
    
   (2)First Hash 
    
      First, the IS-IS packet's Authentication Data field is filled with  
      the value Apad and the Authentication Type field is set to 0x3. 
    
      Then, a first hash, also known as the inner hash, is computed 
      as follows: 
    
              First-Hash = H(Ko XOR Ipad || (IS-IS PDU)) 
    
   (3)Second Hash 
    
      Then a second hash, also known as the outer hash, is computed 
      as follows: 
    
              Second-Hash = H(Ko XOR Opad || First-Hash) 
    
   (4)Result 
    
      The result Second-Hash becomes the Authentication Data that is 
      sent in the Authentication Data field of the IS-IS PDU. The length  
      of the Authentication Data field is always identical to the  
      message digest size of the specific hash function H that is being  
      used. 
    
      This also means that the use of hash functions with larger output  
      sizes will also increase the size of the IS-IS PDU as transmitted  
      on the wire.

3.4 Procedures at the Sending Side 
    
   An appropriate IS-IS SA is selected for use with an outgoing IS-IS   
   PDU. This is done based on the active key at that instant. If IS-IS   
   is unable to find an active key, then the PDU is discarded.  
        
   If IS-IS is able to find the active key, then the key gives the 
   authentication algorithm (HMAC-SHA-1, HMAC-SHA-224, HMAC-SHA-256, 
   HMAC-SHA-384 or HMAC-SHA-512) that needs to be applied on the PDU. 
    
   An implementation MUST fill the authentication type and the length 
   before the authentication data is computed. The authentication data 
   is computed as explained in the previous section. The length of the 
   TLV is set as per the authentication algorithm that is being used.  
    
   It’s set to 22 for HMAC-SHA-1, 30 for HMAC-SHA-224, 34 for HMAC-SHA-
   256, 50 for HMAC-SHA-384 and 66 for HMAC-SHA-512. Note that one octet 
   has been added to account for the Key ID and one octet for the 
   authentication type.  
    
   The key ID is filled. 
    
   The Checksum and Remaining Life time fields are set to Zero for the 
   LSPs before authentication is calculated. 
    
   The result of the authentication algorithm is placed in the 
   Authentication data, following the key ID. 
    
   The authentication data for the IS-IS IIH PDUs MUST be computed after 
   the IIH has been padded to the MTU size, if padding is not explicitly 
   disabled.  
    
3.5 Procedure at the Receiving Side 
    
   The appropriate IS-IS SA is identified by looking at the Key ID from 
   the Authentication TLV 10 from the incoming IS-IS PDU. 
    
   Authentication algorithm dependent processing, needs to be performed, 
   using the algorithm specified by the appropriate IS-IS SA for the 
   received packet. 
    
   Before an implementation performs any processing it needs to save the 
   values of the Authentication Value field, the Checksum and the 
   Remaining Life time. 
    
   It should then set the Authentication Value field with Apad and zero 
   the Checksum and Remaining Life time fields before the authentication 
   data is computed. The calculated data is compared with the received

Internet Draft IS-IS Generic Cryptographic Authentication  November 2007 
 
 
   authentication data in the PDU and the PDU is discarded if the two do 
   not match. In such a case, an error event SHOULD be logged. 
    
   An implementation MAY have a transition mode where it includes 
   CRYPTO_AUTH information in the PDUs but does not verify this 
   information. This is provided as a transition aid for networks in the 
   process of migrating to the new CRYPTO_AUTH based authentication 
   schemes.  
        
   Similarly, implementations not supporting the CRYPTO_AUTH field MAY 
   accept PDUs that contain this particular field in TLV 10. 
    
4. Security Considerations  
    
   The document proposes extensions to IS-IS which would make it more 
   secure than what it is today. It does not provide confidentiality as 
   a routing protocol contains information that does not need to be kept 
   secret. It does however, provide means to authenticate the sender of 
   the PDUs which is of interest to us. 
    
   The technology in this document provides an authentication mechanism 
   for IS-IS.  The mechanism described here is not perfect and does not 
   need to be perfect. Instead, this mechanism represents a significant 
   increase in the work function of an adversary attacking the IS-IS 
   protocol, while not causing undue implementation, deployment, or 
   operational complexity. 
    
   The mechanism detailed in this document does not protect IS-IS 
   against replay attacks. An adversary could in theory replay old IIHs 
   and bring down the adjacency [CRYPTO] or replay old CSNPs and PSNPs 
   that would cause a flood of LSPs in the network. Using some sort of 
   crypto sequence numbers in IS-IS IIHs and CSNP/PSNPs is an option to 
   solve this problem. Discussing this is beyond the scope of this 
   document and it’s a matter which needs to be followed in the WG. 
    
   This document states that the remaining lifetime of the LSP MUST be 
   set to zero before computing the authentication, thus this field is 
   not authenticated. This field is excluded so that the LSPs may be 
   aged by the ISes in between without requiring to recompute the 
   authentication data. This can be exploited by an attacker. 
    
   To ensure greater security, the keys used must be changed 
   periodically and implementations MUST be able to store and use more 
   than one key at the same time.  
    
   It should be noted that the cryptographic strength of the HMAC 
   depends upon the cryptographic strength of the underlying hash 
   function and on the size and quality of the key.

   If a stronger authentication were believed to be required, then the 
   use of a full digital signature [RFC-2154] would be an approach that 
   should be seriously considered.  It was rejected for this purpose at 
   this time because the computational burden of full digital signatures 
   is believed to be much higher than is reasonable given the current 
   threat environment in operational commercial networks.

   Morris Dworkin of (US) NIST for review of portions of this document 
   that are directly derived from the closely related work on RIPv2 
   Cryptographic Authentication [RFC-4822]. 
    
6. IANA Considerations  
 
   This document requests that IANA create a new code point registry to  
   administer the Authentication Type code points for TLV 10. This  
   registry would be part of the existing IS-IS code points registry as   
   established by [RFC-3563] and [RFC-3359].  This registry should be 
   managed using the Designated Expert policy as described in 
   [RFC-2434bis] and will be called IS-IS Authentication Type Codes.  
        
   The values in the IS-IS Authentication Type Codes registry should be  
   recorded in decimal and should only be approved after a designated  
   expert, appointed by the IESG area director, has been consulted.  
   The intention is that any allocation will be accompanied by a 
   published RFC.  However, the Designated Expert can approve  
   allocations once it seems clear that an RFC will be published, 
   allowing for the allocation of values prior to the document being   
   approved for publication as an RFC. New items should be documented in  
   a publicly and freely available specification. We should also have 
   the provision of allowing external specifications to allocate and use  
   the IS-IS Authentication Type Codes maintained by this registry.  
        
   Initial values for the IS-IS Authentication Type Codes registry are  
   given below; future assignments are to be made through Expert Review. 
   Assignments consist of an authentication type name and its associated 
   value.
