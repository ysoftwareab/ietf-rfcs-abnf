   This document describes how EVPN can be used to support Virtual
   Private Wire Service (VPWS) in MPLS/IP networks. EVPN enables the
   following characteristics for VPWS: single-active as well as all-
   active multi-homing with flow-based load-balancing, eliminates the
   need for traditional way of PW signaling, and provides fast
   protection convergence upon node or link failure.

INTERNET DRAFT            VPWS support in EVPN              July 5, 2016


1  Introduction

   This document describes how EVPN can be used to support Virtual
   Private Wire Service (VPWS) in MPLS/IP networks. The use of EVPN
   mechanisms for VPWS brings the benefits of EVPN to p2p services.
   These benefits include single-active redundancy as well as all-active
   redundancy with flow-based load-balancing. Furthermore, the use of
   EVPN for VPWS eliminates the need for traditional way of PW signaling
   for p2p Ethernet services, as described in section 4.

   [RFC7432] has the ability to forward customer traffic to/from a given
   customer Attachment Circuit (AC), without any MAC lookup. This
   capability is ideal in providing p2p services (aka VPWS services).
   [MEF] defines Ethernet Virtual Private Line (EVPL) service as p2p
   service between a pair of ACs (designated by VLANs) and Ethernet
   Private Line (EPL) service, in which all traffic flows are between a
   single pair of ports, that in EVPN terminology would mean a single
   pair of ESes. EVPL can be considered as a VPWS with only two ACs. In
   delivering an EVPL service, the traffic forwarding capability of EVPN
   based on the exchange of a pair of Ethernet AD routes is used;
   whereas, for more general VPWS, traffic forwarding capability of EVPN
   based on the exchange of a group of Ethernet AD routes (one Ethernet
   AD route per AC/ES) is used. In a VPWS service,  the traffic from an
   originating Ethernet Segment can be forwarded only to a single
   destination Ethernet Segment; hence, no MAC lookup is needed and the
   MPLS label associated with the per-EVI Ethernet AD route can be used
   in forwarding user traffic to the destination AC.  

   Both services are supported by using the per EVI Ethernet A-D route
   which contains an Ethernet Segment Identifier, in which the customer
   ES is encoded, and an Ethernet Tag, in which the VPWS service
   instance identifier is encoded.  I.e., for both EPL and EVPL
   services, a specific VPWS service instance is identified by a pair of
   per EVI Ethernet A-D routes which together identify the VPWS service
   instance endpoints and the VPWS service instance.  In the control
   plane the VPWS service instance is identified using the VPWS service
   instance identifiers advertised by each PE and in the data plane the
   value of the MPLS label advertised by one PE is used by the other PE
   to send traffic for that VPWS service instance. As with the Ethernet
   Tag in standard EVPN, the VPWS service instance identifier has
   uniqueness within an EVPN instance. 

   Unlike EVPN where Ethernet Tag ID in EVPN routes are set to zero for
   Port-based, vlan-based, and vlan-bundle interface mode and it is set
   to non-zero Ethernet tag ID for vlan-aware bundle mode, in EVPN-VPWS,
   for all the four interface modes, Ethernet tag ID in the Ethernet A-D
   route MUST be set to a valid value in all the service interface
   types.

INTERNET DRAFT            VPWS support in EVPN              July 5, 2016


   In terms of route advertisement and MPLS label lookup behavior, EVPN-
   VPWS resembles the vlan-aware bundle mode of [RFC7432] such that when
   a PE advertises per EVI Ethernet A-D route, the VPWS service instance
   serves as a 24-bit normalized Ethernet tag ID. The value of the MPLS
   label in this route represents both the EVI and the VPWS service
   instance, so that upon receiving an MPLS encapsulated packet, the
   disposition PE can identify the egress AC from the lookup of the MPLS
   label alone and perform any required tag translation. For EVPL
   service, the Ethernet frames transported over an MPLS/IP network
   SHOULD remain tagged with the originating VID and any VID translation
   is performed at the disposition PE. For EPL service, the Ethernet
   frames are transported as is and the tags are not altered. 

   The MPLS label value in the Ethernet A-D route can be set to the VNI
   for VxLAN encap, and this VNI may have a global scope or local scope
   per PE and may also be made equal to the VPWS service instance
   identifier set in the Ethernet A-D route.

   The Ethernet Segment identifier encoded in the Ethernet A-D per EVI
   route is not used to identify the service, however it can be used for
   flow-based load-balancing and mass withdraw functions.

   As with standard EVPN, the Ethernet A-D per ES route is used for fast
   convergence upon link or node failure and the Ethernet Segment route
   is used for auto-discovery of the PEs attached to a given multi-homed
   CE and to synchronize state between them. 


1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   MAC: Media Access Control

   MPLS: Multi Protocol Label Switching.

   OAM: Operations, Administration and Maintenance.

   PE: Provide Edge Node.

   CE: Customer Edge device e.g., host or router or switch.

   EVPL: Ethernet Virtual Private Line.

   EPL: Ethernet Private Line.

   EP-LAN: Ethernet Private LAN.

   EVP-LAN: Ethernet Virtual Private LAN.

   VPWS: Virtual Private Wire Service.

   EVI: EVPN Instance.

   ES: Ethernet Segment on a PE refer to the link attached to it, this
   link can be part of a set of links attached to different PEs in multi
   home cases, or could be a single link in single home cases. 

   Single-Active Mode: When a device or a network is multi-homed to two
   or more PEs and when only a single PE in such redundancy group can
   forward traffic to/from the multi-homed device or network for a given
   VLAN, then such multi-homing or redundancy is referred to as "Single-
   Active".

   All-Active: When a device is multi-homed to two or more PEs and when
   all PEs in such redundancy group can forward traffic to/from the
   multi-homed device for a given VLAN, then such multi-homing or
   redundancy is referred to as "All-Active".

1.2 Requirements

   1. EPL service access circuit maps to the whole Ethernet port.

   2. EVPL service access circuits are VLANs on single or double tagged
   trunk ports. Each VLAN individually (or <S-VLAN,C-VLAN> combination)
   will be considered to be an endpoint for an EVPL service, without any
   direct dependency on any other VLANs on the trunk. Other VLANs on the
   same trunk could also be used for EVPL services, but could also be
   associated with other services.

   3. If multiple VLANs on the same trunk are associated with EVPL
   services, the respective remote endpoints of these EVPLs could be
   dispersed across any number of PEs, i.e. different VLANs may lead to
   different destinations.

   4. The VLAN tag on the access trunk only has PE-local significance.
   The VLAN tag on the remote end could be different, and could also be
   double tagged when the other side is single tagged.

   5. Also, multiple EVPL service VLANs on the same trunk could belong
   to the same EVPN instance (EVI), or they could belong to different
   EVIs. This should be purely an administrative choice of the network
   operator.

   6. A given PE could have thousands of EVPLs configured. It must be
   possible to configure multiple EVPL services within the same EVI.

   7. Local access circuits configured to belong to a given EVPN
   instance could also belong to different physical access trunks.

   8. EP-LAN and EVP-LAN are possible on the same system and also ESIs
   can be shared between EVPL and EVP-LANs.

2 Service interface

2.1 VLAN-Based Service Interface

   With this service interface, a VPWS instance identifier corresponds
   to only a single VLAN on a specific interface.  Therefore, there is a
   one-to-one mapping between a VID on this interface and the VPWS
   service instance identifier. The PE provides the cross-connect
   functionality between MPLS LSP identified by the VPWS service
   instance identifier and a specific <port,VLAN>. If the VLAN is
   represented by different VIDs on different PEs. (e.g., a different
   VID per Ethernet segment per PE), then each PE needs to perform VID
   translation for frames destined to its Ethernet segment.  In such
   scenarios, the Ethernet frames transported over an MPLS/IP network
   SHOULD remain tagged with the originating VID, and a VID translation
   MUST be supported in the data path and MUST be performed on the
   disposition PE. 

2.2 VLAN Bundle Service Interface

   With this service interface, a VPWS service instance identifier
   corresponds to multiple VLANs on a specific interface. The PE
   provides the cross-connect functionality between MPLS label
   identified by the VPWS service instance identifier and a group of
   VLANs on a specific interface. For this service interface, each VLAN
   is presented by a single VID which means no VLAN translation is
   allowed. The receiving PE, can direct the traffic based on EVPN label
   alone to a specific port. The transmitting PE can cross connect
   traffic from a group of VLANs on a specific port to the MPLS label.
   The MPLS-encapsulated frames MUST remain tagged with the originating
   VID.   

2.2.1 Port-Based Service Interface

   This service interface is a special case of the VLAN bundle service
   interface, where all of the VLANs on the port are mapped to the same
   VPWS service instance identifier.  The procedures are identical to
   those described in Section 2.2.

INTERNET DRAFT            VPWS support in EVPN              July 5, 2016


2.3 VLAN-Aware Bundle Service Interface

   Contrary to EVPN, in EVPN-VPWS this service interface maps to VLAN-
   based service interface (defined in section 2.1) and thus this
   service interface is not used in EVPN-VPWS.  In other words, if one
   tries to define data-plane and control plane behavior for this
   service interface, he would realize that it is the same as that of
   VLAN-based service.

3. BGP Extensions


   This document proposes the use of the per EVI Ethernet A-D route to
   signal VPWS services. The Ethernet Segment Identifier field is set to
   the customer ES and the Ethernet Tag ID 32-bit field is set to the
   24-bit VPWS service instance identifier.  For both EPL and EVPL
   services, for a given VPWS service instance the pair of PEs
   instantiating that VPWS service instance will each advertise a per
   EVI Ethernet A-D route with its VPWS service instance identifier and
   will each be configured with the other PE's VPWS service instance
   identifier. When each PE has received the other PE's per EVI Ethernet
   A-D route the VPWS service instance is instantiated. It should be
   noted that the same VPWS service instance identifier may be
   configured on both PEs.

   The Route-Target (RT) extended community with which the per EVI
   Ethernet A-D route is tagged identifies the EVPN instance in which
   the VPWS service instance is configured. It is the operator's choice
   as to how many and which VPWS service instances are configured in a
   given EVPN instance. However, a given EVPN instance MUST NOT be
   configured with both VPWS service instances and standard EVPN multi-
   point services.

3.1 EVPN Layer 2 attributes extended community

   This draft proposes a new extended community, defined below, to be
   included with the per EVI Ethernet A-D route. This attribute is
   mandatory if multihoming is enabled.

     The following bits in the Control Flags are defined; the remaining
     bits MUST be set to zero when sending and MUST be ignored when
     receiving this community.

     Name   Meaning

     P      If set to 1 in multihoming single-active scenarios, it 
            indicates that the advertising PE is the Primary PE.
            SHOULD be set to 1 for multihoming all-active scenarios.

     B      If set to 1 in multihoming single-active scenarios, it   
            indicates that the advertising PE is the Backup PE.

     C      If set to 1, a Control word [RFC4448] MUST be present 
            when sending EVPN packets to this PE.


   A received L2 MTU=0 means no MTU checking against local MTU is
   needed. A received non-zero MTU SHOULD be checked against local MTU
   and if there is a mismatch, the local PE MUST NOT add the remote PE
   as the EVPN destination for the corresponding VPWS service instance.

   The usage of the Per ES Ethernet AD route is unchanged from its usage
   in [RFC7432], i.e. the "Single-Active" bit in the flags of the ESI
   Label extended community will indicate if single-active or all-active
   redundancy is used for this ES. 

   In a multihoming all-active scenario, there is no DF election, and
   all the PEs in the ES that are active and ready to forward traffic
   to/from the CE will set the P bit to 1. A remote PE will do per-flow
   load balancing to the PEs that send P=1 for the same Ethernet Tag and
   ESI.

   In multihoming single-active scenario, the DF election will determine
   who the primary and the backup PEs are, and only those PEs will set
   the P bit and B bit respectively. A remote PE will forward the
   traffic to the primary PE and switch over to the backup PE as soon as
   it receives an Ethernet A-D route withdrawal from the primary PE in
   the Ethernet Segment.    

   In multihoming single-active scenario, during transient situations, a
   remote PE receiving P=1 from more than one PE will select the last
   advertising PE as the primary PE when forwarding traffic. A remote PE

   receiving B=1 from more than one PE will select only one backup PE. A
   remote PE MUST receive P=1 from at least one PE before forwarding
   traffic.

   As per [RFC6790], if a network uses entropy labels then the control
   word (C bit set) SHOULD NOT be used when sending EVPN-encapsulated
   packets over a P2P LSP.

   iBGP sessions are established between PE1, PE2, ASBR1 and ASBR3,
   possibly via a BGP route-reflector. Similarly, iBGP sessions are
   established between PE3, PE4, ASBR2 and ASBR4. eBGP sessions are
   established among ASBR1, ASBR2, ASBR3, and ASBR4.

   All PEs and ASBRs are enabled for the EVPN SAFI and exchange per EVI
   Ethernet A-D routes, one route per VPWS service instance.  For inter-
   AS option B, the ASBRs re-advertise these routes with Next Hop
   attribute set to their IP addresses. The link between the CE and the
   PE is either a C-tagged or S-tagged interface, as described in
   [802.1Q], that can carry a single VLAN tag or two nested VLAN tags
   and it is configured as a trunk with multiple VLANs, one per VPWS
   service instance. It should be noted that the VLAN ID used by the
   customer at either end of a VPWS service instance to identify that
   service instance may be different and EVPN doesn't perform that
   translation between the two values. Rather, the MPLS label will

   identify the VPWS service instance and if translation is needed, it
   should be done by the Ethernet interface for each service.

   For single-homed CE, in an advertised per EVI Ethernet A-D route the
   ESI field is set to 0 and the Ethernet Tag field is set to the VPWS
   service instance identifier that identifies the EVPL or EPL service.

   For a multi-homed CE, in an advertised per EVI Ethernet A-D route the
   ESI field is set to the CE's ESI and the Ethernet Tag field is set to
   the VPWS service instance identifier, which MUST have the same value
   on all PEs attached to that ES. This allows an ingress PE to perform
   flow-based load-balancing of traffic flows to all of the PEs attached
   to that ES. In all cases traffic follows the transport paths, which
   may be asymmetric.

   The VPWS service instance identifier encoded in the Ethernet Tag
   field in an advertised per EVI Ethernet A-D route MUST either be
   unique across all ASs, or an ASBR needs to perform a translation when
   the per EVI Ethernet A-D route is re-advertised by the ASBR from one
   AS to the other AS.

   Per ES Ethernet A-D route can be used for mass withdraw to withdraw
   all per EVI Ethernet A-D routes associated with the multi-home site
   on a given PE.


5 EVPN Comparison to PW Signaling

   In EVPN, service endpoint discovery and label signaling are done
   concurrently using BGP. Whereas, with VPWS based on [RFC4448], label
   signaling is done via LDP and service endpoint discovery is either
   through manual provisioning or through BGP. 

   In existing implementation of VPWS using pseudowires(PWs), redundancy
   is limited to single-active mode, while with EVPN implementation of
   VPWS both single-active and all-active redundancy modes can be
   supported.

   In existing implementation with PWs, backup PWs are not used to carry
   traffic, while with EVPN, traffic can be load-balanced among
   different PEs multi-homed to a single CE.

   Upon link or node failure, EVPN can trigger failover with the
   withdrawal of a single BGP route per EVPL service or multiple EVPL
   services, whereas with VPWS PW redundancy, the failover sequence
   requires exchange of two control plane messages: one message to
   deactivate the group of primary PWs and a second message to activate
   the group of backup PWs associated with the access link.

   Finally, EVPN may employ data plane egress link protection mechanisms
   not available in VPWS. This can be done by the primary PE (on local
   AC down) using the label advertised in the per EVI Ethernet A-D route
   by the backup PE to encapsulate the traffic and direct it to backup
   PE.

6 Failure Scenarios

   On a link or port failure between the CE and the PE for both single
   and multi-homed CEs, unlike [RFC7432] the PE must withdraw all the
   associated Ethernet AD routes for the VPWS service instances on the
   failed port or link.

6.1 Single-Homed CEs

   Unlike [RFC7432],  EVPN-VPWS uses Ethernet AD route advertisements
   for single-homed Ethernet Segments. Therefore, upon a link/port
   failure of this single-homed Ethernet Segment, the PE MUST withdraw
   the associated per EVI Ethernet A-D routes.

6.2 Multi-Homed CEs 

   For a faster convergence in multi-homed scenarios with either Single-
   Active Redundancy or All-active redundancy, mass withdraw technique
   as per [RFC7432] baseline is used. A PE previously advertising a per
   ES Ethernet A-D route, can withdraw this route signaling to the
   remote PEs to switch all the VPWS service instances associated with
   this multi-homed ES to the backup PE

8 Security Considerations

   The mechanisms in this document use EVPN control plane as defined in
   [RFC7432]. Security considerations described in [RFC7432] are equally
   applicable.

   This document uses MPLS and IP-based tunnel technologies to support
   data plane transport. Security considerations described in [RFC7432]
   and in [ietf-evpn-overlay] are equally applicable.
