                Special Use Domain Name 'ipv4only.arpa'
                draft-cheshire-sudn-ipv4only-dot-arpa-08

Abstract

   The specification for how a client discovers its network's NAT64
   prefix [RFC7050] defines the special name 'ipv4only.arpa' for this
   purpose, but declares it to be a non-special name in that
   specification's Domain Name Reservation Considerations section.

   Consequently, despite the well articulated special purpose of the
   name, (at the time of writing) 'ipv4only.arpa' still does not appear
   as one of the names with special properties recorded in the Special-
   Use Domain Names registry.

   As a result of this omission, in cases where software needs to give
   this name special treatment in order for it to work correctly, there
   is no clear mandate authorizing software authors to implement that
   special treatment.  Software implementers are left with the choice
   between not implementing the special behavior necessary for the name
   queries to work correctly, or implementing the special behavior and
   being accused of being noncompliant with some RFC.

   This document formally declares the actual special properties of the
   name, and adds similar declarations for the corresponding reverse
   mapping names.

1.  Introduction

   The specification for how a client discovers its network's NAT64
   prefix [RFC7050] defines the special name 'ipv4only.arpa' for this
   purpose, but declares it to be a non-special name in that
   specification's Domain Name Reservation Considerations section.

   Consequently, despite the well articulated special purpose of the
   name, (at the time of writing) 'ipv4only.arpa' still does not appear
   as one of the names with special properties recorded in the Special-
   Use Domain Names registry [SUDN].

   As a result of this omission, in cases where software needs to give
   this name special treatment in order for it to work correctly, there
   is no clear mandate authorizing software authors to implement that
   special treatment.  Software implementers are left with the choice
   between not implementing the special behavior necessary for the name
   queries to work correctly, or implementing the special behavior and
   being accused of being noncompliant with some RFC.

   This document formally declares the actual special properties of the
   name, and adds similar declarations for the corresponding reverse
   mapping names.

2.  Specialness of 'ipv4only.arpa'

   The hostname 'ipv4only.arpa' is peculiar in that it was never
   intended to be treated like a normal hostname.

   A typical client never looks up the IPv4 address records for
   'ipv4only.arpa', because it is already known, by specification
   [RFC7050], to have exactly two IPv4 address records, 192.0.0.170 and
   192.0.0.171.  No client ever has to look the name in order to learn
   those two addresses.

   In contrast, clients often look up the IPv6 AAAA address records for
   'ipv4only.arpa', which is contrary to general DNS expectations, given
   that it is already known, by specification [RFC7050], that no such
   IPv6 AAAA address records exist.  And yet, clients expect to receive,
   and do in fact receive, positive answers for these IPv6 AAAA address
   records that are known to not exist.

   This is clearly not a typical DNS name.  In normal operation, clients
   never query for the two records that do in fact exist; instead they
   query for records that are known to not exist, and then get positive
   answers to those abnormal queries.  Clients are using DNS to perform
   queries for this name, but they are certainly not using DNS to learn
   legitimate answers from the name's legitimate authoritative server.
   Instead, these clients have, in effect, co-opted the DNS protocol as
   an impromptu client-to-middlebox communication protocol, to
   communicate with the NAT64/DNS64 [RFC6146][RFC6147] gateway, if
   present, and request that it disclose the prefix it is using for IPv6
   address synthesis.

   It is this use of specially-crafted DNS queries as an impromptu
   client-to-middlebox communication protocol that makes the name
   'ipv4only.arpa' most definitely a special name, and one that should
   be listed in IANA's registry along with other DNS names that have
   special uses [SUDN].

3.  Consequences of 'ipv4only.arpa' previously being declared unspecial

   As a result of the original specification [RFC7050] not formally
   declaring 'ipv4only.arpa' to have special properties, there was no
   mandate for any DNS software to treat this name specially.
   Consequently, queries for this name had to be handled normally,
   resulting in unnecessary queries to the authoritative 'arpa' name
   servers.

   Having millions of devices around the world issue these queries
   generated pointless additional load on the authoritative 'arpa' name
   servers, which was completely unnecessary when the name
   'ipv4only.arpa' is defined, by Internet Standard, to have exactly two
   IPv4 address records, 192.0.0.170 and 192.0.0.171, and no other
   records of any type.

   Also, at times, for reasons that are as yet unclear, the
   authoritative 'arpa' name servers have been observed to be slow or
   unresponsive.  The failures of these 'ipv4only.arpa' queries result
   in unnecessary failures of software that depends on them for DNS64
   [RFC6147] address synthesis.

   Even when the authoritative 'arpa' name servers are operating
   correctly, having to perform an unnecessary query to obtain an answer
   that is already known in advance can add precious milliseconds of
   delay for no reason.

   A more serious problem occurs when a device is configured to use a
   recursive/caching DNS server other than the one it learned from the
   network.  Typically a device joining a NAT64 network will learn the
   recursive/caching DNS server recommended for that network either via
   IPv6 Router Advertisement Options for DNS Configuration [RFC6106] or
   via DNS Configuration options for DHCPv6 [RFC3646].  On a NAT64
   network it is essential that the client use the recursive/caching
   DNS64 server recommended for that network, since only that DNS64
   server can be relied upon to know the appropriate prefix(es) to use
   for synthesizing IPv6 addresses that will be acceptable to the NAT64
   server.

   However, it is not uncommon for users to manually override their
   default DNS configuration because they wish to use some other public
   recursive resolver on the Internet, perhaps because they perceive
   their preferred recursive resolver to be faster, more reliable, or
   more trustworthy.

   Another common scenario is the use of corporate VPN client software,
   which overrides the default configuration to divert DNS requests to
   the company's own private internal recursive resolver, because the

Internet-Draft         Special Name ipv4only.arpa           October 2017


   local network's recursive resolver will typically be unable to
   provide answers for the company's private internal host names.
   Similarly, the company's private internal recursive resolver may not
   be able to synthesize IPv6 addresses correctly for use with the local
   network's NAT64 server, because it is unlikely to be aware of the
   NAT64 prefix in use on the local network.  It is clear that a single
   recursive resolver cannot meet both needs.  The local network's
   recursive resolver cannot give answers for some company's private
   internal host names, and some company's private internal recursive
   resolver cannot give correctly synthesized IPv6 addresses suitable
   for the local network's NAT64 gateway.

   The conflict here arises because DNS is being used for two unrelated
   purposes.  The first purpose is retrieving data from a (nominally)
   global database -- generally retrieving the IP address(es) associated
   with a hostname.  The second purpose is using the DNS protocol as a
   middlebox communication protocol, to interrogate the local network
   infrastructure to discover the IPv6 prefix(es) in use by the local
   NAT64 gateway for address synthesis.

   (Possibly this problem could be solved if we could force all NAT64
   gateways to use the same Well-Known Prefix for IPv6 address synthesis
   [RFC6052], but that would alleviate the need for 'ipv4only.arpa'
   altogether.)

   This document leverages this operational experience to update the
   Domain Name Reservation Considerations section [RFC6761] of the
   earlier specification [RFC7050] with one that accurately lists the
   actual special properties of the name 'ipv4only.arpa' so that
   software can legitimately make appropriate performance and
   reliability optimizations.

4.  Security Considerations

   Hard-coding the known answers for 'ipv4only.arpa' queries in
   recursive/caching DNS servers reduces the risk of malicious devices
   intercepting those queries and returning incorrect answers,
   particularly in the case of recursive/caching DNS servers that do not
   perform DNSSEC validation.

   One of the known concerns with DNS64 [RFC6147] is that it interferes
   with DNSSEC.  DNSSEC may cryptographically assert that a name has no
   IPv6 AAAA records, while at the same time DNS64 address synthesis is
   contradicting this and claiming that IPv6 AAAA records do exist.

   Section 3 of the DNS64 specification [RFC6147] discusses this:

      ... DNS64 receives a query with the DO bit set and
      the CD bit set. In this case, the DNS64 is supposed
      to pass on all the data it gets to the query initiator.
      This case will not work with DNS64, unless the
      validating resolver is prepared to do DNS64 itself.

   The NAT64 Prefix Discovery specification [RFC7050] provides the
   mechanism for the query initiator to learn the NAT64 prefix so that
   it can do its own validation and DNS64 synthesis as described above.
   With this mechanism the client can (i) interrogate the local NAT64/
   DNS64 gateway with an 'ipv4only.arpa' query to learn the IPv6 address
   synthesis prefix, (ii) query for the (signed) IPv4 address records
   itself, and then (iii) perform its own IPv6 address synthesis
   locally, combining the IPv6 address synthesis prefix learned from the
   local NAT64/DNS64 gateway with the secure DNSSEC-signed data learned
   from the global Domain Name System.

   It is conceivable that over time, if DNSSEC is successful, the
   majority of clients could move to this validate-and-synthesize-
   locally model, which reduces the DNS64 machinery to the vestigial
   role of simply responding to the 'ipv4only.arpa' query to report the
   local IPv6 address synthesis prefix.  In no case does the client care
   what answer(s) the authoritative 'arpa' name servers might give for
   that query.  The 'ipv4only.arpa' query is being used purely as a
   local client-to-middlebox communication message.

   This approach is even more attractive if it does not create an
   additional dependency on the authoritative 'arpa' name servers to
   answer a query that is unnecessary because the NAT64/DNS64 gateway
   already knows the answer before it even issues the query.  Avoiding
   this unnecessary query improves performance and reliability for the
   client, and reduces unnecessary load for the authoritative 'arpa'
   name servers.

5.  IANA Considerations

   [Once published, this should say]

   IANA has recorded the following names in the
   Special-Use Domain Names registry [SUDN]:

      ipv4only.arpa.
      170.0.0.192.in-addr.arpa.
      171.0.0.192.in-addr.arpa.

   IANA has recorded the following IPv4 addresses in the
   IPv4 Special-Purpose Address Registry [SUv4]:

      192.0.0.170
      192.0.0.171

6.  Domain Name Reservation Considerations

6.1.  Conventions and Terminology Used in this Section

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this section are to be interpreted as described in "Key
   words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels" [RFC2119].

6.2.  Special Use Domain Name 'ipv4only.arpa'

   The name 'ipv4only.arpa' is defined, by Internet Standard, to have
   two IPv4 address records with rdata 192.0.0.170 and 192.0.0.171.

   When queried via a DNS64 [RFC6147] recursive/caching server, the name
   'ipv4only.arpa' is also defined to have IPv6 AAAA records, with rdata
   synthesized from a combination of the NAT64 IPv6 prefix(es), and the
   IPv4 addresses 192.0.0.170 and 192.0.0.171.  This can return more
   than one pair of IPv6 addresses if there are multiple NAT64 prefixes.

   The name 'ipv4only.arpa' has no other DNS records of any type.
   There are no subdomains of ipv4only.arpa.  All names falling below
   'ipv4only.arpa' are defined to be nonexistent (NXDOMAIN).

Internet-Draft         Special Name ipv4only.arpa           October 2017


   The name 'ipv4only.arpa' is special to
   (a) client software wishing to perform DNS64 address synthesis,
   (b) APIs responsible for retrieving the correct information, and
   (c) the DNS64 recursive/caching server responding to such requests.
   These three considerations are listed in items 2, 3 and 4 below:

   1.  Normal users should never have reason to encounter the
       'ipv4only.arpa' domain name.  If they do, they should expect
       queries for 'ipv4only.arpa' to result in the answers required by
       the specification [RFC7050].  Normal users have no need to know
       that 'ipv4only.arpa' is special.

   2.  Application software may explicitly use the name 'ipv4only.arpa'
       for NAT64/DNS64 address synthesis, and expect to get the answers
       required by the specification [RFC7050].  If application software
       encounters the name 'ipv4only.arpa' in the normal course of
       handling user input, the application software should resolve that
       name as usual and need not treat it in any special way.

   3.  Name resolution APIs and libraries MUST recognize 'ipv4only.arpa'
       as special and MUST give it special treatment.  Regardless of any
       manual client DNS configuration, DNS overrides configured by VPN
       client software, or any other mechanisms that influence the
       choice of the client's recursive/caching DNS server address(es)
       (including client devices that run their own local recursive
       resolver and use the loopback address as their configured
       recursive/caching DNS server address) all queries for
       'ipv4only.arpa' and any subdomains of that name MUST be sent to
       the recursive/caching DNS server learned from the network via
       IPv6 Router Advertisement Options for DNS Configuration [RFC6106]
       or via DNS Configuration options for DHCPv6 [RFC3646].  Because
       DNS queries for 'ipv4only.arpa' are actually a special middlebox
       communication protocol, it is essential that they go to the
       middlebox in question, and failure to honor this requirement
       would cause failure of the NAT64 Prefix Discovery mechanism
       [RFC7050].

   4.  For the purposes of this section, recursive/caching DNS servers
       fall into two categories.  The first category is the traditional
       recursive/caching DNS servers that are in widespread use today.
       The second category is DNS64 servers, whose purpose is to
       synthesize IPv6 address records.

       Traditional recursive/caching DNS servers SHOULD NOT recognize
       'ipv4only.arpa' as special or give that name, or subdomains of
       that name, any special treatment.  The rationale for this is that
       a traditional recursive/caching DNS server, such as built in to a
       home gateway, may itself be downstream of a DNS64 server.

       Passing though the 'ipv4only.arpa' queries to the upstream DNS64
       server will allow the correct NAT64 prefix to be discovered.

       All DNS64 servers MUST recognize 'ipv4only.arpa' as special and
       MUST NOT attempt to look up NS records for it, or otherwise query
       authoritative DNS servers in an attempt to resolve this name.
       Instead, DNS64 servers MUST act as authoritative for this domain
       and generate immediate responses for all such queries.

       DNS64 servers MUST generate the 192.0.0.170 and 192.0.0.171
       responses for IPv4 address queries (DNS qtype "A"), the
       appropriate synthesized IPv6 address record responses for IPv6
       address queries (DNS qtype "AAAA"), and a negative
       ("no error no answer") response for all other query types.

       For all subdomains of 'ipv4only.arpa', DNS64 servers MUST
       generate immediate NXDOMAIN responses.  All names falling below
       'ipv4only.arpa' are defined to be nonexistent.

       An example configuration for BIND 9 showing how to achieve the
       desired result is given in Appendix A.

   5.  Traditional authoritative DNS server software need not recognize
       'ipv4only.arpa' as special or handle it in any special way.
       Recursive/caching DNS servers SHOULD routinely act as
       authoritative for this name and return the results described
       above.  Only the administrators of the 'arpa' namespace need to
       explicitly configure their actual authoritative name servers to
       be authoritative for this name and to generate the appropriate
       answers; all other authoritative name servers will not be
       configured to know anything about this name and will reject
       queries for it, as they would reject queries for any other name
       about which they have no information.

   6.  Generally speaking, operators of authoritative DNS servers need
       not know anything about the name 'ipv4only.arpa', just as they do
       not need to know anything about any other names they are not
       responsible for.  Operators of authoritative DNS servers who are
       configuring their name servers to be authoritative for this name
       MUST understand that 'ipv4only.arpa' is a special name, with
       records rigidly specified by Internet Standard (generally this
       applies only to the administrators of the 'arpa' namespace).

   7.  DNS Registries/Registrars need not know anything about the name
       'ipv4only.arpa', just as they do not need to know anything about
       any other name they are not responsible for.  Only the
       administrators of the 'arpa' namespace need to be aware of this
       name's purpose and how it should be configured.

6.3.  Names '170.0.0.192.in-addr.arpa' and '171.0.0.192.in-addr.arpa'

   Since the IPv4 addresses 192.0.0.170 and 192.0.0.171 are defined to
   be special, and are listed in the IPv4 Special-Purpose Address
   Registry [SUv4], the corresponding reverse mapping names in the
   in-addr.arpa domain are similarly special.

   The name '170.0.0.192.in-addr.arpa' is defined, by Internet Standard,
   to have only a single DNS record,
   type PTR, with rdata 'ipv4only.arpa'.

   The name '171.0.0.192.in-addr.arpa' is defined, by Internet Standard,
   to have only a single DNS record,
   type PTR, with rdata 'ipv4only.arpa'.

   There are no subdomains of '170.0.0.192.in-addr.arpa' or
   '171.0.0.192.in-addr.arpa'.  All names falling below these names are
   defined to be nonexistent (NXDOMAIN).

   Practically speaking these two names are rarely used, but to the
   extent that they may be, they are special only to recursive/caching
   DNS servers as described in item 4 below:

   1.  Normal users should never have reason to encounter these two
       reverse mapping names.  However, if they do, queries for these
       reverse mapping names should return the expected answer
       'ipv4only.arpa'.  Normal users have no need to know that these
       reverse mapping names are special.

   2.  Application software SHOULD NOT recognize these two reverse
       mapping names as special, and SHOULD NOT treat them differently.
       For example, if the user were to issue the Unix command
       "host 192.0.0.170" then the "host" command should issue the query
       as usual and display the result that is returned.

   3.  Name resolution APIs and libraries SHOULD recognize these two
       reverse mapping names as special and generate the required
       responses locally.  For the names '170.0.0.192.in-addr.arpa' and
       '171.0.0.192.in-addr.arpa' PTR queries yield the result
       'ipv4only.arpa'; all other query types yield a negative
       ("no error no answer") response.  For all subdomains of these two
       reverse mapping domains, all queries yield an NXDOMAIN response.
       All names falling below these two reverse mapping domains are
       defined to be nonexistent.

       This local self-contained generation of these responses is to
       avoid placing unnecessary load on the authoritative
       'in-addr.arpa' name servers.

   4.  Recursive/caching DNS servers SHOULD NOT recognize these two
       reverse mapping names as special and SHOULD NOT, by default, give
       them any special treatment.

   5.  Traditional authoritative DNS server software need not recognize
       these two reverse mapping names as special or handle them in any
       special way.
       As a practical matter, only the administrators of the
       '192.in-addr.arpa' namespace will configure their name servers to
       be authoritative for these names and to generate the appropriate
       answers; all other authoritative name servers will not be
       configured to know anything about these names and will reject
       queries for them as they would reject queries for any other name
       about which they have no information.

   6.  Generally speaking, operators of authoritative DNS servers need
       not know anything about these two reverse mapping names, just as
       they do not need to know anything about any other names they are
       not responsible for.  Operators of authoritative DNS servers who
       are configuring their name servers to be authoritative for this
       name MUST understand that these two reverse mapping names are
       special, with answers specified by Internet Standard (generally
       this applies only to the administrators of the '192.in-addr.arpa'
       namespace).

   7.  DNS Registries/Registrars need not know anything about these two
       reverse mapping names, just as they do not need to know anything
       about any other name they are not responsible for.  Only the
       administrators of the '192.in-addr.arpa' namespace need to be

Internet-Draft         Special Name ipv4only.arpa           October 2017


6.3.1.  ip6.arpa Reverse Mapping PTR Records

   For all IPv6 addresses synthesized by a DNS64 recursive resolver, the
   DNS64 recursive resolver server is responsible for synthesizing the
   appropriate 'ip6.arpa' reverse mapping PTR records too, if it chooses
   to provide reverse mapping PTR records.  The same applies to the
   synthesized IPv6 addresses corresponding to the IPv4 addresses
   192.0.0.170 and 192.0.0.171.

   Generally a DNS64 recursive/caching server synthesizes appropriate
   'ip6.arpa' reverse mapping PTR records by extracting the embedded
   IPv4 address from the encoded IPv6 address, performing a reverse
   mapping PTR query for that IPv4 address, and then synthesizing a
   corresponding 'ip6.arpa' reverse mapping PTR record containing the
   same rdata.

   In the case of synthesized IPv6 addresses corresponding to the IPv4
   addresses 192.0.0.170 and 192.0.0.171, the DNS64 recursive/caching
   server does not issue reverse mapping queries for those IPv4
   addresses, but instead, according to rule 3 above, immediately
   returns the answer 'ipv4only.arpa'.

   In the case of a client that uses the 'ipv4only.arpa' query to
   discover the IPv6 prefixes in use by the local NAT64 gateway, and
   then proceeds to perform its own address synthesis locally (which has
   benefits such as allowing DNSSEC validation), that client MUST also
   synthesize 'ip6.arpa' reverse mapping PTR records for those
   discovered prefix(es), according to the rules above: When a client's
   name resolution APIs and libraries receive a request to look up an
   'ip6.arpa' reverse mapping PTR record for an address that falls
   within one of the discovered NAT64 address synthesis prefixes, the
   software extracts the embedded IPv4 address and then, for IPv4
   addresses 192.0.0.170 and 192.0.0.171, returns the fixed answer
   'ipv4only.arpa', and for all other IPv4 addresses performs a reverse
   mapping PTR query for the IPv4 address, and then synthesizes a
   corresponding 'ip6.arpa' reverse mapping PTR record containing the
   same rdata.

7.  Acknowledgements

   Thanks to Jouni Korhonen, Teemu Savolainen, and Dan Wing, for
   devising the NAT64 Prefix Discovery mechanism [RFC7050], and for
   their feedback on this document.  Thanks to Geoff Huston for his
   feedback on the draft, and to Erik Kline for pointing out that the
   in-addr.arpa names are special too.  Thanks particularly to Lorenzo
   Colitti for an especially spirited hallway discussion at IETF 96 in
   Berlin, which lead directly to significant improvements in how this
   document presents the issues.

Appendix A.  Example BIND 9 Configuration

   A BIND 9 recursive/caching DNS server can be configured to act as
   authoritative for the necessary DNS64 names as described below.

   In /etc/named.conf the following line is added:

      zone "ipv4only.arpa"            { type master; file "ipv4only"; };

   The file /var/named/ipv4only is created with the following content:

      $TTL 86400               ; Default TTL 24 hours
      @ IN SOA nameserver.example. admin.nameserver.example. (
               2016052400      ; Serial
               7200            ; Refresh ( 7200 = 2 hours)
               3600            ; Retry   ( 3600 = 1 hour)
               15724800        ; Expire  (15724800 = 6 months)
               60              ; Minimum
               )
      @ IN NS  nameserver.example.

      @ IN A    192.0.0.170
