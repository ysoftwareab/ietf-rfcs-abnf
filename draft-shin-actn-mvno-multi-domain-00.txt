Abstract

   This document provides a use-case that addresses the need for
   virtual network operation for mobile operators, which is facilitated
   by the application of network abstraction. These abstractions shall
   create a virtual network operation environment supporting mobile
   operators in viewing, managing and operating multi-domains of many
   dimensions (e.g., radio access, backhaul transport, mobile DC edge,
   mobile DC core, packet/optical transport for DC interconnect, etc.)
   as a single virtualized network.

   This use-case considers the application of these abstractions and
   the need for the associated operational mechanisms within the
   network of a single operator.

1. Introduction

   Mobile network operators build and operate their network using
   multiple domains in different dimensions. From a network
   domain/technology point of view, mobile services/applications
   traverse many different domains such as radio access, backhaul
   transport, mobile DC edge, packet/optical backbone transport for DC
   interconnect, mobile DC core, etc. Due to this diversity of
   technology domains (e.g., radio, packet, optical, etc.) and the
   complex organizational boundaries for operations (e.g., access,
   backhaul, core transport, data center, etc.), the efficient
   operation of the services/applications spanning several of these
   domains has been a challenge for mobile operators.

Internet-Draft Multi-domain Mobile Virtual Network Operation March 2014


   In addition, multi-vendor issue adds another dimension of
   complexity. Both interoperability and operational concerns at the
   control and data planes have increased operational complexity and
   the OpEx.

   Moreover, the widespread deployment of middle boxes (e.g. edge cache,
   firewall etc.) inside the DC edge and core edge will be achieved due
   to tightly-coupled interaction with higher layer protocols and
   transport control protocols (i.e. GMPLS, RSVP, etc.)

   With the aforementioned situations, the introduction of new services
   and applications, often requiring connections that traverse multiple
   domains, necessitates significant planning, and several manual
   operations to interface different administrative zones, vendor
   equipment and transport technology.

   This document provides a use-case that addresses the need for
   facilitating the application of virtual network abstractions to
   mobile network operators. These abstractions shall create a
   virtualized network operation environment supporting mobile
   operators in viewing and controlling multi-domains of many
   dimensions (e.g., radio access, backhaul transport, mobile DC edge,
   mobile DC core, packet/optical transport for DC interconnect, etc.)
   as a single virtualized network. This use-case considers the
   application of these abstractions within the network of a single
   operator.

   This use-case is a part of the overarching work, called Abstraction
   and Control of Transport Networks (ACTN). The goal of ACTN is to
   facilitate virtual network operation by:

     . The creation of a virtualized environment allowing operators to
        view the abstraction of the underlying multi-admin, multi-
        vendor, multi-technology networks and

     . The operation and control/management of these multiple networks
        as a single virtualized network.

   This will accelerate rapid service deployment of new services,
   including more dynamic and elastic services, and improve overall
   network operations and scaling of existing services.

   problem statement [ACTN-PS].

      6. Internet Core Network Domain

   Mobile data application may find its servers hosted by the Mobile
   Edge DC (Domain 3) while some other applications hosted by servers
   in the Mobile Core DC (Domain 5). For the former case, the
   connectivity starts from a RAN edge and terminates at a Mobile Edge
   Data Center. For the latter case, the connectivity is extended
   beyond the Mobile Edge Data Center and traverses the Mobile Backhaul
   Transport Network domain and the Core Transport Network domain.

   There are several issues that are relevant in the ACTN context:

   1. Transport from RAN to Mobile Edge DC

   From RAN to mobile edge DC, there is mobile backhaul transport
   network that provides connectivity between a client data device and
   one of the edge nodes in the Mobile Edge DC Domain. The backhaul
   transport networks provide tunnels for data transport for mobile
   applications. These tunnels are typically provisioned statically.
   This mobile backhaul transport network can be a resource bottle
   neck. Operators typically overprovision this backhaul network to
   accommodate unpredicted serge of data traffic.

   Resource abstraction is one of the missing operational mechanisms in
   mobile backhaul network. Resource abstraction will give the current
   network usage information to the operators and will help dynamic and
   elastic applications be provisioned dynamically with QoS guarantee.

   2. Transport from Mobile Edge DC to Mobile Core DC

   From Mobile Edge DC domain to Mobile Core DC domain, there is core
   transport network that provides connectivity between edges to core.
   As Mobile Core DC servers may be geographically spread for load
   balancing or for recovery, the selection of core DC location from
   edge constitutes a data center selection problem.

   To support dynamic and flexible connection setup for applications
   that are of dynamic nature with flexible bandwidth, network resource
   abstraction is needed to facilitate this operation.

   3. Transport from Mobile Edge DC to Internet Core Network

   From Mobile Edge DC domain to Internet Core Network, there is also
   core transport network that provides connectivity between edges to
   Internet core for Local traffic breakout (e.g. LIPA and SIPTO). As
   Mobile Edge DC servers may be geographically spread at the network
   edge side for load balancing, the selection of traffic from edge to
   Internet core is required to be controlled. See [3GPP TR 23.859] for
   related discussion.

Internet-Draft Multi-domain Mobile Virtual Network Operation March 2014


   4. Multi-layer Integration/Coordination (aka., POI)

   Within the core transport network domain, there is also a multi-
   layer issue between packet networks and optical transport networks.
   To support multi-layer routing and optimization, coordination
   between these two layers are necessary. Network abstraction of both
   packet and optical networks will be very useful to support different
   applications flexibly and efficiently. See [ACTN-POI] for related
   discussion.

   5. End-to-end tunnel/transport operations/management from RAN to
     Mobile Core DCN:

   As there are multiple transport domains (namely, Mobile backhaul and
   Core transport networks) involved for an end-to-end connectivity
   within an operator's network, the coordination between these domains
   are crucial for operation. Static provisioning with stitching
   tunnels are inadequate for many applications/services requiring
   strict QoS such as a guaranteed bandwidth and latency.

   In the current network environments, these two domains are not well
   coordinated due to various reasons including the lack of a global
   resource view, a domain administrative boundary, and the differences
   in transport technology and vendor equipment.

   In summary, due to complexity in mobile operator's network in terms
   of heterogeneous transport technology, organizational boundaries
   between domains, multi-vendor issues and others, facilitating
   connectivity that traverse the aforementioned multi-domains is not
   readily achieved.

   Each domain control establishing other domain control in a peer to
   peer level creates permutation issues for the end-to-end control.
   Besides, these domain controls are optimized for its local operation
   and in most cases not suited for controlling the end-to-end
   connectivity services.

   Moreover, the path computation for any end-to-end connection would
   need abstraction of network resources and ways to find an optimal
   path that meets the connection's service requirements. This would
   require knowledge of network abstraction and topology for all
   domains through which a connection traverses.

   For mobile networks, signaling is a complex issue as it involves not
   only a session control but also a connection control. The
   coordination between the session control and the connection control
   has to be worked out for a seamless operation.

Internet-Draft Multi-domain Mobile Virtual Network Operation March 2014


   From a network connectivity management perspective, it would require
   a mechanism to disseminate any connectivity issues from the local
   domain to the other domains whenever the local domain cannot resolve
   a connectivity issues.

3. Virtual Network Operations for Mobile Operators' Networks

   Based on the issues discussed in the previous section in regard to
   the operations for mobile multi-domain networks, there is a need to
   support a coordination that facilitates virtual network operation,
   the creation of a virtualized environment allowing operators to view
   the underlying radio access network, backhaul transport network,
   mobile DC edge, mobile DC core, packet/optical transport network for
   DC interconnect networks and their operation and management as a
   single, virtualized network.

   The basic premise of this virtual network operation is to create a
   hierarchy of operations in which to separate virtual network
   operations from physical network operations. This helps operators
   build virtual network operations infrastructure on top of physical
   network operations. Figure 2 shows a hierarchical structure of
   operations.

   |  Control |  |  Control |  |  Control |  | Control  |  | Control |
   +----------+  +----------+  +----------+  +----------+  +---------+


                 Figure 2. Mobile VN Operation Hierarchy

   Figure 2 shows operations hierarchy based on Figure 1. The two main
   ideas are:

   1. Domain control/management entities (e.g., RAN Control, Mobile
     Backhaul Network Control, Mobile Edge Data Center Network Control,
     Core Transport Network Control, Mobile Core Data Center Network
     Control) are kept intact to continue its domain operations with
     its technology choice and policy, etc. As discussed before domain


   Shin, et al.            Expires December 30, 2014  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft Multi-domain Mobile Virtual Network Operation March 2014


     control/management entities can be a form of various types (e.g.,
     SDN-controller, NMS/EMS, Control Plane, or a combination of these
     entities, etc.) that is responsible for domain-specific network
     operations.

   2. The VNO Coordinator establishes a standard-based API (which is
     termed as the Virtual Network Operations Interface (VNO-I) in
     Figure 2) with each of the domain control/management entities. The
     VNO coordination takes place via the VNO-I's.
