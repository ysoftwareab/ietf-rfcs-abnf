Abstract

   We present here a protocol in which edge network equipments, also 
   known as IP Services devices, Broadband RASes, and so forth, can 
   inform surrogates, network edge proxy servers or traffic 
   interception devices extended information about the user, such 
   as geographic location, QoS policy, fully qualified login 
   (name@domain.name) and start and stop times (or its equivalent 
   for non-session based users).

   The User Profile Information Protocol, herein called UPIF, allows
   services providers, access providers and content delivery 
   networks to provide personalized or differentiated treatment to each 
   user individually, and also to enhance accounting considerably.

1. Definitions

   User: A unique person that has access to the Internet or some other
   IP network. One or more user can be treated as a single
   subscriber.  

   Subscriber: A logical unit to which services are applied. It can
   be (but not limited to) a ATM VC, a IP address or a PPP session. A
   subscriber can composed of one of more users.  

   Subscriber Granularity: This is a measure of how accurate the  
   subscriber identification can be. 
   
       o If each subscriber corresponds to a unique user we can say 
       that this is the highest level of granularity the subscriber
       identification can reach. 
      
       o If each subscriber corresponds to a personal computer or any
       logical device that is shared by more than one person, we say
       that the network can provide a medium level granularity of
       subscriber identification. 
       
       o If each subscriber corresponds to a logical connection or 
       device that is shared by a company or corporation, we say that
       this is the lowest level granularity of subscriber
       identification.   

   Server: The Edge Device or any device in the network that has
   knowledge of the subscriber's profile, start and stop session times 
   and the correspondence between users and subscriber. 

   Client: A surrogate server, proxy server, raffic interception or 
   any other device in the network that is going to receive subscriber 
   profile information in order to provide customized services.  

2. Subscriber Awareness

   Today there is a new class of devices that sit on the edge of the
   network (between the access and the core), and represents the last 
   point on a network that there is subscriber awareness. One should 
   understand subscribers awareness as the capability to infer who is 
   the actual user on the network and his profile. 

   Examples of the identity of the user are (but not limited to) source 
   IP address or name@domain (PPPoE based) for Cable users, ATM VC or 
   name@domain (PPPoE or PPPoA based) for DSL users, name@domain (PPP 
   based) for dial-up subscribers, or IP network for leased line users. 

   The profile of the user may include (but is not limited to) QoS 
   parameters, geographic location, start and stop times (or its 
   equivalent for non-session based users) and IP address in use.

Internet-Draft     draft-penno-cdnp-nacct-userid-04.txt       July,2001


3. Subscriber Awareness and Personalized Services

   Since these devices know exactly who the subscriber is, they can
   control the access of these subscribers to the network and offer 
   personalized services on an per user basis. Example of these 
   services are (but not limited to) traffic shaping, Diffserv marking 
   and policing, firewall, VPNs, traffic steering (allowing some custom 
   applications, such as anti-virus scanning in some selected 
   subscriber's mail traffic), and personal portals. 

4. Personalized Services and Content Delivery
   
   There is a lot of effort going on to standardize methods for
   content-delivery, distribution, accounting and request-routing
   [3-8]. Although one can expect an major improvement on content
   delivery in general from this effort, these will be done on a coarse
   level. We believe that with the kind of information an Edge Device
   can pass to a surrogate server or a traffic interception device, the
   delivery and accounting of content can be done on a much more
   granular level, on a per subscriber basis. This open up a whole new
   set of possibilities for content delivery and personalization. 

5. Protocol Operation for Session based subscribers

   We present here a framework of how the protocol would work for
   session based subscriber. Session based subscribers include those 
   that access the network through one of the following (but not 
   limited to) protocols: Dial-up PPP, PPPoE, PPPoA and L2TP. 

                                             |------------|
                                         4,5 |Traffic     |
                                       ----->|Interception|
                               2,3    /      |Device      |
   |------|        1        |------|_/       |------------|
   | Subs |---->Access----->| Edge |
   |------|     Network     |Device|_
                            |------| \
                                      \  4,5 |---------|
                                       ----->|Surrogate|
                                             |or proxy |
                                             |Server   |
                                             |---------|

   1. The subscriber establishes a PPP session to the Edge Device 
   2. Edge device authenticates the subscriber locally or on an
      external server such as a Radius or LDAP database.
   3. If authentication successful, the Edge Device applies the 
      services associated to this subscriber profile to his session. 



Penno, et al.                                                  [Page 4]


Internet-Draft     draft-penno-cdnp-nacct-userid-04.txt       July,2001

   4. The Edge device then package some or all the information that it 
      has about the subscriber and sends it to one or more traffic 
      interception devices, surrogate or proxy servers. If the profile
      of the subscriber changes within a session, the Edge Device MAY 
      send a update message. 

   The type of information the edge device MAY send is start time of 
   the session, name@domain, Diffserv policy, IP address in use and 
   geographic location. Of course this can be expanded to accommodate 
   several other useful parameters.

   5.When the subscriber is disconnected, the edge device MUST inform
     (as appropriate) proxy servers, surrogate servers or traffic
     interception devices the stop time of the session, name@domain and 
     IP address that was in use. 

6. Protocol Operation for Non-Session based subscribers

   The framework for non-session based subscribers is the same as for 
   session based subscribers. What changes is the type of information 
   you can pass to other devices and the accuracy of identification of 
   the subscriber.

   For instance, if DSL provider A does not require that its users 
   access the network through some session based protocol such as 
   PPPoE, this means that a edge device could identify the subscriber 
   by ATM VC of his DSL modem or the source IP address of his personal 
   computer. 
    
   This method of course means that in the case of identification by 
   the ATM VC, all users behind the modem would be treated as the same 
   subscriber. They are invisible to the edge device. One way to 
   address this is to identify the subscriber by its source IP address 
   so that if there are several personal computers behind a DSL modem, 
   a edge device could apply different services to each one.

   The later solution also has a drawback when N:M NAT is used or when 
   several users share the same personal computer. The drawback when
   N:M NAT is used is pretty straightforward. Since there is a device 
   translating several source IP address into some other subset, this 
   implies a loss of granularity on the identification of the actual 
   user. 

   In the case where several users share the same personal computer, 
   there is no way to differentiate when a particular user stopped 
   using and a new one started. One solution could be the use of some 
   web login method (similar to web mail used today). In other words, 
   when user A sits on his shared personal computer, he has to go to a 
   specific web page and put his username and password, which would be 
   passed to the edge device, allowing it to accurately identify the 
   subscriber and apply his personalized services. 

Penno, et al.                                                  [Page 5]


Internet-Draft     draft-penno-cdnp-nacct-userid-04.txt       July,2001

   More on identification of users can be found in [11]

   In the cases where there is no web login, the start of the session
   would be when the first packet with a specific source IP address or 
   that through a specific ATM VC reaches the edge device. The stop of 
   the session would be based on some idle or session timeout.

7. Proposed Protocol

   The existing similarities between the User Profile Information 
   Protocol and the Radius Accounting Protocol [2] led us to define the
   UPIF based on the Radius Accounting Protocol definitions. The 
   similarities considered are:

   - The Radius Accounting Protocol is used to carry accounting 
     information between a Network Access Server and a shared
     Accounting server. The User Profile Information Protocol is used
     to carry profile information between an edge network equipment and
     a surrogate server or traffic interception device.

   - In the RADIUS Protocol, all transactions are comprised of variable
     length Attribute-Length-Value 3-tuples.  This characteristic and 
     the flexibility of adding new attributes suits the UPIF 
     requirements.

8.  Packet Format

   Exactly one UPIF packet is encapsulated in the UDP Data field [4],
   where the UDP Destination Port field indicates <port> (decimal).

   When a reply is generated, the source and destination ports are
   reversed.

   A summary of the UPIF data format is shown below.  The fields are
   transmitted from left to right.

    0                   1                   2                   3

Internet-Draft     draft-penno-cdnp-nacct-userid-04.txt       July,2001


   Code

      The Code field is one octet, and identifies the type of UPIF
      packet.  When a packet is received with an invalid Code field, it
      is silently discarded.

      UPIF Codes (decimal) are assigned as follows:

       1	Profile-Information
       2	Profile-Response

   Identifier

      The Identifier field is one octet, and aids in matching updates
      and replies.  The client can detect a duplicate request if
      it has the same client source IP address and source UDP port and
      Identifier within a short span of time.

   Length

      The Length field is two octets.  It indicates the length of the
      packet including the Code, Identifier, Length, Authenticator and
      Attribute fields.  Octets outside the range of the Length field
      MUST be treated as padding and ignored on reception.  If the
      packet is shorter than the Length field indicates, it MUST be
      silently discarded.  The minimum length is 20 and maximum length
      is 4095.

   Authenticator

      The Authenticator field is sixteen (16) octets.  The most
      significant octet is transmitted first.  This value is used to
      authenticate the messages between the UPIF Server to an UPIF
      client.

   Request Authenticator

      In Profile-Information Packets, the Authenticator value is a 16
      octet MD5 [12] checksum, called the Request Authenticator.












Penno, et al.                                                  [Page 7]


Internet-Draft     draft-penno-cdnp-nacct-userid-04.txt       July,2001


      All implementations of Request Authenticator MUST support manual
      keying. It is used extensively in RADIUS implementations. In
      manual keying, two sides agree on the secret to be used in the 
      MD5 checksum offline. The process of assigning the shared secret 
      is manual. Needless to say, this process is error-prone, 
      cumbersome, insecure, and does not scale. Another limiting factor 
      is that the trust relationship never expires. Once it is created, 
      it remains good until it is changed in both sides. Manual keying 
      is a useful feature for debugging the base UPIF protocol when the 
      key management protocol is failing. However, with a stable key 
      management protocol, the use of manual keying is questionable.

      In an environment where UPIF is deployed, manual keying
      implementation MUST be available. The availability of a key
      management protocol, such as ISAKMP [13], SHOULD be included.

      The UPIF client and server share a key. The Request Authenticator
      field in Profile-Information packets contains a one- way MD5 hash
      calculated over a stream of octets consisting of the Code + 
      Identifier + Length + 16 zero octets + request attributes + 
      shared secret (where + indicates concatenation).  The 16 octet 
      MD5 hash value is stored in the Authenticator field of the
      Profile-Information packet.

   Response Authenticator

      The Authenticator field in an Profile-Response packet is called
      the Response Authenticator, and contains a one-way MD5 hash
      calculated over a stream of octets consisting of the Profile-
      Response Code, Identifier, Length, the Request Authenticator 
      Field from the Profile-Information packet being replied to, and 
      the response attributes if any, followed by the shared secret. 
      The resulting 16 octet MD5 hash value is stored in the 
      Authenticator field of the Profile-Response packet.

      All the considerations about manual keying or the use of a key
      management protocol stated above are valid for the Response
      Authenticator implementation.

   Attributes

      Attributes may have multiple instances, in such a case the order
      of attributes of the same type SHOULD be preserved.  The order of
      attributes of different types is not required to be preserved.

9. Packet Types

   The UPIF packet type is determined by the Code field in the first
   octet of the packet.

9.1 Profile-Information 

   Description
   
      Profile-Information packets are used to transfer subscriber
      profile information from a UPIF Information Server (usually a 
      edge device) to a client (usually a traffic interception device, 
      surrogate or proxy server). This information is used to provide
      personalized content and services to the subscriber. The server
      transmits an UPIF packet with the Code field set to 1 
      (Information).

   A summary of the Update packet format is shown below.

   The fields are transmitted from left to right.

      for his session like (but not limited to) upstream and downstream
      bandwidth, diffserv marking and ISP Service package during a
      session. So the Interim-Update type would be used to indicate
      other devices in the network the the original profile informed
      for a particular subscriber have changed.

10.12 Geodetic-Granularity

   Description

      The geodetic location of anything on Earth may be indicated by
      its geodetic coordinates, which are Latitude and Longitude. The
      Geodetic-Granularity, Geodetic-Latitude, and Geodetic-Longitude
      attributes are used to define the actual position of a
      subscriber. But, there is no reason to know the exact location of
      a subscriber at a given time. Our purpose with this kind of
      identification is to gather some useful data based on location
      and to provide an even more personalized or regional content to
      all subscribers within our network. 

      Is is worth noticing that this attribute allows the delivery of 
      subscriber specific regional data even if the proxy or surrogate 
      server providing the content is not on the same area as 
      the subscriber. 

      A Geographic Information System (GIS) MAY be used to gather
      whatever information I may want based on geographic location
      linked to an appropriate database. Some statistical information
      about subscribers in a certain region, such as language, age,
      income, culture, and a myriad of other data can be useful to
      enhance the subscriber experience.

      The precision of the geographic position of a subscriber may vary
      depending on the identification requirements and available 
      information about some region in the planet.

      It would be quite complex to build a system which could map the 
      subscriber's latitude and longitude to a specific data with a 
      high level of accuracy. The definition of the latitude and
      longitude allows the specification of the precision needed in
      order to gather the required information from a GIS.

      The Geodetic-Granularity attribute defines the precision of the
      position information provided by the Geodetic-Latitude and
      Geodetic-Longitude attributes. The precision is defined by the
      number of seconds, which composes the "identification area",
      i.e., the larger area which contains all the information needed
      to provide the required subscriber's experience.

      The Geodetic-Granularity MAY vary from 1 to 60". The length of a
      degree of Geodetic Latitude or Geodetic Longitude varies from
      Equator to Pole. The term Geodetic (loosely speaking: Geographic)
      refers to the mathematical surface used to approximate the actual
      shape of the Earth, which is an ellipsoid. Each second defines an
      approximate 934 m^2 area, at a Latitude of 0 degrees.

10.15 Upstream-Bandwidth

   Description

      This Attribute indicates the Layer 3 upstream bandwidth 
      (subscriber->Internet) available to the subscriber in kbps. In 
      some networks such as xDSL this bandwidth may be the same as the 
      Layer 2 bandwidth available to the subscriber. 

      This attributes allows traffic interception devices to apply the
      same upstream bandwidth policy as the IP Services Switch. 

   A summary of the Upstream-Bandwidth attribute format is shown
   below. The fields are transmitted from left to right.

10.16 Downstream-Bandwidth

   Description

      This Attribute indicates the Layer 3 downstream bandwidth 
      (Internet->subscriber) available to the subscriber in kbps. In 
      some networks such as xDSL this bandwidth may be the same as the 
      Layer 2 bandwidth available to the subscriber. 

      This attributes allows traffic interception devices to apply the
      same downstream bandwidth policy as the IP Services Switch. This 
      attribute also allows surrogate and proxy servers to adapt the 
      requested web content to the users downstream bandwidth. If 
      adaption is not available it is possible to allow the user to see 
      the content anyway, present a web page suggesting that the user 
      upgrades his bandwidth or upgrade his bandwidth on-demand through 
      some signalling protocol between the proxy or surrogate server 
      and the IP Services Switch.

10.17 Subscriber-Src-Port

   Description

      In the case the service provider uses network address translation 
      [Reference TBD] and several private addresses are translated to a 
      single public address, using the source IP address (10.4) is not 
      a adequate method to uniquely identify data from a specific 
      subscriber.

      In order to uniquely identify data from a specific subscriber, is 
      necessary a combination of parameters 4 and 17, i.e., source IP 
      address and port.

      The port is the source TCP or UDP port number used in a 
      connection.

   A summary of the Subscriber-Port Attribute format is shown below.

11. Security Considerations 
 
   We are considering an environment where two or more companies are 
   sharing user information, most times over a public network. In such
   environments, confidentiality MAY be required, hence some values 
   SHOULD be transmitted encrypted.
  
   The encryption support may be object of later discussion about the 
   enhancements the UPIF may have.

13. Wish List

    The protocol can also be used as a anonymizer. Instead of users 
    that want privacy waste time logging into web sites with names like 
    "foobar" or "somename", the protocol can inform the profile broker 
    the privacy wishes of the user. What attributes would be needed to 
    accommodate this?

    I wonder if the QoS parameters need more granularity like burst 
    size, peak rate, delay, etc? In other words, a vocabulary more 
    inline with RSVP nomenclature.

    Since this protocol is based on Radius, I assume that a 
    implementation would be straightforward and knowledge will spread 
    fast, but on the other hand Radius is evolving to Diameter. Should 
    this protocol be more inline with Diameter?
