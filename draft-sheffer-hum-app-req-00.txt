                 Virtual Hum Application: Requirements
                      draft-sheffer-hum-app-req-00

Abstract

   The IETF has been having virtual meetings for a long time.  Until
   recently these have been interim meetings, and following the all-
   virtual IETF-107 we expect to see more and more WG meetings take the
   virtual route.  A common practice at the IETF is to use room
   "humming" to gauge working group consensus, though the final
   consensus is determined by the working group chairs and typically
   requires a mailing list poll as well.  We do not have a technique
   equivalent to the hum for virtual meetings, and arguably this reduces
   the effectiveness of these meetings.

   This document defines the requirements from a web application whose
   goal is to most faithfully replicate the "feel" of hums, through the
   use of a traditional web user interface.

1.  Introduction

   The IETF has been having virtual meetings for a long time.  Until
   recently these have been interim meetings, and following the all-
   virtual IETF-107 we expect to see more and more WG meetings take the
   virtual route.  A common practice at the IETF is to use room
   "humming" to gauge working group consensus, though the final
   consensus is determined by the working group chairs and typically
   requires a mailing list poll as well.  We do not have a technique
   equivalent to the hum for virtual meetings, and arguably, this
   reduces the effectiveness of these meetings.

   This document defines the requirements from a web application whose
   goal is to most faithfully replicate the "feel" of hums, through the
   use of a traditional web user interface.

Internet-Draft        Hum Application Requirements            April 2020


   The document's scope is strictly on the web application, and not on
   the process implications of humming or of replacing it by a different
   (though hopefully similar) human protocol.  Please refer to [RFC7282]
   for the authoritative discussion of what IETF consensus means, how it
   can be reached, and the role - as well as the limitations - of
   humming in achieving consensus.

1.1.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Background

   Note: the intended audience for this section is application
   developers who are not familiar with the IETF process.

   IETF, the Internet Engineering Task Force, is an important standards
   body for the Internet.  Its main product is RFC documents that define
   protocols.  For example, the IP protocol is defined by RFC 791, the
   HTTP protocol is defined by a series of RFCs, TLS 1.3 is defined by
   RFC 8446.  The IETF has a very long history and very detailed
   processes associated with its operation.  It has been holding 3
   annual face-to-face meetings for a very long time, and is only now
   moving more fully into virtual meetings.  In fact the first fully
   virtual IETF meeting is the upcoming IETF 107, taking place next week
   (at the time of writing).  The IETF consists of dozens of working
   groups, and they come to decisions using a process called "rough
   consensus" which means that most participants are in favor of a
   certain decision and there is no large faction against or an even
   smaller faction but with strongly held opinions.  Quoting "the Tao or
   the IETF":

   4.2 Getting Things Done in a Working Group

   One fact that confuses many newcomers is that the face-to-face WG
   meetings are much less important in the IETF than they are in most
   other organizations.  Any decision made at a face-to-face meeting
   must also gain consensus on the WG mailing list.

   There are numerous examples of important decisions made in WG
   meetings that are later overturned on the mailing list, often because
   someone who couldn't attend the meeting pointed out a serious flaw in
   the logic used to come to the decision.  Finally, WG meetings aren't

   "drafting sessions", as they are in some other standards bodies: in
   the IETF, drafting is done elsewhere.

   Another aspect of Working Groups that confounds many people is the
   fact that there is no formal voting.  The general rule on disputed
   topics is that the Working Group has to come to "rough consensus",
   meaning that a very large majority of those who care must agree.  The
   exact method of determining rough consensus varies from Working Group
   to Working Group.  Sometimes consensus is determined by "humming" -
   if you agree with a proposal, you hum when prompted by the chair.
   Most "hum" questions come in two parts: you hum to the first part if
   you agree with the proposal, or you hum to the second part if you
   disagree with the proposal.  Newcomers find it quite peculiar, but it
   works.  It is up to the chair to decide when the Working Group has
   reached rough consensus.

   The lack of formal voting has caused some very long delays for some
   proposals, but most IETF participants who have witnessed rough
   consensus after acrimonious debates feel that the delays often result
   in better protocols.  (And, if you think about it, how could you have
   "voting" in a group that invites all interested individuals to
   participate, and when it's impossible to count the participants?)
   Rough consensus has been defined in many ways; a simple version is
   that it means that strongly held objections must be debated until
   most people are satisfied that these objections are wrong.

   See also this article [Coldewey] for another view on the humming
   practice.

   With the move to virtual meetings, real audio-based humming is no
   longer an option.  We would like to develop a replacement that
   preserves as much as possible of the spirit behind this practice but
   is workable for widely distributed virtual working group meetings.

3.  General Requirements

   This is a relatively simple web application.  It needs to be usable
   by people who are seeing it for the first time (meeting participants)
   or people who have had very minimal practice and need to operate it
   under pressure (working group chairs).

   *  Administration requires a desktop browser.
   *  Nice to have: participation from a mobile browser.
   *  Nice to have: OpenID authentication for admins.

4.  Hum Rooms

   Anybody can open a "hum room".  The room is available for a period of
   time (default: 6 hours) and then it is archived.  The room consists
   of:

   *  A name, defined by the room admin.
   *  A secret, random management URL, which may be shared with 2-3
      additional admins, and visible to the IETF Secretariat.
   *  A secret, random participation URL, which will be shared with all
      participants (should allow up to 500).  After the room is
      archived, the archive view will be returned, as the URL will wind
      up in minutes.
   *  Configuration: the expected number of participants.  Entered by
      admins, visible to all participants.  (Note: this value may not be
      needed, this depends on the exact rules we define for gauging
      consensus).
   *  A list of questions, see below.  Some analytics, including the
      total number of participants seen, the total number of hums taken,
      number of unique IPs etc.  Analytics are open to all participants.
   *  Expiry time of the room.
   *  A "get summary" button that enables downloading (e.g. as JSON) a
      summary of all analytics, questions and results, so they can be
      used in the meeting minutes.  This button is available to
      everybody.
   *  A way to close the room even before it has expired.  Available
      only to admins.

5.  Hum Questions

   Questions are typically entered on-the-fly by the admin, during the
   meeting.  So the interface must be very minimal/simple.

   *  Introductory text (up to 2-3 lines of text).
   *  Between 2-4 options, with text and a button for each.  "I don't
      understand the question" shall be suggested as one of the options,
      however it should be possible to delete it.
   *  A link or popup with the detailed rules for consensus for this
      question, visible to all participants.

   For example:

   Should we require encryption of all HTTP traffic, as a MUST?

   Yes [button]

   No [button]

   Don't have enough information [button] (This is not the same as
                                   "I don't understand the question")

   *  Questions are visible to all participants as soon as they are
      entered (even keystroke by keystroke), similarly to Etherpad/hack-
      MD.
   *  Buttons become available only when the admin enables the question.
   *  Buttons are available for a short duration, e.g. 3 minutes
   *  Buttons are treated as toggles, i.e. a second press disables the
      selection.
   *  People are allowed to press more than one button (this is weird
      but it replicates the hum experience).
   *  All participants see an indicator (e.g. progress bar) of how much
      time remains.

6.  Gauging Consensus

   When the time expires for a question, each option is evaluated
   separately:

   *  Zero responses: silence.
   *  Less than 20% of the total number of people who responded: weak
      hum.
   *  20-70%: medium hum.
   *  70-100%: strong hum.

   Only the summary (e.g. "medium hum") is displayed/retained, not the
   exact numbers.  In addition, we display the total number of
   responses.

   Admins (working group chairs) are expected to announce the results to
   the protocol, and decide whether consensus has been reached, before
   moving on to the next question.

7.  Graphics/UI

   Please include the IETF logo, https://www.ietf.org/logo/.

8.  Transport Security

   *  HTTPS, and redirection from HTTP to HTTPS.

   *  Please use Let's Encrypt for certificates.  You should probably
      use the Certbot client.
   *  The server should have scheduled code that fetches a new
      certificate automatically 2 weeks before the cert expires.
   *  To authorize the server to Let's Encrypt, use the HTTP-01
      challenge.

9.  Security, Access Control, Fraud

   Basically none.  Counting unique IPs allows for detection of simple-
   minded fraud.

10.  IANA Considerations

   This is a process document, with no IANA implications.

11.  Security Considerations

   The process described here may have operational security
   considerations related to the IETF process, but none that apply
   directly to any IETF deliverables.

12.  Privacy Considerations

   IETF processes are not expected to ensure anonymity of participants.
   The process described here does not make any changes to the existing
   privacy guarantees.

13.  Acknowledgements

   I would like to thank Michael Richardson for his extensive comments
   to a previous version of this document.
