                     for Segment Routing Networks
               draft-gandhi-spring-rfc6374-srpm-udp-02

Abstract

   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm.  Segment
   Routing (SR) is applicable to both Multiprotocol Label Switching
   (SR-MPLS) and IPv6 (SRv6) data planes.  This document specifies
   procedures for using UDP path for sending and processing probe query
   and response messages for Performance Measurement (PM).  The
   procedure uses the mechanisms defined in RFC 6374 for Performance
   Delay and Loss Measurement.  The procedure specified is applicable to
   SR-MPLS and SRv6 data planes for both links and end-to-end
   measurement for SR Policies.

1.  Introduction

   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm and
   greatly simplifies network operations for Software Defined Networks
   (SDNs).  SR is applicable to both Multiprotocol Label Switching
   (SR-MPLS) and IPv6 (SRv6) data planes.  SR takes advantage of the
   Equal-Cost Multipaths (ECMPs) between source and transit nodes,
   between transit nodes and between transit and destination nodes.  SR
   Policies as defined in [I-D.spring-segment-routing-policy] are used
   to steer traffic through a specific, user-defined paths using a stack
   of Segments.  Built-in SR Performance Measurement (PM) is one of the
   essential requirements to provide Service Level Agreements (SLAs).

   The One-Way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP) defined in [RFC4656]
   and Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) defined in [RFC5357]
   provide capabilities for the measurement of various performance
   metrics in IP networks.  These protocols rely on control-channel
   signaling to establish a test-channel over an UDP path.  These
   protocols lack support for IEEE 1588 timestamp [IEEE1588] format and
   direct-mode Loss Measurement (LM), which are required in SR networks
   [RFC6374].  The Simple Two-way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP)
   [I-D.ippm-stamp] alleviates the control-channel signaling by using
   configuration data model to provision a test-channel.  In addition,
   the STAMP supports IEEE 1588 timestamp format for Delay Measurement
   (DM).  The TWAMP Light [Appendix I in RFC5357] [BBF.TR-390] provides
   simplified mechanisms for active performance measurement in Customer
   IP networks by provisioning UDP paths and eliminates the
   control-channel signaling.  [Y1731] specifies the mechanisms to carry
   OAM messages specifically for Ethernet networks that include Ethernet
   Frame Delay and Loss measurements.

   [RFC6374] specifies protocol mechanisms to enable the efficient and
   accurate measurement of performance metrics and can be used in SR
   networks with MPLS data plane [I-D.spring-rfc6374-srpm-mpls].

Internet-Draft   RFC 6374 UDP Path for Segment Routing   October 4, 2019


   [RFC6374] addresses the limitations of the IP based performance
   measurement protocols as specified in Section 1 of [RFC6374].  The
   [RFC6374] requires data plane to support MPLS Generic Associated
   Channel Label (GAL) and Generic Associated Channel (G-Ach), which may
   not be supported on all nodes in the network.  

   [RFC7876] specifies the procedures to be used when sending and
   processing out-of-band performance measurement probe response
   messages over an UDP return path for RFC 6374 based probe queries. 
   [RFC7876] can be used to send out-of-band PM probe responses in both
   SR-MPLS and SRv6 networks for one-way performance measurement.

   For SR Policies, there are ECMPs between the source and transit
   nodes, between transit nodes and between transit and destination
   nodes.  Existing PM protocols (e.g. RFC 6374) do not define handling
   for ECMP forwarding paths in SR networks.

   For two-way measurements for SR Policies, there is a need to specify
   a return path in the form of a Segment List in PM probe query
   messages without requiring any SR Policy state on the destination
   node.  Existing protocols do not have such mechanisms to specify
   return path in the PM probe query messages.

   This document specifies a procedure for sending and processing probe
   query and response messages using UDP paths for Performance
   Measurement in SR networks.  The procedure uses RFC 6374 defined
   mechanisms for Performance Delay and Loss Measurement and unless
   otherwise specified, the procedures from RFC 6374 are not modified. 
   The procedure specified is applicable to both SR-MPLS and SRv6 data
   planes.  The procedure can be used for both SR links and end-to-end
   performance measurement for SR Policies and it does not require to
   bootstrap PM sessions.

2.3.  Reference Topology

   In the reference topology shown below, the sender node R1 initiates a

   response may be sent to the sender node R1 or to a controller node
   R100.  The nodes R1 and R5 may be directly connected via a link
   enabled with Segment Routing or there exists a Point-to-Point (P2P)
   SR Policy [I-D.spring-segment-routing-policy] on node R1 with
   destination to node R5.  In case of Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP), SR
   Policy originating from source node R1 may terminate on multiple
   destination leaf nodes [I-D.spring-sr-p2mp-policy].

3.  Overview

   One-way delay and two-way delay measurement procedure defined in
   Section 2.4 of [RFC6374] are used.  Transmit and Receive packet loss
   measurement procedures defined in Section 2.2 and Section 2.6 of
   [RFC6374] are used.  One-way loss measurement provides receive packet
   loss whereas two-way loss measurement provides both transmit and
   receive packet loss.  Separate UDP destination port numbers are
   user-configured for delay and loss measurements from the range
   specified in [I-D.ippm-stamp].  The sender uses the destination UDP
   port number following the guidelines specified in Section 6 in
   [RFC6335].  For both links and end-to-end SR Policies, no PM session
   for delay or loss measurement is created on the responder node R5
   [RFC6374].  

   For Performance Measurement, probe query and response messages are
   sent as following:

   o  For Delay Measurement, the probe messages are sent on the
      congruent path of the data traffic by the sender node, and are
      used to measure the delay experienced by the actual data traffic
      flowing on the links and SR Policies.

   o  For Loss Measurement, the probe messages are sent on the congruent

      path of the data traffic by the sender node, and are used to
      collect the receive traffic counters for the incoming link or
      incoming SID where the probe query messages are received at the
      responder node (incoming link or incoming SID needed since the
      responder node does not have PM session state present).

   The In-Situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM)
   mechanisms for SR-MPLS defined in [I-D.spring-ioam-sr-mpls] and for
   SRv6 defined in [I-D.spring-ioam-srv6] are used to carry PM
   information such as timestamp in-band as part of the data packets,
   and are outside the scope of this document.

   In this document, UDP path is used for Delay and Loss measurements
   for SR links and end-to-end SR Policies for the probe messages
   defined in [RFC6374].  The user-configured destination UDP ports
   (separate UDP ports for different delay and loss message formats) are
   used for identifying the PM probe packets. 		 	
4.1.1.  Delay Measurement Probe Query Message

   The message content for Delay Measurement for probe query message
   using UDP header [RFC768] is shown in Figure 1.  The DM probe query
   message is sent with user-configured Destination UDP port number for
   DM.  The Destination UDP port can also be used as Source port for
   two-way delay measurement, since the message has a flag to
   distinguish between query and response.  The DM probe query message
   contains the payload format for delay measurement defined in Section
   3.2 of [RFC6374].

   It is recommended to use the IEEE 1588v2 Precision Time Protocol
   (PTP) truncated 64-bit timestamp format [IEEE1588] as a default
   format as specified in Appendix A of [RFC6374], preferred with
   hardware support.  As an alternative, Network Time Protocol (NTP)
   timestamp format can also be used [RFC6374].

4.1.2.  Loss Measurement Probe Query Message

   The message content for Loss measurement probe query message using
   UDP header [RFC768] is shown in Figure 2.  As shown, the LM probe
   query message is sent with user-configured Destination UDP port
   number for LM.  Separate Destination UDP ports are used for
   direct-mode and inferred-mode loss measurements.  The Destination UDP
   port can also be used as Source port for two-way loss measurement,

   For delay measurement of SRv6 Policy using SRH, END function END.OTP
   [I-D.6man-srv6-oam] is used with the target SRv6 SID to punt probe
   messages on the target node, as shown in Figure 4.  Similarly, for
   loss measurement of SRv6 Policy, END function END.OP
   [I-D.6man-srv6-oam] is used with target SRv6 SID to punt probe
   messages on the target node.

4.2.  Probe Response Message

   When the received probe query message does not contain any UDP Return

      Figure 6: Probe Response Message Using URO from Probe Query

4.2.1.  One-way Measurement Mode 

4.2.1.1.  SR Links and End-to-end Measurement for SR Policy

   In one-way performance measurement mode, the probe response message
   as defined in Figure 5 or Figure 6 is sent out-of-band to the sender
   node, for both SR links and SR Policies.

   The PM sender node can receive probe response message back by setting
   its own IP address as Source Address of the header or by adding URO
   TLV in the probe query message and setting its own IP address in the
   IP Address in the URO TLV (Type=131) [RFC7876].  The "control code"
   in the probe query message is set to "out-of-band response
   requested".  The "Source Address" TLV (Type 130), and "Return
   Address" TLV (Type 1), if present in the probe query message, are not
   used to send probe response message.

4.2.1.2.  Probe Response Message to Controller

   As shown in the Reference Topology, if the sender node requires the
   probe response message to be sent to the controller R100, it adds URO
   TLV in the probe query message and sets the IP address of R100 in the
   IP Address field and user-configured UDP port for DM and for LM in
   the UDP-Destination-Port field of the URO TLV (Type=131) [RFC7876].

4.2.2.  Two-way Measurement Mode 

4.2.2.1.  SR Links

   In two-way performance measurement mode, when using a bidirectional
   link, the probe response message as defined in Figure 5 or Figure 6
   is sent back on the congruent path of the data traffic to the sender
   node for SR links.  In this case, the "control code" in the probe
   query message is set to "in-band response requested" [RFC6374].

4.2.2.2.  End-to-end Measurement for SR Policy

   In two-way performance measurement mode, when using a bidirectional
   path, the probe response message is sent back on the congruent path
   of the data traffic to the sender node for end-to-end measurement of
   SR Policies.  In this case, the "control code" in the probe query
   message is set to "in-band response requested" [RFC6374].

4.2.2.3.  Return Path TLV

   For two-way performance measurement, the sender node can request the
   responder node to send a response message back on a given reverse
   path (e.g. co-routed path for two-way measurement).  Return Path TLV
   defined in [I-D.spring-rfc6374-srpm-mpls] is used to carry reverse SR
   path information as part of the payload of the probe query message.

   Additional Segment List Sub-TLVs are defined in this document for the
   Return Path TLV for the following Types:

   o  Type (value TBD4): SRv6 Segment List of the Reverse SR Path

   o  Type (value TBD5): SRv6 Binding SID [I-D.pce-binding-label-sid] of
      the Reverse SR Policy

   The message content for sending probe response message on the
   congruent path of the data traffic for two-way end-to-end performance
   measurement of an SR-MPLS Policy is shown in Figure 8.  The SR-MPLS
   label stack in the packet header is built using the Segment List
   received in the Return Path TLV in the probe query message.

4.2.3.  Loopback Measurement Mode

   The Loopback measurement mode defined in Section 2.8 of [RFC6374] can
   be used to measure round-trip delay of a bidirectional SR Path.  The
   IP header of the probe query message contains the destination address
   equals to the sender address and the source address equals to the
   responder address.  Optionally, the probe query message can carry the
   reverse path information (e.g. reverse path label stack for SR-MPLS)
   as part of the SR header.  The responder node does not process the PM
   probe messages and generate response messages.


5.  Performance Measurement for P2MP SR Policies

   The procedures for delay and loss measurement described in this
   document for Point-to-Point (P2P) SR Policies
   [I-D.spring-segment-routing-policy] are also equally applicable to
   the Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) SR Policies
   [I-D.spring-sr-p2mp-policy] as following:

   o  The sender root node sends probe query messages using the either
 


Gandhi, et al.           Expires April 6, 2020                 [Page 14]

Internet-Draft   RFC 6374 UDP Path for Segment Routing   October 4, 2019


      Spray P2MP segment or TreeSID P2MP segment defined in
      [I-D.spring-sr-p2mp-policy] over the P2MP SR Policy.

   o  The sender root node sets the PM probe query message Destination
      IPv4 Address from the 127/8 range for SR-MPLS Policy.

   o  Each responder leaf node sends its IP address in the Source
      Address of the probe response messages.  This allows the sender
      root node to identify the responder leaf nodes of the P2MP SR
      Policy.

   o  The P2MP root node measures the end-to-end delay and loss
      performance for each P2MP leaf node.


6.  ECMP Support for SR Policies

   An SR Policy can have ECMPs between the source and transit nodes,
   between transit nodes and between transit and destination nodes. 
   Usage of Anycast SID [RFC8402] by an SR Policy can result in ECMP
   paths via transit nodes part of that Anycast group.  The PM probe
   messages need to be sent to traverse different ECMP paths to measure
   performance delay of an SR Policy.  

   Forwarding plane has various hashing functions available to forward
   packets on specific ECMP paths.  Following mechanisms can be used in
   PM probe messages to take advantage of the hashing function in
   forwarding plane to influence the path taken by them.

   o  The mechanisms described in [RFC8029] and [RFC5884] for handling
      ECMPs are also applicable to the performance measurement.  In the
      IP/UDP header of the PM probe messages, Destination Addresses in
      127/8 range for IPv4 or 0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:7F00/104 range for IPv6 can
      be used to exercise a particular ECMP path.  As specified in
      [RFC6437], 3-tuple of Flow Label, Source Address and Destination
      Address fields in the IPv6 header can also be used.

   o  For SR-MPLS Policy, entropy label [RFC6790] can be used in the PM
      probe messages.

   o  For SRv6 Policy using SRH, Flow Label in the SRH
      [I-D.6man-segment-routing-header] of the PM probe messages can be
      used.


7.  Sequence Numbers

   The message formats for DM and LM [RFC6374] can carry either

Internet-Draft   RFC 6374 UDP Path for Segment Routing   October 4, 2019


   timestamp or sequence number but not both.  There are case where both
   timestamp and sequence number are desired for both DM and LM. 
   Sequence numbers can be useful when some probe query messages are
   lost or they arrive out of order.  In addition, the sequence numbers
   can be useful for detecting denial-of-service (DoS) attacks on UDP
   ports.

7.1.  Sequence Number TLV in Unauthenticated Mode

   [RFC6374] defines DM and LM probe query and response messages that
   can include one or more optional TLVs.  New TLV Type (value TBA1) is
   defined in this document to carry sequence number for probe query and
   response messages for delay and loss measurement.  The format of the
   Sequence Number TLV in unauthenticated mode is shown in Figure 10.

          Figure 10: Sequence Number TLV - Unauthenticated Mode

   o  The sequence numbers start with 0 and are incremented by one for
      each subsequent probe query packet.  

   o  The sequence number are independent for DM and LM messages.

   o  The sequence number can be of any length determined by the sender
      node.  

   o  The Sequence Number TLV is optional.  

   o  The PM sender node SHOULD only insert one Sequence Number TLV in
      the probe query message and the responder node in the probe
      response message SHOULD return the first Sequence Number TLV from
      the probe query message and ignore the other Sequence Number TLVs
      if present.  

   o  When Sequence Number TLV is added, the DM and LM messages SHOULD
      NOT carry sequence number in the timestamp field of the message.

   The PM probe query and response packet format in authenticated mode
   includes a key Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC) ([RFC2104])
   hash.  Each probe query and response messages are authenticated by
   adding Sequence Number with Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC)
   TLV.  It can use HMAC-SHA-256 truncated to 128 bits (similarly to the
   use of it in IPSec defined in [RFC4868]); hence the length of the
   HMAC field is 16 octets.

   In authenticated mode, only the sequence number is encrypted, and the
   other payload fields are sent in clear text.  The probe packet MAY
   include Comp.MBZ (Must Be Zero) variable length field to align the
   packet on 16 octets boundary.

   The computation of HMAC field using HMAC-SHA1 [RFC5357] can be used
   with the procedure defined in this document.  HMAC uses own key and
   the definition of the mechanism to distribute the HMAC key is outside
   the scope of this document.  Both the authentication type and key can
   be user-configured on both the sender and responder nodes.

   The format of the Sequence Number TLV in authentication mode is shown
   in Figure 11.

           Figure 11: Sequence Number TLV - Authenticated Mode


   o  This TLV is mandatory in the authenticated mode.  

   o  The node MUST discard the probe message if HMAC is invalid.

   o  The Sequence Number follows the same processing rule as defined in
      the unauthenticated mode.

8.  Additional Message Processing Rules

8.1.  TTL Value

   The TTL or the Hop Limit field in the IP, MPLS and SRH headers of the
   probe query messages are set to 255.

   When using the Destination IPv4 Address from the 127/8 range, the TTL
   in the IPv4 header is set to 1 [RFC8029].  Similarly, when using the
   Destination IPv6 Address from the 0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:7F00/104 range, the
   Hop Limit field in the inner IPv6 header is set to 1 whereas in the
   outer IPv6 header is set to 255.

8.2.  Router Alert Option

   The Router Alert IP option is not set when using the routable
   Destination IP Address in the probe messages.

   When using the Destination IPv4 Address from the 127/8 range, the
   Router Alert IP Option of value 0x0 [RFC2113] for IPv4 is set in the
   IP header [RFC8029].  Similarly, when using the Destination IPv6
   Address from the 0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:7F00/104 range, the Router Alert IP
   Option of value 69 [RFC7506] for IPv6 is set in the IP header.

8.3.  UDP Checksum

   The Checksum Complement for delay and loss measurement messages
   follows the procedure defined in [RFC7820] and can be optionally used
   with the procedures defined in this document.

   For IPv4 and IPv6 probe messages, where the hardware is not capable
   of re-computing the UDP checksum or adding checksum complement
   [RFC7820], the sender node sets the UDP checksum to 0 [RFC6936]
   [RFC8085].  The receiving node bypasses the checksum validation and
   accepts the packets with UDP checksum of 0 for the UDP port being
   used for PM.


9.  Security Considerations

   The performance measurement is intended for deployment in
   well-managed private and service provider networks.  As such, it
   assumes that a node involved in a measurement operation has
   previously verified the integrity of the path and the identity of the
   far end responder node.  The security considerations described in
   Section 8 of [RFC6374] are applicable to this specification, and
   particular attention should be paid to the last three paragraphs.

 


Gandhi, et al.           Expires April 6, 2020                 [Page 18]

Internet-Draft   RFC 6374 UDP Path for Segment Routing   October 4, 2019


   If desired, attacks can be mitigated by performing basic validation
   and sanity checks, at the sender, of the counter or timestamp fields
   in received measurement response messages.  The minimal state
   associated with these protocols also limits the extent of measurement
   disruption that can be caused by a corrupt or invalid message to a
   single query/response cycle.

   Use of HMAC-SHA-256 in the authenticated mode defined in this
   document protects the data integrity of the probe messages.  SRv6 has
   HMAC protection authentication defined for SRH
   [I-D.6man-segment-routing-header].  Hence, PM probe messages for SRv6
   may not need authentication mode.  Cryptographic measures may be
   enhanced by the correct configuration of access-control lists and
   firewalls.


10.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate the values for the following Sub-TLV
   Types for the Return Path TLV for RFC 6374.

      o  Type TBD4: SRv6 Segment List of the Reverse SR Path

      o  Type TBD5: SRv6 Binding SID of the Reverse SR Policy


   IANA is also requested to allocate the values for the following
   Sequence Number TLV Types for RFC 6374 to be carried in the PM probe
   query and response messages for delay and loss measurement:

      o  Type TBA1: Sequence Number TLV in Unauthenticated Mode

      o  Type TBA2: Sequence Number TLV in Authenticated Mode
