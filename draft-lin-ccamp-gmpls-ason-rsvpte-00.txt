3. Introduction 
    
   The GMPLS suite of protocol specifications has been defined to 
   provide support for different technologies as well as different 
   applications. These include support for requesting TDM connections 
   based on SDH/SONET as well as Optical Transport Networks (OTNs), and 
   for setting up connections with monitoring capabilities. However, 
   there are certain capabilities that are needed to support 
   applications as described in ITU-T ASTN (Automatically Switched 
   Transport Networks) Requirements [G807], ASON (Automatically Switched 
   Optical Networks) Architecture and Requirements [G8080], Distributed 
   Connection Management [G7713] and Automatic Discovery [G7714]. These 
   include generic capabilities such as call and connection separation 
   and more specific capabilities such as support of soft permanent 
   connections.  
    
   This document concentrates on the signaling aspects of the GMPLS 
   suite of protocols, specifically GMPLS signaling using RSVP-TE. It 
   introduces extensions to GMPLS RSVP-TE to support the capabilities as 
   specified in the above referenced documents. Specifically, this 
   document assumes the messages and objects defined by [RFC2205], 
   [RFC2961], [RFC3209], [GMPLS-SIG], [GMPLS-RSVPTE], [GMPLS-SDHSONET], 
   [GMPLS-SDHSONETEXT], [GMPLS-OTN] and [OIF-UNI1] as the basis for the 
   protocols, with extensions in addition to those already defined by 
   these referenced documents.  
    
    
3.1 Relationship of ASON to GMPLS 
    
   The Automatic Switched Optical Network (ASON) architecture (as 
   specified by various ITU-T Recommendations) describes the application

                        GMPLS RSVP-TE for ASON               June 2002 
 
 
   of an automated control plane for supporting connection management 
   services for the transport/data plane. The ASON architecture is 
   described based on the functions supported, and the interactions of 
   various functions with each other. These include specification of the 
   call and connection controllers, as well as link resource managers 
   (for a detailed description see [G8080]). The ASON control plane 
   specification is meant to be applicable to different transport 
   technologies (e.g., SDH/SONET, OTN) in various networking 
   environments (e.g., inter-carrier, intra-carrier), supporting 
   different interface models between networks (e.g., Interior NNI (I-
   NNI), Exterior NNI (E-NNI), UNI). The modeling framework provided in 
   ITU-T may be used as a foundation for developing and/or extending the 
   protocols to support specific functions of ASON. A full description 
   of the relationship of ASON to GMPLS may be found in [IPO-RQTS] in 
   addition to more details concerning some of the terms used in this 
   document.  
    
   Automation of the connection management services may be realized in a 
   number of ways, including the use of the suite of GMPLS protocols to 
   support distributed connection management.  
    
    
3.2 Applicability of GMPLS to ASON 
    
   Most of the applicability statements regarding how the GMPLS suite of 
   protocols may be applied to the ASON architecture may be found in 
   [IPO-RQTS], which includes a summary of the key requirements from the 
   ITU-T ASON Recommendations, as well as a discussion of the 
   applicability of the GMPLS protocol suite. In addition to the above 
   referenced document, [ASSESS] provides a detailed assessment of 
   requirements against the GMPLS RSVP-TE protocol. In general, as 
   currently defined the GMPLS RSVP-TE protocol is applicable to the 
   ASON model. The purpose of this document is to define the additional 
   methods and objects (i.e. the delta) to fulfill some of the specific 
   requirements of the ASON model. 
    
    
3.3 Soft Permanent Connection (SPC): A Synopsis 
    
   An SPC is a combination of a permanent connection at the source user-
   to-network side, a permanent connection at the destination user-to-
   network side, and a switched connection within the network. 
   Establishment of the switched connection within the network is 
   typically initiated by an EMS or NMS, which communicates with the 
   ingress node and instructs it to set-up the connection using the 
   distributed signaling protocol (in this case GMPLS RSVP-TE signaling 

  
Lin            draft-lin-ccamp-gmpls-ason-rsvpte-00.txt              3 

                        GMPLS RSVP-TE for ASON               June 2002 
 
 
   is used to set up the connection between ingress and egress network 
   node). For the SPC, the communication method between the EMS/NMS and 
   the ingress node is not the subject of standardization and is, thus, 
   beyond the scope of this document. 
    
   The user end-to-end connection is thus created by associating the 
   incoming interface of the ingress network node with the switched 
   connection within the network and the outgoing interface of the 
   egress network node. An SPC connection is illustrated in the 
   following Figure, which shows user's node A connected to a provider's 
   node B via link #1, user's node Z connected to a provider's node Y 
   via link #3, and a (abstract) link #2 connecting provider's node B 
   and node Y.  
    
   +---+     +---+               +---+     +---+ 
   | A |--1--| B |-----2-//------| Y |--3--| Z | 
   +---+     +---+               +---+     +---+ 
    
   In this instance, the connection on link #1 and link #3 are both 
   provisioned, i.e., they are set up by means beyond the distributed 
   control plane. In contrast, the connection over link #2 is set up 
   using the distributed control plane. Thus the SPC is composed of the 
   concatenation of link #1, #2 and #3.  
    
    
3.4 Call: A Synopsis 
    
   A call may be simply described as: "An association between endpoints 
   that supports an instance of a service" [G8080]. Thus it provides an 
   abstract relationship between two users, where this relationship 
   describes (or verifies) the extent to which the users are willing to 
   offer (or accept) service to each other. A call therefore does not 
   provide the actual connectivity for transmitting user traffic, but 
   only builds a relationship by which future connections may be made. 
    
   A property of a call is its ability to contain multiple connections, 
   where each connection may be of different types and where each 
   connection may exist independently of other connections within the 
   call, i.e., each connection is setup and released with separate 
   Path/Resv messages. For example, a call may contain a mix of basic 
   connection, virtual concatenated connections and contiguous 
   concatenated connections (see [GMPLS-SDHSONET] for corresponding 
   connection signaling extensions). 
    



  
Lin            draft-lin-ccamp-gmpls-ason-rsvpte-00.txt              4 

                        GMPLS RSVP-TE for ASON               June 2002 
 
 
   The concept of the call is needed in order to allow for a better 
   flexibility in how users set up connections and how service providers 
   offer services to users. In essence, a call allows: 
    
   -    Support for a general case of virtual concatenation where each 
        connection can travel on different diverse paths 
   -    Better upgrading strategy for service provider control plane 
        operation, where a call control (service provisioning) may be 
        separate from switches and connections (where the connection 
        control may reside) 
   -    Verification and authentication of a call (with both network 
        call controller as well as destination user) prior to 
        connection, which may result in less wasted resources 
   -    General treatment of multiple connections which may be 
        associated for the purpose of protection and restoration; for 
        example a pair of primary and backup connections may belong to 
        the same call. 
    
   There is a relationship of the CALL_ID to the CIRCUIT_ID as presented 
   in [LBM-TDM]; however note that a call may contain multiple circuits, 
   and as such has wider scope than the circuit ID. 
    
   Consequently, a call (referenced by a CALL_ID) may include more than 
   one circuit (referenced by CIRCUIT_ID), i.e., a call can encompass 
   several contiguously concatenated connections and virtually 
   concatenated connections.  
    
    
4. Support for Soft Permanent Connection 
    
   In the scope of ASON, to support soft permanent connection (SPC) for 
   RSVP-TE, one new sub-type for the GENERALIZED_UNI is defined. The 
   GENERALIZED_UNI object is defined in [OIF-UNI1]. This new sub-type 
   has the same format and structure as the EGRESS_LABEL (the sub-type 
   is the suggested value for the new sub-object): 
    
   - SPC_LABEL (Type=4, Sub-type=2 [TBA]) 
    
    
5. Support for Call 
    
5.1 Call Identifier and Call Capability 
    
5.1.1 Call Identifier

                        GMPLS RSVP-TE for ASON               June 2002 
 
 
   To identify a call, a new object is defined for RSVP-TE. The CALL_ID 
   object carries the call identifier. The value is globally unique, and 
   may be assigned by the call originator (the Class-num is the 
   suggested value for the new object): 
    
   CALL_ID (Class-num = 227 [TBA], C-type = 1) 
    
    0                   1                   2                   3 
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |            Length             |Class-Num (227)|    C-Type     | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |                        Call identifier                        | 
   ~                              ...                              ~ 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
    
   Where the following C-types are defined: 
    
   - C-type = 1: generic [Length*4-32]-bit identifier 
    
   An example structure for the call identifier (to guarantee global 
   uniqueness) is to concatenate the tuple (source address, destination 
   address, local identifier) or (source address, local identifier) as 
   the call identifier. As an example, the address may be 160-bit field. 
   The minimum length of the call identifier is 4 octets. 
    
   The value of the call identifier is assigned by the originating call 
   controller. 
    
    
5.1.2 Call Capability 
    
   This  document  does  not  cover  extensions  to  support  the  call 
   capability. Such support  may be provided in a  separate  draft. This 
   document  only  provides  extensions  to  support  logical  call  and 
   connection separation. 
    
    
5.2 What Does Current GMPLS Provide 
    
   The signaling mechanism defined in [RFC2961], [RFC3209] and [GMPLS-
   SIG] supports automatic connection management; however it does not 
   provide capability to support the call model. A call may be viewed as 
   a special purpose connection that requires a different subset of 
   information to be carried by the messages. This information is 

  
Lin            draft-lin-ccamp-gmpls-ason-rsvpte-00.txt              6 

                        GMPLS RSVP-TE for ASON               June 2002 
 
 
   targeted to the call controller for the purpose of setting up a 
   call/connection association.  
    
    
5.3 Support for Basic Call and Connection 
    
   To support basic call capability, a call identifier is introduced to 
   various message sets. This basic call capability helps introduce the 
   call model; however, additional extensions may be needed to fully 
   support the canonical call model. For example, in a global network, 
   supporting a call model requires agreements on global naming and 
   addressing structure used for call endpoints, as well as various call 
   capability sets. Within the context of this document, every call 
   (during steady state) may have one (or more) associated connections. 
   A zero connection call is defined as a transient state, e.g., during 
   a break-before-make restoration event. 
    
   In the scope of ASON, to support a logical call and connection 
   separation, a new call identifier is needed as described above. The 
   new CALL_ID object is carried by the Path, Resv, PathTear, PathErr, 
   and Notify message. The new CALL_ID object (along with other objects 
   associated with a call, e.g., GENERALIZED_UNI) is processed by the 
   call controller, while other objects included in these messages are 
   processed by the connection controller as described in [GMPLS-
   RSVPTE]. Processing of the CALL_ID (and related) object is described 
   in this document. 
    
   Note: unmodified message formats are not listed.

6. Support For Behaviors during Control Plane Failures 
    
   Various types of (combinations of) failures may occur within an 
   automatically switched optical network. These failures may impact the 
   control plane as well as the data plane. As described in [GMPLS-RSVP-
   TE], current GMPLS restart mechanisms allows support to handle all of 
   these different scenarios, and thus no additional extensions are 
   required. However, in the scope of the ASON model, several optional 
   procedures may take place in order to support the behaviors (as per 
   [G7713] and [IPO-RQTS]) within the control plane. 
    
   -    A control plane node should provide capability for persistent 
        storage of call and connection state information. This 
        capability allows each control plane node to recover the states 
        of calls/connections after recovery from a signaling controller 
        entity failure/reboot (or loss of local FSM state in memory). 
        Note that although the restart mechanism allows neighbor control 
        plane nodes to automatically recover (and thus infer) the states 
        of calls/connections, this mechanism can be used for 
        verification of neighbor states while the persistent storage 
        provides the local recovery of lost state. In this case, per 
        [GMPLS-RSVP-TE], if during the Hello synchronization the 
        restarting node determines that a neighbor does not support 
        state recovery, and the restarting node maintains its state on a 
        per neighbor basis, the restarting node should immediately 
        consider the Recovery as completed 
   -    A control plane node detecting a signaling channel failure 
        should request the management system for further instructions 
        during signaling channel failure, with a default control plane 
        behavior to enter self-refresh (i.e. preservation) of the 
        call/connection states. As an example, possible management 
        system instructions may be to remain in self-refresh mode, or to 
        release RSVP states of certain connections 
   -    A control plane node detecting that one (or more) connections 
        cannot be re-synchronized with its neighbor (e.g., due to 
        different states for the call/connection) should request the 
        management system for further instructions on how to handle the 
        non-synchronized connection. As an example, possible management 
        system instructions may be to keep the current RSVP state for 
        the connection. Specifics of the interactions between the 
        control plane and management plane are beyond the scope of this 
        document 
   -    A control plane node (after recovering from node failure) may 
        lose information on forwarding adjacency. In this case the 
        control plane node should request an external controller (e.g., 
        the management system) for information to recover the forwarding

        adjacency information. Specifics of the interactions between the 
        control plane and management plane are beyond the scope of this 
        document 
    
    
7. Support For Label Usage 
    
   Labels are defined in GMPLS to provide information on the resources 
   used for a particular connection. The labels may range from 
   specifying a particular timeslot to a particular wavelength. In the 
   context of the automatic switched optical network, the value of a 
   label may not be consistently the same across a link. For example, 
   the figure below illustrates the case where two GMPLS/ASON-enabled 
   nodes (A and Z) are interconnected across two non-GMPLS/ASON-enabled 
   nodes (B and C), where these nodes are all SDH/SONET nodes providing, 
   e.g., a VC-4 service. 
    
   +-----+                   +-----+ 
   |     |   +---+   +---+   |     | 
   |  A  |---| B |---| C |---|  Z  | 
   |     |   +---+   +---+   |     | 
   +-----+                   +-----+ 
    
   Labels have an associated structure imposed on them for local use 
   based on [GMPLS-SDHSONET] and [GMPLS-OTN]. Once the local label is 
   transmitted across an interface to its neighboring control plane 
   node, the structure of the local label may be not significant to the 
   neighbor node since the value used for the local label and the remote 
   label may not necessarily be the same. This issue does not present a 
   problem in a simple point-to-point connections between two control 
   plane-enabled nodes where the timeslots are mapped 1:1 across the 
   interface. However, in the scope of the ASON, once a non-GMPLS 
   capable sub-network is introduced between these nodes (as in the 
   above figure, where the sub-network provides re-arrangement 
   capability for the timeslots) label scoping becomes an issue.  
    
   There is an implicit assumption that the non-control-plane 
   connections already exist prior to any connection request and that, 
   e.g., node A's outgoing VC-4's timeslot #1 (with SUKLM 
   label=[1,0,0,0,0]) as defined in [GMPLS-SONETSDH]) may be mapped onto 
   node B's outgoing VC-4's timeslot #6 (label=[6,0,0,0,0]) may be 
   mapped onto node C's outgoing VC-4's timeslot #4 (label=[4,0,0,0,0]). 
   Thus by the time node Z receives the request from node A with 
   label=[1,0,0,0,0], the node Z's local label and the timeslot no 
   longer corresponds to the received label and timeslot information.

   As such to support the general network case, the scope of the label 
   value is considered local to a control plane node. A label 
   association function can be used by the control plane node receiving 
   a request to map the received (remote) label into a locally 
   significant label. The information necessary to allow mapping from 
   received label value to a locally significant label value may be 
   derived in several ways: 
    
   -    Via manual provisioning of the association 
   -    Via discovery of the association 
    
   Either method may be used. In the case of dynamic association, this 
   implies that the discovery mechanism operates at the timeslot/label 
   level. Note that in the simple case where two nodes are directly 
   connected, no association may be necessary. In such instances, the 
   label association function provides a one-to-one mapping of the 
   received to local label values. 
    
    
8. Security Considerations 
    
   This draft introduces no new security considerations. 
    
    
9. IANA Considerations 
    
   There are multiple fields and values defined within this document. 
   IANA is requested to administer assignment of these new values.  All 
   values should be allocated through an IETF Consensus action. This 
   document makes suggestions on the assignments given below. 
    
    
9.1 Assignment of New Messages 
    
   No new messages are defined to support the functions discussed in 
   this document. 
    
    
9.2 Assignment of New Objects 
    
   Three new objects are defined: 
    
   -    CALL_ID; this object should be assigned an object identifier of 
        the form 11bbbbbb. A suggested value is 227 [TBA].

   -    CALL_OPS; this object should be assigned an object identifier of 
        the form 11bbbbbb. A suggested value is 228 [TBA].  
    
   -    GENERALIZED_UNI; this object is defined in [OIF-UNI1] with a 
        class-num of the form 11bbbbbb. A suggested value is 229 [TBA]. 
    
    
9.3 Assignment of New Sub-Objects (and Sub-types) 
    
   One new sub-object is defined under the GENERALIZED_UNI object: 
    
   -    SPC_LABEL; this sub-object is part of the GENERALIZED_UNI 
        object, as a sub-type of the EGRESS_LABEL sub-object. A 
        suggested value is sub-type=2 [TBA]. 
    
    
9.4 Assignment of New Error Code/Values 
    
   No new error codes are required. The following new error values are 
   defined, with the suggested values. Note that certain values were 
   defined with the suggested values in [OIF-UNI1] and are included here 
   for completeness. For error values that have already been assigned by 
   IANA, then those assigned values take precedence over the suggested 
   values below; otherwise the values below are suggested to be used for 
   the error types as described. 
    
   02/100 [TBA]: unauthorized source 
   02/101 [TBA]: unauthorized destination 
    
   24/100 [TBA]: diversity not available 
   24/101 [TBA]: service level not available 
   24/102 [TBA]: invalid/unknown connection ID 
   24/103 [TBA]: no route available toward source 
   24/104 [TBA]: unacceptable interface ID 
   24/105 [TBA]: invalid/unknown call ID 
   24/106 [TBA]: invalid SPC interface ID/label

Appendix I. Non-Normative Extensions for Supporting Complete Separation 
of Call and Connection 
    
   This section describes the optional capability to support complete 
   separation of call and connection. To support complete separation of 
   call and connection, a call capability object is introduced. 
    
    
I.1 Call Capability 
    
   A call capability is used to specify the capabilities supported for a 
   call. For RSVP-TE a new CALL_OPS object is defined to be carried by 
   the Path, Resv, PathTear, PathErr, and Notify message. The CALL_OPS 
   object also serves to differentiate the messages to indicate a "call-
   only" call. In the case for logical separation of call and 
   connection, the CALL_OPS object is not needed. 
    
   The CALL_OPS object is defined as follows (the Class-num is the 
   suggested value for the new object): 
    
   CALL_OPS (Class-num = 228 [TBA], C-type = 1) 
    
   0                   1                   2                   3 
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |            Length             |Class-Num (228)|  C-Type (1)   | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |                Reserved                       | Call ops flag | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
   Two flags are currently defined for the "call ops flag": 
        0x01: call without connection 
        0x02: synchronizing a call (for restart mechanism) 
    
    
I.2 Complete Separation of Call and Connection (RSVP-TE Extensions) 
    
   A complete separation of call and connection implies that a call 
   (during steady state) may have zero (or more) associated connections. 
   A zero connection call is a steady state, e.g., simply setting up the 
   user end-point relationship prior to connection setup.
