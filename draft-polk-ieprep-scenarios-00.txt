1.0	Introduction

This memo attempts, without going into too much complexity, to articulate 
the likely topological scenarios which should be encountered, thus focused 
on by this working group when writing requirements, gap analysis and other 
documents.

There has been much confusion on the IEPREP list as well as within each 
meeting (including the interim) as to the topologies IEPREP is referring 
to. Hopefully this document will give each reader a reference to which 
they can point to and say (with conviction) in scenario A, x happens, or y 
is broken; instead of consistently having list and session contributors 
have to describe the topology to which they are referring to as well as 
their point to be made.

This memo attempts to be agnostic with regard to IP signaling or control 
protocols (SIP, MEGACO, etc).


1.2 Motivation

Simply put, to get everyone referencing the same (named) topologies in 
order to have useful and less confusing dialog to further this WG's 
efforts.


2.0 Overview of IEPREP

IEPREP is an international mechanism for signaling preferential treatments 
of communications used by only a select few of our population. These are 
authorized individuals trained in the usage of Emergency Preparedness

Methods and Mechanisms. [1] details the framework of the IEPREP effort, 
and several requirements IDs can be found at the IEPREP WG homepage at: 
http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/ieprep-charter.html. Further information 
regarding the WG efforts should be researched there and the list archives.


3.0 IEPREP Topologies

There are 4 often mentioned, but very little documented topologies 
discussed within this WG's work so far. The following subsections will go 
through each of the 4 that were first articulated by Scott Bradner in an 
analysis he did as a result of a side conversation regarding the SIP 
Resource Priority Header ID [2] and its usefulness within the IEPREP 
charter.

The 4 topologies are (quickly):

     Topology A û IP in the Middle

     Topology B û IP at the Start

     Topology C û IP at the End

     Topology D û IP End-to-End

Within each topology listed above, and detail in the following sections, 
is the question of "where is the authentication/authorization occurring"? 
This should add another dimension to Topologies B and C (making a total of 
six topologies, but with this first version of this document, explanation 
of it is left to within the explanation section for B and C respectively. 
As far as topologies A and D, with regard to where authentication/ 
authorization occurs, it's most likely in the topology A that 
authentication/authorization will occur in the Circuit Switched Network 
(CSN) on either side the IP core, therefore auth/auth in the IP section of 
the network will not (yet) be discussed further. For topology D, auth/auth 
can only occur within the IP network.

The following sections detail each of the 4 topologies.


3.1 Topology A û IP in the Middle

Otherwise known as IP Bridging two CSNs. In this topology, a CSN phone of 
any type makes a call to another CSN phone with an IP core between the two 
CSNs. This topology should behave as the GETS (in the US) or GTPS (in the 
UK) service behaves today, any IP section in the call path should be for 
transport only, though should convey the appropriate signaling for IEPREP 
or ETS behaviors within the packets (defined elsewhere). User 
authentication and authorization should occur within the CSN as it occurs 
in today's CSN only network. This topology should simplistically look like 
this:

              Figure 1. Topology A û IP in the Middle


3.2 Topology B û IP at the Start

This topology has the calling party placing the call from an IP Phone, and 
the called party being in the CSN (somewhere).

                              |       +----+    |                         
              IP              |       |    |    |     CSN                 
             Phone -------------------| GW |-------- Phone                
                              |       |    |    |                         
                              |       +----+    |                         
          +-------------------+                 +---------------          
                                                                          
              Figure 2. Topology B û IP at the Start


The added dimension is the question of where the authentication/ 
authorization is done for the IEPREP or ETS service. If it is done within 
the CSN, it can only be performed by the caller in a form that the CSN 
understands: digits on the keypad of the phone, or speaker recognition 
(which isn't currently used in the CSN, but could be). If the caller is 
authorized to perform some form of preferential treatment with that call, 
the CSN needs a mechanism to convey that authorization back to the 
caller's device in such a way that the IP network will understand.

3.3 Topology C û IP at the End

This topology has the calling party placing the call from an CSN phone 
(somewhere), and the called party being in an IP network. 

                                                                          
             Circuit                               Internet               
             Switched                                 or                  
             Network                              IP Segment              
          +-------------------+                 +---------------          
                              |       +----+    |                         
              CSN             |       |    |    |     IP                  
             Phone -------------------| GW |-------- Phone                
                              |       |    |    |                         
                              |       +----+    |                         
          +-------------------+                 +---------------          
                                                                          
              Figure 3. Topology C û IP at the End


Authentication/Authorization in topology C should occur within the CSN on 
the originating side of the call path. In time, there might be situations 
where the CSN is only a transport into the IP network of an IEPREP call, 
therefore similar attributes to topology B should occur within C; where 
the IP authentication/authorization mechanism must be conveyed to the CSN 
Gateway (and on to the calling user) in such a way as to identify that 
call on an e2e basis to behave according to the goals set forth by the 
IEPREP WG for that call.


3.4 Topology D û IP End-to-End

This topology has no circuit switched sections in the call path. 
Therefore, authentication/authorization must occur in IP, and in such a 
way to provide the end station enough information (tokens, strings, etc) 
to convey an IEPREP desired behavior for that call throughout the IP 
network.

This document does not suggest anything other than a common naming 
convention within IEPREP WG discussions, therefore there should be no 
special security considerations

There are no IANA considerations within this document
