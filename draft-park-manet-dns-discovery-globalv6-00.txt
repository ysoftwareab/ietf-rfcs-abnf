  1. Introduction 
      
     The global connectivity in IPv6 mobile ad hoc networks is 
     often required for manet nodes desiring communication with the 
     fixed Internet [GLOBALv6].  For global connectivity, manet 
     nodes have unique global address which is used for 
     communication to the Internet.  This address is typically 
     resolved from a DNS name.  DNS resolution is a vital service 
     for a host connected to an IPv6 network. 
      
     This document describes the process of DNS Discovery based on 
     IPv6 Router Advertisement (RA) to find out the address of DNS 
     server in IPv6 Mobile Ad hoc Networks and defines new manet 
     DNS resolver option in modified manet Router Advertisement 
     [GLOBALv6].  The Manet DNS reslover option will allow any 
     manet nodes to discover IPv6 addresses of DNS resolvers (with 
     preference to global-unicast addresses).  The purpose is also 
     to enhance the efficiency of global connectivity [GLOBALv6] 
     when internet-gateway do not provide proxy DNS function.

     o DNS Discovery         The process of manet nodes to find out  
                             the address of DNS server, typically

                             recursive DNS server addresses in the  
                             Internet.  The addresses are used for  
                             manet nodes to obtain global addresses  
                             from a DNS name. 
      
     o Manet DNS resolver (MDNSR) option 
                             The Manet DNS resolver option contains  
                             the DNS server addresses in modified  
                             manet Router Advertisement message. 
      
     o internet-gateway      A router which provides Internet  
                             connectivity for nodes in the manet.   
                             This router is located at the edge of  
                             manet and has a connection to both the  
                             Internet and the manet. (is described  
                             in [GLOBALv6]. 
      
      
  2. Overview 
      
     Likewise generally IPv6 networks, an internet-gateway sends 
     out a manet Router Advertisement message either periodically 
     or response to a manet Router Solicitation.  Moreover, the 
     internet-gateway allows to send unsolicited manet Router 
     Advertisements, although sending them periodically would 
     generate unnecessary packets in manet.  After manet nodes 
     obtain global address, DNS queries, web browsing and that kind 
     of services can be used in manet.  The MDNSR option provides a 
     standard mechanism for advertising DNS resolver IPv6 addresses 
     with current manet Router Advertisement in manet. 
      
      
  3. Manet DNS resolver option 
      
     The MDNSR option contains the IPv6 address of DNS server.  
     When advertising more than one MDNSR option, as many MDNSR 
     options as DNS servers are included in an manet Router 
     Advertisement message.

     Fields: 
      
        o Type      11 
      
        o Length    8-bit unsigned integer.  The length of option  
                    (including the type and length fields).  The  
                    value 0 is invalid.  Nodes MUST silently  
                    discard a manet Router Advertisement message  
                    that contains an option with length zero. 
      
        o Pref      The preference of a DNS server.  A 4 bit  
                    unsigned integer.  A decimal value of 15  
                    indicates the highest preference.  A decimal  
                    value of 0 indicates that the DNS server can  
                    not be used.  The field can be used for load  
                    balancing of DNS queries with multiple 
                    recursive DNS servers according to local policy. 
      
        o IPv6 Address of DNS Server 
                    Recursive DNS Server's address for DNS name 
                    resolution. 
      
     MDNSR option MUST be silently ignored for other Neighbor 
     Discovery messages. 
      
      
  4. Open Issues 
      
     The internet-gateway can be a proxy DNS in some case, then 
     each manet nodes do not need to request address resolution 
     packets to DNS server, but only to internet-gateway.  It is up 
     to network administrator.

  5. Security Considerations 
      
     This security is essentially related to Neighbor Discovery 
     Protocol security [DISCOVERY] and the security section in 
     [GLOBALv6].  Security issues regarding the Neighbor Discovery 
     Protocol are being discussed in SEND (Secure Neighbor 
     Discovery) Working Group in IETF.
