Internet Draft   Management Information Base for SNMPv2   September 1995


1.  Introduction

A management system contains: several (potentially many) nodes, each
with a processing entity, termed an agent, which has access to
management instrumentation; at least one management station; and, a
management protocol, used to convey management information between the
agents and management stations.  Operations of the protocol are carried
out under an administrative framework which defines authentication,
authorization, access control, and privacy policies.

Management stations execute management applications which monitor and
control managed elements.  Managed elements are devices such as hosts,
routers, terminal servers, etc., which are monitored and controlled via
access to their management information.

Management information is viewed as a collection of managed objects,
residing in a virtual information store, termed the Management
Information Base (MIB).  Collections of related objects are defined in
MIB modules.  These modules are written using a subset of OSI's Abstract
Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [1], termed the Structure of Management
Information (SMI) [2].

The management protocol, SNMPv2 [3], provides for the exchange of
messages which convey management information between the agents and the
management stations.  It is the purpose of this document to define
managed objects which describe the behavior of a SNMPv2 entity.


1.1.  A Note on Terminology

For the purpose of exposition, the original Internet-standard Network
Management Framework, as described in RFCs 1155, 1157, and 1212, is
termed the SNMP version 1 framework (SNMPv1).  The current framework is
termed the SNMP version 2 framework (SNMPv2).

            in the range 1 through 7, that this node performs
            transactions for, 2 raised to (L - 1) is added to the sum.
            For example, a node which performs only routing functions
            would have a value of 4 (2^(3-1)).  In contrast, a node
            which is a host offering application services would have a
            value of 72 (2^(4-1) + 2^(7-1)).  Note that in the context
            of the Internet suite of protocols, values should be
            calculated accordingly:
