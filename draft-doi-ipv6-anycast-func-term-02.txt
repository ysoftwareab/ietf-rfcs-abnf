Abstract

   Anycast is very useful, and many researches about it are made.  This
   document defines anycast related terms to use a term in common on the
   researches about anycast.  In this document, we focus on network-
   layer anycast, which is defined in IPv6 specification [ADDR-ARCH].

Internet-Draft     IPv6 Anycast Terminology Definition   October 7, 2004


1. Introduction

   In IPv6 networks, a service-oriented address can be assigned to a
   interface.  This address is called anycast address which identifies a
   set of interfaces.  A packet sent to an anycast address is delivered
   to one of the interfaces identified by that address.  The interface
   is nearest one according to the routing protocols' measure of
   distance.  The purpose of this document is to clear usage of terms
   for IPv6 anycast and to support documents about IPv6 anycast.

2.  Definition Format

   Definitions in this document go along with following format.

     Term to be defined.

     Definition:
       The specific definition for the term.

     Discussion:
       A brief discussion of the term, its application, or other
       information that would build understanding.

     [See Also:]
       List of other terms that are relevant to the discussion of this
       term.  This field is optional in this document.

3. Term Definitions

3.1 Basic Terms

   We first define some basic terms. These definitions will assist in
   describing the following terminology definitions.

  o  Anycast Address (AA)

    Definition:
      An address to be used for anycast communication.  Already defined
      in [ANYCASTING].

    Discussion:
      This address is service-oriented address assigned to some
      interfaces.  The interfaces to which the same anycast address
      is assigned provide same service.

  o  Anycast Packet (AP)

    Definition:

Internet-Draft     IPv6 Anycast Terminology Definition   October 7, 2004


      A packet whose destination address field is filled with an anycast
      address.

    Discussion:
      Anycast Packet is used for Anycast Comunication.  When there are
      plural Anycast Receivers, one of the Anycast Receivers is chosen
      and receive an Anycast Packet.

  o  Anycast Initiator (AI)

    Definition:
      A node that sends an anycast packet and initiates an anycast
      communication.

    Discussion:
      Any node can become Anycast Initiator.  A node who want a
      particular service send an Anycast Packet and become Anycast
      Initiator.
      We use the term not "Sender" but "Initiator", because an Anycast
      Communication is not continuously and only first one round trip
      makes sense.

    See Also:
      - Anycast Communication
      - Anycast Responder(s)
      - Coresponding Anycast Responder

  o  Anycast Responder(s) (AR)
    Definition:
      A node who can respond to a anycast packet.

    Discussion:
      Anycast Responder has an interface which is assigned an Anycast
      Address.  One of the Anycast Responders receives an Anycast Packet
      which an Anycast Initiator sends.

    See Also:
      - Anycast Initiator
      - Coresponding Anycast Responder

  o  Coresponding Anycast Responder (CAR)
    Definition:
      A node which actually receives an anycast packet issued from
      anycast initiator.

    Discussion:
      When an Anycast Initiator sends an Anycast Packet, one of the
      nodes in Anycast Membership is selected by Anycast Member Node

      Selection Criteria.  The selected node is called Coresponding
      Anycast Responder.
      Even if we use the same Anycast Member Node Selection Criteria,
      Coresponding Anycast Responder can vary node according to a
      differences of Anycast Initiator and network condition.

3.2 Communication Terms

  o  Anycast Communication

    Definition:
      A communication initiated by Anycast Initiator using an Anycast
      Packet.

    Discussion:

      Initiator to Corresponding Anycast Responder.

Internet-Draft     IPv6 Anycast Terminology Definition   October 7, 2004


    Discussion:
      We consider anycast as a service discovery mechanism [AARP].  Once
      an anycast receiver is discovered, the anycast initiator uses the
      server's unicast address for continuous communication.

3.5 Addressing Terms

  o  Anycast Address Prefix (AAP)

    Definition:
      Prefix part of a anycast address.

    Discussion:
      Anycast addresses belong to the unicast address spaces
      [ADDR-ARCH], but, unlike unicast, assignment of anycast addresses
      is not determined by the node location.  Henceforth, we need to
      consider what kind of addresses should be assigned to the anycast
      address.  First, we categorize into two types of anycast address.
      The assignment of anycast address depends on whether all anycast
      receivers are on the same segment or on different segments.  It is
      also true for the anycast address assignment policy.  If all
      anycast receivers are connected to the same segment, the anycast
      address can be assigned with its segment's prefix.  On the other
      hand, if anycast receivers are on different segments, the anycast
      address are determined arbitrarily.

      - Global Anycast

  o  Local Anycast (LA)

    Definition:

Internet-Draft     IPv6 Anycast Terminology Definition   October 7, 2004


      An anycast in case there are anycast member nodes only in a same
      subnet.

    Discussion:
      An anycast address here is determined based on the anycast member
      node's unicast address prefix.  Its interface-ID is determined
      arbitrarily.  All anycast member nodes that share the same anycast
      address are connected to the same segment.
      In unicast routing, routers forward packets by prefix routing.
      Therefore, in case of local anycast, anycast packets can reach the
      last hop router by unicast routing. When the last hop router
      receives the anycast packets, anycast responder is determined by
      the Neighbor Cache [ND] of the last hop router.

      nodes that share the same anycast address may not be connected to

    Discussion:
      Anycast address prefix of a non-sprouted anycast address may not
      indicate existing segment in the actual network.  Without anycast
      routing, the packet towards this address might not reach anywhere.
