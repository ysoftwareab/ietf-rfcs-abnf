1.  Introduction

   This document describes a Management Information Base for managing
   "emulated" ATM services over a Packet Switched Network(PSN).  This
   document follows the Requirements for Pseudo-Wire Emulation Edge-to-
   Edge [PWREQ] document, The MIB objects closely work with the MIBs
   described in [PWMIB] and the textual conventions defined in [PWTC].
   The MIB objects are defined in a way that is not specific to the PSN
   that is emulating this service.


2.   Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [BCP14].


3.  Terminology


   This document follows the terminology used in PW Architecture
   [PWARCH].


   Outbound            References the traffic direction where a ATM Cell
                       is received, adapted to packet, assigned a PW
                       label, and sent into the PSN.

   Inbound             The direction where packets are received
                       from the PSN, cells are reconstructed from the
                       packet payloads, and sent into the ATM Network
                       as cells.

   Adaptation          Refers to the method of adapting a "foreign"
                       communications protocol such that it can be
                       carried by a packet switched net (the PSN). For
                       example, in a ATM service the foreign protocol
                       is ATM. The PSN may be MPLS.

   PSN                 Packet Switched Network.

   PSN Tunnel          A general term indicating a virtual connection
                       between the two PW edge devices. In practice
                       this connection is not limited to path-oriented
                       types of PSNs such as MPLS. An example of a non-
                       path-oriented PSN is an IP PSN.

4.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


5.  Object Definitions

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The object
   type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a
   specific instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we
   often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to also refer to
   the object type.


6.  Feature Checklist

   This MIB is designed to satisfy the following requirements and
   constraints:
   o  - Fit within the architecture defined [PWMIB].
   o  - Fit within the model for VP/VC definitions and management
      concept as defined in the [AToM] MIB.
   o  - MIB supports manually configured ATM PWs
   o  - MIB supports automatically configured ATM PWs
   o  - The MIB enables the use of any PSN
   o  - The MIB supports point-to-point ATM PW connections.  Point-to-
      multipoint and multipoint-to-point connections are for future
      study.
   o  - The MIB allows configuration of all the parameters needed to
      establish a PW to carry ATM cells.
   o  - The MIB reports: ATM performance metrics for the ATM PW.  This
      includes cells transmit, Cells dropped, Cells received, and
      unknownCells.  In addition it reports performance metrics at
      packet level.

   o  - ATM OAM cell support.
   o  - The MIB does not consider ILMI support


7.  PW-MIB usage

   The MIB structure for defining a PW service is composed of three
   layers of MIB modules functioning together.  This general model is
   defined in the PWE3 Architecture [PWARCH].  The layering model is
   intended to sufficiently isolate PW services from the underlying PSN
   layer that carries the emulated service.  This is done at the same
   time as providing a standard means for connecting any supported
   services to any supported PSNs.

   The first layer known as the service layer contains service-specific
   modules such as the one defined in this document.  These modules
   define service-specific management objects that interface or
   collaborate with existing MIB modules for the native version of the
   service.  The service-specific module "glues" the standard module to
   the PWE MIB framework.

   The next layer of the PWE MIB framework is comprised of the PW-MIB
   module [PWMIB].  This module is used to configure general parameters
   of PW connections that are common to all types of emulated services
   and PSNs.  This layer is connected to the service-specific layer
   above, and the PSN layer below.

   The PSN layer provides PSN-specific modules for each type of PSN.
   These modules associate the PW with one or more "tunnels" that carry
   the service over the PSN.  These modules are defined in other
   documents.  This module is used to "glue" the PW service to the
   underlying PSN-specific MIB modules.  In the case of MPLS, for
   example, the PW-MPLS MIB [PWMPLSMIB] is used to connect the PW
   service to either the MPLS-LDP [LDPMIB] or MPLS-TE [TEMIB] MIBs.

   [PWTC] defines some of the object types used in these modules.


8.  ATM-PW MIB Usage

   This section provides an example of using the MIB objects described
   in section 8 to set up an ATM PW.  While this example is not meant to
   illustrate every permutation of the MIB, it is intended as an aid in
   the understanding of some key concepts.  It is meant to be read after
   going through the MIB itself.  See [PWMIB] for an example of setting
   up a PSN Tunnel.

   The following example illustrates how a user will set up an AAL5 ATM

   PW on a switch/router with cells entering the switch/router through
   ATM Interface with IfIndex 1000, VPI 1 and VCI 100 (from ATM Network
   to PSN - outbound direction) and on the way back, it goes out of the
   switch/router through ATM Interface 1000 with VPI 1 and VCI 100 (PSN
   to ATM Network - inbound direction)

   First create an entry in PW MIB with pwType atmAal5SduVcc(2), then
   create entries in pwAtmCfg table, inbound and outbound tables.


       In PW ATM MIB
       In pwAtmCfgTable:

       pwAtmCfgMaxCellConcatenation 29
       pwAtmCfgTimeoutMode enabled(3)
       pwAtmClpQosMapping false(0) --CLP will not be mapped to QoS
       pwAtmOamCellSupported true(1)  --OAM cells will be supported


       In pwAtmOutboundTable:
       {
        pwAtmOutboundAtmIf             1000    --Outbound AtmIf
        pwAtmOutboundVpi               1       --Outbound VPI
        pwAtmOutboundVci               100     --Outbound VCI
        pwAtmOutboundTrafficParamDescr 0.0     --Best Effort
        pwAtmOutboundRowStatus         createAndGo
       }


       In pwAtmInboundTable
       {
        pwAtmInboundAtmIf             1000 --Inbound AtmIf
        pwAtmInboundVpi               1    --Inbound VPI
        pwAtmInboundVci               100  --Inbound VCI
        pwAtmInboundTrafficParamDescr 0.0  --Best Effort
        pwAtmInboundRowStatus         createAndGo

       }


9.  ATM-PW MIB Summary

   This MIB consists of 4 types of tables;
      It is important to note that the TrafficParamDescr Table is not
      defined as part of this MIB although an object pointing to such
      table entry exist in all configurati tables of this MIB module.
      Users can refer to any ATM TrafficDescr (TD) Table if there is a
      need to overwrite the TD assigned to the ATM endpoint in the ATM

      service MIB [AToM].
      - PW ATM Cfg Table A table for generic parameters for ATM PW
      configuration that is applicable for each ATM PW.
      - PW ATM Outbound Table There are 2 tables to configure an
      outbound ATM PW depending on the type of service.  One table for
      1: 1 service, and the other for N:1 service.
      - PW ATM Inbound Table There are 2 tables to configure an inbound
      ATM PW depending on the type of service.  One table for 1: 1
      service, and the other for N:1 service.
      - PW ATM Perf Table There are 3 tables each contains the relevant
      time dependent statistics for an ATM PW Entry.  There is a current
      table, 15 minutes interval table and one day interval table.  The
      tables are aligned with statistic model of other PW services.

11.  Security considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such



Sathappan, et al.        Expires April 12, 2007                [Page 36]

Internet-Draft             Manage ATM over PSN              October 2006


   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   The pwAtmOutboundTable, pwAtmInboundTable, pwAtmCfgTable,
   pwAtmOutboundNto1Table, and pwAtmInboundNto1Table contain objects of
   ATM PW parameters on a Provider Edge (PE) device.  Unauthorized
   access to objects in these tables could result in disruption of
   traffic on the network.

   The use of stronger mechanisms such as SNMPv3 security should be
   considered where possible.  Specifically, SNMPv3 VACM and USM MUST be
   used with any SNMPV3 agent, which implements this MIB module.
   Administrators should consider whether read access to these objects
   should be allowed, since read access may be undesirable under certain
   circumstances.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module "i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible" may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   The pwTDMTable, pwAtmPerfCurrentTable, pwAtmPerfIntervalTable and
   pwAtmPerf1DayIntervalTable collectively show the ATM pseudo wire
   connectivity topology and its performance characteristics.

   If an Administrator does not want to reveal this information, then
   these tables should be considered sensitive/vulnerable.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure "for example by using IPSec",
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET "read/change/create/delete" the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework "see [RFC3410], section 8",
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms "for
   authentication and privacy".

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator

   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module, is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals "users" that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET "change/create/delete" them.


12.  IANA considerations

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

   Descriptor OBJECT IDENTIFIER value

   ---------- -----------------------

   pwATMMIB { transmission XXX }

   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
   requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'transmission'
   subtree and to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.
   When the assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace
   "XXX" (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to
   remove this note.
