              SDCP: Streaming Distributed Control Protocol
                      draft-appsawg-perez-sdcp-00

Abstract

   This memorandum describes SDCP, a protocol to control multimedia
   streaming in cases where streaming generation should be distributed
   to improve performance.  This is especially useful for Human-Things
   streams.  Usually, real time applications such as virtual reality
   generate a user-controlled multimedia streaming.  This is a time
   continuous data flux that could be divided spatially to distribute
   processing, memory or network resources.  This protocol does not
   describe streaming communication, but the control of each single
   streaming generation in a best-effort by many nodes or things.

1.  Introduction

   Usually, the amount of information transmitted from human to computer
   is very small.  Such is the case of information generated by input
   devices, for example, keyboards, mouses or touch screens.  On the
   contrary, the amount of information transmitted from computer to
   human is big.  This is increasing over time.  Such is the case of
   information generated by output devices, for example, computer
   monitors or cellphone screens.  Furthermore, the hardware resources
   such as data processing, network bandwidth or storage are too big.
   In many applications, human-to-computer control data is required to
   generate computer-to-human data, such as virtual reality.  In this
   way, human-to-computer control data may be sending to many nodes in
   multicast method by best-effort delivery and processing.

Internet-Draft                    SDCP                        March 2016


   Streaming Distributed Control Protocol (SDCP) is an application-level
   protocol for control of streaming distributed generation.  SDCP is
   built on the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) [RFC0768], which provides a
   connection less transport mechanism.  SDCP provides the complete
   information for proper streaming generation.  Other mechanism have
   been specified to transmit multimedia streaming, including the Real
   Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) [RFC2326].  The SDCP is not meant to
   displace this mechanism but rather complement it.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.  Terminology

   Some clarifications and additional definitions follow:

   o  Multimedia Streaming: It is a group of successive multimedia real-
      time data blocks in the time.  A real-time data block can be an
      audio level for multimedia audio streaming or a frame for
      multimedia video streaming.  Successive blocks of multimedia
      streaming must be ordered in time.

   o  Data Block (DB): Data portion of stream with the same shared time
      slot.

   o  Spatial Data Segment (SDS): Spatial Data segment is subdivision or
      partition of each Data block to distributed generation.  These
      fragments can be spatial fragment of render image or audio wave
      channel.

   o  Processor nodes: These nodes generate the multimedia streaming
      under a distributed scheme.

   o  Administrator Node: This node controls multimedia streaming
      generation by periodically sending streaming control to the
      processor nodes.

   o  Integrator node: This node receives multimedia streaming from
      Processor nodes to display this to a human receptor.

   Integrator and Administrator nodes are the human-side and Processor
   nodes are the things-side of the communication system.

                                 Figure 1

   Administrator Node sends periodically SDCP multicast control
   datagrams to Processor Nodes.  The use of multicast is mandatory to
   select processor group id.  The amount of SDCP datagrams should be
   sufficient to compensate losses and to allow real-time operation.
   These losses may occur by delivery problems or ignored by processor
   nodes.  Administrator Node MAY assign different Processor Node for
   processing each SDS.

   Each unoccupied Processor Node receive SDCP datagrams.  Occupied
   Processor Node SHOULD ignore SDCP datagrams.  Each Processor Node
   generates stream portion through the use of more current SDCP control
   data.  This generated stream is sent to appropriate Integrator Node.

   Integrator Node receives stream portion unicast communication.  All
   the stream portion received are integrated in a single stream that is
   sent to remote human receptors or locally visualized.

   Administrator Node MAY assign different destination Integrator Node
   for each SDS.  Each integrator node MAY receive multiple streams, a

   same DB or multiple/single SDS of multiple Processor Node.  However,
   each SDS is assigned to only one Integrator node.  While that
   different SDS of same stream MAY be assigned to send these to
   different integrator nodes, each SDS of same stream MUST NOT be sent
   to more than only one Integrator node.
