1. Introduction

   This document describes responses in the JSON [RFC7159] format for
   the queries as defined by the Industrial Internet Identifier Data
   Access Protocol Query Format [IDENTIFIER-QUERY]. A communication


Ma, et al.            Expires January 13, 2021                [Page 2]

Internet-Draft    Identifier Data Response Protocol      July 13, 2020


   protocol for exchanging queries and responses is described in
   [IDENTIFIER-HTTP].

1.1. Terminology and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   The following list describes terminology and definitions used
   throughout this document:

   TLN: Top-Level Nodes

   SLN: Second-Level Nodes

   ELN: Enterprise-Level Nodes

   member: data found within an object as defined by JSON [RFC7159].

   object: a data structure as defined by JSON [RFC7159].

   IIIDAP: Industrial Internet Identifier Data Access Protocol

1.2. Data Model

   The data model for JSON responses is specified in five sections:

   1. simple data types conveyed in JSON strings

   2. data structures specified as JSON arrays or objects that are used
      repeatedly when building up larger objects

   3. arrays of objects representing structured data corresponding to a
      search for multiple objects

   4. the response to an error

   Positive responses take two forms. A response to a lookup of a
   single object yields a JSON object, which is the subject of the
   lookup. A response to a search for multiple objects yields a JSON
   object that contains an array of JSON objects that are the subject
   of the search. In each type of response, other data structures are
   present within the topmost JSON object.

2. Use of JSON

2.1. Naming

   Clients of these JSON responses SHOULD ignore unrecognized JSON
   members in responses.

   Clients processing JSON responses need to be prepared for members
   representing identifier data specified in this document to be absent
   from a response. In other words, servers are free to not include
   JSON members containing identifier data based on their own policies.

   Finally, all JSON names specified in this document are case
   sensitive. Both servers and clients MUST transmit and process them
   using the specified character case.

3. Common Data Types

   JSON [RFC7159] defines the data types of a number, character string,
   boolean, array, object, and null. This section describes the
   semantics and/or syntax reference for common, JSON character strings
   used in this document.

   identifier:       Take Handle Protocol [RFC3651] as an example,
                    Identifier format of TLN is XX; identifier format
                    of SLD is XX.YY; identifier format of ELD is
                    XX.YY.ZZ; XX, YY, ZZ are UTF-8 [6] encoded
                    character strings, which use any characters from
                    the Unicode 2.0 standard except the ASCII character
                    '/' (0x2F).

   name:             The maximum limit of name field is 255 ASCII
                    characters.

   picture:          Pictures need to be Base64 encoded, then
                    transferred via json.

   id:               The maximum limit of id field is 32 ASCII
                    characters.

   country codes:    Where the identity of a geopolitical nation or
                    country is needed, these identities are represented
                    with the alpha-2 or two-character country code
                    designation as defined in [ISO.3166.1988].  The
                    alpha-2 representation is used because it is freely
                    available, whereas the alpha-3 and numeric-3
                    standards are not.

Internet-Draft    Identifier Data Response Protocol      July 13, 2020


   dates and times:  The syntax for values denoting dates and times is
                    defined in [RFC3339].

   URIs:             The syntax for values denoting a Uniform Resource
                    Identifier (URI) is defined by [RFC3986].

4. Common Data Structures

   This section defines common data structures used in responses.

4.1. IIIDAP Conformance

   The data structure named "iiidapConformance" is an array of strings,
   each providing a hint as to the specifications used in the
   construction of the response. This data structure appears only in
   the topmost JSON object of a response.

   An example iiidapConformance data structure:

   "iiidapConformance" :

   [

     "iiidap_level_0"

   ]



                                 Figure 1

   The string literal "iiidap_level_0" signifies conformance with this
   specification.

4.2. Links

   The "links" array is found in data structures to signify links to
   other resources on the Internet. The relationship of these links is
   defined by the IANA registry described by [RFC5988].

   The following is an example of the link structure:

       {
         "value" : "http://example.com/context_uri",
         "rel" : "self",
         "href" : "http://example.com/target_uri",
         "hreflang" : [ "en", "ch" ],

Internet-Draft    Identifier Data Response Protocol      July 13, 2020


         "title" : "title",
         "media" : "screen",
         "type" : "application/json"
       }



                              Figure 2

   The JSON name/values of "rel", "href", "hreflang", "title", "media",
   and "type" correspond to values found in Section 5 of [RFC5988]. The
   "value" JSON value is the context URI as described by [RFC5988]. The
   "href" JSON value MUST be specified. All other JSON values are
   OPTIONAL.

   This is an example of the "links" array as it might be found in an
   notice:

   "links" :
   [

       {

         "href" : "http://example.com",

         "title" : ""Terms of Use""

       }

   ]

                             Figure 3

4.3. Notices and Remarks

   The "notices" and "remarks" data structures take the same form. The
   notices structure denotes information about the service providing
   IIIDAP information and/or information about the entire response,
   whereas the remarks structure denotes information about the
   identifiers that contains it.

   Both are arrays of objects. Each object contains an optional "title"
   string representing the title of the object, an optional "type"
   string denoting a registered type of remark or notice, an array of
   strings named "description" for the purposes of conveying any
   descriptive text, and an optional "links" array as described in
   Section 4.2.

Internet-Draft    Identifier Data Response Protocol      July 13, 2020


   An example of the notices data structure:

   "notices" :
   [
     {
       "title" : "Terms of Use",
       "description" :
       [
         "Service subject to The Registry of the Moon's TOS.",
         "Copyright (c) 2020 LunarNIC"
       ],
       "links" :
       [
         {
           "value" : "http://example.net/entity/XXXX",
           "rel" : "alternate",
           "type" : "text/html",
           "href" : http://www.example.com/terms_of_use.html
         }
       ]
     }
   ]

                               Figure 4

It is the job of the clients to determine line breaks, spacing, and
display issues for sentences within the character strings of the
"description" array. Each string in the "description" array contains a
single complete division of human-readable text indicating to clients
where there are semantic breaks.

An example of the remarks data structure:

"remarks" :

[
  {
    "description" :
    [
      "She sells sea shells down by the sea shore.",
      "Originally written by Terry Sullivan."
    ]
  }
]

                              Figure 5



Ma, et al.            Expires January 13, 2021                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft    Identifier Data Response Protocol      July 13, 2020


Note that objects in the "remarks" array may also have a "links" array.

While the "title" and "description" fields are intended primarily for
human consumption, the "type" string contains a well-known value to be
registered with TLN for programmatic use.

An example of the remarks data structure:

"remarks" :
[
  {
    "type" : "information truncated due to authorization",
    "description" :
    [
      "Some identifier data may not have been given.",
      "Use proper authorization credentials to see all of it."
    ]
  }
]

                              Figure 6

4.4. Language Identifier

   This data structure consists solely of a name/value pair, where the
   name is "lang" and the value is a string containing a language
   identifier as described in [RFC5646].

   "lang" : "mn-Cyrl-MN"

5. Nodes

   An identifier appears throughout this document and is an appropriate
   response for the /identifier/XXXX query defined in "Industrial
   Internet Identifier Data Access Protocol (IIIDAP) Query Format"
   [IDENTIFIER-QUERY]. It represents the information of a SLN or ELN.
   All of these representations are expected to represent in JSON
   [RFC7159].

   The following is an example of an entity.

   {
     "iiidapConformance" :
     [
       "iiidap_level_0"
     ],
     "notices" :

         [
           "Without full authorization, content has been removed.",
           "Sorry, dude!"
         ],
         "links" :

   An identifier of a SLN or ELN can contain the following members:

   o identifier -- a unique identifier of a SLN or ELN

   o regTime -- a string representing the registration time of the
      identifier of a node

   o status -- a string representing the registration status of the
      identifier. Optional values of the status MUST be defined by the
      TLN. For example, status of nodes can be classified as: "ok" and
      "hold".

   o country -- a string containing the two-character country code of
      the network

   o node -- an object representing a SLN or ELN, each containing the
      following values:

      *  name -- a sting containing the name of a node

      *  nature -- a string representing the nature of a node. The
   nature of a node (SLN or ELN) MUST be defined by the TLN. For
   example, according to their nature, nodes can be classified as:
   "government organs", "research institutions", "social
   organizations", and "enterprises and institutions".

      *  type -- a string containing the business type of the node. The
   type of a node (SLN or ELN) MUST be defined by the TLN. For example,
   types of nodes can be classified as:
         "agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry and fishery",
         "the mining industry",
         "manufacturing",
         "electricity, heat, gas and water production and supply",
         "the construction industry",
         "wholesale and retail",
         "transportation, warehousing and postal services",
         "accommodation and catering",
         "information transmission, software and information technology
   services"
         "the financial sector",
         "the real estate industry",
         "leasing and business services",
         "scientific research and technology services",
         "water conservancy, environment and public facilities
   management",
         "residential services, repairs and other services",
         "education",
         "health and social work",
         "culture, sports and entertainment",
         "public administration, social security and social
   organization",
         and "the international organization".

      *  subType -- a string containing the business subtype of the
   node. The Subtype of a node (SLN or ELN) MUST be defined by the TLN.
   For example, types of nodes can be classified as:
        "agricultural"

         "forestry"
         "animal husbandry"
         "fisheries"
         "agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, fishing and

6. Error Response Body

   Some non-answer responses may return entity bodies with information
   that could be more descriptive.

   The basic structure of that response is an object containing an
   error code number (corresponding to the HTTP response code) followed
   by a string named "title" and an array of strings named
   "description".

   This is an example of the common response body.

   {
     "errorCode": 418,
     "title": "Your Beverage Choice is Not Available",
     "description":
     [
       "I know coffee has more ummppphhh.",
       "Sorry, dude!"
     ]
   }

                                 Figure 8

   This is an example of the common response body with an
   iiidapConformance and notices data structures:

  "iiidapConformance" :
  [
    "iiidap_level_0"
  ],
  "notices" :

        "Beverages with caffeine for keeping horses awake."
      ],
      "links" :

          "type" : "text/html",
          "href" : "http://www.example.com/redaction_policy.html"
        }

    "Sorry, dude!"
  ]
 }

7. Responding to Help Queries

   The appropriate response to /help queries as defined by [IDENTIFIER-
   QUERY] is to use the notices structure as defined in Section 4.3.

   This is an example of a response to a /help query including the
   iiidapConformance data structure.

   {
     "iiidapConformance" :
     [
       "iiidap_level_0"
     ],
     "notices" :
     [

         ],
         "links" :

             "value" : "http://example.net/help",
             "rel" : "alternate",
             "type" : "text/html",
             "href" : "http://www.example.com/auth_policy.html"
           }
         ]
       }
     ]
   }

8. Responding To Searches

   [IDENTIFIER-QUERY] specifies the pattern of searches through the
   names of SLN and ELN. Responses to searches take the form of an
   array of identifier objects. These arrays are contained within the
   response object.

   The following is an elided example of a response to a /names search.

   {
     "iiidapConformance" :
     [
       "iiidap_level_0"
     ],
     ...
     "NodeSearchResults" :
     [
       {
         "identifier" : "86.100.1",
         "regTime" : "2019-12-12T08:57:32.0Z",
         "status" : "ok",
         ...
       },
       {
         "identifier" : "86.100.2",
         "regTime" : "2018-12-12T08:57:32.0Z",
         "status" : "ok",

     ]
   }

9. Indicating Truncated Responses

   In cases where the data of a response needs to be limited or parts
   of the data need to be omitted, the response is considered
   "truncated". A truncated response is still valid JSON, but some of
   the results in a search set or some of the data in an object are not
   provided by the server. A server may indicate this by including a
   typed notice in the response object.

   {
     "iiidapConformance" :
     [
       "iiidap_level_0"
     ],
     "notices" :
     [
       {
         "title" : "Search Policy",
         "type" : "result set truncated due to authorization",
         "description" :
         [
          "Search results are limited to 25 per day per querying IP."
         ],
         "links" :
         [
           {
             "value" : "http://example.net/help",
             "rel" : "alternate",
             "type" : "text/html",
             "href" : "http://www.example.com/search_policy.html"
           }
         ]
       }
     ],
     "domainSearchResults" :
     [
       ...
     ]
   }

   A similar technique can be used with a typed remark where a single
   object has been returned and data in that object has been truncated.

   The following is an elided example of a truncated data.

   {
     "identifier" : "86.100.1",
     "regTime" : "2019-12-12T08:57:32.0Z",
     "status" : "ok",
     "node" :

       {
         "name" : "",
         "nature" : "research institutions",
         "type" : "education",
         ...
    "legalPerson" :
    {
      ...
    }
         "contact" :
    {
      ...
    }
       },

     "remarks" :
     [
       {
         "title" : "Data Policy",
         "type" : "object truncated due to unexplainable reason",
         "description" :
         [
           "Some of the data in this object has been removed."
         ],
         "links" :
         [
           {
             "value" : "http://example.net/help",

10. IANA Considerations

10.1. IIIDAP JSON Media Type Registration

   This specification will register the "application/iiidap+json" media
   type.

   Type name: application

   Subtype name: iiidap+json

   Required parameters: n/a

   Encoding considerations: See Section 3.1 of [RFC6839].

   Security considerations: The media represented by this identifier
   does not have security considerations beyond that found in Section 6
   of [RFC7159].

   Interoperability considerations: There are no known interoperability
   problems regarding this media format.

   Work in progress specification: draft-mcd-identifier-access-
   responce-00

   Applications that use this media type: Implementations of the
   Industrial Internet Identifier Data Access Protocol (IIIDAP).

   Intended usage: COMMON

   Restrictions on usage: none

   Author: Chendi Ma

   Change controller: IETF

   Provisional Registration: No (upon publication of this draft)

11. Security Considerations

   This specification model information serialized in JSON format. As
   JSON is a subset of JavaScript, implementations are advised to


Ma, et al.            Expires January 13, 2021               [Page 20]

Internet-Draft    Identifier Data Response Protocol      July 13, 2020


   follow the security considerations outlined in Section 6 of
   [RFC7159] to prevent code injection.

   Though not specific to JSON, IIIDAP implementers should be aware of
   the security considerations specified in [IDENTIFIER-HTTP] and the
   security requirements and considerations in [IDENTIFIER-SECURITY].

   Finally, service operators should be aware of the privacy mechanisms
   noted in Section 13.

12. Internationalization Considerations

12.1. Character Encoding

   The default text encoding for JSON responses in IIIDAP is UTF-8
   [RFC3629], and all servers and clients MUST support UTF-8.

12.2. URIs and IRIs

   [IDENTIFIER-HTTP] defines the use of URIs and IRIs in IIIDAP.

13. Privacy Considerations

   This specification suggests some of values to identifier information
   that has been marked as private and/or has been removed or obscured,
   except:

   o  identifer

   o  name of a node

   o  type of a node

   o  introduce of a node

   A few of the status values indicate that there are privacy concerns
   associated with the identifier object. The following status codes
   SHOULD be used to describe data elements of a response when
   appropriate:

   o  private -- The object is not be shared in query responses, unless
      the user is authorized to view this information.

   o  removed -- Data elements within the object have been collected
      but have been omitted from the response. This option can be used
      to prevent unauthorized access to associated identifier objects
      without the need to mark them as private.

Internet-Draft    Identifier Data Response Protocol      July 13, 2020


   o  obscured -- Data elements within the object have been collected,
      but the response value has been altered so that values are not
      easily discernible. A value changed from "1212" to "XXXX" is an
      example of obscured data. This option may reveal privacy
      sensitive information and should only be used when data
      sensitivity does not require a more protective option like
      "private" or "removed".
