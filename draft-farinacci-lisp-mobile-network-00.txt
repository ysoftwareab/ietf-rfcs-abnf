1.  Introduction

   The LISP architecture and protocols [RFC6830] introduces two new
   numbering spaces, Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs) and Routing Locators
   (RLOCs) which provide an architecture to build overlays on top of the
   underlying Internet.  Mapping EIDs to RLOC-sets is accomplished with
   a Mapping Database System.  By using a level of indirection for
   routing and addressing, separating an address identifier from its
   location can allow flexible and scalable mobility.  By assigning EIDs
   to mobile devices and RLOCs to the network nodes that support such
   mobile devices, LISP can provide seamless mobility.

   For a reading audience unfamiliar with LISP, a brief tutorial level
   document is available at [I-D.ietf-lisp-introduction].

   This specification will describe how LISP can be used to provide
   layer-3 mobility within and across an LTE [LTE401-3GPP] [LTE402-3GPP]
   and 5G [ARCH5G-3GPP] [PROC5G-3GPP] mobile network.

   The following are the design requirements:

   1.  Layer-3 address mobility is provided within a mobile network RAN
       supported by a pGW region (intra-pGW) as well as across pGW
       regions (inter-pGW).

   2.  UE nodes can get layer-3 address mobility when roaming off the
       mobile network to support Fixed Mobile Convergence [FMC].

   3.  Transport layer session survivability exists while roaming
       within, across, and off of the mobile network.

   4.  No address management is required when UEs roam.  EID addresses
       are assigned to UEs at subscription time.  EIDs can be reassigned
       when UE ownership changes.

   5.  The design will make efficient use of radio resources thereby not
       adding extra headers to packets that traverse the RAN.

   6.  The design can support IPv4 unicast and multicast packet delivery
       and will support IPv6 unicast and multicast packet delivery.

   7.  The design will allow use of both the GTP [GTPv1-3GPP]
       [GTPv2-3GPP] and LISP [I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6830bis] data-planes
       while using the LISP control-plane and mapping system.

   8.  The design can be used for either 4G/LTE and 5G mobile networks
       and may be able to support interworking between the different
       mobile networks.

   The goal of this specification is take advantage of LISP's non-
   disruptive incremental deployment benefits.  This can be achieved by
   changing the fewest number of components in the mobile network.  The
   proposal suggests adding LISP functionality only to eNodeB and pGW
   nodes.  There are no hardware or software changes to the UE devices
   or the RAN to realize this architecture.  The LISP mapping database
   system is deployed as an addition to the mobile network and does not
   require any coordination with existing management and provisioning
   systems.

   Similar ID Oriented Networking (ION) mechanisms for the 5G
   [ARCH5G-3GPP] [PROC5G-3GPP] mobile network are also being considered
   in other standards organizations such as ETSI [ETSI-NGP] and ITU
   [ITU-IMT2020].  The NGMN Alliance describes Locator/ID separation an
   enabler to meet Key Performance Indicator Requirements [NGMN].

2.  Definition of Terms

   xTR:  Is a LISP node in the network that runs the LISP control-plane
      and data-plane protocols according to [I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6830bis]
      and [I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6833bis].  A formal definition of an xTR can
      be found in [RFC6830].  In this specification, a LISP xTR is a
      node that runs the LISP control-plane with the GTP data-plane.

   EID:  Is an Endpoint Identifier.  EIDs are assigned to UEs and other
      Internet nodes in LISP sites.  A formal definition of an EID can
      be found in [RFC6830].

   UE EID:  A UE can be assigned an IPv4 and/or an IPv6 address either
      statically, or dynamically as is the procedure in the mobile
      network today.  These IP addresses are known as LISP EIDs and are
      registered to the LISP mapping system.  These EIDs are used as the
      source address in packets that the UE originates.

   RLOC:  Is an Routing Locator.  RLOCs are assigned to eNodeBs and pGWs
      and other LISP xTRs in LISP sites.  A formal definition of an RLOC
      can be found in [RFC6830].

   Mapping System:  Is the LISP mapping database system that stores EID-
      to-RLOC mappings.  The mapping system is centralized for use and
      distributed to scale and secure deployment.  LISP Map-Register
      messages are used to publish mappings and LISP Map-Requests
      messages are used to lookup mappings.  LISP Map-Reply messages are
      used to return mappings.  EID-records are used as lookup keys, and
      RLOC-records are returned as a result of the lookup.  Details can
      be found in [RFC6833].

   LISP Control-Plane:  In this specification, a LISP xTR runs the LISP
      control-plane which originates, consumes, and processes Map-
      Request, Map-Register, Map-Reply, and Map-Notify messages.

   RAN:  Radio Access Network where UE nodes connect to eNodeB nodes via
      radios to get access to the Internet.

   EPC:  Evolved Packet Core [EPS-3GPP] system is the part of the mobile
      network that allows the RAN to connect to a data packet network.
      The EPC is a term used for the 4G/LTE mobile network.

   GTP:  GTP [GTPv1-3GPP] [GTPv2-3GPP] is the UDP tunneling mechanism
      used in the LTE/4G and 5G mobile network.

   UE:  User Equipment as defined by [GPRS-3GPP] which is typically a
      mobile phone.  The UE is connected to the network across the RAN
      to eNodeB nodes.

Internet-Draft         LISP for the Mobile Network           August 2017


   eNodeB:  Is the device defined by [GPRS-3GPP] which borders the RAN
      and connects UEs to the EPC in a 4G/LTE mobile network.  The
      eNodeB nodes are termination point for a GTP tunnel and are LISP
      xTRs.  The equivalent term in the 5G mobile network is "(R)AN" and
      "5G-NR".  In this document, the two terms are used
      interchangeably.

   pGW:  Is the PDN-Gateway as defined by [GPRS-3GPP] connects the EPC
      in a 4G/LTE mobile network to the Internet.  The pGW nodes are
      termination point for a GTP tunnel and is a LISP xTR.  The
      equivalent user/data-plane term in the 5G mobile network is the
      "UPF", which also has the capability to chain network functions.
      In this document, the two terms are used interchangeably.

   URLLC:  Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency provided by the 5G mobile
      network for the shortest path between UEs [NGMN].

   FMC:  Fixed Mobile Convergence [FMC] is a term used that allows a UE
      device to move to and from the mobile network.  By assigning a
      fixed EID to a UE device, LISP supports transport layer continuity
      between the mobile network and a fixed infrastructure such as a
      WiFi network.

3.  Design Overview

   LISP will provide layer-3 address mobility based on the procedures in
   [I-D.ietf-lisp-eid-mobility] where the EID and RLOCs are not co-
   located.  In this design, the EID is assigned to the UE device and
   the RLOC(s) are assigned to eNodeB nodes.  So any packets going to a
   UE are always encapsulated to the eNodeB that associates with the UE.
   For data flow from the UE to any EIDs (or destinations to non-LISP
   sites) that are outside of the EPC, use the RLOCs of the pGW nodes so
   the pGW can send packets into the Internet core (unencapsulated).

   The following procedures are used to incorporate LISP in the EPC:

   o  UEs are assigned EIDs.  They usually never change.  They identify
      the mobile device and are used for transport connections.  If
      privacy for EIDs is desired, refer to details in
      [I-D.farinacci-lisp-eid-anonymity].

   o  eNodeB nodes are LISP xTRs.  They have GTP, and optionally LISP,
      tunnels to the pGW nodes.  The eNodeB is the RLOC for all EIDs
      assigned to UE devices that are attached to the eNodeB.

   o  pGW nodes are LISP xTRs.  They have GTP, and optionally LISP,
      tunnels to the eNodeB nodes.  The pGW is the RLOC for all traffic
      destined for the Internet.

   o  The LISP mapping system runs in the EPC.  It maps EIDs to RLOC-
      sets.

   o  Traffic from a UE to UE within a pGW region can be encapsulated
      from eNodeB to another eNodeB or via the pGW, acting as an RTR
      [RFC6830], to provide data-plane policy.

   o  Traffic from a UE to UE across a pGW region have these options for
      data flow:

      1.  Encapsulation by a eNodeB in one region to a eNodeB in another
          region.

      2.  Encapsulation by a eNodeB in one region to a pGW in the same
          region and then the pGW reencapsulates to a eNodeB in another
          region.

      3.  Encapsulation by a eNodeB in one region to a pGW in another
          region and then the pGW reencapsulates to a eNodeB in its same
          region

Internet-Draft         LISP for the Mobile Network           August 2017


   o  Note when encapsulation happens between a eNodeB and a pGW, GTP is
      used as the data-plane and when encapsulation between two eNodeBs
      occur, LISP can be used as the data-plane when there is no X2
      interface [X2-3GPP] between the eNodeB nodes.

   o  The pGW nodes register their RLOCs for a default EID-prefix to the
      LISP mapping system.  This is done so eNodeB nodes can find pGW
      nodes to encapsulate to.

   o  The eNodeB nodes register EIDs to the mapping system for the UE
      nodes.  The registration occurs when eNodeB nodes discover the
      layer-3 addresses of the UEs that connect to them.  The eNodeB
      nodes register multiple RLOCs associated with the EIDs to get
      multi-homing and path diversity benefits from the EPC network.

   o  When a UE moves off a eNodeB, the eNodeB node deregisters itself
      as an RLOC for the EID associated with the UE.

   o  Optionally, and for further study for future architectures, the
      eNodeB or pGW could encapsulate to an xTR that is outside of the
      EPC network.  They could encapsulate to a LISP CPE router at a
      branch office, a LISP top-of-rack router in a data center, a LISP
      wifi access-point, LISP border routers at a hub site, and even a
      LISP router running in a VM or container on a server.

4.  Addressing and Routing

   UE based EID addresses will be IPv6 addresses.  It will be determined
   at a future time what length the IPv6 prefix will be to cover all UEs
   in a mobile network.  This coarse IPv6 prefix is called an EID-prefix
   where more-specific EID-prefixes will be allocated out of it for each
   pGW node.  Each pGW node is responsible for advertising the more-
   specific EID-prefix into the Internet routing system so they can
   attract packets from non-EIDs nodes to UE EIDs.

   An RLOC address will either be an IPv4 or IPv6 address depending on
   the support for single or dual-stack address-family in the EPC
   network.  An RLOC-set in the mapping system can have a mixed address-
   family locator set.  There is no requirement for the EPC to change to
   support one address-family or the other.  And there is no requirement
   for the EPC network to support IPv4 multicast or IPv6 multicast.  The
   LISP overlay will support both.

   The only requirement for RLOC addresses is that they are routable in
   the EPC and the Internet core network.

   The requirements of the LISP and GTP data-plane overlay is to support
   a layer-3 overlay network only.  There is no requirement and strongly
   discouraged due to lack of scale, to support extending subnets with
   an layer-2 overlay.  Details about layer-2 overlay complexity and
   lack of scale can be found in [I-D.ietf-lisp-eid-mobility].

5.  eNodeB LISP Functionality

   The eNodeB node runs as a LISP xTR for control-plane functionality
   and runs GTP for data-plane functionality.  Optionally, the LISP
   data-plane can be used to establish dynamic tunnels from one eNodeB
   node to another eNodeB node.

   The eNodeB LISP xTR will follow the procedures of
   [I-D.ietf-lisp-eid-mobility] to discover UE based EIDs, track them by
   monitoring liveness, registering them when appear, and deregistering
   them when they move away.  Since the eNodeB node is an xTR, it is
   acting as a layer-3 router and the GTP tunnel from the eNodeB node to
   the pGW node is realizing a layer-3 overlay.  This will provide
   scaling benefits since broadcast and link-local multicast packets
   won't have to travel across the EPC to the pGW node.

   A day in the life of a UE originated packet:

   1.  The UE node originates an IP packet over the RAN.





Farinacci, et al.       Expires February 5, 2018               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft         LISP for the Mobile Network           August 2017


   2.  The eNodeB receives the packet, extracts the source address from
       the packet, learns the UE based EID, stores its RAN location
       locally and registers the EID to the mapping system.

   3.  The eNodeB extracts the destination address, looks up the address
       in the mapping system.  The lookup returns the RLOC of a pGW node
       if the destination is not an EID or an RLOC eNodeB node if the
       destination is a UE based EID.

   4.  The eNodeB node encapsulates the packet to the RLOC using GTP or
       optionally the LISP data-plane.

   It is important to note that in [I-D.ietf-lisp-eid-mobility], EID
   discovery occurs when a LISP xTR receives an IP or ARP/ND packet.
   However, if there are other methods to discover the EID of a device,
   like in UE call setup, the learning and registration referenced in
   Paragraph 2 can happen before any packet is sent.

6.  pGW LISP Functionality

   The pGW node runs as a LISP xTR for control-plane functionality and
   runs GTP for data-plane functionality.  Optionally, the LISP data-
   plane can be used to establish dynamic tunnels from one pGW node to
   another pGW or eNodeB node.

   The pGW LISP xTR does not follow the EID mobility procedures of
   [I-D.ietf-lisp-eid-mobility] since it is not responsible for
   discovering UE based EIDs.  A pGW LISP xTR simply follows the
   procedures of a PxTR in [RFC6830] and for interworking to non-EID
   sites in [RFC6832].

   A day in the life of a pGW received packet:

   1.  The pGW node receives a IP packet from the Internet core.

   2.  The pGW node extracts the destination address from the packet and
       looks it up in the LISP mapping system.  The lookup returns an
       RLOC of a eNodeB node.  Optionally, the RLOC could be another pGW
       node.

   3.  The pGW node encapsulates the packet to the RLOC using GTP or
       optionally the LISP data-plane.

7.  Compatible Data-Plane using GTP

   Since GTP is a UDP based encapsulating tunnel protocol, it has the
   same benefits as LISP encapsulation.  At this time, there appears to




Farinacci, et al.       Expires February 5, 2018               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft         LISP for the Mobile Network           August 2017


   be no urgent need to not continue to use GTP for tunnels between a
   eNodeB nodes and between a eNodeB node and a pGW node.

   There are differences between GTP tunneling and LISP tunneling.  GTP
   tunnels are setup at call initiation time.  LISP tunnels are
   dynamically encapsulating, used on demand, and don't need setup or
   teardown.  The two tunneling mechanisms are a hard state versus soft
   state tradeoff.

   This specification recommends for early phases of deployment, to use
   GTP as the data-plane so a transition for it to use the LISP control-
   plane can be achieved more easily.  At later phases, the LISP data-
   plane may be considered so a more dynamic way of using tunnels can be
   achieved to support URLLC.

   This specification recommends the use of procedures from
   [I-D.ietf-lisp-eid-mobility] and NOT the use of LISP-MN
   [I-D.ietf-lisp-mn].  Using LISP-MN states that a LISP xTR reside on
   the mobile UE.  This is to be avoided so extra encapsulation header
   overhead is NOT sent on the RAN.  The LISP data-plane or control-
   plane will not run on the UE.

8.  Roaming and Packet Loss

   Using LISP for the data-plane has some advantages in terms of
   providing near-zero packet loss.  In the current mobile network,
   packets are queued on the eNodeB node the UE is roaming to or
   rerouted on the eNodeB node the UE has left.  In the LISP
   architecture, packets can be sent to multiple "roamed-from" and
   "roamed-to" nodes while the UE is moving or is off the RAN.  See
   mechanisms in [I-D.farinacci-lisp-predictive-rlocs] for details.

9.  Mobile Network LISP Mapping System

   The LISP mapping system stores and maintains EID-to-RLOC mappings.
   There are two mapping database transport systems that are available
   for scale, LISP-ALT [RFC6836] and LISP-DDT [RFC8111].  The mapping
   system will store EIDs assigned to UE nodes and the associated RLOCs
   assigned to eNodeB nodes and pGW nodes.  The RLOC addresses are
   routable addresses by the EPC network.

   This specification recommends the use of LISP-DDT.

10.  Multicast Considerations

   Since the mobile network runs the LISP control-plane, and the mapping
   system is available to support EIDs for unicast packet flow, it can




Farinacci, et al.       Expires February 5, 2018               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft         LISP for the Mobile Network           August 2017


   also support multicast packet flow.  Support for multicast can be
   provided by the LISP/GTP overlay with no changes to the EPC network.

   Multicast (S-EID,G) entries can be stored and maintained in the same
   mapping database that is used to store UE based EIDs.  Both Internet
   connected nodes, as well as UE nodes, can source multicast packets.
   The protocol procedures from [I-D.ietf-lisp-signal-free-multicast]
   are followed to make multicast delivery available.  Both multicast
   packet flow and UE mobility can occur at the same time.

   A day in the life of a 1-to-many multicast packet:

   1.  A UE node joins an (S,G) multicast flow by using IGMPv2 or
       IGMPv3.

   2.  The eNodeB node records which UE on the RAN should get packets
       sourced by S and destined for group G.

   3.  The eNodeB node registers the (S,G) entry to the mapping system
       with its RLOC according to the receiver site procedures in
       [I-D.ietf-lisp-signal-free-multicast].  The eNodeB does this to
       show interest in joining the multicast flow.

   4.  When other UE nodes join the same (S,G), their associated eNodeB
       nodes will follow the procedures in steps 1 through 3.

   5.  The (S,G) entry stored in the mapping database has an RLOC-set
       which contains a replication list of all the eNodeB RLOCs that
       registered.

   6.  A multicast packet from source S to destination group G arrives
       at the pGW.  The pGW node looks up (S,G), gets returned the
       replication list of all joined eNodeB nodes and replicates the
       multicast packet by encapsulating the packet to each of them.

   7.  Each eNodeB node decapsulates the packet and delivers the
       multicast packet to one or more IGMP-joined UEs on the RAN.

11.  Security Considerations

   For control-plane authentication and authorization procedures, this
   specification recommends the mechanisms in
   [I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6833bis], LISP-SEC [I-D.ietf-lisp-sec] AND LISP-
   ECDSA [I-D.farinacci-lisp-ecdsa-auth].

   For data-plane privacy procedures, this specification recommends the
   mechanisms in [RFC8061] When the LISP data-plane is used. otherwise,
   the EPC must provide data-plane encryption support.

Internet-Draft         LISP for the Mobile Network           August 2017


12.  IANA Considerations

   There are no specific requests for IANA.

13.  SDO Recommendations

   The authors request other Standards Development Organizations to
   consider LISP as a technology for device mobility.  It is recommended
   to start with this specification as a basis for design and develop
   more deployment details in the appropriate Standards Organizations.
   The authors are willing to facilitate this activity.
