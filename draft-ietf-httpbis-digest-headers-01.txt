                  draft-ietf-httpbis-digest-headers-01

Abstract

   This document defines the Digest and Want-Digest header fields for
   HTTP, thus allowing client and server to negotiate an integrity
   checksum of the exchanged resource representation data.

   This document obsoletes RFC 3230.  It replaces the term "instance"
   with "representation", which makes it consistent with the HTTP
   Semantic and Context defined in RFC 7231.

1.  Introduction

   The core specification of HTTP does not define a means to protect the
   integrity of resources.  When HTTP messages are transferred between
   endpoints, the protocol might choose to make use of features of the
   lower layer in order to provide some integrity protection; for
   instance TCP checksums or TLS records [RFC2818].

   However, there are cases where relying on this alone is insufficient.
   An HTTP-level integrity mechanism that operates independent of
   transfer can be used to detect programming errors and/or corruption
   of data at rest, be used across multiple hops in order to provide
   end-to-end integrity guarantees, aid fault diagnosis across hops and

   system boundaries, and can be used to validate integrity when
   reconstructing a resource fetched using different HTTP connections.

   This document defines a mechanism that acts on HTTP representation-
   data.  It can be combined with other mechanisms that protect
   representation-metadata, such as digital signatures, in order to
   protect the desired parts of an HTTP exchange in whole or in part.

1.1.  A Brief History of Integrity Header Fields

   The Content-MD5 header field was originally introduced to provide
   integrity, but HTTP/1.1 ([RFC7231], Appendix B) obsoleted it:

      The Content-MD5 header field has been removed because it was
      inconsistently implemented with respect to partial responses.

   [RFC3230] provided a more flexible solution introducing the concept
   of "instance", and the header fields "Digest" and "Want-Digest".

1.2.  This Proposal

   The concept of "selected representation" defined in [RFC7231] made
   [RFC3230] definitions inconsistent with the current standard.  A
   refresh was then required.

   This document updates the "Digest" and "Want-Digest" header field
   definitions to align with [RFC7231] concepts.

   This approach can be easily adapted to use-cases where the
   transferred data does require some sort of manipulation to be
   considered a representation or conveys a partial representation of a
   resource (eg.  Range Requests [RFC7233]).

   Changes are semantically compatible with existing implementations and
   better cover both the request and response cases.

   The value of "Digest" is calculated on selected representation, which
   is tied to the value contained in any "Content-Encoding" or "Content-
   Type" header fields.  Therefore, a given resource may have multiple
   different digest values.

   To allow both parties to exchange a Digest of a representation with
   no content codings [3] two more algorithms are added ("ID-SHA-256"
   and "ID-SHA-512").

1.3.  Goals

   The goals of this proposal are:

   1.  Digest coverage for either the resource's "representation data"
       or "selected representation data" communicated via HTTP.

   2.  Support for multiple digest algorithms.

   3.  Negotiation of the use of digests.

   The goals do not include:

   HTTP Message integrity:  The digest mechanism described here does not
      cover the full HTTP message nor its semantic, as representation
      metadata are not included in the checksum.

   Header field integrity:  The digest mechanisms described here cover
      only representation and selected representation data, and do not
      protect the integrity of associated representation metadata or
      other message header fields.

   Authentication:  The digest mechanisms described here are not meant
      to support authentication of the source of a digest or of a
      message or anything else.  These mechanisms, therefore, are not a
      sufficient defense against many kinds of malicious attacks.

   Privacy:  Digest mechanisms do not provide message privacy.

   Authorization:  The digest mechanisms described here are not meant to
      support authorization or other kinds of access controls.

1.4.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 ([RFC2119] and [RFC8174]) when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document uses the Augmented BNF defined in [RFC5234] and updated
   by [RFC7405] along with the "#rule" extension defined in Section 7 of
   [RFC7230].

   The definitions "representation", "selected representation",
   "representation data", "representation metadata", and "payload body"
   in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC7230] and
   [RFC7231].

Internet-Draft               Digest Headers                November 2019


   The definition "validator" in this document is to be interpreted as
   described in Section 7.2 of [RFC7231].

2.  Resource Representation and Representation-Data

   To avoid inconsistencies, an integrity mechanism for HTTP messages
   should decouple the checksum calculation from:

   o  the payload body - which may be altered by mechanism like Range
      Requests [RFC7233] or the method (eg.  HEAD);

   o  and the message body - which depends on "Transfer-Encoding" and
      whatever transformations the intermediaries may apply.

   The following examples show how representation metadata, payload
   transformations and method impacts on the message and payload body.

   Here is a gzip-compressed json object

   Request:

   PUT /entries/1234 HTTP/1.1
   Content-Type: application/json
   Content-Encoding: gzip

   H4sIAItWyFwC/6tWSlSyUlAypANQqgUAREcqfG0AAAA=

   Now the same payload body conveys a malformed json object.

   Request:

   PUT /entries/1234 HTTP/1.1
   Content-Type: application/json

   H4sIAItWyFwC/6tWSlSyUlAypANQqgUAREcqfG0AAAA=

   A Range-Request alters the payload body, conveying a partial
   representation.

   Request:

   GET /entries/1234 HTTP/1.1
   Range: bytes=1-7


   Response:

   HTTP/1.1 206 Partial Content
   Content-Encoding: gzip
   Content-Type: application/json
   Content-Range: bytes 1-7/18

   iwgAla3RXA==

   Now the method too alters the payload body.

   Request:

   HEAD /entries/1234 HTTP/1.1
   Accept: application/json
   Accept-Encoding: gzip


   Response:

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/json
   Content-Encoding: gzip


3.  Digest Algorithm Values

   Digest algorithm values are used to indicate a specific digest
   computation.  For some algorithms, one or more parameters may be
   supplied.

      digest-algorithm = token

   The BNF for "parameter" is as is used in [RFC7230].  All digest-
   algorithm values are case-insensitive.

   The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) acts as a registry for
   digest-algorithm values.  The registry contains the following tokens.

   SHA-256:

      *  Description: The SHA-256 algorithm [RFC6234].  The output of
         this algorithm is encoded using the base64 encoding [RFC4648].

      *  Reference: [UNIX], this document.

      *  Status: standard

   To allow sender and recipient to provide a checksum which is
   independent from "Content-Encoding", the following additional
   algorithms are defined:

   ID-SHA-512:

      *  Description: The sha-512 digest of the representation-data of
         the resource when no content coding is applied (eg.  "Content-
         Encoding: identity")

         Encoding: identity")

      *  Reference: [RFC6234], [RFC4648], this document.

      *  Status: standard

   If other digest-algorithm values are defined, the associated encoding
   MUST either be represented as a quoted string, or MUST NOT include
   ";" or "," in the character sets used for the encoding.

3.1.  Representation Digest

   A representation digest is the value of the output of a digest
   algorithm, together with an indication of the algorithm used (and any
   parameters).

      representation-data-digest = digest-algorithm "="
                                   <encoded digest output>

   As explained in Section 2 the digest is computed on the entire
   selected "representation data" of the resource defined in [RFC7231]:

      representation-data := Content-Encoding( Content-Type( bits ) )

   The encoded digest output uses the encoding format defined for the
   specific digest-algorithm.

3.1.1.  digest-algorithm Encoding Examples

   The "sha-256" digest-algorithm uses base64 encoding.  Note that
   digest-algorithm values are case insensitive.

      sha-256=X48E9qOokqqrvdts8nOJRJN3OWDUoyWxBf7kbu9DBPE=

   The "UNIXsum" digest-algorithm uses ASCII string of decimal digits.

      UNIXsum=30637

4.  Header Field Specifications

   The following headers are defined

4.1.  Want-Digest

   The Want-Digest message header field indicates the sender's desire to
   receive a representation digest on messages associated with the
   request URI and representation metadata.

     Want-Digest = "Want-Digest" ":" OWS 1#want-digest-value
     want-digest-value = digest-algorithm [ ";" "q" "=" qvalue]
     qvalue = ( "0"  [ "."  0*1DIGIT ] ) /  ( "1"  [ "."  0*1( "0" ) ] )

   If a digest-algorithm is not accompanied by a qvalue, it is treated
   as if its associated qvalue were 1.0.

   The sender is willing to accept a digest-algorithm if and only if it
   is listed in a Want-Digest header field of a message, and its qvalue
   is non-zero.

   If multiple acceptable digest-algorithm values are given, the
   sender's preferred digest-algorithm is the one (or ones) with the
   highest qvalue.

   Two examples of its use are

      Want-Digest: sha-256
      Want-Digest: SHA-512;q=0.3, sha-256;q=1, md5;q=0

4.2.  Digest

   The Digest header field provides a digest of the representation data.

      Digest = "Digest" ":" OWS 1#representation-data-digest

   "Representation data" might be:

   o  fully contained in the message body,

   o  partially-contained in the message body,

   o  or not at all contained in the message body.

   The resource is specified by the effective request URI and any
   "validator" contained in the message.

   For example, in a response to a HEAD request, the digest is
   calculated using the representation data that would have been
   enclosed in the payload body if the same request had been a GET.

   Digest can be used in requests too.

   The "Digest" value depends on the representation metadata.

   A Digest header field MAY contain multiple representation-data-digest
   values.  This could be useful for responses expected to reside in
   caches shared by users with different browsers, for example.

   A recipient MAY ignore any or all of the representation-data-digests
   in a Digest header field.  This allows the recipient to chose which
   digest-algorithm(s) to use for validation instead of verifying every
   received representation-data-digest.

   A sender MAY send a representation-data-digest using a digest-
   algorithm without knowing whether the recipient supports the digest-
   algorithm, or even knowing that the recipient will ignore it.

   Two examples of its use are

   Digest: id-sha-512=WZDPaVn/7XgHaAy8pmojAkGWoRx2UFChF41A2svX+TaPm+AbwAgBWnrIiYllu7BNNyealdVLvRwE\nmTHWXvJwew==

5.  Use of Digest when acting on resources

   POST and PATCH requests may appear to convey partial representations
   but are semantically acting on resources.  The enclosed
   representation, including its metadata refers to that action.

   In these requests the representation digest MUST be computed on the
   representation-data of that action.

   This is the only possible choice because representation digest
   requires complete representation metadata (see Section 3.1).

   In responses,

   o  if the representation describes the status of the request,
      "Digest" MUST be computed on the enclosed representation (see
      Section 9.8 );

   o  if there is a referenced resource "Digest" MUST be computed on the
      selected representation of the referenced resource even if that is
      different from the target resource.  That may or may not result in
      computing "Digest" on the enclosed representation.

   The latter case might be done accordingly to the HTTP semantics of
   the given method, for example using the "Content-Location" header
   field.

   Differently from "Content-Location", which is representation
   metadata, the "Location" header field does not affect "Digest".

5.1.  Digest and PATCH

   In PATCH requests the representation digest MUST be computed on the
   patch document.

   This is because the representation metadata refers to the patch
   document and not to the target resource (see Section 2 of [RFC5789]).

   In PATCH responses the representation digest MUST be computed on the
   selected representation of the patched resource.

   "Digest" usage with PATCH is thus very similar to the POST one, but
   with the resource's own semantic partly implied by the method and by
   the patch document.

6.  Deprecate Negotiation of Content-MD5

   This RFC deprecates the negotiation of Content-MD5 as it has been
   obsoleted by [RFC7231]

7.  Broken Cryptographic Algorithms

   The MD5 algorithm MUST NOT be used as it has been found vulnerable to
   collision attacks [CMU-836068].

   The SHA algorithm is NOT RECOMMENDED as it has been found vulnerable
   to collision attacks [IACR-2019-459].

8.  Relationship to Subresource Integrity (SRI)

   Subresource Integrity [SRI] is an integrity mechanism that shares
   some similarities to the present document's mechanism.  However,
   there are differences in motivating factors, threat model and
   specification of integrity digest generation, signalling and
   validation.

   SRI allows a first-party authority to declare an integrity assertion
   on a resource served by a first or third party authority.  This is
   done via the "integrity" attribute that can added to "script" or
   "link" HTML elements.  Therefore, the integrity assertion is always
   made out-of-band to the resource fetch.  In contrast, the "Digest"
   header field is supplied in-band alongside the selected
   representation, meaning that an authority can only declare an
   integrity assertion for itself.  Methods to improve the security
   properties of representation digests are presented in Section 11.
   This contrast is interesting because on one hand self-assertion is
   less likely to be affected by coordination problems such as the
   first-party holding stale information about the third party, but on
   the other hand the self-assertion is only as trustworthy as the
   authority that provided it.

   The SRI "integrity" attribute contains a cryptographic hash algorithm
   and digest value which is similar to "representation-data-digest"
   (see Section 3.1).  The major differences are in serialization
   format.

   The SRI digest value is calculated over the identity encoding of the
   resource, not the selected representation (as specified for
   "representation-data-digest" in this document).  Section 3.4.5 of
   [SRI] describes the benefit of the identity approach - the SRI
   "integrity" attribute can contain multiple algorithm-value pairs
   where each applies to a different identity encoded payload.  This
   allows for protection of distinct resources sharing a URL.  However,
   this is a contrast to the design of representation digests, where
   multiple "Digest" field-values all protect the same representation.

   SRI does not specify handling of partial representation data (e.g.
   Range requests).  In contrast, this document specifies handling in
   terms that are fully compatible with core HTTP concepts (an example
   is provided in Section 9.3).

   SRI specifies strong requirements on the selection of algorithm for
   generation and validation of digests.  In contrast, the requirements
   in this document are weaker.

   SRI defines no method for a client to declare an integrity assertion
   on resources it transfers to a server.  In contrast, the "Digest"
   header field can appear on requests.

8.1.  Supporting Both SRI and Representation Digest

   The SRI and Representation Digest mechanism are different and
   complementary but one is not capable of replacing the other because
   they have have different threat, security and implementation
   properties.

   A user agent that supports both mechanisms is expected to apply the
   rules specified for each but since the two mechanisms are
   independent, the ordering is not important.  However, a user agent
   supporting both could benefit from performing representation digest
   validation first because the it does not require a conversion to into
   identity encoding.

   There is a chance that a user agent supporting both mechanisms may
   find one validates successfully while the other fails.  This document
   specifies no requirements or guidance for user agents that experience
   such cases.

9.  Examples of Unsolicited Digest

   The following examples demonstrate interactions where a server
   responds with a "Digest" header field even though the client did not

9.2.  Server Returns No Representation Data

   As there is no content coding applied, the "sha-256" and the "id-sha-
   256" digest-values are the same.

   Request:

   HEAD /items/123


   Response:

9.3.  Server Returns Partial Representation Data

   Request:

   GET /items/123
   Range: bytes=1-7


   Response:

   HTTP/1.1 206 Partial Content

9.4.  Client and Server Provide Full Representation Data

   The request contains a "Digest" header calculated on the enclosed
   representation.

   It also includes an "Accept-Encoding: br" header field that
   advertises the client supports brotli encoding.

   The response includes a "Content-Encoding: br" that indicates the
   selected representation is brotli encoded.  The "Digest" field-value
   is therefore different compared to the request.

11.  Security Considerations

11.1.  Digest Does Not Protect the Full HTTP Message

   This document specifies a data integrity mechanism that protects HTTP
   "representation data", but not HTTP "representation metadata" header
   fields, from certain kinds of accidental corruption.

   "Digest" is not intended as general protection against malicious
   tampering with HTTP messages, this can be achieved by combining it
   with other approaches such as transport-layer security or digital
   signatures.

11.2.  Broken Cryptographic Algorithms

   Cryptographic algorithms are intended to provide a proof of integrity
   suited towards cryptographic constructions such as signatures.

   However, these rely on collision-resistance for their security proofs
   [CMU-836068].  The MD5 and SHA-1 algorithms are vulnerable to
   collisions attacks, so MD5 MUST NOT be used and SHA-1 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED for use with "Digest".

11.3.  Other Deprecated Algorithms

   The ADLER32 algorithm defined in [RFC1950] has been deprecated by
   [RFC3309] because under certain conditions it provides weak detection
   of errors and is now NOT RECOMMENDED for use with "Digest".

11.4.  Digest for End-to-End Integrity

   "Digest" alone does not provide end-to-end integrity of HTTP messages
   over multiple hops, as it just covers the "representation data" and
   not the "representation metadata".

   Besides, it allows to protect "representation data" from buggy
   manipulation, buggy compression, etc.

Internet-Draft               Digest Headers                November 2019


   Moreover identity digest algorithms (eg.  ID-SHA-256 and ID-SHA-512)
   allow piecing together a resource from different sources (e.g.
   different servers that perhaps apply different content codings)
   enabling the user-agent to detect that the application-layer tasks
   completed properly, before handing off to say the HTML parser, video
   player etc.

   Even a simple mechanism for end-to-end validation is thus valuable.

11.5.  Usage in Signatures

   Digital signatures are widely used together with checksums to provide
   the certain identification of the origin of a message [NIST800-32].
   Such signatures can protect one or more header fields and there are
   additional considerations when "Digest" is included in this set.

   Since the "Digest" header field is a hash of a resource
   representation, it explicitly depends on the "representation
   metadata" (eg. the values of "Content-Type", "Content-Encoding" etc).
   A signature that protects "Digest" but not other "representation
   metadata" may expose the communication to tampering.  For example, an
   actor could manipulate the "Content-Type" field-value and cause a
   digest validation failure at the recipient, preventing the
   application from accessing the representation.  Such an attack
   consumes the resources of both endpoints.

   "Digest" SHOULD always be used over a connection which provides
   integrity at transport layer that protects HTTP header fields.

   A "Digest" header field using NOT RECOMMENDED digest-algorithms
   SHOULD NOT be used in signatures.

Appendix A.  FAQ

   1.  Why remove all references to content-md5?

       Those were unnecessary to understanding and using this spec.

Internet-Draft               Digest Headers                November 2019


   2.  Why remove references to instance manipulation?

       Those were unnecessary for correctly using and applying the spec.
       An example with Range Request is more than enough.  This doc uses
       the term "partial representation" which should group all those
       cases.

   3.  How to use "Digest" with "PATCH" method?

       See Section 5.

   4.  Why remove references to delta-encoding?

       Unnecessary for a correct implementation of this spec.  The
       revised spec can be nicely adapted to "delta encoding", but all
       the references here to delta encoding don't add anything to this
       RFC.  Another job would be to refresh delta encoding.

   5.  Why remove references to Digest Authentication?

       This RFC seems to me completely unrelated to Digest
       Authentication but for the word "Digest".

   6.  What changes in "Want-Digest"?

       We allow to use the "Want-Digest" in responses to advertise the
       supported digest-algorithms and the inability to accept requests
       with unsupported digest-algorithms.

   7.  Does this spec changes supported algorithms?

       This RFC updates [RFC5843] which is still delegated for all
       algorithms updates, and adds two more algorithms: ID-SHA-256 and
       ID-SHA-512 which allows to send a checksum of a resource
       representation with no content codings applied.

Acknowledgements

   The vast majority of this document is inherited from [RFC3230], so
   thanks to J.  Mogul and A.  Van Hoff for their great work.  The
   original idea of refreshing this document arose from an interesting
   discussion with M.  Nottingham, J.  Yasskin and M.  Thomson when
   reviewing the MICE content coding.

Code Samples

   _RFC Editor: Please remove this section before publication._

   How can I generate and validate the Digest values shown in the
   examples throughout this document?

   The following python3 code can be used to generate digests for json
   objects using SHA algorithms for a range of encodings.  Note that
   these are formatted as base64.  This function could be adapted to
   other algorithms and should take into account their specific
   formatting rules.

import base64, json, hashlib, brotli


def digest(item, encoding=lambda x: x, algorithm=hashlib.sha256):
    json_bytes = json.dumps(item).encode()
    content_encoded = encoding(json_bytes)
    checksum_bytes = algorithm(content_encoded).digest()
    return base64.encodebytes(checksum_bytes).strip()


item = {"hello": "world"}

print("Identity encoding, sha256", digest(item))
# Out: Identity encoding, sha256 4REjxQ4yrqUVicfSKYNO/cF9zNj5ANbzgDZt3/h3Qxo=

print("Brotli encoding, sha256", digest(item, encoding=brotli.compress))
# Out: Brotli encoding, sha256 4REjxQ4yrqUVicfSKYNO/cF9zNj5ANbzgDZt3/h3Qxo=

print("Identity encoding, sha512", digest(item, algorithm=hashlib.sha512))
# Out: Identity encoding, sha512 b'WZDPaVn/7XgHaAy8pmojAkGWoRx2UFChF41A2svX+TaPm+AbwAgBWnrIiYllu7BNNyealdVLvRwE\nmTHWXvJwew==\n'
