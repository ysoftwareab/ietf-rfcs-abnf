             Transmission of IPv6 Packets over PLC Networks
                         draft-ietf-6lo-plc-01

Abstract

   Power Line Communication (PLC), namely using the electric-power lines
   for indoor and outdoor communications, has been widely applied to
   support Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), especially smart
   meters for electricity.  The inherent advantage of existing
   electricity infrastructure facilitates the expansion of PLC
   deployments, and moreover, a wide variety of accessible devices
   raises the potential demand of IPv6 for future applications.  This
   document describes how IPv6 packets are transported over constrained
   PLC networks, such as ITU-T G.9903, IEEE 1901.1 and IEEE 1901.2.

1.  Introduction

   The idea of using power lines for both electricity supply and
   communication can be traced back to the beginning of the last
   century.  With the advantage of existing power grid, Power Line
   Communication (PLC) is a good candidate for supporting various
   service scenarios such as in houses and offices, in trains and
   vehicles, in smart grid and advanced metering infrastructure (AMI).
   The data acquisition devices in these scenarios share common features

   such as fixed position, large quantity, low data rate and low power
   consumption.

   Although PLC technology has evolved over several decades, it has not
   been fully adapted for IPv6 based constrained networks.  The 6lo
   related scenarios lie in the low voltage PLC networks with most
   applications in the area of Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI),
   Vehicle-to-Grid communications, in-home energy management and smart
   street lighting.  IPv6 is important for PLC networks, due to its
   large address space and efficent address auto-configuration.  A
   comparison among various existing PLC standards is provided to
   facilitate the selection of the most applicable standard in
   particular scenarios.

   This specification provides a brief overview of PLC technologies.
   Some of them have LLN characteristics, i.e. limited power
   consumption, memory and processing resources.  This specification is
   focused on the transmission of IPv6 packets over those "constrained"
   PLC networks.  The general approach is to adapt elements of the
   6LoWPAN specifications [RFC4944], [RFC6282], and [RFC6775] to
   constrained PLC networks.  Compared to
   [I-D.popa-6lo-6loplc-ipv6-over-ieee19012-networks], this document
   provides a structured and greatly expanded specification of an
   adaptation layer for IPv6 over PLC (6LoPLC) networks.

3.  Overview of PLC

   PLC technology enables convenient two-way communications for home
   users and utility companies to monitor and control electric plugged
   devices such as electricity meters and street lights.  Due to the

   large range of communication frequencies, PLC is generally classified
   into two categories: Narrowband PLC (NBPLC) for automation of sensors
   (which have low frequency band and low power cost), and Broadband PLC
   (BBPLC) for home and industry networking applications.  Various
   standards have been addressed on the MAC and PHY layers for this
   communication technology, e.g.  BBPLC (1.8-250 MHz) including IEEE
   1901 and ITU-T G.hn, and NBPLC (3-500 kHz) including ITU-T G.9902
   (G.hnem), ITU-T G.9903 (G3-PLC) [ITU-T_G.9903], ITU-T G.9904 (PRIME),
   IEEE 1901.2 [IEEE_1901.2] (combination of G3-PLC and PRIME PLC) and
   IEEE 1901.2a [IEEE_1901.2a] (an amendment to IEEE 1901.2).  Moreover,
   recently a new PLC standard IEEE 1901.1 [IEEE_1901.1], which aims at
   the medium frequency band less than 12 MHz, has been published by the
   IEEE standard for Smart Grid Powerline Communication Working Group
   (SGPLC WG).  IEEE 1901.1 balances the needs for bandwidth versus
   communication range, and is thus a promising option for 6lo
   applications.  Currently, this specification is focused on IEEE
   1901.1, IEEE 1901.2 and ITU-T G.9903.

3.1.  Protocol Stack

   The protocol stack for IPv6 over PLC is illustrated in Figure 1.  The
   PLC MAC/PHY layer corresponds to IEEE 1901.1, IEEE 1901.2 or ITU-T
   G.9903.  The 6lo adaptation layer for PLC is illustrated in
   Section 4.  For multihop tree and mesh topologies, a routing protocol
   is likely to be necessary.  The routes can be built in mesh-under
   mode at layer 2 or in route-over mode at layer 3.

3.2.  Addressing Modes

   Each PLC device has a globally unique long address of 48-bit
   ([IEEE_1901.1]) or 64-bit ([IEEE_1901.2], [ITU-T_G.9903]) and a short
   address of 12-bit ([IEEE_1901.1]) or 16-bit ([IEEE_1901.2],
   [ITU-T_G.9903]).  The long address is set by the manufacturer
   according to the IEEE EUI-48 MAC address or the IEEE EUI-64 address.
   Each PLC device joins the network by using the long address and
   communicates with other devices by using the short address after
   joining the network.

3.3.  Maximum Transmission Unit

   The Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of the MAC layer determines
   whether fragmentation and reassembly are needed at the adaptation
   layer of IPv6 over PLC.  IPv6 requires an MTU of 1280 octets or
   greater; thus for a MAC layer with MTU lower than this limit,
   fragmentation and reassembly at the adaptation layer are required.

   The IEEE 1901.1 MAC supports upper layer packets up to 2031 octets.
   The IEEE 1901.2 MAC layer supports the MTU of 1576 octets (the
   original value of 1280 bytes was updated in 2015 [IEEE_1901.2a]).
   Though fragmentation and reassembly are not needed in these two
   technologies, other 6lo functions like header compression are still
   applicable and useful, particularly in high-noise communication
   environments.

   The MTU for ITU-T G.9903 is 400 octets, insufficient for supporting
   IPv6's MTU.  For this reason, fragmentation and reassembly as per
   [RFC4944] MUST be enabled for G.9903-based networks.

3.4.  Routing Protocol

   Routing protocols suitable for use in PLC networks include:

   o  RPL (Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks) [RFC6550]
      is a layer 3 routing protocol.  AODV-RPL [I-D.ietf-roll-aodv-rpl]
      updates RPL to include reactive, point-to-point, and asymmetric
      routing.  IEEE 1901.2 specifies Information Elements (IEs) with
      MAC layer metrics, which can be provided to L3 routing protocol
      for parent selection.  For IPv6-addressable PLC networks, a
      layer-3 routing protocol such as RPL and/or AODV-RPL SHOULD be
      supported in the standard.

   o  IEEE 1901.1 supports L2 routing.  Each PLC node maintains a L2
      routing table, in which each route entry comprises the short
      addresses of the destination and the related next hop.  The route
      entries are built during the network establishment via a pair of

Internet-Draft                IPv6 over PLC                November 2019


      association request/confirmation messages.  The route entries can
      be changed via a pair of proxy change request/confirmation
      messages.  These association and proxy change messages MUST be
      approved by the central coordinator.

   o  LOADng is a reactive protocol operating at layer 2 or layer 3.
      Currently, LOADng is supported in ITU-T G.9903 [ITU-T_G.9903], and
      the IEEE 1901.2 standard refers to ITU-T G.9903 for LOAD-based
      networks.

4.  IPv6 over PLC

   6LoWPAN standards [RFC4944], [RFC6775], and [RFC6282] provides useful
   functionality including link-local IPv6 addresses, stateless address
   auto-configuration, neighbor discovery and header compression.
   However, due to the different characteristics of the PLC media, the
   6LoWPAN adaptation layer cannot perfectly fulfill the requirements.
   Besides, some of the features like fragmentation and reassembly are
   redudant to some PLC technologies.  These considerations suggest the
   need for a dedicated adaptation layer for PLC, which is detailed in
   the following subsections.

4.1.  Stateless Address Autoconfiguration

   To obtain an IPv6 Interface Identifier (IID), a PLC device performs
   stateless address autoconfiguration [RFC4944].  The autoconfiguration
   can be based on either a long or short link-layer address.

   The IID can be based on the device's 48-bit MAC address or its EUI-64
   identifier [EUI-64].  A 48-bit MAC address MUST first be extended to
   a 64-bit Interface ID by inserting 0xFFFE at the fourth and fifth
   octets as specified in [RFC2464].  The IPv6 IID is derived from the
   64-bit Interface ID by inverting the U/L bit [RFC4291].

   For IEEE 1901.2 and ITU-T G.9903, a 48-bit "pseudo-address" is formed
   by the 16-bit PAN ID, 16 zero bits and the 16-bit short address.
   Then, the 64-bit Interface ID MUST be derived by inserting 16-bit
   0xFFFE into as follows:

       16_bit_PAN:00FF:FE00:16_bit_short_address

   For the 12-bit short addresses used by IEEE 1901.1, the 48-bit
   pseudo-address is formed by 24-bit NID (Network IDentifier, YYYYYY),
   12 zero bits and a 12-bit TEI (Terminal Equipment Identifier, XXX).
   The 64-bit Interface ID MUST be derived by inserting 16-bit 0xFFFE
   into this 48-bit pseudo-address as follows:

       YYYY:YYFF:FE00:0XXX

Internet-Draft                IPv6 over PLC                November 2019


   Since the derived Interface ID is not global, the "Universal/Local"
   (U/L) bit (7th bit) and the Individual/Group bit (8th bit) MUST both
   be set to zero.  In order to avoid any ambiguity in the derived
   Interface ID, these two bits MUST NOT be used to generate the PANID
   (for IEEE 1901.2 and ITU-T G.9903) or NID (for IEEE 1901.1).  In
   other words, the PANID or NID MUST always be chosen so that these
   bits are zeros.

   For privacy reasons, the IID derived by the MAC address SHOULD only
   be used for link-local address configuration.  A PLC host SHOULD use
   the IID derived by the link-layer short address to configure the IPv6
   address used for communication with the public network; otherwise,
   the host's MAC address is exposed.

4.2.  IPv6 Link Local Address

   The IPv6 link-local address [RFC4291] for a PLC interface is formed
   by appending the IID, as defined above, to the prefix FE80::/64 (see
   Figure 2).

     +----------+-----------------------+----------------------------+

           Figure 2: IPv6 Link Local Address for a PLC interface

4.3.  Unicast Address Mapping

   The address resolution procedure for mapping IPv6 unicast addresses
   into PLC link-layer addresses follows the general description in
   section 7.2 of [RFC4861].  [RFC6775] improves this procedure by
   eliminating usage of multicast NS.  The resolution is realized by the
   NCEs (neighbor cache entry) created during the address registration
   at the routers.  [RFC8505] further improves the registration
   procedure by enabling multiple LLNs to form an IPv6 subnet, and by
   inserting a link-local address registration to better serve proxy
   registration of new devices.

4.3.1.  Unicast Address Mapping for IEEE 1901.1

   The Source/Target Link-layer Address options for IEEE_1901.1 used in
   the Neighbor Solicitation and Neighbor Advertisement have the
   following form.

   Type: 1 for Source Link-layer Address and 2 for Target Link-layer
         Address.

   Length:  The length of this option (including type and length fields)
         in units of 8 octets.  The value of this field is 1 for the
         16-bit IEEE 1901.2 PLC short addresses.

   PAN ID:  16-bit PAN IDentifier

   Padding:  16 zero bits

   Short Address:  16-bit short address

   In order to avoid the possibility of duplicated IPv6 addresses, the
   value of the PAN ID MUST be chosen so that the 7th and 8th bits of
   the first byte of the PAN ID are both zero.

4.4.  Neighbor Discovery

   Neighbor discovery procedures for 6LoWPAN networks are described in
   Neighbor Discovery Optimization for 6LoWPANs [RFC6775] and [RFC8505].
   These optimizations support the registration of sleeping hosts.
   Although PLC devices are electrically powered, sleeping mode SHOULD
   still be used for power saving.

   For IPv6 address prefix dissemination, Router Solicitations (RS) and
   Router Advertisements (RA) MAY be used as per [RFC6775].  If the PLC
   network uses route-over mesh, the IPv6 prefix MAY be disseminated by
   the layer 3 routing protocol, such as RPL which includes the prefix
   in the DIO message.  In this case, the prefix information option
   (PIO) MUST NOT be included in the Router Advertisement.

   For context information dissemination, Router Advertisements (RA)
   MUST be used as per [RFC6775].  The 6LoWPAN context option (6CO) MUST
   be included in the RA to disseminate the Context IDs used for prefix
   compression.

   For address registration in route-over mode, a PLC device MUST
   register its addresses by sending unicast link-local Neighbor
   Solicitation to the 6LR.  If the registered address is link-local,
   the 6LR SHOULD NOT further register it to the registrar (6LBR, 6BBR).
   Otherwise, the address MUST be registered via an ARO or EARO included
   in the DAR ([RFC6775]) or EDAR ([RFC8505]) messages.  For RFC8505
   compliant PLC devices, the 'R' flag in the EARO MUST be set when
   sending Neighbor Solicitaitons in order to extract the status
   information in the replied Neighbor Advertisements from the 6LR.  If
   DHCPv6 is used to assign addresses or the IPv6 address is derived by
   unique long or short link layer address, Duplicate Address Detection

   (DAD) MUST NOT be utilized.  Otherwise, the DAD MUST be performed at
   the 6LBR (as per [RFC6775]) or proxied by the routing registrar (as
   per [RFC8505]).  The registration status is feedbacked via the DAC or
   EDAC message from the 6LBR and the Neighbor Advertisement (NA) from
   the 6LR.

   For address registration in mesh-under mode, since all the PLC
   devices are the link-local neighbors to the 6LBR, DAR/DAC or EDAR/
   EDAC messages are not required.  A PLC device MUST register its
   addresses by sending the unicast NS message with an ARO or EARO.  The
   registration status is feedbacked via the NA message from the 6LBR.

4.5.  Header Compression

   The compression of IPv6 datagrams within PLC MAC frames refers to
   [RFC6282], which updates [RFC4944].  Header compression as defined in
   [RFC6282] which specifies the compression format for IPv6 datagrams
   on top of IEEE 802.15.4, is included in this document as the basis
   for IPv6 header compression in PLC.  For situations when PLC MAC MTU
   cannot support the 1280-octet IPv6 packet, headers MUST be compressed
   according to [RFC6282] encoding formats.

4.6.  Fragmentation and Reassembly

   PLC differs from other wired technologies in that the communication
   medium is not shielded; thus, to successfully transmit data through
   power lines, PLC Data Link layer provides the function of
   segmentation and reassembly.  A Segment Control Field is defined in
   the MAC frame header regardless of whether segmentation is required.
   The number of data octets of the PHY payload can change dynamically
   based on channel conditions, thus the MAC payload segmentation in the
   MAC sublayer is enabled and guarantees a reliable one-hop data
   transmission.  Fragmentation and reassembly is still required at the
   adaptation layer, if the MAC layer cannot support the minimum MTU
   demanded by IPv6, which is 1280 octets.

   In IEEE 1901.1 and IEEE 1901.2, since the MAC layer supports payloads
   of 2031 octets and 1576 octets respectively, fragmentation is not
   needed for IPv6 packet transmission.  The fragmentation and
   reassembly defined in [RFC4944] SHOULD NOT be used in the 6lo
   adaptation layer of IEEE 1901.2.

   In ITU-T G.9903, the maximum MAC payload size is fixed to 400 octets,
   so to cope with the required MTU of 1280 octets by IPv6,
   fragmentation and reassembly at 6lo adaptation layer MUST be provided
   referring to [RFC4944].

5.  Internet Connectivity Scenarios and Topologies

   The network model can be simplified to two kinds of network devices:
   PAN Coordinator (PANC) and PAN Device.  The PANC is the primary
   coordinator of the PLC subnet and can be seen as a master node; PAN
   Devices are typically PLC meters and sensors.  The PANC also serves
   as the Routing Registrar for proxy registration and DAD procedures,
   making use of the updated registration procedures in [RFC8505].  IPv6
   over PLC networks are built as tree, mesh or star according to the
   use cases.  Every network requires at least one PANC to communicate
   with each PAN Device.  Note that the PLC topologies in this section
   are based on logical connectivity, not physical links.

   The star topology is common in current PLC scenarios.  In single-hop
   star topologies, communication at the link layer only takes place
   between a PAN Device and a PANC.  The PANC typically collects data
   (e.g. a meter reading) from the PAN devices, and then concentrates
   and uploads the data through Ethernet or LPWAN (see Figure 5).  The
   collected data is transmitted by the smart meters through PLC,
   aggregated by a concentrator, sent to the utility and then to a Meter
   Data Management System for data storage, analysis and billing.  This
   topology has been widely applied in the deployment of smart meters,
   especially in apartment buildings.

   A tree topology is useful when the distance between a device A and
   PANC is beyond the PLC allowed limit and there is another device B in
   between able to communicate with both sides.  Device B in this case
   acts both as a PAN Device and a Coordinator.  For this scenario, the
   link layer communications take place between device A and device B,
   and between device B and PANC.  An example of PLC tree network is
   depicted in Figure 6.  This topology can be applied in the smart

   street lighting, where the lights adjust the brightness to reduce
   energy consumption while sensors are deployed on the street lights to
   provide information such as light intensity, temperature, humidity.
   Data transmission distance in the street lighting scenario is
   normally above several kilometers thus the PLC tree network is
   required.  A more sophisticated AMI network may also be constructed
   into the tree topology which is depicted in [RFC8036].  A tree
   topology is suitable for AMI scenarios that require large coverage
   but low density, e.g. the deployment of smart meters in rural areas.
   RPL is suitable for maintenance of a tree topology in which there is
   no need for communication directly between PAN devices.

   Mesh networking in PLC is of great potential applications and has
   been studied for several years.  By connecting all nodes with their
   neighbors in communication range (see Figure 7), mesh topology
   dramatically enhances the communication efficiency and thus expands
   the size of PLC networks.  A simple use case is the smart home
   scenario where the ON/OFF state of air conditioning is controlled by
   the state of home lights (ON/OFF) and doors (OPEN/CLOSE).  AODV-RPL
   enables direct PAN device to PAN device communication, without being
   obliged to transmit frames through the PANC, which is a requirement
   often cited for AMI infrastructure.

6.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations related to this document.

7.  Security Consideration

   Due to the high accessibility of power grid, PLC might be susceptible
   to eavesdropping within its communication coverage, e.g. one
   apartment tenant may have the chance to monitor the other smart
   meters in the same apartment building.  For security consideration,
   link layer security is guaranteed in every PLC technology.

   IP addresses may be used to track devices on the Internet; such
   devices can in turn be linked to individuals and their activities.
   Depending on the application and the actual use pattern, this may be
   undesirable.  To impede tracking, globally unique and non-changing
   characteristics of IP addresses should be avoided, e.g., by
   frequently changing the global prefix and avoiding unique link-layer
   derived IIDs in addresses.  [RFC3315], [RFC3972], [RFC4941],
   [RFC5535], [RFC7217], and [RFC8065] provide valuable information for
   IID formation with improved privacy, and are RECOMMENDED for IPv6
   networks.
