Abstract

   IKEv2 supports mutual authentication of the peers but does not
   support platform integrity validation of the peers nor does it
   support the exchange of data related to the platform integrity
   validation.  This extension allows platform integrity validation
   data to be exchanged from one peer (initiator) to another
   (respondent), allowing the other peer to either use the data for
   statistical analysis, pass it along to a validation entity for
   validation or pass it along to a Fraud Information Gathering System
   for fraud detection or analysis.

Internet-Draft         Integrity Data Exchange         September 2009




1. Introduction

1.1. Motivation

   IKEv2 is used for performing mutual authentication, as well as
   establishing and maintaining IPsec Security Associations (SAs).
   There are an increasing number of peer nodes that are built based
   on trusted platform and/or modules, and thus requiring a successful
   platform integrity validation to be completed as a pre-condition
   for mutual authentication [3GPP].  One of the manners in which
   platform integrity is validated is via platform validation entity
   which is located beyond the endpoint. Another manner in which the
   platform integrity is validated is through self validation by the
   peer.  Both of the validation methods require certain integrity
   related data to be sent to the other peer, whether this data is in
   the form the results of the self validation or in the form of state
   of the platform and/or modules. The scope of platform integrity
   validation is beyond the scope of this document. In the base IKEv2
   protocol [IKEv2], it is not possible to carry and send this kind of
   data in any of the payloads defined.

   The main scenario for INTEGRITY_DATA Notify Payload is to enable
   integrity data to be transported between an initiator (client) and
   a respondent (server).  The respondent may choose to retain the
   information for statistical analysis, send the information to an
   external Fraud Information Gathering System (FIGS), or send the
   information to an external validation entity for validation, all of
   which are out of the scope of this document.

2. Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",

   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].



3. Solution

3.1. Solution Overview

   The responder of the IKEv2 announces support for this IKEv2
   extension by including an INTEGRITY_DATA_SUPPORTED notification in
   the IKE_SA_INIT response. By including the notification payload,
   the responder is implicitly requesting that INTEGRITY_DATA be sent
   from the initiator. If the initiator supports this extension, it


Wong                   Expires March 11, 2010               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft         Integrity Data Exchange         September 2009


   will include the INTEGRITY_DATA notification payload with the
   number of integrity values included in the NUMBER_OF_VALUES field
   of the notification data and each integrity data value in the
   Integrity Data field.  The recipient may choose to store this
   information, or send it to external validation entity or external
   fraud information gathering system for further action, which is
   outside the scope of this document.

   It is assumed that both peers know what INTEGRITY_DATA are
   supported.

             Figure 2: INTEGRITY_DATA being sent in the Notify payload.

3.3. Error Handling


   If the initiator does not support the INTEGRITY_DATA_SUPPORTED
   notification in the IKE_SA_INIT response, the initiator can respond
   with UNSUPPORTED_INTEGRITY_PAYLOAD. The responder may choose to
   continue with the IKEv2 or terminate the IKEv2 process.

   The INTEGRITY_DATA_SUPPORTED notification payload is included in
   the IKE_AUTH exchange to indicate that the implementation supports
   this specification.  The Notify Message Type is TBD-BY-

   Size fields MUST be set to zero, and there is no data associated
   with this Notify type


5. IANA Considerations

   This document defines five new IKEv2 notifications,
   INTEGRITY_DATA_SUPPORTED, INTEGRITY_DATA, INTEGRITY_DATA_ACK,
   INTEGRITY_DATA_REJECT, and UNSUPPORTED_INTEGRITY_PAYLOAD whose
   values are to be allocated from the "IKEv2 Notify Message Types"
   namespace defined in [IKEv2].

   This document does not define any new namespaces to be managed by
   IANA.

6. Security Considerations

   Security considerations for IKEv2 are discussed in [IKEv2]. However,
   the use of integrity data exchanges result in at least one new
   security consideration.

   Replay protection of the integrity data being exchanged needs to be
   considered as a compromised peer node may substitute integrity data
   from an old session.
