Internet-Draft      Dynamic Authorization Server MIB        October 2005


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   It is becoming increasingly important to support Dynamic
   Authorization extensions on the network access server (NAS) devices
   to handle the Disconnect and Change-of-Authorization (CoA) messages
   as described in [RFC3576] .  As a result, the effective management of
   RADIUS Dynamic Authorization entities is of considerable importance.
   This RADIUS Dynamic Authorization Server (DAS) MIB complements the
   managed objects used for managing RADIUS authentication and
   accounting clients as described in [RFC2618] and [RFC2620],
   respectively.  The corresponding version neutral IP address MIBs
   [RFC2618bis] and [RFC2620bis] will obsolete (if approved) [RFC2618]
   and [RFC2620].

1.1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.2.  Terminology

   Dynamic Authorization Server (DAS)

   The component that resides on the NAS which processes the Disconnect
   and Change-of-Authorization (CoA) Request packets [RFC3576] sent by
   the Dynamic Authorization Client.

   Dynamic Authorization Client (DAC)

   The component which sends Disconnect and CoA-Request packets to the
   Dynamic Authorization Server.  While often residing on the RADIUS
   server, it is also possible for this component to be located on a
   separate host, such as a Rating Engine.

   Dynamic Authorization Server Port

   The UDP port on which the Dynamic Authorization Server listens for
   the Disconnect and CoA requests sent by the Dynamic Authorization
   Client.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Overview

   "Dynamic Authorization Extensions to RADIUS" [RFC3576] defines the
   operation of Disconnect-Request, Disconnect-ACK, Disconnect-NAK, CoA-
   Request, CoA-ACK and CoA-NAK packets.  Typically NAS devices
   implement the DAS function, and thus would be expected to implement
   the RADIUS Dynamic Authorization Server MIB, while DACs implement the
   client function, and thus would be expected to implement the RADIUS
   Dynamic Authorization Client MIB.

   However, it is possible for a RADIUS Dynamic Authorization entity to
   perform both client and server functions.  For example, a RADIUS
   proxy may act as a DAS to one or more DACs, while simultaneously
   acting as a DAC to one or more DASs.  In such situations, it is
   expected that RADIUS entities combining client and server
   functionality will support both the client and server MIBs.

   This memo describes the MIB for Dynamic Authorization Servers and
   relates to the following documents as follows:

   [RFC2618] describes the MIB for a RADIUS Authentication Client.

   [RFC2619] describes the MIB for a RADIUS Authentication Server.

   [RFC2620] describes the MIB for a RADIUS Accounting Client.

   [RFC2621] describes the MIB for a RADIUS Accounting Server.

   The above MIBs support IPv4-only address format.  The following MIBs
   support version neutral IP address formats and (if approved) obsolete
   the respective MIBs mentioned above.

   [RFC2618bis] describes the MIB for a RADIUS Auth Client MIB (IPv6).

   [RFC2619bis] describes the MIB for a RADIUS Auth Server MIB (IPv6).

   [RFC2620bis] describes the MIB for a RADIUS Acct Client MIB (IPv6).

   [RFC2621bis] describes the MIB for a RADIUS Acct Server MIB (IPv6).

   [DYNCLNT] describes the MIB for a RADIUS Dynamic Authorization
   Client.

   A NAS typically implements the MIBs for a RADIUS Authentication
   Client, a RADIUS accounting client, and a RADIUS Dynamic
   Authorization Server.  However, there is not strict relationship
   between these three MIBs, i.e. one MIB can be implemented without
   implementing the other MIBs.  Similarly, for the other 3 MIBs

Internet-Draft      Dynamic Authorization Server MIB        October 2005


   mentioned above, a typical case would be where the MIBs for a RADIUS
   authentication server, a RADIUS accounting server, and a RADIUS
   Dynamic Authorization Client are implemented by the same device.
   However, also for these 3 MIBs, they can be implemented independent
   from each other.  A RADIUS proxy might implement any of these 6 MIBs,
   but can also implement any subset of these MIBs.

   Figure 1: Mapping of clients and servers.

   This MIB module for the Dynamic Authorization Server contains the
   following:

   1.  Three scalar objects.

   2.  One Dynamic Authorization Client Table.  This table contains one
   row for each DAC with which the DAS shares a secret.

5.  Security Considerations

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this
   MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an
   intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB
   module via direct SNMP SET operations

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   radiusDynAuthClientAddress and radiusDynAuthClientAddressType

   These can be used to determine the address of the DAC with which the
   DAS is communicating.  This information could be useful in mounting
   an attack on the DAC.

   radiusDynAuthServerIdentifier

   This can be used to determine the Identifier of the DAS.  This
   information could be useful in impersonating the DAS.

   The other readable objects are not really considered as being
   sensitive or vulnerable.  These objects are:

   radiusDynAuthServerDisconInvalidClientAddresses,
   radiusDynAuthServerCoAInvalidClientAddresses,
   radiusDynAuthServDisconRequests,
   radiusDynAuthServDisconAuthOnlyRequests,
   radiusDynAuthServDupDisconRequests,
   radiusDynAuthServDisconAcks,
   radiusDynAuthServDisconNaks,
   radiusDynAuthServDisconNakAuthOnlyRequests,
   radiusDynAuthServDisconNakSessNoContext,
   radiusDynAuthServDisconUserSessRemoved,
   radiusDynAuthServMalformedDisconRequests,
   radiusDynAuthServDisconBadAuthenticators,
   radiusDynAuthServDisconPacketsDropped,
   radiusDynAuthServCoARequests,
   radiusDynAuthServCoAAuthOnlyRequests,
   radiusDynAuthServDupCoARequests,
   radiusDynAuthServCoAAcks,
   radiusDynAuthServCoANaks,
   radiusDynAuthServCoANakAuthOnlyRequests,
   radiusDynAuthServCoANakSessNoContext,
   radiusDynAuthServCoAUserSessChanged,
   radiusDynAuthServMalformedCoARequests,
   radiusDynAuthServCoABadAuthenticators,
   radiusDynAuthServCoAPacketsDropped, and
   radiusDynAuthServUnknownTypes.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
