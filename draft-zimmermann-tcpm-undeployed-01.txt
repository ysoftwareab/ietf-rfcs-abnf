Moving Undeployed TCP Extensions to Historic and Informational Status --
                        An addition to RFC 6247
                  draft-zimmermann-tcpm-undeployed-01

Abstract

   This document reclassifies several TCP extensions that have either
   been superceded or never seen widespread use to Historic status.  The
   affected RFCs are RFC 675, RFC 721, RFC 879, RFC 1078, and RFC 6013.
   Additionally, it reclassifies RFC 813, RFC 814, RFC 816, RFC 817, RFC
   872, RFC 896, and RFC 964 to Informational status.  Most of those
   RFCs are today part of RFC 1122.

Status of this Memo

   This Internet-Draft is submitted in full conformance with the
   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

   Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering
   Task Force (IETF).  Note that other groups may also distribute

1.  Introduction

   TCP has a long history.  Over time, many RFCs accumulated that
   described aspects of the TCP protocol, implementation, and
   extensions.  Some of these have become outdated or simply have never
   seen widespread deployment.  Section 6 and 7.1 of the TCP Roadmap
   document [I-D.ietf-tcpm-tcp-rfc4614bis] already classifies a number
   of TCP extensions as "historic" and describes the reasons for doing
   so, but it does not instruct the RFC Editor and IANA to change the
   status of these RFCs in the RFC database and the relevant IANA
   registries.  The sole purpose of this document is to do just that.
   Please refer to Section 6 and 7.1 of [I-D.ietf-tcpm-tcp-rfc4614bis]
   for justification.


2.  RFC Editor Considerations

   The RFC Editor is requested to change the status of the following
   RFCs to Historic [RFC2026]:

   o  [RFC0675] on "Specification of Internet Transmission Control
      Program"

   o  [RFC0721] on "Out-of-Band Control Signals in a Host-to-Host
      Protocol"

   o  [RFC0879] on "TCP Maximum Segment Size and Related Topics"

   o  [RFC1078] on "TCP port service Multiplexer (TCPMUX)"

   o  [RFC6013] on "TCP Cookie Transactions"

   The RFC Editor is requested to change the status of the following
   RFCs to Informational [RFC2026]:

   o  [RFC0813] on "Window and Acknowledgement Strategy in TCP"

   o  [RFC0814] on "Name, addresses, ports, and routes"

Internet-Draft          Undeployed TCP Extensions              July 2014


   o  [RFC0816] on "Fault Isolation and Recovery

   o  [RFC0817] on "Modularity and efficiency in protocol
      implementation"

   o  [RFC0872] on "TCP-on-a-LAN"

   o  [RFC0896] on "Congestion Control in IP/TCP Internetworks"

   o  [RFC0964] on "Some problems with the specification of the Military
      Standard Transmission Control Protocol"


3.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces no new security considerations.  Each RFC
   listed in this document attempts to address the security
   considerations of the specification it contains.
