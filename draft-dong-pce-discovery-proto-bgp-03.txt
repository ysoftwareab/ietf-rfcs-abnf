      BGP Extensions for Path Computation Element (PCE) Discovery
                 draft-dong-pce-discovery-proto-bgp-03

Abstract

   In networks where Path Computation Element (PCE) is used for
   centralized path computation, it is desirable for Path Computation
   Clients (PCCs) to automatically discover a set of PCEs and select the
   suitable ones to establish the PCEP session.  RFC 5088 and RFC 5089
   define the PCE discovery mechanisms based on Interior Gateway
   Protocols (IGP).  This document describes several scenarios in which
   the IGP based PCE discovery mechanisms cannot be used directly.  This
   document specifies the BGP extensions for PCE discovery in these
   scenarios.  The BGP based PCE discovery mechanism is complementary to
   the existing IGP based mechanisms.

1.  Introduction

   In network scenarios where Path Computation Element (PCE) is used for
   centralized path computation, it is desirable for Path Computation
   Clients (PCCs) to automatically discover a set of PCEs and select the
   suitable ones to establish the PCEP session.  [RFC5088] and [RFC5089]
   define the PCE discovery mechanisms based on Interior Gateway
   Protocols (IGP).  Those IGP based mechanisms may not work in several
   scenarios where the PCEs do not participate in the IGP, and it is
   difficult for PCEs to participate in multiple IGP domains where PCE
   discovery is needed.

   In some scenarios, Backward Recursive Path Computation (BRPC)
   [RFC5441] can be used by cooperating PCEs to compute inter-domain
   path, in which case these cooperating PCEs should be known to each
   other in advance.  In case of inter-AS networks where the PCEs do not
   participate in a common IGP, the existing IGP discovery mechanism
   cannot be used to discover the PCEs in other domains.

Internet-Draft      BGP Extensions for PCE Discovery      September 2015


   In the Hierarchical PCE scenario [RFC6805], the child PCEs need to
   know the address of the parent PCEs.  This cannot be achieved through
   IGP based discovery, as normally the child PCEs and the parent PCE
   are under different administration and reside in different domains.

   Besides, as BGP could be used for north-bound distribution of routing
   and Label Switched Path (LSP) information to PCE as described in
   [I-D.ietf-idr-ls-distribution] [I-D.ietf-idr-te-lsp-distribution] and
   [I-D.ietf-idr-te-pm-bgp], PCEs can obtain the routing information
   without participating in IGP.  In this scenario, some other PCE
   discovery mechanism is needed.

   A detailed set of requirements for a PCE discovery mechanism are
   provided in [RFC4674].

   This document proposes to extend BGP for PCE discovery in the above
   scenarios.  In networks where BGP-LS is used for the north-bound
   routing information distribution to PCE, the BGP based PCE discovery
   can reuse the existing BGP sessions and mechanisms to achieve PCE
   discovery.  It should be noted that in each IGP domain, the IGP based
   PCE discovery mechanism may be used in conjunction with the BGP based
   PCE discovery.  Thus the BGP based PCE discovery is complementary to
   the existing IGP based mechanisms.

                      Figure 1: BGP for PCE discovery

   As shown in the network architecture in Figure 1, BGP is used for
   both routing information distribution and PCE information discovery.
   The routing information is collected from the network elements and
   distributed to PCE, while the PCE discovery information is advertised
   from PCE to PCCs, or between different PCEs.  The PCCs maybe co-
   located with the BGP speakers as shown in Figure 1.  The IGP based
   PCE discovery mechanism may be used for the distribution of PCE
   discovery information in IGP domain.

2.  Carrying PCE Discovery Information in BGP

2.1.  PCE Address Information

   The PCE discovery information is advertised in BGP UPDATE messages
   using the MP_REACH_NLRI and MP_UNREACH_NLRI attributes [RFC4760].
   The AFI and SAFI defined in [I-D.ietf-idr-ls-distribution] are re-
   used, and a new NLRI Type is defined for PCE discovery information as
   below:

   the information source protocol is PCE.

   As defined in [I-D.ietf-idr-ls-distribution], the 64-Bit 'Identifier'
   field is used to identify the "routing universe" where the PCE
   belongs.

2.2.  PCE Discovery TLVs

   The detailed PCE discovery information is carried in the BGP-LS
   attribute [I-D.ietf-idr-ls-distribution] with a new "PCE Discovery
   TLV", which contains a set of sub-TLVs for specific PCE discovery
   information.  The PCE Discovery TLV and sub-TLVs SHOULD only be used
   with the PCE Discovery NLRI.

   The format of the PCE Discovery TLV is shown as below:

                       Figure 3. PCE Discovery TLV

   The PCE Discovery sub-TLVs are listed as below.  The format of the
   PCE Discovery sub-TLVs are consistent with the IGP PCED sub-TLVs as
   defined in [RFC5088] and [RFC5089].  The PATH-SCOPE sub-TLV MUST
   always be carried in the PCE Discovery TLV.  Other PCE Discovery sub-
   TLVs are optional and may facilitate the PCE selection process on the
   PCCs.

     Type |  Length    |      Name
    ------+------------+--------------------------------
     TBD  |     3      |  PATH-SCOPE sub-TLV
     TBD  |  variable  |  PCE-CAP-FLAGS sub-TLV
     TBD  |  variable  |  OSPF-PCE-DOMAIN sub-TLV
     TBD  |  variable  |  IS-IS-PCE-DOMAIN sub-TLV
     TBD  |  variable  |  OSPF-NEIG-PCE-DOMAIN sub-TLV
     TBD  |  variable  |  IS-IS-NEIG-PCE-DOMAIN sub-TLV


   More PCE Discovery sub-TLVs may be defined in future and the format
   SHOULD be in line with the new sub-TLVs defined for IGP based PCE
   discovery.

3.  Operational Considerations

   Existing BGP operational procedures apply to the advertisement of PCE
   discovery information.  This information is treated as pure
   application level data which has no immediate impact on forwarding
   states.  Normal BGP path selection can be applied to PCE Discovery
   NLRI only for the information propagation in the network, while the
   PCE selection on the PCCs would be based on the information carried
   in the PCE Discovery TLV.

   The PCE discovery information is considered relatively stable and
   does not change frequently, thus this information will not bring
   significant impact on the amount of BGP updates in the network.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA needs to assign a new NLRI Type for 'PCE Discovery NLRI' from
   the "BGP-LS NLRI-Types" registry.

   IANA needs to assign a new Protocol-ID for "PCE" from the "BGP-LS
   Protocol-IDs" registry.

   IANA needs to assign a new TLV code point for 'PCE Discovery TLV'
   from the "node anchor, link descriptor and link attribute TLVs"
   registry.

   IANA needs to create a new registry for "PCE Discovery Sub-TLVs".
   The registry will be initialized as shown in section 2.2 of this
   document.

5.  Security Considerations

   Procedures and protocol extensions defined in this document do not
   affect the BGP security model.  See the 'Security Considerations'
   section of [RFC4271] for a discussion of BGP security.  Also refer to
   [RFC4272] and [RFC6952] for analysis of security issues for BGP.
