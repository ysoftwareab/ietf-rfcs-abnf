MSK  = T-PRF(S-IMCK[j], "Session Key Generating Function", 64)
EMSK = T-PRF(S-IMCK[j],"Extended Session Key Generating Function", 64)

      where j is the number of the last successfully executed inner EAP
      method.  If no EAP methods have been negotiated inside the tunnel
      or no EAP methods have been successfully completed inside the
      tunnel, the MSK and EMSK will be generated directly from the
      session_key_seed meaning S-IMCK = session_key_seed.

   PEAPv2 MSK and EMSK derivation

      PEAPv2 derives an Extended Master Session Key (EMSK) which is
      reserved for use in deriving keys in other ciphering applications.
      The compound session key (CSK) is derived on both the peer and EAP
      server.
