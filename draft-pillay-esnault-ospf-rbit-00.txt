                   draft-pillay-esnault-ospf-rbit-00

Abstract

   Open Shortest Path First for IPv6 incorporates an R-bit in the router
   Link State Advertisement that controls whether or not other routers
   will compute transit paths through that node when they perform their
   Shortest Path First computation.  This is a very useful feature of
   the protocol which is currently unavailable in Open Shortest Path
   First Version 2.

   This document extends the Open Shortest Path First Version 2
   specification by adding a similar capability in a way that can safely
   coexist with implementations lacking this feature.

Internet-Draft        OSPFv2 No Transit Capability            March 2010


1.  Introduction

   When OSPFv3 was first developed, a number of improvements were made
   over the existing OSPFv2 protocol.  One of these was the addition of
   the R option bit in the router LSA to indicate whether the originator
   is an active router.  If the "R-bit" is clear, an OSPF speaker can
   actively participate in the protocol without being used to forward
   transit traffic.

   There are a number of cases where this capability is very useful.
   For example, a multi-homed BGP route reflector may want to
   participate in routing, but should not be used to forward non-locally
   addressed packets.

   Note this is not the same capability provided by OSPF Stub Router
   Advertisement [RFC3137].  That technique can be used to make a node
   undesirable for transit traffic by increasing its cost, but other
   routers will still compute paths through it if no others are
   available.

   We presuppose familiarity with the contents of [RFC5340] and
   [RFC2328].

2.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Requirements

   The benefits and considerations associated with deploying an OSPFv2
   no-transit router are similar to those described in section 2.7 of
   [RFC5340].  In addition, a no-transit router should not be an Area
   Border Router or Autonomous System Boundary Router.

4.  New bits in the Router LSA

   Two new bits are defined in the Router-LSA to define the support and
   state of the capability.  The S-Bit is set to indicate that a router
   has the capability to process the R-bit.  The R-bit is clear when a
   router is effectively functioning as a no-transit node.

   S/R possible settings

       1/1 - Router has capability for no-transit and is transit
       1/0 - Router has capability for no-transit and is no-transit
       0/x - Router does not have no-transit capability and

             is always a transit router (backward compatibility)

   All routers implementing this capability MUST set the S-bit in their
   Router-LSAs.  The R-bit SHOULD be set unless the router does not
   participate in any transit routing.

                The OSPFv2 Router LSA with new R and S bits

   R-bit

   The "Router" bit indicates whether the originator is an active
   router.  If the router bit is clear, then routes that transit the
   advertising node cannot be computed.  Clearing the router bit would
   be appropriate for a multi-homed host that wants to participate in

   routing, but does not want to forward non- locally addressed packets.

   S-bit

   The "Support" bit indicates whether the originator can process the
   R-Bit.

5.  Advertising of local addresses in the Router LSA

   When the R-bit is clear in the router-LSA:

   1.  All local addresses on the router are advertised as stub links in
       the router-LSA with a metric set to the interface output cost.

   2.  The cost of other links should be set to LSInfinity as defined in
       section 2 of [RFC3137].

6.  Modification in SPF calculation

   The step 2 in section 16.1 of [RFC2328] is modified as follows:

   Call the vertex just added to the tree vertex V. Examine the LSA
   associated with vertex V. This is a lookup in the Area A's link state
   database based on the Vertex ID.  If this is a router-LSA, and bit V
   of the router-LSA (see Section A.4.2) is set, set Area A's
   TransitCapability to TRUE.  In any case, each link described by the
   LSA gives the cost to an adjacent vertex.

   If all the router-LSAs in the area have the S-Bit set and vertex V is
   a router-LSA with R-bit clear and it is not the root, then all vertex
   V's links are ignored and the next vertex on the candidate list
   should be examined as described in Step 3.

7.  Backward compatibility

   For the modification in the SPF processing defined in section 6 of
   this document to take effect, all routers in the area MUST have the
   S-bit set.

   When an area switches from being all S-bit capable routers to a mix
   of S-bit capable and non-capable, previous no-transit routers may now
   considered as potential transit nodes.  Likewise, when a mixed area
   switches to being all S-bit capable, paths will no longer be computed
   through no-transit nodes.

   If a new router not supporting the R-Bit joins the area (S-bit
   clear):

   1.  The new step defined in section 6 of this document will be
       ignored.

   2.  Any no-transit router with link cost set to LSInfinity will be
       treated like a stub router as defined in [RFC3137].

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.

9.  Security Considerations

   The new extensions defined in this document do not introduce any new
   security concerns other than those already defined in [RFC2328].
