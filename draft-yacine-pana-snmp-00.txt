  Abstract 
    
   The PANA Authentication Agent (PAA) does not necessarily act as an 
   Enforcement Point (EP) to prevent unauthorized access or usage of the 
   network. When a PANA Client (PaC) successfully authenticates itself 
   to the PAA, EP(s) (e.g., access routers) will need to be suitably 
   notified. The PANA working group mandates the use of Simple Network 
   Management Protocol (SNMP) to deliver the authorization information 
   to one or more EPs when the PAA is separated from EPs. 
    
   The present document provides the necessary information and 
   extensions needed to use SNMP as the PAA-2-EP protocol.

  1. Glossary 
    
   PANA  Protocol for Carrying Authentication for Network Access. 
    
   PaC (PANA Client): 
      
     The client side of the protocol that resides in the host device, 
     which is responsible for providing the credentials to prove its 
     identity for network, access authorization. 
      
   DI (Device Identifier): 
      
     The identifier used by the network as a handle to control and 
     police the network access of a client. Depending on the access 
     technology, this identifier might contain any of IP address, link-
     layer address, switch port number, etc. of a connected device. 
      
   PAA (PANA Authentication Agent): 
      
     The access network side entity of the protocol whose responsibility 
     is to verify the credentials provided by a PANA client and grant 
     network access service to the device associated with the client and 
     identified by a DI. 
      
   EP (Enforcement Point): 
      
     A node on the access network where per-packet enforcement policies 
     (i.e., filters) are applied on the inbound and outbound traffic of 
     client devices. Information such as DI and (optionally) 
     cryptographic keys are provided by PAA per client for constructing 
     filters on the EP. 
      
      
 2. Introduction 
    
   Client access authentication should be followed by access control to 
   make sure only authenticated and authorized clients can send and 
   receive IP packets via access network. Access control can involve 
   setting access control lists on the enforcement points. 
   Identification of clients, which are authorized to access the 
   network, is done by the PANA protocol exchange.  
    
   PANA does not assume that the PAA is always co-located with the 
   EP(s). Network access enforcement can be provided by one or more 
   nodes on the same IP subnet as the client (e.g., multiple routers), 
   or on another subnet in the access domain (e.g., gateway to the 
   Internet, depending on the network architecture). When the PAA and 
   the EP(s) are separated, there needs to be another transport for 
   client provisioning. This PAA-2-EP transport is needed to create

   access control lists to allow authenticated and authorized clients' 
   traffic through the EPs. 
    
   The present document provides the necessary information and 
   extensions needed to use SNMP as the PAA-2-EP protocol. 
    
 2.1. Scope 
    
   The next section 3 gives references for the SNMP framework. 
    
   Then section 4 provides a general statement with regards to the 
   applicability of SNMP as the PAA-2-EP protocol.  
    
   Section 5 details the applicability of existing MIB modules to the EP 
   configuration. Some MIB modules were found to have general 
   applicability and varying levels of re-usability for PANA EP 
   configuration using SNMP. 
    
   Section 6 defines additional PANA-specific objects that extend the 
   IPSec MIB module in order to entirely satisfy the PAA-2-EP interface 
   requirements. 
    
   Finally, section 7 addresses the security considerations 
    
    
 3. The Internet-Standard Management Framework 
    
   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current 
   Internet-Standard Management FramewFork, please refer to section 7 of 
   RFC 3410 [SNMP-FRWK]. 
    
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally 
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). 
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the 
   Structure of Management Information (SMI). This memo specifies a MIB 
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, 
   RFC 2578 [SMIv2], STD 58, RFC 2579 [SMI-TC] and STD 58, RFC 2580 
   [RFC2580]. 
    
   This section provides a general statement with regards to the 
   applicability of SNMP as the PAA-EP protocol. This evaluation of SNMP 
   is specific to SNMPv3, which provides the security required for PANA 
   usage. SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c would be inappropriate for PANA since they 
   have been declared Historic, and because their messages have only 
   trivial security.

 4. SNMP Applicability with the PANA framework 
    
   This section provides a general statement with regards to the 
   applicability of SNMP as the PAA-2-EP protocol. This analysis of SNMP 
   is specific to SNMPv3, which provides the security required for PANA 
   usage. SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c would be inappropriate for PANA since they 
   have been declared Historic, and because their messages have only 
   trivial security. 
    
    
 4.1. SNMPv3 General applicability 
    
   The primary advantages of SNMPv3 are that it is a mature, well 
   understood protocol, currently deployed in various scenarios, with 
   mature toolsets available for SNMP managers and agents.  
    
   Application intelligence is captured in MIB modules, rather than in 
   the messaging protocol. MIB modules define a data model of the 
   information that can be collected and configured for a managed 
   functionality. The SNMP messaging protocol transports the data in a 
   standardized format without needing to understand the semantics of 
   the data being transferred. The endpoints of the communication 
   understand the semantics of the data. 
    
   Partly due to the lack of security in SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c, and partly 
   due to variations in configuration requirements across vendors, few 
   MIB modules have been developed that enable standardized 
   configuration of managed devices across vendors. Since monitoring can 
   be done using only a least-common-denominator subset of information 
   across vendors, many MIB modules have been developed to provide 
   standardized monitoring of managed devices. As a result, SNMP has 
   been used primarily for monitoring rather than for configuring 
   network nodes. 
    
   SNMPv3 builds upon the design of widely-deployed SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c 
   versions. Specifically, SNMPv3 shares the separation of data modeling 
   (MIBs) from the protocol to transfer data, so all existing MIBs can 
   be used with SNMPv3. SNMPv3 also uses the SMIv2 standard, and it 
   shares operations and transport with SNMPv2c. The major difference 
   between SNMPv3 and earlier versions is the addition of strong message 
   security and controlled access to data.  
    
   SNMPv3 uses the architecture detailed in [SNMP-ARCH], where all SNMP 
   entities are capable of performing certain functions, such as the 
   generation of requests, response to requests, the generation of 
   asynchronous notifications, the receipt of notifications, and the 
   proxy-forwarding of SNMP messages. SNMP is used to read and 
   manipulate virtual databases of managed-application-specific

   operational parameters and statistics, which are defined in MIB 
   modules. 
    
    
 4.2. Compliancy of SNMP against the PAA-EP requirements 
    
   [PAA-EP-EVAL] gives further details about the choice of SNMP as the 
   PAA-2-EP protocol. 
    
   The following section illustrate how all the requirements as 
   described in [PANA-REQ] are fully supported by SNMP: 
    
    
 4.2.1. 
        EP Configuration information 
    
   The PAA-2-EP protocol must carry DI-based filters and keying 
   material. Using SNMP to configure the EPs, one can re-use existing 
   MIBs, this detailed in section 5. 
    
   Additional PANA-specific objects may be needed and are defined in 
   section 6.  
    
    
 4.2.2. 
        One-to-many PAA-EP relation 
    
   This means that there might be multiple EPs per PAA. The SNMP 
   framework [SNMP-FRWK] clearly states that an SNMP manager (PAA) can 
   communicate simultaneously with several agents (EPs). 
    
    
 4.2.3. 
        Secure Communication 
    
   SNMPv3 includes the User-based Security Model [USM], which defines 
   three standardized methods for providing authentication, 
   confidentiality, and integrity.  Additionally, USM has specific 
   built-in mechanisms for preventing replay attacks including unique 
   protocol engine IDs, timers and counters per engine and time windows 
   for the validity of messages. 
    
   See section 7 for further information on this subject. 
    
    
 4.2.4. 
       New PaC Notification 
    
   PaC may also choose to start sending packets before getting 
   authenticated. In that case, the network should detect this and the 
   PAA must send an unsolicited PANA-Start-Request message to PaC. EP is 
   the node that can detect such activity. In case they are separate, 
   there needs to be an explicit message to prompt PAA.

 Internet Draft     draft-yacine-pana-snmp-00.txt       December 2003 


    
   The PAA-2-EP protocol may allow the EP to notify a new PaC to the 
   PAA. See section 5.1.3 for details on how new and existing SNMP 
   objects provide this feature. 
    
    
 5. Applicability of existing MIB modules  
    
   This section details the applicability of existing MIB modules to the 
   EP configuration. The following existing MIB modules were found to 
   have general applicability and varying levels of re-usability for 
   PANA EP configuration, when PAA and EP are not co-located: 
    
     . IPsec Policy Configuration MIB [IPSEC-MIB] 
     . Differentiated Services MIB [DS-MIB] 
    
    
 5.1. IPSec Policy configuration MIB 
    
   The IPSec Configuration MIB [IPSEC-MIB] defines a configuration MIB 
   module for IPSec [IPSEC]/IKE [IKE] policy. It does not define MIB 
   modules for monitoring the state of an IPsec device. It does not 
   define MIB modules for configuring other policy related actions. The 
   purpose of this MIB module is to allow administrators to be able to 
   configure policy with respect to the IPsec/IKE protocols. However, 
   some of the packet filtering and matching of conditions to actions is 
   of a more general nature than IPsec only. It is possible to add other 
   packet transforming actions to this MIB module if those actions 
   needed to be performed conditionally on filtered traffic. 
    
   The IPSec Configuration MIB is a large MIB designed to support IPSec 
   and IKE management in a policy and rule oriented fashion. The MIB 
   module is divided into 3 portions (Rules, Filters, Actions). 
   Specifically, the IPSec MIB provides a generic mechanism for 
   performing packet processing based on a rule set. Rules within the 
   IPSec Configuration MIB are generic and simply bind a filter to an 
   action. Filters provided within the IPSec MIB itself are numerous and 
   fairly complete for most common packet filtering usage but externally 
   defined filters are supported. The actions encapsulated within the 
   IPSec MIB are mostly related to IKE and IPSec. 
    
    
 5.1.1. 
       IPSec Access Control 
    
   The PANA protocol authenticates the client and also establishes a 
   PANA security association between the PANA client and PANA 
   authentication agent at the end of successful authentication. The 
   PANA authentication agent (PAA) indicates the results of the 
   authentication using the PANA-Bind-Request message wherein it can

 Internet Draft     draft-yacine-pana-snmp-00.txt       December 2003 


   indicate the access control method enforced by the access network and 
   the IP address of the corresponding EP. 
    
   When IPSec is used to perform access control, the PANA protocol 
   [PANA] does not discuss any details of IPsec [IPSEC] SA 
   establishment. Indeed, [PANA-IPSEC] discusses the details for 
   establishing an IPsec security association between the PaC and the 
   EP. When the IPsec SA is successfully established, it can be used to 
   enforce access control and specifically used to prevent the service 
   theft mentioned in [PANA-THREATS].  
    
   In this particular context, one assumes that the following have 
   already happened before the IPSec SA is established: 
    
     1. PANA client (PaC) learns the IP address of the Enforcement Point 
        (EP) during the PANA exchange. 
     2. PaC learns that the network uses IPsec [IPSEC] for securing the 
        link between PaC and EP during the PANA exchange. 
     3. PaC has already acquired an IP address and EP knows about the IP 
        address of the PaC, before the IKE exchange starts. If IPv6 is 
        being used, the EP needs to know both the global address and the 
        link-local address of the PaC.  
    
   The PAA is responsible to communicate to EP the following before IKE 
   phase 1 exchange begins: 
          . the IKE pre-shared key, 
          . the IP address of the PaC, 
          . and the PANA session ID (for pre-shared key derivation). 
    
   When PAA and EP are not co-located, the PAA-2-EP protocol MUST carry 
   this information. SNMP, together with the IPSec Configuration MIB 
   enable such configurations without any modification. The whole 
   behaviour of the EP can be configured by provisioning the IPSec MIB 
   objects. 
    
   For example, the ipspIkeActionTable contains a list of the parameters 
   used for an IKE phase 1 SA negotiation. For further detail, please 
   refer directly to [IPSEC-MIB]. 
    
    
 5.1.2. 
       General Access Control 
    
   More generally, the PAA-2-EP protocol must carry DI-based filters in 
   order to control and police the network access of a PaC. According to 
   the definition of the Device Identifier in [PANA-REQ], such filters, 
   depending on the access technology, might contain any of IP address 
   or link-layer address of a connected device.

   Do note also that keying material might be provisioned for the 
   particular case where access control is performed using IPSec ([PANA-
   IPSEC], see the previous section 5.1.1). 
    
   For Ipv4/v6 address-based filters provisioning, the IPSec 
   configuration MIB [IPSEC-MIB] provides means to filter the traffic 
   based on the IP header information. IPSec MIB-defined 
   IpspIpHeaderFilter provides such facilities: one can define the 
   various tests that are used when evaluating a given IP packet. The 
   results of each test are ANDed together to produce the result of the 
   entire filter. When processing this filter, it is recommended for 
   efficiency reasons that the filter halt processing the instant any of 
   the specified tests fail. The various tests definable in this table 
   are as follows: 
     . Source Address 
     . Destination Address 
     . Source Port Range 
     . Destination Port Range 
     . Protocol 
     . ipv6 Flow Label (Ipv6 only) 
    
   For Layer 2 address-based classification, additional filters might be 
   designed if needed. Section 6 gives an example of the definition of a 
   new IEEE 802-based filter, which may be useful in appropriate access 
   networks. 
    
   IPSec Compound filter and action sequences can be defined for 
   administrators that need more complex or need to chain multiple 
   actions together based on success/failure states. The compound 
   mechanisms are also generic and let PANA-specific MIB elements to be 
   used within the compound bindings. 
    
 5.1.3. 
       New PaC Notification 
    
   The IPSec MIB provides a means to notify to the SNMP manager (PAA) 
   information on packets matching/not matching the filters of given 
   rule. Such notification mechanisms and objects can be re-used for 
   notifying the PAA that unauthorized packets are trying to pass 
   through the EP. 
    
   Section 6 defines a new SNMP notification, which aims at satisfying 
   this requirement. It re-uses existing notification variable objects 
   pre-defined in the IPSec MIB. 
    
   This "New PaC Notification" (panaNewPacNotification) is triggered by 
   the detection by the EP of traffic coming from an unauthorized 
   source. The objects sent must include the ipspIPSourceType, 
   ipspIPSourceAddress, ipspIPDestinationType, and 
   ipspIPDestinationAddress objects to indicate the packet source and

 Internet Draft     draft-yacine-pana-snmp-00.txt       December 2003 


   destination of the packet that triggered the action. Additionally, 
   the ipspIPInterfaceType, ipspIPInterfaceAddress, and 
   ipspPacketDirection objects are included to indicate which interface 
   the action was executed in association with and if the packet was 
   inbound or outbond through the endpoint. See [IPSEC-MIB] for further 
   details. 
    
   Such a notification is able to trigger the sending of PANA-Start-
   Request message from the PAA to newly identified PaC. 
    
    
 5.2. Differentiated Services MIB 
    
   The DiffServ MIB [DS-MIB] is a very powerful and flexible MIB module, 
   however, this flexibility may be too broad in general for the PANA 
   specific needs.  
    
   However, the DiffServ model of using different tables for data path 
   elements could be useful for EP configuration. The DiffServ MIB 
   module connects datapath building blocks (classifiers, meters, static 
   actions, etc.) together. 
    
   The use of RowPointers as connectors in the DiffServ MIB allows for 
   the simple extension of the MIB. The RowPointers, whether "next" or 
   "specific", may point to Entries defined in other MIB modules. This 
   mechanism can point to other, possibly vendor-specific, configuration 
   MIB modules. 
    
   The Diffserv MIB natively provides IP Header-based filters and 
   Drop/Accept basic actions. It can be sufficient in many situations. 
    
   Anyway, the remaining of the document does not further study the 
   DiffServ MIB module applicability to PANA. 
    
    
 6. PANA extension to the IPSec MIB 
    
   Many existing IPSec MIB objects defined in the IPSec Configuration 
   MIB modules can be efficiently re-used for the PANA-specific needs. 
   This is detailed in section 5.1. 
    
   The following sections define additional PANA-specific objects that 
   extend the IPSec MIB module in order to entirely satisfy the PAA-2-EP 
   interface requirements.

           the EtherType field follows the 802 MAC source address. For 
           802.2 LLC/SNAP encapsulation, the EtherType value follows 
           the Organization Code field in the 802.2 SNAP header. The 
           value that is tested with regard to this filter component 
           therefore depends on the data link layer frame format being

   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure 
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on 
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their 
   sensitivity/vulnerability: 
    
   <list the tables and objects and state why they are sensitive> 
    
   -- else if there are no read-write objects in your MIB module 
    
   There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have 
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create. So, if this MIB 
   module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an 
   intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB 
   module via direct SNMP SET operations. 
    
   -- for all MIB modules you must evaluate whether any readable objects 
   -- are sensitive or vulnerable (for instance, if they might reveal 
   -- customer information or violate personal privacy laws such as 
   -- those of the European Union if exposed to unathorized parties) 
    
   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a 
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or 
   vulnerable in some network environments. It is thus important to 
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly 
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over 
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their 
   sensitivity/vulnerability: 
    
   <list the tables and objects and state why they are sensitive>

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. Even 
   if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even 
   then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed 
   to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this 
   MIB module. 
    
   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as 
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [SNMP-FRWK], section 8), 
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for 
   authentication and privacy). 
    
   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an 
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to 
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate 
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
