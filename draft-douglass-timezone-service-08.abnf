lang=<lang-code>  OPTIONAL, but MAY occur multiple times.

tzid=<identifier>  OPTIONAL, and MAY occur multiple times.  MUST
         NOT be present if the "tzid" parameter is present.  If "tzid"
         is specified, a "dtstamp" member MUST be returned in the
         response.  The value of the "dtstamp" member corresponds to the
         entire set of data and allows the client to determine if it
         should refresh its full set.

format=<media-type>  OPTIONAL, but MUST occur only once.

lang=<lang-code>  OPTIONAL, but MAY occur multiple times.

tzid=<identifier>  REQUIRED, and MUST occur only once.  If a value
         of "*" is given, returns data for all timezones.  The "*"
         option will typically be used by servers that wish to retrieve
         the entire set of timezones supported by another server to re-
         synchronize their entire data cache.  Clients will typically
         only retrieve individual timezone data on a case-by-case basis.

substitute-alias=<true|false>  OPTIONAL and defaults to false.  If
         true and the "tzid" value is a timezone alias, it will replace
         the timezone identifier in the returned timezone data.  If
         false, the returned timezone data will use the normal timezone
         identifier.

tzid=<identifier>  REQUIRED, but MUST only occur once.  The value
         "*" is not supported by this action.

lang=<lang-code>  OPTIONAL, but MAY occur multiple times.

start=date or date-time:  OPTIONAL, but MUST occur only once.  If
         present, specifies the start of the period of interest.  If
         omitted, the current year is assumed.
end=date or date-time:  OPTIONAL, but MUST occur only once.  If
         present, specifies the end of the period of interest.  If
         omitted, the current year + 10 is assumed.

name=<text>  REQUIRED, but MUST only occur once.

lang=<lang-code>  OPTIONAL, but MAY occur multiple times.
