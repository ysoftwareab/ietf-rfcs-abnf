1.	INTRODUCTION
This memo provides an overview of the Personal Area Networking specifications, 
phase 1, including design considerations that have led the Bluetooth SIG PAN 
Working Group to specify the PAN Profile [1] and the Bluetooth Networking 
Encapsulation Protocol [2] in its current form. The structure of this document 
is as follows: first the Bluetooth networking stack will be explained (Section 
2), after which an overview of the PAN Working Group will be given (Section 3). 
Then the specifications of the PAN Profile will be discussed (Section 4), and 
architectural design choices that led to these specifications (Section 5). 
Finally some concluding remarks will be given (Section 6).

The Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) has been formed to specify a global 
standard for short-range low-power wireless communications in the license-free 
2.4GHz ISM band. The Bluetooth SIG includes promoter companies, 3COM, Ericsson, 
IBM, Intel, Lucent, Microsoft, Motorola, Nokia and Toshiba, and more than 2000 
Adopter/Associate member companies. The Bluetooth specifications target a small-
form factor, low-cost radio solution providing links between mobile computers, 
mobile phones and other portable handheld devices, and connectivity to the 
Internet. The usage models that the specifications attempt to solve mainly 
relate to cable replacement, and networking to a limited extent.

The goal of the Bluetooth SIG is the development of interoperable products. To 
achieve this, license free specifications (under conditions defined by 
membership agreement) are created for its members for developing and 
manufacturing products and software using the Bluetooth specification. In order 
to adopt the Bluetooth specifications for products, the SIG membership agreement 
has to be signed. This agreement includes a license free Intellectual Property 
policy, strict qualification requirements for Bluetooth-compliant products, and 
a confidentiality rule.

The Bluetooth specifications consist of three parts: the Core specification, the 
Profile specifications, and Test specifications. The Core part specifies

components such as the radio, Baseband, link manager, service discovery 
protocol, transport layer, and interoperability with different communication 
protocols. The Profiles part specifies the protocols and procedures required for 
different types of Bluetooth applications. Section 2 will discuss the specifications in more detail.

2.	STRUCTURE OF THE BLUETOOTH NETWORKING PROTOCOL STACK

When mapping the generic OSI networking reference model to the Bluetooth 
specification, the OSI physical layer is represented by the Bluetooth Radio. The 
part of the data link layer (MAC) is represented by the Baseband, and the upper 
part by L2CAP, and the Link Manager Protocol as link setup and management 
entity. The PAN Profile defined the Bluetooth Networking Encapsulation Protocol 
as network adaptation layer between the Bluetooth data link layer and the IP 
layer. The complete networking reference stack for the PAN Profile is shown in 
Figure 1.

Figure 1. Bluetooth PAN reference model

The Bluetooth Radio follows a hopping sequence, which is dictated by the master 
of the piconet, and followed by all the active slaves (up to seven in total). 
Channel access by the slaves is permitted in the timeslot following the 
reception of a packet from the master. 
The Bluetooth Baseband layer provides mixed links within a piconet i.e. circuit-
switched and packet-switched links. Synchronous Connection-Oriented (SCO) links 
are used for symmetric, synchronous services; such links have a slot reservation 
at fixed intervals and can be used for services such as voice. Asynchronous 
Connection-Less (ACL) links are provided for packet-switched, asynchronous 
services, which may be asymmetric as well. L2CAP mandates the use of ACL links. 
Also packets of different slot lengths are provided by the Baseband layer (one-
slot, three-slot and five-slot packets).

Neither a protocol identifier nor a length field is present in Baseband packets. 
Also segmentation and reassembly is not provided by the Baseband protocol layer. 
Both are provided by the Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP). 




S. Valkenburg, K. Fleming                                               [Page 3]
Internet Draft          PAN Profile design consideration           July 13, 2001

L2CAP defines a channel for each higher layer protocol connection with each 
slave to serve both protocol multiplexing and segmentation and reassembly, 
resulting in a four-byte packet header. Additionally, QoS parameters may be 
negotiated between two L2CAP peer entities.

Every Bluetooth device has a 'Bluetooth Device Address' (BD_ADDR), which is a 
48-bit globally unique IEEE address. The Bluetooth Network Encapsulation 
Protocol (BNEP) uses these addresses in an Ethernet-like header, for the source 
and destination address of hosts in the same logical subnet. This hides the 
star-topology, inherent to the master-slave relationship that exists at Baseband 
level, and the non-symmetric availability of broadcast and multicast.

On top of BNEP, the Internet Protocol operates similar to the way it operates on 
top of Ethernet, as all protocols that operate on top of Ethernet will work on 
top of BNEP. The same applies to TCP and UDP at the transport layer, and session 
and application layer protocols, here referred to as 'networking applications'.


3.	BLUETOOTH SIG PERSONAL AREA NETWORKING WORKING GROUP

After the Bluetooth core specifications and a number of key application profiles 
were specified and released to the public in July 1999, the Bluetooth SIG 
started up several new working groups, chartered to develop more application 
profiles (as well as a working group chartered to develop both new (high-rate) 
and improved radio specifications). These groups were started in January 2000. 
The Personal Area Networking (PAN) working group was one of the newly formed 
working groups; its mission is to "Define/reference dynamic ad-hoc IP-based 
personal networking." The charter of PAN working group is described in Section 
3.1 and its timeline (goals and milestones) are presented in Section 3.2.

3.1 Charter

Upon creation of the working group, the following was given as basis for the 
charter [3]: "PAN networking enables multi-user collaboration by creating ad-hoc 
IP-based personal area networks."

The working group scope is limited to the IP protocol suite, meaning IPv4 and 
IPv6. The solution must also be backward compatibility to Bluetooth v1.1 
specifications for Baseband and L2CAP. The existence of any special purpose 
products or infrastructure is not required for operation, but it will inter-
operate with such devices if they exist, to (a) facilitate the ad-hoc network or 
(b) provide LAN access to a separate wired (or wireless) network. Also, the 
focus must be on reuse of (preferably) royalty-free specifications.

The working assumptions as defined by the working group restrict participation 
in a PAN to IP capable devices (or devices represented to the network by an IP 
capable proxy device). The current PPP solution is recognized to not scale to 
operate efficiently in an ad-hoc network. Finally, a phased approach is taken, 
as the working group recognizes that the final solution for IP based ad-hoc 
networking may take many years to develop. Therefore, the working group expects 
to develop a series of solutions, each solution providing more and more 
features.

Internet Draft          PAN Profile design consideration           July 13, 2001

3.2 Timeline

After its first meeting in January 2000, the PAN working group delivered phase 1 
of the specifications by August 2001. The working group decided to take a phased 
approach for the development of a solution for IP-based ad-hoc networking, as it 
was recognized that proprietary solutions could be emerging before a complete 
solution would be developed, impairing interoperability. 

4. BNEP ARCHITECTURE DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS

The PAN specifications were designed with the charter (see also chapter 3) and a 
set of identified reference usage models as starting point. This section gives 
insight into the design considerations that were made.

4.1 Design criteria

The PAN specifications have to meet general design criteria, and some criteria 
that specifically apply to phase 1 of the PAN specifications (phase 1 for single 
piconet personal area networking, phase 2 for scatternets). The criteria are 
discussed below in this order.

First of all, the solution has to support IP. Support for other networking 
protocols is optional. Supporting IP means support for both IPv4 and IPv6.
The solution has to support Bluetooth specifications v1.1 for Baseband and 
L2CAP. In order to align with the general objectives of Bluetooth, the solution 
has to support both resource-constraint devices such as mobile phones and PDAs, 
as well as devices with less constraint with respect to power, memory and 
computational capabilities such as laptop computers.

Since a phased approach was taken, the initial specification provides a solution 
for IP-based ad-hoc networking for a single Bluetooth Piconet. This solution 
must be extensible towards the second phase (inter-piconet routing), and towards 
enabling support for mobility. Additionally, stand-alone ad-hoc networking as 
well as improved network access (as compared to the LAN Access Profile) must be 
possible with the same solution.

Finally, the solution must contain provisions for security, in such a way that 
it does not decrease the level of security provided by the Bluetooth Core 
specifications.

4.2 Considered alternatives

The main discussion for solving IP-based ad-hoc networking over Bluetooth 
concentrated on the protocol layer to perform the routing/forwarding at.
Routing/forwarding at layer 3 (IP Layer), as well as forwarding/'smart bridging' 
at layer 2 (sub-IP layer or Data Link Layer) were considered. The considered 
alternative solutions are briefly described.

The main alternative for a complete IP-based solution was MANET-style IP 
routing, which basically would be the application of a MANET routing protocol at 
the Piconet master for all incoming IP traffic. An alternative solution 
inherited from the work on the LAN Access Profile, PPP (without HDLC framing) 
directly on the Bluetooth link layer, was not considered a strong contender.

S. Valkenburg, K. Fleming                                               [Page 5]
Internet Draft          PAN Profile design consideration           July 13, 2001

A complete link layer based solution was the counter-proposal to the IP-based 
solution, where a MANET routing protocol would be applied on the link layer,
routing packets based on their MAC address (which is an IEEE-EUI 48-bit address 
in the case of Bluetooth).

Finally, the alternative that received most appreciation proposed link layer 
forwarding within a single piconet. Inter-piconet routing would not be 
considered and solved until phase 2, where the freedom of performing that 
routing at layer 2 or at layer 3 would still be present.

4.3 Design considerations
The selection process of the most favorable alternative, as presented in section 
4.2, was made on a qualitative basis, where the advantages and disadvantages of 
the different alternatives were compared. This prevailed over quantitative 
analysis, since all solutions are expected to perform well within the scope of a 
single piconet.

The presentation of Bluetooth as networking interface to the IP stack was a 
primary consideration. Bluetooth should not be anything more than 'another' 
interface, meaning one could plug in a Bluetooth interface in a device with a 
networking stack, install the appropriate driver, and be able to communicate. 
>From this point of view, changes to the IP stack are undesirable implications. 
The same applies to the level of support for both IPv4 and IPv6 i.e. separate 
solutions need to be developed for both IPv4 and IPv6. Support for other, non-IP 
protocols is an additional advantage. Emulating a known and widely used medium 
below IP (Ethernet) provides support for any networking protocol.

Requirements from the IP layer and above are the support for broadcast and 
multicast at the link layer. Experiences with other communication technologies 
shows that IP works far better on media that naturally support such point-to-
multipoint capabilities, than on media that have to create such support 
artificially. Bluetooth does not have this point-to-multipoint support naturally 
either. However, every Bluetooth device has an IEEE-administered hardware 
address. This address space also supports multicast and broadcast addresses, in 
a way that naturally fits IP. The only thing lacking is mapping these point-to-
multipoint capabilities to the Bluetooth Piconet topology, which can easily be 
done by the piconet master, since it is in control of the piconet.

Zeroconfiguration of IP addresses and other IP interface parameters, using 
mechanisms such as those defined by the Zeroconf working group, need to be 
supported in order to provide a user-friendly way of stand-alone ad-hoc 
networking and infrastructure access, as well as migration between these two 
scenarios. Added to this consideration, flexible dynamic access to external 
(non-Bluetooth) networks also has to be supported in order to meet the design 
criteria (see section 4.1). For this, the emulation of a single Ethernet segment 
as provided by BNEP provides a degree of freedom for a Network Access Point, to 
either be a router or a bridge, as well as flexible support for the above 
mentioned design considerations.

5.	BLUETOOTH PAN SPECIFICATIONS, PHASE 1
The PAN Profile specifications, phase 1, consists of two parts. The Bluetooth 
Network Encapsulation Protocol is the adaptation layer hiding the Bluetooth
 specifics, and described in Section 5.1). The PAN Profile specifies how to use

S. Valkenburg, K. Fleming                                               [Page 6]
Internet Draft          PAN Profile design consideration           July 13, 2001

 the different building blocks of the Bluetooth Core specifications [4] and 
other protocol layers, such that interoperability is ensured. The main features 
are described in Section 4.2.

5.1 Bluetooth Network Encapsulation Protocol (BNEP)

The design considerations described in Section 4 led to the development of the 
Bluetooth Network Encapsulation Protocol (BNEP). BNEP hides Bluetooth specifics, 
including the piconet topology, and emulates a broadcast network segment. This 
is based on the format of a widely used local area networking technology, 
Ethernet. Extensions are added to this to increase efficiency of operation, to 
suit general demands by wireless communication and battery operated devices. 
Also the concept of extension headers is added to provide support for adding 
additional capabilities and for support in phases 2.

BNEP encapsulates IP packets in BNEP packets, which in turn are encapsulated in 
L2CAP packets. The header format is shown in Figure 2. BNEP encapsulated packets 
are used to transport packets between two link-layer end-points on an IP 
segment. The IP segment can extend beyond the Bluetooth network, if connected to 
another (wired or wireless) network by a bridge. An L2CAP packet containing a 
BNEP packet is carried over an L2CAP channel for BNEP, established using the PSM 
value assigned to BNEP [5].

S. Valkenburg, K. Fleming                                               [Page 7]

Internet Draft          PAN Profile design consideration           July 13, 2001

Destination Address     48-bit Bluetooth device address/IEEE address of the 
                        destination of the BNEP packet/Ethernet frame contained 
                        in the payload. IEEE broadcast and addresses are used 
                        for broadcast and multicast packets.

Source Address          48-bit Bluetooth device address/IEEE address of the 
                        source of the BNEP packet/Ethernet frame contained in 
                        the payload.

Networking Protocol Type  6-bit type field identifies the type of networking
                        protocol contained in the payload. The values for this 
                        field are the same as defined for Ethernet types [6].

EH/Payload              BNEP extension header(s) and/or BNEP payload.

During setup of each Bluetooth connection between two devices, the BD_ADDR of 
the peer devices is learned during Baseband setup procedure. This address is 
subsequently associated with the L2CAP channel for BNEP (see [4] for details). 
The source and/or destination address can therefore be left out in some cases, 
as a means to reduce the amount of overhead introduced by BNEP. Three header 
formats have been defined for this purpose. For direct communication between a 
piconet master and slave, both the source and destination addresses may be left 
out. In other situations, either the source or destination address may be left 
out.

Additionally, BNEP connection control messages have been defined. Before 
completion of the BNEP connection setup, the initiator has to indicate the roles 
of both end-points. For bandwidth saving purposes, protocol and multicast filter 
commands have been defined to indicate which protocol types and multicast 
addresses a PANU wants to receive. All these control messages have to be 
confirmed before the new configuration applies.

For future extension of BNEP, extension headers have been defined. These 
extension headers follow the BNEP header. The format of these extension headers 
is similar to the IPv6 extension headers, with a type-length-value encoding.

5.2 Bluetooth PAN Profile

A Bluetooth "Profile" specifies the protocols and procedures required for 
different kind of applications. In the case of the PAN Profile, the protocols 
and procedures that enable IP networking over Bluetooth are specified. This 
includes the behavior reflecting the role of a device in a Bluetooth PAN, as 
well as how to use certain protocols at certain levels. The minimal set of IP 
functionality is described in Section 5.2.1, other supported functionality is 
described in Section 5.2.2.The different roles of devices participating in a PAN 
are described in Section 5.2.3.

5.2.1 Required IP functionality

As the PAN Profile defines IP networking over Bluetooth, a minimal set of IP 
protocols is required. The PAN Profile mandates that IPv4 and/or IPv6 is 


S. Valkenburg, K. Fleming                                               [Page 8]

Internet Draft          PAN Profile design consideration           July 13, 2001

supported. IP operates on top of BNEP (see Section 5.1). The minimal set of RFCs 
identified to support IP in an interoperable way is listed in Table 1 for IPv4 
and in Table 2 for IPv6. Additionally, some functionality is strongly 
recommended. The corresponding RFCs are also listed for each version. Inclusion 
of additional RFCs is optional for PAN-capable devices.

Internet Draft          PAN Profile design consideration           July 13, 2001

The set of recommended RFCs is recognized to be part of the minimal IP 
functionality. However, certain resource-constraint devices may never use this 
functionality. E.g. devices that do not have a user interface will not invoke 
name-to-address resolution, or devices that only communicate on their local IP 
subnet will not need stateful address autoconfiguration.

5.2.2	Other supported functionality
In addition to the IP functionality descibed in Section 5.2.1, other protocols 
are enabled by the PAN Profile. The IEEE 802.1p standard for packet priority and 
802.1x for link layer authentication and key exchange and supported by the PAN 
Profile as optional mechanisms.

5.2.2 Different roles in the Bluetooth PAN Profile

The Bluetooth PAN Profile defines three roles and two configurations. Their 
functionality is discussed in this section.

The PAN Profile identifies two configurations of a Bluetooth PAN, one where the 
PAN is connected to an external network via a Network Access Point (NAP), and 
one where the PAN operates completely stand-alone. The latter is controlled by 
the Group Ad-hoc Node (GN). In both cases, the Bluetooth device that uses the 
respective services of these devices (NAP service and GN service) is the PAN 
User (PANU). The support of different roles is discovered using the Bluetooth 
Service Discovery Protocol [4].

A Bluetooth device that supports the NAP service is a device that provides some 
of the features of an Ethernet bridge to support network services. The device 
with the NAP service forwards BNEP packets between each of the connected 
Bluetooth devices (PANUs). The device with the NAP service has an additional 
network connection to a different network media in which the Ethernet packets 
are either exchanged via Layer 2 bridging or Layer 3 routing mechanism.  These 
devices may require additional functionality when bridging to additional 
networks, (e.g. GPRS).

A Bluetooth device that supports the GN service is able to forward Ethernet 
packets to each of the connected PANUs. GNs do not provide access to any 
additional networks.  Instead, GNs are intended to allow a group of devices to 
form temporary networks and exchange information.

A PANU is the Bluetooth device that uses either the NAP or the GN service.  PANU 
supports the client role for both the NAP and GN roles. The PANU has a BNEP 
connection with the NAP or GN. A PANU must become a piconet slave if the NAP or 
GN is configured in multi-user mode.

The NAP and GN forward BNEP packets between PANUs according to the IEEE 802.1D 
standard [7], where each BNEP connection is regarded as a valid Bridge Port. 
Depending on the protocol and multicast filters, this may apply to the 
forwarding of broadcast and multicast packets, even though it is recognized that 
this is wasteful of the piconet bandwidth in case more than one PANU is 
connected.

6.	CONCLUSIONS

This memo provided an overview of the Bluetooth PAN Profile and the BNEP 
specification as developed by the Bluetooth SIG Personal Area Networking working 
group, and describes some of the design decisions.  PAN Profile and BNEP present 
an Ethernet-like interface on top of Bluetooth, which supports the various 
networking protocols, including IPv4 and IPv6.  Often the additional overhead of 
BNEP is only 3 bytes, but the benefit of BNEP outweighs this additional overhead 
by providing a broadcast medium towards the networking layer, support for IEEE 
802.1p (Packet Priority), IEEE 802.1x (link layer authentication and key 
exchange), and support for a wide array of networking protocols.
