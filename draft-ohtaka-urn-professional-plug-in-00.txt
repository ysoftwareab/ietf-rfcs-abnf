1.  Introduction

   Professional-Plug-in is a system which defines a solid-state storage 
   media and a variety of multimedia contents stored on this storage media. 
   The Professional-Plug-in is applicable for content acquisition systems, 
   editing systems and servers as well as for transfer of content files. 
   In order to assure interoperability among different vendors, 
   specifications that define a video, audio essence and associated 
   metadata have been established. The metadata contains information about 
   the structure or parameters of the video, audio essences and also contains 
   additional information describing the essences. The metadata is 
   expressed with an XML specified by an XML schema. Therefore, 
   a Uniform Resource Name (URN) specified in this document is applied to 
   assign a persistent resource for the namespace to identify each XML schema. 

2.  Specification Template

   This namespace specification is for a formal namespace.

2.1 Namespace ID:

   "Professional-Plug-in"

2.2 Registration Information:

   Version: 1.0
   Date: 14 May 2007

2.3 Declared registrant of the namespace:

   Name:           Hideki Ohtaka
   Organization    Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd.
   Address:        2-15 Matsuba-cho, Kadoma City, Osaka 571-8503, Japan

Internet-Draft      URN Namespace for Professional Plug-in      May 2007

2.4 Declaration of structure:

   URN assigned for Professional-Plug-in has the following structure.

   URN:schemas-Professional-Plug-in:NSS

   The NSS shall comply with the following ABNF specification.

   NSS             = SystemName ":" AssignedString ":" AssignedString ":" ----
   SystemName      = ALPHA / DIGIT / other
   AssignedString  = ALPHA / DIGIT / other
   other           = "-" / "_" / "."
   Note: Another character may not be the first character.
  
2.5 Relevant ancillary documentation:

   Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Third Edition), W3C Recommendation 04 
   February 2004

   Namespaces in XML, W3C Recommendation, 14,January 1999

   SMPTE RP 2002 Content Specification on Solid-State Media Card 
   - for DV/DV-based Essence : This document defines the XML schema specified 
   by the namespace using the requested NID. 

2.6 Identifier uniqueness considerations:

   Developers who wish to define a new system name under this proposed NID 
   for their applications must ask the URN administrator (Matsushita Electric) 
   to assign a system name as NSS. The URN administrator confirms that the new 
   system name is unique against existing system names, and then assigns and 
   registers the new system name as NSS.

2.7 Identifier persistence considerations:

   Persistence of identifiers is dependent upon the persistence of the system 
   name assignment by the URN administrator.

2.8 Process of identifier assignment:

   Request for the assignment of a new system name including objectives of 
   the request must be sent to the URN administrator and the URN administrator 
   assigns the new system name as NSS.

2.9 Process of identifier resolution:
   
   The URN administrator will maintain an index of assigned URNs
   That index will map URNs to XML schema specifications in the Web page.
  
2.10 Rules for Lexical Equivalence:
 
   The entire URN is case-insensitive.

Internet-Draft      URN Namespace for Professional Plug-in      May 2007

2.11 Conformance with URN Syntax:

   No special considerations. 
   URNs in this namespace conform to RFC 2141.

2.12 Validation mechanism:

   None specified.

2.13 Scope:

   Global

   The following is an example of the URN.

3.  Examples

   URN:schemas-Professional-Plug-in:P2:ClipMetadata:v2.0

   System name     = P2: Specifies the system 
   Assigned string = ClipMetadata: Specifies the type of metadata
                                   ClipMetadata means the Metadata schema 
                                   related to a Clip  
   Assigned string = v2.0: Specifies the version of this schema 

4.  Namespace Considerations

4.1 URN assignment procedures:

   Existing URNs are intended to be assigned as identifiers for particular 
   applications or particular systems. The purpose of these URNs and its 
   assignment procedure is clearly defined in each RFC document. Meanwhile, 
   this requested URN is intended to be used for a namespace to identify an 
   XML schema in Professional-Plug-in system so the metadata specified with 
   an XML schema is closely associated with its individual system and 
   applications. The existing URNs, however, do not provide any alternative 
   namespaces which represent the metadata in the Professional-Plug-in system. 
   Therefore, a new URN assignment is required and individual URNs shall be 
   assigned through the process of development of each XML schema.  

4.2 URN resolution/delegation:

   The resolution and delegation shall be determined through the process of 
   development of an XML schema for metadata.

4.3 Type of resources to be identified:

   Types of resources to be identified include an XML schema for metadata.

5.  Community Considerations

5.1 Open assignment and use of identifiers within the namespace:

  Professional-Plug-in system can be applicable for content acquisition 
  systems, editing systems and so on. Therefore, any developers who wish to 
  define an XML schema depending on each application can apply for a URN 
  under the Professional-Plug-in namespace. The proposed URN shall be reviewed 
  among developers of the Professional-Plug-in system, and shall be assigned 
  and presented as a new URN under this namespace.

6.  Security Considerations

   There are no additional security considerations other than those
   normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general.

7.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA has registered formal URN namespace XXXX, to 
   Professional-Plug-in within the IANA registry of URN NIDs.

8.  Normative References
