Abstract

   Due to fact that mobile ad hoc nodes have a critical need to preserve
   battery power, MANET routing protocols need to consider power saving
   techniques during operations. In this Internet-Draft we discuss PARO,
   a Power-Aware Routing Optimization protocol that minimizes the
   transmission power necessary to forward packets between wireless
   devices. Using PARO, intermediate nodes can forward packets between
   source-destination pairs thus reducing the aggregate transmission
   power consumed by wireless devices. An important property of PARO is
   that it outperforms traditional broadcast-based routing protocols due
   to its power efficient point-to-point on-demand nature. The protocol
   is designed to operate as a stand-alone multihop routing protocol for
   local-area wireless networks (e.g., single-hop home networks, single-
   hop sensor networks, WLANs, etc.) and as a power-aware enhancement
   for routing in wide-area MANETs.

1. Introduction

   Transmission power control used for communications impacts the
   operational lifetime of devices in different ways depending on the
   average transmission power consumption compared to the total average
   power consumption of a device. For devices where transmission power
   accounts for only a small percentage of the overall power consumed
   (e.g., a wireless LAN radio attached to a notebook computer) reducing
   or increasing the transmission power may not significantly impact the
   device's operational lifetime. In contrast, for small
   computing/communication devices with built-in/attached radios (e.g.,
   cellular phones, PDAs, etc.) reducing transmission power may extend
   the operational lifetime of a device significantly, thus, enhancing
   the overall user experience.

   This memo specifies PARO, a power-aware routing optimization protocol
   for wireless networks where all nodes are located within the maximum
   transmission range of each other. PARO can also perform power
   optimization as a layer 2.5 routing scheme operating below
   traditional layer 3 wide-area ad-hoc routing protocols. PARO uses

   packet forwarding as a way to reduce the transmission power necessary
   to deliver packets in the network, thus increasing the operational
   lifetime of networked devices.

1.1. Applicability

   PARO is applicable to wireless networks where all nodes are located
   within transmission range of each other. To provide out-of-range
   power-aware routing support, a layer 3 ad-hoc routing protocol (e.g.,
   MANET routing protocol) should be used above PARO.

1.3  Motivation

      Typically, more power is consumed during the transmission of
      packets than their reception or during ``listening'' periods.
      Transmission to a distant device at higher power levels may
      consume a disproportionate amount of power in comparison to
      transmission to a node in closer proximity. Figure 1 shows an
      example of a network composed of three nodes located within
      transmission range of each other. In this case, nodes A and B use
      node C to forward packets to each other. The fact is that packet
      forwarding can significantly reduce the transmission power
      necessary to deliver packets between A and B nodes when node C is
      located near the mid point, between nodes A and B. More than one
      forwarding node can be added between source-destination nodes
      resulting in even lower aggregate transmission power.

              A                      C                       B

                    Figure 1. Example of packet forwarding

      In PARO, we propose that intermediate nodes forward packets
      between source and destination pairs even if source-destination
      pairs are located within direct transmission range of each other.
      This operation requires that radios are capable of adjusting
      transmission power on a per-packet basis. A consequence of this
      approach is that traditional single-hop networks (e.g., local area
      networks) can be considered as multi-hop networks requiring
      routing protocols (similar to that found in traditional wide-area
      ad-hoc networks) for data forwarding.

      One common property of most wide-area routing protocols [1] [2]
      [3] is that they discover routes using different versions of
      ``flooding-broadcast protocols'' by transmitting with maximum
      power in order to minimize the number of forwarding nodes between
      any source-destination pair. MANET routing protocols are based on
      this principle and attempt to minimize the number of hops between
      source-destination pairs. A good broadcast flooding algorithm is
      crucial to the operation of any wide-area routing protocol to
      ensure all nodes maintain identical routing databases. Delivering
      data packets in a wireless network using a traditional ``minimum-
      hop route'', however, require more transmission power to reach the
      destination compared to an alternative approach that uses more
      intermediate nodes.

      Increasing the number of intermediate hops can be achieved by
      reducing the transmission range used to discover routes in the
      network. Reducing the transmission range, however, has the effect
      of increasing the number of signaling packets transmitted.
      However, a linear decrease in transmission power generates an
      exponential increase of the number of signaling packets
      transmitted to completely flood the network. In addition, it is
      not possible to arbitrarily reduce the transmission power to any



Gomez, Campbell, Naghshineh,Bisdikian     Expires September 2001[Page 4]





INTERNET-DRAFT      Power-Aware Routing Optimization    26 February 2001


      value, thus potentially maximizing the number of forwarding nodes
      between source destination pairs. Rather, there is a limitation on
      the lower bound of transmission power needed to completely flood
      routing information in the network that depends on the density
      distribution of nodes in the network. This limitation restricts
      nodes discovering some routes to other nodes if they use a
      transmission power smaller than the "critical transmission power".
      Signaling packets transmitted using less power than the critical
      transmission power are likely to get lost rather than reaching the
      final destination node.

      Due to these challenges, wide-area routing approaches based on
      broadcast flooding techniques are either inefficient (e.g., they
      generate too many signaling packets for low broadcast transmission
      power) or incapable of discovering routes that ``maximize'' the
      number of intermediate forwarding nodes between source-destination
      nodes, thus minimizing transmission power. The existing MANET
      routing protocols are designed to use flooding techniques at
      maximum power to discover routes. In addition, these protocols are
      optimized to ``minimize'' the number of hops between source-
      destination pairs so as to promote minimum end-to-end delay.
      Because of these characteristics (i.e., flooding using maximum
      power and maximizing the number of hops), MANET routing protocols
      may not provide a suitable foundation for power-aware routing in
      ad-hoc networks. As a result, there is a need to develop new
      power-aware routing approaches.

1.4. Protocol Overview

      The design of a power-efficient routing protocol should consider
      both data transmission and route discovery. In terms of power
      transmission, these protocols should be capable of efficiently
      discovering routes involving multiple hops, thus minimizing the
      transmission power in comparison to standard flooding-based ad-hoc
      routing designs. PARO departs from traditional broadcast-based
      design, and supports a node-to-node based routing approach that is
      more suited to efficiently discovering power-aware routes in
      wireless ad-hoc networks. In what follows, we provide an overview
      of PARO and address link assumptions, routing policy, cost
      function and protocol operations.

2. Design Consideration

2.1 Link Assumptions

      PARO requires that radios are capable of dynamically adjusting the
      transmission power used to communicate with other nodes.
      Commercial radios including IEEE 802.11 and Bluetooth include a
      provision for power control. PARO assumes that the transmission
      power required to transmit a packet between node A and B is
      somewhat similar to the transmission power between node B and A.
      This assumption may be reasonable only if the interference/fading
      conditions in both directions are similar in space and time which
      is not always the case. Because of this constraint PARO requires



Gomez, Campbell, Naghshineh,Bisdikian     Expires September 2001[Page 5]





INTERNET-DRAFT      Power-Aware Routing Optimization    26 February 2001


      an interference-free Media Access Control (MAC) found in frequency
      band radios such as Channel Sense Multiple Access (CSMA). CSMA
      standards use collision avoidance techniques (RTS-CTS) to make
      sure only one node transmits data packets at a time, thus
      minimizing the interference caused by simultaneous transmissions.

      PARO requires source and destination nodes be located within the
      maximum transmission range of each other. This limitation suggests
      that PARO can inter-operate with traditional layer 3 ad-hoc
      routing protocols to provide energy-efficient routes in topologies
      where source and destination nodes are outside the maximum
      transmission range of each other and layer 3 packet forwarding
      becomes necessary. PARO requires that every data packet
      successfully received is acknowledged at the link layer and that
      the nodes in the network are capable of overhearing any
      transmissions by other nodes as long as the received signal to
      noise ratio (SNR) is above a certain minimum value. Any node
      should be capable of measuring the received SNR of overheard
      packets. This includes listening to any broadcast, unicast and
      control (e.g., acknowledgment) packets.

2.2 Policy

      In PARO we focus on a policy that minimizes transmission power in
      the network only. An alternative policy could attempt to balance
      the power in the network (e.g., battery level). Policies that
      minimize and balance power could be orthogonal to each other.
      Choosing a route that balances power may not minimize transmission
      power, however. As a result, inefficient use of power resources
      could take place thus limiting the availability of power reserves
      in future. While balancing the power reserves in the network is a
      desirable property of a routing protocol, we have yet to consider
      this in our work.

2.3 Cost function

      In PARO the cost of a directional link connecting node A with node
      B is defined by the minimum transmission power, Tmin(A,B), at node
      A such that the receiver at node B is still able to receive the
      packet correctly. In a network with several alternative routes
      between a given source-destination pair, the cost of each
      alternative route is the sum of the minimum transmission power of
      each link along the route. We consider transmission power only,
      thus, it neglects the cost of processing overheard packets and the
      cost of keeping the radio in a listening mode.

      PARO tries to find the route for which the aggregate transmission
      power is minimized, and furthermore, it tries to discover this
      route using as little transmission power as possible (e.g., the
      power consumed by signaling packets). PARO accommodates both
      static and mobile environments. For the case of static networks,
      once a route has been found there is no need for route maintenance
      unless some nodes are turned on or off. In a static network,
      transmitting a large amount of data traffic clearly outweighs the



Gomez, Campbell, Naghshineh,Bisdikian     Expires September 2001[Page 6]





INTERNET-DRAFT      Power-Aware Routing Optimization    26 February 2001


      cost of finding the best power-efficient route. In this case, we
      may not need to be as efficient while discovering such a route. In
      mobile environments, however, there is a need for route
      maintenance, which may outweigh the cost of data transmission in
      some cases.

3 Protocol Details

3.1 The PARO Model

      In PARO nodes operate in promiscuous mode and are capable of
      overhearing packets transmitted by other nodes as long as their
      received power is above a certain capture threshold. Prior to
      transmitting a packet, a node updates the packet's header to
      indicate the power used for its transmission. A node overhearing
      another node's transmission can then use this state information
      plus a localized measure of the received power to compute, using a
      propagation model, the minimum transmission power necessary to
      reach the transmitting node. In this simple manner nodes learn the
      minimum transmission power toward neighboring nodes. PARO does
      not, however, maintain routes to other nodes in the network in
      advance but discover routes on a per-node on-demand basis. This
      approach has the advantage that signaling packets, if any, are
      transmitted only when an unknown route to another node is required
      prior to data transmission, thus reducing the overall power
      consumption in the network.

      At first the operation of PARO may seem counter-intuitive because
      in the first iteration of PARO the source node communicates with
      the destination node directly without involving any packet
      forwarding by intermediate nodes. Any node capable of overhearing
      both source and destination nodes can compute whether packet
      forwarding can reduce the transmission power in comparison to the
      original exchange between source and destination nodes. When this
      is the case an intermediate node may send a "route-redirect"
      message to the source and destination nodes to inform them about
      the existence of a more power efficient route to communicate with
      each other. This optimization can also be applied to any pair of
      communicating nodes, thus more forwarding nodes are added to a
      route after each iteration of PARO reducing the end-to-end
      transmission power. PARO requires several iterations to converge
      toward a route that achieves the minimum transmission power.

      The PARO model includes three main algorithm modules for
      overhearing, redirecting and route-maintenance, as shown in Figure
      2. The overhearing algorithm receives packets overheard by the MAC
      and creates information about the current range of neighbor nodes.
      Overheard packets are then passed to the redirecting module which
      computes if route optimization through the intermediate node
      results in power savings. If this is the case, the redirect module
      transmits route-redirect messages to the nodes involved (e.g.,
      source and destination nodes) and creates appropriate entries in
      the redirect table. The overheard packet is then processed by the
      packet classifier module which passes the packet to the higher

INTERNET-DRAFT      Power-Aware Routing Optimization    26 February 2001


      layers if both MAC and IP addresses match, drops the packet if
      neither MAC nor IP addresses match or forwards the packet to
      another node when only the MAC address matches. In the later case,
      PARO searches the redirect table to find the next node in the
      route for the packet and then searches the overhear table to
      adjust the transmission power to reach the next node en-route.

                        Figure 2. The PARO Model

      When PARO receives a data packet from the higher layers it
      searches the redirect table to see if a route toward the
      destination node exists. If this is not the case, PARO searches
      the overhear table to see if transmission power information
      regarding the destination node is available. If this is not the
      case, PARO transmits the packet using maximum transmission power
      anticipating that the receiving node is located somewhere in the
      neighborhood. Once the destination node replies with a packet of
      its own then PARO's route optimization follows as described

      previously.

      PARO relies on data packets as the main source of routing
      information in the network. When nodes are mobile and no data
      packets are available for transmission, a source node may be
      required to transmit explicit signaling packets to maintain a
      route. The role of the route maintenance algorithm is to make sure
      a minimum flow of packets is transmitted at all in order to
      maintain the route when no data packets are available at the
      source node.

3.2  PARO Functions

      In this section, we briefly describe the overhearing, redirecting
      and route-maintenance algorithms that operate in both static and
      mobile networks.

3.2.1 Overhearing

      The overhear algorithm processes packets successfully received by
      the MAC and creates (or refreshes an entry if information
      associated with the overheard node already exists) a cache entry
      in the overhear table. This cache entry contains the triple
      [ID,time,Tmin], where the ID is a unique identifier of the
      overheard node (e.g., MAC or IP address), time is the time at
      which the overheard event occurred and Tmin is the minimum
      transmission power necessary to communicate with the overheard
      node.

      Using a propagation model that takes into account the transmitted
      power, overheard power and node sensitivity it is possible to
      compute the minimum transmission power Tmin between the
      transmitting and overhearing nodes. Because of fading and other
      channel impairments it is not recommended to compute the minimum
      transmission power using one overheard packet only. A better
      approximation is to take a moving worst-case approach, where the
      overhear node buffers up to M previous measurements of the minimum
      transmission power and then chooses the one with the highest
      value.

      Any node transmitting a packet to the next hop in the route has to
      determine the next hop's current range, which may be different
      from its last recorded position. Clearly, the preferable
      transmission estimate is the one that transmits a packet using
      minimum transmission range. In PARO, we address this issue by
      transmitting a packet with an extra "delta" transmission range
      than previously recorded, thus increasing the probability of
      reaching the next hop node with the first attempt. Thus delta
      represents how much the transmitting node over estimates the
      transmission range of the next node en-route. The value of delta
      depends on the average speed of nodes and the time interval
      between the last time the next node en-route was overheard and the
      current time; we refer to this interval as the "silence-interval".
      The longer the silence-interval the greater the uncertainty about

INTERNET-DRAFT      Power-Aware Routing Optimization    26 February 2001


      the current range of the next node en route and therefore the
      larger the value of delta. We resolve this problem by requiring
      source nodes to transmit route-maintenance packets toward
      destination nodes whenever no data packets are available for
      transmission for a specific interval called route-timeout.
      Transmission of route-maintenance messages only occur whenever a
      node that is actively communicating with another node stops
      transmitting data messages for a route-timeout interval. The
      transmission of route-maintenance messages put an upper bound on
      the silence-interval, thus, an upper bound on delta. The route
      maintenance message contains no extra information beyond the
      destination node and transmission power fields, thus it adds
      little overhead.


3.2.2 Redirecting

      The redirect algorithm is responsible for performing the route
      optimization that leads toward discovering routes requiring less
      transmission power. This module performs two basic operations:
      compute-redirect, which computes whether a route optimization
      between two nodes is feasible; and transmit-redirect, which
      determines when to transmit route-redirect messages.



                                                   B
                                               * O
                           Tmin(A,B)     *      *
                                   *          *
                             *              *  Tmin(C,B)
                        *                 *
                   *                    *
              O * * * * * * * * * * *  O
              A         Tmin(A,C)       C

3.2.2.1 Compute Redirect

      Figure 3 illustrates how compute-redirect operates. In this
      example nodes A, B and C are located within maximum transmission
      range from each other and, initially, node A is communicates
      directly with node B. Because node C is capable of overhearing
      packets from both A and B nodes, it can compute whether the new
      route A<->C<->B has a lower transmission power than the original
      route A<->B. More precisely, node C computes that a route
      optimization between nodes A and B is feasible if:

          Tmin(A,B) > alpha (Tmin(C,A) + Tmin(C,B))    [1]

      Similarly, we define the optimization percentage of adding a node



Gomez, Campbell, Naghshineh,Bisdikian     Expires September 2001[Page 10]





INTERNET-DRAFT      Power-Aware Routing Optimization    26 February 2001


      between two other nodes in a route, Opt, as:

          Opt = (Tmin(C,A) + Tmin(C,B)) / (Tmin(A,B)   [2]

      The factor alpha in Equation 1 above, restricts the area between
      two nodes where a potential forwarding node is allowed to transmit
      route-redirect messages. For networks where nodes are static and
      saving battery power is important (e.g., a sensor network) alpha
      can be set around 1.1-1.2, meaning that even a small improvement
      in transmission power is worth the drawback of adding an extra
      node (e.g., hop) to the route. Once a node computes that route
      optimization is feasible, it creates an entry in its redirect
      table. Because of mobility, a forwarding node may move to a
      location where it no longer helps to optimize the transmission
      power between two nodes. In this case, it is necessary to remove
      such a node from the path using another route-redirect message.

3.2.2.2 Transmit Redirect

      In PARO, several nodes may simultaneously attempt to transmit
      route-redirect messages to one node. Because only one intermediate
      node between two nodes is added at a time, any route-redirect
      message except the one transmitted by the node computing the
      lowest Opt percentage represents wasted bandwidth and power
      resources. For sparsely populated networks, this may not be a
      problem. However, this is clearly an issue for densely populated
      networks where several route-redirect messages would be
      anticipated. The transmit-redirect procedure addresses this issue
      by giving priority to transmit a route-redirect message to
      intermediate nodes computing lower route optimization values
      first. In this manner, a potential forwarding node overhearing a
      route-redirect advertisement from another node offering a route-
      redirect with a lower Opt value would refrain from transmitting
      its own route-redirect request

      There are several ways to give preferential access to certain
      messages in a distributed manner. We used a simple approach which
      consists of applying a different time-window before transmitting
      the route-redirect message after the triggering event takes place
      (e.g., the lower the Opt value computed, the shorter the
      intermediate node waits to transmit its route-redirect request).
      The actual lower and upper bound of the waiting interval are set
      such that they do not interfere with predefined timers used by the
      MAC protocol, making these bounds MAC dependent.

      In the unlikely scenario that more than one route-redirect request
      is transmitted, the target node will choose the one providing a
      lower Opt value. After receiving a route-redirect message, a node
      modifies its own redirect-table putting the source of the redirect
      message as the next hop in the route for the specific source-
      destination route.

3.2.3 Route-Maintenance

      In static networks no route maintenance is required once the
      initial route between source and destinations nodes has been found
      other than when nodes are turned on or off. PARO relies on data
      packets as the main source of routing information. In the case of
      mobile nodes, data traffic alone may not be sufficient to maintain
      routes. Consider the extreme case of a source node transmitting
      packets once every second to a destination where every node moves
      at 10 meters/second on average. In this example information about
      the range of the next node en route would be outdated as a basis
      for the transmission of the next packet. Depending on node density
      and mobility there is a need to maintain a minimum rate of packets
      between source and destination pairs in order to discover and
      maintain routes as forwarding nodes move in and out of existing
      routes. In PARO a source node transmits route-maintenance packets
      when there are no data packets available to be sent within a
      route-timeout interval.

4 Security Considerations

      Currently, PARO does not specify any special security measures.
      This internet-draft assumes that all nodes participating in the
      PARO protocol do so without malicious intent to modify or corrupt
      packet information as well as the ability of the network to route
      packets. Nodes participating in PARO benefit from the relay
      capability of other nodes that motivates their participation in
      the protocol. Encryption techniques can be used in the air
      interface to prevent attack by outsiders.
