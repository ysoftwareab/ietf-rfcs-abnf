  Security Implications of the Use of IPv6 Extension Headers with IPv6
                           Neighbor Discovery
                draft-gont-6man-nd-extension-headers-01

Abstract

   IPv6 Extension Headers with Neighbor Discovery messages can be
   leveraged to circumvent simple local network protections, such as
   "Router Advertisement Guard".  Since there is no legitimate use for
   IPv6 Extension Headers in Neighbor Discovery messages, and such use
   greatly complicates network monitoring and simple security
   mitigations such as RA-Guard, this document proposes that hosts
   silently ignore Neighbor Discovery messages that use IPv6 Extension
   Headers.

1.  Introduction

   IPv6 Router Advertisement Guard (RA-Guard) is a mitigation technique
   for attack vectors based on ICMPv6 Router Advertisement messages.
   [RFC6104] describes the problem statement of "Rogue IPv6 Router
   Advertisements", and [RFC6105] specifies the "IPv6 Router
   Advertisement Guard" functionality.

   [I-D.gont-v6ops-ra-guard-evasion] describes how IPv6 Extension
   Headers can be leveraged to circumvent the RA-Guard protection.
   Additionally, the use of Extension Headers (and of the Fragmentation
   Header in particularly) greatly increases the difficulty to monitor
   Neighbor Discovery traffic (e.g., with tools such as NDPMon
   [NDPMon]).

   Since there is no current legitimate use for IPv6 Extension Headers
   in IPv6 Neighbor Discovery packets, and avoiding their use in such
   packets would greatly simplify the monitoring and mitigation of
   Neighbor Discovery attacks, this document proposes that hosts
   silently ignore Neighbor Discovery messages that employ IPv6
   Extension Headers.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Specification

   Hosts SHOULD silently ignore Neighbor Discovery messages (Neighbor
   Solicitation, Neighbor Advertisement, Router Solcicitation, and
   Router Advertisement messages) that employ IPv6 Extension Headers.

3.  Security Considerations

   IPv6 Extension Headers can be leveraged to circumvent network
   monitoring and mechanisms such as RA-Guard
   [I-D.gont-v6ops-ra-guard-evasion].  By updating the relevant
   specifications such that IPv6 Extension Headers are not allowed in
   Neighbor Discovery messages, protection of local network against
   Neighbor Discovery attacks, and monitoring of Neighbor Discovery
   traffic is greatly simplified.

   [I-D.gont-v6ops-ra-guard-evasion] discusses an improvement to the RA-
   Guard mechanism that can mitigate Neighbor Discovery attacks that
   employ IPv6 Extension Headers.  However, it should be noted that
   unless [RFC4861] is updated (as proposed in this document) such that
   use of IPv6 extension headers is not allowed with Neighbor Discovery
   messages, monitoring of Neighbor Discovery traffic and mitigation of
   Neighbor Discovery vulnerabilities will probably imply increased
   complexity and/or reduced performance in the corresponding devices
   (RA-Guard box, Network Intrusion Detection Systems, etc.).

A.1.  Changes from draft-gont-6man-nd-extension-headers-00

   o  The Security Considerations section now notes that unless IPv6
      extension headers are not allowed with Neighbor Discovery
      messages, monitoring ND traffic and/or mitigating ND
      vulnerabilities might result in increased complexity and/or
      reduced performance.
