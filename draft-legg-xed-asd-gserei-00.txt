1.  Introduction

   Abstract Syntax Notation X (ASN.X) [ASN.X] is primarily an Extensible
   Markup Language (XML) [XML] representation for Abstract Syntax
   Notation One (ASN.1) [X.680] specifications.  The ASN.X
   representation for the ASN.1 basic notation [X.680] [X.680-1] is
   described elsewhere [ASN.X].

   The grammar of ASN.1 also permits the application of encoding
   instructions [X.680-1], through type prefixes and encoding control
   sections, that modify how abstract values are encoded by nominated
   encoding rules.

   The generic notation for type prefixes and encoding control sections
   is defined by the ASN.1 basic notation, however the notation for
   specific encoding instructions i.e., the
   EncodingInstructionAssignmentList and EncodingInstruction productions
   of the notation, are defined separately for each set of encoding
   rules using encoding instructions.  This document specifies the ASN.X
   representation for EncodingInstructionAssignmentList and
   EncodingInstruction as they are defined for the Generic String
   Encoding Rules (GSER) [GSER][GSEREI].

   ASN.X is defined in terms of rules for translating from an ASN.1
   specification.  This does not preclude an ASN.X document being
   written directly without a pre-existing ASN.1 specification, however
   such an ASN.X document is considered valid if and only if there
   exists in principle an ASN.1 specification which when translated
   would yield the ASN.X document.

   By design, an ASN.X document is also the Robust XML Encoding Rules
   (RXER) [RXER] encoding of an ASN.1 abstract value.  The ASN.1 type
   definitions for such abstract values, insofar as they pertain to the

   ASN.1 basic notation, are provided elsewhere [ASN.X], however this
   document provides the ASN.1 type definitions for representing GSER
   encoding instructions as abstract values.  These definitions appear
   in Appendix A.

   The ASN.X translation of the ASN.1 module in Appendix A is presented
   in Appendix B.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED" and "MAY" in this document are
   to be interpreted as described in, BCP 14, RFC 2119 [BCP14].  The key
   word "OPTIONAL" is exclusively used with its ASN.1 meaning.

   A reference to an ASN.1 production [X.680] (e.g., Type, NamedType) is
   a reference to the text in an ASN.1 specification corresponding to
   that production.

   The description of the translation of GSER encoding instructions into
   ASN.X makes use of definitions from the XML Information Set (Infoset)
   [ISET].  In particular, information item property names are presented
   per the Infoset, e.g., [local name].  In the sections that follow,
   the term "element" shall be taken to mean an Infoset element
   information item and "attribute" shall be taken to mean an Infoset
   attribute information item.

   The [namespace name] of any element or attribute generated by the
   translation from an ASN.1 specification has no value unless specified
   otherwise.

3.  EncodingInstructionAssignmentList Translation

   As described in the specification for ASN.X [ASN.X], the translation
   of an EncodingControlSection for GSER is an element with the
   [local name] "encodingControl-GSER".  The translation of the
   EncodingInstructionAssignmentList in such an EncodingControlSection
   determines the content of the <encodingControl-GSER> element.

   The EncodingInstructionAssignmentList for GSER is currently defined
   to be empty [GSEREI] therefore the [attributes] and [children] of the
   <encodingControl-GSER> element are both empty.

4.  EncodingInstruction Translation

   The translation of an EncodingInstruction for GSER can appear in an
   EncodingPrefix.  The translation for an EncodingPrefix is described
   by the specification for ASN.X.

INTERNET-DRAFT      ASN.X: GSER Encoding Instructions       July 6, 2005


   The translation of an EncodingInstruction for GSER is the translation
   of the contained ChoiceOfStringsInstruction (the only defined
   encoding instruction for GSER).

4.1.  ChoiceOfStringsInstruction Translation

   The translation of a ChoiceOfStringsInstruction is an element with
   the [local name] "choiceOfStrings".

   If the ChoiceOfStringsInstruction has a PrecedenceList then an
   attribute with the [local name] "precedence" SHALL be added to the
   [attributes] of the <choiceOfStrings> element.  The
   [normalized value] of this attribute is the white space separated
   list of the RXER encodings [RXER] of the effective names [RXEREI] of
   the NamedType instances corresponding to the identifiers in the
   PrecedenceList.

   Example

      [GSER:CHOICE-OF-STRINGS PRECEDENCE utf8 visible] CHOICE {
          visible  [RXER:NAME AS "ascii"] VisibleString,
          utf8     UTF8String
      }

      <type xmlns:asn1="http://xmled.info/ns/ASN.1">
       <prefixed>
        <GSER><choiceOfStrings precedence="utf8 ascii"/></GSER>
        <type>
         <choice>
          <element name="ascii" identifier="visible"
                   type="asn1:VisibleString"/>
          <element name="utf8" type="asn1:UTF8String"/>
         </choice>
        </type>
       </prefixed>
      </type>

5.  Security Considerations

   The ASN.X translation of a GSER encoding instruction is semantically
   equivalent to the original GSER encoding instruction.  The security
   considerations that apply to an application built from an original
   ASN.1 specification with GSER encoding instructions apply equally to
   an application built from the ASN.X translation of the ASN.1
   specification.

6.  IANA Considerations
