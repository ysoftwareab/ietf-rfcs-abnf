1. Introduction 
    
    
   This draft describes the basic mode of Layer 1 VPNs (L1VPN BM) that 
   outlined in [L1VPN-Framework]. In this document, we consider a 
   service provider network that consists of devices that support GMPLS 
   (e.g., Lambda Switch Capable devices, Optical Cross Connects, SDH 
   Cross Connects, etc.). We partition these devices into P (provider) 
   and PE (provider edge) devices. In the context of this document we 
   will refer to the former devices as just "P", and to the latter 
   devices as just "PE". The Ps are connected only to the devices 
   within the provider's network. The PEs are connected to the other 
   devices within the network (either Ps, or PEs), as well as to the 
   devices outside of the services provider network. We'll refer to 
   such other devices as Client Edge (CE) devices. An example of a CE 
   would be a GMPLS-enabled device that is either a router, an SDH 
   cross-connect, or an Ethernet switch. 
    
   The [GMPLS-OVERLAY] draft is the basis for signaling from the CE to 
   the PE. In the [GMPLS-OVERLAY] draft the terms Core Node (CN) and 
   Edge Node (EN) correspond to PE and CE respectively.

   Figure 1: Generalized Layer 1 VPN Reference Model 
    
   This draft specifies how the L1VPN Basic Mode (BM) service can be 
   realized using provisioning or VPN auto-discovery, Generalized 
   Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling [GMPLS-RSVP-TE], 
   Routing [GMPLS-Routing] and LMP [GMPLS-LMP] mechanisms.  
    
   The L1VPN auto-discovery has similar requirements to the L3VPNs 
   auto-discovery [L3VPN-REQ]. As with L3VPNs there are protocol 
   options to be made with auto-discovery. Section 4.1.1 deals with the 
   information need to be discovered. GMPLS routing and signaling are

Internet Draft  draft-fedyk-l1vpn-basic-mode-01.txt     Mar. 2006 
 
   used without extensions within the services provider network to 
   establish and maintain Lambda Switch Capable (LSC) or SONET/SDH 
   (TDM) connections between service provider nodes. This follows the 
   model in [GMPLS-Overlay].  
    
   In L1VPN BM, the use of LMP facilitates the population of the 
   services provider port information tables. Indeed, LMP may be used 
   as an option to automate local CE-PE link discovery. LMP also may 
   augment routing in extended mode as well as failure handling 
   capabilities.  
 
2. Layer 1 VPN Services 
    
   Layer 1 services on the interfaces of customer and services provider 
   ports could be any of the L1 interfaces supported by GMPLS. Since 
   the mechanisms specified here use GMPLS as the signaling mechanism, 
   and since GMPLS applies to both SONET/SDH (TDM) and Lambda Switch 
   Capable (LSC) interfaces, it results that L1VPN services includes 
   but is not restricted to Lambda Switch Capable or TDM based 
   equipment. Note that this document describes Basic Mode L1 VPNs and 
   as such assumes that  
   (1) GMPLS RSVP-TE is used for signaling both within the service 
   provider (between PEs), as well as between the customer and the 
   service provider (between CE and PE);  
   (2) GMPLS Routing on the CE-PE link is outside the scope of the 
   basic mode of operation of L1VPN see [L1VPN-Framework].  
    
   A CE is connected to a PE via one or more links. In the context of 
   this document a link is a GMPLS Traffic Engineering (TE) link 
   construct, as defined in [GMPLS-ROUTING]. In the context of this 
   document, a TE link is a logical construct that is a member of a VPN 
   hence introducing the notion of membership to a set of CEs forming 
   the VPN. Interfaces at the end of each link are limited to type LSC 
   or TDM interfaces that are supported by GMPLS. More specifically a 
   [CE,PE] link must be of the type [X,LSC] or [Y,TDM] where X = PSC, 
   L2SC, or TDM and Y = PSC or L2SC, in case the LSP is not terminated 
   by the CE, X may also = LSC and Y = TDM (the latter case is outside 
   the scope of this document). Likewise, PEs could be any L1 devices 
   that are supported by GMPLS (e.g., optical cross connects, SDH 
   cross-connects), while CEs may be devices at layers 1, 2 and 3 such 
   as an SDH cross-connect, an Ethernet switch, and a router 
   respectively). 
    
   Each TE link may consist of one or more channels or sub-channels 
   (e.g., wavelength or wavelength and timeslot respectively). For the 
   purpose of this discussion we assume that all the channels within a 
   given link have similar shared characteristics (e.g., switching 
   capability, encoding, type, etc_), and can be selected independently 
   from the CE's point of view. Channels on different links of a CE 
   need not have the same characteristics.

Internet Draft  draft-fedyk-l1vpn-basic-mode-01.txt     Mar. 2006 
 
   There may be more than one TE link between a given CE-PE pair. A CE 
   may be connected to more than one PE (with at least one port per 
   each PE). And, conversely, a PE may have more than one CE from 
   different VPNs connected to it.  
    
   If a CE is connected to a PE via multiple TE links and all the links 
   belong to the same VPN, for the purpose of this document,  these 
   links (referred to as component links) MAY  be treated as a single 
   TE link using the link bundling constructs [LINK-BUNDLING]. 
 
   A link may have only data bearing channels, or only control bearing 
   channels, or both.  For the purpose of this discussion it is 
   required that for a given CE-PE pair at least one of the links 
   between them has at least one data bearing channel, and at least one 
   control bearing channel, or there is IP reachability between the CE 
   and the PE that could be used to exchange control information.  
 
   A point-to-point link has two end-points - one on the CE and one on 
   the PE. In the context of this document we'll refer to the former as 
   "CE port", and to the latter as "PE port". From the above it follows 
   that a CE is connected to a PE via one or more ports, where each 
   port may consist of one or more channels or sub-channels (e.g., 
   wavelength or wavelength and timeslot respectively), and all the 
   channels within a given port have shared similar characteristics and 
   can be interchanged from the CE's point of view. Similar to the 
   definition of a TE link, in the context of this document, ports are 
   logical constructs that are used to represent a grouping of physical 
   resources that are used to connect a CE to a PE on a per L1VPN 
   basis.  
    
   At any point in time, a given port on a PE is associated with at 
   most one L1VPN, or to be more precise with at most one Port 
   Information Table maintained by the PE (although different ports on 
   a given PE could be associated with different L1VPNs, or to be more 
   precise with different Port Information Tables). The association of 
   a port with a VPN may be defined by provisioning the relationship on 
   the services provider devices. In other words the context of a VPN 
   membership in Basic mode is enforced through service provider 
   control.  
    
   This document assumes that the interface between the CE and PE used 
   for the purpose of signaling is capable of initiating/processing 
   GMPLS protocol messages [GMPLS-RSVP-TE] and follows the procedures 
   described in [GMPLS-OVERLAY]. 
    
   An important goal of L1VPN services is the ability to support what 
   is known as "single ended provisioning", where the addition of a new 
   port to a given L1VPN  involves configuration changes only on the PE 
   that has this port.  The extension of this model to the CE is 
   outside the scope of the L1VPN BM.   
    
   Another important goal in the L1VPN service is the ability to 
   establish/terminate an LSP between a pair of (existing) ports within 
Fedyk & Rekhter.                                          [Page 5] 
 

 
Internet Draft  draft-fedyk-l1vpn-basic-mode-01.txt     Mar. 2006 
 
   a L1VPN from the CE devices without involving configuration changes 
   in any of the services provider's devices. In other words, the VPN 
   topology is under the CE device control (provided that the 
   underlying PE-PE connectivity is provided and allowed by the 
   network).  
    
   The mechanisms outlined in this document aim at achieving these 
   above goals. Specifically, as part of the L1VPN service offering, 
   these mechanisms (1) enable the service provider to restrict the set 
   of ports to which a given port could be connected, (2) enable a CE to 
   establish the actual LSP to a subset of ports. Finally, the 
   mechanisms allow arbitrary L1VPN topologies to be supported ranging 
   from hub-and-spoke to full mesh point to point connections. Other 
   more advanced service and topology support such as point to multi 
   point (P2MP) services etc. is for further study. 
 
   The L1VPN BM mode does not specify the exchange of CE routing or 
   topology information to the services provider.  
    
3. Addressing, Ports, Links and Control Channels 
    
   GMPLS established conventions for Addressing and link numbering are 
   discussed in the [GMPLS-Arch] documents.  This section builds on 
   those definitions for the L1VPN case where we now have Customer and 
   services provider addresses in a Layer 1 Context.  
    
3.1 Service Provider Realm 
    
   This document assumes that a service provider, or a group of service 
   providers that collectively offer L1VPN service, have a single 
   addressing realm that spans all PE devices involved in providing the 
   L1VPN service. This is necessary to enable GMPLS mechanisms for path 
   establishment and maintenance. We will refer to this realm as the 
   service provider addressing realm. This document further assumes 
   that each L1VPN customer has its own addressing realm. We will refer 
   to such realms as the customer addressing realms. Customer 
   addressing realms may overlap with each other, and may also overlap 
   with the service provider addressing realm. 
    
3.2 Layer 1 Ports and Index 
 
   Within a given L1VPN, each port on a CE that connects the CE to a PE 
   has an identifier that is unique within that L1VPN (but need not be 
   unique across several L1VPNs). One way to construct such an 
   identifier is to assign each port an address that is unique within a 
   given L1VPN, and use this address as a port identifier. Another way 
   to construct such an identifier is to assign each port on a CE an 
   index that is unique within that CE, assign each CE an address that 
   is unique within a given L1VPN, and then use a tuple <port index, CE 
   address> as a port identifier. Note that both the port and the CE 
   address may be an address in several formats.  This includes, but is 
   not limited to IPv4, and IPv6. This identifier is part of the 
   Customer Addressing Realm and is used by the CE device to identify

Internet Draft  draft-fedyk-l1vpn-basic-mode-01.txt     Mar. 2006 
 
   the CE port and the CE remote port for signaling.  CEs do not know 
   or understand the services provider Realm addresses.   
 
   Within a service provider network, each port on a PE that connects 
   that PE to a CE has an identifier that is unique within that 
   network. One way to construct such an identifier is to assign each 
   port on a PE an index that is unique within that PE, assign each PE 
   an IP address that is unique within the service provider addressing 
   realm, and then use a tuple <port index, PE IPv4 address> or <port 
   index, PE IPv6 address> as a port identifier within the services 
   provider network. Another way to construct such an identifier is to 
   assign an IPv4 or IPv6 address that is unique within the service 
   provider addressing realm to each such port. Either way, this IPv4 
   or IPv6 address is internal to the service provider network and is 
   used for GMPLS signaling within the service provider network. 
 
   As a result, each link connecting the CE to the PE is associated 
   with a CE port that has a unique identifier within a given L1VPN, 
   and with a PE port that has a unique identifier within the service 
   provider network. We'll refer to the former as the Customer Port 
   Identifier (CPI), and to the latter as the Provider Port Identifier 
   (PPI). 
    
3.3 Port and Index Mapping 
 
   This document assumes that each PE port that has a PPI also has an 
   identifier that is unique within the L1VPN customer addressing realm 
   of the L1VPN associated with that port.  One way to construct such 
   an identifier is to assign each port an address that is unique 
   within a given L1VPN customer addressing realm, and use this address 
   as a port identifier. Another way to construct such an identifier is 
   to assign each port an index that is unique within a given PE, 
   assign each PE an IP address that is unique within a given L1VPN 
   customer addressing realm (but need not be unique within the service 
   provider network), and then use a tuple <port index, PE IP address> 
   that acts as a port identifier.  We'll refer to such port identifier 
   as the VPN-PPI.  
    
   For L1VPNs it is a requirement that services provider operations are 
   independent of the VPN customer's addressing realm and the services 
   provider addressing realm is hidden from the customer. To achieve 
   this we have created two identifiers at the PE, one customer facing 
   and the other services provider facing. The PE IP address used for 
   the VPN-PPI is independent of the PE IP address used for the PPI (as 
   the two are taken from different address realms, the former from the 
   services provider's addressing realm and the latter from a VPN 
   customer's addressing realm). If for a given port on a PE, the PPI 
   and the VPN-PPI port identifiers are unnumbered, then they both 
   could use exactly the same port index. This is a mere convenience 
   since the PPI and VPN_PPI can be in any combination of valid 
   formats.

             Figure 2: Customer/Provider Port/Index Mapping 
    
   Note, as stated earlier, that IP addresses used for the CPIs, PPIs 
   and VPN-PPIs could be either IPv4, or IPv6 format addresses.  
     
   For a given link connecting a CE to a PE, if the CPI is an IPv4/IPv6 
   address, then the VPN-PPI has to be an IPv4/IPv6 address as well. 
   And if the CPI is a <port index, CPI IPv4/IPv6 address>, then the 
   VPN-PPI must be a <port index, PE IPv4/IPv6 address>. However, for a 
   given port on PE, whether the VPN-PPI of that port is an IP address 
   or a <port index, PE IPv4/IPv6 address> is independent of whether 
   the PPI of that port is an IP address or a <port index, PE IPv4/IPv6 
   address>. 
    
   This document assumes that assignment of the PPIs is controlled 
   solely by the service provider (without any coordination with the 
   L1VPN customers), while assignment of addresses used by the CPIs and 
   VPN-PPIs is controlled solely by the administrators of L1VPN. The 
   L1VPN administrator is the entity that controls the L1VPN service 
   specifics for the L1VPN customers. This function may be owned by the 
   service provider but may also be performed by a third party who has 
   agreements with the service provider. And, of course, each L1VPN 
   could assign such addresses on its own, without any coordination 
   with other L1VPNs.  
    
   This document also assumes that there is an IP control channel 
   between the CE and the PE. This channel could be either a single IP 
   hop, or a tunnel (GRE or IP-in-IP) or an IP private network, or even 
   an IP VPN for example. We'll refer to the CE's address of this 
   channel as the CE Control Channel Address (CE-CC-Addr), and to the 
   PE's address of this channel as the PE Control Channel Address (PE-
   CC-Addr). Both CE-CC-Addr and PE-CC-Addr are required to be unique 
   within the L1VPN they belong to, but are not required to be unique 
   across multiple L1VPNs. Control channel addresses are not shared 
   amongst multiple VPNs. Assignment of CE-CC-Addr and PE-CC-Addr is 
   controlled by the administrators of the L1VPN. 
    
   Multiple ports on a CE could share the same control channel only as 
   long as all these ports belong to the same L1VPN. Likewise, multiple 
   ports on a PE could share the same control channel only as long as 
   all these ports belong to the same L1VPN.

4. Port Based L1VPN Basic Mode 
    
   An L1VPN is a port-based VPN service where a pair of CEs could be 
   connected through the service provider network via a GMPLS-based LSP 
   within a given VPN port topology. It is precisely this LSP that 
   forms the basic unit of the L1VPN service that the service provider 
   network offers. If a port by which a CE is connected to a PE 
   consists of multiple channels (e.g., multiple wavelengths), the CE 
   could establish LSPs to multiple other CEs in the same VPN over this 
   single port. 
 
   In the L1VPN, the service provider does not initiate the creation of 
   an LSP between a pair of PE ports. This is done rather by the CEs, 
   which attach to the ports. However, the SP, by using the 
   mechanisms/toolkit outlined in this document, restricts the set of 
   other PE ports, which may be the remote endpoints of LSPs that have 
   the given port as the local endpoint. Subject to these restrictions, 
   the CE-to-CE connectivity is under the control of the CEs 
   themselves. In other words, the SP allows a L1VPN to have a certain 
   set of topologies (expressed as a port-to-port connectivity matrix; 
   CE-initiated signaling is used to choose a particular topology from 
   that set. 
    
   For each L1VPN that has at least one port on a given PE, the PE 
   maintains a Port Information Table (PIT) associated with that L1VPN. 
   A PIT contains a list of <CPI, PPI> tuples for all the ports within 
   its L1VPN. In addition, for local PE ports of a given L1VPN the 
   tuples also include the VPN-PPIs of these ports.

4.1 L1VPN Port Information Tables 
    
    
   A PIT consists of local information as well as remote information. 
   It follows that PIT on a given PE is populated from two information 
   sources:  
    
     1. The information related to the CEs' ports attached to the ports 
        local to that PE.  
     2. The information about the CEs connected to the remote PEs 
    
   A PIT may be populated via provisioning or by auto-discovery 
   procedures. When provisioning is used the entire table may be 
   populated by provisioning commands either at a console or by a 
   management system which may have some automation capability.  
   As the network grows some form of automation is desirable.  
    
   For local information between a CE and a PE, a PE may leverage LMP 
   to populate the <CPI, VPN-PPI> link information. This local 
   information also needs to be propagated to other PEs that share the 
   same VPN. The mechanisms for this are out of scope for this document 
   but the information needed to be exchanged is described in section 
   4.1.1.  
    
   The PIT is by nature VPN-specific in that entries for a L1VPN are 
   only required on a PE if that PE locally supports that L1VPN by 
   having CEs belonging to that VPN attached to the PE. However, the 
   full set of PITs with all L1VPN entries for multiple VPNs may also 
   be available to all PEs. 
    
   The remote information in the context of a VPN identifier ie the 
   remote CEs of this VPN could also be sent to the local CE belonging 
   to the same VPN. Exchange of this information is outside the scope 
   of this document.  
    
4.1.1. Local Auto-Discovery Information 
 
   The information that needs to be discovered on a PE local port is 
   the remote CPI and the VPN-PPI.  In many cases if LMP is used 
   between the CE and PE, LMP can exchange this information. Other 
   mechanism may also be used but discussion of these mechanisms is 
   outside the scope of this document. 
    
   Once a CPI has been discovered, the corresponding VPN-PPI maps in a 
   local context to a VPN Identifier and a corresponding PPI. 
   One way to enforce a provider controlled VPN context is to pre-
   provision VPN-PPI's with a VPN identifier. Other policy mechanisms 
   to achieve this are outside the scope of this document.  In this 
   manner, a relationship of a CPI to a VPN and PPI port can be 
   established when the port is provisioned as belonging to the VPN.

4.1.2. PE Remote Auto-Discovery Information 
 
    
   This section provides the information that is carried by any auto-
   discovery mechanism, and is used to dynamically populate a PIT. The 
   information provides a single <CPI, PPI> mapping.  Each auto-
   discovery mechanism will define the method(s) by which multiple 
   <CPI, PPI> mappings are communicated, as well as invalidated. 
    
   The encoding of the auto-discovery information uses BGP address 
   family identifiers (AFIs), and defines a new AFI for L1VPN (to be 
   assigned by the IANA). This information should be consistent 
   regardless of the mechanism use to distribute the information. 
   [L1VPN-BGP-AD], [L1VPN-OSPF-AD].  
    
   The format of encoding a single <PPI, CPI> tuple is: 
    
        +---------------------------------------+ 
        |     Length (1 octet)                  | 
        +---------------------------------------+ 
        |     PPI Length (1 octet)              | 
        +---------------------------------------+ 
        |     PPI (variable)                    | 
        +---------------------------------------+ 
        |     CPI AFI (2 octets)                | 
        +---------------------------------------+ 
        |     CPI (length)                      | 
        +---------------------------------------+ 
        |     CPI (variable)                    | 
        +---------------------------------------+ 
    
        Figure 4: Auto-Discovery Information 
    
   The use and meaning of these fields are as follows: 
    
   Length: 
    
      A one octet field whose value indicates the length of the  <PPI, 
      CPI> Information tuple in octets. 
    
   PPI Length: 
    
      A one octet field whose value indicates the length of the PPI 
      field 
    
   PPI field: 
    
      A variable length field that contains the value of the PPI 
      (either an address or <port index, address> tuple

   CPI AFI field: 
    
      A two octets field whose value indicates address family of the 
      CPI. 
    
   CPI Length: 
    
      A once octet field whose value indicates the length of the CPI 
      field. 
    
   CPI (variable): 
    
      A variable length field that contains the CPI value (either an 
      address or <port index, address> tuple. 
    
    
   <PPI, CPI> tuples must also be associated with one or more globally 
   unique identifiers associated with a particular VPN.  A globally 
   unique identifier can encode a VPN-ID, a route target, or any other 
   globally unique identifier. In this document we specify a generic 
   encoding format for the globally unique identifier common to all the 
   auto-discovery mechanisms. However, each auto-discovery mechanism 
   will define the specific method(s) by which the encoding is 
   distributed and the association with a <PPI, CPI> tuple is made.  
   The encoding of the globally unique identifier associated with the 
   VPN is:

4.2 CE to CE LSP Establishment 
    
   In order to establish an LSP, a CE needs to identify all other CEs 
   in the CE's L1VPN it wants to connect to. A CE may already have 
   obtained this information through provisioning or through some other 
   schemes (such schemes are outside the scope of this document). 
    
   Ports associated with a given CE-PE link, in addition to their CPI 
   and PPI may also have other information associated with them that 
   describes characteristics and constraints of the channels within 
   these ports, such as encoding supported by the channels, bandwidth 
   of a channel, total unreserved bandwidth within the port, etc. This 
   information could be further augmented with the information about 
   certain capabilities of the services provider network (e.g., support 
   RSOH DCC transparency, arbitrary concatenation, etc.). This 
   information is used to ensure that ports at each end of an LSP have 
   compatible characteristics, and that there are sufficient 
   unallocated resources to establish an LSP between these ports.

   It may happen that for a given pair of ports within an L1VPN, each 
   of the CEs connected to these ports would concurrently try to 
   establish an LSP to the other CE. If having a pair of LSPs between a 
   pair of ports is viewed as undesirable, the way to resolve this is 
   to require the CE with the lower value of the CPI to terminate the 
   LSP originated by the CE. This option could be controlled by 
   configuration on the CE devices. 
 
4.3 Signaling  
    
   In L1VPN BM a CE needs to be configured with the CPIs of other 
   ports. Once a CE is configured with the CPIs of the other ports 
   within the same L1VPN, which we'll refer to as "target ports", the 
   CE uses a (subset of) GMPLS signaling, to request the provider 
   network to establish an LSP to a target port.  
    
   For inter-CE connectivity, the request originated by the CE contains 
   the CPI of the port on the CE that CE wants to use for the LSP, and 
   the CPI of the target port. When the PE attached to the CE that 
   originated the request receives the request, the PE identifies the 
   appropriate PIT, and then uses the information in that PIT to find 
   out the PPI associated with the CPI of the target port carried in 
   the request. The PPI should be sufficient for the PE to establish an 
   LSP. Ultimately the request reaches the CE associated with the 
   target CPI (note that the request still carries the CPI of the CE 
   that originated the request). If the CE associated with the target 
   CPI accepts the request, the LSP is established.  
    
   Note that a CE need not establish an LSP to every target port that 
   CE knows about - it is a local CE matter to select a subset of 
   target ports to which the CE will try to establish LSPs. 
     
   The procedures for establishing an individual connection between two 
   corresponding CEs is the same as the procedure specified for GMPLS 
   overlay [GMPLS-OVERLAY]. 
     
4.3.1 Signaling Procedures 
 
   When an ingress CE sends an RSVP Path message to an ingress PE, the 
   source IP address in the IP packet that carries the message is set 
   to the appropriate CE-CC-Addr, and the destination IP address in the 
   packet is set to the appropriate PE-CC-Addr. When the ingress PE 
   sends back to the ingress CE the corresponding Resv message, the 
   source IP address in the IP packet that carries the message is set 
   to the PE-CC-Addr, and the destination IP address is set to the CE-
   CC-Addr. 
    
   Likewise, when an egress PE sends an RSVP Path message to an egress 
   CE, the source IP address in the IP packet that carries the message 
   is set to the appropriate PE-CC-Addr, and the destination IP address 
   in the packet is set to the appropriate CE-CC-Addr. When the egress 
   CE sends back to the egress PE the corresponding Resv message, the 
   source IP address in the IP packet that carries the message is set 
Fedyk & Rekhter.                                         [Page 13] 
 

 
Internet Draft  draft-fedyk-l1vpn-basic-mode-01.txt     Mar. 2006 
 
   to the CE-CC-Addr, and the destination IP address is set to the PE-
   CC-Addr. 
    
   In addition to being used for IP addresses in the IP packet that 
   carries RSVP messages between CE and PE, CE-CC-Addr and PE-CC-Addr 
   are also used in the Next/Previous Hop Address field of the IF_ID 
   RSVP_HOP object that is carried between CEs and PEs. 
    
   In the case where a link between CE and PE is a numbered non-bundled 
   link, the CPI and VPN-PPI of that link are used for the Type 1 or 2 
   TLVs of the IF_ID RSVP HOP object that is carried between the CE and 
   PE. In the case where a link between CE and PE is an unnumbered non-
   bundled link, the CPI and VPN-PPI of that link are used for the IP 
   Address field of the Type 3 TLV. In the case where a link between CE 
   and PE is a bundled link, the CPI and VPN-PPI of that link are used 
   for the IP Address field of the Type 3 TLVs. 
    
   When an ingress CE originates a Path message to establish an LSP 
   from a particular port on that CE to a particular target port, the 
   CE uses the CPI of its port in the Sender Template object. If the 
   CPI of the target port is an IP address, then the CE uses it in the 
   Session object. And if the CPI of the target port is a <port index, 
   IP address> tuple, then the CE uses the IP address part of the tuple 
   in the Session object, and the whole tuple as the Unnumbered 
   Interface ID subobject in the ERO.  
    
4.3.1.1 Shuffling Sessions 
    
   When the Path message arrives at the ingress PE, the PE selects the 
   PIT associated with the L1VPN, and then uses this PIT to map CPIs 
   carried in the Session and the Sender Template objects to the 
   appropriate PPIs. Once the mapping is done, the ingress PE replaces 
   CPIs with these PPIs. As a result, the Session and the Sender 
   Template objects that are carried in the GMPLS signaling within the 
   service provider network carry PPIs, and not CPIs. The egress PE 
   performs the reverse mapping - it maps PPIs carried in the Session 
   and the Sender Template object into the appropriate CPIs, and then 
   sends the Path message to the egress CE that has the target port. 
   This translation of addresses and session ids is termed shuffling 
   and driven by the L1VPN Port information tables. This must be 
   performed for all RSVP-TE Messages at the PE edges.  In this case 
   there is one CE to CE session. 
    
   At the egress PE, the reverse mapping operation is performed. The PE 
   extracts the ingress/egress PPI values carried in the 
   SENDER_TEMPLATE and SESSION objects (respectively). The egress PE 
   identifies the appropriate PIT to find out the appropriate CPI 
   associated with the PPI of the egress CE. Once the mapping is 
   retrieved, the egress PE replaces the ingress/egress PPI values with 
   the corresponding CPI values. As a result, the SESSION and the 
   SENDER_TEMPLATE objects included in the GMPLS RSVP-TE Path message 
   sent from the egress PE to the egress CE carry CPIs, and not PPIs. 
   Here also, for the GMPLS RSVP-TE Path messages sent from the egress

   PE to CE, the source IP address (of the IP packet carrying this 
   message) is set to the appropriate PE-CC-Addr, and the destination 
   IP address (of the IP packet carrying this message) is set to the 
   appropriate CE-CC-Addr.  
    
   At this point the CE's view is a single LSP point to point between 
   the two CEs with a virtual link between the PE nodes.  CE-PE(-)PE-
   CE.  The L1VPN PE nodes have a view of the PE-PE LSP in all its 
   detail.  The PEs may filter the RSVP-TE signaling removing 
   information about the provider topology and replacing it with a view 
   of a virtual link.  
    
    
4.3.1.2 Stitched or Nested Sessions 
 
   Another option which starts out similarly is when the Path Message 
   arrives at the ingress PE, the PE selects the PIT associated with 
   the L1VPN, and then uses this PIT to map CPIs carried in the Session 
   and the Sender Template objects to the appropriate PPIs. Once the 
   mapping is done, a new PE to PE session is established with the 
   parameters compatible with the CE session. Upon successful 
   establishment of the PE to PE session, the CE signaling request is 
   sent to the egress PE. An additional field is required in the RSVP-
   TE CE to CE path message. The L1vpn Globally unique identifier is 
   carried to the egress PE in order to identify the Egress PIT table 
   to be used to find CPI and the matching VPN-PPI.  
    
   There are a couple of options depending on the LSP switching types. 
   If the CE to CE and PE to PE LSPs are identical in switching type 
   and capacity the LSP may be stitched together and the procedures in 
   [GMPLS-STICHING] apply. If the CE to CE LSPs and the PE to PE LSPs 
   are of not the same switching type or of different but compatible 
   capacity the LSPs may be Nested and the procedures for [GMPLS-
   HIERARCHY] apply.  The Stitched and Nested LSP signaling are 
   analogous procedures. Both result in two sessions: a CE to CE 
   session and a PE to PE session.  
    
   At the ingress PE when stitching and nesting are used a PE to PE 
   session is established. This could be achieved by several means: 
     - Associating an already established PE-PE FA-LSP to the 
      destination that meets the requested parameters. 
     - Establishing a compliant PE-PE LSP. 
    
   At this point the CE's view is a single LSP point to point between 
   the two CEs with a virtual link between the PE nodes.  CE-PE(-)PE-
   CE.  The L1VPN PE nodes have a view of the PE-PE LSP in all its 
   detail.  The PEs do not have filter the RSVP-TE signaling removing 
   information about the provider topology because the PE-PE signaling 
   is not visible to the CE nodes.  
    
4.3.1.3 Other Signaling

   An ingress PE may receive and potentially reject a Path message that 
   contains an Explicit Route Object and so cause the switched 
   connection setup to fail. However, the ingress PE may accept EROs, 
   which include a sequence of [<ingress PE (strict), egress CE CPI 
   (loose)>].  
   -    Path message without ERO: when an ingress PE receives a Path 
   message from an ingress CE that contains no ERO, it MUST calculate a 
   route to the destination for the PE-to-PE LSP and include that route 
   in an ERO, before forwarding the Path message. One exception would 
   be if the egress core node were also adjacent to this core node.  
   -    Path message with ERO: when an ingress PE receives a Path 
   message from an ingress CE that contains an ERO (of the form 
   detailed above), the former computes a path to reach the egress PE. 
   It then inserts this path as part of the ERO before forwarding the 
   Path message. 
 
   An ingress or an egress PE may include a RECORD_ROUTE object and 
   remove/filter the RRO from the received Path message before 
   forwarding it. Further an egress or an ingress PE may remove/filter 
   the RRO from a Resv message before forwarding it. Filtering an RRO 
   consists in editing its content and including only the subobjects 
   based on local or global policy. This allows the ingress/egress CE 
   to be aware of the selected link and labels on the egress/ingress CE 
   side, respectively, for the switched connections constituting this 
   L1VPN. 
 
   The exact format of the extensions is TBD in a future revision.  
    
4.4 Recovery Procedures 
    
   Signaling: 
    
   A CE requests network protected (from PE-to-PE) LSP by using 
   [SEGMENT-REC] technique. Dynamic identification of merge nodes is 
   supported via the LSP Segment Recovery Flags carried in the 
   Protection object (see Section 6.2 of [SEGMENT-REC]). 
    
   Notification: 
    
   A Notify Request object may be inserted in Path or Resv messages to 
   indicate the address of a CE that should be notified of an LSP 
   failure.  Notifications may be requested in both the upstream and 
   downstream directions: 
    
   o) Upstream notification is indicated via the inclusion of a Notify 
   Request Object in the corresponding Path message. 
    
   o) Downstream notification is indicated via the inclusion of a 
   Notify Request Object in the corresponding Resv message. 
    
   A PE receiving a message containing a Notify Request object SHOULD 
   store the Notify Node Address in the corresponding state block. The 
   PE SHOULD also include a Notify Request object in the outgoing Path 
Fedyk & Rekhter.                                         [Page 16] 
 

 
Internet Draft  draft-fedyk-l1vpn-basic-mode-01.txt     Mar. 2006 
 
   or Resv message.  The outgoing Notify Node Address MAY be updated 
   based on local policy.  This means that a PE upon reception of this 
   object from the CE MAY update its value.  
    
   If the ingress CE includes a NOTIFY_REQUEST object into the Path 
   message, the ingress PE MAY replace the received 'IPv4 Notify Node 
   Address' by its own selected 'IPv4 Notify Node Address', and in 
   particular the local TE Router_ID. The Notify Request Object may be 
   carried in Path or Resv messages (Section 7 of [GMPLS-RSVP-TE]). The 
   format of the NOTIFY_REQUEST object is defined in [GMPLS-RSVP-TE]. 
    
   Inclusion of a NOTIFY_REQUEST object is used to request the 
   generation of notifications upon failure occurrence but does not 
   guarantee that a Notify message will be generated.  
    
     
5. Security Considerations 
    
   Since association of a particular port with a particular L1VPN (or 
   to be more precise with a particular PIT) is done by the service 
   provider as part of the service provisioning process (and thus can't 
   be altered via signaling between CE and PE), and since signaling 
   between CE and PE is assumed to be over a private network (and thus
