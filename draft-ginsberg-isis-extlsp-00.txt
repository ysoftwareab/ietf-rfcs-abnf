Abstract 
    

   This draft describes a simplified method for extending the LSP space 
   beyond the 256 Link State PDU (LSP) limit defined in ISO 10589. This 
   method is intended as a preferred replacement for the method defined 
   in RFC 3786.

1.    Conventions used in this document 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [BCP4]. 

2.    Overview 

   [IS-IS] defines the set of LSP fragments which may be originated by 
   a system at each level. This set is limited to 256 fragments. [IS-
   IS] also defines a maximum value for an LSP fragment 
   (originatingLxLSPBufferSize) as 1492 bytes. The carrying capacity of 
   an LSP set is sufficient to advertise the neighbor and leaf node 
   reachability advertisements of an area/domain in anticipated 
   deployment scenarios. However, the definition of additional 
   information to be included in LSPs (e.g. traffic engineering 
   information, router capabilities, etc.) has the potential to exceed 
   the carrying capacity of an LSP set. 

   This issue first drew interest when traffic engineering extensions 
   were introduced. This interest resulted in the solution defined in 
   RFC 3786. However, that solution suffers from restrictions required

   to maintain interoperability with systems which do not support the 
   extensions.  

   This document defines extensions which allow a system to exceed the 
   256 fragment limit and do so in a way which has no interoperability 
   issues with systems which do not support the extension. It is seen 
   as a simpler and therefore preferred solution to the problem. 

3.    Definitions of Commonly Used Terms 

   This section provides definitions for terms that are used throughout 
   the text. The terminology is consistent with that used in RFC 3786. 

   Originating System: A router physically running the IS-IS protocol.  
     As this document describes a method which allows a single IS-IS 
     instance to originate LSPs using multiple instance identifiers, 
     the Originating System represents the single "physical" IS-IS 
     instance. 

   Normal system-id: The system-id of an Originating System as defined 
     by [IS-IS]. 

   Additional system-id: A system-id other than the "Normal system-id" 
     that is assigned by the network administrator to an Originating 
     System in order to allow the generation of extended LSP fragments. 
     The Additional system-id, like the Normal system-id, must be 
     unique throughout the routing area (Level-1) or domain (Level-2). 

   Original LSP: An LSP using the Normal system-id in its LSP ID. 

   Extended LSP: An LSP using an Additional system-id in its LSP ID. 

   LSP set: Logical LSP.  This term is used only to resolve the 
     ambiguity between a logical LSP and an LSP fragment, both of which 
     are sometimes termed "LSP". 

   Extended LSP set: A group of LSP fragments using an Additional 
     system-id, and originated by the Originating System. 

   Extension-capable IS: An IS implementing the mechanisms described in 
     this document. 

4.    Utilizing Additional System IDs 

   This extension allows an Originating System to be assigned 
   additional system-ids which may be used to generate additional LSP 
   sets. The additional system-ids are subject to the same restrictions 
   as normal system-ids i.e. when used at Level-1 the additional 
   system-id MUST be unique within the Level-1 area. When used at 
   Level-2 the additional system-id MUST be unique within the domain.

INTERNET DRAFT    Simplified Extension of LSP Space          Mar 2006 
 
 
   Extended LSPs are treated by the IS-IS Update Process in the same 
   manner as normal LSPs i.e. the same rules as to generation, 
   flooding, purging, etc. apply. In particular, if the Extended LSP 
   with LSP Number zero and remaining lifetime > 0 is not present for a 
   particular additional system-id then none of the extended LSPs in 
   that LSP set shall be processed. 

4.1     Additional Information in Extended LSPs  

   Fragment 0 of an Extended LSP Set MUST include the new IS alias ID 
   TLV defined in Section 4.4. This allows the Extended LSP set to be 
   associated with the Originating System which generated the LSP(s). 

4.2     Extended LSP Restrictions 

   The following restrictions on the information which may appear in an 
   Extended LSP are defined in order to avoid interoperability issues 
   with systems which do not support the extensions defined in this 
   document, 

4.2.1       TLVs Which MUST NOT Appear 

   Information which is directly utilized in the SPF calculation MUST 
   NOT appear in an Extended LSP. This includes the following TLVs 
   currently defined in the IANA IS-IS TLV Codepoints Registry: 

             TLV Name (#) 
             ----------- 
             Area Addresses (1) 
             ES Neighbors (3) 
             Part. DIS (4) 
             Prefix Neighbors (5) 
             The extended IS reachability TLV (22) 
             IP Int. Reach (128) 
             IP Ext. Address (130) 
             The extended IP reachability TLV (135) 
             MT-ISN (222) 
             M-Topologies (229) 
             MT IP. Reach (235) 
             IPv6 IP. Reach (236) 
             MT IPv6 IP. Reach (237) 
    

   If any of the TLVs listed above appear in an Extended LSP, an 
   Extension Capable IS MUST ignore those TLVs on receipt and SHOULD 
   report an error. Other TLVs in that extended LSP set MUST be 
   processed normally.

4.2.2       Overload, Attached, and Partition Repair Bits 

   As Extended LSPs do not contain neighbor or area information the use 
   of the Overload, Attached, and Partition Repair Bits have no 
   significance. All of these bits MUST be set to 0 in all Extended LSP 
   fragments by the originating system and MUST be ignored on receipt. 

4.3     Originating LSP Restrictions 

   An originating LSP MUST NOT advertise a neighbor relationship to any 
   of its additional system-ids. 

4.4     IS Alias ID TLV (IS-Alias) 

   The proposed IS-Alias TLV allows extension-capable ISs to recognize 
   the Originating System of an Extended LSP set. It identifies the 
   Normal system-id of the Originating System.

   No subTLVs are defined in this document. Should future extensions 
   define subTLVs, the subTLVs MUST be formatted as described in RFC 
   3784. 

     
5.    Comparison with the RFC 3786 Solution 

   This document utilizes the same basic mechanism (additional system-
   ids) as RFC 3786 to allow an originating system to generate more 
   than 256 LSP fragments. It differs from RFC 3786 in that it 
   restricts the content of Extended LSPs to information which is NOT 
   utilized in the SPF calculation. 

   Extended LSPs in this new definition are utilized solely to 
   accommodate the additional information which various extensions have 
   defined as new TLV content in LSPs. This distinction allows original 
   LSPs to be used in the traditional manner and supports 
   implementation optimizations which ignore extended LSP content when 
   performing an SPF calculation. 

   Legacy IS-IS implementations which do not support the extensions 
   defined in this document see the extended LSPs as information

INTERNET DRAFT    Simplified Extension of LSP Space          Mar 2006 
 
 
   associated with an unreachable system. Their SPF calculation is 
   therefore consistent with that performed by extension capable ISs. 
   There is therefore no need for the two different operating modes 
   defined in RFC 3786. 

   There is also no need for the special handling of the original LSP 
   set and the extended LSP set(s) as a single Logical LSP during the 
   SPF as specified in Section 5 of RFC 3786. 

6.    Deployment Considerations 

   There are a number of deployment considerations which limit the 
   usefulness of extended LSPs unless all systems are extension-capable 
   ISs. 

6.1     Advertising New TLVs in Extended LSPs 

   As extended LSPs will be utilized to advertise TLVs associated with 
   other protocol extensions (definition of which is outside the scope 
   of this document), it is obvious that the utilization of the 
   information in extended LSPs by legacy IS-IS implementations will be 
   limited. The implication of this is that as implementations are 
   revised to support the protocol extensions which define new TLVs 
   that MAY be advertised in extended LSPs, the implementation SHOULD 
   also be revised to support the extensions defined in this document 
   so that they are capable of processing the new TLVs whether they 
   appear in normal or extended LSPs. 

6.2     Reachability and TLV Staleness 

   In cases where non-SPF information is advertised in LSPs, it is 
   necessary to determine whether the system which originated the 
   advertisement is reachable in order to guarantee that a receiving 
   router does not use or leak stale information. In the case of TLV 
   information found in extended LSPs, the reachability test MUST be to 
   the originating system, not to the additional system ID associated 
   with the extended LSP. Systems which do NOT support the extensions 
   defined in this document will always see the extended LSPs as coming 
   from an unreachable system. They will therefore NOT use information 
   in extended LSPs in cases where reachability is a requirement. 

6.3     Moving TE Information to Extended LSPs 

   One of the major sources of non-SPF related additional information 
   in LSPs is the Traffic Engineering (TE) information carried in the 
   extended IS reachability TLV (22) as defined in RFC 3784 and RFC 
   4205. The restrictions defined in this document prohibit the 
   presence of TLV 22 in Extended LSPs. In the event that there is a 
   need to advertise TE information in Extended LSPs, it would be 
   necessary to define a new TLV to carry the TE information.

INTERNET DRAFT    Simplified Extension of LSP Space          Mar 2006 
 
 
   Utilization of a new TLV for TE information would provide additional 
   benefits which include: 

      . Elimination of the need for redundant IS neighbor TLVs to be 
        processed as part of the SPF. 

      . Easier support for a set of TE information associated with a 
        single link which exceeds the 255 byte TLV limit by allowing 
        the interpretation of multiple TLVs to be considered additive 
        rather than mutually exclusive. 

   Such an extension would require all routers on which the TE 
   information is processed to support the new TLV as well as the 
   extensions defined in this document. Definition of a new TLV to 
   advertise TE information is outside the scope of this document.  

7.    Security Considerations 

   This document raises no new security issues for IS-IS. 

8.    IANA Considerations 

   This document defines the following new ISIS TLV that needs to be 
   reflected in the ISIS TLV code-point registry: 

    Type        Description                            IIH   LSP   SNP 
    ----        -----------------------------------    ---   ---   ---
