1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols.  In particular it defines
   objects for managing MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) Linear
   Protection.

   This MIB module should be used for configuring and managing the MPLS-
   TP linear protection for MPLS-TP LSPs.

   At the time of writing, SNMP SET is no longer recommended as a way to
   configure MPLS networks as was described in RFC 3812 [RFC3812].
   However, since the MIB modules specified in this document are

Internet-Draft        MPLS-TP Linear Protection MIB        December 2015


   intended to work in parallel with the MIB modules for MPLS specified
   in [RFC3812], certain objects defined here are specified with MAX-
   ACCESS of read- write or read-create so that specifications of the
   base tables in [RFC3812] and the new MIB modules in this document are
   consistent.  Although the examples described in Section 7 specify
   means to configure OAM identifiers for MPLS-TP tunnels, this should
   be seen as indicating how the MIB values would be returned in the
   specified circumstances having been configured by alternative means.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

4.  Overview

   RFC 6378 [RFC6378] defines the protocol to provide a linear
   protection switching mechanism for MPLS transport profile with
   protection domain as a point-to-point LSP.  RFC 7271 [RFC7271]
   describes alternate mechanisms to perform some of the functions
   defined in [RFC6378], and also defines additional mechanisms, in
   order to provide operator control and experience that more closely
   models the behavior of linear protection seen in other transport
   networks.  Two modes are defined for MPLS-TP linear protection
   switching: Protection State Coordination (PSC) mode and Automatic
   Protection Switching (APS) mode as specified in [RFC6378] and
   [RFC7271], respectively.  The detailed protocol specification of MPLS
   transport profile linear protection is described in [RFC6378] and
   [RFC7271].

Internet-Draft        MPLS-TP Linear Protection MIB        December 2015


   This document specifies a MIB module for the Label Edge Router (LER)
   that supports MPLS TP Linear protection and a MIB module that defines
   textual conventions.  Objects defined in the document are generally
   applied to both PSC and APS modes.  If an object is valid for a
   particular mode only, it is noted in the description for the object.

5.  Structure of the MIB Module

5.1.  Textual Conventions

   The following new textual conventions are defined in a separate MIB
   module in this document

      MplsLpsReq
      MplsLpsFpathPath
      MplsLpsCommand
      MplsLpsState

5.2.  The MPLS-TP Linear Protection Subtree

   MPLS-LPS-MIB is the MIB module defined in this document, and it is
   put under mplsStdMIB.

5.3.  The Notifications Subtree

   Notifications are defined to inform the management station about
   switchover, provisioning mismatches, and protocol failures of linear
   protection domain.  The following notifications are defined for this
   purpose:

   o  The notification, mplsLpsEventSwitchover is to inform the
      management station about the switchover of the active path.

   o  The notification, mplsLpsEventRevertiveMismatch is to inform the
      management station about the provisioning mismatch in the
      revertive mode across the end point of the protection domain.

   o  The notification, mplsLpsEventProtecTypeMismatch is to inform the
      management station about the provisioning mismatch in protection
      type, representing both bridge and switching types, across the end
      point of the protection domain.

   o  The notification, mplsLpsEventCapabilitiesMismatch is to inform
      the management station about the provisioning mismatch in
      Capabilities TLVs across the end point of the protection domain.

Internet-Draft        MPLS-TP Linear Protection MIB        December 2015


   o  The notification, mplsLpsEventPathConfigMismatch is to inform the
      management station about the provisioning mismatch in the
      protection path configuration for PSC communication.

   o  The notification, mplsLpsEventFopNoResponse is to inform the
      management station about the failure of protocol due to a lack of
      response to a traffic switchover request in 50 ms.

   o  The notification, mplsLpsEventFopTimOut is to inform the
      management station about the failure of protocol due to no
      protocol message received during at least 3.5 times the long PSC
      message interval.

5.4.  The Table Structures

   The MPLS-TP linear protection MIB module has four tables.  The tables
   are as follows

   o  mplsLpsConfigTable

      This table is used to configure MPLS-TP linear protection domain.
      The protection domain is identified by mplsLpsConfigGroupName.
      The other attributes in this table can be used to configure
      properties that are specific to the protection domain.

   o  mplsLpsStatusTable

      This table provides the current status information of MPLS-TP
      linear protection domains that have been configured on the system.
      When a protection domain is configured or deleted in the
      mplsLpsConfigTable, then the corresponding row of that session in
      the mplsLpsStatusTable is, respectively, automatically created or
      deleted.

   o  mplsLpsMeConfigTable

      This table is used to associate the Maintenance Entities (MEs) to
      the protection domain.  The ME is identified by mplsOamIdMegIndex,
      mplsOamIdMeIndex and mplsOamIdMeMpIndex.

   o  mplsLpsMeStatusTable

      This table provides the current information about the protection
      state of MEs that have been configured on the system.  When a ME
      configured or deleted in the mplsLpsMeConfigTable, then the
      corresponding row of that session in the mplsLpsMeStatusTable is,
      respectively, automatically created or deleted.

6.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

6.1.  Relationship to the MPLS OAM maintenance identifiers MIB module

   The mplsLpsMeConfigTable entry is extended by entry in the
   mplsOamIdMeTable defined in draft-ietf-mpls-tp-oam-id-mib
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-oam-id-mib].  Note that the nature of the 'extends'
   relationship is a sparse augmentation so that the entry in the
   mplsLpsMeConfigTable has the same index values as the entry in the
   mplsOamIdMeTable.  Each time that an entry is created in the
   mplsOamIdMeTable for which the LER supports MPLS-TP linear protection
   a row is created automatically in the mplsLpsMeConfigTable.

7.  Example of Protection switching configuration for MPLS-TP TE tunnel

   This example considers the protection domain configuration on a head-
   end LSR to provide protection for a co-routed bidirectional MPLS
   tunnel.

   Only relevant objects which are applicable for protection domain
   identifiers of co-routed MPLS tunnel are illustrated here.

   In mplsOamIdMegTable:
   {
    -- MEG index (Index to the table)
      mplsOamIdMegIndex                 = 1,
      mplsOamIdMegName                  = "MEG1",
      mplsOamIdMegOperatorType          = ipCompatible (1),
      mplsOamIdMegServiceType           = lsp (1),
      mplsOamIdMegMpLocation            = perNode(1),
    -- Mandatory parameters needed to activate the row go here
      mplsOamIdMegRowStatus             = createAndGo (4)
   }

   This will create an entry in the mplsOamIdMegTable to protect the
   MPLS tunnel.

   The following ME table is used to associate the path information to a
   MEG.

      mplsOamIdMeName                   = "ME1",
      mplsOamIdMeMpIfIndex              = 0,

      -- tunnel
      mplsOamIdMeSourceMepIndex         = 0,
      -- Source MEP id is derived from the IP compatible MPLS
      -- tunnel
      mplsOamIdMeSinkMepIndex           = 0,
      mplsOamIdMeMpType                 = mep (1),
      mplsOamIdMeMepDirection           = down (2),
      mplsOamIdMeProactiveOamPhbTCValue = 0,
      mplsOamIdMeOnDemandOamPhbTCValue  = 0,
      --  RowPointer MUST point to the first accessible column
      -- of an MPLS tunnel
      mplsOamIdMeServicePointer         = mplsTunnelName.1.1.1.2,
      -- Mandatory parameters needed to activate the row go here
      mplsOamIdMeRowStatus              = createAndGo (4)
   }

   The below table associates the MEs with protection domains.

          In the 1:1 scheme, a protection path is allocated to
          protect against a defect, failure, or a degradation in the
          working path. In normal conditions, data traffic is
          transmitted over the working path, while the protection path
          functions in the idle state. If there is a defect on the
          working path or a specific administrative request,
          traffic is switched to the protection path.

          bidirectional

          In bidirectional protection scheme, both the directions
          will be switched simultaneously even if the fault applies
          to only one direction of the path.

          unidirectional

          In unidirectional protection scheme protection switching
          will be performed independently for each direction of a
          bidirectional transport path.

9.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some networks in
   a non-secure environment without proper protection can have a
   negative effect on network operations.  These are the tables and
   objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  mplsLpsConfigTable is used to configure MPLS-TP linear protection
      domains.  Improper manipulation of the objects in this table may
      result in different behaviors than network operators have
      originally intended, such as delaying traffic switching or causing
      a race condition with server layer protection after network
      failure (mplsLpsConfigHoldOff), delaying or speeding up reversion
      after recovering network failure (mplsLpsConfigWaitToRestore),
      unexpected traffic switching (mplsLpsConfigCommand), or

Internet-Draft        MPLS-TP Linear Protection MIB        December 2015


      discontinuance of operation of a protection switching control
      process (mplsLpsConfigMode, mplsLpsConfigProtectionType).

   o  mplsLpsMeConfigTable is used to assign each ME either working or
      protection path.  Improper manipulation of this object may result
      in discontinuance of operation of a protection switching control
      process.

   o  In the case of the discontinuance of a protection switching
      control process, network operators will be notified.  However, the
      notification is controlled by mplsLpsNotificationEnable object,
      which is read-write.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  mplsLpsStatusTable and mplsLpsMeStatusTable collectively show the
      history and current status of the MPLS-TP linear protection
      domains.  They can be used to estimate the performances and
      qualities of the network being operated with the MPLS-TP linear
      protection.  If an Administrator does not want to reveal this
      information, then these tables should be considered sensitive/
      vulnerable.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.

   Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the
   SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming
   compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for
   authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)
   RFC 3414 [RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm RFC 3826 [RFC3826].
   Implementations MAY also provide support for the Transport Security
   Model (TSM) RFC 5591 [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport
   such as SSH RFC 5592 [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS RFC 6353 [RFC6353].

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is not
   recommended.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an

   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

10.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign an OID for the MIB module from the "MIB
   Transmission Group - MPLS STD" sub-registry of the "Internet-standard
   MIB - Transmission Group" registry for the MPLS Linear Protection MIB
   module specified in this document.
