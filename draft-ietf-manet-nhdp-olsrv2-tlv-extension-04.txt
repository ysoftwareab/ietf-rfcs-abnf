Internet-Draft       NHDP and OLSRv2 Extension TLVs           March 2014


1.  Introduction

   The MANET Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP) [RFC6130] and the
   Optimized Link State Routing Protocol, version 2 (OLSRv2) [OLSRv2]
   are protocols for use in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) [RFC2501],
   based on the Generalized Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Packet/Message
   Format [RFC5444].

   This document updates [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2], specifically their use
   of TLV (Type-Length-Value) elements, to increase the extensibility of
   these protocols, and to enable some improvements in their
   implementation.

   This specification reduces the latitude of implementations of
   [OLSRv2] and [RFC6130] to consider some messages, which will not be
   created by implementations simply following those specifications, as
   a reason to consider the message as "badly formed", and thus as a
   reason to reject the message.  This gives greater latitude to the
   creation of extensions of these protocols, in particular extensions
   that will interoperate with unextended implementations of those
   protocols.  As part of that, it indicates how TLVs (Type-Length-Value
   elements) [RFC5444] with unexpected value fields must be handled, and
   adds some additional options to those TLVs.

   Note that TLVs with unknown type or type extension are already
   specified as to be ignored by [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2], and also are
   not a reason to reject a message.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   Additionally, this document uses the terminology of [RFC5444],
   [RFC6130], and [OLSRv2].


3.  Applicability Statement

   This document updates the specification of the protocols [OLSRv2] and
   [RFC6130].

   Specifically, this specification updates [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2] in
   the following way:

Internet-Draft       NHDP and OLSRv2 Extension TLVs           March 2014


   o  Removes the latitude of rejecting a message with a TLV with a
      known type, but with an unexpected TLV Value field, for the TLV
      Types defined in [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2].

   o  Specifies the handling of a TLV Value field with unexpected
      length.

   o  Sets up IANA registries for TLV Values for the Address Block TLVs:

      *  LOCAL_IF, defined in [RFC6130].

      *  LINK_STATUS, defined in [RFC6130].

      *  OTHER_NEIGHB, defined in [RFC6130].

      *  MPR, defined in [OLSRv2], now considered as a bit field.

      *  NBR_ADDR_TYPE, defined in [OLSRv2], now considered as a bit
         field.

   o  Defines a well-known TLV Value for "UNSPECIFIED" for the Address
      Block TLV Types LOCAL_IF, LINK_STATUS, and OTHER_NEIGHB, all
      defined in [RFC6130].


4.  TLV Values

   NHDP [RFC6130] and OLSRv2 [OLSRv2] define a number of TLVs within the
   framework of [RFC5444].  These TLVs define the meaning of only some
   of the contents that can be found in a TLV Value field.  This
   limitation may be either only defining certain TLV Values, or
   considering only some lengths of the TLV Value fields (or single
   value field in a multi value Address-Block TLV).  This specification
   describes how NHDP [RFC6130] and OLSRv2 [OLSRv2] are to handle TLVs
   with other TLV Value fields.

4.1.  Unrecognized TLV Values

   NHDP and OLSRv2 specify that, in addition to well-defined reasons (in
   the respective protocol specifications), an implementation of these
   protocols MAY recognize a message as "badly formed" and therefore
   "invalid for processing" for other reasons (Section 12.1 of [RFC6130]
   and Section 16.3.1 of [OLSRv2]).  These sections could be interpreted
   as allowing rejection of a message because a TLV Value field is
   unrecognized.  This specification removes that latitude:

   o  An implementation MUST NOT reject a message because it contains an
      unrecognized TLV value.  Instead, any unrecognised TLV Value field

Internet-Draft       NHDP and OLSRv2 Extension TLVs           March 2014


      MUST be processed or ignored by an unextended implementation of
      NHDP or OLSRv2, as described in the following sections.

   It should be stressed that this is not a change to [RFC6130] or
   [OLSRv2], except with regard to not allowing this to be a reason for
   rejection of a message.  [RFC6130] or [OLSRv2] are specified in terms
   such as "if an address is associated with a value of LOST by a
   LINK_STATUS TLV".  Association with an unrecognized value has no
   effect on any implementation strictly following such a specification.

4.2.  TLV Value Lengths

   The TLVs specified in [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2] may be either single-
   value or multi-value TLVs.  In either case, the length of each item
   of information encoded in the TLV Value field is the "single-length",
   defined and calculated as in section 5.4.1 in [RFC5444].  All TLVs
   specified in [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2] have a one or two octet single-
   length.  These are considered the expected single-lengths of such a
   received TLV.

   Other single-length TLV Value fields may be introduced by extensions
   to [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2].  This document specifies how
   implementations of [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2], or extensions thereof,
   MUST behave on receiving TLVs of the TLV types defined in [RFC6130]
   and [OLSRv2], but with TLV Value fields with other single-length
   values.

   The following principles apply:

   o  If the received single-length is greater than the expected single-
      length, then the excess octets MUST be ignored.

   o  If the received single-length is less than the expected single-
      length, then the absent octets MUST considered to have all bits
      cleared (0).

   Exceptions:

   o  A received CONT_SEQ_NUM with a single-length < 2 SHOULD be
      considered an error.

4.3.  Undefined TLV Values

   [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2] define a number of TLVs, but for some of these
   TLVs specify meanings for only some TLV Values.  This document
   establishes IANA registries for these TLV Values, with initial
   registrations reflecting those used by [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2], and as
   specified in Section 4.3.3.

Internet-Draft       NHDP and OLSRv2 Extension TLVs           March 2014


   There are different cases of TLV Values with different
   characteristics.  These cases are considered in this section.

4.3.1.  NHDP TLVs: LOCAL_IF, LINK_STATUS and OTHER_NEIGHB

   For the Address-Block TLVs LOCAL_IF, LINK_STATUS and OTHER_NEIGHB
   TLVs, defined in [RFC6130], only a limited number of values are
   specified for each.  These are converted, by this specification, into
   extensible registries with initial registrations for values defined
   and used by [RFC6130] - see Section 5.

   An implementation of [RFC6130], receiving a LOCAL_IF, LINK_STATUS, or
   OTHER_NEIGHB TLV with any TLV Value other than the values which are
   defined in [RFC6130] MUST ignore that TLV Value, as well as any
   corresponding attribute association to the address.

4.3.2.  OLSRv2 TLVs: MPR and NBR_ADDR_TYPE

   The Address-Block TLVs MPR and NBR_ADDR_TYPE, defined in [OLSRv2],
   are similar to those defined in [RFC6130] in having only limited
   values specified (1, 2 and 3): 1 and 2, represent presence of two
   different attributes associated to an address, and 3 represents "both
   1 and 2".

   These TLV Value fields, are by this specification, converted to bit
   fields, and MUST be interpreted as such.  As the existing definitions
   of values 1, 2, and 3 behave in that manner, it is likely that this
   will involve no change to an implementation, but any test of (for
   example) Value = 1 or Value = 3 MUST be converted to a test of (for
   example) Value bitand 1 = 1, where "bitand" denotes a bitwise and
   operation.

   This specification creates registries for recording reservations of
   the individual bits in these bitfields, with initial registrations
   for values defined and used by [OLSRv2] - see Section 5.

   Other TLVs defined by [OLSRv2] are not affected by this
   specification.

4.3.3.  Unspecified TLV Values

   The registries defined in Section 5 for the LOCAL_IF, LINK_STATUS and
   OTHER_NEIGHB TLVs each include an additional TLV Value UNSPECIFIED.
   This TLV Value represents a defined value that, like currently
   undefined TLV Values, indicates that no information is associated
   with this address, but will always have this meaning.  Such a TLV
   Value may be used to enable the creation of more efficient multivalue
   Address Block TLVs, or to simplify an implementation.

Internet-Draft       NHDP and OLSRv2 Extension TLVs           March 2014


   The similar requirement for the MPR and NBR_ADDR_TYPES TLVs is
   already satisfied by the TLV Value zero, provided that each bit in
   the TLV Value is defined as set ('1') when indicating the presence of
   an attribute, or clear ('0') when indicating the absence of an
   attribute; this is therefore required for registrations from the
   relevant registries, see Section 5.

   For the LINK_METRIC TLV, this is already possible by clearing the
   most significant bits (0 to 3) of the first octet of the TLV Value.
   It is RECOMMENDED that in this case the remaining bits of the TLV
   Value are either all clear ('0') or all set ('1').


5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to take a total of ten actions as set out in the
   following sections.

5.1.  LOCAL_IF Address Block TLVs

5.1.1.  Create New Registry

   IANA maintains a registry called "Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET)
   Parameters".  IANA is requested to create a new sub-registry called
   "LOCAL_IF TLV Values".

   IANA is requested to populate this registry as specified in Table 1.

   The Designated Experts are required to use the guidelines specified
   in [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2].  IANA is not expected to record this fact
   in the registry.

5.1.2.  Modification to Existing Registry

   IANA maintains a registry called "Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET)
   Parameters" with a sub-registry called "LOCAL_IF Address Block TLV
   Type Extensions".  This sub-registry currently has an entry for value
   0.  IANA is requested to replace the entry in the Description column
   for this value with the text "The value is to be interpreted
   according to the registry LOCAL_IF TLV Values".  The resulting table
   should look as specified in Table 2.

   The Designated Experts are required to use the guidelines specified
   in [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2].  Additionally, the Designated Experts are
   required to ensure that the following sense is preserved:

   o  For each bit in the field, a set bit (1) means that the address
      has the designated property, while an unset bit (0) means that no
      information about the designated property is provided.  In
      particular, an unset bit must not be used to convey any specific
      information about the designated property.  IANA is not expected
      to record these facts in the registry.

6.  Security Considerations

   The presented updates to [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2]:

   o  Create IANA registries for retaining TLV values for TLVs, already
      defined in the already published specifications of the two
      protocols, and with initial registrations for the TLV values
      defined by these specifications.  This does not give rise to any
      additional security considerations.

   o  Enable protocol extensions to be able to register TLV values in
      the created IANA registries.  Such extensions MUST specify
      appropriate security considerations.

   o  Create, in some registries, a registration for "UNSPECIFIED"
      values, for more efficient use of multi-value Address Block TLVs.
      The interpretation of an address being associated with a TLV of a
      given type and with the value "UNSPECIFIED" is identical to that
      address not being associated with a TLV of that type.  Thus, this
      update does not give rise to any additional security
      considerations.

   o  Reduces the latitude of implementations of the two protocols to
      reject a message as "badly formed", due to the value field of a

Internet-Draft       NHDP and OLSRv2 Extension TLVs           March 2014


      TLV being unexpected.  These protocols are specified in terms such
      as "if an address is associated with a value of LOST by a
      LINK_STATUS TLV".  Association with an unknown value (or a value
      newly defined to mean no link status information) has no effect on
      such a specification.  Thus, this update does not give rise to any
      additional security considerations.

   o  Do not introduce any opportunities for attacks on the protocols
      through signal modification that are not already present in the
      two protocols.
