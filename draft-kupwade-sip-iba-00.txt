Abstract

   Session Initiation Protocol is the Internet Engineering Task Force's
   standard for multimedia communications in an IP network.
   Authentication in SIP has been a major concern and most of the
   existing authentication mechanisms in SIP are dependent on public key
   infrastructure (PKI) or shared secrets (passwords).This document
   proposes new authentication schemes in SIP using identity-based
   signature and signcryption schemes.  This approach provides security

   comparable to that of certificate-based authentication while
   preserving the operational simplicity of shared-secret techniques.

1.   Introduction

   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP, RFC 3261 [1]) is an application
   layer control protocol for creating, modifying and terminating
   sessions between one or more user agents.  SIP messages may be
   exposed to a variety of security threats and attacks.  One important
   security issue faced by SIP is authenticating the identity of the
   sender of a SIP message.  Current solutions are based on a variety of
   signature methods.  The most common approach is to use a shared
   secret to digest the message using HTTP Digest Authentication, [15].
   Another technique, called "SIP Identity" involves signing a fixed
   subset of the message using a certificate [19].  The certificate used
   for this signing may be the sender's or may belong to an identity
   service which has presumably used some other means to authenticate
   the sender.  A primary constraint of this approach is that the
   recipient must posses (or be able to obtain) the public key component
   of that certificate in order to validate the signature.  This
   requirement has presumably influenced the low adoption rate of the
   technique.  A potential certificate discovery mechanism is proposed
   in [14].

   Another alternative is to apply a "signcryption" technique to
   selected elements of the message.  The main goal of signcryption
   schemes is to provide authenticity and confidentiality in one logic.
   This also requires key management, but can be combined easily with
   identity-based cryptosystems, allowing end users can to generate
   public keys from a well-known identities.  This document illustrates
   one approach for adapting SIP Identity [7] to take advantage of
   signcryption using identity based techniques.  This document
   introduces the concept of Identity based cryptography in Section 2 ,
   describes the key distribution process proposed by Byoungcheon Lee et
   al. in Section 2.2, describes Hess's algorithm which is used to
   generate the digital signature scheme in a single domain environment
   in Section 2.3, describes Gentry and Silverberg's algorithm for
   generating digital signatures a hierarchical domain environment in
   Section 2.5 , describes Lynn's signcryption scheme for generating a
   signcrypted message in a single domain environment in Section 2.4,
   and describes Chow et al 's signcryption scheme for a hierarchical
   domain environment 2.6.  After establishing these basic techniques,
   the document then describes a procedure by which identity based
   authentication can be applied to SIP by extending the mechanism of
   RFC 4474 [7].

2.1.  Overview

   The concept of identity based cryptography was first proposed by
   Shamir in 1984 [18].  The basic idea behind an identity based
   cryptosystems is that end users can choose an arbitrary string
   (example: their email address or SIP Uniform Resource Identifier
   (URI) or IP address) which represents their identity to compute their
   public key.  Thus they do not need digital certificates from a
   Certificate authority (CA).  The private keys paired to the identity
   based public keys are distributed by some trusted third-party Private
   Key Generator (PKG).  Figure 1 illustrates the key distribution
   process proposed by Byoungcheon Lee et al in the single domain
   environment [8].

   Alice and Bob pick their secrets and compute their blinding factors.
   They then send a request for a partial private key to the domain's
   PKG along with the blinding factor.  The credentials that the PKG
   would use to verify the authenticity of an end user's identity(Alice
   or Bob's identity) is outside the scope of this document.  The PKG
   sends back their respective partial private keys and the end users
   generate their private keys from their secrets.  An interceptor or an
   eavesdropper will not be able to generate the private key as he has
   no knowledge of the secret that was chosen by Alice or Bob. Hence
   there is a secure key exchange between the PKG and the end users.  If
   Alice would want to authenticate herself to Bob, then she could
   either generate a digital signature using Hess's algorithm or a
   signcrypted message using Lynn's algorithm and then send it to Bob
   [9],[10].  Bob would use Alice's identity to generate her public key
   and then verify the digital signature or the signcrypted message.
   Signcrypted messages can only be verified by the intended recipient
   as he would use his own private key along with sender's public key to
   validate the ciphertext.  Identity based authentication can be easily
   extended to a two level hierarchical domain environment.  Figure 2
   describes the key distribution process for a two level hierarchical
   system

   belonging to Biloxi.com.  The PKGs serving Alice and Bob would
   procure their private keys from a Root PKG (R-PKG) using Byoungcheon
   Lee et al.'s algorithm [8].  Alice would then use Gentry and
   Silverberg's algorithm to generate a digital signature or Chow et
   al.'s algorithm to generate a signcrypted message [16],[17]

2.2.  Key Distribution Using Byoungcheon Lee et al's algorithm

   Shamir constructed an Identity-Based Signature (IBS) scheme using the
   existing RSA function [19], but he was unable to construct an
   Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) scheme, which became a long lasting
   open problem [18].  Recently in 2001, Shamir's open problem was
   independently solved by Boneh and Franklin using the concept of
   bilinear maps [5].  Hence, it led to a new area of research where
   many identity based digital signature schemes were proposed using the
   concept of bilinear maps.  Below is a brief review of the private key
   distribution process proposed by Byoungcheon Lee et al [8].

   Let H_1,H_2 and H_3 are three hash functions such that

   H_1 : {0, 1}^l-->G_1 where l is the length of the plain text.

   H_2 : {0, 1}^l * G_2 --> Z_q where Z_q = Z/qZ denotes integers mod q
   where q is a large prime.  Therefore Z_q denotes the group {0, 1, 2,
   .........., q -1} and (Z_q)^* = Z\{0}.

   H_3 : G_2 --> (Z_q)^*

   The PKG specifies two groups G_1 and G_2 of order q, where G_1 is an
   additive group and G_2 is a multiplicative group and a bilinear map e
   : G_1 * G_1 --> G_2 between the group which satisfies the following
   properties,

   o  Bilinear: Let x_1, x_2 and y belong to G_1.  Then e(x_1 + x_2, y)
      = e(x_1, y).e(x_2, y)t

   o  Non-degenerate: There exists x belongs to G_1 and y belongs to G_1
      such that e(x, y) NOT EQUAL 1

   In fact G_1 will be a point subgroup on an elliptic curve over a
   finite field and G_2 is a subgroup of a cyclic group of a larger
   finite field.  The pairings are derived from the Weil or Tate pairing
   [5].

   The PKG chooses a private key s_0 belong to Z*q and computes the
   master public key

   P_0 = s_0.P where P belong to G_1

Internet-Draft    Identity based authentication in SIP     February 2008


   The security of the master public key is dependent on the elliptic
   curve discrete log problem [6].  It publishes the description of the
   groups G_1 and G_2, the bilinear map e,hash functions (H_1, H_2 and
   H_3), public key P_0 and the group element P .Alice with identity
   ID_A chooses a random secret x belong to Z*q and computes a blinding
   factor X = xP .  She then requests the PKG to issue a partial private
   key by sending X and ID_A.

   The PKG then validates Alice's identity and computes the public key
   of Alice as

   Q_ID_A = H_1(ID_A)

   It computes a blinded partial private key as Q_bl_A = H_3[e(s_0X,
   P_0)]s_0Q_ID_A

   It then generates a signature Sig(Q_bl_A) for integrity protection.
   Sig(Q_bl_A) = soQ_bl_A

   It sends Sig(Q_bl_A) and Q_bl_A to Alice.  Alice verifies the
   signature using the below mentioned formula, e(Sig(Q_bl_A), P ) ?=
   e(Q_bl_A , P_0)

   and finally retrieves her private key D_ID_A by unblinding Q_bl_A as
   follows D_ID_A = Q_bl_A H_3[e(P_0, P_0)x]

2.3.  Single Domain Signatures Using  Hess's Algorithm

   Alice will then use the algorithm proposed by Hess to generate the
   digital signature .  She would pick her secret

   k BELONGS TO (Z_q)^*, and then calculate

   r = e(P_1, P )^k where P_1 BELONGS TO G_1

   v = H_2(m, r) where m is the message

   u = v*D_ID_A + k*P_1

   She would then send the signature (u, v) to Bob. Bob would calculate
   r from (u, v).

   r = e(u, P ).e(H_1(ID_A), -P_0)v And validate the signature if

   v ?= H_2(m, r)

2.4.  Heirarchical Domain Signatures Using Lynn's Algorithm

   Let

   H_4 : {0, 1} * {0, 1} --> Z_q

   H_5 : Z_q * G_2 --> {0, 1}*

   H_6 : {0, 1}l --> {0, 1}*

   Alice would compute

   q = H_4(k, m)

   and

   w = e(D_ID_A , Q_ID_B )

   Alice would send the signcrypted message {U, V, W } to Bob where

   {U, V, W } = { q , E_n_(H_5[q,w]) (k) , E_n(H_6[k])(m) }

   En(Key) refers to encryption using AES algorithm [22]

   Bob would decrypt the message m as shown below

   e(Q_ID_A , D_ID_B) = w

   D_n_(H_5[U,w])(V) = k

   D_n_(H_6)[k](W) = m

2.5.  Single Domain Signcryption Using Gentry and Silverberg's Algorithm

   Let the Root PKG's master private key be M_s BELONGS TO (Z^*)_q and
   the master public key be

   Q_0 = M_s*P where P BELONGS TO G1

   PKG at Atlanta.com with identity (ID_1) and the PKG at Biloxi.com
   with identity (ID_2) generate their private keys D_ID_1and D_ID_2
   using the Byoungcheon Lee et al's algorithm respectively.

   Let the public keys of PKG at Atlanta.com and the PKG at Biloxi.com
   be Q_ID_1 = H_1(ID_1)

   and Q_ID_2 = H_1(ID_2)

   Q_bl_A = H_3[e(s_1*X, Q_1)]S_A where

   S_A = D_ID_1 + s_1*Q_ID_A The PKG at Atlanta.com would generate a
   public parameter Q_1 = s_1*P

   Alice would generate her private key as shown below

   D_ID_A = (Q_bl_A) /(H_3[e(Q_1, Q_1)^x])

   Similarly the PKG at Biloxi.com would pick a secret s_2 BELONGS TO
   (Z^*)_q and compute the blinded partial private key Q_bl_B and the
   public parameter Q_2.

   She would then generate the signature as shown below

   Sig_gs = S_A + k*P_M

   where

   P_M = H_1(m)

   She would calculate the public parameter Q_M = kP

   She would send Sig_gs, Q_0, Q_1 and Q_M to Bob. Bob would verify the
   signature as show below

   e(P, Sig_gs) ?= e(Q_0, Q_ID_1).e(Q_M , P_M ).e(Q_1, Q_ID_A)

   Let

   Alice would generate the signature

   Sig_c = D_ID_A + kP_M

   and compute

   g = e(Q_0, kQ_ID_2)

   She would generate the signcrypted message as shown below,

   U_1 = Q_M , U_2 = k*Q_ID_B , V = E_n_H_7[g](m|| Si g_c||ID_B), W_1=
   Q_0, W_2 =Q_1, W_3 =Q_M

   Alice would send {U_1, U_2, V, W_1, W_2, W_3} to Bob.

   Bob would compute e(U_1, D_ID_B ) / e(Q_2, U_2) = g

   and then decrypt V as , D_n_H_7[g](V) = (m|| Si gc||IDB)

   He would then verify the signature as shown below,

   e(P, Si g_c).e(W_2, Q_ID_A) ?= e(W_1, Q_ID_1 )*e(W_3, P_M )


3.   Identity Based Authentication in SIP

   RFC 4474 [7] provides a model for signing a SIP request using
   conventional public-key techniques.  The signature itself is carried
   in a header field called "Identity".  A related header field called
   "Identity-Info" conveys supporting information, including a location
   from which the certficicate used to create the signature may be
   retrieved if the recipient does not yet have it.  This document re-
   uses those header fields by following the extension sytnax of RFC
   4474.  The signed or singcrypted text is transmitted in the
   "Identity" header field, as in RFC 4474.  The "Identity-Info" header
   field is extended to allow the recipient to discover that the
   signature being presented is identity-based and determine which
   algorithm was used in the calculation.  The syntax as used in this
   document is believed to be slightly flawed but could be reasonably
   adapted for consistency with RFC 4474.  Note that the nature of the
   identity relationship here allows meaningful use of the Identity
   header in response messages as well as request messages.  The "From"
   header field of each request encodes the identity used for message
   signing, and the "To" header field encodes the target identity used
   for signcryption (is signcryption is used) as well as the identity
   from which responses will be anticipated if this technique is used to
   protect messages sent in response.  One open issue is whether there
   may be multiple root PKG namespaces potentially valid for a given
   domain.  If so, then the "Identity-info" header field will need to
   encode a pointer into the PKG namespace.

   Let us consider the case where Alice belonging to example.com with a
   SIP URI sip:alice@example.com would want to authenticate herself to
   Bob (sip:bob@example.com).  She would compute the digital signature
   using Hess's algorithm [described in section 2.3] or the signcrypted
   message using Lynn's algorithm [described in section 2.4].  The
   message m is calculated by hashing the SIP header fields of the
   INVITE message as recommended in RFC 4474 [7].  In case of a

   hierarchical domain environment Alice belonging to atlanta.com with a
   SIP URI (sip:alice@atlanta.com) would want to authenticate herself to
   Bob belonging to biloxi.com (sip:bob@biloxi.com).

   The following text includes several sample SIP messages signed using
   this technique.  The first is an INVITE message with the digital
   signature generated using Hess's algorithm.  The second uses a
   signcrypted header field generated using Lynn's algorithm in a single
   domain environment.  The third sample is an INVITE message with a
   signature generated using Gentry and Silverberg's algorithm, and the
   fourth is showas a signcrypted headerfield generated using Chow's
   algorithm in a two level hierarchical domain environment.  As with
   RFC 4474, the contents of the Identity header field are encoded using
   the Base64 algorithm [21].  Although these sampel messages are all
   requests, the technique can be applied to responses, allowing
   recipient Bob to authenticate himself to Alice by inserting
   appropriate Identity and Identity-Info header fields into the
   response message 200 OK.

4.  Performance of Identity Based Authentication in SIP

   The authentication mechanism discussed in this document allows the
   end users to directly authenticate each other.  This scheme also
   reduces the burden on the SIP proxies as they need not play the role
   of an authenticator.  We used the Pairing-based Cryptography Library
   [24] to generate the identity based signatures/signcryption schemes.
   We choose pairings of Type A curves because they are fast and are
   used where the main concern is efficiency.  Type A pairings are
   constructed on the curves y^2 = x^3 + x over the field F_p where p is
   some prime.  We choose the group order to be 160 bits and the order
   of the base field to be 512 bits.  RFC 4474 uses SHA1 hashing
   algorithm whose output size is 160 bits with RSA as their signing

   algorithm [7].  We used SHA256 hashing algorithm whose output size is
   256 bits with signing algorithms that are dependent on elliptic curve
   cryptography.  Table 1 compares the processing time to generate the
   digital signatures between our scheme and the scheme proposed by RFC
   4474.  Times for RFC 4474 were calculated using the OpenSSL library.
   All message parsing was done by hand.

   +---------------+------------------------+--------------------------+

     Table 1: Comparision of CPU time between IBA schemes and RFC 4474

   We observe a 28.44% decrease in the processing time in generating
   digital signatures when generated using Hess's algorithm and 14.66%
   decrease in the processing time when generated using Gentry and
   Silverberg's algorithm.  We also observe a 53.63% decrease in the
   processing time in verifying the digital signatures when generated
   using Hess's algorithm and 42.72% decrease in the processing time
   when generated using Gentry and Silverberg's algorithm.  While we
   observe an increase in processing time when compared to the
   signcryption schemes, but the signcryption schemes perform both
   authentication and encryption in one logic.  In our scheme the end
   users need not append their X.509 v3 certificates and hence there is
   a substantial amount (10 K bytes) of decrease in the payload


5.   Revocation in Identity Based Systems

   In case of PKI, the public key certificates contain a preset
   expiration date.  If the validity date expires, or if the sender
   (caller) refreshes his private key, then the recipient (callee) would
   have to obtain a new certificate from a public key repository which
   would involve the onerous task of certificate path construction and
   path validation processes.

   But in case of Identity based encryption system the sender can
   generate a public key using the recipient's identity (SIP URI) along
   with the expiration date.  If the date has expired, the recipient
   needs to obtain a new private key from the PKG.  As a result the
   recipient would clearly by pass the tedious task of obtaining a new
   public key certificate from a public key repository.



Kupwade Patil & Willis   Expires August 20, 2008               [Page 17]

Internet-Draft    Identity based authentication in SIP     February 2008


   One could make this approach more granular by generating the public
   key using the recipient's identity along with the current date.  In
   this case it would force the recipient to obtain a new private key
   every day.  If the end user leaves the domain in which he was
   registered, the PKG is instructed to stop issuing private keys for
   that end user's SIP URI.  As a result

   Bob can no longer prove his identity unless he obtains a new private
   key from the new domain's PKG.  But, on of the most prominent
   features with IBE is that the sender need not communicate with any
   third party controlled certificate directory to obtain the
   recipient's public key.

   Alice could also generate a unique public key for Bob by
   concatenating Bob's SIP URI along with a Universally Unique
   Identifier (UUID) and then generate a digital signature or a
   signcrypted message [23].  Therefore if Bob wants to verify the
   signature or decrypt the signcrypted message, Bob would have to
   request a new partial private key from its domain's PKG.


6.  Conclusion

   The advantages with the proposed methods are:

   1.  Key size: Elliptic-curve cryptography arguably provides
       equivalent security with smaller operands than the RSA technique
       typically used with [7].  This provides some advantage for
       resource-constrained environments such as mobile telephones.  It
       also reduces the cryptographic load on large-scale devices doing
       frequent authentication checks.

   2.  Key discovery: Callers can generate the public key of the callee
       from the identity (SIP URI) of the callee and vice versa.  This
       eliminates a requirement for a key discovery mechanism using
       external sources, making deployment significantly easier.

   3.  Certificate validation: As a result caller or callee need not go
       through the complex path construction process to retrieve the
       public keys of a chain of CAs from the public key depositories
       which are controlled by the respective CAs.  This allows
       deployment in a peer-to-per modality without a need to route SIP
       messages through a centralized identity service or trust peer
       nodes to operate as identity services.

   4.  Revocation: The ease of minting new identities and discovering
       keys allows short-lived identities, reducing the need for
       certificate revocation lists and the checking thereof.  This

Internet-Draft    Identity based authentication in SIP     February 2008


       offers very large operational advantages in resource constrained
       environments.

   The primary disadvantage of the proposed method relates to the the
   single-root model of private key generation.  There is, however,
   ongoing research on loosely-coupled heirarchical PKGs that should
   lead to the alleviation of this constraint.  However, in the typical
   usage scenarios of single and confederated domains, the single-root
   model is not particularly disadvantageous.

   The proposed model seems to be especially well-suited for peer-to-
   peer SIP environments [ 13], wherein there are no "identity servers"
   or "trusted proxies" in the traditional sense.  The enrollment
   process can include private key generation, allowing nodes to
   therafter operate securely using the methodology of this document.
