         The following are comments and restrictions not captured by the
         above grammar.

         A <media-type> is any MIME media type [RFC2046] which is
         registered in the appropriate IANA registry [IANA-MT].  There
         is no default for the <media-type> specification.  If omitted,
         then the media type is unspecified, thus leaving the
         application complete freedom to interpret the resource.

         If the <hash-scheme> specification is omitted, then the length
         of the <hash-value> unambiguously selects one of "sha1",
         "sha256", "sha384", or "sha512" according to the following
         table.

                length of <hash-value>    |    implied <hash-scheme>
            ------------------------------+-----------------------------
                       32                 |          "sha1"
                       56                 |          "sha256"
                       80                 |          "sha384"
                      104                 |          "sha512"

         A <hash-value> is a non-empty sequence of characters encoding a
         sequence of bits which must be a valid hash for the specified
         hash-scheme.  The encoding depends on the <hash-scheme>.  If
         <hash-scheme> is "md5", then <hash-value> is the base16
         encoding [RFC3548] of the 16 octets of the MD5 hash value of
         the resource (most significant octet first) so that the <hash-
         value> consists of 32 HEXDIG.  If <hash-scheme> is "sha1", then
         <hash-value> is the base32 encoding [RFC3548] of the 20 octets
         of the SHA1 hash value of the resource (most significant octet
         first) so that the <hash-value> consists of 32 BASE32DIG.  The
         other "sha" <hash-value>s are handled analogously according to
         the above table.

         In any case, the <hash-value> MUST provide the correct number
         of bits for the chosen <hash-scheme>, 128 for "sha1", 256 for
         "sha256", 384 for "sha384", and 512 for "sha512".
