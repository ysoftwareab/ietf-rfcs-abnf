  <h1 id="rfc.section.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.1">1.</a> Introduction</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">A multihomed node may have multiple provisioning domains (via physical and/or virtual interfaces). For example, a node may be simultaneously connected to a wired Ethernet LAN, a 802.11 LAN, a 3G cell network, one or multiple VPN connections or one or multiple tunnels(automatic or manual). Current laptops and smartphones typically have multiple access network interfaces and, thus, are often connected to different provisioning domains.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">A multihomed node receives configuration information from each of its attached networks, through various mechanisms such as DHCPv4 <a href="#RFC2131">[RFC2131]</a>, DHCPv6 <a href="#RFC3315">[RFC3315]</a>, PPP <a href="#RFC1661">[RFC1661]</a> and IPv6 Router Advertisements <a href="#RFC4861">[RFC4861]</a>. Some received configuration objects are specific to an interface such as the IP address and the link prefix. Others are typically considered by implementations as being global to the node, such as the routing information (e.g. default gateway), DNS servers IP addresses, and address selection policies, herein named "node-scoped".</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.3">When the received node-scoped configuration objects have different values from each provisioning domains, such as different DNS servers IP addresses, different default gateways or different address selection policies, the node has to decide which one to use or how it will merge them.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.4">Other issues are the result of simulatenous attachment to multiple networks, such as addressing and naming space overlaps, regardless of the provisioning mechanism.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.5">The following sections define the multiple interfaces (MIF) node, the scope of this work, describe related work, list issues and then summarize the underlying problems.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.6">A companion document <a href="#I-D.ietf-mif-current-practices">[I-D.ietf-mif-current-practices]</a> discusses some current practices of various implementations dealing with MIF.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.2">2.</a> Terminology</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.1">Administrative domain <br><br> </p>

<ul class="empty"><li>A group of hosts, routers, and networks operated and managed by a single organization <a href="#RFC1136">[RFC1136]</a>.</li></ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.2">Provisioning domain <br><br> </p>

<ul class="empty"><li>A set of consistent configuration information (e.g.  Default router, Network prefixes, DNS,...) and the corresponding interface.  One administrative domain may have multiple provisioning domains. Successful attachment to the provisioning domain implies that the terminal attaches to the corresponding interface with appropriate configuration information.</li></ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.3">Reference to IP version <br><br> </p>

<ul class="empty"><li>When a protocol keyword such as IP, PPP, DHCP is used in this document without any reference to a specific IP version, then it implies both IPv4 and IPv6. A specific IP version keyword such as DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 is meant to be specific to that IP version.  </li></ul>

<p> </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.3">3.</a> Scope and Existing Work</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.1">This section describes existing related work and defines the scope of the problem.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.3.1">3.1.</a> <a href="#belowIP" id="belowIP">Below IP Interaction</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.1">Some types of interfaces have link layer characteristics which may be used in determining how multiple provisioning domain issues will be dealt with. For instance, link layers may have authentication and encryption characteristics which could be used as criteria for interface selection. However, network discovery and selection on lower layers as defined by <a href="#RFC5113">[RFC5113]</a> is out of scope of this document. Moreover, interoperability with lower layer mechanisms such as services defined in IEEE 802.21, which aims at facilitating handover between heterogeneous networks <a href="#MIH">[MIH]</a>, is also out of scope.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.2">Some mechanisms (e.g., based on a virtual IP interface) allow&#160;sharing&#160;a&#160;single&#160;IP&#160;address&#160;over&#160;multiple interfaces&#160;to&#160;networks with disparate access technologies. From the IP stack view on the node, there is only a single interface and single IP address. Therefore, this situation is out of scope of this current problem statement. Furthermore, link aggregation done under IP where a single interface is shown to the IP stack is also out of scope. </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.3.2">3.2.</a> MIF node Characterization</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.1">A MIF node has the following characteristics: <br><br> </p>

<ul>
<li>A <a href="#RFC1122">[RFC1122]</a> IPv4 and/or <a href="#RFC4294">[RFC4294]</a> IPv6 compliant node</li>
<li>A MIF node is configured with more than one IP addresses (excluding loopback and link-local)</li>
<li>A MIF node can attach to more than one provisioning domains, as presented to the IP stack. </li>
<li>The interfaces may be virtual or physical. </li>
<li>Configuration objects come from one or more administrative domains.</li>
<li>The IP addresses may be from the same or from different address families, such as IPv4 and IPv6. </li>
<li>Communications using these IP addresses may happen simultaneously and independently.</li>
<li>Some communications using these IP addresses are possible on all the provisioning domains, while some are only possible on a smaller set of the provisioning domains.</li>
<li>While the MIF node may forward packets between its interfaces, forwarding packets is not taken into account in this definition and is out of scope for this document.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.3.3">3.3.</a> Hosts Requirements</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.1">The requirements for Internet Hosts <a href="#RFC1122">[RFC1122]</a> describe the multihomed node as if it has multiple IP addresses, which may be associated with one or more physical interfaces connected to the same or different networks.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.2">The requirements states that The node maintains a route cache table where each entry contains the local IP address, the destination IP address, Differentiated Services Code Point and Next-hop gateway IP address. The route cache entry would have data about the properties of the path, such as the average round-trip delay measured by a transport protocol. Nowadays, implementations are not caching these informations. </p>
<p><a href="#RFC1122">[RFC1122]</a> defines two host models: </p>

<ul>
<li>The "Strong" host model defines a multihomed host as a set of logical hosts within the same physical host. In this model a packet must be sent on an interface that corresponds to the source address of that packet.</li>
<li>The "Weak" host model describes a host that has some embedded gateway functionality. In the weak host model, the host can send and receive packets on any interface.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.4">The multihomed node computes routes for outgoing datagrams differently depending on the model. Under the strong model, the route is computed based on the source IP address, the destination IP address and the Differentiated Services Code Point. Under the weak model, the source IP address is not used, but only the destination IP address and the Differentiated Services Code Point.</p>

<a href="#rfc.section.3.8">3.8.</a> <a href="#CM" id="CM">Session management</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.8.p.1">Some implementations, specially in the mobile world, rely on higher-level session manager, also named connection manager, to deal with issues brought by simultaneous attachment to multiple provisioning domains. Typically, the session manager may deal with the selection of the interface, and/or the provisioning domain, on behalf to the applications, or tackle with complex issues such as policies conflict resolution (<a href="#POL-ISSUES">Section 4.3</a>). As discussed previously in <a href="#INTF-SEL">Section 3.7</a>, the session manager may encounter difficulties because of multiple and diverse criteria.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.8.p.2">Session managers usually leverage the link-layer interface to gather information (e.g lower layer authentication and encryption methods, see <a href="#belowIP">Section 3.1</a>) and/or for control purpose. Such link-layer interface may not provide all required services to make a proper decision (e.g. interface selection). Some OS, or terminals, already implement session managers <a href="#I-D.ietf-mif-current-practices">[I-D.ietf-mif-current-practices]</a> and vendor-specific platforms sometimes provides specific socket API (<a href="#API">Section 3.9</a>) a session manager can use. However, the generic architecture of a session manager and its associated API are not currently standardized, so session management behavior may differ between OS and platforms.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.8.p.3">Multiple interfaces management sometimes relies on a virtual interface. For instance, virtual interface allows to support multi-homing, inter-technology handovers and IP flow mobility in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 network <a href="#I-D.ietf-netext-logical-interface-support">[I-D.ietf-netext-logical-interface-support]</a>. This virtual interface allows a multiple-interfaces node sharing a set of IP addresses on multiple physical interfaces and can also add benefits to multi-access scenarios such as 3GPP Multi Access PDN Connectivity <a href="#TS23.402">[TS23.402]</a>. In most cases, the virtual interface will map several physical network interfaces and the session manager should control both, the configuration of each one of these virtual and physical interfaces, as well as the mapping between the virtual and the sub-interfaces.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.8.p.4">In multiple interfaces situation, active application sessions should survive to path failures. Here, the session manager may come into play but only relying on existing mechanisms to manage multipath (MPTCP <a href="#I-D.ietf-mptcp-architecture">[I-D.ietf-mptcp-architecture]</a>) or failover (MIP6 <a href="#RFC3775">[RFC3775]</a>, SHIM6 <a href="#RFC5533">[RFC5533]</a>).

S1 serves with some private namespace "private.example.com". The user or the application uses a name "a.private.example.com" which is within the private namespace of S1 and only resolvable by S1.  Any of the following situations may occur: <br><br> </p>

<ol>
<li>M1 stack, based on its routing table, uses I2 to reach S1 to resolve "a.private.example.com". M1 never reaches S1. The name is not resolved.</li>
<li>M1 keeps only one set of DNS server addresses from the received configuration objects and kept S2 address. M1 sends the forward DNS query for a.private.example.com to S2. S2 responds with an error for an non-existent domain (NXDOMAIN). The name is not resolved. This issue also arises when performing reverse DNS lookup. In the same situation, the reverse DNS query fails.</li>
<li>M1 keeps only one set of DNS server addresses from the received configuration objects and kept S2 address. M1 sends the DNS query for a.private.example.com to S2. S2 asks its upstream DNS and gets an IP address for a.private.example.com. However, the IP address is not the same one S1 would have given. Therefore, the application tries to connect to the wrong destination node, or to the wrong interface of the latter, which may imply security issues or result in lack of service.</li>
<li>S1 or S2 has been used to resolve "a.private.example.com" to an <a href="#RFC1918">[RFC1918]</a> address. Both N1 and N2 are <a href="#RFC1918">[RFC1918]</a> addressed networks. If addresses overlap, traffic may be sent using the wrong interface. This issue is not related to receiving multiple configuration objects, but to an address overlap between interfaces or attaching networks.</li>
<li>M1 has resolved an FQDN to locally valid IP address when connected to N1. If the node looses connection to N1, the node may try to connect, via N2, to the same IP address as earlier, but as the address was only locally valid, connection setup fails. Similarly, M1 may have received NXDOMAIN for an FQDN when connected to N1. After detachment from N1, the node should not assume the FQDN continues to be nonexistent on N2.</li>
<li>M1 requests AAAA record from a DNS server on a network that uses protocol translators and DNS64 <a href="#I-D.ietf-behave-dns64">[I-D.ietf-behave-dns64]</a>. If the M1 receives synthesized AAAA record, it is guaranteed to be valid only on the network it was learned from.  If the M1 uses synthesized AAAA on any other network interface, traffic may be lost, dropped or forwarded to the wrong network.</li>
</ol>

<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.2">Some networks requires the user to authenticate on a captive web portal before providing Internet connectivity. If this redirection is achieved by modifying the DNS reply, specific issues may occur.  Consider a MIF node (M1) with an active interface(I1) connected to a network (N1), which has its DNS server (S1), and another active interface (I2) connected to a network (N2), which has its DNS server (S2). Until the user has not authenticated, S1 is configured to respond to any A or AAAA record query with the IP address of a captive portal, so as to redirect web browsers to an access control portal web page. This captive portal can be reached only via I1. When the user has authenticated to the captive portal, M1 can resolve an FQDN when connected to N1.

Or, the connection succeeds, bypassing the security policy on N1, possibly exposing the owner of M1 to prosecution.</li>
<li>M1 keeps only one set of DNS server addresses from the received configuration objects and kept S1 address.  M1 sends the DNS query for a.example.com to S1.  S1 provides the address of its captive portal. M1 attempts to contact this IP address using I1. The application fails to connect, resulting in lack of service.

<ol>

<li>For the IP1 address family, M1 has one default route (R1, R2) per network (N1, N2). IP1 is reachable by both networks, but N2 path has better characteristics, such as better round-trip time, least cost, better bandwidth, etc.... These preferences could be defined by user, provisioned by the network operator, or else. M1 stack uses R1 and tries to send through I1. IP1 is reached but the service would be better by I2.  </li>
<li>For the IP1 address family, M1 has a default route (R1), a specific X.0.0.0/8 route R1B (for example but not restricted to RFC1918 prefix) to N1 and a default route (R2) to N2.

<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.2">A MIF node may have multiple routes to a destination. However, by default, it does not have any hint concerning which interface would be the best to use for that destination. The first-hop selection may leverage on local routing policy, allowing some actors (e.g. network operator or service provider) to influence the routing table, i.e. make decision regarding which interface to use. For instance, a user on such multihomed node might want a local policy to influence which interface will be used based on various conditions. Some SDOs have defined policy-based routing selection mechanisms. For instance, the Access Network Discovery and Selection Function (ANDSF) <a href="#TS23.402">[TS23.402]</a> provides inter-systems routing policies to terminals with both a 3GPP and non-3GPP interfaces.  However, the routing selection may still be difficult, due to disjoint criteria as discussed in <a href="#CM">Section 3.8</a>. Moreover, information required to make the right decision may not be available.

<ol>
<li>M1 receives from both networks (N1 and N2) an update of its default address selection policy. However, the policies are specific to each network. The policies are merged by M1 stack.

<li>The network requires a web-based authentication (e.g. the access network is a WiFi Hot Spot). In this case the user can only access to a captive portal.

<a href="#rfc.section.5">5.</a> Underlying problems and causes</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.1">This section lists the underlying problems, and their causes, which lead to the issues discussed in the previous section. The problems can be divided into five categories: 1) Configuration 2) DNS resolution 3) Routing 4) Address selection and 5) session management and API. They are shown as below: <br><br> </p>

<ol>
<li>Configuration. In a MIF context, configuration information specific to a provisioning domain may be ignored because: <ol>
<li>Configuration objects (e.g. DNS servers, NTP servers, ...) are node-scoped. So the IP stack is not able to maintain the mapping between information and corresponding provisioning domain.</li>
<li>Same configuration objects (e.g. DNS server addresses, NTP server addresses, ..) received from multiple provisioning domains may be overwritten.</li>
<li>Host implementations usually do not keep separate network configuration (such as DNS server addresses) per provisioning domain.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
</li>
<li>DNS resolution <ol>
<li>Some FQDN can be resolvable only by sending queries to the right server (e.g. intranet services). However, DNS query could be sent to the wrong interface because DNS server addresses may be node-scoped.</li>
<li>A DNS answer may be only valid on a specific provisioning domain but applications may not be aware of that mapping because DNS answers may not be kept with the provisioning from which the answer comes from.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
</li>
<li>Routing <ol>
<li>In the MIF context, routing information could be specific to each interface. This could lead to routing issue because, in current node implementations, routing tables are node-scoped.</li>
<li>Current node implementations do not take into account the Differentiated Services Code Point or path characteristics in the routing table.</li>
<li>Even if implementations take into account path characteristics, the node has no way to properly merge or reconciliate the provisioning domain preferences.</li>
<li>a node attached to multiple provisioning domain could be provided with incompatible selection policies. If the different actors (e.g. user and network operator) are allowed to provide their own policies, the node has no way to properly merge or reconciliate multiple selection policies.</li>
<li>The problem of first hop selection could not be solved via configuration (<a href="#INTF-SEL">Section 3.7</a>), and may leverage on sophisticated and specific mechanisms (<a href="#CM">Section 3.8</a>).  </li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
</li>
<li>Address selection <ol>
<li>Default Address Selection policies may be specific to their corresponding provisioning domain. However, a MIF node may not be able to manage per-provisioning domain address selection policies because default Address Selection policy is node-scoped.</li>
<li>On a MIF node, some source addresses are not valid if used on some interfaces or even on some default routers on the same interface. In this situation, the source address should be taken into account in the routing table; but current node implementations do not support such a feature.</li>
<li>Source address or address selection policies could be specified by applications. However, there is no advanced APIs to allow applications realizing such operations. </li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
</li>
<li>Session management and API <ol>
<li>Some implementations, specially in the mobile world, have higher-level API and/or session manager (aka connection manager) to address MIF issues. These mechanisms are not standardized and do not necessarily behave the same way across different OS, and/or platforms, in the presence of the MIF problems. This lack of consistency is an issue for user and operator who could experience different session manager behaviors depending on the terminal.</li>
<li>Session managers usually leverage on interface to link layer to gather information (e.g lower layer authentication and encryption methods) and/or for control purpose. However, such link layer interface may not provide all required services (e.g. may not provide all information allowing to make a proper interface selection). </li>
<li>A MIF node can support different session managers, which may have contradictory ways to solve the MIF issues. For instance, because of different selection algorithms, two different session managers could select different domains in a same context. Or, when dealing with different domain selection policies, a session manager may give precedence to user policy while another could favor mobile operator policy.</li>
<li>When host routing is updated and if weak host model is supported, ongoing TCP sessions may break if routes changes for these sessions. When TCP sessions should be bound to the interface, the strong host model should be used.</li>
<li>When provided by different actors (e.g. user, network, default-OS), policies may conflict and, thus, need to be reconciliated at the host level. Policy conflict resolution may impact other functions (e.g. naming, routing).</li>
<li>Even if the node has managed to configure an interface, Internet connectivity could be not available. It could be due to an access control function coming into play above the layer 3, or because of poor layer 2 conditions. IP connectivity check should be performed before selecting an interface.</li>

<p id="rfc.section.9.p.1">The initial Internet-Drafts prior to the MIF working group and the discussions during the MIF BOF meeting and on the mailing list around the MIF charter scope on the mailing list brought very good input to the problem statement. This draft steals a lot of text from these discussions and initial drafts (e.g. <a href="#I-D.yang-mif-req">[I-D.yang-mif-req]</a>, <a href="#I-D.hui-ip-multiple-connections-ps">[I-D.hui-ip-multiple-connections-ps]</a>, <a href="#I-D.ietf-mif-dns-server-selection">[I-D.ietf-mif-dns-server-selection]</a>). Therefore, the editor would like to acknowledge the following people (in no specific order), from which some text has been taken from: Jari Arkko, Keith Moore, Sam Hartman, George Tsirtsis, Scott Brim, Ted Lemon, Bernie Volz, Giyeong Son, Gabriel Montenegro, Julien Laganier, Teemu Savolainen, Christian Vogt, Lars Eggert, Margaret Wasserman, Hui Deng, Ralph Droms, Ted Hardie, Christian Huitema, R&#233;mi Denis-Courmont, Alexandru Petrescu, Zhen Cao, Gaetan Feige, Telemaco Melia and Juan-Carlos Zuniga.
