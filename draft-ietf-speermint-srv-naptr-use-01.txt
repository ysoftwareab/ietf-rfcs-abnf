1. Introduction 
 
   A service provider needs to identify the ingress Session Initiation  
   Protocol (SIP) (RFC 3261 [1]) server of a peering network before it  
   can signal and route SIP based real-time communication sessions.   
   This function of locating the ingress SIP server of peering network  
   is typically performed by the egress SIP server of the service 
   provider originating the SIP session.  Also, the ingress server in  
   the peering network needs to locate the originating service 
   provider’s egress server in situations where the peering connection 
   to it gets terminated after receiving the SIP requests or if the 
   egress SIP server of originating service provider fails.  The SIP 
   servers at originating and peering side use the DNS procedures, using 
   both SRV [2] and NAPTR [3] records, in order to locate each other. 
    
 
 
2. Terminology 
    
   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", 
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", 
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [2] and 
   indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations.

3. Session Peering Setup 
 
   SIP systems are represented by user agents (UA).  The diagram below 
   shows the case of direct peering where a user agent (UA1), hosted by 
   a service provider SP1, initiates a SIP session to a User Agent 
   (UA2), hosted by service provider SP2. The egress SIP server of SP1 
   is a SIP signaling path border element (SBE) as defined in section 3 
   of[6], called SBE1, that interfaces with session peering service 
   provider SP2. The SIP session initiated by UA1 is received by this 
   network element SBE1.  The resource to which the SIP request needs to 
   be routed by SBE1 is identified by a SIP or SIPS URI.  This could be 
   the SIP URI of UA2 found in the Request-URI of the SIP request 
   received by SBE1, or the next hop from SBE1 found in the topmost 
   Route header of SIP request.  In order to determine the resource to 
   route the request to, SP1 MAY make use of ENUM [4] lookup services or 
   an internal lookup to determine the SIP URI of the resource.  This 
   lookup MAY be performed by SBE1 or another network element of SP1.

   In order to route the SIP request to this resource in SP2, SBE1 needs 
   to determine the ingress SIP signaling path border element for SP2, 
   called SBE2, by resolving the SIP or SIPS URI in DNS.  SBE1 makes use 
   of the NAPTR and DNS SRV mechanism defined in [5] to determine the IP 
   address, port, and transport protocol for peering with the SP2 
   ingress SIP proxy server (i.e. SBE2).  SBE1 and SBE2 which are 
   involved in the session peering, support a set of protocols and have 
   list of preferences for these protocols. UDP, TCP and TLS MUST be 
   supported by these proxies.   
    
   As a best current practice, SBE1 and SBE2 SHOULD be deployed in a 
   highly scalable and highly available manner, such as a cluster of 
   servers. These servers are of different prioritization and weight, to 
   ensure capacity-based load balancing.  
    
    
   The figure below shows the case of indirect/transit peering where 
   SBE2 is the ingress SIP server of a transit service provider. The 
   mechanism to locate SBE2 is the same as described for direct peering 
   scenario.

   The figure below shows a high level SIP call flow setting up a direct 
   SIP peering session between SP1 and SP2. In this call flow a VoIP 
   session is established between a caller, Bob (sip:bob@sp.com), in SP1 
   and callee, Alice (sip:alice@sp2.com), in SP2 using SIP INVITE 
   request. All SIP signaling MUST go through the SBE1 and SBE2 as these 
   are the ingress and egress points in SP1 and SP2 network.

   The target, to which the request is sent, is determined by SBE1 as 
   follows: 
 
3.1 TARGET Determination 
 
   The target resource is identified with a SIP or SIPS URI.  This is    
   the URI in the Route header, if present, or the URI from the request    
   URI of the SIP request received by SBE1.  
   The host value of the hostport component of the URI is the TARGET.     
   This TARGET is the domain to be contacted. The NAPTR/SRV/A lookup as 
   described in the following section should be skipped if 
   transport/port/IP address is already specified for the target URI. 
    
 
3.2 NAPTR Lookup 
 
   Next the SBE1 determines the transport protocol of the TARGET by 
   performing a NAPTR query for the TARGET.  NAPTR processing as 
   described in [3] will result in the discovery of the most preferred 
   transport protocol of a server instance of SBE2 and SRV records.  
    
   Considering our example call flow setup above, SBE1 wishes to resolve 
   sip:alice@sp2.com and performs a NAPTR query for that TARGET domain 
   sp2.com, and the following NAPTR records are returned: 
    
   ;          order pref flags service      regexp  replacement 
      IN NAPTR 50   50  "s"  "SIPS+D2T"     ""    _sips._tcp.sp2.com 
      IN NAPTR 90   50  "s"  "SIP+D2T"      ""    _sip._tcp.sp2.com 
      IN NAPTR 100  50  "s"  "SIP+D2U"      ""    _sip._udp.sp2.com 
    
   DNS MUST return at least three records - one with "SIP+D2T", one with 
   "SIP+D2U" and one with "SIPS+D2T" service type for the case of direct 
   and indirect peering (section 4.3 in [6]). For indirect (transit) 
   peering (section 4.4 in [6]) since domain validation as specified in 
   section 26.3.2.2 of [1] for TLS at layer 5 will not work, SIPS over 
   TLS cannot be used. 
 
3.3 SRV Lookup 
    
   Depending on what transport protocols SBE1 supports, SBE1 selects one 
   from the preference list of NAPTR results and performs the SRV lookup 
   to obtain a list of available server instances for SBE2. TLS SHOULD 
   be the preferred transport protocol for peering between SBE1 and 
   SBE2.

   In our example SBE1 uses TCP, the SRV lookup for _sip._tcp.sp2.com 
   would return list of available servers : 
    
    
    
    
      ;;          Priority Weight Port   Target 
          IN SRV  0        1      5060   server1.sp2.com 
          IN SRV  0        2      5060   server2.sp2.com 
    
    
   Alternatively, if no NAPTR records are found, then SBE1 uses the 
   preferred transport protocol and issues an SRV query for that 
   specific transport using "_sips" for SIPS URI and SIP URI with TLS 
   and "_sip" for SIP URI as the SRV domain prefix. 
    
   In our example, SBE1 prefers to use TCP and target SIP URI of SP2 is 
   sip:alice@sp2.com, it sends a SRV query for _sip._tcp.sp2.com.  
    
   The SRV responses MAY also include A records with it. 
 
3.4 Using SRV Results 
    
   If A records are not returned with the SRV responses, procedure from 
   RFC 2782 describes how to use and interpret the results obtained from 
   the SRV query.  The target entry of the SRV RRs is looked up by 
   querying the DNS for address records. If the SRV response from DNS 
   includes A records with it, it will cut down on round trips and 
   lookup of DNS again for target entry. On determining the transport 
   protocol, service, port and address record from the SRV RRs as 
   described above, the SBE1 will try to connect to the (protocol, 
   address, service).  Once the connection is established to an 
   available instance of SBE2, SBE1 sends the SIP request to SBE2.  SBE1 
   MUST act in a stateful manner and any retransmission of SIP requests 
   for a specific SIP transaction, including ACKS for non-2xx response 
   or CANCEL for that SIP transaction MUST go to the same server 
   instance of SBE2. 
    
   When SBE1 sends the SIP request to SBE2, it SHOULD set the sent-by 
   parameter of the topmost Via header in the SIP request to a domain 
   that identifies SBE1.  It MUST not specify the port. 
 
 
4. High Availability 
 
   High Availability is ensured by detecting failures in the ability to 
   connect to SBE1 and SBE2 server instances.  In the event of a 
   failure, when SBE1 tries to send SIP INVITE to SBE2, the following 
   failures could occur:

4.1 SBE1 Fails to Reach SBE2 
    
   A 503 error response is reported by the transaction layer, or failure 
   can occur at the transport layer due to TCP disconnect in connection, 
   ICMP error in UDP or time out at transport layer or SIP layer timeout 
   when it’s not receiving any SIP response.  In such situations, SBE1 
   tries a new SIP request transaction to the next available server 
   instance of SBE2 as determined by SRV RRs entry. The SIP T1 timer on 
   SBE1 SHOULD be configurable with a upper limit value of 500ms. A 
   shorter value of T1, say 100ms, reflects a faster failover support. 
 
4.2 SBE2 Fails to Reach SBE1 
    
   Failure may also occur after the request is received by SBE2 from 
   SBE1 due to closure of the transport connection the request came in 
   on at SBE2, before the response can be sent back to SBE1.  In this 
   situation, SBE2 uses the domain value present in the 'sent-by' 
   parameter in the top most Via header of the received SIP INVITE, and 
   queries for SRV records at this domain name using the service 
   identifier "_sips" if the Via transport is "TLS", "_sip" otherwise.  
   The sorted list of SRV RRs are obtained and used as described in [2]  
   to send the response back to SBE1.  If the topmost element in the 
   list of server instances of SBE1 fails, the next available one is 
   tried.

   4.2] 
 
 
5. Caching/TTL 
    
    
5.1 Caching  
   SBE SHOULD use caching of DNS results to eliminate unnecessary DNS 
   queries. 
    
5.2 TTL 
    
   SRV RRs have a TTL value based on which the SBE1 caches the entry 
   for that duration, if it supports caching, and any further requests 
   to the same TARGET domain are delivered to the cached server 
   instance.  The TTL recommended for SRV is about 1 hr.  The TTL for 
   NAPTR is much higher, about 1 day (24hrs) since the NAPTR records do 
   not vary that often as compared to SRV.
