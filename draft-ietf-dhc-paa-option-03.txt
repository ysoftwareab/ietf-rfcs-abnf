Internet-Draft              PAA DHCP options                   June 2006


1.  Introduction

   The Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access (PANA)
   [I-D.ietf-pana-pana] defines a new Extensible Authentication Protocol
   (EAP) lower layer that uses IP between the protocol end points.

   The PANA protocol is run between a PANA Client (PaC) and a PANA
   Authentication Agent (PAA) in order to perform authentication and
   authorization for the network access service.

   This document specifies DHCPv4 [RFC2131] and DHCPv6 [RFC3315] options
   that allow PANA client (PaC) to discover PANA Authentication Agents
   (PAA).  This is one of the many methods for locating PANA
   Authentication Agents: manual configuration is an example of another
   one.


2.  Terminology

   This document uses the PANA terminology defined in [I-D.ietf-pana-
   pana].

   This document uses the DHCP terminology defined in [RFC2131],
   [RFC2132] and [RFC3315].


3.  Requirements

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


4.  DHCP Specification Dependency

   This document describes new options for DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 for
   obtaining a list of IP addresses to locate a PANA Authentication
   Agent.

   This document should be read in conjunction with the DHCPv4
   specifications [RFC2131], [RFC2132] and DHCPv6 specification
   [RFC3315].

   Definitions for terms and acronyms not specifically defined in this
   document are defined in [RFC2131], [RFC2132] and [RFC3315].

5.  PANA Authentication Agent DHCPv4 Option

   This section defines a DHCPv4 option that carries a list of 32-bit
   (binary) IPv4 addresses indicating one or more PANA Authentication
   Agents (PAA) available to the PANA client.

   The DHCPv4 option for PANA Authentication Agent has the format shown
   in Fig. 1.

     Figure 1: PAA DHCPv4 option

   option-code:        OPTION_PANA_AGENT (TBD)

   option-length:      Length of the 'options' field in octets;
                       Must be a multiple of four (4)

   PAA IPv4 Address:   IPv4 address of a PAA for the client to use.
                       The PAAs are listed in the order of preference
                       for use by the client.


   A DHCPv4 client requests the PAA DHCPv4 Option in a Parameter Request
   List as described in [RFC2131] and [RFC2132].

   The DHCPv4 client MUST try the records in the order listed in the PAA
   DHCPv4 option.


6.  PANA Authentication Agent DHCPv6 Option

   This section defines a DHCPv6 option that carries a list of 128-bit
   (binary) IPv6 addresses indicating one or more PANA Authentication
   Agents (PAA) available to the PANA client.

   The DHCPv6 option for PANA Authentication Agent has the format shown
   in Fig. 2.

   option-length:      Length of the 'options' field in octets;
                       Must be a multiple of sixteen (16)

   PAA IPv6 Address:   IPv6 address of a PAA for the client to use.
                       The PAAs are listed in the order of preference
                       for use by the client.


   A DHCPv6 client requests the PAA DHCPv6 option in an Options Request
   Option (ORO) as described in the DHCPv6 specification [RFC3315].

   The DHCPv6 client MUST try the records in the order listed in the PAA
   DHCPv6 option.


7.  IANA Considerations

   The following DHCPv4 option code for PANA Authentication Agent option
   must be assigned by IANA:


   Option  Name           Value       Described in
   -----------------------------------------------
   OPTION_PANA_AGENT       TBD         Section 5


   The following DHCPv6 option codes for PANA Authentication Agent
   options must be assigned by IANA:

   ------------------------------------------------
   OPTION_PANA_AGENT        TBD         Section 6


8.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations in [RFC2131], [RFC2132] and [RFC3315]
   apply.  If an adversary manages to modify the response from a DHCP
   server or insert its own response, a PANA Client could be led to
   contact a rogue PANA Agent, possibly one that then intercepts call
   requests or denies service.
