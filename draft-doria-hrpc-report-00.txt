1.  Background

   The recognition that human rights have a role in Internet policies
   has become part of the general discourse.  Several reports from
   former United Nations (UN) Special Rapporteur on the promotion and
   protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, Frank
   La Rue, have made such relation explicit, which lead to the approval
   of the landmark resolution "on the promotion, protection and
   enjoyment of human rights on the Internet" at the UN Human Rights
   Council (HRC).  And, more recently, to the resolution "The right to
   privacy in the digital age" at the UN General Assembly.  The
   NETmundial outcome document affirms that human rights, as reflected
   in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights [UDHR], should underpin
   Internet governance principles.  Recently the UNESCO report:

Internet-DraftHuman Rights Protocol Considerations - Report October 2015


   Keystones to foster inclusive Knowledge Societies [UNESCO] focused on
   the importance of developing the Internet on the basis of human
   rights principles.

   Nevertheless, the direct relation between Internet Standards and
   human rights is still something to be explored and more clearly
   demonstrated.

   Concerns for freedom of expression and association were a strong part
   of the world-view of the community involved in developing the first
   Internet protocols.  Apparently, by intention or by coincidence, the
   Internet was designed with freedom and openness of communications as
   core values.  But as the scale and the commercialization of the
   Internet has grown, the influence of such world-views had to compete
   with other values, such as ease of development and cost.  The purpose
   of this research is to discover and document the consideration
   involved in taking human rights into account when creating protocols.

   In a manner similar to the work done for RFC 6973 [RFC6973] on
   Privacy Consideration Guidelines, the premise of this research is
   that some standards and protocols can solidify, enable or threaten
   human rights.

   As stated in RFC 1958 [RFC1958], the Internet aims to be the global
   network of networks that provides unfettered connectivity to all
   users at all times and for any content.  Open, secure and reliable
   connectivity is essential for rights such as freedom of expression
   and freedom of association, as defined in the Universal Declaration
   of Human Rights [UDHR].  Therefore, considering connectivity as the
   ultimate objective of the Internet, this makes a clear case that the
   Internet is not only an enabler of human rights, but that human
   rights lie at the basis of, and are ingrained in, the architecture of
   the network.

   An essential part of maintaining the Internet as a tool for
   communication and connectivity is security.  Indeed, "development of
   security mechanisms is seen as a key factor in the future growth of
   the Internet as a motor for international commerce and communication"
   RFC 1984 [RFC1984] and according to the Danvers Doctrine RFC 3365
   [RFC3365], there is an overwhelming consensus in the IETF that the
   best security should be used and standardized.

   In RFC 1984 [RFC1984], the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) and the
   Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG), the bodies which oversee
   architecture and standards for the Internet, expressed: "concern by
   the need for increased protection of international commercial
   transactions on the Internet, and by the need to offer all Internet
   users an adequate degree of privacy."  Indeed, the IETF has been

   doing a significant job in this area [RFC6973] [RFC7258], considering
   privacy concerns as a subset of security concerns.  [RFC6973]

   Besides privacy, it should be possible to highlight other aspects of
   connectivity embedded in standards and protocols that can have human
   rights considerations.  This report focuses on freedom of expression
   and the right to association and assembly online.

2.  Terminology

   Currently defined in draft-dkg-hrpc-glossary to be folded in at
   appropriate time.

3.  Link between protocols and human rights

   -  Include discussion of value laden engineering as discussed in
      [Cath].

   This work discusses four basic architectural principles that are
   encoded in Internet Technology:

   -  Openness, Permissionless Innovation, and Content Agnosticism

   -  Interoperability

   -  Redundancy and the Distributed Architecture

   -  The End-to-End Principle

   The work by Cath explores the relationship of the architectural
   principles to the human right of freedom of expression and asks
   whether the IETF has an repsonsiblity toward human rights.  The fact
   that there is documentation of normative principles among the body of
   work of the IETF, is an indication that ethics are sometimes seen as
   within the purview of IETF consideraitons.  The research question
   asked by the work is:

      "Should the right to freedom of speech be instantiated in the
      protocls and standards of the Internet Engineering Task Force?"

   Becasue of the threat of fragmentation by countries that do not
   accept human rights, the answer given to the research question is
   negative: human rights should not be instantiated in the Interent in
   order to avoid fragmentation.  Care must be taken to avoid making the
   protocols political targets.  On the other hand the principles that
   are encoded in the Internet do make it better at enabling rights.
   This encourages work such as the work done for privacy considerations

   in the IETF and the research being done on protocol consideration for
   the freedoms of expression and association.

   -  Include discussion of "Values and Networks" work by Roland Bless

   -  Include discussion of principles from NetMundial Multistakeholder
      Statement

3.1.  Discussion of Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and
      Internet Architecture

   This project is focused on two rights defined in the UDHR [UDHR],
   Article 19 on Freedom of Expression and Article 20 of Freedom of
   Association.

   Article 19  Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and
      expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without
      interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas
      through any media and regardless of frontiers.

   Article 20  1 Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly
      and association.

      2 No one may be compelled to belong to an association.

3.2.  Theory

   When looking at protocols the considerations can apply from several
   perspectives.

   -  The protocol's direct effects on human rights on the Internet.

   -  The protocol's direct effect on human rights in combination with
      other protocols

   -  The effect of specific protocol elements, separately or in
      combination with other protocol elements on human rights on the
      Internet

   -  The ability to determine when various effects are occurring, i.e.
      transparency

   -  The effect of deployment or non deployment.  While this may be may
      seem beyond the protocol itself, often the design of protocol, its

      difficulty in implementation and the degree to which it contains
      required elements, poison pills or other protocol artifacts that
      either encourage or discourse implementation or deployment can be
      significant in the overall human rights affect of a protocol.

3.3.  Other relevant research

   TBD : Look at, and summarize some of the academic research on the
   topic including Ian Brown [Brown], Laura Denardis [Denardis], David
   Post [Post], Jonathan Zittrain [Zittrain] among others.

4.  Methodology

   Currently defined in detail in draft-varon-hrpc-methodolgy to be
   folded in at appropriate time.  this will largely be a reproduction
   of Section 3 of that document that focuses on the methodology

   Briefly methodology has included:

   -  scoping the research problem

   -  determining terminology to be use linking engineering and human
      rights concepts

   -  establishing methodology

   -  case studies on a set of protocols

   -  derivation of possible considerations

5.  Case Studies

   In each of the case studies, the behavior of the protocols is
   analysed for its positive and negative effects.  In some case these
   effects are due to the design of the protocol itself, in others they
   are due to existing or absent features.

   Early versions of the analysis on the following protocols are
   currently being discussed on HRPC list.  Once the discussions have
   matured those discussions will be folded in this section.

5.1.  DNS

5.2.  IP

   Text being done by Will Scott on HRPC list, current snapshot included
   in [HRPC-Method].

5.3.  HTTP

   Text being done by Nex / Claudio on HRPC list, current snapshot

   in [HRPC-Method].

5.5.  P2P

   Text being done by Nex on HRPC List, current snapshot included in
   [HRPC-Method].

6.  Possible areas for protocol considerations

   The case studies point to several areas of protocol behavior that may
   be appropriate for considerations:

   -  Character encoding for internationalization

   -  DNS Record

      o  Distortion

      o  Injection

      o  Removal

   -  Network Poisoning

   -  Traffic

      o  Interception

      o  Manipulation

      o  Throttling

   -  User Identification

      o  Source and Destination visibility

Internet-DraftHuman Rights Protocol Considerations - Report October 2015


      o  Tracking

   Additionally, discussion of the rights themselves and the evidence of
   these rights being implicit in the IETF design principles [Clark] and
   in some of the existing architecture and protocols, [Cath] and
   [Liddicoat] suggest other considerations.  [Cath] recommends that
   adhereing to the four fundamental architectural principles discussed
   above is a first step.

7.  Next Steps

   Once the first take at consideration are defined, what are the next
   steps for creating something that can be useabble for protocol
   designers and implementers in considering the human rights of freedom
   of expression and freedom of association in their work.
