1 Abstract

   This document proposes mapping DNS names into the URL scheme space for
   the purpose of preventing namespace collisions amongst URL schemes 
   whose syntax and functionality are not appropriate for standardization.

2 Introduction

   In [URL-REG] a process is established for registering new URL
schemes. 
   However this registration process is centralized and keyed toward 
   schemes that define new standards.

   Not all URL schemes need to be standardized. Many schemes are 
   registered with client software so as to activate software, not to 
   specify a generalized function. In such cases the key concern is the 
   prevention of URL scheme name collisions, not an open registration 
   of the URL's syntax or functionality.

3 DNS URL Prefix Scheme Syntax

   Scheme = "DNS+" domain "+" [extension]
   domain = see [STD13] section 3.5
   extension = URL-Scheme
   URL-Scheme = see the scheme production in [URL-SYNTAX] section 4.1

4 Examples

   The owner of the foo.bar.com DNS name would, under this proposal, be 
   given control of the DNS+foo.bar.com+ URL scheme. The scheme can be 
   used by itself to form URLs, for example, 
   DNS+foo.bar.com+://www.nowhere.com/somewhere or can be used as a 
   prefix, for example, 
   DNS+foo.bar.com+any-legal-scheme-characters:anything:anywhere.

5 Namespace Ownership

   Whoever owns a particular DNS name owns all DNS URL scheme names as 
   defined under this standard. If a DNS name should change ownership 
   then all DNS URL scheme names defined using this standard are 
   transferred to the new owner.

6 Trademarks

   The trademark ramifications of this scheme are left in the hands of 
   those who define names under this scheme. As no central authority 
   handles registration of the names there is no central authority to 
   be served with court papers. As such there are no special trademark 
   issues that need to be addressed by the specification.
