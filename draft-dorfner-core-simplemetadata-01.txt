      SimpleMetadata: An interoperable format for sharing metadata
                  draft-dorfner-core-simplemetadata-01

Abstract

   This document describes a  standardized container format for storing
   serializable metadata. It does not describe any additional new
   format, but provides a shell for the exchange of arbitrary,
   structured data. It shall provide the possibility to store and share
   any kind of metadata, including encryption support. The idea is to
   create an open, universal and interoperable standard for storing and
   distributing every kind of metadata independent from media type or
   file format.

1  Introduction

   Nowadays a variety of media file are shared and published all over
   the world. Information about the origin, purpose or copyright of
   these files getting more and more important. There are already
   different standards which enhance files with metadata, like ID3
   <http://id3.org/>, Exif <https://www.exif.org/> or Dublin Core
   [RFC5013]. SimpleMetadata shall create the foundation to unite these
   standards and provide an universal and open container format. The
   idea is not to describe any additional new format, but provides a
   shell for the exchange of arbitrary, structured data. Any metadata
   payload shall be created, stored and shared with an open standard,
   like JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)  [RFC7159] in combination with
   schema validation <https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-handrews-json-
   schema-00.txt>. Every data structure of metadata can be defined and
   distributed within schema definitions. Furthermore, SimpleMetadata
   can be extended by additional formatters or crypto standards.

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2. Structure

   The SimpleMetadata format consists of the three parts, Header, Schema
   URI and Metadata payload.  
   +-------------------------------------------------------------------+
   |            Header (12 bytes)  (fixed length)                      |
   +-------------------------------------------------------------------+
   |            Schema URI  (variable length, optional)            | 
   +-------------------------------------------------------------------+
   |            Serialized Metadata   (variable length)              |
   +-------------------------------------------------------------------+

2.1 Header Definition

   +----------------------------------------------------------------+
   |         Identifier "SMD"           3 Bytes / string              |
   +----------------------------------------------------------------+
   |         Version                        1 Byte / number            |
   +----------------------------------------------------------------+
   |         Serialization                1 Byte / number            |
   +----------------------------------------------------------------+
   |         Crypto                         1 Byte / number            |
   +----------------------------------------------------------------+
   |         Schema URI Length    2 Bytes / number          |  
   +----------------------------------------------------------------+
   |        Content Length            4 Bytes / number          |     
   +----------------------------------------------------------------+

2.2 Identifier

   The first three bytes of the header are always "SMD" to check if
   SimpleMetadata is present. 

2.3 Version 

   Defines the used  version of the SimpleMetadata format.
   1 = Current version

2.4  Serialization

   Defines the used formatter for the metadata. A formatter serializes
   or deserializes the metadata with the corresponding procedure. The
   standard formatter uses Binary JSON (BSON) <http://bsonspec.org/>
   with the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)  [RFC7159].

   0 = BSON 

2.5 Crypto

INTERNET DRAFT               SimpleMetadata               March 24, 2019


   Defines the used crypto standard for en/decrypting metadata.

   0 = None encryption
   1 = Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 

2.6 Schema URI length

   Defines the string length of a schema or type. If no schema is
   defined the schema length is 0. The schema information is described
   in chapter 3.

2.6 Content Length

   Defines the length of the serialized metadata, based on the selected
   formatter (Chapter 2.3). If the content is encrypted, the length is
   calculated over the encrypted string.

3  Schema information

   The schema information can be used to validate the metadata against a
   schema or type. A schema information is an optional string with
   variable length encoded with UTF-8. It is recommended to use an URI ,
   e.g. "http://exampleschemas.org/Person". Moreover a local file path
   or even a type definition (AssemblyQualifiedName) can be used. For
   interoperability,  metadata should be based on public schema.

   The length of the schema is stored in the header (See chapter 2.6).

4 Metadata Content

   Basically every serializable content can be stored as metadata. It is
   highly recommended to use for interoperability and compatibility the
   JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) [RFC7159] for metadata and the
   according schema definition.

5 Notes

   Adding SimpleMetadata to a file will damage it under circumstances,
   unless there is a suitable parser to handle the format!

6 Security Considerations

   Sensitive metadata can be encrypted within a supported crypto
   standard (Chapter 2.4).

7  IANA Considerations

   All data must be stored in UTF-8 [RFC2044].
