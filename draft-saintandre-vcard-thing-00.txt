Internet-Draft              vCard KIND:thing                  April 2011


1.  Rationale

   Version 4 of the vCard specification [VCARD] defines a new KIND
   property that specifies the kind of object that a vCard represents.
   During working group discussion of that specification, the "thing"
   value of the KIND property was removed, with the expectation that the
   value might be defined in a vCard extension.  Therefore, this
   document defines the "thing" value, which is intended to represent
   non-human entities such as physical objects and software
   applications.  As one example of the "thing" KIND, vCards are
   currently used in the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol
   [XMPP] to represent XMPP servers that are deployed on the network.


2.  Properties

   The base vCard specification defines a large number of properties,
   and more properties might be defined in vCard extensions.  The
   following base properties make sense for vCards that represent things
   (some of these properties might apply to the administrators of the
   entity, such as a contact email address, or to the provider of a
   service, such as a logo).

   o  FN
   o  ADR
   o  TEL
   o  EMAIL
   o  IMPP
   o  LANG
   o  TZ
   o  GEO
   o  LOGO
   o  URL
   o  KEY


3.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to add "thing" to its registry of values for
   the vCard KIND property.


4.  Security Considerations

   Use of vCards to represent non-human entities is not envisioned to
   introduce security considerations beyond those specified for vCards
   in general as described in [VCARD].
