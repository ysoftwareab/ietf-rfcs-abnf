 Abstract 
    
   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) 
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.  
   This document proposes an extension to the Ethernet-like Interfaces 
   MIB for the capability to manage Ethernet-in-the-First-Mile (EFM) 
   devices.       
    
1  Introduction 
 
    
   New capabilities have been added to Ethernet like interfaces within 
   the PIEEE802.3ah project for Ethernet in the First Mile (EFM).  This 
   memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for 
   use with network management protocols in the Internet community to 
   manage the new capabilities of EFM Ethernet interfaces.    
    
1.1 Specification of Requirements

2  The Internet-Standard Management Framework 
    
   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current 
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of 
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].   
    
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally 
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).  
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the 
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a 
   MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 
   58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 
   2580 [RFC2580]. 
 
3  Overview 
    
   Ethernet networks have evolved over time from an enterprise backbone 
   to a variety of other applications.  The IEEE P802.3ah task force 
   has defined extensions to the Ethernet standard for Ethernet 
   deployments in the access space.   
    
   The Ethernet-in-the-First-Mile (EFM) task force has focused its 
   efforts into four categories: optics, copper, Ethernet passive 
   optical networks (Ethernet PON, or EPON), and operations, 
   administration, and maintenance (OAM).    
    
   Generally, one can categorize the changes developed by IEEE P802.3ah 
   as extending Ethernet with new physical layers (e.g. new optical 
   physical layers, new copper physical layers, EPON), or as adding new 
   common functionality applicable to many Ethernet physical layers 
   (e.g. OAM).   
    
   This memo focuses on the management extensions to the MIB for 
   Ethernet-like interfaces to address the new common Ethernet 
   functionality developed in IEEE P802.3ah.  Other documents will 
   focus on detailed MIB extensions for new physical layers where 
   applicable.   
     
    
4  MIB Structure 
    
   The common EFM MIB objects of this memo focus on the OAM 
   capabilities introduced in IEEE P802.3ah.  The MIB objects are 
   partitioned into four (4) different MIB groups. 
    
   The dot3OamTable group manages the primary OAM objects of the 
   Ethernet interface.  This group controls the state and status of OAM 
   as well as the mode in which it operates.   
  
                                                              [Page 2]



                  draft-squire-hubmib-efm-mib-00.txt      October 2003 
 
 
   The dot3OamStats table maintains statistics on the number and type 
   of Ethernet OAM frames being transmitted and received on the 
   Ethernet interface. 
    
   The dot3OamPeer table maintains the current information on the 
   status and configuration of the peer OAM entity on the Ethernet 
   interface.  Managed information includes the capabilities and 
   function available on the peer OAM entity.   
    
   The dot3OamEvent table defines the management objects for the event 
   notification capability available in IEEE P802.3ah OAM.  With IEEE 
   P802.3ah OAM, one device may send notifications to its peer devices 
   whenever an important event happens on the local device.
