1.  Introduction

   Remote attestation describes the attempt to determine the integrity
   and trustworthiness of a computing platform or device without direct
   access.  One way to do so is based on measurements of software



Fuchs, et al.          Expires September 22, 2016               [Page 2]

Internet-Draft                    tuda                        March 2016


   components, where the hash values of all started software components
   are stored (extended into) a Trust Anchor implemented as Hardware
   Security Module (such as TPM and similar) and reported via a
   signature over these measurements.  Protocols that facilitate these
   Trust Anchor based signatures in order to provide remote attestations
   are usually bi-directional protocols, where one entity sends a
   challenge that is included inside the response to ensure the
   recentness of the attestation information.

   In many contexts and scenarios it is not feasible to deploy bi-
   directional protocols, due to constraints in the underlying
   communication schemes.  Furthermore, many communication schemes do
   not have a notion of connection, which disallows the usage of
   connection context related state information.  These constraints may
   make it impossible to deploy challenge-response based schemes to
   achieve freshness of messages in security protocols.  Examples of
   these constrained environments include broadcast and multicast
   schemes such as automotive IEEE802.1p as well as communication models
   that do not maintain connection state over time, such as REST [REST]
   and SNMP [RFC3411].

   This document describes the protocol TUDA for remote attestation that
   works over uni-directional communication channels whilst still
   providing up-to-date information about the integrity and thereby
   trustworthiness of the attested device.  The information elements
   that are transported by TUDA are encoded in the Concise Binary Object
   Representation, CBOR [RFC7049].  In this specification, the
   composition of the CBOR data items that represent the information
   elements is described using the CBOR Data Definition Language, CDDL
   [I-D.greevenbosch-appsawg-cbor-cddl].

1.1.  Concept

   The protocols usually employed for Remote Attestations using the
   Trusted Platform Module (TPM) - such as the Platform Trust Service
   (PTS) Protocol [PTS] - as specified by the Trusted Computing Group
   (TCG) are based upon the TPM_Quote() function.  It consists of the
   sending of a nonce-challenge that is then used within TPM_Quote()'s
   signature to prove the freshness of the Attestation response.  This
   scheme requires bi-directional communication.

   The TUDA protocol specification describes a new scheme for remote
   attestations based upon a combination of TPM_CertifyInfo() and
   TPM_TickStampBlob() to implement a time-based attestation scheme.The
   approach is based upon the work described in [MTAF] and [SFKE2008].

   The freshness properties of a challenge-response based protocol
   define the time-frame between the transmission of the nonce and the



Fuchs, et al.          Expires September 22, 2016               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                    tuda                        March 2016


   reception of the response as the point in time of attestation.  Given
   the time-based attestation scheme, the point in time of attestation
   lies within the time-frame given by the accuracy of the time-
   synchronization and the drift of clocks.  If the point in time is
   within the range of the typical round-trip of a challenge response
   attestation, the freshness property of TUDA is equivalent to that of
   classic challenge response attestation.  Even if the typical round-
   trip time is exceeded slightly, the TUDA attestation statements
   provide sufficiently fresh proofs for most scenarios.

   In contrast to classical attestations, TUDA attestations can serve as
   proof of integrity in audit logs with point in time guarantees.
   Also, it can be used via uni-directional and connection-less
   communication channels.

   Appendix A contains a realization of TUDA using TPM 1.2 primitives.
   A realization of TUDA using TPM 2.0 primitives will be added with the
   next iteration of this document.

1.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119, BCP 14 [RFC2119].

   This specification makes use of the terminology defined in [RFC4949]
   and uses CDDL as defined in [I-D.greevenbosch-appsawg-cbor-cddl] to
   define the composition of the TUDA information elements.

   The data structures defined by this protocol specification (for use
   by other specifications) introduce TUDA-specific terminology:

   tuda = [TUDA-Synctoken, TUDA-Verifytoken, TUDA-RestrictionInfo,
           TUDA-Cert, TUDA-Measurement-Log]

   Common types used in these are:

   Cert = bytes ; an X.509 certificate

   PCR-Hash = Hash
   Hash = bytes

   The roles used in the TUDA protocol are:

   Attestee:  the endpoint that is the subject of the attestation to
      another endpoint.




Fuchs, et al.          Expires September 22, 2016               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                    tuda                        March 2016


   Verifier:  the endpoint that consumes the attestation of another
      endpoint.

   TSA:  Time Stamp Authority [RFC3161].

   Types of certificates that are essential to the TUDA protocol:

   TSA-CA:  a Certificate Authority, that provides the certificate for
      the TSA.

   AIK-CA:  The Attestation Identity Key (AIK) is a special key type
      used within TPMs for identity-related operations (such as
      TPM_Certify or TPM_Quote).  Such an AIK can be established in many
      ways, using either a combination of TPM_MakeIdentity and
      TPM_ActivateIdentity with a so-called PrivacyCA [AIK-Enrollment]
      or by means of TPM_CreateWrapKey, readout in a secure environment
      and regular certification by a custom CA similar to IDevIDs or
      LDevIDs in [IEEE802.1AR].  AIK-CA is a placeholder for any CA and
      AIK-Cert is a placeholder for the corresponding Certificate,
      depending on what protocol was used.  The specific protocols are
      out of scope for this document.

   Terms that are commonly used in this document and not necessarily
   self-explaining:

   PCR:  a Platform Configuration Register that is part of a Trusted
      Platform Module and is used to securely store and report
      measurements about security posture.

   In this specification, the term "byte" is used in its now customary
   sense as a synonym for "octet".

2.  Time-Based Uni-Directional Attestation

   A Time-Based Uni-Directional Attestation (TUDA) consists of the
   following seven information elements.  They are used to gain
   assurance of the Attestee's platform configuration at a certain point
   in time:

   o  TSA Certificate

      The certificate of the Time Stamp Authority that is used in a
      subsequent synchronization protocol token.  This certificate is
      signed by the TSA-CA.

   o  AIK Certificate ([AIK-Credential], [AIK-Enrollment]; see
      Appendix A.2.1).




Fuchs, et al.          Expires September 22, 2016               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                    tuda                        March 2016


      A certificate about the Attestation Identity Key (AIK) used.  This
      may or may not also be an [IEEE802.1AR] IDevID or LDevID,
      depending on their setting of the corresponding identity property.

   o  Synchronization Token

      The reference for Attestations are the Tick-Sessions of the TPM.
      In order to put Attestations into relation with a Real Time Clock
      (RTC), it is necessary to provide a cryptographic synchronization
      between the tick session and the RTC.  To do so, a synchronization
      protocol is run with a Time Stamp Authority (TSA).

   o  Restriction Info

      The attestation relies on the capability of the TPM to operate on
      restricted keys.  Whenever the PCR values for the machine to be
      attested change, a new restricted key is created that can only be
      operated as long as the PCRs remain in their current state.

      In order to prove to the Verifier that this restricted temporary
      key actually has these properties and also to provide the PCR
      value that it is restricted, the TPM command TPM_CertifyInfo is
      used.  It creates a signed certificate using the AIK about the
      newly created restricted key.

   o  Measurement Log

      Similarly to regular attestations, the Verifier needs a way to
      reconstruct the PCRs' values in order to estimate the
      trustworthiness of the device.  As such, a list of those elements
      that were extended into the PCRs is reported.  Note though that
      for certain environments, this step may be optional if a list of
      valid PCR configurations exists and no measurement log is
      required.

   o  Implicit Attestation

      The actual attestation is then based upon a TPM_TickStampBlob
      operation using the restricted temporary key that was certified in
      the steps above.  The TPM_TickStampBlob is executed and thereby
      provides evidence that at this point in time (with respect to the
      TPM internal tick-session) a certain configuration existed (namely
      the PCR values associated with the restricted key).  Together with
      the synchronization token this tick-related timing can then be
      related to the real-time clock.

   o  Concise SWID tags




Fuchs, et al.          Expires September 22, 2016               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                    tuda                        March 2016


      As an option to better assess the trustworthiness of an Attestee,
      a Verifier can request the reference hashes (often referred to as
      golden measurements) of all started software components to compare
      them with the entries in the measurement log.  References hashes
      regarding installed (and therefore running) software can be
      provided by the manufacturer via SWID tags.  SWID tags are
      provided by the Attestee using the Concise SWID representation
      [I-D-birkholz-sacm-coswid] and bundled into a CBOR array.
      Ideally, the reference hashes include a signature created by the
      manufacturer of the software.

   These information elements could be sent en bloc, but it is
   recommended to retrieve them separately to save bandwidth, since
   these elements have different update cycles.  In most cases,
   retransmitting all seven information elements would result in
   unnecessary redundancy.

   Furthermore, in some scenarios it might be feasible not to store all
   elements on the Attestee endpoint, but instead they could be
   retrieved from another location or pre-deployed to the Verifier.  It
   is also feasible to only store public keys at the Verifier and skip
   the whole certificate provisioning completely in order to save
   bandwidth and computation time for certificate verification.

2.1.  TUDA Information Elements Update Cycles

   An endpoint can be in various states and have various information
   associated with it during its life cycle.  For TUDA, a subset of the
   states (which can include associated information) that an endpoint
   and its TPM can be in, is important to the attestation process.

   o  Some states are persistent, even after reboot.  This includes
      certificates that are associated with the endpoint itself or with
      services it relies on.

   o  Some states are more volatile and change at the beginning of each
      boot cycle.  This includes the TPM-internal Tick-Session which
      provides the basis for the synchronization token and implicit
      attestation.

   o  Some states are even more volatile and change during an uptime
      cycle (the period of time an endpoint is powered on, starting with
      its boot).  This includes the content of PCRs of a TPM and thereby
      also the PCR-restricted keys used during attestation.

   Depending on this "lifetime of state", data has to be transported
   over the wire, or not.  E.g. information that does not change due to




Fuchs, et al.          Expires September 22, 2016               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                    tuda                        March 2016


   a reboot typically has to be transported only once between the
   Attestee and the Verifier.

   There are three kinds of events that require a renewed attestation:

   o  The Attestee completes a boot-cycle

   o  A relevant PCR changes

   o  Too much time has passed since the last attestation statement

   The third event listed above is variable per application use case and
   can therefore be set appropriately.  For usage scenarios, in which
   the device would periodically push information to be used in an
   audit-log, a time-frame of approximately one update per minute should
   be sufficient in most cases.  For those usage scenarios, where
   verifiers request (pull) a fresh attestation statement, an
   implementation could use the TPM continuously to always present the
   most freshly created results.  To save some utilization of the TPM
   for other purposes, however, a time-frame of once per ten seconds is
   recommended, which would leave 80% of utilization for applications.

3.  REST Realization

   Each of the seven data items is defined as a media type (Section 5).
   Representations of resources for each of these media types can be
   retrieved from URIs that are defined by the respective servers
   [RFC7320].  As can be derived from the URI, the actual retrieval is
   via one of the HTTPs ([RFC7230], [RFC7540]) or CoAP [RFC7252].  How a
   client obtains these URIs is dependent on the application; e.g., CoRE
   Web links [RFC6690] can be used to obtain the relevant URIs from the
   self-description of a server, or they could be prescribed by a
   RESTCONF data model [I-D.ietf-netconf-restconf].

4.  SNMP Realization

   SNMPv3 [STD62] [RFC3411] is widely available on computers and also
   constrained devices.  To transport the TUDA information elements, an
   SNMP MIB is defined below which encodes each of the seven TUDA
   information elements into a table.  Each row in a table contains a
   single read-only columnar SNMP object of datatype OCTET-STRING.  The
   values of a set of rows in each table can be concatenated to

Internet-Draft                    tuda                        March 2016


   reconstitute a CBOR-encoded TUDA information element.  The Verifier
   can retrieve the values for each CBOR fragment by using SNMP GetNext
   requests to "walk" each table and can decode each of the CBOR-encoded
   data items based on the corresponding CDDL
   [I-D.greevenbosch-appsawg-cbor-cddl] definition.

   Design Principles:

   1.  Over time, TUDA attestation values age and should no longer be
       used.  Every table in the TUDA MIB has a primary index with the
       value of a separate scalar cycle counter object that
       disambiguates the transition from one attestation cycle to the
       next.

   2.  Over time, the measurement log information (for example) may grow
       large.  Therefore, read-only cycle counter scalar objects in all
       TUDA MIB object groups facilitate more efficient access with SNMP
       GetNext requests.

   3.  Notifications are supported by an SNMP trap definition with all
       of the cycle counters as bindings, to alert a Verifier that a new
       attestation cycle has occurred (e.g., synchronization data,
       measurement log, etc. have been updated by adding new rows and
       possibly deleting old rows).

4.1.  Structure of TUDA MIB

   The following table summarizes the object groups, tables and their
   indexes, and conformance requirements for the TUDA MIB:

   |-------------|-------|----------|----------|----------|
   | Group/Table | Cycle | Instance | Fragment | Required |
   |-------------|-------|----------|----------|----------|
   | General     |       |          |          | x        |
   | AIKCert     | x     | x        | x        |          |
   | TSACert     | x     | x        | x        |          |
   | SyncToken   | x     |          | x        | x        |
   | Restrict    | x     |          |          | x        |
   | Measure     | x     | x        |          |          |
   | VerifyToken | x     |          |          | x        |
   | SWIDTag     | x     | x        | x        |          |
   |-------------|-------|----------|----------|----------|

4.1.1.  Cycle Index

   A tudaV1<Group>CycleIndex is the:

Internet-Draft                    tuda                        March 2016


   1.  first index of a row (element instance or element fragment) in
       the tudaV1<Group>Table;

   2.  identifier of an update cycle on the table, when rows were added
       and/or deleted from the table (bounded by tudaV1<Group>Cycles);
       and

   3.  binding in the tudaV1TrapV2Cycles notification for directed
       polling.

4.1.2.  Instance Index

   A tudaV1<Group>InstanceIndex is the:

   1.  second index of a row (element instance or element fragment) in
       the tudaV1<Group>Table; except for

   2.  a row in the tudaV1SyncTokenTable (that has only one instance per
       cycle).

4.1.3.  Fragment Index

   A tudaV1<Group>FragmentIndex is the:

   1.  last index of a row (always an element fragment) in the
       tudaV1<Group>Table; and

   2.  accomodation for SNMP transport mapping restrictions for large
       string elements that require fragmentation.

4.2.  Relationship to Host Resources MIB

   The General group in the TUDA MIB is analogous to the System group in
   the Host Resources MIB [RFC2790] and provides context information for
   the TUDA attestation process.

   The Verify Token group in the TUDA MIB is analogous to the Device
   group in the Host MIB and represents the verifiable state of a TPM
   device and its associated system.

   The SWID Tag group (containing a Concise SWID reference hash profile
   [I-D-birkholz-sacm-coswid]) in the TUDA MIB is analogous to the
   Software Installed and Software Running groups in the Host Resources
   MIB [RFC2790].

4.3.  Relationship to Entity MIB

   The General group in the TUDA MIB is analogous to the Entity General
   group in the Entity MIB v4 [RFC6933] and provides context information
   for the TUDA attestation process.

   The SWID Tag group in the TUDA MIB is analogous to the Entity Logical
   group in the Entity MIB v4 [RFC6933].

4.4.  Relationship to Other MIBs

   The General group in the TUDA MIB is analogous to the System group in
   MIB-II [RFC1213] and the System group in the SNMPv2 MIB [RFC3418] and
   provides context information for the TUDA attestation process.

Appendix A.  Realization with TPM 1.2 functions

A.1.  TPM Functions

   The following TPM structures, resources and functions are used within
   this approach.  They are based upon the TPM 1.2 specification
   [TPM12].

A.1.1.  Tick-Session and Tick-Stamp

   On every boot, the TPM initializes a new Tick-Session.  Such a tick-
   session consists of a nonce that is randomly created upon each boot
   to identify the current boot-cycle - the phase between boot-time of



Fuchs, et al.          Expires September 22, 2016              [Page 30]

Internet-Draft                    tuda                        March 2016


   the device and shutdown or power-off - and prevent replaying of old
   tick-session values.  The TPM uses its internal entropy source that
   guarantees virtually no collisions of the nonce values between two of
   such boot cycles.

   It further includes an internal timer that is being initialize to
   Zero on each reboot.  From this point on, the TPM increments this
   timer continuously based upon its internal secure clocking
   information until the device is powered down or set to sleep.  By its
   hardware design, the TPM will detect attacks on any of those
   properties.

   The TPM offers the function TPM_TickStampBlob, which allows the TPM
   to create a signature over the current tick-session and two
   externally provided input values.  These input values are designed to
   serve as a nonce and as payload data to be included in a
   TickStampBlob: TickstampBlob := sig(TPM-key, currentTicks || nonce ||
   externalData).

   As a result, one is able to proof that at a certain point in time
   (relative to the tick-session) after the provisioning of a certain
   nonce, some certain externalData was known and provided to the TPM.
   If an approach however requires no input values or only one input
   value (such as the use in this document) the input values can be set
   to well-known value.  The convention used within TCG specifications
   and within this document is to use twenty bytes of zero
   h'0000000000000000000000000000000000000000' as well-known value.

A.1.2.  Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs)

   The TPM is a secure cryptoprocessor that provides the ability to
   store measurements and metrics about an endpoint's configuration and
   state in a secure, tamper-proof environment.  Each of these security
   relevant metrics can be stored in a volatile Platform Configuration
   Register (PCR) inside the TPM.  These measurements can be conducted
   at any point in time, ranging from an initial BIOS boot-up sequence
   to measurements taken after hundreds of hours of uptime.

   The initial measurement is triggered by the Platforms so-called pre-
   BIOS or ROM-code.  It will conduct a measurement of the first
   loadable pieces of code; i.e.\ the BIOS.  The BIOS will in turn
   measure its Option ROMs and the BootLoader, which measures the OS-
   Kernel, which in turn measures its applications.  This describes a
   so-called measurement chain.  This typically gets recorded in a so-
   called measurement log, such that the values of the PCRs can be
   reconstructed from the individual measurements for validation.

Internet-Draft                    tuda                        March 2016


   Via its PCRs, a TPM provides a Root of Trust that can, for example,
   support secure boot or remote attestation.  The attestation of an
   endpoint's identity or security posture is based on the content of an
   TPM's PCRs (platform integrity measurements).

A.1.3.  PCR restricted Keys

   Every key inside the TPM can be restricted in such a way that it can
   only be used if a certain set of PCRs are in a predetermined state.
   For key creation the desired state for PCRs are defined via the
   PCRInfo field inside the keyInfo parameter.  Whenever an operation
   using this key is performed, the TPM first checks whether the PCRs
   are in the correct state.  Otherwise the operation is denied by the
   TPM.

A.1.4.  CertifyInfo

   The TPM offers a command to certify the properties of a key by means
   of a signature using another key.  This includes especially the
   keyInfo which in turn includes the PCRInfo information used during
   key creation.  This way, a third party can be assured about the fact
   that a key is only usable if the PCRs are in a certain state.

A.2.  Protocol and Procedure

A.2.1.  AIK and AIK Certificate

   Attestations are based upon a cryptographic signature performed by
   the TPM using a so-called Attestation Identity Key (AIK).  An AIK has
   the properties that it cannot be exported from a TPM and is used for
   attestations.  Trust in the AIK is established by an X.509
   Certificate emitted by a Certificate Authority.  The AIK certificate
   is either provided directly or via a so-called PrivacyCA
   [AIK-Enrollment].

   This element consists of the AIK certificate that includes the AIK's
   public key used during verification as well as the certificate chain
   up to the Root CA for validation of the AIK certificate itself.

   TUDA-Cert = [AIK-Cert, TSA-Cert]; maybe split into two for SNMP
   AIK-Cert = Cert
   TSA-Cert = Cert

                    Figure 2: TUDA-Cert element in CDDL

   The TSA-Cert is a standard certificate of the TSA.

Internet-Draft                    tuda                        March 2016


   The AIK-Cert may be provisioned in a secure environment using
   standard means or it may follow the PrivacyCA protocols.  Figure 3
   gives a rough sketch of this protocol.  See [AIK-Enrollment] for more
   information.

   The X.509 Certificate is built from the AIK public key and the
   corresponding PKCS #7 certificate chain, as shown in Figure 3.

   | create_AIK_Cert(...) = {
   |   AIK = TPM_MakeIdentity()
   |   IdReq = CollateIdentityRequest(AIK,EK)
   |   IdRes = Call(AIK-CA, IdReq)
   |   AIK-Cert = TPM_ActivateIdentity(AIK, IdRes)
   | }
   |
   | /* Alternative */
   |
   | create_AIK_Cert(...) = {
   |   AIK = TPM_CreateWrapKey(Identity)
   |   AIK-Cert = Call(AIK-CA, AIK.pubkey)
   | }

                 Figure 3: Creating the TUDA-Cert element

A.2.2.  Synchronization Token

   The reference for Attestations are the Tick-Sessions of the TPM.  In
   order to put Attestations into relation with a Real Time Clock (RTC),
   it is necessary to provide a cryptographic synchronization between
   the tick session and the RTC.  To do so, a synchronization protocol
   is run with a Time Stamp Authority (TSA) that consists of three
   steps:

   o  The TPM creates a TickStampBlob using the AIK

   o  This TickstampBlob is used as nonce to the Timestamp of the TSA

   o  Another TickStampBlob with the AIK is created using the TSA's
      Timestamp a nonce

   The first TickStampBlob is called "left" and the second "right" in a
   reference to their position on a time-axis.

   These three elements, with the TSA's certificate factored out, form
   the synchronization token

A.2.3.  RestrictionInfo

   The attestation relies on the capability of the TPM to operate on
   restricted keys.  Whenever the PCR values for the machine to be
   attested change, a new restricted key is created that can only be
   operated as long as the PCRs remain in their current state.

   In order to prove to the Verifier that this restricted temporary key
   actually has these properties and also to provide the PCR value that
   it is restricted, the TPM command TPM_CertifyInfo is used.  It
   creates a signed certificate using the AIK about the newly created
   restricted key.

   This token is formed from the list of:

   o  PCR list,

   o  the newly created restricted public key, and

   o  the certificate.

A.2.4.  Measurement Log

   Similarly to regular attestations, the Verifier needs a way to
   reconstruct the PCRs' values in order to estimate the trustworthiness
   of the device.  As such, a list of those elements that were extended
   into the PCRs is reported.  Note though that for certain
   environments, this step may be optional if a list of valid PCR
   configurations exists and no measurement log is required.

   TUDA-Measurement-Log = [*PCR-Event]
   PCR-Event = [
     type: PCR-Event-Type,
     pcr: uint,
     template-hash: PCR-Hash,
     filedata-hash: tagged-hash,
     pathname: text; called filename-hint in ima (non-ng)
   ]

   PCR-Event-Type = &(
     bios: 0
     ima: 1
     ima-ng: 2
   )

A.2.5.  Implicit Attestation

   The actual attestation is then based upon a TickStampBlob using the
   restricted temporary key that was certified in the steps above.  The
   TPM-Tickstamp is executed and thereby provides evidence that at this
   point in time (with respect to the TPM internal tick-session) a
   certain configuration existed (namely the PCR values associated with
   the restricted key).  Together with the synchronization token this
   tick-related timing can then be related to the real-time clock.

   This element consists only of the TPM_TickStampBlock with no nonce.

   TUDA-Verifytoken = TickStampBlob-Output

   Required TPM functions:

   |     keyHandle = restrictedKey_Handle,     /*TPM_KEY_HANDLE*/
   |     antiReplay = dummyNonce,              /*TPM_NONCE*/
   |     digestToStamp = dummyDigest)          /*TPM_DIGEST*/

A.2.6.  Attestation Verification Approach

   The seven TUDA information elements transport the essential content
   that is required to enable verification of the attestation statement
   at the Verifier.  The following listings illustrate the verification
   algorithm to be used at the Verifier in pseudocode.  The pseudocode
   provided covers the entire verification task.  If only a subset of
   TUDA elements changed (see Section 2.1), only the corresponding code
   listings need to be re-executed.

   | TSA_pub = verifyCert(TSA-CA, Cert.TSA-Cert)
   | AIK_pub = verifyCert(AIK-CA, Cert.AIK-Cert)

  | ts_left = Synctoken.left
  | ts_right = Synctoken.right
  |
  | /* Reconstruct ts_right's omitted values; Alternatively assert == */
  | ts_right.currentTicks.tickRate = ts_left.currentTicks.tickRate
  | ts_right.currentTicks.tickNonce = ts_left.currentTicks.tickNonce
  |
  | ticks_left = ts_left.currentTicks
  | ticks_right = ts_right.currentTicks
  |
  | /* Verify Signatures */
  | verifySig(AIK_pub, dummyNonce || dummyDigest || ticks_left)
  | verifySig(TSA_pub, hash(ts_left) || timestamp.time)
  | verifySig(AIK_pub, dummyNonce || hash(timestamp) || ticks_right)
  |
  | delta_left = timestamp.time -
  |     ticks_left.currentTicks * ticks_left.tickRate / 1000
  |
  | delta_right = timestamp.time -
  |     ticks_right.currentTicks * ticks_right.tickRate / 1000
