            SDP Offer/Answer for RTP using QUIC as Transport
                 draft-dawkins-avtcore-sdp-rtp-quic-00

Abstract

   This document describes these new SDP "proto" attribute values:
   "QUIC", "QUIC/RTP/SAVP", "QUIC/RTP/AVPF", and "QUIC/RTP/SAVPF", and
   describes how SDP Offer/Answer can be used to set up an RTP
   connection using QUIC as a transport protocol.

   These proto values are necessary to allow the use of QUIC as an
   underlying transport protocol for applications such as SIP and WebRTC
   that commonly use SDP as a session signaling protocol to set up RTP
   connections.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes these new SDP "proto" attribute values:
   "QUIC", "QUIC/RTP/SAVP", "QUIC/RTP/AVPF", and "QUIC/RTP/SAVPF", and
   describes how SDP Offer/Answer ([RFC3264]) can be used to set up an
   RTP ([RFC3550]) connection using QUIC ([RFC9000] and related
   specifications) as a transport protocol.

   These proto values are necessary to allow the use of QUIC as an
   underlying transport protocol for applications such as SIP
   ([RFC3261]) and WebRTC ([RFC8825]) that commonly use SDP as a session
   signaling protocol to set up RTP connections.

Internet-Draft          SDP O/A for RTP over QUIC           January 2022


   This document is intended for publication as a standards-track RFC in
   the IETF stream, but has not been adopted by any IETF working group,
   and does not carry any special status within the IETF.

1.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 ([RFC2119]) ([RFC8174]) when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.3.  Scope of this document

   This document focuses on the IANA registration and description of the
   RTP sessions using SDP Offer/Answer, as would be the case for many
   current RTP applications in common use, such as SIP ([RFC3261]) and
   WebRTC ([RFC8825]).

   This document is intended as complementary to drafts such as
   [I-D.engelbart-rtp-over-quic], which largely focus on RTP/RTCP
   encapsulation in QUIC, so that the SDP experts can focus on SDP
   offer/answer aspects, and the RTP experts can focus on RTP/RTCP
   encapsulation aspects.

1.4.  Contribution and Discussion Venues for this draft.

   (Note to RFC Editor - if this document ever reaches you, please
   remove this section)

   With the concurrence of the AVTCORE and MMUSIC working group co-
   chairs, this document should be discussed in the AVTCORE working
   group, in the same venue where RTP over QUIC proposals are being
   discussed.  When proposals for RTP over SIP have stablized in
   AVTCORE, this document will be sent to the MMUSIC working group for
   review by SDP experts, but SDP-specific comments are welcomed at any
   time.

   Readers are also invited to open issues and send pull requests with
   contributed text for this document in the GitHub repository at

1.5.  Assumptions for this document

   This document assumes that for RTP-over-QUIC, it is useful to
   register these AVP profiles using QUIC, in order to allow existing
   SIP and RTCWEB RTP applications to migrate more easily to QUIC:

   *  RTP/SAVP ("The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)"), as
      defined in [RFC3711].

   *  RTP/AVPF ("Extended RTP Profile for Real-time Transport Control
      Protocol (RTCP)-Based Feedback (RTP/AVPF)"), as defined in
      [RFC4585].

   *  RTP/SAVPF ("Extended Secure RTP Profile for Real-time Transport
      Control Protocol (RTCP)-Based Feedback (RTP/SAVPF)"), as defined
      in [RFC5124].

   This document assumes that any implementation adding support for RTP-
   over-QUIC could reasonably also add support for BUNDLE ([RFC8843])
   and "rtcp-mux" ([RFC5761]), so these capabiilities are not mentioned
   further in this document.

1.5.1.  An Aside on Secure AVP Profiles in an RTP Over QUIC Context

   Existing RTP implementations have the choice for any given RTP
   connection to exchange either unencrypted RTP streams (using AVP
   profiles such as RTP/AVPF) or encrypted RTP streams (using AVP
   profiles such as RTP/SAVPF).

   An RTP implementation that uses QUIC as its underlying transport
   protocol will always send an RTP stream that is encrypted between the
   two QUIC endpoints, so some RTP implementations may be tempted to
   exchange unencrypted RTP as an encrypted QUIC payload, reasoning that
   QUIC protection will be sufficient.

   One nuance here is that QUIC is heavily encrypted between two QUIC
   endpoints, with the very minimal exception of the invariant header
   fields described in [RFC8999], but as described in [RFC7667], many
   RTP applications use middleboxes for a variety of reasons, and some
   of these topologies (for example, media translation) require that the
   middlebox understand the RTP payload.

   These middleboxes are explictly addressed, and the QUIC cryptographic
   handshake described in [RFC9001] takes place between the RTP endpoint
   and the RTP middlebox.  After the QUIC cryptographic handshake has
   succeeded, the RTP middlebox has access to the RTP in the QUIC
   payload, and can perform whatever translations are appropriate before
   forwarding the RTP steam to another RTP endpoint.  However, if the

Internet-Draft          SDP O/A for RTP over QUIC           January 2022


   RTP sender uses one of the "insecure" AVPs, the middlebox does not
   have any indication that the RTP sender wants the translated RTP
   stream to be protected by encryption when the middlebox forwards it.
   That might be fine if the middlebox and RTP endpoint are both using
   RTP over QUIC, but if the middlebox is performing transport
   translation as well, the middlebox may also be translating an RTP-
   over-QUIC stream to RTP-over-UDP.

   This specification tries to provide that indication by supporting
   both "secure" and "insecure" AVPs for RTP over QUIC, so the middlebox
   that is providing back-to-back RTP sessions as described in [RFC7667]
   can be aware of the sender's desire that a translated RTP stream is
   encypted regardless of the underlying transport protocol, without
   always requiring both SRTP and QUIC encryption between each pair of
   QUIC endpoints for all RTP traffic.  That's one strategy, and it's
   certainly possible that other strategies might be safer, cleaner,
   and/or more useful.

1.6.  Open Questions

   The current contents of Section 2 and Section 3 would allow an
   existing RTP/RTCP implementation to make a relatively straightforward
   transition from "RTP over UDP" to "RTP over QUIC datagrams over UDP",
   and likewise from "RTCP over UDP" to "RTCP over QUIC datagrams over
   UDP".

   Although it is still early days for RTP over QUIC, things may not be
   that straightforward.  Just limiting our attention to various
   proposals for "RTP over QUIC" that have already been discussed on the
   Media Over QUIC IETF mailing list [MOQ] and in various IETF side
   meetings, we have seen

   *  a desire to make use of QUIC connection migration in case of path
      failure between two endpoints

   *  a desire to replace RTP Round Trip Time (RTT) measurement with
      something like a proposed QUIC extension for timestamps
      ([I-D.huitema-quic-ts]) that could be used to measure one-way
      delays

   *  a desire to make use of QUIC streams, potentially with QUIC
      datagrams in the same QUIC connection

   *  a desire to decouple the RTP state machine and the QUIC state
      machine, which currently assume they are solely responsible for
      managing sending rates, without any knowledge of what the other
      plans to do

Internet-Draft          SDP O/A for RTP over QUIC           January 2022


   *  a desire to select a media-focused congestion control mechanism
      such as "Self-Clocked Rate Adaptation for Multimedia", or SCReAM
      ([RFC8298]), that can be included in QUIC implementations

   *  a desire to use RTP over QUIC in peer-to-peer applications, which
      likely would require extensions to the QUIC protocol for NAT
      traversal, at a bare minimum

   Changes to the SDP signaling in Section 2 and Section 3 may be (and
   likely would be) needed in order to support any of these desires (or
   other desires that may surface in the future).

2.  Identifiers and Attributes

   As much as possible, these are reused from other specifications, with
   references to the original definitions.

2.1.  Protocol Identifiers

2.1.1.  The QUIC proto

   The 'QUIC' protocol identifier is similar to the 'UDP' and 'TCP'
   protocol identifiers in that it only describes the transport
   protocol, and not the upper-layer protocol.

   An 'm' line that specifies 'QUIC' MUST further qualify the
   application-layer protocol using an fmt identifier, such as
   "QUIC/RTP/AVPF".  Media described using an 'm' line containing the
   'QUIC' protocol identifier are carried using QUIC ([RFC9000]).

   The following is an update to the ABNF for an 'm' line, as specified
   by [RFC8866], that defines a new value for the QUIC protocol.

      media-field =         %s"m" "=" media SP port \["/" integer\]
                                SP proto 1*(SP fmt) CRLF

      <fmt>:                   (unchanged from {{RFC8866}})

2.1.2.  The QUIC/RTP/SAVP proto

   The following is an update to the ABNF for an 'm' line, as specified
   by [RFC8866], that defines a new value for the QUIC/RTP/SAVP
   protocol.

   protocol.

   protocol.

      media-field =         %s"m" "=" media SP port \["/" integer\]

   This example is largely based on an example appearing in [RFC8866],
   Section 5, but is using QUIC/RTP/AVPF to support a newer codec.

   Because QUIC uses connections for both streams and datagrams, we are
   reusing two session- and media-level SDP attributes from
   [SDP-attribute-name] that were defined in [RFC4145] for use with TCP:
   setup and connection.

   This example SDP offer might be included in a SIP Invite.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers these protocols in the proto registry
   ([SDP-parameters]).

   *  QUIC (Section 2.1.1)

   *  QUIC/RTP/SAVP (Section 2.1.2)

   *  QUIC/RTP/AVPF (Section 2.1.3)

   *  QUIC/RTP/SAVPF (Section 2.1.4)

3.1.  Proto Registrations

   IANA is requested to add these protocols to the Session Description
