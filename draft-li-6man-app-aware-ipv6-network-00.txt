                draft-li-6man-app-aware-ipv6-network-00

Abstract

   A multitude of applications are carried over the network, which have
   varying needs for network bandwidth, latency, jitter, and packet
   loss, etc.  Some applications such as online gaming and live video
   streaming have very demanding network requirements thereof require
   special treatments in the network.  However, in current networks, the
   network and applications are decoupled, that is, the network is not
   aware of the applications' requirements in a finer granularity.
   Therefore, it is difficult to provide truly fine-granular traffic
   operations for the applications and guarantee their SLA requirements.

   This document proposes a new framework, named Application-aware IPv6
   Networking, and also the solution to guarantee SLA for applications,
   which makes use of IPv6 extensions header in order to convey the
   application related information including its requirements along with
   the packet to the network so to facilitate the service deployment and
   network resources adjustment.  Then, it defines the application-aware
   options which can be used in the different IPv6 extension headers for
   the purpose.

1.  Introduction

   A multitude of applications are carried over the network, which have
   varying needs for network bandwidth, latency, jitter, and packet
   loss, etc.  Some applications such as online gaming and live video
   streaming have very demanding network requirements thereof require
   special treatments in the network.  However, in current networks, the
   network and applications are decoupled, that is, the network is not
   aware of the applications' requirements in a finer granularity.
   Therefore, it is difficult to provide truly fine-granular traffic
   operations for the applications and guarantee their SLA requirements.
   Such guarantee would also be provided by adopting the hierarchical
   orchestration and the interactions between the orchestrator and
   multiple controllers, but it would take a very long time by going
   through the control and management elements.  Moreover, the
   interfaces between those elements require standardizations.

   This document proposes a new framework, named Application-aware IPv6
   Networking, and also the solution to guarantee SLA for applications,
   which makes use of IPv6 extensions header (i.e.  Hop-by-Hop Options
   Header (HBH), Destination Options Header (DOH), Segment Routing
   Header(SRH)) to convey the applications related information including
   their identifiers and requirements along with the packet to the
   network to facilitate the service deployment and network resource
   adjustment.  Then it defines the application-aware options (i.e.
   application-aware ID option and service-aware para option), which can
   be used in the above listed different IPv6 extension headers for the
   purpose.

3.  Demanding Applications

   This section shows the various demanding requirements of some
   applications.  The traffic of these applications needs to be
   differentiated from other types of traffic and applied with special
   treatments in the network, that is, the network needs to be able to
   provide fine-granular traffic operations and acceleration to these
   demanding applications.  In return, the operators will get their
   networks' revenue increased.

3.1.  Online Gaming

   Good network performance is normally a prerequisite for satisfactory
   game play, especially for the online gaming.  Shooting or racing
   online gaming is normally based on quick action and needs to update
   the game status in real time by continuously sending and receiving
   updates to/from the game server and/or other players.  The online
   gaming is very sensitive to the network latency.

3.2.  Video streaming

   The network latency, jitter, bandwidth, and packet loss are the key
   factors for the video streaming.  Live video streaming has even more
   strict requirements.  High quality video source require more
   bandwidth in order to stream properly.  Real time streaming services
   also require real time content delivery from the web server to the
   end user ideally via carefully planned explicit TE paths.  The online
   gaming often involves live video streaming.

4.  Problem Statement

   [RFC3272] reviews a number of IETF activities which are primarily
   intended to evolve the IP architecture to support new service
   definitions which allow preferential or differentiated treatment to
   be accorded to certain types of traffic.  The challenge when using
   traditional ways to guarantee SLA is that the packets are not able to
   carry enough information of service requirements of applications.
   The network devices mainly rely on the 5-tuple of the packets which
   cannot provide fine-grained service process.  If more information is
   needed, it has to refer to DPI which will introduce more cost in the
   network and impose security challenges.

   In the era of SDN the orchestrator is introduced for the
   orchestration of applications and the network.  The SDN controller
   can be aware of the service requirements of the applications on the
   network through the interface interworking with the orchestrator.
   The service requirements is used by the controller for traffic
   management.  The method raises the following problems: 1) The whole

   loop is long and time-consuming which is not suitable for the real-
   time adjustment for applications; 2) Too many interfaces are involved
   in the loop which proposes more challenges of standardization and
   inter-operability, and it is difficult to be standardized for easy
   interworking.

                          Figure 1 App-aware IPv6 Network

   In the application-aware IPv6 network shown in Figure 1, there are
   following components:

   1.  Application-aware Apps: The IPv6 enabled applications runs in the
   host which can optionally add the service requirements of the
   applications in an IPv6 extension header ([RFC8200]) or remove it
   from the IPv6 extension header.  The service requirement information
   includes:

   o  An IPv6 application-aware ID which identifies the IPv6 packets as
      part of the traffic flow belonging to a specific SLA
      level/Application/User;

   o  A set of parameters for the specific service such as bandwidth,
      delay, delay variation, packet loss ratio, etc.

   The service requirements will be processed by the IPv6 enabled nodes
   along the path or the SRv6
   ([I-D.filsfils-spring-srv6-network-programming]) nodes along the SRv6
   path.

   2.  App-aware Edge Device: The Edge Device can add the service
   requirements of the applications on network through the IPv6
   extension header on behalf of the IPv6 enabled applications or change
   the service requirements conveyed by the packets of the application-
   aware applications according to local policies which is out of the
   scope of this document.  The service requirements will be processed

   by the IPv6 enabled nodes along the path or the SRv6 enabled node
   along the SRv6 path which be programmed by the Edge Device.  The
   application information can also be encapsulated through L2
   encapsulation or some tunnel encapsulations appended to the packet
   depending on different application scenarios and device capability.

   3.  App-aware-process Head-End: The service requirements may be
   processed as a service path such as a SRv6 Policy path of SFC at the
   App-aware-process Head-End. The service requirements conveyed in the
   IPv6 packets can be mapped to an existing service path or an existing
   Policy which satisfies the specific requirement, trigger to set up
   the new service path by the Head-End, or trigger the global traffic
   adjustment by the controller according to the information provided by
   the network devices.  The process depends on the local policy which
   is out of the scope this document.  The application information
   conveyed by the packet received from the App-aware Edge Device can
   also be copied or be mapped to the out IPv6 extension header for
   further application-aware process.

   4.  App-aware-process Mid-Point: The Mid-Point provides the path
   service according to the service path set up by the Head-End which
   satisfies the service requirement conveyed by the IPv6 packets.  The
   Mid-Point may also adjust the resource locally to guarantee the
   service requirements depending on a specific policy and the
   applicaton-aware information conveyed by the packet.  Policy
   definitions and mechanisms are out of the scope of this document.

   5.  App-aware-process End-Point: The process of the specific service
   path will end at the End-Point.  The service requirements information
   can be removed at the End-Point or go on to be conveyed with the IPv6
   packets.

   In this way the network is able to be aware of the service
   requirements expressed by the applications explicitly.  According to
   the service requirement information carried in the IPv6 packets the
   network is able to adjust its resources fast in order to satisfy the
   service requirement of applications.  The flow-driven method also
   reduces the challenges of inter-operability and long control loop.

6.  Application-aware Options

   In order to support the Application-aware IPv6 networking, two
   application-aware options are defined:

   o  Application-aware ID option

   o  Service-Para Option

   Delay: This 24-bit field carries the delay requirements in
   microseconds, encoded as an integer value.  When set to the maximum
   value 16,777,215 (16.777215 sec), then the delay is at least that
   value and may be larger.  This value is the highest delay that can be
   tolerated.

   3.  Delay Variation Sub-TLV

   This Delay Variation Sub-TLV indicates the delay variation
   requirement of applications.  The format of this sub-TLV is shown in
   the following diagram:

7.  Locations for placing the Application-aware Options

   The Application-aware options can be placed in several locations in
   the IPv6 packet header depend upon the scenarios and implementation
   requirements.

7.1.  Hop-by-Hop Options Header (HBH)

   The application-aware options can be carried in the Hop-by-Hop
   Options Header as new options.  By using the HBH Options Header, the
   information carried can be read by every node along the path.
   However, the current processing of the HBH Options Header goes to the
   slow path, which will decrease the forwarding performance.
   Therefore, we propose a new enhanced HBH Options Header in [I-D.li-
   6man-enhanced-extension-header].

7.2.  Destination Options Header (DOH)

   The application-aware options can be carried in the Destination
   Options Header as new options.

7.3.  Segment Routing Header (SRH)

   The Application-aware options can be placed in the segment routing
   header (SRH), e.g., in the SRH TLV, the SID Arguments field, or the
   TAG field.

7.3.1.  SRH TLV

   The Application-aware options can be placed in the SRH TLV.

7.3.2.  SID Arguments Field

   The Application-aware ID option can be put in the SID Arguments
   field, which can be read by each node indicated by the SID in the SID
   list.

7.3.3.  SRH TAG field

   The Application-aware ID option can be put in the TAG field, which
   can be read by each node that processes the SRH.

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA maintains the registry for the Options and Sub-TLVs.

   Application-Para Option will require one new type code per sub-TLV
   defined in this document:
