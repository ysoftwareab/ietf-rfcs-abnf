1.  Introduction

   This document describes a series of questions which should be
   answered.  This document is intended to remain as a Internet Draft.

   The idea is that current and future Applicability statements will use
   the table of contents provided.  The goal is that all applicability
   statements will have to cover the listed items as a minimum.

1.1.  Relationship to other documents

   EDITORIAL: The following should appear in all applicability
   statements:

   ROLL has specified a set of routing protocols for Lossy and Low-
   resource Networks (LLN) [RFC6550].  This applicability text describes
   a subset of these protocols and the conditions which make the subset
   the correct choice.  The text recommends and motivates the
   accompanying parameter value ranges.  Multiple applicability domains
   are recognized including: Building and Home, and Advanced Metering
   Infrastructure.  The applicability domains distinguish themselves in
   the way they are operated, their performance requirements, and the
   most probable network structures.  Each applicability statement
   identifies the distinguishing properties according to a common set of
   subjects described in as many sections.

   A common set of security threats are described in
   [I-D.ietf-roll-security-threats].  The applicability statements
   complement the security threats document by describing preferred
   security settings and solutions within the applicability statement
   conditions.  This applicability statements may recommend more light
   weight security solutions and specify the conditions under which
   these solutions are appropriate.

1.2.  Requirements Language

   (RFC2119 reference)

1.3.  Terminology

   A reference to draft-ietf-roll-terminology is appropriate.  A
   reference to layer-2 specific terminology and/or inclusion of any
   terms that are normatively referenced is appropriate here.

1.4.  Required Reading

   References/Overview of requirements documents, both IETF and industry
   group.  (two pages maximum.  This text should be (very) technical,
   should be aimed at IETF *participants*, not industry group
   participants, and should explain this industries' specific issues)

1.5.  Out of scope requirements

   This should list other documents (if any) which deal with situations
   where things are not in scope for this document.

   (For instance, the AMI document tries to cover both line-powered
   urban metering networks, and energy-constrained metering networks,
   and also tries to deal with rural requirements.  This should be three
   or four documents, so this section should list the limits of what
   this document covers)

2.  Deployment Scenario

2.1.  Network Topologies

   describe a single scenario, with possibly multiple topologies that a
   single utility would employ.

2.2.  Traffic Characteristics

   Explain what kind of traffic is being transmitted, where it is
   initiated, and what kinds of protocols (CoAP, multicast, HTTPS, etc.)
   are being used.  Explain what assumptions are being made about
   authentication and authorization in those protocols.

2.2.1.  General

Internet-Draft             roll-applicatbility             November 2015


2.2.2.  Source-sink (SS) communication paradigm

2.2.3.  Publish-subscribe (PS, or pub/sub) communication paradigm

2.2.4.  Peer-to-peer (P2P) communication paradigm

2.2.5.  Peer-to-multipeer (P2MP) communication paradigm

2.2.6.  Additional considerations: Duocast and N-cast

2.2.7.  RPL applicability per communication paradigm

2.3.  Layer-2 applicability.

   Explain what layer-2 technologies this statement applies to, and if
   there are options, they should be listed generally here, and
   specifically in section 4.2.

3.  Using RPL to Meet Functional Requirements

   This should explain in general terms how RPL is going to be used in
   this network topology.  If trees that are multiple layers deep are
   expected, then this should be described so that the fan out is
   understood.  Some sample topologies (from simulations) should be
   explained, perhaps with images references from other publications.

   This section should tell an *implementer* in a lab, having a
   simulation tool or a building/city/etc. to use as a testbed, how to
   construct an LLN of sufficient complexity (but not too much) to
   validate an implementation.

4.  RPL Profile

   This section should list the various features of RPL plus other
   layers of the LLN, and how they will be used.

4.1.  RPL Features

4.1.1.  RPL Instances

4.1.2.  Storing vs. Non-Storing Mode

4.1.3.  DAO Policy

4.1.4.  Path Metrics

4.1.5.  Objective Function

4.1.6.  DODAG Repair

4.1.7.  Multicast

4.1.8.  Security

4.1.9.  P2P communications

4.1.10.  IPv6 address configuration

4.2.  Layer-2 features

4.2.1.  Specifics about layer-2

   this section should detail the specific layer-2 network technology
   that this document applies to.  A class of technologies is generally
   not acceptable.

4.2.2.  Services provided at layer-2

4.2.3.  6LowPAN options assumed.

4.2.4.  MLE and other things

4.3.  Recommended Configuration Defaults and Ranges

4.3.1.  Trickle Parameters

   This section is intended to document the specific value (or ranges)
   appropriate for this kind of deployment.  This includes trickle
   specific parameters such as those of RFC6550, section 8.3.1: Imin
   (DIOInternvalMin), Imax (DIOIntrevalDoublings), and k
   (DIORedundancyConstant).  While it is not necessary to hard code
   these parameters into RPL nodes, as they are announced as part of the
   DIO message, it is important for researchers who are trying to
   validate the convergence properties of the resulting deployment to
   understand what values have been selected.

4.3.2.  Other Parameters

   There are additional values which are present in the DODAG
   Configuration option.  The purpose of this section is to: a) document
   what values are configured, b) if a default value is used, if it is
   appropriate for this deployment.

Internet-Draft             roll-applicatbility             November 2015


   These values include: MaxRankIncrease, MinHopRankIncrease, the
   Objective Code Point to use, Default Lifetime, Lifetime Units...

   In addition, the kinds of metrics which will be used (RFC6551) needs
   to be specified.  If Objective Function 0 (RFC6552) is used, then it
   specifies a number of values, but also needs definitions of the
   stretch_of_rank, and rank_factor.

   If MRHOF (RFC6719) is used, then section 5 of this document requires
   selection of: MAX_LINK_METRIC, MAX_PATH_COST,
   PARENT_SWITCH_THRESHOLD, PARENT_SET_SIZE, and ALLOW_FLOATING_ROOT.

5.  MPL Profile

   This section should list the various features of MPL.  In considering
   the parameters, a number of questions come up:

   1)    What are the maximum and minimum 1-hop MPL router neighbours of
         all the MPL routers?

   2)    what is the arrival rate of new packets that need repetition in
         a MPL router

   3)    Is there a deadline associated with the packets

   4)    What is the shortest number of hops of the longest path between
         sources and destinations

   5)    What are the values of the MAC: back-off values, retries,
         buffer size.

   6)    What is the background load of other non MPL applications.

   7)    arrival probability of 1-hop packets

   As the corresponding design space is incredibly large, probably only
   a limited subset of the design space is viable.

   Here is an example scenario:

   o  5 neighbours

   o  once every 100 ms (rate at sources is once every 300-500 ms)

   o  yes, 200 ms

   o  5 hops, with mostly 1 hop

Internet-Draft             roll-applicatbility             November 2015


   o  no buffer, retry 1, back-off 2

   o  absent

   o  100-80%

   leading to k=3-5, Imin =30-70 ms, repeat = 2, Imax n/a.

   It is crital operational boundary conditions together with
   appropriate MPL parameter values are published in this applicability
   statements.  All applicability statements together may give a good
   hint which MPL parameters and boundary conditions to choose.

5.1.  Recommended Configuration Defaults and Ranges

5.1.1.  Trickle Parameters

5.1.1.1.  Imin

5.1.1.2.  Imax

5.1.2.  Other Parameters

5.1.2.1.  Hot Limit

6.  Manageability Considerations

7.  Security Considerations

7.1.  Security Considerations during initial deployment

   (This section explains how nodes get their initial trust anchors,
   initial network keys.  It explains if this happens at the factory, in
   a deployment truck, if it is done in the field, perhaps like
   http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/hipercom/SmartObjectSecurity/papers/
   CullenJennings.pdf)

7.2.  Security Considerations during incremental deployment

   (This section explains how that replaces a failed node takes on the
   dead nodes' identity, or not.  How are nodes retired.  How are nodes
   removed if they are compromised)

7.3.  Security Considerations for P2P uses

   (When layer-3 RPL security is used, P2P DODAGs are ephemeral, and may
   have different security needs.)
