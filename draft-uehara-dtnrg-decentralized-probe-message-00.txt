  The Message Format for Decentralized Probe Applications for Vehicles
           draft-uehara-dtnrg-decentralized-probe-message-00

Abstract

   (This document is a description of the decentralized viechle to
   viechle probe mechanism currently being prototyped.  The main purpose
   of disclosing this -00 document is to introduce the application idea
   and start discussion within the DTNRG.  Because of this, the current
   mechanism described in this docment does not conform to the protocols
   defined in the DTNRG at this moment.  The mechanism should be updated
   based on the discussion in this group.)

   This document describes the application message format used for the
   decentralized probe system for vehicles.  The probe system exchanges
   the application messages between vehicles using the transport
   protocol defined in the separate specification.

1.  Introduction

   Thanks to the the advance of the Internet and the wireless
   communication technology, it becomes possible to equip communication
   mechanisms for vehicles for various purposes, such as for safety
   applications, entertainment applications, and so on.  Recently,
   approaches utilizing the DTN (Delay Tolerant Network) technology for
   inter-vehicle communication are attracting people from both academy
   and industry.  One of the application of the approaches is
   decentralized probe system for traffic information.  It is considered
   that by combining the existing centralized approach for traffic
   monitoring and the proposed decentralized approach, more detailed
   information exchange is possible and wider area can be covered.  This
   document proposes a standard message format for the traffic
   information dissemination application, and proposes a reference
   message dissemination strategy.


2.  Application Behavior

2.1.  Message Generation/Storing/Forwarding

   The mechanism described in this document proposes a decentralized
   approach of message exchange for car traffic monitoring.  The similar
   purpose is of course provided by the ITS (Intelligent Transport
   System) framework with the centralized approach.  However, since such
   systems require a large amount of investment for the road side units
   and their management system, they are usually deployed only on
   highways and main lines of urban areas.  The decentralized approach
   is one way to extend the area of the ITS service coverage, because
   the decentralized mechanism does not need to build any road side
   units, and each vehicle autonomously organizes the transport
   information network.

   This document defines a general format of the message exchanged in
   the decentralized approach.  Each vehicle monitors its activity,
   creates a message that indicates the activity, and distribute the
   message to other vehicles nearby based on the dissemination strategy
   defined in Section 2.2.  A vehicle that receives messages from other
   vehicles stores the messages in its own message storage, and
   distribute again using the dissemination strategy specified in the
   message body.

   For example, in the traffic jam information distribution case, a
   vehicle periodically monitors its speed and detects a traffic jam
   based on a traffic jam detection algorithm.  Once a jam is detected,
   the vehicle creates a message with an application identifier that
   indicates it is a traffic jam detection application, and distributes

   the message.  Every message includes the time when the message is
   generated, the location where the message is created, the valid
   lifetime of the message, and the algorithm how/where to distribute
   the message.  The transport mechanism of the messages is defined in
   other document [decentralized-probe-transport].

   To avoid a malicious vehicle to inject faked messages, applications
   can sign the messages based on the identifier of the vehicle if
   necessary.  If the message validation procedure fails when a vehicle
   receives a message, the message is discarded.

2.2.  Dissemination Strategy

   The dissemination strategy determines how to distribute a message.
   This document only defines a simple round dissemination strategy.
   The more complicated strategy is also possible and will be defined in
   separate documents.

   The round-shape dissemination strategy specifies the destination
   location (with latitude/longitude values) and the distribution
   radius.

   If a vehicle receives a message (regardless of the value of the
   dissemination identifier), it first looks up the same message in its
   message storage.  A message can be identified by a node identifier,
   application identifier, and application sequence number.  If the same
   message has already been stored in the storage, the received message
   is just ignored and discarded.  If the message is not found in the
   storage, then the vehicle stores the received message.

   A vehicle periodically checks its message storage to find messages
   which lifetime are expired.  Any messages with expired lifetime are
   marked as deleted and removed when the amount of the free space of
   the storage becomes low.

   A message will not be re-distributed until the dissemination conceal
   period has passed since the time when the message was received or re-
   distributed previously to avoid too frequent message exchange.

   In the round-shape dissemination strategy, a vehicle compares its
   current location and the region specified in the dissemination
   parameter fields in the message.  If the current location is covered
   by the region specified, the vehicle distribute the message to other
   vehicles nearby.

   If the vehicle is out of the dissemination target region, the message
   is not distributed and kept in the storage.

3.  Message Format

   The application message consists of three parts.  Each part is
   concatenated in the order listed below and passed to the packet
   sender module.  The detailed description of the packet sender and
   receiver are found in [decentralized-probe-transport].

   The first part contains the basic information of the application
   message.  The second part contains the parameters for message
   dissemination strategy.  The final part contains the security
   information.

3.1.  Basic Information Part

   Figure 1 shows the basic information part of the message.
