         Prefix elements for Road and House Numbers in PIDF-LO
                      draft-ietf-geopriv-prefix-00

Abstract

   RFC4119 updated by RFC5139 defines suffixes for street names and
   house numbers, but does not define prefixes.  Both occur regularly in
   addresses and CAtypes are needed for them.  This memo defines STP
   Street Prefix and HNP house number prefix CAtypes.

Internet-Draft            Road and House Prefix             January 2010


1.  Terminology

   This document uses terminology described in [RFC4119].

1.1.  Introduction

   RFC4119 updated by RFC5139 defines suffixes for street names and
   house numbers, but does not define prefixes.  Both occur regularly in
   addresses and CAtypes are needed for them.  This memo defines STP
   Street Prefix and HNP house number prefix CAtypes.

1.2.  Prefixes in addressing

   In [RFC4119] one can define a PIDF for 123 Main Street but not 123
   Boulevard Coranado.  There is an STS CAtype for a suffix, but no
   corresponding prefix.  [RFC5139] added PRM Premodifier and POM
   Postmodifier, but those are not suitable for the purpose.

   Similarly, one can express 123B Main, but not H123 Main.  Although
   one can include such letters in the house number, most addressing
   authorities keep the number numeric only to facilitate sorting, and
   have prefix and suffix fields for alphanumerics that appear in front
   of or following the numeric house number.

   To remedy this situation, new CAtypes are required: STP for a street
   (road) prefix, and HNP for a house number prefix.

1.3.  Security Considerations

   The XML representation described in this document is designed for
   inclusion in a PIDF-LO document.  As such, it is subject to the same
   security considerations as are described in [RFC4119].
   Considerations relating to the inclusion of this representation in
   other XML documents are outside the scope of this document.

1.4.  IANA Considerations

   This document updates the civic address type registry established by
   [RFC4776].  Two additional value are added:

       41      STP    Street (Road) Prefix
       42      HNP    House Number Prefix
