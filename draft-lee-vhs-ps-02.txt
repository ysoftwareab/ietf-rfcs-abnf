               Problem Statements of Virtual Home Network
                          draft-lee-vhs-ps-02

Abstract

   Network Virtualization is proven a success to more effectively manage
   services in data center.  This draft states the motivations and
   problem statements of decoupling services from Customer Premises
   Equipment (CPE) and virtualizing them in the Network Service Provider
   (NSP).

1.  Home CPE

   In the early days of Internet era, most users used dial-up directly
   connecting to Internet from desktop Personal Computer (PC).  Network
   Service Provider (NSP) offered a single public IPv4 address to the
   dial-up (i.e., PPP) connection to the PC.  This model was revised
   when Internet and PC became more popular.  Multiple PCs would share a
   single NSP connection.  NSP wanted to preserve the model to offer
   only a single public IPv4 address per connection, NAT [RFC2663]
   enabled Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) was introduced in home
   network.  When days advance, NSP are offering more and more IP
   services (e.g., video, voice, home automation), NSPs must provide
   seamless support and excellent services to their users.  Today CPEs
   are doing more than just NAT-ing.  They may include but not limited
   to the following services:

   o  IPv4 NAT Services

   o  DHCPv4 Server Service

   o  Personal Firewall Services

   o  Parental Control Service

   o  Voice over IP (VoIP) Service

   o  Home Monitor Service

   o  Video Streaming Service

   o  DNS Proxy Service

2.  CPE Deployment Model

   Although the current CPE deployment model is a by-product of limited
   public IPv4 addresses, it is proven a successful model to serve
   users.  More importantly, in the past NSP network had limited service
   capacity in the network and the capacity wasn't growing as fast as
   the user demand.  NSP could offload and distribute their services to
   the CPE so that NSP can focus on growing bandwidth capacity.  With
   all the CPE's successes, there are also some drawbacks:

   o  No Uniform set of Services: There is no uniform set of services.
      CPE vendors can't build an one-for-all-NSP CPE.  Each NSP may
      offer slightly different set of services; hence, each NSP may
      develop its CPE specifications for CPE vendors to build.

   o  Service Variation: Even for a well defined service, each NSP may
      still have different requirements.  For example: NSP-A may use SIP
      for its VoIP and NSP-B may use WebRTC.

   o  CPE Manageability: When an NSP plan to offer a new service that is
      not compatible to the current CPE.  The NSP must update or upgrade
      the CPE.  Depending on the NSP subscription base, it could mean to
      update or upgrade thousands to millions of CPEs.

   Among all three, CPE manageability is particularly critical to NSP.

3.  Customizable Service

   The revolution of portable smart device and Internet-of-Thing has
   radically changed the service definition for NSP.  In the past, only
   personal computers were connected to the Internet.  NSP service model
   was to provide the best connectivity to a household.  Household
   members didn't usually carry multiple devices and didn't streaming HD
   videos to different type of devices, so the service model was
   providing best Internet connectivity for the entire household.  Fast
   forward to today, portable smart devices are personalized.  A typical
   user may carry 2 to 3 devices that are constantly connected to
   Internet.  Besides, many electronic devices such as sensors,
   monitoring systems, appliances and entertainment systems are all
   connected to the Internet.  These devices may have different service
   requirements.  Some may have strict latency requirement (e.g.  webcam
   and online gaming) and others may have strict bandwidth requirement
   (e.g.  high-definition video streaming).  These new requirements
   cause the NSP to rethink a pure connectivity service model to a

   customizable service model.  This requires the NSP to build a network
   that could identify packet flows and associated them to user profiles
   and apply proper policies to them.

   Since the IPv4 addresses are depleted, IPv6 emigration has finally
   started.  One major advantage of IPv6 is network transparency.  In
   IPv4, NSP and Content Service Provider (CSP) can't identify a device
   simply by examining just an IPv4 address because a public IPv4 may
   represent multiple devices behind NAT.  In IPv6, every device will
   have one or more Global Unicast IPv6 addresses (GUA).  This enables
   NSP and CSP to offer device and user specific services.  This
   inspires innovation in new end-to-end services.  For NSP, they may
   refine and evolve the current "heavy" CPE deployment model to speed
   up offering new services.

4.  Network Virtualization

   Software Defined Network (SDN) is originally designed to decouple
   network software functions from hardware.  Service designers can
   focus on service development without coupling to the underneath
   hardware architecture.  SDN provides a set of Application Programming
   Interface (API) for service designers to interact with the hardware
   for packet processing.  There are two critical criterion to make this
   concept possible: Fast network and Exponential growth of computation
   power in general purposed hardware.  Recently many NSPs have agreed
   that these two criterion are met with current technology.

   Network Function Virtualization (NFV) aims to define a framework to
   allow typical network functions such as NAT, firewall and QoS policy
   management running on Virtual Machine (VM).  NFV can combine with SDN
   and convert the traditional hardware centric networking architecture
   to more software centric networking architecture.  Many NSPs are
   seriously considering to apply the SDN and NFV concept to re-
   architect the core and edge network design.

5.  High-level Architecture

   Similar to classic SDN architecture, Virtual Home Network (VHN)
   includes a Controller (VHNC) that contains user configurations and
   policies and a Packet Processor (VHNF) that process packet
   forwarding.  Similar to class NFV architecture, VHN includes a set of
   Virtual Network Functions (VNF) and a VNF Manager (VNFM) managing the
   VNF.  Figure 1 shows the high-level VHN architecture.

   In Figure 1, it shows five interfaces.  Ia, Ib and Ic are interfaces
   for control protocols.  Id and Ie are data path specifications.

   o  Ia between the VHNC and the VHNF is used to exchange configuration
      and policy.  For example: User A's living room TV has Committed
      Information Rate (CIR) set at 10Mb/s and must be protected by
      firewall function implemented in VNF.

   o  Ib between the VHNC and VNFs is used to exchange configuration and
      policy For example: VHNC could configure the firewall VHF to block
      any incoming ICMP messages to the User A's living room TV.

   o  Ic between VNFM and VNFs is used to exchange VHN management
      messages.  For example: VNFM could instantiate a new firewall VNF
      when the current firewall VNF reached certain capacity.

   o  Id is the protocol agreed between CPE and VHNF.  It could be
      Ethernet or any encapsulation technology such as PMIP or MPLS.

   o  Ie is the Service Chaining Function protocol between VHNF and VNF.
      SFC WG is currently defining the specifications.

   VNF contains the service definitions and service logic.  For example:
   Virtual Network Function 1 (VNF1) could be a parental control service
   and manage web filter rules configured by subscriber.  Virtual
   Network Function 2 (VNF2) could be personal firewall that protects a
   home from botnet and intrusion.  NSP can scale VNFs horizontally to
   meet user demand.  NSP can also dynamically create VNF per subscriber
   only when the subscriber wants that service.  For example: NSP
   initiates VNF1 for User X and VNF2 for User Y.  In this model, NSP no
   longer updates CPE for service addition or modification.

   VHNC stores the user's service subscription.  Each user may have
   different set of home services.  For example: User A may have video
   service.  User B may have VoIP service.  VHNC contains the user's
   service subscription and interact with the VNF modules to provide
   proper services to users.

   VHNF is usually a networking device that is optimized for processing
   packet.  It is also implemented the Service Function Chain function
   to forward user packets to proper VNFs.

   CPE is a simple access device that connects to the subscriber's
   devices at home to the NSP network.

6.  Problem Statement

   Virtual Home Network enables NSP to offer service in a more rapid
   pace.  It also enables NSP to offer new possible services such as:

   1.  Connect a user mobile device to his home network at outdoor
       access point.

   2.  Provide more flexibility IPv4 and IPv6 address management.

   3.  Provide more granular QoS management.

   Section 5 describes the high-level architecture.  One possible
   deployment is to put the VHNC in a central location and put the VHNF
   closer to users.  This deployment requires to standardize the
   following:

   o  Service Definition: Define the service semantics and user
      interaction.  This allows the vendor community to standardize the
      service definition and build the Virtual Service model to support
      it.

   o  Ia: Define and specify the API to provision the user configuration
      parameters to the VHNF and Service Function Chain.

   o  Ib: Define and specify the API to provision service parameters to
      VNFs.

   o  Id: Define new header format to carry user id and device id in the
      packet.

   Standardizing the Service Definitions, Ia and Ib will simplify
   service integration and equipment interoperability.  This will help
   vendors to speed up development and NSP to speed up new service
   offering.
