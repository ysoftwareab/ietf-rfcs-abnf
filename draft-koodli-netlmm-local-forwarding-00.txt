Abstract

   With bidirectional tunneling in Proxy Mobile IPv6, the communication
   between any two Mobile Nodes is required to traverse the Local
   Mobility Anchor (LMA).  This is the case even when the communicating
   Mobile Nodes are attached to the same Mobility Anchor Gateway (MAG).
   This document introduces two messages between the LMA and the MAG
   enabling local forwarding by the MAG.  Such forwarding avoids the
   delay due to bidirectional forwarding, and reduces the traffic load
   on the LMA.

Internet-Draft              Local Forwarding                   July 2008


1.  Introduction

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 [pmipv6] describes the protocol operations to
   maintain reachability and session persistence for a Mobile Node (MN)
   without the explicit participation from the MN in signaling
   operations at the Internet Protocol (IP) layer.  In order to
   facilitate the network-based mobility, the PMIPv6 protocol defines a
   Mobility Anchor Gateway (MAG), which acts as a proxy for the Mobile
   IPv6 [rfc3775] signaling, and the Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) which
   acts similar to a Home Agent.  The LMA and the MAG estalish a
   bidirectional tunneling for forwarding all data traffic belonging to
   the Mobile Nodes.  This bidirectional tunneling is used even when the
   communicating MNs are attached to the same MAG, or are attached to
   two different MAGs in the same access network.  This method of
   forwarding always relies on the transport network (between the MAG
   and the LMA) which could be the bottleneck in terms of delay and
   cost.  Furthermore, distributing the load to the network periphery
   whenever feasible could also achieve load balancing within the PMIPv6
   network domain.

   This document provides a pair of messages between the LMA and the MAG
   to enable local forwarding of traffic without the involvement of LMA.
   The LMA sends a Local Forwarding Request (LFRQ) message to request a
   MAG to establish local forwarding for a pair of mobile nodes
   identified by their MN-Identifiers and Home Network Prefixes.  The
   MAG indicates the resolution of LFRQ message in the Local Forwarding
   Reply (LFRP) message, confirming local forwarding when it is able to
   establish Local Forwarding Entries.  Subsequently, all the traffic
   matching the HNP is forwarded locally, without traversing the
   bidirectional tunnel with the LMA.  Since HNP is used to identify
   candidate traffic for local forwarding, the protocol allows the
   flexibility of choosing a subset of the traffic for local forwarding,
   while the rest of the traffic is allowed to traverse bidirectional
   tunneling.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL", in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   The document uses the terminology specified in [pmipv6] and in
   [rfc3775].  In addition, this document defines the following:

      Local Forwarding: Data forwarding my a MAG without using the
      bidirectional tunnel with the LMA.

Internet-Draft              Local Forwarding                   July 2008



      Local Forwarding Request (LFRQ): A message sent by the LMA
      requesting a MAG to establish local forwarding for a pair of
      Mobile Nodes.

      Local Forwarding Reply (LFRP): A reply from the MAG to the LMA
      containing the resolution of LFRQ message.



3.  Protocol

   The protocol specified here assumes that both the LMA and the MAG
   have established bindings for the communicating Mobile Nodes using
   the PBU and PBA messages specified in [pmipv6].  Subsequently, a
   trigger at the LMA identifies a flow between two mobile nodes
   attached to the same MAG.  The exact flow identification mechanism is
   not specified in this document, and is left open for implementations
   and specific deployments.  An example trigger could be that an
   application-layer signaling entity (such as a SIP Proxy) notifies the
   LMA of a VoIP flow end-points, and the latter determines that the two
   end-points are attached to the same MAG.  Such a trigger mechanism
   offers local forwarding at the granularity of an individual
   application session, providing flexibility in usage.  This and other
   possible examples serve to illustrate the trigger mechanism for
   initiating local forwarding.

   As a response to the trigger, the LMA constructs a Local Forwarding
   Request (LFRQ) message assuming the local policy is so configured.
   This Mobility Header message contains the MN-Identifier and the Home
   Network Prefix (as Mobility Header options) for each of the Mobile
   Nodes involved.  The LMA sends the LFRQ message to the MAG supporting
   the two MNs.

   The MAG verifies that the two MNs are indeed attached to itself.  It
   then creates Local Forwarding Entries for each direction of the
   communication between the two MNs.  The exact form of the forwarding
   entries is implementation (and system) dependent; however, they
   should contain the HNP corresponding to the destination IP address
   and a next-hop identifier (such as the layer 2 address of the next-
   hop which is known to ensure forwarding of packets to the
   destination).  These LFEs MUST override the BUL entries for the
   specific HNPs identified in the LFRQ message.  Hence all traffic
   matching the HNPs is forwarded locally.

   The local forwarding is not permanent.  For instance, the LMA may
   send a LFRQ message with a request to cancel an existing local
   forwarding service.  Such a message may be generated as a result of

   termination of a VoIP session.  The local forwarding also has a
   default lifetime, upon the expiry of which, the forwarding reverts to
   bidirectional tunneling.  When local forwarding service ceases, the
   corresponding LFE entries MUST be removed.

   The MAG provides a resolution of the LFRQ processing in the Local
   Forwarding Reply (LFRP) message.  This Mobility Header message
   includes the MN-IDentifier and the HNP for each of the communicating
   MNs as well as an appropriate Status code disposing the outcome of
   LFRQ processing.  Status code 0 indicates local forwarding is offered
   by the MAG.  Any other value for Status code indicates the reason for
   not offering the local forwarding service.  When Status code is 0,
   the LMA adds an 'F' flag to the BCE corresponding to the HNPs to
   record that local forwarding is in progress.

   The MAG may refresh the lifetime of an existing local forwarding
   service.  For this, it sends an unsolicited LFRP (U-LFRP) message
   that contains the new lifetime value.  The MAG MUST wait for the
   following LFRQ message from the LMA before it can conclude that the
   refresh request is granted.


4.  Extending to Inter-MAG Local Forwarding

   The LMA may choose to support local forwarding to mobile nodes
   attached to two different MAGs within a single PMIPv6 domain.  As
   earlier, the LMA initiates LFRQ as response to some trigger
   mechanism.  In this case, however, it sends two separate LFRQ
   messages to the two MAGs.  In addition to the MN-ID and the HNP
   options, each LFRQ message contains the IP Address of the counterpart
   MAG.  When the MAG IP Address option is present, each MAG MUST create
   a local forwarding entry such that the packets for the MN attached to
   the remote MAG are sent over a tunnel associated with that remote
   MAG.  The tunnel between the MAGs is assumed to be established by
   means outside the scope of this document.

   As before, each MAG responds to the LFRQ with an LFRP message.
   Barring the wrror cases, all subsequent packets are routed between
   the MAGs locally, without traversing the LMA.

   The protocol does not require any synchronization between the MAGs
   before local forwarding begins.  Each MAG begins its local forwarding
   independent of the other.

      local forwarding is supported.  The MN-ID and HNP options are the
      same as in [pmipv6].



6.  Security Considerations

   The protocol specified in this document uses the same security
   association between the LMA and the MAG to protect the LFRQ and LFRP
   messages.  No new security risks are identified.  Support for
   integrity protection using IPsec is required, but support for
   confidentiality is not necessary.


7.  IANA Considerations

   The Local Forwarding Request, described in Section 5.1 and the Local
   Forwarding Reply, described in Section 5.2 require a single Mobility
   Header Type from the registry at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/mobility-parameters:
