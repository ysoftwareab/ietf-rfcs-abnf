1.  Introduction

   As Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) based Route Origin
   Validation (ROV) becomes deployed in the Internet, the quality of the
   routing control plane, and hence timely and accurate delivery of
   packets in the data plane, depend more and more on prompt and
   accurate propagation of the RPKI data from the originating
   Certification Authorities (CAs), to Relying Parties (RPs), to
   External Border Gateway Protocol (eBGP) speaking routers.

   Origination Validation based on stale ROAs allows accidental mis-
   origination.  While delayed ROA propagation to ROV in routers can
   cause loss of good traffic.  Though it may not be reasonable today,
   services such as DDoS cleaners would prefer that ROA publication had
   almost immediate effect on routing.

   This draft is an exploration of, and recommendations for, timing of
   Resource Public Key Infrastructure publication, propagation, and use
   in relying party caches and routers.

   There are the questions of how frequently a CA publishes, how often
   an RP pulls, and how often routers pull from their RP(s).  Overall,
   the router(s) SHOULD react within an hour of to ROA publication.

   For CAs publishing, a few seconds to a minute seems easily achieved
   with reasonable software.  See Section 4.

   Relying Party validating caches periodically retrieve data from CA
   publication points..  RPs using rcynic to poll publication points
   every ten minutes would be a burden today, given the load it will put
   on publication services, and one notorious repository which is
   against specification.  But RPs using RRDP impose no such load.  So
   as the infrastructure moves from rcynic to RRDP, fetching every ten
   minutes would be reasonable.  For rcynic, an hour would be the
   longest acceptable window.  See Section 5.

   For the BGP speaking router(s) pulling from the RP(s), five minutes
   to an hour is a wide window.  But, the RPKI-Rtr protocol does have
   the Serial Notify PDU, the equivalent of DNS Notify, where the cache
   tells the router that it has new data.  See Section 6.

   We discuss each of these in detail below.

2.  Related Work

   It is assumed that the reader understands BGP, [RFC4271], the RPKI
   [RFC6480], RPKI Manifests [RFC6486], Route Origin Authorizations
   (ROAs), [RFC6482], the RPKI Repository Delta Protocol (RRDP)
   [RFC8182], The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) to Router
   Protocol [I-D.ietf-sidrops-8210bis], RPKI-based Prefix Validation,
   [RFC6811], and Origin Validation Clarifications, [RFC8481].

3.  Deployment Structure

   Deployment of the RPKI to reach routers has a three-level structure
   as follows:

   Cerification Authorities:  The authoritative data of the RPKI are
      published in a distributed set of servers, Certification
      Authorities, at the IANA, RIRs, NIRs, and ISPs (see [RFC6481]).

   Relying Parties:  Relying Parties are a local set of one or more
      collected and verified caches of RPKI data.  A Relying Party,
      e.g., router or other client, MUST have a trust relationship with,
      and a trusted transport channel to, any RP(s) it uses.

      Note that RPs can pull from other RPs, thereby creating a somewhat
      complex topology.

   Routers:  A router fetches data from a local cache using the RPKI to
      Router Protocol described in [I-D.ietf-sidrops-8210bis].  It is
      said to be a client of the cache.  There are mechanisms for the

      router to assure itself of the authenticity of the cache and to
      authenticate itself to the cache.

4.  Certification Authority Publishing

   A principal constraint on publication timing is ensuring the CRL and
   Manifest ([RFC6486]) are atomically correct with respect to the other
   repository data.  With rcynic, the directory must be atomically
   correct before it becomes current.  RRDP ([RFC8182]) is similar, the
   directory must be atomically correct before it is published.

5.  Replying Party Fetching

   rcynic puts a load on RPKI publication point servers.  Therefore
   relying party caches have been discouraged from fetching more
   frequently than on the order of an hour.  Times as long as a day were
   even suggested.  With RRDP ([RFC8182]), these constraints are no
   longer relevant.

   A number of timers are embedded in the X.509 RPKI data which should
   also be considered.  E.g., CRL publication commitments, expiration of
   EE certificates pointing to Manifests and the Manifests themselves.
   Some CA operators commonly indicate new CRL information should be
   available in the next 24 hours.  These 24-hour sliding timers,
   combined with fetching RPKI data once a day, cause needless
   brittleness in the face of transient network issues between the CA
   and RP.

6.  Router Updating

   The rate of change of ROA data can be estimated to remain small,
   maybe on the order of a few ROAs a minute, but with bursts.
   Therefore, the routers may update from the (presumed local) relying
   party cache(s) quite frequently.  Note that
   [I-D.ietf-sidrops-8210bis] recommends a polling interval of one hour.
   This conservative timing is because caches can send a Serial Notify
   PDU to tell routers when there are new data to be fetched.

   A router SHOULD respond with a Serial Query when it receives a Serial
   Notify from a cache.  If a router can not respond to a Serial Notify,
   then it MUST send a periodic Serial Query no less frequently than
   once an hour.

7.  Alternative Technologies

   Should the supply chain include components or technologies other than
   those in IETF documents, the end effect SHOULD be the same; the
   router(s) SHOULD react to invalid AS origins within the same overall

   time constraint, an hour at most from ROA creation at the CA
   publication point to effect in the router.

8.  Security Considerations

   Route Origin Validation is not a security protocol.  It is intended
   to catch operational errors, and is easily gamed and attacked.

9.  IANA Considerations

   None
