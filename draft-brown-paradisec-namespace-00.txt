Abstract

This document describes a Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace for the 
identification of resources in the Pacific And Regional Archive for 
Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures (PARADISEC) archive. This 
namespace will provide persistent means of accessing the archives 
contents allowing for reliable citation.

1. Introduction and Community Considerations

PARADISEC is a partnership between four major Australian universities 
which exists to ensure the long term survival of languages and 
cultures that may have otherwise been forgotten by history. With an 
increasingly large amount of research papers being produced citing 
information within the PARADISEC archive it is important that they 
have an identifier scheme which encourages the persistence of these 
citations and therefore the communities ongoing ability to access them.

The PARADISEC URN namespace is intended as a means of providing online 
resource access to linguists, students and other interested individuals 
in a persistent manner. 

2. Specification Template

Namespace ID:

"paradisec" requested.

Registration Information:

registration version: 1
registration date: 2005-05-01

Declared registrant of the namespace:

Luke Brown
ANU Supercomputing Facility
Building 56, Australian National University
ACTON, ACT, Australia, 0200
Email: lpb900@anusf.anu.edu.au

Declaration of syntactic structure:

The Pacific And Regional Archive for Digital Sources in Endangered 
Cultures (PARADISEC) Namespace Specific String (NSS) conforms to the 
URN Syntax specification [1] and takes the form:

URN:PARADISEC:<Collection>:<Item>:<File>

The PARADISEC NSS adheres to the following ABNF [3] definition:

NSS = Collection / Item / File 

Collection = DIGIT / ALPHA / reserved

Item = DIGIT / ALPHA / reserved

File = DIGIT / ALPHA / reserved

reserved = "/" / "." / "-" / ":"


Relevant ancillary documentation:

Further information on the PARADISEC project can be located at 
http://www.paradisec.org.au/

Identifier uniqueness considerations:

The PARADISEC curators assign unique identifiers to all resources 
which are added to the archive.

Identifier persistence considerations:

PARADISEC identifiers are never reassigned and location independent 
to facilitate persistence.

Process of identifier assignment:

Identifiers are assigned by PARADISEC curators upon submission of 
materials into the PARADISEC archive by linguists.

Process for identifier resolution:

Resolution of PARADISEC URNs will be achieved through an extension 
of the DDDS [2] approach. This extension allows for per-resource 
resolution of URNs using the DNS.

Rules for Lexical Equivalence:

PARADISEC URNs are not case sensitive.

Conformance with URN Syntax:

The PARADISEC syntax extends the invalid character set in [1] 
further prohibiting use of the following: "!", "@", "#", "$", 
"%", "^", "&", "*", "(", ")", "+", "=", "[", "]", "{", "}", 
"|", "\", ";", "'", """, "<", ">", "_" and "?"

Validation mechanism:

None specified outside of the data ingestion procedure.

Scope:

Global.

3. Security Considerations

No new security considerations are presented.

4. IANA Considerations

This document includes a URN Namespace registration request 
to be entered into the IANA registry for URN NIDs.
