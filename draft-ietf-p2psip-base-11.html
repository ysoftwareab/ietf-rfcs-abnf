<h1><br />REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD) Base
    Protocol<br />draft-ietf-p2psip-base-11</h1>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>In this document the term BCP 78 and BCP 79 refer to RFC 3978 and RFC
      3979 respectively. They refer only to those RFCs and not to any
      documents that update or supersede them.
</p>
<p>This specification defines REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD),
      a peer-to-peer (P2P) signaling protocol for use on the Internet. A P2P
      signaling protocol provides its clients with an abstract storage and
      messaging service between a set of cooperating peers that form the
      overlay network. RELOAD is designed to support a P2P Session Initiation
      Protocol (P2PSIP) network, but can be utilized by other applications
      with similar requirements by defining new usages that specify the kinds
      of data that must be stored for a particular application. RELOAD defines
      a security model based on a certificate enrollment service that provides
      unique identities. NAT traversal is a fundamental service of the
      protocol. RELOAD also allows access from "client" nodes that do not need
      to route traffic or store data for others.

Introduction</h3>

<p>This document defines REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD), a
      peer-to-peer (P2P) signaling protocol for use on the Internet. It
      provides a generic, self-organizing overlay network service, allowing
      nodes to efficiently route messages to other nodes and to efficiently
      store and retrieve data in the overlay. RELOAD provides several features
      that are critical for a successful P2P protocol for the Internet:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt>Security Framework:</dt>
<dd>A P2P network will often be
          established among a set of peers that do not trust each other.
          RELOAD leverages a central enrollment server to provide credentials
          for each peer which can then be used to authenticate each operation.
          This greatly reduces the possible attack surface.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt>Usage Model:</dt>
<dd>RELOAD is designed to support a variety
          of applications, including P2P multimedia communications with the
          Session Initiation Protocol <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-p2psip-sip'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;p2psip&#8209;sip]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Jennings, C., Lowekamp, B., Rescorla, E., Baset, S., and H. Schulzrinne, &ldquo;A SIP Usage for RELOAD,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>. RELOAD allows the definition
          of new application usages, each of which can define its own data
          types, along with the rules for their use. This allows RELOAD to be
          used with new applications through a simple documentation process
          that supplies the details for each application.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt>NAT Traversal:</dt>
<dd>RELOAD is designed to function in
          environments where many if not most of the nodes are behind NATs or
          firewalls. Operations for NAT traversal are part of the base design,
          including using ICE to establish new RELOAD or application protocol
          connections.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt>High Performance Routing:</dt>
<dd>The very nature of overlay
          algorithms introduces a requirement that peers participating in the
          P2P network route requests on behalf of other peers in the network.
          This introduces a load on those other peers, in the form of
          bandwidth and processing power. RELOAD has been defined with a
          simple, lightweight forwarding header, thus minimizing the amount of
          effort required by intermediate peers.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt>Pluggable Overlay Algorithms:</dt>
<dd>RELOAD has been designed
          with an abstract interface to the overlay layer to simplify
          implementing a variety of structured (e.g., distributed hash tables)
          and unstructured overlay algorithms. This specification also defines
          how RELOAD is used with the Chord DHT algorithm, which is mandatory
          to implement. Specifying a default "must implement" overlay
          algorithm promotes interoperability, while extensibility allows
          selection of overlay algorithms optimized for a particular
          application.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>These properties were designed specifically to meet the requirements
      for a P2P protocol to support SIP. This document defines the base
      protocol for the distributed storage and location service, as well as
      critical usages for NAT traversal and security. The SIP Usage itself is
      described separately in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-p2psip-sip'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;p2psip&#8209;sip]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Jennings, C., Lowekamp, B., Rescorla, E., Baset, S., and H. Schulzrinne, &ldquo;A SIP Usage for RELOAD,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>.
      RELOAD is not limited to usage by SIP and could serve as a tool for
      supporting other P2P applications with similar needs. RELOAD is also
      based on the concepts introduced in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-p2psip-concepts'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;p2psip&#8209;concepts]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bryan, D., Matthews, P., Shim, E., Willis, D., and S.

<a name="rfc.section.1.1"></a><h3>1.1.&nbsp;
Basic Setting</h3>

<p>In this section, we provide a brief overview of the operational
        setting for RELOAD. See the concepts document<a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-p2psip-concepts'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;p2psip&#8209;concepts]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bryan, D., Matthews, P., Shim, E., Willis, D., and S. Dawkins, &ldquo;Concepts and Terminology for Peer to Peer SIP,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> for more details. A RELOAD
        Overlay Instance consists of a set of nodes arranged in a connected
        graph. Each node in the overlay is assigned a numeric Node-ID which,
        together with the specific overlay algorithm in use, determines its
        position in the graph and the set of nodes it connects to. The figure
        below shows a trivial example which isn't drawn from any particular
        overlay algorithm, but was chosen for convenience of
        representation.

<p>Because the graph is not fully connected, when a node wants to send
        a message to another node, it may need to route it through the
        network. For instance, Node 10 can talk directly to nodes 20 and 40,
        but not to Node 70. In order to send a message to Node 70, it would
        first send it to Node 40 with instructions to pass it along to Node
        70. Different overlay algorithms will have different connectivity
        graphs, but the general idea behind all of them is to allow any node
        in the graph to efficiently reach every other node within a small
        number of hops.
</p>
<p>The RELOAD network is not only a messaging network. It is also a
        storage network. Records are stored under numeric addresses which
        occupy the same space as node identifiers. Peers are responsible for
        storing the data associated with some set of addresses as determined
        by their Node-ID. For instance, we might say that every peer is
        responsible for storing any data value which has an address less than
        or equal to its own Node-ID, but greater than the next lowest Node-ID.
        Thus, Node-20 would be responsible for storing values 11-20.
</p>
<p>RELOAD also supports clients. These are nodes which have Node-IDs
        but do not participate in routing or storage. For instance, in the
        figure above Node 85 is a client. It can route to the rest of the
        RELOAD network via Node 80, but no other node will route through it
        and Node 90 is still responsible for all addresses between 81-90. We
        refer to non-client nodes as peers.
</p>
<p>Other applications (for instance, SIP) can be defined on top of
        RELOAD and use these two basic RELOAD services to provide their own
        services.

<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt>Usage Layer:</dt>
<dd>Each application defines a RELOAD

<dt>Topology Plugin:</dt>
<dd>The Topology Plugin is responsible

            replication, and directly to the Forwarding Layer to control
            hop-by-hop message forwarding. This component closely parallels
            conventional routing algorithms, but is more tightly coupled to
            the Forwarding Layer because there is no single "routing table"
            equivalent used by all overlay algorithms.

<dt>Forwarding and Link Management Layer:</dt>
<dd>Stores and

<a name="rfc.section.1.2.1"></a><h3>1.2.1.&nbsp;
Usage Layer</h3>

<p>The top layer, called the Usage Layer, has application usages,
          such as the SIP Location Usage <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-p2psip-sip'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;p2psip&#8209;sip]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Jennings, C., Lowekamp, B., Rescorla, E., Baset, S., and H. Schulzrinne, &ldquo;A SIP Usage for RELOAD,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>, that use the abstract Message
          Transport Service provided by RELOAD. The goal of this layer is to
          implement application-specific usages of the generic overlay
          services provided by RELOAD. The usage defines how a specific
          application maps its data into something that can be stored in the
          overlay, where to store the data, how to secure the data, and
          finally how applications can retrieve and use the data.
</p>
<p>The architecture diagram shows both a SIP usage and an XMPP
          usage. A single application may require multiple usages; for example
          a softphone application may also require a voicemail usage. A usage
          may define multiple kinds of data that are stored in the overlay and
          may also rely on kinds originally defined by other usages.
</p>
<p>Because the security and storage policies for each kind are
          dictated by the usage defining the kind, the usages may be coupled
          with the Storage component to provide security policy enforcement
          and to implement appropriate storage strategies according to the
          needs of the usage. The exact implementation of such an interface is
          outside the scope of this specification.

<a name="rfc.section.1.2.2"></a><h3>1.2.2.&nbsp;
Message Transport</h3>

<p>The Message Transport component provides a generic message
          routing service for the overlay. The Message Transport layer is
          responsible for end-to-end message transactions, including
          retransmissions. Each peer is identified by its location in the
          overlay as determined by its Node-ID. A component that is a client
          of the Message Transport can perform two basic functions:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Send a message to a given peer specified by Node-ID or to the
              peer responsible for a particular Resource-ID.
</li>
<li>Receive messages that other peers sent to a Node-ID or
              Resource-ID for which the receiving peer is responsible.
</li>
</ul>

<p>All usages rely on the Message Transport component to send and
          receive messages from peers. For instance, when a usage wants to
          store data, it does so by sending Store requests. Note that the
          Storage component and the Topology Plugin are themselves clients of
          the Message Transport, because they need to send and receive
          messages from other peers.
</p>
<p>The Message Transport Service is similar to those described as
          providing "Key based routing" (KBR), although as RELOAD supports
          different overlay algorithms (including non-DHT overlay algorithms)
          that calculate keys in different ways, the actual interface must
          accept Resource Names rather than actual keys.
</p>

<a name="rfc.section.1.2.3"></a><h3>1.2.3.&nbsp;
Storage</h3>

<p>One of the major functions of RELOAD is to allow nodes to store
          data in the overlay and to retrieve data stored by other nodes or by
          themselves. The Storage component is responsible for processing data
          storage and retrieval messages. For instance, the Storage component
          might receive a Store request for a given resource from the Message
          Transport. It would then query the appropriate usage before storing
          the data value(s) in its local data store and sending a response to
          the Message Transport for delivery to the requesting node.
          Typically, these messages will come from other nodes, but depending
          on the overlay topology, a node might be responsible for storing
          data for itself as well, especially if the overlay is small.
</p>
<p>A peer's Node-ID determines the set of resources that it will be
          responsible for storing. However, the exact mapping between these is
          determined by the overlay algorithm in use. The Storage component
          will only receive a Store request from the Message Transport if this
          peer is responsible for that Resource-ID. The Storage component is
          notified by the Topology Plugin when the Resource-IDs for which it
          is responsible change, and the Storage component is then responsible
          for migrating resources to other peers, as required.

<a name="rfc.section.1.2.4"></a><h3>1.2.4.&nbsp;
Topology Plugin</h3>

<p>RELOAD is explicitly designed to work with a variety of overlay
          algorithms. In order to facilitate this, the overlay algorithm
          implementation is provided by a Topology Plugin so that each overlay
          can select an appropriate overlay algorithm that relies on the
          common RELOAD core protocols and code.
</p>
<p>The Topology Plugin is responsible for maintaining the overlay
          algorithm Routing Table, which is consulted by the Forwarding and
          Link Management Layer before routing a message. When connections are
          made or broken, the Forwarding and Link Management Layer notifies
          the Topology Plugin, which adjusts the routing table as appropriate.
          The Topology Plugin will also instruct the Forwarding and Link
          Management Layer to form new connections as dictated by the
          requirements of the overlay algorithm Topology. The Topology Plugin
          issues periodic update requests through Message Transport to
          maintain and update its Routing Table.
</p>
<p>As peers enter and leave, resources may be stored on different
          peers, so the Topology Plugin also keeps track of which peers are
          responsible for which resources. As peers join and leave, the
          Topology Plugin instructs the Storage component to issue resource
          migration requests as appropriate, in order to ensure that other
          peers have whatever resources they are now responsible for. The
          Topology Plugin is also responsible for providing for redundant data
          storage to protect against loss of information in the event of a
          peer failure and to protect against compromised or subversive
          peers.

Forwarding and Link Management Layer</h3>

<p>The Forwarding and Link Management Layer is responsible for
          getting a message to the next peer, as determined by the Topology
          Plugin. This Layer establishes and maintains the network connections
          as required by the Topology Plugin. This layer is also responsible
          for setting up connections to other peers through NATs and firewalls
          using ICE, and it can elect to forward traffic using relays for NAT
          and firewall traversal.
</p>
<p>This layer provides a generic interface that allows the topology
          plugin to control the overlay and resource operations and messages.
          Since each overlay algorithm is defined and functions differently,
          we generically refer to the table of other peers that the overlay
          algorithm maintains and uses to route requests (neighbors) as a
          Routing Table. The Topology Plugin actually owns the Routing Table,
          and forwarding decisions are made by querying the Topology Plugin
          for the next hop for a particular Node-ID or Resource-ID. If this
          node is the destination of the message, the message is delivered to
          the Message Transport.
</p>
<p>This layer also utilizes a framing header to encapsulate messages
          as they are forwarding along each hop. This header aids reliability
          congestion control, flow control, etc. It has meaning only in the
          context of that individual link.
</p>
<p>The Forwarding and Link Management Layer sits on top of the
          Overlay Link Layer protocols that carry the actual traffic. This
          specification defines how to use DTLS and TLS protocols to carry
          RELOAD messages.

<a name="rfc.section.1.3"></a><h3>1.3.&nbsp;
Security</h3>

<p>RELOAD's security model is based on each node having one or more
        public key certificates. In general, these certificates will be
        assigned by a central server which also assigns Node-IDs, although
        self-signed certificates can be used in closed networks. These
        credentials can be leveraged to provide communications security for
        RELOAD messages. RELOAD provides communications security at three
        levels:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Connection Level: </dt>
<dd>Connections between peers are
            secured with TLS, DTLS, or potentially some to be defined future
            protocol.
</dd>
<dt>Message Level: </dt>
<dd>Each RELOAD message must be
            signed.
</dd>
<dt>Object Level: </dt>
<dd>Stored objects must be signed by the
            storing peer.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>These three levels of security work together to allow peers to
        verify the origin and correctness of data they receive from other
        peers, even in the face of malicious activity by other peers in the
        overlay. RELOAD also provides access control built on top of these
        communications security features. Because the peer responsible for
        storing a piece of data can validate the signature on the data being
        stored, the responsible peer can determine whether a given operation
        is permitted or not.
</p>
<p>RELOAD also provides an optional shared secret based admission
        control feature using shared secrets and TLS-PSK. In order to form a
        TLS connection to any node in the overlay, a new node needs to know
        the shared overlay key, thus restricting access to authorized users
        only. This feature is used together with certificate-based access
        control, not as a replacement for it. It is typically used when
        self-signed certificates are being used but would generally not be
        used when the certificates were all signed by an enrollment
        server.

<dt>Node:</dt>
<dd>We use the term "Node" to refer to a host that
          may be either a Peer or a Client. Because RELOAD uses the same
          protocol for both clients and peers, much of the text applies
          equally to both. Therefore we use "Node" when the text applies to

          structured P2P networks the resource name is typically mapped into a
          Resource-ID by using the string as the input to hash function. A SIP

          example of a Resource Name.

<dt>Resource-ID:</dt>
<dd>A value that identifies some resources
          and which is used as a key for storing and retrieving the resource.
          Often this is not human friendly/readable. One way to generate a
          Resource-ID is by applying a mapping function to some other unique
          name (e.g., user name or service name) for the resource. The
          Resource-ID is used by the distributed database algorithm to
          determine the peer or peers that are responsible for storing the
          data for the overlay. In structured P2P networks, Resource-IDs are
          generally fixed length and are formed by hashing the resource name.

Overlay Management Overview</h3>

<p>The most basic function of RELOAD is as a generic overlay network.
      Nodes need to be able to join the overlay, form connections to other
      nodes, and route messages through the overlay to nodes to which they are
      not directly connected. This section provides an overview of the
      mechanisms that perform these functions.

<a name="rfc.section.3.1"></a><h3>3.1.&nbsp;
Security and Identification</h3>

<p>Every node in the RELOAD overlay is identified by a Node-ID. The
        Node-ID is used for three major purposes:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>To address the node itself.
</li>
<li>To determine its position in the overlay topology when the
            overlay is structured.
</li>
<li>To determine the set of resources for which the node is
            responsible.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Each node has a certificate <a class='info' href='#RFC5280'>[RFC5280]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Cooper, D., Santesson, S., Farrell, S., Boeyen, S., Housley, R., and W. Polk, &ldquo;Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>
        containing a Node-ID, which is unique within an overlay instance.
</p>
<p>The certificate serves multiple purposes:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>It entitles the user to store data at specific locations in the
            Overlay Instance. Each data kind defines the specific rules for
            determining which certificates can access each Resource-ID/Kind-ID
            pair. For instance, some kinds might allow anyone to write at a
            given location, whereas others might restrict writes to the owner
            of a single certificate.
</li>
<li>It entitles the user to operate a node that has a Node-ID found
            in the certificate. When the node forms a connection to another
            peer, it uses this certificate so that a node connecting to it
            knows it is connected to the correct node (technically: a (D)TLS
            association with client authentication is formed.) In addition,
            the node can sign messages, thus providing integrity and
            authentication for messages which are sent from the node.
</li>
<li>It entitles the user to use the user name found in the
            certificate.
</li>
</ul>

<p>If a user has more than one device, typically they would get one
        certificate for each device. This allows each device to act as a
        separate peer.
</p>
<p>RELOAD supports multiple certificate issuance models. The first is
        based on a central enrollment process which allocates a unique name
        and Node-ID and puts them in a certificate for the user. All peers in
        a particular Overlay Instance have the enrollment server as a trust
        anchor and so can verify any other peer's certificate.
</p>
<p>In some settings, a group of users want to set up an overlay
        network but are not concerned about attack by other users in the
        network. For instance, users on a LAN might want to set up a short
        term ad hoc network without going to the trouble of setting up an
        enrollment server. RELOAD supports the use of self-generated,
        self-signed certificates. When self-signed certificates are used, the
        node also generates its own Node-ID and username. The Node-ID is
        computed as a digest of the public key, to prevent Node-ID theft;
        however this model is still subject to a number of known attacks (most
        notably Sybil attacks <a class='info' href='#Sybil'>[Sybil]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Douceur, J., &ldquo;The Sybil Attack,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>) and can only be
        safely used in closed networks where users are mutually trusting.
</p>
<p>The general principle here is that the security mechanisms (TLS and
        message signatures) are always used, even if the certificates are
        self-signed. This allows for a single set of code paths in the systems
        with the only difference being whether certificate verification is
        required to chain to a single root of trust.

Shared-Key Security</h3>

<p>RELOAD also provides an admission control system based on shared
          keys. In this model, the peers all share a single key which is used
          to authenticate the peer-to-peer connections via
          TLS-PSK/TLS-SRP.

<a name="rfc.section.3.2"></a><h3>3.2.&nbsp;
Clients</h3>

<p>RELOAD defines a single protocol that is used both as the peer
        protocol and as the client protocol for the overlay. This simplifies
        implementation, particularly for devices that may act in either role,
        and allows clients to inject messages directly into the overlay.
</p>
<p>We use the term "peer" to identify a node in the overlay that
        routes messages for nodes other than those to which it is directly
        connected. Peers typically also have storage responsibilities. We use
        the term "client" to refer to nodes that do not have routing or
        storage responsibilities. When text applies to both peers and clients,
        we will simply refer such devices as "nodes."
</p>
<p>RELOAD's client support allows nodes that are not participating in
        the overlay as peers to utilize the same implementation and to benefit
        from the same security mechanisms as the peers. Clients possess and
        use certificates that authorize the user to store data at certain
        locations in the overlay. The Node-ID in the certificate is used to
        identify the particular client as a member of the overlay and to
        authenticate its messages.
</p>
<p>In RELOAD, unlike some other designs, clients are not a first-class
        concept. From the perspective of a peer, a client is simply a node
        which has not yet sent any Updates or Joins. It might never do so (if
        it's a client) or it might eventually do so (if it's just a node
        that's taking a long time to join). The routing and storage rules for
        RELOAD provide for correct behavior by peers regardless of whether
        other nodes attached to them are clients or peers. Of course, a client
        implementation must know that it intends to be a client, but this
        localizes complexity only to that node.
</p>

<a name="rfc.section.3.2.1"></a><h3>3.2.1.&nbsp;
Client Routing</h3>

<p>Clients may insert themselves in the overlay in two ways:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Establish a connection to the peer responsible for the
              client's Node-ID in the overlay. Then requests may be sent
              from/to the client using its Node-ID in the same manner as if it
              were a peer, because the responsible peer in the overlay will
              handle the final step of routing to the client. This may require
              a TURN relay in cases where NATs or firewalls prevent a client
              from forming a direct connections with its responsible peer.
              Note that clients that choose this option MUST process Update
              messages from the peer. Those updates can indicate that the peer
              no longer is responsible for the Client's Node-ID. The client
              then MUST form a connection to the appropriate peer. Failure to
              do so will result in the client no longer receiving
              messages.
</li>
<li>Establish a connection with an arbitrary peer in the overlay
              (perhaps based on network proximity or an inability to establish
              a direct connection with the responsible peer). In this case,
              the client will rely on RELOAD's Destination List feature to
              ensure reachability. The client can initiate requests, and any
              node in the overlay that knows the Destination List to its
              current location can reach it, but the client is not directly
              reachable using only its Node-ID. If the client is to receive
              incoming requests from other members of the overlay, the
              Destination List required to reach it must be learnable via
              other mechanisms, such as being stored in the overlay by a
              usage.
</li>
</ul>

<a name="rfc.section.3.2.2"></a><h3>3.2.2.&nbsp;
Minimum Functionality Requirements for Clients</h3>

<p>A node may act as a client simply because it does not have the
          resources or even an implementation of the topology plugin required
          to act as a peer in the overlay. In order to exchange RELOAD
          messages with a peer, a client must meet a minimum level of
          functionality. Such a client must:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Implement RELOAD's connection-management operations that are
              used to establish the connection with the peer.
</li>
<li>Implement RELOAD's data retrieval methods (with client
              functionality).
</li>
<li>Be able to calculate Resource-IDs used by the overlay.
</li>
<li>Possess security credentials required by the overlay it is
              implementing.
</li>
</ul>

<p>A client speaks the same protocol as the peers, knows how to
          calculate Resource-IDs, and signs its requests in the same manner as
          peers. While a client does not necessarily require a full
          implementation of the overlay algorithm, calculating the Resource-ID
          requires an implementation of the appropriate algorithm for the
          overlay.

</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>

            using connections between nodes separated by one or more NATs,

            allowing/requiring it.

            request and not to some other node.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>RELOAD's routing provides three mechanisms designed to assist in
        meeting these needs:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Destination Lists: </dt>
<dd>While in principle it is
            possible to just inject a message into the overlay with a bare
            NodeID as the destination, RELOAD provides a source routing
            capability in the form of "Destination Lists". A "Destination List
            provides a list of the nodes through which a message must
            flow.
</dd>
<dt>Via Lists: </dt>
<dd>In order to allow responses to follow
            the same path as requests, each message also contains a "Via
            List", which is added to by each node a message traverses. This
            via list can then be inverted and used as a destination list for
            the response.
</dd>
<dt>RouteQuery: </dt>
<dd>The RouteQuery method allows a node to
            query a peer for the next hop it will use to route a message. This
            method is useful for diagnostics and for iterative routing.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>The basic routing mechanism used by RELOAD is Symmetric Recursive.
        We will first describe symmetric recursive routing and then discuss
        its advantages in terms of the requirements discussed above.
</p>
<p>Symmetric recursive routing requires that a message follow a path
        through the overlay to the destination without returning to the
        originating node: each peer forwards the message closer to its
        destination. The return path of the response is then the same path
        followed in reverse. For example, a message following a route from A
        to Z through B and X:
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
A         B         X         Z
-------------------------------

----------&gt;
Dest=Z
         ----------&gt;
         Via=A
         Dest=Z
                   ----------&gt;
                   Via=A, B
                   Dest=Z


                   &lt;----------
                  Dest=X, B, A
         &lt;----------
           Dest=B, A
&lt;----------
    Dest=A
</pre></div>
<p>Note that the preceding Figure does not indicate whether A is a
        client or peer: A forwards its request to B and the response is
        returned to A in the same manner regardless of A's role in the
        overlay.
</p>
<p>This figure shows use of full via-lists by intermediate peers B and
        X. However, if B and/or X are willing to store state, then they may
        elect to truncate the lists, save that information internally (keyed
        by the transaction id), and return the response message along the path
        from which it was received when the response is received. This option
        requires greater state to be stored on intermediate peers but saves a
        small amount of bandwidth and reduces the need for modifying the
        message en route. Selection of this mode of operation is a choice for
        the individual peer; the techniques are interoperable even on a single
        message. The figure below shows B using full via lists but X
        truncating them to X1 and saving the state internally.

<p>RELOAD also supports a basic Iterative routing mode (where the
        intermediate peers merely return a response indicating the next hop,
        but do not actually forward the message to that next hop themselves).
        Iterative routing is implemented using the RouteQuery method, which
        requests this behavior. Note that iterative routing is selected only
        by the initiating node.

Connectivity Management</h3>

<p>In order to provide efficient routing, a peer needs to maintain a
        set of direct connections to other peers in the Overlay Instance. Due
        to the presence of NATs, these connections often cannot be formed
        directly. Instead, we use the Attach request to establish a
        connection. Attach uses ICE <a class='info' href='#RFC5245'>[RFC5245]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., &ldquo;Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE): A Protocol for Network Address Translator (NAT) Traversal for Offer/Answer Protocols,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a> to
        establish the connection. It is assumed that the reader is familiar
        with ICE.
</p>
<p>Say that peer A wishes to form a direct connection to peer B. It
        gathers ICE candidates and packages them up in an Attach request which
        it sends to B through usual overlay routing procedures. B does its own
        candidate gathering and sends back a response with its candidates. A
        and B then do ICE connectivity checks on the candidate pairs. The
        result is a connection between A and B. At this point, A and B can add
        each other to their routing tables and send messages directly between
        themselves without going through other overlay peers.
</p>
<p>There is one special case in which Attach cannot be used: when a
        peer is joining the overlay and is not connected to any peers. In
        order to support this case, some small number of "bootstrap nodes"
        typically need to be publicly accessible so that new peers can
        directly connect to them. <a class='info' href='#sec-enrollment'>Section&nbsp;10<span> (</span><span class='info'>Enrollment and Bootstrap</span><span>)</span></a>
        contains more detail on this.
</p>
<p>In general, a peer needs to maintain connections to all of the
        peers near it in the Overlay Instance and to enough other peers to
        have efficient routing (the details depend on the specific overlay).
        If a peer cannot form a connection to some other peer, this isn't
        necessarily a disaster; overlays can route correctly even without
        fully connected links. However, a peer should try to maintain the
        specified link set and if it detects that it has fewer direct
        connections, should form more as required. This also implies that
        peers need to periodically verify that the connected peers are still
        alive and if not try to reform the connection or form an alternate
        one.

<a name="rfc.section.3.5.2"></a><h3>3.5.2.&nbsp;
Joining, Leaving, and Maintenance Overview</h3>

<p>When a new peer wishes to join the Overlay Instance, it must have
          a Node-ID that it is allowed to use and a set of credentials which
          match that Node-ID. When an enrollment server is used that Node-ID
          will be in the certificate the node received from the enrollment
          server. The details of the joining procedure are defined by the
          overlay algorithm, but the general steps for joining an Overlay
          Instance are:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Forming connections to some other peers.
</li>
<li>Acquiring the data values this peer is responsible for
              storing.
</li>
<li>Informing the other peers which were previously responsible
              for that data that this peer has taken over responsibility.
</li>
</ul>

<p>The first thing the peer needs to do is to form a connection to
          some "bootstrap node". Because this is the first connection the peer
          makes, these nodes must have public IP addresses so that they can be
          connected to directly. Once a peer has connected to one or more
          bootstrap nodes, it can form connections in the usual way by routing
          Attach messages through the overlay to other nodes. Once a peer has
          connected to the overlay for the first time, it can cache the set of
          nodes it has connected to with public IP addresses for use as future
          bootstrap nodes.
</p>
<p>Once a peer has connected to a bootstrap node, it then needs to
          take up its appropriate place in the overlay. This requires two
          major operations:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Forming connections to other peers in the overlay to populate
              its Routing Table.
</li>
<li>Getting a copy of the data it is now responsible for storing
              and assuming responsibility for that data.
</li>
</ul>

<p>The second operation is performed by contacting the Admitting
          Peer (AP), the node which is currently responsible for that section
          of the overlay.
</p>
<p>The details of this operation depend mostly on the overlay
          algorithm involved, but a typical case would be:
</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>JP (Joining Peer) sends a Join request to AP (Admitting Peer)
              announcing its intention to join.
</li>
<li>AP sends a Join response.
</li>
<li>AP does a sequence of Stores to JP to give it the data it
              will need.
</li>
<li>AP does Updates to JP and to other peers to tell it about its
              own routing table. At this point, both JP and AP consider JP
              responsible for some section of the Overlay Instance.
</li>
<li>JP makes its own connections to the appropriate peers in the
              Overlay Instance.
</li>
</ol>

<p>After this process is completed, JP is a full member of the
          Overlay Instance and can process Store/Fetch requests.
</p>
<p>Note that the first node is a special case. When ordinary nodes
          cannot form connections to the bootstrap nodes, then they are not
          part of the overlay. However, the first node in the overlay can
          obviously not connect to other nodes. In order to support this case,
          potential first nodes (which must also serve as bootstrap nodes
          initially) must somehow be instructed (perhaps by configuration
          settings) that they are the entire overlay, rather than not part of
          it.
</p>
<p>Note that clients do not perform either of these operations.

First-Time Setup</h3>

<p>Previous sections addressed how RELOAD works once a node has
        connected. This section provides an overview of how users get
        connected to the overlay for the first time. RELOAD is designed so
        that users can start with the name of the overlay they wish to join
        and perhaps a username and password, and leverage that into having a
        working peer with minimal user intervention. This helps avoid the
        problems that have been experienced with conventional SIP clients
        where users are required to manually configure a large number of
        settings.

<a name="rfc.section.3.6.1"></a><h3>3.6.1.&nbsp;
Initial Configuration</h3>

<p>In the first phase of the process, the user starts out with the
          name of the overlay and uses this to download an initial set of
          overlay configuration parameters. The node does a DNS SRV lookup on
          the overlay name to get the address of a configuration server. It
          can then connect to this server with HTTPS to download a
          configuration document which contains the basic overlay
          configuration parameters as well as a set of bootstrap nodes which
          can be used to join the overlay.
</p>
<p>If a node already has the valid configuration document that it
          received by some out of band method, this step can be skipped.

<a name="rfc.section.3.6.2"></a><h3>3.6.2.&nbsp;
Enrollment</h3>

<p>If the overlay is using centralized enrollment, then a user needs
          to acquire a certificate before joining the overlay. The certificate
          attests both to the user's name within the overlay and to the
          Node-IDs which they are permitted to operate. In that case, the
          configuration document will contain the address of an enrollment
          server which can be used to obtain such a certificate. The
          enrollment server may (and probably will) require some sort of
          username and password before issuing the certificate. The enrollment
          server's ability to restrict attackers' access to certificates in
          the overlay is one of the cornerstones of RELOAD's security.

<p>Each kind is identified by a Kind-ID, which is a code point
        assigned by IANA. As part of the kind definition, protocol designers
        may define constraints, such as limits on size, on the values which
        may be stored. For many kinds, the set may be restricted to a single
        value; some sets may be allowed to contain multiple identical items
        while others may only have unique items. Note that a kind may be
        employed by multiple usages and new usages are encouraged to use
        previously defined kinds where possible. We define the following data
        models in this document, though other usages can define their own
        structures:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt>single value:</dt>
<dd>There can be at most one item in the
            set and any value overwrites the previous item.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt>array:</dt>
<dd>Many values can be stored and addressed by a
            numeric index.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt>dictionary:</dt>
<dd>The values stored are indexed by a key.
            Often this key is one of the values from the certificate of the
            peer sending the Store request.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>In order to protect stored data from tampering, by other nodes,
        each stored value is digitally signed by the node which created it.
        When a value is retrieved, the digital signature can be verified to
        detect tampering.

<a name="rfc.section.4.1.1"></a><h3>4.1.1.&nbsp;
Storage Permissions</h3>

<p>A major issue in peer-to-peer storage networks is minimizing the
          burden of becoming a peer, and in particular minimizing the amount
          of data which any peer is required to store for other nodes. RELOAD
          addresses this issue by only allowing any given node to store data
          at a small number of locations in the overlay, with those locations
          being determined by the node's certificate. When a peer uses a Store
          request to place data at a location authorized by its certificate,
          it signs that data with the private key that corresponds to its
          certificate. Then the peer responsible for storing the data is able
          to verify that the peer issuing the request is authorized to make
          that request. Each data kind defines the exact rules for determining
          what certificate is appropriate.
</p>
<p>The most natural rule is that a certificate authorizes a user to
          store data keyed with their user name X. This rule is used for all
          the kinds defined in this specification. Thus, only a user with a
          certificate for "alice@example.org" could write to that location in
          the overlay. However, other usages can define any rules they choose,
          including publicly writable values.
</p>
<p>The digital signature over the data serves two purposes. First,
          it allows the peer responsible for storing the data to verify that
          this Store is authorized. Second, it provides integrity for the
          data. The signature is saved along with the data value (or values)
          so that any reader can verify the integrity of the data. Of course,
          the responsible peer can "lose" the value but it cannot undetectably
          modify it.
</p>
<p>The size requirements of the data being stored in the overlay are
          variable. For instance, a SIP AOR and voicemail differ widely in the
          storage size. RELOAD leaves it to the Usage and overlay
          configuration to limit size imbalance of various kinds.

Usages</h3>

<p>By itself, the distributed storage layer just provides
          infrastructure on which applications are built. In order to do
          anything useful, a usage must be defined. Each Usage needs to
          specify several things:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Registers Kind-ID code points for any kinds that the Usage
              defines.
</li>
<li>Defines the data structure for each of the kinds.
</li>
<li>Defines access control rules for each of the kinds.
</li>
<li>Defines how the Resource Name is formed that is hashed to
              form the Resource-ID where each kind is stored.
</li>
<li>Describes how values will be merged after a network
              partition. Unless otherwise specified, the default merging rule
              is to act as if all the values that need to be merged were
              stored and as if the order they were stored in corresponds to
              the stored time values associated with (and carried in) their
              values. Because the stored time values are those associated with
              the peer which did the writing, clock skew is generally not an
              issue. If two nodes are on different partitions, write to the
              same location, and have clock skew, this can create merge
              conflicts. However because RELOAD deliberately segregates
              storage so that data from different users and peers is stored in
              different locations, and a single peer will typically only be in
              a single network partition, this case will generally not
              arise.
</li>
</ul>

<p>The kinds defined by a usage may also be applied to other usages.
          However, a need for different parameters, such as different size
          limits, would imply the need to create a new kind.

Replication</h3>

<p>Replication in P2P overlays can be used to provide:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>persistence: </dt>
<dd>if the responsible peer crashes
              and/or if the storing peer leaves the overlay

              responsible peer or routing attacks to that responsible peer
</dd>
<dt>load balancing: </dt>
<dd>to balance the load of queries
              for popular resources.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>A variety of schemes are used in P2P overlays to achieve some of
          these goals. Common techniques include replicating on neighbors of
          the responsible peer, randomly locating replicas around the overlay,
          or replicating along the path to the responsible peer.
</p>
<p>The core RELOAD specification does not specify a particular
          replication strategy. Instead, the first level of replication
          strategies are determined by the overlay algorithm, which can base
          the replication strategy on its particular topology. For example,

Service Discovery</h3>

<p>RELOAD does not currently define a generic service discovery
        algorithm as part of the base protocol, although a simplistic
        TURN-specific discovery mechanism is provided. A variety of service
        discovery algorithms can be implemented as extensions to the base
        protocol, such as the service discovery algorithm ReDIR <a class='info' href='#opendht-sigcomm05'>[opendht&#8209;sigcomm05]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rhea, S., Godfrey, B., Karp, B., Kubiatowicz, J., Ratnasamy, S., Shenker, S., Stoica, I., and H.

<a name="rfc.section.4.3"></a><h3>4.3.&nbsp;
Application Connectivity</h3>

<p>There is no requirement that a RELOAD usage must use RELOAD's
        primitives for establishing its own communication if it already
        possesses its own means of establishing connections. For example, one
        could design a RELOAD-based resource discovery protocol which used
        HTTP to retrieve the actual data.
</p>
<p>For more common situations, however, it is the overlay itself -
        rather than an external authority such as DNS - which is used to
        establish a connection. RELOAD provides connectivity to applications
        using the AppAttach method. For example, if a P2PSIP node wishes to
        establish a SIP dialog with another P2PSIP node, it will use AppAttach
        to establish a direct connection with the other node. This new
        connection is separate from the peer protocol connection. It is a
        dedicated UDP or TCP flow used only for the SIP dialog. Each usage
        specifies which types of connections can be initiated using
        AppAttach.

Overlay Management Protocol</h3>

<p>This section defines the basic protocols used to create, maintain,
      and use the RELOAD overlay network. We start by defining the basic
      concept of how message destinations are interpreted when routing
      messages. We then describe the symmetric recursive routing model, which
      is RELOAD's default routing algorithm. We then define the message
      structure and then finally define the messages used to join and maintain
      the overlay.

<a name="rfc.section.5.1"></a><h3>5.1.&nbsp;
Message Receipt and Forwarding</h3>

<p>When a peer receives a message, it first examines the overlay,
        version, and other header fields to determine whether the message is
        one it can process. If any of these are incorrect (e.g., the message
        is for an overlay in which the peer does not participate) it is an
        error. The peer SHOULD generate an appropriate error but local policy
        can override this and cause the messages to be silently dropped.
</p>
<p>Once the peer has determined that the message is correctly
        formatted, it examines the first entry on the destination list. There
        are three possible cases here:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The first entry on the destination list is an ID for which the
            peer is responsible.
</li>
<li>The first entry on the destination list is an ID for which
            another peer is responsible.
</li>
<li>The first entry on the destination list is a private ID that is
            being used for destination list compression. This is described
            later (note that private IDs can be distinguished from NodeIDs and
            Resource IDs on the wire; see <a class='info' href='#sec.dest-via-list'>Section&nbsp;5.3.2.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Destination and Via Lists</span><span>)</span></a>).
</li>
</ul>

<p>These cases are handled as discussed below.

Responsible ID</h3>

<p>If the first entry on the destination list is an ID for which the
          node is responsible, there are several sub-cases to consider.
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>
</li>
<li>If the entry is a Resource-ID, then it MUST be the only entry
              on the destination list. If there are other entries, the message
              MUST be silently dropped. Otherwise, the message is destined for
              this node and it passes it up to the upper layers.
</li>
<li>If the entry is a Node-ID which equals this node's Node-ID,
              then the message is destined for this node. If this is the only
              entry on the destination list, the message is destined for this
              node and is passed up to the upper layers. Otherwise the entry
              is removed from the destination list and the message is passed
              to the Message Transport. If the message is a response and there
              is state for the transaction ID, the state is reinserted into
              the destination list before the message is further
              processed.
</li>
<li>If the entry is a Node-ID which is not equal to this node,
              then the node MUST drop the message silently unless the Node-ID
              corresponds to a node which is directly connected to this node
              (i.e., a client). In that case, it MUST forward the message to
              the destination node as described in the next section.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that this implies that in order to address a message to "the
          peer that controls region X", a sender sends to Resource-ID X, not
          Node-ID X.
</p>

<a name="rfc.section.5.1.2"></a><h3>5.1.2.&nbsp;
Other ID</h3>

<p>If neither of the other three cases applies, then the peer MUST
          forward the message towards the first entry on the destination list.
          This means that it MUST select one of the peers to which it is
          connected and which is likely to be responsible for the first entry
          on the destination list. If the first entry on the destination list
          is in the peer's connection table, then it SHOULD forward the
          message to that peer directly. Otherwise, the peer consults the
          routing table to forward the message.
</p>
<p>Any intermediate peer which forwards a RELOAD message MUST
          arrange that if it receives a response to that message the response
          can be routed back through the set of nodes through which the
          request passed. This may be arranged in one of two ways:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The peer MAY add an entry to the via list in the forwarding
              header that will enable it to determine the correct node.
</li>
<li>The peer MAY keep per-transaction state which will allow it
              to determine the correct node.
</li>
</ul>

<p>As an example of the first strategy, if node D receives a message
          from node C with via list (A, B), then D would forward to the next
          node (E) with via list (A, B, C). Now, if E wants to respond to the
          message, it reverses the via list to produce the destination list,
          resulting in (D, C, B, A). When D forwards the response to C, the
          destination list will contain (C, B, A).
</p>
<p>As an example of the second strategy, if node D receives a
          message from node C with transaction ID X and via list (A, B), it
          could store (X, C) in its state database and forward the message
          with the via list unchanged. When D receives the response, it
          consults its state database for transaction id X, determines that
          the request came from C, and forwards the response to C.
</p>
<p>Intermediate peers which modify the via list are not required to
          simply add entries. The only requirement is that the peer be able to
          reconstruct the correct destination list on the return route. RELOAD
          provides explicit support for this functionality in the form of
          private IDs, which can replace any number of via list entries. For
          instance, in the above example, Node D might send E a via list
          containing only the private ID (I). E would then use the destination
          list (D, I) to send its return message. When D processes this
          destination list, it would detect that I is a private ID, recover
          the via list (A, B, C), and reverse that to produce the correct
          destination list (C, B, A) before sending it to C. This feature is
          called List Compression. It MAY either be a compressed version of
          the original via list or an index into a state database containing
          the original via list.
</p>
<p>No matter what mechanism for storing via list state is used, if
          an intermediate peer exits the overlay, then on the return trip the
          message cannot be forwarded and will be dropped. The ordinary
          timeout and retransmission mechanisms provide stability over this
          type of failure.
</p>
<p>Note that if an intermediate peer retains per-transaction state
          instead of modifying the via list, it needs some mechanism for
          timing out that state, otherwise its state database will grow
          without bound. Whatever algorithm is used, state MUST be maintained
          for at least the value of the overlay reliability timer (3 seconds)
          and MAY be kept longer.

Private ID</h3>

<p>If the first entry in the destination list is a private id (e.g.,

        messages through the overlay. All implementations MUST implement this

        on a per-message basis.

Request Origination</h3>

<p>In order to originate a message to a given Node-ID or
          Resource-ID, a node constructs an appropriate destination list. The
          simplest such destination list is a single entry containing the
          Node-ID or Resource-ID. The resulting message will use the normal
          overlay routing mechanisms to forward the message to that
          destination. The node can also construct a more complicated
          destination list for source routing.
</p>
<p>Once the message is constructed, the node sends the message to
          some adjacent peer. If the first entry on the destination list is
          directly connected, then the message MUST be routed down that
          connection. Otherwise, the topology plugin MUST be consulted to
          determine the appropriate next hop.
</p>
<p>Parallel searches for the resource are a common solution to
          improve reliability in the face of churn or of subversive peers.
          Parallel searches for usage-specified replicas are managed by the
          usage layer. However, a single request can also be routed through
          multiple adjacent peers, even when known to be sub-optimal, to
          improve reliability <a class='info' href='#vulnerabilities-acsac04'>[vulnerabilities&#8209;acsac04]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Srivatsa, M. and L. Liu, &ldquo;Vulnerabilities and Security Threats in Structured           Peer-to-Peer Systems: A Quantitative Analysis,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>.
          Such parallel searches MAY BE specified by the topology plugin.
</p>
<p>Because messages may be lost in transit through the overlay,
          RELOAD incorporates an end-to-end reliability mechanism. When an
          originating node transmits a request it MUST set a 3 second timer.
          If a response has not been received when the timer fires, the
          request is retransmitted with the same transaction identifier. The
          request MAY be retransmitted up to 4 times (for a total of 5
          messages). After the timer for the fifth transmission fires, the
          message SHALL be considered to have failed. Note that this
          retransmission procedure is not followed by intermediate nodes. They
          follow the hop-by-hop reliability procedure described in <a class='info' href='#sec-reliability'>Section&nbsp;5.6.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Simple Reliability</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>The above algorithm can result in multiple requests being
          delivered to a node. Receiving nodes MUST generate semantically
          equivalent responses to retransmissions of the same request (this
          can be determined by transaction id) if the request is received
          within the maximum request lifetime (15 seconds). For some requests
          (e.g., Fetch) this can be accomplished merely by processing the
          request again. For other requests, (e.g., Store) it may be necessary
          to maintain state for the duration of the request lifetime.

<p>When a peer sends a response to a request using this routing

Message Structure</h3>

<p>RELOAD is a message-oriented request/response protocol. The

        use Type, Length, Value fields to allow for extensibility. However,
        for the parts of a structure that were required in all messages, we
        just define these in a fixed position, as adding a type and length for
        them is unnecessary and would simply increase bandwidth and introduces
        new potential for interoperability issues.

<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>It familiar enough looking that most readers can grasp it
              quickly.
</li>
<li>The ability to define nested structures allows a separation

</li>
<li>It has a straightforward wire encoding that allows quick

</li>
<li>The ability to mechanically compile encoders and

Common Definitions</h3>

<p>The following definitions are used throughout RELOAD and so are
            defined here. They also provide a convenient introduction to how
            to read the presentation language.
</p>
<p>An enum represents an enumerated type. The values associated
            with each possibility are represented in parentheses and the
            maximum value is represented as a nameless value, for purposes of
            describing the width of the containing integral type. For
            instance, Boolean represents a true or false:
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
      enum { false (0), true(1), (255)} Boolean;

</pre></div>
<p>A boolean value is either a 1 or a 0. The max value of 255
            indicates this is represented as a single byte on the wire.
</p>
<p>The NodeId, shown below, represents a single Node-ID.
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>

          typedef opaque       NodeId[NodeIdLength];

</pre></div>
<p>A NodeId is a fixed-length structure represented as a series of
            bytes, with the most significant byte first. The length is set on
            a per-overlay basis within the range of 16-20 bytes (128 to 160
            bits). (See <a class='info' href='#sec-configuration'>Section&nbsp;10.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Overlay Configuration</span><span>)</span></a> for how
            NodeIdLength is set.) Note: the use of "typedef" here is an
            extension to the TLS language, but its meaning should be
            relatively obvious. Note the [ size ] syntax defines a fixed
            length element that does not include the length of the element in
            the on the wire encoding.
</p>
<p>A ResourceId, shown below, represents a single Resource-ID.
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>

          typedef opaque       ResourceId&lt;0..2^8-1&gt;;

</pre></div>
<p>Like a NodeId, a ResourceId is an opaque string of bytes, but
            unlike NodeIds, ResourceIds are variable length, up to 255 bytes
            (2048 bits) in length. On the wire, each ResourceId is preceded by
            a single length byte (allowing lengths up to 255). Thus, the
            3-byte value "FOO" would be encoded as: 03 46 4f 4f. Note the &lt;
            range &gt; syntax defines a variable length element that does
            include the length of the element in the on the wire encoding. The
            number of bytes to encode the length on the wire is derived by
            range; i.e., it is the minimum number of bytes which can encode
            the largest range value.

<p>A more complicated example is IpAddressPort, which represents a
            network address and can be used to carry either an IPv6 or IPv4
            address:
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>

     enum {reservedAddr(0), ipv4_address (1), ipv6_address (2),
          (255)} AddressType;

     struct  {
       uint32                  addr;
       uint16                  port;
     } IPv4AddrPort;

     struct  {
       uint128                 addr;
       uint16                  port;
     } IPv6AddrPort;


     struct {
       AddressType             type;
       uint8                   length;

       select (type) {
         case ipv4_address:
            IPv4AddrPort       v4addr_port;

         case ipv6_address:
            IPv6AddrPort       v6addr_port;

         /* This structure can be extended */

      } IpAddressPort;

</pre></div>
<p>The first two fields in the structure are the same no matter
            what kind of address is being represented:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>type:</dt>
<dd>the type of address (v4 or v6).
</dd>
<dt>length:</dt>
<dd>the length of the rest of the
                structure.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>By having the type and the length appear at the beginning of
            the structure regardless of the kind of address being represented,
            an implementation which does not understand new address type X can
            still parse the IpAddressPort field and then discard it if it is
            not needed.
</p>
<p>The rest of the IpAddressPort structure is either an
            IPv4AddrPort or an IPv6AddrPort. Both of these simply consist of
            an address represented as an integer and a 16-bit port. As an
            example, here is the wire representation of the IPv4 address
            "192.0.2.1" with port "6100".
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
          01           ; type    = IPv4
          06           ; length  = 6
          c0 00 02 01  ; address = 192.0.2.1
          17 d4        ; port    = 6100
</pre></div>
<p>Unless a given structure that uses a select explicitly allows
            for unknown types in the select, any unknown type SHOULD be
            treated as an parsing error and the whole message discarded with
            no response.

Processing Configuration Sequence Numbers</h3>

<p>In order to be part of the overlay, a node MUST have a copy of
            the overlay configuration document. In order to allow for
            configuration document changes, each version of the configuration
            document has a sequence number which is monotonically increasing
            mod 65536. Because the sequence number may in principle wrap,
            greater than or less than are interpreted by modulo arithmetic as
            in TCP.
</p>
<p>When a destination node receives a request, it MUST check that
            the configuration_sequence field is equal to its own configuration
            sequence number. If they do not match, it MUST generate an error,
            either Error_Config_Too_Old or Error_Config_Too_New. In addition,
            if the configuration file in the request is too old, it MUST
            generate a ConfigUpdate message to update the requesting node.
            This allows new configuration documents to propagate quickly
            throughout the system. The one exception to this rule is that if
            the configuration_sequence field is equal to 0xffff, and the
            message type is ConfigUpdate, then the message MUST be accepted
            regardless of the receiving node's configuration sequence number.
            Since 65535 is a special value, peers sending a new configuration
            when the configuration sequence is currently 65534 MUST set the
            configuration sequence number to 0 when they send out a new
            configuration.

<p>One possible encoding of the 16 bit integer version as an
            opaque identifier is to encode an index into a connection table.
            To avoid misrouting responses in the event a response is delayed
            and the connection table entry has changed, the identifier SHOULD
            be split between an index and a generation counter for that index.
            At startup, the generation counters should be initialized to
            random values. An implementation could use 12 bits for the
            connection table index and 3 bits for the generation counter.
            (Note that this does not suggest a 4096 entry connection table for
            every node, only the ability to encode for a larger connection
            table.) When a connection table slot is used for a new connection,
            the generation counter is incremented (with wrapping). Connection
            table slots are used on a rotating basis to maximize the time
            interval between uses of the same slot for different connections.
            When routing a message to an entry in the destination list
            encoding a connection table entry, the node confirms that the
            generation counter matches the current generation counter of that
            index before forwarding the message. If it does not match, the
            message is silently dropped.

<p>This option can only be used if the
            direct-return-response-permitted flag in the configuration for the
            overlay is set to TRUE. The RESPONSE_COPY flag SHOULD be set to
            false while the FORWARD_CRITICAL and DESTINATION_CRITICAL MUST be
            set to true. When a node that supports this forwarding options
            receives a request with it, it acts as if it had send an Attach
            request to the requesting_node and it had received the
            connection_information in the answer. This causes it to form a new
            connection directly to that node. Once that is complete the
            response to this request is sent over that connection. If a
            connection already exists directly to that node, it is used
            instead of a new connection being formed. The connection MAY be
            closed at any point but is typically kept open until it has not
            been used for a significant period of time or one of the nodes
            needs to reclaim resources.

Response Codes and Response Errors</h3>

<p>A peer processing a request returns its status in the

<p>The third part of a RELOAD message is the security block. The

enum { x509(0), (255) } certificate_type;

struct {
   certificate_type    type;

} GenericCertificate;

struct {
   GenericCertificate certificates&lt;0..2^16-1&gt;;
   Signature          signature;
} SecurityBlock;
</pre></div>
<p>The contents of this structure are:

</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>A signature over the message contents.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>The certificates bucket SHOULD contain all the certificates
          necessary to verify every signature in both the message and the
          internal message objects. This is the only location in the message
          which contains certificates, thus allowing for only a single copy of
          each certificate to be sent. In systems which have some alternate
          certificate distribution mechanism, some certificates MAY be
          omitted. However, implementors should note that this creates the
          possibility that messages may not be immediately verifiable because
          certificates must first be retrieved.
</p>
<p>Each certificate is represented by a GenericCertificate
          structure, which has the following contents:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt>type</dt>
<dd>
</dd>

</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt>certificate</dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>The encoded version of the certificate. For X.509
              certificates, it is the DER form.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>The signature is computed over the payload and parts of the
          forwarding header. The payload, in case of a Store, may contain an
          additional signature computed over a StoreReq structure. All
          signatures are formatted using the Signature element. This element
          is also used in other contexts where signatures are needed. The
          input structure to the signature computation varies depending on the
          data element being signed.
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>

  } Signature;
</pre></div>
<p>The signature construct contains the following values:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd>

<dt>algorithm </dt>

</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>The value of the signature.

</dl></blockquote>

<p>The only currently permitted identity format is a hash of the
          signer's certificate. The hash_alg field is used to indicate the
          algorithm used to produce the hash. The certificate_hash contains
          the hash of the certificate object. The SignerIdentity structure is
          typed purely to allow for future (unanticipated) extensibility.
</p>
<p>For signatures over messages the input to the signature is
          computed over:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>overlay + transaction_id + MessageContents +
              SignerIdentity
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>where overlay and transaction_id come from the forwarding header
          and + indicates concatenation.
</p>
<p>The input to signatures over data values is different, and is
          described in <a class='info' href='#sec-data-sig'>Section&nbsp;6.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Data Signature Computation</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>All RELOAD messages MUST be signed. Upon receipt, the receiving
          node MUST verify the signature and the authorizing certificate. This
          check provides a minimal level of assurance that the sending node is
          a valid part of the overlay as well as cryptographic authentication
          of the sending node. In addition, responses MUST be checked as
          follows:
</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>The response to a message sent to a specific Node-ID MUST
              have been sent by that Node-ID.
</li>
<li>The response to a message sent to a Resource-Id MUST have
              been sent by a Node-ID which is as close to or closer to the
              target Resource-Id than any node in the requesting node's
              neighbor table.
</li>
</ol>

<p>The second condition serves as a primitive check for responses
          from wildly wrong nodes but is not a complete check. Note that in
          periods of churn, it is possible for the requesting node to obtain a
          closer neighbor while the request is outstanding. This will cause
          the response to be rejected and the request to be retransmitted.
</p>
<p>In addition, some methods (especially Store) have additional
          authentication requirements, which are described in the sections
          covering those methods.

Overlay Topology</h3>

<p>As discussed in previous sections, RELOAD does not itself implement
        any overlay topology. Rather, it relies on Topology Plugins, which
        allow a variety of overlay algorithms to be used while maintaining the
        same RELOAD core. This section describes the requirements for new
        topology plugins and the methods that RELOAD provides for overlay

<a name="rfc.section.5.4.1"></a><h3>5.4.1.&nbsp;
Topology Plugin Requirements</h3>

<p>When specifying a new overlay algorithm, at least the following
          need to be described:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Joining procedures, including the contents of the Join
              message.
</li>
<li>Stabilization procedures, including the contents of the
              Update message, the frequency of topology probes and keepalives,
              and the mechanism used to detect when peers have
              disconnected.
</li>
<li>Exit procedures, including the contents of the Leave
              message.
</li>
<li>The length of the Resource-IDs. For DHTs, the hash algorithm
              to compute the hash of an identifier.
</li>
<li>The procedures that peers use to route messages.
</li>
<li>The replication strategy used to ensure data redundancy.
</li>
</ul>

<p>All overlay algorithms MUST specify maintenance procedures that
          send Updates to clients and peers that have established connections
          to the peer responsible for a particular ID when the responsibility
          for that ID changes. Because tracking this information is difficult,
          overlay algorithms MAY simply specify that an Update is sent to all
          members of the Connection Table whenever the range of IDs for which
          the peer is responsible changes.

            the topology plugin. This notifies the responsible peer that the
            new peer is taking over some of the overlay and it needs to
            synchronize its state.

<p>The minimal JoinReq contains only the Node-ID which the sending

      } JoinAns;
</pre></div>
<p>If the request succeeds, the responding peer MUST follow up by
            executing the right sequence of Stores and Updates to transfer the
            appropriate section of the overlay space to the joining peer. In
            addition, overlay algorithms MAY define data to appear in the
            response payload that provides additional info.
</p>
<p>In general, nodes which cannot form connections SHOULD report
            an error. However, implementations MUST provide some mechanism
            whereby nodes can determine that they are potentially the first
            node and take responsibility for the overlay. This specification
            does not mandate any particular mechanism, but a configuration
            flag or setting seems appropriate.

Update</h3>

<p>Update is the primary overlay-specific maintenance message. It
            is used by the sender to notify the recipient of the sender's view
            of the current state of the overlay (its routing state), and it is
            up to the recipient to take whatever actions are appropriate to
            deal with the state change. In general, peers send Update messages
            to all their adjacencies whenever they detect a topology
            shift.
</p>
<p>When a peer detects through an Update that it is no longer
            responsible for any data value it is storing, it MUST attempt to
            Store a copy to the correct node unless it knows the newly
            responsible node already has a copy of the data. This prevents
            data loss during large-scale topology shifts such as the merging
            of partitioned overlays.
</p>
<p>The contents of the UpdateReq message are completely
            overlay-specific. The UpdateAns response is expected to be either
            success or an error.

Route_Query</h3>

<p>The Route_Query request allows the sender to ask a peer where
            they would route a message directed to a given destination. In
            other words, a RouteQuery for a destination X requests the Node-ID
            for the node that the receiving peer would next route to in order
            to get to X. A RouteQuery can also request that the receiving peer
            initiate an Update request to transfer the receiving peer's
            routing table.
</p>
<p>One important use of the RouteQuery request is to support
            iterative routing. The sender selects one of the peers in its
            routing table and sends it a RouteQuery message with the
            destination_object set to the Node-ID or Resource-ID it wishes to
            route to. The receiving peer responds with information about the
            peers to which the request would be routed. The sending peer MAY
            then use the Attach method to attach to that peer(s), and repeat
            the RouteQuery. Eventually, the sender gets a response from a peer
            that is closest to the identifier in the destination_object as
            determined by the topology plugin. At that point, the sender can
            send messages directly to that peer.

Attach</h3>

<p>A node sends an Attach request when it wishes to establish a
          direct TCP or UDP connection to another node for the purpose of
          sending RELOAD messages.
</p>
<p>As described in <a class='info' href='#sec-message-forwarding'>Section&nbsp;5.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Message Receipt and Forwarding</span><span>)</span></a>, an
          Attach may be routed to either a Node-ID or to a Resource-ID. An
          Attach routed to a specific Node-ID will fail if that node is not
          reached. An Attach routed to a Resource-ID will establish a
          connection with the peer currently responsible for that Resource-ID,
          which may be useful in establishing a direct connection to the
          responsible peer for use with frequent or large resource
          updates.
</p>
<p>An Attach in and of itself does not result in updating the
          routing table of either node. That function is performed by Updates.
          If node A has Attached to node B, but not received any Updates from
          B, it MAY route messages which are directly addressed to B through
          that channel but MUST NOT route messages through B to other peers
          via that channel. The process of Attaching is separate from the
          process of becoming a peer (using Join and Update), to prevent
          half-open states where a node has started to form connections but is
          not really ready to act as a peer. Thus, clients (unlike peers) can
          simply Attach without sending Join or Update.

            A peer which is overloaded or detects some other kind of error may

Using ICE With RELOAD</h3>

            used to carry the ICE parameters. In RELOAD, this function is
            performed by a binary encoding in the Attach method. This encoding
            is more restricted than the SDP encoding because the RELOAD
            environment is simpler:

<ul class="text">
<li>Only a single media stream is supported.

<li>In this case, the "stream" refers not to RTP or other types

<a name="rfc.section.5.5.1.4"></a><h3>5.5.1.4.&nbsp;
Collecting STUN Servers</h3>

<p>ICE relies on the node having one or more STUN servers to use.
            In conventional ICE, it is assumed that nodes are configured with
            one or more STUN servers through some out of band mechanism. This
            is still possible in RELOAD but RELOAD also learns STUN servers as
            it connects to other peers. Because all RELOAD peers implement ICE
            and use STUN keepalives, every peer is a STUN server <a class='info' href='#RFC5389'>[RFC5389]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., Mahy, R., Matthews, P., and D. Wing, &ldquo;Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN),&rdquo; October&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>. Accordingly, any peer a node knows will
            be willing to be a STUN server -- though of course it may be
            behind a NAT.
</p>
<p>A peer on a well-provisioned wide-area overlay will be
            configured with one or more bootstrap nodes. These nodes make an
            initial list of STUN servers. However, as the peer forms
            connections with additional peers, it builds more peers it can use
            as STUN servers.
</p>
<p>Because complicated NAT topologies are possible, a peer may
            need more than one STUN server. Specifically, a peer that is
            behind a single NAT will typically observe only two IP addresses
            in its STUN checks: its local address and its server reflexive
            address from a STUN server outside its NAT. However, if there are
            more NATs involved, it may learn additional server reflexive
            addresses (which vary based on where in the topology the STUN
            server is). To maximize the chance of achieving a direct
            connection, a peer SHOULD group other peers by the peer-reflexive
            addresses it discovers through them. It SHOULD then select one
            peer from each group to use as a STUN server for future
            connections.
</p>
<p>Only peers to which the peer currently has connections may be
            used. If the connection to that host is lost, it MUST be removed
            from the list of stun servers and a new server from the same group
            MUST be selected unless there are no others servers in the group in
            which case some other peer MAY be used.

<a name="rfc.section.5.5.1.5"></a><h3>5.5.1.5.&nbsp;
Gathering Candidates</h3>

<p>When a node wishes to establish a connection for the purposes
            of RELOAD signaling or application signaling, it follows the
            process of gathering candidates as described in Section 4 of ICE
            <a class='info' href='#RFC5245'>[RFC5245]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., &ldquo;Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE): A Protocol for Network Address Translator (NAT) Traversal for Offer/Answer Protocols,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>. RELOAD utilizes a single
            component. Consequently, gathering for these "streams" requires a
            single component. In the case where a node has not yet found a
            TURN server, the agent would not include a relayed candidate.
</p>
<p>The ICE specification assumes that an ICE agent is configured
            with, or somehow knows of, TURN and STUN servers. RELOAD provides
            a way for an agent to learn these by querying the overlay, as
            described in <a class='info' href='#sec-collect'>Section&nbsp;5.5.1.4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Collecting STUN Servers</span><span>)</span></a> and <a class='info' href='#sec-turn-server'>Section&nbsp;8<span> (</span><span class='info'>TURN Server Usage</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>The default candidate selection described in Section 4.1.4 of
            ICE is ignored; defaults are not signaled or utilized by
            RELOAD.
</p>
<p>An alternative to using the full ICE supported by the Attach
            request is to use No-ICE mechanism by providing candidates with
            "No-ICE" Overlay Link protocols. Configuration for the overlay
            indicates whether or not these Overlay Link protocols can be used.
            An overlay MUST be either all ICE or all No-ICE.
</p>
<p>No-ICE will not work in all of the scenarios where ICE would
            work, but in some cases, particularly those with no NATs or
            firewalls, it will work. Therefore it is RECOMMENDED that full ICE
            be used even for a node that has a public, unfiltered IP address,
            to take advantage of STUN connectivity checks, etc.

Prioritizing Candidates</h3>

<p>At the time of writing, UDP is the only transport protocol
            specified to work with ICE. However, standardization of additional
            protocols for use with ICE is expected, including TCP and
            datagram-oriented protocols such as SCTP and DCCP. In particular,
            UDP encapsulations for SCTP and DCCP are expected to be
            standardized in the near future, greatly expanding the available
            Overlay Link protocols available for RELOAD. When additional
            protocols are available, the following prioritization is
            RECOMMENDED:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Highest priority is assigned to message-oriented protocols
                that offer well-understood congestion and flow control without
                head of line blocking. For example, SCTP without message
                ordering, DCCP, or those protocols encapsulated using UDP.
</li>
<li>Second highest priority is assigned to stream-oriented
                protocols, e.g. TCP.
</li>
<li>Lowest priority is assigned to protocols encapsulated over
                UDP that do not implement well-established congestion control
                algorithms. The DTLS/UDP with SR overlay link protocol is an
                example of such a protocol.

Encoding the Attach Message</h3>

<p>Section 4.3 of ICE describes procedures for encoding the SDP
            for conveying RELOAD candidates. Instead of actually encoding an
            SDP, the candidate information (IP address and port and transport
            protocol, priority, foundation, type and related address) is
            carried within the attributes of the Attach request or its
            response. Similarly, the username fragment and password are
            carried in the Attach message or its response. <a class='info' href='#sec-connect-details'>Section&nbsp;5.5.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Attach</span><span>)</span></a> describes the detailed
            attribute encoding for Attach. The Attach request and its response
            do not contain any default candidates or the ice-lite attribute,
            as these features of ICE are not used by RELOAD.
</p>
<p>Since the Attach request contains the candidate information and
            short term credentials, it is considered as an offer for a single
            media stream that happens to be encoded in a format different than
            SDP, but is otherwise considered a valid offer for the purposes of
            following the ICE specification. Similarly, the Attach response is
            considered a valid answer for the purposes of following the ICE
            specification.

Verifying ICE Support</h3>

<p>An agent MUST skip the verification procedures in Section 5.1

            this check is not required.

Role Determination</h3>

<p>The roles of controlling and controlled as described in Section
            5.2 of ICE are still utilized with RELOAD. However, the offerer
            (the entity sending the Attach request) will always be
            controlling, and the answerer (the entity sending the Attach
            response) will always be controlled. The connectivity checks MUST
            still contain the ICE-CONTROLLED and ICE-CONTROLLING attributes,
            however, even though the role reversal capability for which they
            are defined will never be needed with RELOAD. This is to allow for
            a common codebase between ICE for RELOAD and ICE for SDP.

            connectivity check. The certificate exchanged during the (D)TLS

Sending Media</h3>

<p>The procedures of Section 11 of ICE apply to RELOAD as well.
            However, in this case, the "media" takes the form of application
            layer protocols (RELOAD or SIP for example) over TLS or DTLS.
            Consequently, once ICE processing completes, the agent will begin
            TLS or DTLS procedures to establish a secure connection. The node
            which sent the Attach request MUST be the TLS server. The other
            node MUST be the TLS client. The server MUST request TLS client
            authentication. The nodes MUST verify that the certificate
            presented in the handshake matches the identity of the other peer
            as found in the Attach message. Once the TLS or DTLS signaling is
            complete, the application protocol is free to use the
            connection.
</p>
<p>The concept of a previous selected pair for a component does

Overlay Link Layer</h3>

<p>RELOAD can use multiple Overlay Link protocols to send its
        messages. Because ICE is used to establish connections (see <a class='info' href='#sec-ice-reload'>Section&nbsp;5.5.1.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Using ICE With RELOAD</span><span>)</span></a>), RELOAD nodes are able to detect
        which Overlay Link protocols are offered by other nodes and establish
        connections between them. Any link protocol needs to be able to
        establish a secure, authenticated connection and to provide data
        origin authentication and message integrity for individual data
        elements. RELOAD currently supports three Overlay Link protocols:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>DTLS <a class='info' href='#RFC4347'>[RFC4347]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rescorla, E. and N. Modadugu, &ldquo;Datagram Transport Layer Security,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> over UDP with Simple
            Reliability (SR)
</li>
<li>TLS <a class='info' href='#RFC5246'>[RFC5246]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Dierks, T. and E. Rescorla, &ldquo;The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> over TCP with Framing
            Header, No-ICE
</li>
<li>DTLS <a class='info' href='#RFC4347'>[RFC4347]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rescorla, E. and N. Modadugu, &ldquo;Datagram Transport Layer Security,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> over UDP with SR,
            No-ICE
</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that although UDP does not properly have "connections", both
        TLS and DTLS have a handshake which establishes a similar, stateful
        association, and we simply refer to these as "connections" for the
        purposes of this document.
</p>
<p>If a peer receives a message that is larger than value of
        max-message-size defined in the overlay configuration, the peer SHOULD
        send an Error_Message_Too_Large error and then close the TLS or DTLS
        session from which the message was received. Note that this error can
        be sent and the session closed before receiving the complete message.
        If the forwarding header is larger than the max-message-size, the
        receiver SHOULD close the TLS or DTLS session without sending an
        error.
</p>
<p>The Framing Header (FH) is used to frame messages and provide
        timing when used on a reliable stream-based transport protocol. Simple
        Reliability (SR) makes use of the FH to provide congestion control and
        semi-reliability when using unreliable message-oriented transport
        protocols. We will first define each of these algorithms, then define
        overlay link protocols that use them.
</p>
<p>Note: We expect future Overlay Link protocols to define
        replacements for all components of these protocols, including the
        framing header. These protocols have been chosen for simplicity of
        implementation and reasonable performance.
</p>
<p>Note to implementers: There are inherent tradeoffs in utilizing
        short timeouts to determine when a link has failed. To balance the
        tradeoffs, an implementation should be able to quickly act to remove
        entries from the routing table when there is reason to suspect the
        link has failed. For example, in a Chord-derived overlay algorithm, a
        closer finger table entry could be substituted for an entry in the
        finger table that has experienced a timeout. That entry can be
        restored if it proves to resume functioning, or replaced at some point
        in the future if necessary. End-to-end retransmissions will handle any
        lost messages, but only if the failing entries do not remain in the
        finger table for subsequent retransmissions.

            implementation. Currently SCTP, DCCP, and a generic tunneling
            extension are being proposed for message-oriented protocols. Baset
            et al. have proposed tunneling TCP over UDP for similar reasons

Framing Header</h3>

<p>In order to support unreliable links and to allow for quick
          detection of link failures when using reliable end-to-end
          transports, each message is wrapped in a very simple framing layer
          (FramedMessage) which is only used for each hop. This layer contains
          a sequence number which can then be used for ACKs. The same header
          is used for both reliable and unreliable transports for simplicity
          of implementation - not all aspects of the header apply to both
          types of transports.
</p>
<p>The definition of FramedMessage is:
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>

     enum { data(128), ack(129), (255)} FramedMessageType;

     struct {
       FramedMessageType       type;

       select (type) {
         case data:
           uint32              sequence;
           opaque              message&lt;0..2^24-1&gt;;

         case ack:
           uint32              ack_sequence;
           uint32              received;
       };
     } FramedMessage;


</pre></div>
<p>The type field of the PDU is set to indicate whether the message
          is data or an acknowledgement.
</p>
<p>If the message is of type "data", then the remainder of the PDU
          is as follows: </p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt>sequence </dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>the sequence number. This increments by 1 for each framed
              message sent over this transport session.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt>message </dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>the message that is being transmitted.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>Each connection has it own sequence number space. Initially the
          value is zero and it increments by exactly one for each message sent
          over that connection.
</p>
<p>When the receiver receives a message, it SHOULD immediately send
          an ACK message. The receiver MUST keep track of the 32 most recent
          sequence numbers received on this association in order to generate
          the appropriate ack.
</p>
<p>If the PDU is of type "ack", the contents are as follows: </p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt>ack_sequence </dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>The sequence number of the message being acknowledged.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt>received </dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>A bitmask indicating if each of the previous 32 sequence
              numbers before this packet has been among the 32 packets most
              recently received on this connection. When a packet is received
              with a sequence number N, the receiver looks at the sequence
              number of the previously 32 packets received on this connection.
              Call the previously received packet number M. For each of the
              previous 32 packets, if the sequence number M is less than N but
              greater than N-32, the N-M bit of the received bitmask is set to
              one; otherwise it is zero. Note that a bit being set to one
              indicates positively that a particular packet was received, but
              a bit being set to zero means only that it is unknown whether or
              not the packet has been received, because it might have been
              received before the 32 most recently received packets.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>The received field bits in the ACK provide a high degree of
          redundancy so that the sender can figure out which packets the
          receiver has received and can then estimate packet loss rates. If
          the sender also keeps track of the time at which recent sequence

Simple Reliability</h3>

<p>When RELOAD is carried over DTLS or another unreliable link
          protocol, it needs to be used with a reliability and congestion
          control mechanism, which is provided on a hop-by-hop basis. The
          basic principle is that each message, regardless of whether or not
          it carries a request or response, will get an ACK and be reliably
          retransmitted. The receiver's job is very simple, limited to just
          sending ACKs. All the complexity is at the sender side. This allows
          the sending implementation to trade off performance versus
          implementation complexity without affecting the wire protocol.

Retransmission and Flow Control</h3>

<p>Because the receiver's role is limited to providing packet
            acknowledgements, a wide variety of congestion control algorithms
            can be implemented on the sender side while using the same basic
            wire protocol. Senders MUST implement a retransmission and
            congestion control scheme no more aggressive then TFRC<a class='info' href='#RFC5348'>[RFC5348]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Floyd, S., Handley, M., Padhye, J., and J. Widmer, &ldquo;TCP Friendly Rate Control (TFRC): Protocol Specification,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>. One way to do that is for senders to
            implement the scheme in the following section. Another alternative
            would be TFRC-SP <a class='info' href='#RFC4828'>[RFC4828]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Floyd, S. and E. Kohler, &ldquo;TCP Friendly Rate Control (TFRC): The Small-Packet (SP) Variant,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> and use the
            received bitmask to allow the sender to compute packet loss event
            rates.

Trivial Retransmission</h3>

<p>A peer SHOULD retransmit a message if it has not received an
              ACK after an interval of RTO ("Retransmission TimeOut"). The
              peer MUST double the time to wait after each retransmission. In
              each retransmission, the sequence number is incremented.
</p>
<p>The RTO is an estimate of the round-trip time (RTT).
              Implementations can use a static value for RTO or a dynamic
              estimate which will result in better performance. For
              implementations that use a static value, the default value for
              RTO is 500 ms. Nodes MAY use smaller values of RTO if it is
              known that all nodes are within the local network. The default
              RTO MAY be chosen larger, and this is RECOMMENDED if it is known
              in advance (such as on high latency access links) that the
              round-trip time is larger.
</p>
<p>Implementations that use a dynamic estimate to compute the
              RTO MUST use the algorithm described in RFC 2988<a class='info' href='#RFC2988'>[RFC2988]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Paxson, V. and M. Allman, &ldquo;Computing TCP's Retransmission Timer,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a>, with the exception that the value of
              RTO SHOULD NOT be rounded up to the nearest second but instead
              rounded up to the nearest millisecond. The RTT of a successful
              STUN transaction from the ICE stage is used as the initial
              measurement for formula 2.2 of RFC 2988. The sender keeps track
              of the time each message was sent for all recently sent
              messages. Any time an ACK is received, the sender can compute
              the RTT for that message by looking at the time the ACK was
              received and the time when the message was sent. This is used as
              a subsequent RTT measurement for formula 2.3 of RFC 2988 to
              update the RTO estimate. (Note that because retransmissions
              receive new sequence numbers, all received ACKs are used.)
</p>
<p>The value for RTO is calculated separately for each DTLS
              session.
</p>
<p>Retransmissions continue until a response is received, or
              until a total of 5 requests have been sent or there has been a
              hard ICMP error <a class='info' href='#RFC1122'>[RFC1122]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Braden, R., &ldquo;Requirements for Internet Hosts - Communication Layers,&rdquo; October&nbsp;1989.</span><span>)</span></a> or a TLS alert.
              The sender knows a response was received when it receives an ACK
              with a sequence number that indicates it is a response to one of
              the transmissions of this messages. For example, assuming an RTO
              of 500 ms, requests would be sent at times 0 ms, 500 ms, 1500
              ms, 3500 ms, and 7500 ms. If all retransmissions for a message
              fail, then the sending node SHOULD close the connection routing
              the message.
</p>
<p>To determine when a link may be failing without waiting for
              the final timeout, observe when no ACKs have been received for
              an entire RTO interval, and then wait for three retransmissions
              to occur beyond that point. If no ACKs have been received by the
              time the third retransmission occurs, it is RECOMMENDED that the
              link be removed from the routing table. The link MAY be restored
              to the routing table if ACKs resume before the connection is
              closed, as described above.
</p>
<p>Once an ACK has been received for a message, the next message
              can be sent, but the peer SHOULD ensure that there is at least
              10 ms between sending any two messages. The only time a value
              less than 10 ms can be used is when it is known that all nodes
              are on a network that can support retransmissions faster than 10
              ms with no congestion issues.

Fragmentation and Reassembly</h3>

<p>In order to allow transmission over datagram protocols such as
        DTLS, RELOAD messages may be fragmented.
</p>
<p>Any node along the path can fragment the message but only the final
        destination reassembles the fragments. When a node takes a packet and
        fragments it, each fragment has a full copy of the Forwarding Header
        but the data after the Forwarding Header is broken up in appropriate
        sized chunks. The size of the payload chunks needs to take into
        account space to allow the via and destination lists to grow. Each
        fragment MUST contain a full copy of the via and destination list and
        MUST contain at least 256 bytes of the message body. If the via and
        destination list are so large that this is not possible, RELOAD
        fragmentation is not performed and IP-layer fragmentation is allowed
        to occur. When a message must be fragmented, it SHOULD be split into
        equal-sized fragments that are no larger than the PMTU of the next
        overlay link minus 32 bytes. This is to allow the via list to grow
        before further fragmentation is required.
</p>
<p>Note that this fragmentation is not optimal for the end-to-end path
        - a message may be refragmented multiple times as it traverses the
        overlay. This option has been chosen as it is far easier to implement
        than e2e PMTU discovery across an ever-changing overlay, and it
        effectively addresses the reliability issues of relying on IP-layer
        fragmentation. However, PING can be used to allow e2e PMTU to be
        implemented if desired.
</p>
<p>Upon receipt of a fragmented message by the intended peer, the peer
        holds the fragments in a holding buffer until the entire message has
        been received. The message is then reassembled into a single message
        and processed. In order to mitigate denial of service attacks,
        receivers SHOULD time out incomplete fragments after maximum request
        lifetime (15 seconds). Note this time was derived from looking at the
        end to end retransmission time and saving fragments long enough for
        the full end to end retransmissions to take place. Ideally the
        receiver would have enough buffer space to deal with as many fragments
        as can arrive in the maximum request lifetime. However, if the
        receiver runs out of buffer space to reassemble the messages it MUST
        drop the message.
</p>
<p>When a message is fragmented, the fragment offset value is stored
        in the lower 24 bits of the fragment field of the forwarding header.
        The offset is the number of bytes between the end of the forwarding
        header and the start of the data. The first fragment therefore has an
        offset of 0. The first and last bit indicators MUST be appropriately
        set. If the message is not fragmented, then both the first and last
        fragment bits are set to 1 and the offset is 0 resulting in a fragment
        value of 0xC0000000.

Data Storage Protocol</h3>

<p>RELOAD provides a set of generic mechanisms for storing and

      for new applications simply by defining new code points and a small set
      of rules. No new protocol mechanisms are required.
</p>
<p>The basic unit of stored data is a single StoredData structure:

          storage time before that of a value already stored at this location
          MUST generate a Error_Data_Too_Old error. This prevents rollback
          attacks. Note that this does not require synchronized clocks: the

Access Control Policies</h3>

<p>Every kind which is storable in an overlay MUST be associated with
        an access control policy. This policy defines whether a request from a
        given node to operate on a given value should succeed or fail. It is
        anticipated that only a small number of generic access control
        policies are required. To that end, this section describes a small set
        of such policies and <a class='info' href='#sec.iana.access_control'>Section&nbsp;13.4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Access Control Policies</span><span>)</span></a>
        establishes a registry for new policies if required. Each policy has a
        short string identifier which is used to reference it in the
        configuration document.

Request Definition</h3>

<p>A StoreReq message is a sequence of StoreKindData values, each
            of which represents a sequence of stored values for a given kind.
            The same Kind-ID MUST NOT be used twice in a given store request.
            Each value is then processed in turn. These operations MUST be
            atomic. If any operation fails, the state MUST be rolled back to
            before the request was received.
</p>
<p>The store request is defined by the StoreReq structure:
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
    struct {
        KindId                 kind;

        StoredData             values&lt;0..2^32-1&gt;;
    } StoreKindData;

    struct {
        ResourceId             resource;
        uint8                  replica_number;
        StoreKindData          kind_data&lt;0..2^32-1&gt;;
    } StoreReq;

</pre></div>
<p>A single Store request stores data of a number of kinds to a
            single resource location. The contents of the structure are: </p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>

<dd>The number of this replica. When a storing peer saves
                replicas to other peers each peer is assigned a replica number
                starting from 1 and sent in the Store message. This field is
                set to 0 when a node is storing its own data. This allows
                peers to distinguish replica writes from original writes.

<dd>

<dt></dt>
<dd>A series of elements, one for each kind of data to be
                stored.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>If the replica number is zero, then the peer MUST check that it
            is responsible for the resource and, if not, reject the request.
            If the replica number is nonzero, then the peer MUST check that it
            expects to be a replica for the resource and that the request
            sender is consistent with being the responsible node (i.e., that
            the receiving peer does not know of a better node) and, if not,
            reject the request.
</p>
<p>Each StoreKindData element represents the data to be stored for
            a single Kind-ID. The contents of the element are: </p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd>

                more stored_data values depending on the data model associated
                with each kind.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>The peer MUST perform the following checks:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The kind_id is known and supported.
</li>
<li>The signatures over each individual data element (if any)
                are valid. If this check fails, the request MUST be rejected
                with an Error_Forbidden error.
</li>
<li>Each element is signed by a credential which is authorized
                to write this kind at this Resource-ID. If this check fails,
                the request MUST be rejected with an Error_Forbidden
                error.
</li>
<li>For original (non-replica) stores, the peer MUST check that
                if the generation-counter is non-zero, it equals the current
                value of the generation-counter for this kind. This feature
                allows the generation counter to be used in a way similar to
                the HTTP Etag feature.
</li>
<li>For replica Stores, the peer MUST set the generation
                counter to match the generation_counter in the message, and
                MUST NOT check the generation counter against the current
                value. Replica Stores MUST NOT use a generation counter of
                0.
</li>
<li>The storage time values are greater than that of any value
                which would be replaced by this Store.
</li>
<li>The size and number of the stored values is consistent with
                the limits specified in the overlay configuration.
</li>
</ul>

<p>If all these checks succeed, the peer MUST attempt to store the
            data values. For non-replica stores, if the store succeeds and the
            data is changed, then the peer must increase the generation
            counter by at least one. If there are multiple stored values in a
            single StoreKindData, it is permissible for the peer to increase
            the generation counter by only 1 for the entire Kind-ID, or by 1
            or more than one for each value. Accordingly, all stored data
            values must have a generation counter of 1 or greater. 0 is used
            in the Store request to indicate that the generation counter
            should be ignored for processing this request; however the
            responsible peer should increase the stored generation counter and
            should return the correct generation counter in the response.
</p>
<p>When a peer stores data previously stored by another node
            (e.g., for replicas or topology shifts) it MUST adjust the
            lifetime value downward to reflect the amount of time the value
            was stored at the peer.
</p>
<p>Unless otherwise specified by the usage, if a peer attempts to
            store data previously stored by another node (e.g., for replicas
            or topology shifts) and that store fails with either an
            Error_Generation_Counter_Too_Low or an Error_Data_Too old error,
            the peer MUST fetch the newer data from the peer generating the
            error and use that to replace its own copy. This rule allows
            resynchronization after partitions heal.

Removing Values</h3>

<p>This version of RELOAD (unlike previous versions) does not have
            an explicit Remove operation. Rather, values are Removed by
            storing "nonexistent" values in their place. Each DataValue
            contains a boolean value called "exists" which indicates whether a
            value is present at that location. In order to effectively remove
            a value, the owner stores a new DataValue with:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>exists = false
</p>
<p>value = {} (0 length)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Storing nodes MUST treat these nonexistent values the same way
            they treat any other stored value, including overwriting the
            existing value, replicating them, and aging them out as necessary
            when lifetime expires. When a stored nonexistent value's lifetime
            expires, it is simply removed from the storing node like any other
            stored value expiration. Note that in the case of arrays and
            dictionaries, this may create an implicit, unsigned "nonexistent"
            value to represent a gap in the data structure. However, this
            value isn't persistent nor is it replicated. It is simply
            synthesized by the storing node.

<p>The model_specifier is as follows:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>If the data model is single value, the specifier is
                empty.
</li>
<li>If the data model is array, the specifier contains a list

                The first integer is the beginning of the range and the second
                is the end of the range. 0 is used to indicate the first
                element and 0xffffffff is used to indicate the final element.

</li>
<li>If the data model is dictionary then the specifier contains
                a list of the dictionary keys being requested. If no keys are
                specified, than this is a wildcard fetch and all key-value

<p>The generation-counter is used to indicate the requester's
            expected state of the storing peer. If the generation-counter in

            returns a response with no StoredData values.

<p>Note that because the certificate for a user is typically
            stored at the same location as any data stored for that user, a
            requesting node that does not already have the user's certificate
            should request the certificate in the Fetch as an
            optimization.

<p>There is one subtle point about signature computation on
            arrays. If the storing node uses the append feature (where the
            index=0xffffffff), then the index in the StoredData that is
            returned will not match that used by the storing node, which would
            break the signature. In order to avoid this issue, the index value
            in the array is set to zero before the signature is computed. This
            implies that malicious storing nodes can reorder array entries
            without being detected.

Defining New Kinds</h3>

<p>There are two ways to define a new kind. The first is by writing
          a document and registering the kind-id with IANA. This is the
          preferred method for kinds which may be widely used and reused. The
          second method is to simply define the kind and its parameters in the
          configuration document using the section of kind-id space set aside
          for private use. This method MAY be used to define ad hoc kinds in
          new overlays.
</p>
<p>However a kind is defined, the definition must include:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The meaning of the data to be stored (in some textual
              form).
</li>
<li>The Kind-ID.
</li>
<li>The data model (single value, array, dictionary, etc).
</li>
<li>The access control model.
</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, when kinds are registered with IANA, each kind is
          assigned a short string name which is used to refer to it in
          configuration documents.
</p>
<p>While each kind needs to define what data model is used for its
          data, that does not mean that it must define new data models. Where
          practical, kinds should use the existing data models. The intention
          is that the basic data model set be sufficient for most
          applications/usages.

Certificate Store Usage</h3>

<p>The Certificate Store usage allows a peer to store its certificate in
      the overlay, thus avoiding the need to send a certificate in each
      message - a reference may be sent instead.
</p>
<p>A user/peer MUST store its certificate at Resource-IDs derived from
      two Resource Names:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">

<p>Note that in the second case the certificate is not stored at the
      peer's Node-ID but rather at a hash of the peer's Node-ID. The intention
      here (as is common throughout RELOAD) is to avoid making a peer
      responsible for its own data.
</p>
<p>A peer MUST ensure that the user's certificates are stored in the
      Overlay Instance. New certificates are stored at the end of the list.
      This structure allows users to store an old and a new certificate that
      both have the same Node-ID, which allows for migration of certificates
      when they are renewed.

TURN Server Usage</h3>

<p>The TURN server usage allows a RELOAD peer to advertise that it is
      prepared to be a TURN server as defined in <a class='info' href='#RFC5766'>[RFC5766]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Mahy, R., Matthews, P., and J. Rosenberg, &ldquo;Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN): Relay Extensions to Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN),&rdquo; April&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>. When a node starts up, it joins the overlay
      network and forms several connections in the process. If the ICE stage
      in any of these connections returns a reflexive address that is not the
      same as the peer's perceived address, then the peer is behind a NAT and
      not a candidate for a TURN server. Additionally, if the peer's IP
      address is in the private address space range, then it is also not a
      candidate for a TURN server. Otherwise, the peer SHOULD assume it is a
      potential TURN server and follow the procedures below.
</p>
<p>If the node is a candidate for a TURN server it will insert some
      pointers in the overlay so that other peers can find it. The overlay
      configuration file specifies a turn-density parameter that indicates how
      many times each TURN server should record itself in the overlay.
      Typically this should be set to the reciprocal of the estimate of what
      percentage of peers will act as TURN servers. If the turn-density is not set to zero, for each value, called d,
      between 1 and turn-density, the peer forms a Resource Name by
      concatenating its Peer-ID and the value d. This Resource Name is hashed
      to form a Resource-ID. The address of the peer is stored at that
      Resource-ID using type TURN-SERVICE and the TurnServer object:
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
     struct {
       uint8                   iteration;
       IpAddressAndPort        server_address;
     } TurnServer;

<p></p>

<dt>Note:</dt>
<dd>Correct functioning of this algorithm depends
          critically on having turn-density be an accurate estimate of the
          true density of TURN servers. If turn-density is too high, then the
          process of finding TURN servers becomes extremely expensive as
          multiple candidate Resource-IDs must be probed.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>Peers that provide this service need to support the TURN extensions
      to STUN for media relay as defined in <a class='info' href='#RFC5766'>[RFC5766]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Mahy, R., Matthews, P., and J.

<dd>NODE-MULTIPLE, with maximum iteration

</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>Peers can find other servers by selecting a random Resource-ID and
      then doing a Find request for the appropriate server type with that
      Resource-ID. The Find request gets routed to a random peer based on the
      Resource-ID. If that peer knows of any servers, they will be returned.
      The returned response may be empty if the peer does not know of any
      servers, in which case the process gets repeated with some other random
      Resource-ID. As long as the ratio of servers relative to peers is not
      too low, this approach will result in finding a server relatively
      quickly.

Chord Algorithm </h3>

<p>This algorithm is assigned the name chord-reload to indicate it is an
      adaptation of the basic Chord DHT algorithm.
</p>
<p>This algorithm differs from the originally presented Chord algorithm
      <a class='info' href='#Chord'>[Chord]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Stoica, I., Morris, R., Liben-Nowell, D., Karger, D., Kaashoek, M., Dabek, F., and H. Balakrishnan, &ldquo;Chord: A Scalable Peer-to-peer Lookup Protocol for Internet           Applications,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>. It has been updated based on more recent
      research results and implementation experiences, and to adapt it to the
      RELOAD protocol. A short list of differences:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The original Chord algorithm specified that a single predecessor
          and a successor list be stored. The chord-reload algorithm attempts
          to have more than one predecessor and successor. The predecessor
          sets help other neighbors learn their successor list.
</li>
<li>The original Chord specification and analysis called for
          iterative routing. RELOAD specifies recursive routing. In addition
          to the performance implications, the cost of NAT traversal dictates
          recursive routing.
</li>
<li>Finger table entries are indexed in opposite order. Original
          Chord specifies finger[0] as the immediate successor of the peer.
          chord-reload specifies finger[0] as the peer 180 degrees around the
          ring from the peer. This change was made to simplify discussion and
          implementation of variable sized finger tables. However, with either
          approach no more than O(log N) entries should typically be stored in
          a finger table.
</li>
<li>The stabilize() and fix_fingers() algorithms in the original
          Chord algorithm are merged into a single periodic process.
          Stabilization is implemented slightly differently because of the
          larger neighborhood, and fix_fingers is not as aggressive to reduce
          load, nor does it search for optimal matches of the finger table
          entries.
</li>
<li>RELOAD uses a 128 bit hash instead of a 160 bit hash, as RELOAD
          is not designed to be used in networks with close to or more than
          2^128 nodes (and it is hard to see how one would assemble such a
          network).
</li>
<li>RELOAD uses randomized finger entries as described in <a class='info' href='#sec-finger-refresh'>Section&nbsp;9.6.4.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Refreshing finger table</span><span>)</span></a>.
</li>
<li>This algorithm allows the use of either reactive or periodic
          recovery. The original Chord paper used periodic recovery. Reactive
          recovery provides better performance in small overlays, but is
          believed to be unstable in large (&gt;1000) overlays with high
          levels of churn <a class='info' href='#handling-churn-usenix04'>[handling&#8209;churn&#8209;usenix04]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rhea, S., Geels, D., Roscoe, T., and J. Kubiatowicz, &ldquo;Handling Churn in a DHT,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>. The

<a name="rfc.section.9.1"></a><h3>9.1.&nbsp;
Overview</h3>

<p>The algorithm described here is a modified version of the Chord
        algorithm. Each peer keeps track of a finger table and a neighbor
        table. The neighbor table contains at least the three peers before and
        after this peer in the DHT ring. There may not be three entries in all
        cases such as small rings or while the ring topology is changing. The
        first entry in the finger table contains the peer half-way around the
        ring from this peer; the second entry contains the peer that is 1/4 of
        the way around; the third entry contains the peer that is 1/8th of the
        way around, and so on. Fundamentally, the chord data structure can be
        thought of a doubly-linked list formed by knowing the successors and
        predecessor peers in the neighbor table, sorted by the Node-ID. As
        long as the successor peers are correct, the DHT will return the
        correct result. The pointers to the prior peers are kept to enable the
        insertion of new peers into the list structure. Keeping multiple
        predecessor and successor pointers makes it possible to maintain the
        integrity of the data structure even when consecutive peers
        simultaneously fail. The finger table forms a skip list, so that
        entries in the linked list can be found in O(log(N)) time instead of
        the typical O(N) time that a linked list would provide.
</p>
<p>A peer, n, is responsible for a particular Resource-ID k if k is
        less than or equal to n and k is greater than p, where p is the peer
        id of the previous peer in the neighbor table. Care must be taken when
        computing to note that all math is modulo 2^128.

Routing</h3>

<p>The routing table is the union of the neighbor table and the finger
        table.
</p>
<p>If a peer is not responsible for a Resource-ID k, but is directly
        connected to a node with Node-ID k, then it routes the message to that
        node. Otherwise, it routes the request to the peer in the routing
        table that has the largest Node-ID that is in the interval between the
        peer and k. If no such node is found, it finds the smallest node id
        that is greater than k and routes the message to that node.

<a name="rfc.section.9.3"></a><h3>9.3.&nbsp;
Redundancy </h3>

<p>When a peer receives a Store request for Resource-ID k, and it is
        responsible for Resource-ID k, it stores the data and returns a
        success response. It then sends a Store request to its successor in
        the neighbor table and to that peer's successor. Note that these Store
        requests are addressed to those specific peers, even though the
        Resource-ID they are being asked to store is outside the range that
        they are responsible for. The peers receiving these check they came
        from an appropriate predecessor in their neighbor table and that they
        are in a range that this predecessor is responsible for, and then they
        store the data. They do not themselves perform further Stores because
        they can determine that they are not responsible for the
        Resource-ID.

<p>The sequential replicas used in this overlay algorithm protect
        against peer failure but not against malicious peers. Additional

Joining</h3>

<p>The join process for a joining party (JP) with Node-ID n is as
        follows.
</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>JP MUST connect to its chosen bootstrap node.
</li>
<li>JP SHOULD use a series of Pings to populate its routing
            table.
</li>
<li>JP SHOULD send Attach requests to initiate connections to each
            of the peers in the neighbor table as well as to the desired
            finger table entries. Note that this does not populate their
            routing tables, but only their connection tables, so JP will not
            get messages that it is expected to route to other nodes.
</li>
<li>JP MUST enter all the peers it has contacted into its routing
            table.
</li>
<li>JP SHOULD send a Join to its immediate successor, the admitting
            peer (AP) for Node-ID n. The AP sends the response to the
            Join.
</li>
<li>AP MUST do a series of Store requests to JP to store the data
            that JP will be responsible for.
</li>
<li>AP MUST send JP an Update explicitly labeling JP as its
            predecessor. At this point, JP is part of the ring and responsible
            for a section of the overlay. AP can now forget any data which is
            assigned to JP and not AP.
</li>
<li>The AP MUST send an Update to all of its neighbors with the new
            values of its neighbor set (including JP).
</li>
<li>The JP MUST send Updates to all the peers in its neighbor
            table.
</li>
</ol>

<p>In order to populate its neighbor table, JP sends a Ping via the
        bootstrap node directed at Resource-ID n+1 (directly after its own
        Resource-ID). This allows it to discover its own successor. Call that
        node p0. It then sends a ping to p0+1 to discover its successor (p1).
        This process can be repeated to discover as many successors as
        desired. The values for the two peers before p will be found at a
        later stage when n receives an Update.
</p>
<p>In order to set up its finger table entry for peer i, JP simply
        sends an Attach to peer (n+2^(128-i). This will be routed to a peer in
        approximately the right location around the ring.
</p>
<p>The joining peer MUST NOT send any Update message placing itself in
        the overlay until it has successfully completed an Attach with each
        peer that should be in its neighbor table.

Routing Attaches</h3>

<p>When a peer needs to Attach to a new peer in its neighbor table, it
        MUST source-route the Attach request through the peer from which it
        learned the new peer's Node-ID. Source-routing these requests allows
        the overlay to recover from instability.
</p>
<p>All other Attach requests, such as those for new finger table
        entries, are routed conventionally through the overlay.

Handling Neighbor Failures</h3>

<p>Every time a connection to a peer in the neighbor table is lost
          (as determined by connectivity pings or the failure of some
          request), the peer MUST remove the entry from its neighbor table and
          replace it with the best match it has from the other peers in its
          routing table. If using reactive recovery, it then sends an
          immediate Update to all nodes in its Neighbor Table. The update will
          contain all the Node-IDs of the current entries of the table (after
          the failed one has been removed). Note that when replacing a
          successor the peer SHOULD delay the creation of new replicas for
          successor replacement hold-down time (30 seconds) after removing the
          failed entry from its neighbor table in order to allow a triggered
          update to inform it of a better match for its neighbor table.
</p>
<p>If the neighbor failure effects the peer's range of responsible
          IDs, then the Update MUST be sent to all nodes in its Connection
          Table.
</p>
<p>A peer MAY attempt to reestablish connectivity with a lost
          neighbor either by waiting additional time to see if connectivity
          returns or by actively routing a new ATTACH to the lost peer.
          Details for these procedures are beyond the scope of this document.
          In no event does an attempt to reestablish connectivity with a lost
          neighbor allow the peer to remain in the neighbor table. Such a peer
          is returned to the neighbor table once connectivity is
          reestablished.
</p>
<p>If connectivity is lost to all successor peers in the neighbor
          table, then this peer should behave as if it is joining the network
          and use Pings to find a peer and send it a Join. If connectivity is
          lost to all the peers in the finger table, this peer should assume
          that it has been disconnected from the rest of the network, and it
          should periodically try to join the DHT.

Handling Finger Table Entry Failure</h3>

<p>If a finger table entry is found to have failed, all references
          to the failed peer are removed from the finger table and replaced
          with the closest preceding peer from the finger table or neighbor
          table.
</p>
<p>If using reactive recovery, the peer initiates a search for a new
          finger table entry as described below.

<a name="rfc.section.9.6.3"></a><h3>9.6.3.&nbsp;
Receiving Updates</h3>

<p>When a peer, N, receives an Update request, it examines the
          Node-IDs in the UpdateReq and at its neighbor table and decides if
          this UpdateReq would change its neighbor table. This is done by
          taking the set of peers currently in the neighbor table and
          comparing them to the peers in the update request. There are two
          major cases:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The UpdateReq contains peers that match N's neighbor table,
              so no change is needed to the neighbor set.
</li>
<li>The UpdateReq contains peers N does not know about that
              should be in N's neighbor table, i.e. they are closer than
              entries in the neighbor table.
</li>
</ul>

<p>In the first case, no change is needed.
</p>
<p>In the second case, N MUST attempt to Attach to the new peers and
          if it is successful it MUST adjust its neighbor set accordingly.
          Note that it can maintain the now inferior peers as neighbors, but
          it MUST remember the closer ones.
</p>
<p>After any Pings and Attaches are done, if the neighbor table
          changes and the peer is using reactive recovery, the peer sends an
          Update request to each member of its Connection Table. These Update
          requests are what end up filling in the predecessor/successor tables
          of peers that this peer is a neighbor to. A peer MUST NOT enter
          itself in its successor or predecessor table and instead should
          leave the entries empty.
</p>
<p>If peer N is responsible for a Resource-ID R, and N discovers
          that the replica set for R (the next two nodes in its successor set)
          has changed, it MUST send a Store for any data associated with R to
          any new node in the replica set. It SHOULD NOT delete data from
          peers which have left the replica set.
</p>
<p>When a peer N detects that it is no longer in the replica set for
          a resource R (i.e., there are three predecessors between N and R),
          it SHOULD delete all data associated with R from its local
          store.
</p>
<p>When a peer discovers that its range of responsible IDs have
          changed, it MUST send an UPDATE to all entries in its connection
          table.

Updating neighbor table</h3>

<p>A peer MUST periodically send an Update request to every peer
            in its Connection Table. The purpose of this is to keep the
            predecessor and successor lists up to date and to detect failed
            peers. The default time is about every ten minutes, but the
            enrollment server SHOULD set this in the configuration document
            using the "chord-reload-update-interval" element (denominated in
            seconds.) A peer SHOULD randomly offset these Update requests so
            they do not occur all at once.
</p>

<a name="rfc.section.9.6.4.2"></a><h3>9.6.4.2.&nbsp;
Refreshing finger table</h3>

<p>A peer MUST periodically search for new peers to replace
            invalid (repeated) entries in the finger table. A finger table
            entry i is valid if it is in the range [n+2^(128-i),
            n+2^(128-(i-1))-2^(128-(i+1))]. Invalid entries occur in the
            finger table when a previous finger table entry has failed or when
            no peer has been found in that range.
</p>
<p>A peer SHOULD NOT send Ping requests looking for new finger
            table entries more often than the configuration element
            "chord-reload-ping-interval", which defaults to 3600 seconds (one
            per hour).
</p>
<p>Two possible methods for searching for new peers for the finger
            table entries are presented:
</p>
<p>Alternative 1: A peer selects one entry in the finger table
            from among the invalid entries. It pings for a new peer for that
            finger table entry. The selection SHOULD be exponentially weighted
            to attempt to replace earlier (lower i) entries in the finger
            table. A simple way to implement this selection is to search
            through the finger table entries from i=0 and each time an invalid
            entry is encountered, send a Ping to replace that entry with
            probability 0.5.
</p>
<p>Alternative 2: A peer monitors the Update messages received
            from its connections to observe when an Update indicates a peer
            that would be used to replace in invalid finger table entry, i,
            and flags that entry in the finger table. Every
            "chord-reload-ping-interval" seconds, the peer selects from among
            those flagged candidates using an exponentially weighted
            probability as above.
</p>
<p>When searching for a better entry, the peer SHOULD send the
            Ping to a Node-ID selected randomly from that range. Random
            selection is preferred over a search for strictly spaced entries
            to minimize the effect of churn on overlay routing <a class='info' href='#minimizing-churn-sigcomm06'>[minimizing&#8209;churn&#8209;sigcomm06]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Godfrey, P., Shenker, S., and I. Stoica, &ldquo;Minimizing Churn in Distributed Systems,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>. An implementation or
            subsequent specification MAY choose a method for selecting finger
            table entries other than choosing randomly within the range. Any
            such alternate methods SHOULD be employed only on finger table
            stabilization and not for the selection of initial finger table
            entries unless the alternative method is faster and imposes less
            overhead on the overlay.
</p>
<p>A peer MAY choose to keep connections to multiple peers that
            can act for a given finger table entry.

<a name="rfc.section.9.6.4.3"></a><h3>9.6.4.3.&nbsp;
Adjusting finger table size</h3>

<p>If the finger table has less than 16 entries, the node SHOULD
            attempt to discover more fingers to grow the size of the table to
            16. The value 16 was chosen to ensure high odds of a node
            maintaining connectivity to the overlay even with strange network
            partitions.
</p>
<p>For many overlays, 16 finger table entries will be enough, but
            as an overlay grows very large, more than 16 entries may be
            required in the finger table for efficient routing. An
            implementation SHOULD be capable of increasing the number of
            entries in the finger table to 128 entries.
</p>
<p>Note to implementers: Although log(N) entries are all that are
            required for optimal performance, careful implementation of
            stabilization will result in no additional traffic being generated
            when maintaining a finger table larger than log(N) entries.
            Implementers are encouraged to make use of RouteQuery and
            algorithms for determining where new finger table entries may be
            found. Complete details of possible implementations are outside
            the scope of this specification.
</p>
<p>A simple approach to sizing the finger table is to ensure the
            finger table is large enough to contain at least the final
            successor in the peer's neighbor table.

Detecting partitioning</h3>

<p>To detect that a partitioning has occurred and to heal the
            overlay, a peer P MUST periodically repeat the discovery process
            used in the initial join for the overlay to locate an appropriate
            bootstrap node, B. P should then send a Ping for its own Node-ID
            routed through B. If a response is received from a peer S', which
            is not P's successor, then the overlay is partitioned and P should
            send an Attach to S' routed through B, followed by an Update sent
            to S'. (Note that S' may not be in P's neighbor table once the
            overlay is healed, but the connection will allow S' to discover
            appropriate neighbor entries for itself via its own
            stabilization.)
</p>
<p>Future specifications may describe alternative mechanisms for
            determining when to repeat the discovery process.

<dt>bootstrap-node </dt>
<dd>This element represents the address

<dt>turn-density </dt>
<dd>This element is a positive integer

<dt>clients-permitted </dt>
<dd>This element represents whether
            clients are permitted or whether all nodes must be peers. If it is
            set to "TRUE" or absent, this indicates that clients are
            permitted. If it is set to "FALSE" then nodes MUST join as

<dt>no-ice </dt>
<dd>This element represents whether nodes are

<dd>This contains a single Node-ID in

<dt>bad-node </dt>
<dd>This contains a single Node-ID in

            MUST NOT be considered valid. This allows certificate revocation.
            An arbitrary number of these elements can be provided. Note that
            because certificates may expire, bad-node entries need only be
            present for the lifetime of the certificate. Technically speaking,
            bad node-ids may be reused once their certificates have expired,
            the requirement for node-ids to be pseudo randomly generated gives
            this event a vanishing probability.

</dl></blockquote>

<p>Inside each overlay element, the required-kinds elements can also
        occur. This element indicates the kinds that members must support and
        contains multiple kind-block elements that each define a single kind
        that MUST be supported by nodes in the overlay. Each kind-block
        consists of a single kind element and a kind-signature. The kind
        element defines the kind. The kind-signature is the signature computed
        over the kind element.
</p>
<p>Each kind has either an ID attribute or a name attribute. The name
        attribute is a string representing the kind (the name registered to
        IANA) while the ID is an integer kind-id allocated out of private
        space.
</p>
<p>In addition, the kind element contains the following elements:
        </p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>max-count:</dt>
<dd>the maximum number of values which
            members of the overlay must support.
</dd>
<dt>data-model:</dt>
<dd>the data model to be used.
</dd>
<dt>max-size:</dt>
<dd>the maximum size of individual values.
</dd>
<dt>access-control:</dt>
<dd>the access control model to be
            used.
</dd>
<dt>max-node-multiple:</dt>
<dd>This is optional and only used
            when the access control is NODE-MULTIPLE. This indicates the
            maximum value for the i counter. This is an integer greater than
            0.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>All of the non optional values MUST be provided. If the kind is
        registered with IANA, the data-model and access-control attributes
        MUST match those in the kind registration. For instance, the example
        above indicates that members must support SIP-REGISTRATION with a
        maximum of 10 values of up to 1000 bytes each. Multiple required-kinds
        elements MAY be present.
</p>
<p>The kind-block element also MUST contain a "kind-signature"
        element. This signature is computed across the kind from the beginning
        of the first &lt; of the kind to the end of the last &gt; of the kind
        in the same way as the "signature element described later in this
        section.
</p>
<p>The configuration file is a binary file and cannot be changed -
        including whitespace changes - or the signature will break. The
        signature is computed by taking each configuration element and
        starting from, and including, the first &lt; at the start of
        &lt;configuration&gt; up to and including the &gt; in
        &lt;/configuration&gt; and treating this as a binary blob that is
        signed using the standard SecurityBlock defined in <a class='info' href='#sec-signature'>Section&nbsp;5.3.4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Security Block</span><span>)</span></a>. The SecurityBlock is base 64 encoded
        using the base64 alphabet from RFC<a class='info' href='#RFC4648'>[RFC4648]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Josefsson, S., &ldquo;The Base16, Base32, and Base64 Data Encodings,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> and
        put in the signature element following the configuration object in the
        config file.
</p>
<p>When a node receives a new configuration file, it MUST change its
        configuration to meet the new requirements. This may require the node
        to exit the DHT and re-join. If a node is not capable of supporting
        the new requirements, it MUST exit the overlay. If some information
        about a particular kind changes from what the node previously knew
        about the kind (for example the max size), the new information in the
        configuration files overrides any previously learned information. If
        any kind data was signed by a node that is no longer allowed to sign
        kinds, that kind MUST be discarded along with any stored information
        of that kind. Note that forcing an avalanche restart of the overlay
        with a configuration change that requires re-joining the overlay may
        result in serious performance problems, including total collapse of
        the network if configuration parameters are not properly considered.
        Such an event may be necessary in case of a compromised CA or similar
        problem, but for large overlays should be avoided in almost all
        circumstances.

Discovery Through Enrollment Server</h3>

<p>When a node first enrolls in a new overlay, it starts with a
        discovery process to find an enrollment server.
</p>
<p>The node first determines the overlay name. This value is provided
        by the user or some other out of band provisioning mechanism. The out
        of band mechanisms may also provide an optional URL for the enrollment
        server. If a URL for the enrollment server is not provided, the node
        MUST do a DNS SRV query using a Service name of "p2psip-enroll" and a
        protocol of TCP to find an enrollment server and form the URL by
        appending a path of "/.well-known/p2psip-enroll" to the overlay name.
        This uses the "well known URI" framework defined in <a class='info' href='#RFC5785'>[RFC5785]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Nottingham, M. and E. Hammer-Lahav, &ldquo;Defining Well-Known Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs),&rdquo; April&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>. For example, if the overlay name was
        example.com, the URL would be
        "https://example.com//.well-known/p2psip-enroll".
</p>
<p>Once an address and URL for the enrollment server is determined,
        the peer forms an HTTPS connection to that IP address. The certificate
        MUST match the overlay name as described in <a class='info' href='#RFC2818'>[RFC2818]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rescorla, E., &ldquo;HTTP Over TLS,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a>. Then the node MUST fetch a new copy of the
        configuration file. To do this, the peer performs a GET to the URL.
        The result of the HTTP GET is an XML configuration file described
        above, which replaces any previously learned configuration file for
        this overlay.
</p>
<p>For overlays that do not use an enrollment server, nodes obtain the
        configuration information needed to join the overlay through some out
        of band approach such an XML configuration file sent over email.

Credentials</h3>

<p>If the configuration document contains a enrollment-server element,
        credentials are required to join the Overlay Instance. A peer which
        does not yet have credentials MUST contact the enrollment server to
        acquire them.
</p>
<p>RELOAD defines its own trivial certificate request protocol. We
        would have liked to have used an existing protocol but were concerned
        about the implementation burden of even the simplest of those
        protocols, such as <a class='info' href='#RFC5272'>[RFC5272]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schaad, J. and M. Myers, &ldquo;Certificate Management over CMS (CMC),&rdquo; June&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> and <a class='info' href='#RFC5273'>[RFC5273]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schaad, J. and M. Myers, &ldquo;Certificate Management over CMS (CMC): Transport Protocols,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>. Our objective was to have a protocol which
        could be easily implemented in a Web server which the operator did not
        control (e.g., in a hosted service) and was compatible with the
        existing certificate handling tooling as used with the Web certificate
        infrastructure. This means accepting bare PKCS#10 requests and
        returning a single bare X.509 certificate. Although the MIME types for
        these objects are defined, none of the existing protocols support
        exactly this model.
</p>
<p>The certificate request protocol is performed over HTTPS. The
        request is an HTTP POST with the following properties:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>If authentication is required, there is a URL parameter of
            "password" and "username" containing the user's name and password
            in the clear (hence the need for HTTPS)
</li>
<li>The body is of content type "application/pkcs10", as defined in
            <a class='info' href='#RFC2311'>[RFC2311]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Dusse, S., Hoffman, P., Ramsdell, B., Lundblade, L., and L. Repka, &ldquo;S/MIME Version 2 Message Specification,&rdquo; March&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</li>
<li>The Accept header contains the type "application/pkix-cert",
            indicating the type that is expected in the response.
</li>
</ul>

<p>The enrollment server MUST authenticate the request using the
        provided user name and password. If the authentication succeeds and
        the requested user name is acceptable, the server generates and
        returns a certificate. The SubjectAltName field in the certificate
        contains the following values:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>One or more Node-IDs which MUST be cryptographically random
            <a class='info' href='#RFC4086'>[RFC4086]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Eastlake, D., Schiller, J., and S. Crocker, &ldquo;Randomness Requirements for Security,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>. Each MUST be chosen by the
            enrollment server in such a way that they are unpredictable to the
            requesting user. E.g., the user MUST NOT be informed of potential
            (random) Node-IDs prior to authenticating. Each is placed in the
            subjectAltName using the uniformResourceIdentifier type and MUST
            contain RELOAD URIs as described in <a class='info' href='#sec-reload-uri'>Section&nbsp;13.15<span> (</span><span class='info'>reload URI Scheme</span><span>)</span></a> and MUST contain a Destination
            list with a single entry of type "node_id".
</li>
<li>A single name this user is allowed to use in the overlay, using
            type rfc822Name.
</li>
</ul>

<p>The certificate is returned as type "application/pkix-cert", with
        an HTTP status code of 200 OK. Certificate processing errors should be
        treated as HTTP errors and have appropriate HTTP status codes.
</p>
<p>The client MUST check that the certificate returned was signed by
        one of the certificates received in the "root-cert" list of the
        overlay configuration data. The node then reads the certificate to
        find the Node-IDs it can use.

Self-Generated Credentials</h3>

<p>If the "self-signed-permitted" element is present in the
          configuration and set to "TRUE", then a node MUST generate its own
          self-signed certificate to join the overlay. The self-signed
          certificate MAY contain any user name of the users choice.
</p>
<p>The Node-ID MUST be computed by applying the digest specified in
          the self-signed-permitted element to the DER representation of the
          user's public key (more specifically the subjectPublicKeyInfo) and
          taking the high order bits. When accepting a self-signed
          certificate, nodes MUST check that the Node-ID and public keys
          match. This prevents Node-ID theft.
</p>
<p>Once the node has constructed a self-signed certificate, it MAY
          join the overlay. Before storing its certificate in the overlay
          (<a class='info' href='#sec-store-usage'>Section&nbsp;7<span> (</span><span class='info'>Certificate Store Usage</span><span>)</span></a>) it SHOULD look to see if
          the user name is already taken and if so choose another user name.
          Note that this only provides protection against accidental name
          collisions. Name theft is still possible. If protection against name
          theft is desired, then the enrollment service must be used.

Searching for a Bootstrap Node</h3>

<p>If no cached bootstrap nodes are available and the config file has
        an multicast-bootstrap element, then the node SHOULD send a Ping
        request over UDP to the address and port found to each
        multicast-bootstrap element found in the configuration document. This
        MAY be a multicast, broadcast, or anycast address. The Ping should use
        the wildcard Node-ID as the destination Node-ID.
</p>
<p>The responder node that receives the Ping request SHOULD check that

Contacting a Bootstrap Node</h3>

<p>In order to join the overlay, the joining node MUST contact a node
        in the overlay. Typically this means contacting the bootstrap nodes,
        since they are reachable by the local peer or have public IP
        addresses. If the joining node has cached a list of peers it has
        previously been connected with in this overlay, as an optimization it
        MAY attempt to use one or more of them as bootstrap nodes before
        falling back to the bootstrap nodes listed in the configuration
        file.
</p>
<p>When contacting a bootstrap node, the joining node first forms the
        DTLS or TLS connection to the bootstrap node and then sends an Attach
        request over this connection with the destination Node-ID set to the
        joining node's Node-ID.
</p>
<p>When the requester node finally does receive a response from some
        responding node, it can note the Node-ID in the response and use this
        Node-ID to start sending requests to join the Overlay Instance as
        described in <a class='info' href='#sec-overlay-topology'>Section&nbsp;5.4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Overlay Topology</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>After a node has successfully joined the overlay network, it will
        have direct connections to several peers. Some MAY be added to the
        cached bootstrap nodes list and used in future boots. Peers that are
        not directly connected MUST NOT be cached. The suggested number of
        peers to cache is 10. Algorithms for determining which peers to cache
        are beyond the scope of this specification.

Message Flow Example</h3>

<p>The following abbreviation are used in the message flow diagrams: JP
      = joining peer, AP = admitting peer, NP = next peer after the AP, NNP =
      next next peer which is the peer after NP, PP = previous peer before the
      AP, PPP = previous previous peer which is the peer before the PP, BP =
      bootstrap peer.
</p>
<p>The following abbreviation are used in the message flow diagrams:
</p>
<p>In the following example, we assume that JP has formed a connection
      to one of the bootstrap nodes. JP then sends an Attach through that peer
      to the admitting peer (AP) to initiate a connection. When AP responds,
      JP and AP use ICE to set up a connection and then set up TLS.

<p>Once JP has connected to AP, it needs to populate its Routing Table.
      In Chord, this means that it needs to populate its neighbor table and
      its finger table. To populate its neighbor table, it needs the successor
      of AP, NP. It sends an Attach to the Resource-IP AP+1, which gets routed
      to NP. When NP responds, JP and NP use ICE and TLS to set up a
      connection.

<p>Once JP has a reasonable set of connections it is ready to take its
      place in the DHT. It does this by sending a Join to AP. AP does a series
      of Store requests to JP to store the data that JP will be responsible
      for. AP then sends JP an Update explicitly labeling JP as its
      predecessor. At this point, JP is part of the ring and responsible for a
      section of the overlay. AP can now forget any data which is assigned to
      JP and not AP.

      addresses. However, now that it has received an Update from AP, it has
      AP's predecessors, which are also its own, so it sends Attaches to them.

Overview</h3>

<p>RELOAD provides a generic storage service, albeit one designed to
        be useful for P2PSIP. In this section we discuss security issues that
        are likely to be relevant to any usage of RELOAD. More background
        information can be found in <a class='info' href='#RFC5765'>[RFC5765]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schulzrinne, H., Marocco, E., and E. Ivov, &ldquo;Security Issues and Solutions in Peer-to-Peer Systems for Realtime Communications,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>In any Overlay Instance, any given user depends on a number of
        peers with which they have no well-defined relationship except that
        they are fellow members of the Overlay Instance. In practice, these
        other nodes may be friendly, lazy, curious, or outright malicious. No
        security system can provide complete protection in an environment
        where most nodes are malicious. The goal of security in RELOAD is to
        provide strong security guarantees of some properties even in the face
        of a large number of malicious nodes and to allow the overlay to
        function correctly in the face of a modest number of malicious
        nodes.
</p>
<p>P2PSIP deployments require the ability to authenticate both peers
        and resources (users) without the active presence of a trusted entity
        in the system. We describe two mechanisms. The first mechanism is
        based on public key certificates and is suitable for general
        deployments. The second is an admission control mechanism based on an
        overlay-wide shared symmetric key.

<a name="rfc.section.12.2"></a><h3>12.2.&nbsp;
Attacks on P2P Overlays</h3>

<p>The two basic functions provided by overlay nodes are storage and
        routing: some node is responsible for storing a peer's data and for
        allowing a third peer to fetch this stored data. Other nodes are
        responsible for routing messages to and from the storing nodes. Each
        of these issues is covered in the following sections.
</p>
<p>P2P overlays are subject to attacks by subversive nodes that may
        attempt to disrupt routing, corrupt or remove user registrations, or
        eavesdrop on signaling. The certificate-based security algorithms we
        describe in this specification are intended to protect overlay routing
        and user registration information in RELOAD messages.
</p>
<p>To protect the signaling from attackers pretending to be valid
        peers (or peers other than themselves), the first requirement is to
        ensure that all messages are received from authorized members of the
        overlay. For this reason, RELOAD transports all messages over a secure
        channel (TLS and DTLS are defined in this document) which provides
        message integrity and authentication of the directly communicating
        peer. In addition, messages and data are digitally signed with the
        sender's private key, providing end-to-end security for
        communications.

<a name="rfc.section.12.3"></a><h3>12.3.&nbsp;
Certificate-based Security</h3>

<p>This specification stores users' registrations and possibly other
        data in an overlay network. This requires a solution to securing this
        data as well as securing, as well as possible, the routing in the
        overlay. Both types of security are based on requiring that every
        entity in the system (whether user or peer) authenticate
        cryptographically using an asymmetric key pair tied to a
        certificate.
</p>
<p>When a user enrolls in the Overlay Instance, they request or are
        assigned a unique name, such as "alice@dht.example.net". These names
        are unique and are meant to be chosen and used by humans much like a
        SIP Address of Record (AOR) or an email address. The user is also
        assigned one or more Node-IDs by the central enrollment authority.
        Both the name and the Node-ID are placed in the certificate, along
        with the user's public key.
</p>
<p>Each certificate enables an entity to act in two sorts of
        roles:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>As a user, storing data at specific Resource-IDs in the Overlay
            Instance corresponding to the user name.
</li>
<li>As a overlay peer with the Peer-ID(s) listed in the
            certificate.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that since only users of this Overlay Instance need to
        validate a certificate, this usage does not require a global PKI.
        Instead, certificates are signed by a central enrollment authority
        which acts as the certificate authority for the Overlay Instance. This
        authority signs each peer's certificate. Because each peer possesses
        the CA's certificate (which they receive on enrollment) they can
        verify the certificates of the other entities in the overlay without
        further communication. Because the certificates contain the
        user/peer's public key, communications from the user/peer can be
        verified in turn.
</p>
<p>If self-signed certificates are used, then the security provided is
        significantly decreased, since attackers can mount Sybil attacks. In
        addition, attackers cannot trust the user names in certificates
        (though they can trust the Node-IDs because they are cryptographically
        verifiable). This scheme may be appropriate for some small
        deployments, such as a small office or an ad hoc overlay set up among
        participants in a meeting where all hosts on the network are trusted.
        Some additional security can be provided by using the shared secret
        admission control scheme as well.
</p>
<p>Because all stored data is signed by the owner of the data the
        storing peer can verify that the storer is authorized to perform a
        store at that Resource-ID and also allow any consumer of the data to
        verify the provenance and integrity of the data when it retrieves
        it.
</p>
<p>Note that RELOAD does not itself provide a revocation/status
        mechanism (though certificates may of course include OCSP responder
        information). Thus, certificate lifetimes should be chosen to balance
        the compromise window versus the cost of certificate renewal. Because
        RELOAD is already designed to operate in the face of some fraction of
        malicious peers, this form of compromise is not fatal.
</p>
<p>All implementations MUST implement certificate-based security.

<a name="rfc.section.12.4"></a><h3>12.4.&nbsp;
Shared-Secret Security</h3>

<p>RELOAD also supports a shared secret admission control scheme that
        relies on a single key that is shared among all members of the
        overlay. It is appropriate for small groups that wish to form a
        private network without complexity. In shared secret mode, all the
        peers share a single symmetric key which is used to key TLS-PSK <a class='info' href='#RFC4279'>[RFC4279]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Eronen, P. and H. Tschofenig, &ldquo;Pre-Shared Key Ciphersuites for Transport Layer Security (TLS),&rdquo; December&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> or TLS-SRP <a class='info' href='#RFC5054'>[RFC5054]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Taylor, D., Wu, T., Mavrogiannopoulos, N., and T. Perrin, &ldquo;Using the Secure Remote Password (SRP) Protocol for TLS Authentication,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>
        mode. A peer which does not know the key cannot form TLS connections
        with any other peer and therefore cannot join the overlay.
</p>
<p>One natural approach to a shared-secret scheme is to use a
        user-entered password as the key. The difficulty with this is that in
        TLS-PSK mode, such keys are very susceptible to dictionary attacks. If
        passwords are used as the source of shared-keys, then TLS-SRP is a
        superior choice because it is not subject to dictionary attacks.

Storage Security</h3>

<p>When certificate-based security is used in RELOAD, any given
        Resource-ID/Kind-ID pair is bound to some small set of certificates.
        In order to write data, the writer must prove possession of the
        private key for one of those certificates. Moreover, all data is
        stored, signed with the same private key that was used to authorize
        the storage. This set of rules makes questions of authorization and
        data integrity - which have historically been thorny for overlays -
        relatively simple.
</p>
<a name="anchor105"></a><br /><hr />
<table summary="layout" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="2" class="TOCbug" align="right"><tr><td class="TOCbug"><a href="#toc">&nbsp;TOC&nbsp;</a></td></tr></table>
<a name="rfc.section.12.5.1"></a><h3>12.5.1.&nbsp;
Authorization</h3>

<p>When a client wants to store some value, it first digitally signs
          the value with its own private key. It then sends a Store request
          that contains both the value and the signature towards the storing
          peer (which is defined by the Resource Name construction algorithm
          for that particular kind of value).
</p>
<p>When the storing peer receives the request, it must determine
          whether the storing client is authorized to store at this
          Resource-ID/Kind-ID pair. Determining this requires comparing the
          user's identity to the requirements of the access control model (see
          <a class='info' href='#sec.access_control'>Section&nbsp;6.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Access Control Policies</span><span>)</span></a>). If it satisfies those
          requirements the user is authorized to write, pending quota checks
          as described in the next section.
</p>
<p>For example, consider the certificate with the following
          properties:
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
       User name: alice@dht.example.com
       Node-ID:   013456789abcdef
       Serial:    1234
</pre></div>
<p>If Alice wishes to Store a value of the "SIP Location" kind, the
          Resource Name will be the SIP AOR "sip:alice@dht.example.com". The
          Resource-ID will be determined by hashing the Resource Name. Because
          SIP Location uses the USER-NODE-MATCH policy, it first verifies that
          the user name in the certificate hashes to the requested
          Resource-ID. It then verifies that the node-id in the certificate
          matches the dictionary key being used for the store. If both of
          these checks succeed, the Store is authorized. Note that because the
          access control model is different for different kinds, the exact set
          of checks will vary.

<a name="rfc.section.12.5.2"></a><h3>12.5.2.&nbsp;
Distributed Quota</h3>

<p>Being a peer in an Overlay Instance carries with it the
          responsibility to store data for a given region of the Overlay
          Instance. However, allowing clients to store unlimited amounts of
          data would create unacceptable burdens on peers and would also
          enable trivial denial of service attacks. RELOAD addresses this
          issue by requiring configurations to define maximum sizes for each
          kind of stored data. Attempts to store values exceeding this size
          MUST be rejected (if peers are inconsistent about this, then strange
          artifacts will happen when the zone of responsibility shifts and a
          different peer becomes responsible for overlarge data). Because each
          Resource-ID/Kind-ID pair is bound to a small set of certificates,
          these size restrictions also create a distributed quota mechanism,
          with the quotas administered by the central enrollment server.
</p>
<p>Allowing different kinds of data to have different size
          restrictions allows new usages the flexibility to define limits that
          fit their needs without requiring all usages to have expansive
          limits.

<a name="rfc.section.12.5.3"></a><h3>12.5.3.&nbsp;
Correctness</h3>

<p>Because each stored value is signed, it is trivial for any
          retrieving peer to verify the integrity of the stored value. Some
          more care needs to be taken to prevent version rollback attacks.
          Rollback attacks on storage are prevented by the use of store times
          and lifetime values in each store. A lifetime represents the latest
          time at which the data is valid and thus limits (though does not
          completely prevent) the ability of the storing node to perform a
          rollback attack on retrievers. In order to prevent a rollback attack
          at the time of the Store request, we require that storage times be
          monotonically increasing. Storing peers MUST reject Store requests

          storing. In addition, a fetching node which receives a data value
          with a storage time older than the result of the previous fetch
          knows a rollback has occurred.

Residual Attacks</h3>

<p>The mechanisms described here provides a high degree of security,
          but some attacks remain possible. Most simply, it is possible for
          storing nodes to refuse to store a value (i.e., reject any request).
          In addition, a storing node can deny knowledge of values which it
          has previously accepted. To some extent these attacks can be
          ameliorated by attempting to store to/retrieve from replicas, but a
          retrieving client does not know whether it should try this or not,
          since there is a cost to doing so.
</p>
<p>The certificate-based authentication scheme prevents a single
          peer from being able to forge data owned by other peers.
          Furthermore, although a subversive peer can refuse to return data
          resources for which it is responsible, it cannot return forged data
          because it cannot provide authentication for such registrations.
          Therefore parallel searches for redundant registrations can mitigate
          most of the effects of a compromised peer. The ultimate reliability
          of such an overlay is a statistical question based on the
          replication factor and the percentage of compromised peers.
</p>
<p>In addition, when a kind is multivalued (e.g., an array data
          model), the storing node can return only some subset of the values,
          thus biasing its responses. This can be countered by using single
          values rather than sets, but that makes coordination between
          multiple storing agents much more difficult. This is a trade off
          that must be made when designing any usage.

Routing Security</h3>

<p>Because the storage security system guarantees (within limits) the
        integrity of the stored data, routing security focuses on stopping the
        attacker from performing a DOS attack that misroutes requests in the
        overlay. There are a few obvious observations to make about this.
        First, it is easy to ensure that an attacker is at least a valid peer
        in the Overlay Instance. Second, this is a DOS attack only. Third, if
        a large percentage of the peers on the Overlay Instance are controlled
        by the attacker, it is probably impossible to perfectly secure against
        this.

Background</h3>

<p>In general, attacks on DHT routing are mounted by the attacker
          arranging to route traffic through one or two nodes it controls. In
          the Eclipse attack <a class='info' href='#Eclipse'>[Eclipse]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Singh, A., Ngan, T., Druschel, T., and D. Wallach, &ldquo;Eclipse Attacks on Overlay Networks: Threats and           Defenses,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> the attacker
          tampers with messages to and from nodes for which it is on-path with
          respect to a given victim node. This allows it to pretend to be all
          the nodes that are reachable through it. In the Sybil attack <a class='info' href='#Sybil'>[Sybil]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Douceur, J., &ldquo;The Sybil Attack,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>, the attacker registers a large number of
          nodes and is therefore able to capture a large amount of the traffic
          through the DHT.
</p>
<p>Both the Eclipse and Sybil attacks require the attacker to be
          able to exercise control over her Peer-IDs. The Sybil attack
          requires the creation of a large number of peers. The Eclipse attack
          requires that the attacker be able to impersonate specific peers. In
          both cases, these attacks are limited by the use of centralized,
          certificate-based admission control.
</p>

<a name="rfc.section.12.6.2"></a><h3>12.6.2.&nbsp;
Admissions Control</h3>

<p>Admission to a RELOAD Overlay Instance is controlled by requiring
          that each peer have a certificate containing its Peer-ID. The
          requirement to have a certificate is enforced by using
          certificate-based mutual authentication on each connection. (Note:
          the following only applies when self-signed certificates are not
          used.) Whenever a peer connects to another peer, each side
          automatically checks that the other has a suitable certificate.
          These Peer-IDs are randomly assigned by the central enrollment
          server. This has two benefits:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>It allows the enrollment server to limit the number of peer
              IDs issued to any individual user.
</li>
<li>It prevents the attacker from choosing specific Peer-IDs.
</li>
</ul>

<p>The first property allows protection against Sybil attacks
          (provided the enrollment server uses strict rate limiting policies).
          The second property deters but does not completely prevent Eclipse
          attacks. Because an Eclipse attacker must impersonate peers on the
          other side of the attacker, he must have a certificate for suitable
          Peer-IDs, which requires him to repeatedly query the enrollment
          server for new certificates, which will match only by chance. From
          the attacker's perspective, the difficulty is that if he only has a
          small number of certificates, the region of the Overlay Instance he
          is impersonating appears to be very sparsely populated by comparison
          to the victim's local region.

<a name="rfc.section.12.6.3"></a><h3>12.6.3.&nbsp;
Peer Identification and Authentication</h3>

<p>In general, whenever a peer engages in overlay activity that
          might affect the routing table it must establish its identity. This
          happens in two ways. First, whenever a peer establishes a direct
          connection to another peer it authenticates via certificate-based
          mutual authentication. All messages between peers are sent over this
          protected channel and therefore the peers can verify the data origin
          of the last hop peer for requests and responses without further
          cryptography.
</p>
<p>In some situations, however, it is desirable to be able to
          establish the identity of a peer with whom one is not directly
          connected. The most natural case is when a peer Updates its state.
          At this point, other peers may need to update their view of the
          overlay structure, but they need to verify that the Update message
          came from the actual peer rather than from an attacker. To prevent
          this, all overlay routing messages are signed by the peer that
          generated them.
</p>
<p>Replay is typically prevented for messages that impact the
          topology of the overlay by having the information come directly, or
          be verified by, the nodes that claimed to have generated the update.
          Data storage replay detection is done by signing time of the node
          that generated the signature on the store request thus providing a
          time based replay protection but the time synchronization is only
          needed between peers that can write to the same location.

<a name="rfc.section.12.6.4"></a><h3>12.6.4.&nbsp;
Protecting the Signaling</h3>

<p>The goal here is to stop an attacker from knowing who is
          signaling what to whom. An attacker is unlikely to be able to
          observe the activities of a specific individual given the
          randomization of IDs and routing based on the present peers
          discussed above. Furthermore, because messages can be routed using
          only the header information, the actual body of the RELOAD message
          can be encrypted during transmission.
</p>
<p>There are two lines of defense here. The first is the use of TLS
          or DTLS for each communications link between peers. This provides
          protection against attackers who are not members of the overlay. The
          second line of defense is to digitally sign each message. This
          prevents adversarial peers from modifying messages in flight, even
          if they are on the routing path.

Residual Attacks</h3>

<p>The routing security mechanisms in RELOAD are designed to contain
          rather than eliminate attacks on routing. It is still possible for
          an attacker to mount a variety of attacks. In particular, if an
          attacker is able to take up a position on the overlay routing
          between A and B it can make it appear as if B does not exist or is
          disconnected. It can also advertise false network metrics in an
          attempt to reroute traffic. However, these are primarily DOS
          attacks.
</p>
<p>The certificate-based security scheme secures the namespace, but
          if an individual peer is compromised or if an attacker obtains a
          certificate from the CA, then a number of subversive peers can still
          appear in the overlay. While these peers cannot falsify responses to
          resource queries, they can respond with error messages, effecting a
          DoS attack on the resource registration. They can also subvert
          routing to other compromised peers. To defend against such attacks,
          a resource search must still consist of parallel searches for
          replicated registrations.

reload URI Scheme</h3>

<p>This section describes the scheme for a reload URI, which can be

</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>A peer.
</li>
<li>A resource inside a peer.
</li>
</ul>

<p>The reload URI is defined using a subset of the URI schema
        specified in Appendix A of RFC 3986 <a class='info' href='#RFC3986'>[RFC3986]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Berners-Lee, T., Fielding, R., and L. Masinter, &ldquo;Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> and
        the associated URI Guidelines <a class='info' href='#RFC4395'>[RFC4395]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Hansen, T., Hardie, T., and L. Masinter, &ldquo;Guidelines and Registration Procedures for New URI Schemes,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> per the
        following ABNF syntax:
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
   RELOAD-URI = "reload://" destination "@" overlay "/"
            [specifier]

         destination = 1 * HEXDIG
   overlay = reg-name
   specifier = 1*HEXDIG

</pre></div>
<p>The definitions of these productions are as follows:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>destination: </dt>
<dd>a hex-encoded Destination List
            object.
</dd>
<dt></dt>

<dd>
</dd>
<dt>specifier :</dt>
<dd>a hex-encoded StoredDataSpecifier
            indicating the data element.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>If no specifier is present then this URI addresses the peer which
        can be reached via the indicated destination list at the indicated
        overlay name. If a specifier is present, then the URI addresses the
        data value.

Routing Alternatives</h3>

<p>Significant discussion has been focused on the selection of a routing
      algorithm for P2PSIP. This section discusses the motivations for
      selecting symmetric recursive routing for RELOAD and describes the
      extensions that would be required to support additional routing
      algorithms.

<a name="rfc.section.A.1"></a><h3>A.1.&nbsp;
Iterative vs Recursive</h3>

<p>Iterative routing has a number of advantages. It is easier to
        debug, consumes fewer resources on intermediate peers, and allows the
        querying peer to identify and route around misbehaving peers <a class='info' href='#non-transitive-dhts-worlds05'>[non&#8209;transitive&#8209;dhts&#8209;worlds05]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Freedman, M., Lakshminarayanan, K., Rhea, S., and I. Stoica, &ldquo;Non-Transitive Connectivity and DHTs,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>. However, in the
        presence of NATs, iterative routing is intolerably expensive because a
        new connection must be established for each hop (using ICE) <a class='info' href='#bryan-design-hotp2p08'>[bryan&#8209;design&#8209;hotp2p08]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bryan, D., Lowekamp, B., and M. Zangrilli, &ldquo;The Design of a Versatile, Secure P2PSIP Communications           Architecture for the Public Internet,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>Iterative routing is supported through the Route_Query mechanism
        and is primarily intended for debugging. It also allows the querying
        peer to evaluate the routing decisions made by the peers at each hop,
        consider alternatives, and perhaps detect at what point the forwarding
        path fails.

<a name="rfc.section.A.2"></a><h3>A.2.&nbsp;
Symmetric vs Forward response</h3>

<p>An alternative to the symmetric recursive routing method used by
        RELOAD is Forward-Only routing, where the response is routed to the
        requester as if it were a new message initiated by the responder (in
        the previous example, Z sends the response to A as if it were sending
        a request). Forward-only routing requires no state in either the
        message or intermediate peers.
</p>
<p>The drawback of forward-only routing is that it does not work when
        the overlay is unstable. For example, if A is in the process of
        joining the overlay and is sending a Join request to Z, it is not yet
        reachable via forward routing. Even if it is established in the
        overlay, if network failures produce temporary instability, A may not
        be reachable (and may be trying to stabilize its network connectivity
        via Attach messages).
</p>
<p>Furthermore, forward-only responses are less likely to reach the
        querying peer than symmetric recursive ones are, because the forward
        path is more likely to have a failed peer than is the request path
        (which was just tested to route the request) <a class='info' href='#non-transitive-dhts-worlds05'>[non&#8209;transitive&#8209;dhts&#8209;worlds05]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Freedman, M., Lakshminarayanan, K., Rhea, S., and I. Stoica, &ldquo;Non-Transitive Connectivity and DHTs,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>An extension to RELOAD that supports forward-only routing but
        relies on symmetric responses as a fallback would be possible, but due
        to the complexities of determining when to use forward-only and when
        to fallback to symmetric, we have chosen not to include it as an
        option at this point.

<a name="rfc.section.A.3"></a><h3>A.3.&nbsp;
Direct Response</h3>

<p>Another routing option is Direct Response routing, in which the
        response is returned directly to the querying node. In the previous
        example, if A encodes its IP address in the request, then Z can simply
        deliver the response directly to A. In the absence of NATs or other
        connectivity issues, this is the optimal routing technique.
</p>
<p>The challenge of implementing direct response is the presence of
        NATs. There are a number of complexities that must be addressed. In
        this discussion, we will continue our assumption that A issued the
        request and Z is generating the response.
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The IP address listed by A may be unreachable, either due to
            NAT or firewall rules. Therefore, a direct response technique must
            fallback to symmetric response <a class='info' href='#non-transitive-dhts-worlds05'>[non&#8209;transitive&#8209;dhts&#8209;worlds05]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Freedman, M., Lakshminarayanan, K., Rhea, S., and I. Stoica, &ldquo;Non-Transitive Connectivity and DHTs,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>. The hop-by-hop ACKs
            used by RELOAD allow Z to determine when A has received the
            message (and the TLS negotiation will provide earlier confirmation
            that A is reachable), but this fallback requires a timeout that
            will increase the response latency whenever A is not reachable
            from Z.
</li>
<li>Whenever A is behind a NAT it will have multiple candidate IP
            addresses, each of which must be advertised to ensure
            connectivity; therefore Z will need to attempt multiple
            connections to deliver the response.
</li>
<li>One (or all) of A's candidate addresses may route from Z to a
            different device on the Internet. In the worst case these nodes
            may actually be running RELOAD on the same port. Therefore, it is
            absolutely necessary to establish a secure connection to
            authenticate A before delivering the response. This step
            diminishes the efficiency of direct response because multiple
            roundtrips are required before the message can be delivered.
</li>
<li>If A is behind a NAT and does not have a connection already
            established with Z, there are only two ways the direct response
            will work. The first is that A and Z both be behind the same NAT,
            in which case the NAT is not involved. In the more common case,
            when Z is outside A's NAT, the response will only be received if
            A's NAT implements endpoint-independent filtering. As the choice
            of filtering mode conflates application transparency with security
            <a class='info' href='#RFC4787'>[RFC4787]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Audet, F. and C. Jennings, &ldquo;Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>, and no clear recommendation is
            available, the prevalence of this feature in future devices
            remains unclear.
</li>
</ul>

<p>An extension to RELOAD that supports direct response routing but
        relies on symmetric responses as a fallback would be possible, but due
        to the complexities of determining when to use direct response and
        when to fallback to symmetric, and the reduced performance for
        responses to peers behind restrictive NATs, we have chosen not to
        include it as an option at this point.

Relay Peers</h3>

<p><a class='info' href='#I-D.jiang-p2psip-sep'>SEP<span> (</span><span class='info'>Jiang, X. and H. Zhang, &ldquo;Service Extensible P2P Peer Protocol,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> [I&#8209;D.jiang&#8209;p2psip&#8209;sep] has proposed
        implementing a form of direct response by having A identify a peer, Q,
        that will be directly reachable by any other peer. A uses Attach to
        establish a connection with Q and advertises Q's IP address in the
        request sent to Z. Z sends the response to Q, which relays it to A.
        This then reduces the latency to two hops, plus Z negotiating a secure
        connection to Q.
</p>
<p>This technique relies on the relative population of nodes such as A
        that require relay peers and peers such as Q that are capable of
        serving as a relay peer. It also requires nodes to be able to identify
        which category they are in. This identification problem has turned out
        to be hard to solve and is still an open area of exploration.
</p>
<p>An extension to RELOAD that supports relay peers is possible, but
        due to the complexities of implementing such an alternative, we have
        not added such a feature to RELOAD at this point.
</p>
<p>A concept similar to relay peers, essentially choosing a relay peer
        at random, has previously been suggested to solve problems of pairwise
        non-transitivity <a class='info' href='#non-transitive-dhts-worlds05'>[non&#8209;transitive&#8209;dhts&#8209;worlds05]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Freedman, M., Lakshminarayanan, K., Rhea, S., and I. Stoica, &ldquo;Non-Transitive Connectivity and DHTs,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>,
        but deterministic filtering provided by NATs makes random relay peers
        no more likely to work than the responding peer.

Symmetric Route Stability</h3>

<p>A common concern about symmetric recursive routing has been that
        one or more peers along the request path may fail before the response
        is received. The significance of this problem essentially depends on
        the response latency of the overlay. An overlay that produces slow
        responses will be vulnerable to churn, whereas responses that are
        delivered very quickly are vulnerable only to failures that occur over
        that small interval.
</p>
<p>The other aspect of this issue is whether the request itself can be
        successfully delivered. Assuming typical connection maintenance
        intervals, the time period between the last maintenance and the
        request being sent will be orders of magnitude greater than the delay
        between the request being forwarded and the response being received.
        Therefore, if the path was stable enough to be available to route the
        request, it is almost certainly going to remain available to route the
        response.
</p>
<p>An overlay that is unstable enough to suffer this type of failure
        frequently is unlikely to be able to support reliable functionality
        regardless of the routing mechanism. However, regardless of the
        stability of the return path, studies show that in the event of high
        churn, iterative routing is a better solution to ensure request
        completion <a class='info' href='#lookups-churn-p2p06'>[lookups&#8209;churn&#8209;p2p06]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Wu, D., Tian, Y., and K. Ng, &ldquo;Analytical Study on Improving DHT Lookup Performance under           Churn,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a> <a class='info' href='#non-transitive-dhts-worlds05'>[non&#8209;transitive&#8209;dhts&#8209;worlds05]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Freedman, M., Lakshminarayanan, K., Rhea, S., and I. Stoica, &ldquo;Non-Transitive Connectivity and DHTs,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>
</p>
<p>Finally, because RELOAD retries the end-to-end request, that retry
        will address the issues of churn that remain.

Why Clients?</h3>

<p>There are a wide variety of reasons a node may act as a client rather
      than as a peer <a class='info' href='#I-D.pascual-p2psip-clients'>[I&#8209;D.pascual&#8209;p2psip&#8209;clients]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Pascual, V., Matuszewski, M., Shim, E., Zhang, H., and S. Yongchao, &ldquo;P2PSIP Clients,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>. This
      section outlines some of those scenarios and how the client's behavior
      changes based on its capabilities.

<a name="rfc.section.B.1"></a><h3>B.1.&nbsp;
Why Not Only Peers?</h3>

<p>For a number of reasons, a particular node may be forced to act as
        a client even though it is willing to act as a peer. These
        include:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The node does not have appropriate network connectivity,
            typically because it has a low-bandwidth network connection.
</li>
<li>The node may not have sufficient resources, such as computing
            power, storage space, or battery power.
</li>
<li>The overlay algorithm may dictate specific requirements for
            peer selection. These may include participating in the overlay to
            determine trustworthiness; controlling the number of peers in the
            overlay to reduce overly-long routing paths; or ensuring minimum
            application uptime before a node can join as a peer.
</li>
</ul>

<p>The ultimate criteria for a node to become a peer are determined by
        the overlay algorithm and specific deployment. A node acting as a
        client that has a full implementation of RELOAD and the appropriate
        overlay algorithm is capable of locating its responsible peer in the
        overlay and using Attach to establish a direct connection to that
        peer. In that way, it may elect to be reachable under either of the
        routing approaches listed above. Particularly for overlay algorithms
        that elect nodes to serve as peers based on trustworthiness or
        population, the overlay algorithm may require such a client to locate
        itself at a particular place in the overlay.

Clients as Application-Level Agents</h3>

<p>SIP defines an extensive protocol for registration and security
        between a client and its registrar/proxy server(s). Any SIP device can
        act as a client of a RELOAD-based P2PSIP overlay if it contacts a peer
        that implements the server-side functionality required by the SIP
        protocol. In this case, the peer would be acting as if it were the
        user's peer, and would need the appropriate credentials for that
        user.
</p>
<p>Application-level support for clients is defined by a usage. A
        usage offering support for application-level clients should specify
        how the security of the system is maintained when the data is moved
        between the application and RELOAD layers.
