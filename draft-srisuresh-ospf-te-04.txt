Abstract
   
   This document defines OSPF-TE, an experimental traffic engineering
   (TE) extension to the link-state routing protocol OSPF. New TE 
   LSAs are designed to disseminate TE metrics within an autonomous 
   System (AS) - intra-area as well as inter-area. An Autonomous 
   System may consist of TE and non-TE nodes. Non-TE nodes are 
   uneffected by the distribution of TE LSAs. A stand-alone TE Link
   State Database (TE-LSDB), separate from the native OSPF LSDB, is
   generated for the computation of TE circuit paths. OSPF-TE is 
   also extendible to non-packet networks such as SONET/TDM and 
   optical networks. A transition path is provided for those
   currently using [OPQLSA-TE] and wish to adapt OSPF-TE.

1. Introduction

   This document defines OSPF-TE, an experimental traffic engineering
   (TE) extension to the link-state routing protocol OSPF. The 
   objective of OSPF-TE is to discover TE network topology and 
   disseminate TE metrics within an autonomous system(AS).  A 
   stand-alone TE Link State Database (TE-LSDB), different from 
   the native OSPF LSDB, is created to facilitate computation of TE 
   circuit paths. Algorithms to compute TE circuit paths is however 
   not the objective of this document.

   OSPF-TE is different from the Opaque-LSA-based design outlined 
   in [OPQLSA-TE]. Section 4 describes the motivations behind the
   design of OSPF-TE. Section 6 outlines a strategy to transition 
   Opaque-LSA based implementations to adapt OSPF-TE.

   Those interested in TE extensions for the packet networks only
   may skip section 9.0.


2. Principles of traffic engineering

   The objective of traffic engineering is to set up circuit
   path(s) between a pair of nodes or links and to forward traffic
   of a certain forwarding equivalency class through the circuit
   path. Only the unicast circuit paths are considered here.
   Multicast variations are out of scope for this document.

   A traffic engineered circuit path may be identified by the 
   tuple of (Forwarding Equivalency Class, TE parameters for the 



Srisuresh & Joseph                                              [Page 3]

Internet-Draft             OSPF TE extensions              December 2002


   circuit, Origin Node/Link, Destination node/Link).

   Forwarding Equivalency Class (FEC) is a grouping of traffic
   that is forwarded in the same manner by a node. A FEC may be 
   classified based on a number of criteria as follows.
        a) Traffic arriving on a specific interface, 
        b) Traffic arriving at a certain time of day,
        c) Traffic meeting a certain classification criteria 
           (ex: based on a match of the fields in the IP and 
           transport headers), 
        d) Traffic in a certain priority class, 
        e) Traffic arriving on a specific set of TDM (STS) circuits 
           on an interface, 
        f) Traffic arriving on a certain wavelength of an interface

   Discerning traffic based on the FEC criteria is mandatory for 
   Label Edge Routers (LERs). The intermediate Label Switched Routers
   (LSRs) are transparent to the traffic content. LSRs are merely 
   responsible for keeping the circuit in-tact for the circuit 
   lifetime. This document will not address defining FEC criteria,
   or the mapping of a FEC to circuit, or the associated signaling to 
   set up circuits. [MPLS-TE] and [GMPLS-TE] address the FEC criteria. 
   [RSVP-TE] and [CR-LDP] address signaling protocols to set up
   circuits.

   This document is concerned with the collection of TE metrics for
   all the TE enforceable nodes and links within an autonomous system. 
   TE metrics for a node may include the following.
        a) Ability to perform traffic prioritization,
        b) Ability to provision bandwidth on interfaces, 
        c) Support for Constrained Shortest Path First (CSPF)
           algorithms, 
        d) Support for certain TE-Circuit switch type, 
        e) Support for a certain type of automatic protection
           switching

   TE metrics for a link may include the following.
        a) Available bandwidth, 
        b) Reliability of the link, 
        c) Color assigned to the link, 
        d) Cost of bandwidth usage on the link, 
        e) Membership to a Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG)

   A number of CSPF algorithms may be used to dynamically set up
   TE circuit paths in a TE network. 

   As for origin node/link and destination node/link, the originating
   and the terminating entities of a TE circuit path are identifiable

   by their IP addresses.


3. Terminology
   
   Definitions of terms used in the context of the OSPF protocol may be 
   found in [OSPF-V2]. MPLS and traffic engineering terms may be found 
   in [MPLS-ARCH]. RSVP-TE and CR-LDP signaling specific terms may be 
   found in [RSVP-TE] and [CR-LDP] respectively. 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALLNOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in [IETF-STD].

   Below are definitions for the terms used within this document.

3.1. TE node

   TE-Node is a node in the traffic engineered (TE) network. A 
   TE-node has a minimum of one TE-link attached to it. Associated
   with each TE node is a set of supported TE metrics. A TE node
   may also participate in a native IP network.

   In a SONET/TDM or photonic cross-connect network, a TE node is
   not required to be an OSPF-TE router. An external OSPF-TE router
   may act as proxy for the TE nodes that cannot be routers
   themselves.

3.2. TE link

   TE Link is a network attachment point to a TE-node and is
   intended for traffic engineering use. Associated with each
   TE link is a set of supported TE metrics. A TE link may also
   optionally carry native IP traffic.

   Of the various links attached to a TE-node, only the links that 
   take part in a traffic engineered network are called the TE
   links.

3.3. TE circuit path

   A TE circuit path is a uni-directional data path, defined by a
   list of TE nodes connected to each other through TE links. A
   TE circuit path is also often referred merely as a circuit path
   or a circuit.

   For the purposes of OSPF-TE, the originating and terminating
   entities of a TE circuit path must be identifiable by their



Srisuresh & Joseph                                              [Page 5]

Internet-Draft             OSPF TE extensions              December 2002


   IP addresses. As a general rule, all nodes and links party to a
   Traffic Engineered network should be uniquely identifiable by an
   IP address. 

3.4. OSPF-TE node
       
   An OSPF-TE node is a TE node that runs the OSPF routing protocol
   and the OSPF-TE extensions described in this document. 

   An autonomous system (AS) may be constituted of a combination of 
   native and OSPF-TE nodes. 

3.5. TE Control network

   The IP network used by the OSPF-TE nodes for OSPF-TE
   communication is referred as the TE control network or simply
   the control network. The control network can be independent of
   the TE data network. 

3.6. TE network (TE topology)

   A TE network is a network of connected TE-nodes and TE-links
   for the purpose of setting up one or more TE circuit paths.
   The terms TE network, TE data network and TE topology are
   used synonymously throughout the document. 

3.7. Packet-TE network
  
   A packet-TE network is a TE network in which the nodes switch
   MPLS packets. An MPLS packet is defined in [MPLS-TE] as a
   packet with an MPLS header, followed by data octets. The
   intermediary node(s) of a circuit path in a packet-TE network
   perform MPLS label swapping to emulate the circuit.

   Unless specified otherwise, the term packet network is used
   throughout the document to refer a packet-TE network.

3.8. Non-packet-TE network

   A non-packet-TE network is TE-network in which the nodes 
   switch non-packet entities such as an STS time slot, a Lambda
   wavelength or simply an interface.

   SONET/TDM and Fiber cross-connect networks are examples of 
   non-packet-TE networks. Circuit emulation in these networks
   is accomplished by the switch fabric in the intermediary 
   nodes (based on TDM time slot, fiber interface or Lambda).

Internet-Draft             OSPF TE extensions              December 2002


   Unless specified otherwise, the term non-packet network is
   used throughout the document to refer a non-packet-TE
   network.

3.9. Native (non-TE) node

   A native or non-TE node is an OSPF router capable of IP packet
   forwarding and does not take part in a TE network. A native
   OSPF node forwards IP traffic using the shortest-path
   forwarding algorithm and does not run the OSPF-TE extensions.

3.10. Native (non-TE) link

   A native (or non-TE) link is a network attachment to a TE or
   non-TE node used for IP packet traversal. 

3.11. non-TE network (Non-TE topology)

   A non-TE network refers to an OSPF network that does not 
   support TE. Non-TE network, native-OSPF network and non-TE 
   topology are used synonymously throughout the document.

3.12. Peer network (combination network)

   A peer network is a network that is constituted of packet
   and non-packet networks combined. In a peer network, a TE
   node could potentially support TE links for the packet as
   well as non-packet data.

   OSPF-TE is usable within a packet network or a non-packet 
   network or a peer network, which is a combination of the two. 

3.13. LSP

   LSP stands for "Label Switched Path". LSP is a TE circuit path 
   in a packet network. The terms LSP and TE circuit path are
   used synonymously in the context of packet networks.

3.14. LSA

   LSA stands for OSPF "Link State Advertisement".

3.15. LSDB

   LSDB stands for "LSA Database". LSDB is a representation of the
   topology of a network. A native LSDB, constituted of native OSPF 
   LSAs, represents the topology of a native IP network. TE-LSDB, on
   the other hand, is constituted of TE LSAs and is a representation



Srisuresh & Joseph                                              [Page 7]

Internet-Draft             OSPF TE extensions              December 2002


   of the TE network topology.

3.16. CSPF

   CSPF stands for "Constrained Shortest Path First". Given a TE 
   LSDB and a set of constraints that must be satisfied to form a 
   circuit path, there may be several CSPF algorithms to obtain a
   TE circuit path that meets the criteria.

3.17. TLV

   A TLV stands for an object in the form of Tag-Length-Value. All
   TLVs are assumed to be of the following format, unless specified
   otherwise. The Tag and length are 16 bits wide each. The length
   includes the 4 octets required for Tag and Length specification.
   All TLVs described in this document are padded to 32-bit
   alignment. Any padding required for alignment will not be a part
   of the length field, however. TLVs are used to describe traffic
   engineering characteristics of the TE nodes, TE links and TE circuit
   paths.

4. Motivations behind the design of OSPF-TE

   There are several motivations that lead to the design of OSPF-TE.
   OSPF-TE is scalable, coexistent and efficient in flooding reach. 
   The motivations are explained in detail in the following 
   subsections. Also listed in the last subsection are network 
   scenarios that benefit from the OSPF-TE design.



Srisuresh & Joseph                                              [Page 8]

Internet-Draft             OSPF TE extensions              December 2002



4.1. Scalable design

   Area level abstraction provides the scaling necessary for a large
   autonomous system (AS). OSPF-TE allows for independent area 
   abstractions for the TE and native topologies. The TE and native 
   area border routers will advertise different summary LSAs to TE 
   and non-TE routers. Readers may refer section 10 for a 
   topological view of the AS from an OSPF-TE node in an area.

4.2. Coexistent design

   OSPF-TE regards an AS as constituted of a TE and non-TE networks
   coexisting within the same bounds. OSPF-TE dynamically discovers
   TE topology and the associated TE metrics of the nodes and links
   within, just as the native OSPF does in a non-TE network. An
   independent TE-LSDB, representative of the TE topology is 
   generated as a result. A stand-alone TE-LSDB allows for speedy
   searches through the database.

   In [OPQLSA-TE], the TE-LSDB is derived from the combination of
   opaque LSAs and native LSDB. The TE-LSDB derived has no
   knowledge of the TE capabilities of the routers in the network. 

4.3. Efficient in flooding reach

   OSPF-TE is capable of identifying the boundaries of a TE topology
   and limits the flooding of TE LSAs to only the TE-nodes. Non-TE 
   nodes are not bombarded with TE LSAs. This is a useful 
   characteristic for networks supporting native and TE traffic in 
   the same connected network.

   A subset of the TE metrics may be prone to rapid change, while 
   others remain largely unchanged. Changes in TE metrics must be 
   communicated at the earliest throughout the network to ensure 
   that the TE-LSDB is up-to-date within the network. As a general
   rule, a TE network is likely to generate significantly more
   control traffic than a native OSPF network. The excess traffic
   is almost directly proportional to the rate at which TE circuits
   are set up and torn down within the TE network. The TE database
   synchronization should occur much quicker compared to the
   aggregate circuit set up and tear-down rates.
   TE-Incremental-Link-update LSA (section 8.2) permits advertising 
   a subset of the link metrics.  

   The more frequent and wider the flooding frequency, the larger 
   the number of retransmissions and acknowledgements. The same
   information (needed or not) may reach a router through multiple



Srisuresh & Joseph                                              [Page 9]

Internet-Draft             OSPF TE extensions              December 2002


   links. Even if the router did not forward the information past
   the node, it would still have to send acknowledgements across
   all the various links on which the LSAs tried to converge.
   It is undesirable to flood non-TE nodes with TE information.

   [OPQLSA-TE] uses Opaque LSAs for advertising TE information.
   Opaque LSAs reach all nodes within the network - TE-nodes and
   non-TE nodes alike. [OPQLSA-TE] also does not have provision 
   to advertise just the TLVs that changed. A change in any TLV 
   of a TE-link will mandate the entire LSA to be transmitted. 

4.4. Ability to reserve TE-exclusive links

   OSPF-TE is designed to draw distinction between TE-links and
   non-TE links. A TE link, configured to support TE traffic
   alone, will not permit best-effort IP traffic on the link.
   This permits TE enforceability on the TE links.

   When links of a TE-topology do not overlap the links of a
   native IP network, OSPF-TE allows for virtual isolation of
   the two networks. Best-effort IP transit network and
   constraint based TE network often have different service
   requirements. Keeping the two networks physically isolated
   will enable SLA enforceability, but can be expensive. Combining
   the two networks into a single physically connected network
   will bring economies of scale, if the service enforceability
   can be retained. 

   [OPQLSA-TE] does not support the ability to isolate best-
   effort IP traffic from TE traffic on a link. All links are
   subject to best-effort IP traffic. An OSPF router could
   potentially select a TE link to be its least cost link and
   inundate the link with best-effort IP traffic, thereby
   rendering the link unusable for TE purposes.

4.5. Extendible design

   OSPF-TE design is based on the tried and tested OSPF paradigm, 
   and inherits all the benefits of the OSPF, present and future. 
   TE-LSAs are extendible, just as the native OSPF on which OSPF-TE
   is founded. 

   [OPQLSA-TE], on the other hand, is constrained by the semantics
   of the Opaque LSA on which it is founded. The content within an 
   Opaque LSA is restricted to being in the form of TLVs and 
   sub-TLVs, some of which are mandatory and some of which are 
   positionally dependent in the TLV sequence for proper 
   interpretation. Opaque LSAs are also restrictive when the flooding 



Srisuresh & Joseph                                             [Page 10]

Internet-Draft             OSPF TE extensions              December 2002


   scope for the content is required to be different from the scope 
   of the opaque LSA itself.

4.6. Unified for packet and non-packet networks

   OSPF-TE is usable within a packet network or a non-packet 
   network or a combination peer network. 

   Signaling protocols such as RSVP and LDP work the same across
   packet and non-packet networks. Signaling protocols merely need 
   the TE characteristics of nodes and links so they can signal the 
   nodes to formulate TE circuit paths.  In a peer network, the 
   underlying control protocol must be capable of providing a 
   unified LSDB for all TE nodes (nodes with packet-TE links as well 
   as non-packet-TE links) in the network. OSPF-TE meets this 
   requirement.

   [OPQLSA-TE] is limited in scope for packet networks. An
   independent [OPQLSA-GMPLS] is required to support GMPLS links in 
   a non-packet network. Neither of the Opaque LSA based extensions 
   have provision to distinguish between node types.

4.7. Networks benefiting from the OSPF-TE design

   Many real-world networks are better served by the new-TE-LSAs
   scheme. Here are a few examples.

4.7.1. IP providers transitioning to provide TE services

   Providers needing to support MPLS based TE in their IP network 
   may choose to transition gradually. Perhaps, add new TE links
   or convert existing links into TE links within an area first
   and progressively advance to offer in the entire AS.  
   
   Not all routers will support TE extensions at the same time
   during the migration process. Use of TE specific LSAs and their
   flooding to OSPF-TE only nodes will allow the vendor to
   introduce MPLS TE without destabilizing the existing network.
   The native OSPF-LSDB will remain undisturbed while newer TE
   links are added to the network.

4.7.2. Providers offering Best-effort-IP & TE services

   Providers choosing to offer both best-effort-IP and TE based
   packet services simultaneously on the same physically connected
   network will benefit from the OSPF-TE design. By maintaining
   independent LSDBs for each type of service, TE links are not 
   cannibalized.

4.7.3. Large TE networks

   The OSPF-TE design is advantageous in large TE networks that 
   require the AS to be sub-divided into multiple areas.

4.7.4. Non-packet networks and Peer networks

   OSPF-TE is also the right choice for vendors opting for a
   stable, well-founded protocol for their non-IP TE networks. 
   OSPF-TE is uniquely qualified to support the following network 
   attachments in non-Packet TE networks.
      (a) "Positional-Ring" type network LSA and
      (b) Router Proxying - allowing a router to advertise on behalf
	  of other nodes (that are not Packet/OSPF capable).


5. OSPF-TE solution overview

5.1. OSPF-TE Solution

   A new TE flag is introduced within the OSPF options field to 
   to enable discovery of TE topology. Section 8.0 describes the 
   semantics of the TE flag. TE LSAs are designed for use by the 
   OSPF-TE nodes. Section 9.0 describes the TE LSAs in detail. 
   Changes required of the OSPF data structures to support 
   OSPF-TE are described in section 11.0. A new TE-neighbors data 
   structure will be used to flood TE LSAs along TE-topology. 

   An OSPF-TE node will have the native LSDB and the TE-LSDB, 
   A native OSPF node will have just the native LSDB.
   Consider the following OSPF area constituted of OSPF-TE and
   native OSPF routers. Nodes RT1, RT2, RT3 and RT6 are OSPF-TE 
   routers with TE and non-TE link attachments. Nodes RT4 and RT5 
   are native OSPF routers with no TE links. When the LSA database
   is synchronized, all nodes will share the same native LSDB
   OSPF-TE nodes alone will have the additional TE-LSDB.

5.2. Assumptions

   OSPF-TE is an extension to the native OSPF protocol and does not 
   mandate changes to the existing OSPF. OSPF-TE design makes the 
   following assumptions.

   1. An OSPF-TE node will need to establish router adjacency with 
      at least one other OSPF-TE node in the area in order for the 
      router's TE-database to be synchronized within the area. 
      Failing this, the OSPF router will not be in the TE 
      calculations of other TE routers in the area. 

      It is the responsibility of the network administrator(s) to 
      ensure connectedness of the TE network. Otherwise, there can
      be disjoint TE topologies within a network.

Internet-Draft             OSPF TE extensions              December 2002


   2. OSPF-TE nodes must advertise the link state of its TE-links.
      TE-links are not obligated to support native IP traffic. 
      Hence, an OSPF-TE node cannot be required to synchronize
      its link-state database with neighbors on all its links.
      The only requirement is to have the TE LSDB synchronized
      across all OSPF-TE nodes in the area. Refer [FLOOD-OPT] for
      flooding optimizations. 

   3. A link in a packet network may be designated as a TE-link or 
      a native-IP link or both. For example, a link may be used for 
      both TE and non-TE traffic, so long as the link is 
      under-subscribed in bandwidth for TE traffic - say, 50% of
      the link capacity is set aside for TE traffic. 

   4. Non-packet TE sub-topologies MUST have a minimum of one node 
      running OSPF-TE protocol.  For example, a SONET/SDH TDM ring 
      must have a minimum of one Gateway Network Element(GNE) 
      running OSPF-TE. The OSPF-TE node will advertise on behalf 
      of all the in the ring. 


6. Opaque LSAs to OSPF-TE transition strategy

   Below is a strategy to transition implementations using opaque
   LSAs to adapt the OSPF-TE scheme in a gradual fashion.

   1. Restrict the use of Opaque-LSAs to within an area.
     
   2. Fold in the TE option flag to construct the TE topologies 
      area-wise. By doing this, the TE topology for the AS will
      be available at area level abstraction. 

   3. Use TE-Summary LSAs and TE-AS-external-LSAs for inter-area 
      Communication. Make use of the TE-topology within an area to
      summarize the TE networks in the area and advertise the same
      to all TE-routers in the backbone. The TE-ABRs on the backbone
      area will in-turn advertise these summaries within their
      connected areas. 


7. OSPF-TE router adjacency - TE topology discovery

   OSPF creates adjacencies between neighboring routers for the purpose
   of exchanging routing information. In the following subsections, we
   describe modifications to the OSPF options field and the use of
   Hello protocol to establish TE capability compliance between
   neighboring routers in an area. The capability is used as the basis
   to build TE topology.

Internet-Draft             OSPF TE extensions              December 2002


   
7.1. The OSPF Options field

   A new TE flag is introduced within the options field by this draft 
   to identify TE extensions to the OSPF. This bit will be used to
   distinguish routers that support OSPF-TE. The OSPF options field
   is present in OSPF Hello packets, Database Description packets,
   and all link state advertisements. The TE bit, however, is a
   requirement only for the Hello packets. Use of TE-bit is optional
   in Database Description packets or LSAs.
 
   Below is a description of the TE-Bit. Refer [OSPF-V2], [OSPF-NSSA]
   and [OPAQUE] for a description of the remaining bits in the 
   options field.

		   --------------------------------------
		   |TE | O | DC | EA | N/P | MC | E | * |
		   --------------------------------------
		   The OSPF options field - TE support


   TE-Bit: This bit is set to indicate support for traffic engineering
	   extensions to the OSPF. The Hello protocol which is used for 
	   establishing router adjacency will use the TE-bit to
           establish OSPF-TE adjacency. Two routers will not become
           TE-neighbors unless they agree on the state of the TE-bit.
           TE-compliant OSPF extensions are advertised only to the
           TE-compliant routers. All other routers may simply ignore
           the advertisements. 

   There is however a caveat with the above use of the last remaining
   reserved bit in the options field. OSPF v2 will have no more
   reserved bits left for future option extensions. If deemed 
   necessary to leave this bit as is, the OPAQUE-9 LSA (local scope)
   can be used on each interface to communicate the support for
   OSPF-TE. 

7.2.  The Hello Protocol

   The Hello Protocol is primarily responsible for dynamically
   establishing and maintaining neighbor adjacencies. In a TE network,
   it is not required for all links and neighbors to establish 
   adjacency using this protocol. The Hello protocol will use the
   TE-bit to establish traffic engineering capability between two 
   OSPF routers. 
   
   For NBMA and broadcast networks, this protocol is responsible for
   electing the Designated Router and the Backup Designated Router.



Srisuresh & Joseph                                             [Page 15]

Internet-Draft             OSPF TE extensions              December 2002


   For a TDM ring network, the designated and backup designated
   routers may either be preselected (ex: GNE, backup-GNE) or
   determined via the same Hello protocol. In any case, routers
   supporting the TE option shall be given a higher precedence for
   becoming a designated router over those that do not support TE.

   If deemed necessary to leave the TE-bit unused in the options
   field, the OSPF-TE routers could use OPAQUE-9 LSA (local scope)
   to communicate TE capability between two OSPF routers.

7.3.  The Designated Router

   The Designated Router is elected by the Hello Protocol on broadcast
   and NBMA networks. In general, when a router's non-TE link first
   becomes functional, it checks to see whether there is currently a 
   Designated Router for the network. If there is one, it accepts that
   Designated Router, regardless of its Router Priority, so long as
   the current designated router is TE compliant. Otherwise,
   the router itself becomes Designated Router if it has the highest
   Router Priority on the network and is TE compliant.  

   TE-compliance (I.e., OSPF-TE) must be implemented on the most robust 
   routers, as they become likely candidates to take on the role as 
   designated router.

   Alternatively, there can be two sets of designated routers, one for 
   the TE compliant routers and another for the native OSPF routers 
   (non-TE compliant).

7.4.  The Backup Designated Router

   The Backup Designated Router is also elected by the Hello
   Protocol.  Each Hello Packet has a field that specifies the
   Backup Designated Router for the network. Once again, TE-compliance
   must be weighed in conjunction with router priority in electing
   the backup designated router. 

   Alternatively, there can be two sets of backup designated routers, 
   one for the TE compliant routers and another for the native OSPF 
   routers (non-TE compliant).

7.5. Flooding and the Synchronization of Databases

   In OSPF, adjacent routers within an area must synchronize their
   databases. However, as observed in [FLOOD-OPT], a more concise
   requirement of OSPF is that all routers in an area must converge 
   on the same link state database. It is sufficient to send a
   single copy of the LSAs to the neighboring routers in an area



Srisuresh & Joseph                                             [Page 16]

Internet-Draft             OSPF TE extensions              December 2002


   than send one copy on each connected interface. [FLOOD-OPT]
   describes in detail how to minimize flooding (Initial LSDB
   synchronization as well as the asynchronous LSA updates) within
   an area. 

   In the case where some of the neighbors are TE compliant and
   others are not, the designated OSPF-TE router will exchange 
   different sets of LSAs with its neighbors. TE LSAs are
   exchanged only with the TE neighbors. Native LSAs are
   exchanged with all neighbors (TE and non-TE alike). 

   A new OSPFIGP-TE multicast address 224.0.0.24 may be used for 
   the exchange of TE compliant database descriptors. Flooding
   optimization in a TE network is essential as the control
   traffic for a TE network is likely to be higher than that of a 
   non-TE network. Flooding optimization will help minimize LSA 
   announcements and the associated retransmissions and 
   acknowledgements on the network.
   
7.6.  The graph of adjacencies

   If two routers have multiple networks in common, they may have
   multiple adjacencies between them. The adjacency may be one of
   two types - native OSPF adjacency and TE adjacency. OSPF-TE
   routers will form both types of adjacency.

   Two types of adjacency graphs are possible depending on whether
   a Designated Router is elected for the network. On physical 
   point-to-point networks, Point-to-Multipoint networks and
   Virtual links, neighboring routers become adjacent whenever they
   can communicate directly.  The adjacency can be one of 
   (a) TE-compliant or (b) native. In contrast, on broadcast and
   NBMA networks the designated router and the backup designated
   router may maintain two sets of adjacency. The remaining routers
   will form either TE-compliant or native adjacency. In the 
   Broadcast network below, routers RT7 and RT3 are chosen as the
   designated and backup routers respectively. Routers RT3, RT4 
   and RT7 are TE-compliant. RT5 and RT6 are not. So, RT4 will 
   have TE and native adjacencies with the designated and backup
   routers. RT5 and RT6 will only have native adjacency with the
   designated and backup routers.

8. TE LSAs - Packet network

   The OSPFv2 protocol, as of now, has a total of 11 LSA types.
   LSA types 1 through 5 are defined in [OSPF-v2]. LSA types 6, 7 
   and 8 are defined in [MOSPF], [NSSA] and [BGP-OSPF] respectively.
   LSA types 9 through 11 are defined in [OPAQUE]. 

   Each LSA type has a unique flooding scope. Opaque LSA types
   9 through 11 are general purpose LSAs, with flooding
   scope set to link-local, area-local and AS-wide (except stub
   areas) respectively. 
 
   In the following subsections, we define new LSAs for traffic
   engineering (TE) use. The Values for the new TE LSA types are
   assigned such that the high bit of the LSA-type octet is set 
   to 1. The new TE LSAs are largely modeled after the existing
   LSAs for content format and have a unique flooding scope. 

   TE-router LSA is defined to advertise TE characteristics of 
   an OSPF-TE router and all the TE-links attached to the
   router. TE-incremental-Link-Update LSA is defined to
   advertise incremental updates to the metrics of a TE link.
   Flooding scope for both these LSAs is restricted to the 
   TE nodes in the area.



Srisuresh & Joseph                                             [Page 18]

Internet-Draft             OSPF TE extensions              December 2002



   TE-Summary network and router LSAs are defined to advertise 
   the reachability of area-specific TE networks and Area Border 
   Routers (along with router TE characteristics) to external
   areas. Flooding Scope of the TE-Summary LSAs is the TE topology
   in the entire AS less the non-backbone area for which the 
   the advertising router is an ABR. Just as with native OSPF
   summary LSAs, the TE-summary LSAs do not reveal the topological
   details of an area to external areas. 

   TE-AS-external LSA and TE-Circuit-Path LSA are defined to
   advertise AS external network reachability and pre-engineered
   TE circuits respectively. While flooding scope for both these
   LSAs can be the entire AS, flooding scope for the
   pre-engineered TE circuit LSA may optionally be restricted to
   just the TE topology within an area. 

8.1. TE-Router LSA (0x81)

   The TE-router LSA (0x81) is modeled after the router LSA and has the
   same flooding scope as the router-LSA. However, the scope is
   restricted to only the OSPF-TE nodes within the area. The TE-router
   LSA describes the TE metrics of the router as well as the TE-links
   attached to the router. Below is the format of the TE-router LSA.
   Unless specified explicitly otherwise, the fields carry the same
   meaning as they do in a router LSA. Only the differences are
   explained below. Router-TE flags, Router-TE TLVs, Link-TE options,
   and Link-TE TLVs are each described in the following sub-sections.

	In TE-capable router nodes, the TE-bit may be set to 1.

8.1.1. Router-TE flags - TE capabilities of the router

   The following flags are used to describe the TE capabilities of an
   OSPF-TE router. The remaining bits of the 32-bit word are reserved 
   for future use.

	   When set, the router is considered to have LER capability.
	   All MPLS border routers will be required to have the LER
	   capability. When the E bit is also set, that indicates an
	   AS Boundary router with LER capability. When the B bit is

8.1.2. Router-TE TLVs

   The following Router-TE TLVs are defined.
 
8.1.2.4. TE-NODE-TLV-MPLS-SWITCHING

   MPLS switching TLV is applicable only for packet switched nodes. The
   TLV specifies the MPLS packet switching capabilities of the TE
   node. 

	0                   1                   2                   3

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   'Label depth' is the depth of label stack the node is capable of
   processing on its ingress interfaces. An octet is used to represent
   label depth. A default value of 1 is assumed when the TLV is not
   listed. 

   'QOS' is a single octet field that may be assigned '1' or '0'. Nodes
   supporting QOS are able to interpret the EXP bits in the MPLS header
   to prioritize multiple classes of traffic through the same LSP.

8.1.2.2. TE-NODE-TLV-MPLS-SIG-PROTOCOLS

   MPLS signaling protocols TLV lists all the signaling protocol
   supported by the node. An octet is used to list each signaling
   protocol supported.

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   RSVP-TE protocol is represented as 1, CR-LDP as 2 and LDP as 3. 
   These are the only permitted signaling protocols at this time.
       
8.1.2.3. TE-NODE-TLV-CSPF-ALGORITHMS

   The CSPF algorithms TLV lists all the CSPF algorithm codes
   supported. Support for CSPF algorithms makes the node eligible to
   compute complete or partial circuit paths. Support for CSPF
   algorithms can also be beneficial in knowing whether or not a node
   is capable of expanding loose routes (in an MPLS signaling request)
   into a detailed circuit path. 

   Two octets are used to list each CSPF algorithm code. The algorithm
   codes may be vendor defined and unique within an Autonomous System.
   If the node supports 'n' CSPF algorithms, the Length would be 
   (4 + 4 * ((n+1)/2)) octets.

8.1.3. Link-TE flags - TE capabilities of a link

   The following flags are used to describe the TE capabilities of a
   link. The remaining bits of the 32-bit word are reserved for
   future use.

       |<---- Boolean TE flags ------->|<- TE flags pointing to TLVs ->|


       TE       - Indicates whether TE is permitted on the link. A link
		  can be denied for TE use by setting the flag to 0.

       NTE      - Indicates whether non-TE traffic is permitted on the
		  TE link. This flag is relevant only when the TE 
		  flag is set.

       PKT      - Indicates whether or not the link is capable of IP
		  packet processing.

       DBS      - Indicates whether or not Database synchronization

8.1.4. Link-TE TLVs

8.1.4.1. TE-LINK-TLV-SRLG

   The SRLG describes the list of Shared Risk Link Groups (SRLG) the
   link belongs to. Two octets are used to list each SRLG. If the link
   belongs to 'n' SRLGs, the Length would be (4 + 4 * ((n+1)/2)) octets.

8.1.4.2. TE-LINK-TLV-BANDWIDTH

   The bandwidth TLV specifies maximum bandwidth, bandwidth available
   for TE use and reserved bandwidth as follows.

       |                      Reserved Bandwidth                       |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   Bandwidth is expressed in units of 32 bytes/sec (256 bits/sec). 
   A 32-bit field for bandwidth would permit specification not exceeding
   1 tera-bits/sec.

   'Maximum bandwidth' is be the maximum link capacity expressed in
   bandwidth units. 

   'Bandwidth available for TE use' is the maximum reservable bandwidth
   on the link for use by all the TE circuit paths traversing the link.
   The link is oversubscribed when this field is more than the
   'Maximum Bandwidth'. When the field is less than the
   'Maximum Bandwidth', the remaining bandwidth on the link may likely
   be used for non-TE traffic.

   'Reserved Bandwidth' is the bandwidth that is currently subscribed
   from of the link. 'Reserved Bandwidth' must be less than the 
   'Bandwidth available for TE use'. New TE circuit paths are able to
   claim no more than the difference between the two bandwidths for
   reservation.

8.1.4.3. TE-LINK-TLV-LUG
	   
   The link usage cost TLV specifies Bandwidth unit usage cost, 
   TE circuit set-up cost, and any time constraints for setup and
   teardown of TE circuits on the link.

   Circuit Setup time constraint
       This 64-bit number specifies the time at or after which a
       TE-circuit path may be set up on the link. The set-up time
       constraint is specified as the number of seconds from the start
       of January 1, 1970 UTC. A reserved value of 0 implies no circuit
       setup time constraint.

   Circuit Teardown time constraint
       This 64-bit number specifies the time at or before which all
       TE-circuit paths using the link must be torn down. The teardown
       time constraint is specified as the number of seconds from the
       start of January 1 1970 UTC. A reserved value of 0 implies no 
       circuit teardown time constraint.

   No. of TE Circuit paths
       This specifies the number of pre-engineered TE circuit paths
       between the advertising router and the router specified in the 
       link state ID.


8.1.4.4. TE-LINK-TLV-COLOR

   The color TLV is similar to the SRLG TLV, in that an Autonomous
   System may choose to issue colors to a TE-link meeting certain
   criteria. The color TLV can be used to specify one or more colors
   assigned to the link as follows. Two octets are used to list each
   color. If the link belongs to 'n' number of colors, the Length
   would be (4 + 4 * ((n+1)/2)) octets.

8.2. TE-incremental-link-Update LSA (0x8d)

   A significant difference between a non-TE OSPF network and a TE OSPF
   network is that the latter may be subject to frequent real-time
   circuit pinning and is likely to undergo TE-state updates. Some
   links might undergo changes more frequently than others. Flooding
   the network with TE-router LSAs at the aggregated speed of all
   link metric changes is simply not desirable. A smaller in size,
   TE-incremental-link-update LSA is designed to advertise only the 
   incremental link updates. 

   TE-incremental-link-Update LSA will be advertised as frequently
   as the link state is changed. The TE-link sequence is largely the
   advertisement of a sub-portion of router LSA. The sequence number on
   this will be incremented with the TE-router LSA's sequence as the
   basis. When an updated TE-router LSA is advertised within 30 minutes
   of the previous advertisement, the updated TE-router LSA will assume
   a sequence no. that is larger than the most frequently updated of
   its links.

   Below is the format of the TE-incremental-link-update LSA.

   Link State ID
       This would be exactly the same as would have been specified as
       as Link ID for a link within the router-LSA.

   Link Data
       This specifies the router ID the link belongs to. In majority of
       cases, this would be same as the advertising router. This choice
       for Link Data is primarily to facilitate proxy advertisement for
       incremental link updates. 
       
       Say, a router-proxy-LSA was used to advertise the TE-router-LSA
       of a SONET/TDM node. Say, the proxy router is now required to
       advertise incremental-link-update for the same SONET/TDM node.
       Specifying the actual router-ID the link in the 
       incremental-link-update-LSA belongs to helps receiving nodes in
       finding the exact match for the LSA in their database.

   The tuple of (LS Type, LSA ID, Advertising router) uniquely identify
   the LSA and replace LSAs of the same tuple with an older sequence
   number. However, there is an exception to this rule in the context
   of TE-link-update LSA. TE-Link update LSA will initially assume the 
   sequence number of the TE-router LSA it belongs to. Further, when a
   new TE-router LSA update with a larger sequence number is advertised,
   the newer sequence number is assumed by al the link LSAs. 

8.3. TE-Circuit-path LSA (0x8C)

    TE-Circuit-path LSA may be used to advertise the availability of
    pre-engineered TE circuit path(s) originating from any router 
    in the network. The flooding scope may be Area wide or AS wide.

       This is the ID of the far-end router for a given TE-circuit 
       path segment. 

   Circuit-TE Data
       This is the virtual link identifier on the near-end router for
       a given TE-circuit path segment. This can be a private 
       interface or handle the near-end router uses to identify the 
       virtual link. 

       The sequence of (circuit-TE ID, Circuit-TE Data) list the
       end-point nodes and links in the LSA as a series.

   Circuit-TE flags
	This lists the Zero or more TE-link TLVs that all member
	elements of the LSP meet.

8.4. TE-Summary LSAs

    TE-Summary-LSAs are the Type 0x83 and 0x84 LSAs. These LSAs are 
    originated by area border routers. TE-Summary-network-LSA (0x83)
    describes the  reachability of TE networks in a non-backbone
    area, advertised by the Area Border Router. Type 0x84 
    summary-LSA describes the reachability of Area Border Routers
    and AS border routers and their TE capabilities.
 
    One of the benefits of having multiple areas within an AS is
    that frequent TE advertisements within the area do not impact
    outside the area. Only the TE abstractions befitting the
    external areas are advertised. 

8.4.1. TE-Summary Network LSA (0x83)

    TE-summary network LSA may be used to advertise reachability of 
    TE-networks accessible to areas external to the originating
    area. The content and the flooding scope of a TE-Summary LSA
    is different from that of a native summary LSA.

    The scope of flooding for a TE-summary network is AS wide, with
    the exception of the originating area and the stub areas. The
    area border router for each non-backbone area is responsible
    for advertising the reachability of backbone networks into the
    area. 

    Unlike a native-summary network LSA, TE-summary network LSA does
    not advertise summary costs to reach networks within an area.
    This is because TE parameters are not necessarily additive or
    comparative. The parameters can be varied in their expression.
    For example, a TE-summary network LSA will not summarize a

    network whose links do not fall under an SRLG (Shared-Risk Link
    Group). This way, the TE-summary LSA merely advertises the
    reachability of TE networks within an area. The specific circuit
    paths can be computed by the BDRs. Pre-engineered circuit paths 
    are advertised using TE-Circuit-path LSA (refer section 8.3).

   Link State ID
       The ID of the Area border router or the AS border router whose
       TE capability is being advertised. 

   Advertising Router 
       The ABR that advertises its TE capabilities (and the OSPF areas
       it belongs to) or the TE capabilities of an ASBR within one of
       the areas the ABR is a border router of.

   No. of Areas
       Specifies the number of OSPF areas the link state ID belongs to.

   Area-ID   
       Specifies the OSPF area(s) the link state ID belongs to. When
       the link state ID is same as the advertising router ID, the
       Area-ID lists all the areas the ABR belongs to. In the case
       the link state ID is an ASBR, the Area-ID simply lists the
       area the ASBR belongs to. The advertising router is assumed to
       be the ABR from the same area the ASBR is located in.

   Summary-router-TE flags

       Bit E - When set, the advertised Link-State ID is an AS boundary 
	       router (E is for external). The advertising router and 
	       the Link State ID belong to the same area.

       Bit B - When set, the advertised Link state ID is an Area
	       border router (B is for Border)

   Router-TE flags,
   Router-TE TLVs  (TE capabilities of the link-state-ID router)

       TE Flags and TE TLVs are as applicable to the ABR/ASBR 
       specified in the link state ID. The semantics is same as 
       specified in the Router-TE LSA.

8.5. TE-AS-external LSAs (0x85)

   TE-AS-external-LSAs are the Type 0x85 LSAs. This is modeled after
   AS-external LSA format and flooding scope. TE-AS-external LSAs are
   originated by AS boundary routers with TE extensions, and describe
   the TE networks and pre-engineered circuit paths external to the
   AS. As with AS-external LSA, the flooding scope of the
   TE-AS-external LSA is AS wide, with the exception of stub areas.

    Network Mask
	The IP address mask for the advertised TE destination.  For
	example, this can be used to specify access to a specific 
	TE-node or TE-link with an mask of 0xffffffff. This can also

Internet-Draft             OSPF TE extensions              December 2002


	be used to specify access to an aggregated set of destinations
	using a different mask. ex: 0xff000000.

    Link-TE flags,
    Link-TE TLVs
	The TE attributes of this route. These fields are optional and
	are provided only when one or more pre-engineered circuits can
	be specified with the advertisement. Without these fields,
	the LSA will simply state TE reachability info.

    Forwarding address
	Data traffic for the advertised destination will be forwarded to
	this address.  If the Forwarding address is set to 0.0.0.0, data
	traffic will be forwarded instead to the LSA's originator (i.e.,
	the responsible AS boundary router).

    External Route Tag
	A 32-bit field attached to each external route.  This is not
	used by the OSPF protocol itself.  It may be used to communicate
	information between AS boundary routers; the precise nature of
	such information is outside the scope of this specification.

 
9. TE LSAs - Non-packet network

   A non-packet network would use all the TE LSAs described in the
   previous section for a packet network, albeit with some variations.
   These variations are described in the following subsections.

   TE-Router-Proxy LSA is defined to allow proxy advertisement for
   non-packet TE-nodes by an  OSPF-TE router.

9.1. TE-Router LSA (0x81)

   The following fields are used to describe each router link (i.e.,
   interface). Each router link is typed (see the below Type field).
   The Type field indicates the kind of link being described. 

   Type
	A new link type "Positional-Ring Type" (value 5) is defined.
	This is essentially a connection to a TDM-Ring. TDM ring network
	is different from LAN/NBMA transit network in that nodes on the
	TDM ring do not necessarily have a terminating path between
	themselves. Secondly, the order of links is important in
	determining the circuit path. Third, the protection switching
	and the number of fibers from a node going into a ring are
	determined by the ring characteristics. I.e., 2-fiber vs 
	4-fiber ring and UPSR vs BLSR protected ring.

		 Type   Description

		 1      Point-to-point connection to another router
		 2      Connection to a transit network
		 3      Connection to a stub network
		 4      Virtual link
		 5      Positional-Ring Type.

   Link ID
	Identifies the object that this router link connects to.
	Value depends on the link's Type. For a positional-ring type,
	the Link ID shall be IP Network/Subnet number just as the case
        with a broadcast transit network. The following table
        summarizes the updated Link ID values.

		       Type   Link ID

		       3      IP network/subnet number
		       4      Neighboring router's Router ID
		       5      IP network/subnet number
       
   Link Data
	This depends on the link's Type field. For type-5 links, this
	specifies the router interface's IP address.
	     
9.1.1. Router-TE flags - TE capabilities of the router

   Flags specific to non-packet TE-nodes are described below.

       |<---- Boolean TE flags ------->|<- TE flags pointing to TLVs ->|


       TDM, LSC, FSC bits 
		- Same as defined for router TE options.

9.2. Changes to Network LSA

   Network-LSA is the Type 2 LSA. With the exception of the following,
   no additional changes will be required to this LSA for TE
   compatibility. The LSA format and flooding scope remains unchanged. 

   A network-LSA is originated for each broadcast, NBMA and 
   Positional-Ring type network in the area which supports two or
   more routers.  The TE option is also required to be set while 
   propagating the TDM network LSA. 
 
9.2.1. Positional-Ring type network LSA - New Network type for TDM-ring.
	- Ring ID: (Network Address/Mask)
	- No. of elements in the ring (a.k.a. ring neighbors)
	- Ring Bandwidth
	- Ring Protection (UPSR/BLSR)
	- ID of individual nodes (Interface IP address)
	- Ring type (2-Fiber vs. 4-Fiber, SONET vs. SDH)
   
   Network LSA is required for SONET RING. Unlike the broadcast
   type, the sequence in which the Network Elements (NEs) are 
   placed on a RING-network is pertinent. The nodes in the ring
   must be described clock wise, assuming the Gateway Network
   Element (GNE) as the starting element.
 
9.3. TE-Router-Proxy LSA (0x8e)

   This is a variation to the TE-router LSA in that the TE-router LSA
   is not advertised by the network element, but rather by a trusted 
   TE-router Proxy. This is typically the scenario in a non-packet
   TE network, where some of the nodes do not have OSPF functionality
   and count on a helper node to do the advertisement for them. One

   such example would be the SONET/SDH ADM nodes in a TDM ring. The
   nodes may principally depend upon the GNE (Gateway Network Element)
   to do the advertisement for them. TE-router-Proxy LSA shall not be
   used to advertise Area Border Routers and/or AS border Routers.

10. Abstract topology representation with TE support

   Below, we consider a TE network composed of three OSPF areas -
   Area-1, Area-2 and Area-3, attached together through the backbone
   area. Area-1 an has a single area border router, ABR-A1 and no
   ASBRs. Area-2 has an area border router ABR-A2 and an AS border

   router ASBR-S1. Area-3 has two area border routers ABR-A2 and
   ABR-A3 and an AS border router ASBR-S2. The following network
   also assumes a pre-engineered TE circuit path between ABR-A1
   and ABR-A2; between ABR-A1 and ABR-A3; between ABR-A2 and  
   ASBR-S1; and between ABR-A3 and ASBR-S2.
   
   The following figure is an inter-area topology abstraction
   from the perspective of routers in Area-1. The abstraction
   illustrates reachability of TE networks and nodes within area
   to the external areas in the same AS and to the external ASes. 
   The abstraction also illustrates pre-engineered TE circuit
   paths advertised by ABRs and ASBRs.

11. Changes to Data structures in OSPF-TE nodes

11.1. Changes to Router data structure

   The router with TE extensions must be able to include all the
   TE capabilities (as specified in section 7.1) in the router data
   structure. Further, routers providing proxy service to other TE
   routers must also track the router and associated interface data
   structures for all the TE client nodes for which the proxy
   service is being provided. Presumably, the interaction between
   the Proxy server and the proxy clients is out-of-band.

11.2. Two sets of Neighbors

   Two sets of neighbor data structures are required. TE-neighbors
   set is used to advertise TE LSAs. Only the TE-nodes will be
   members of the TE-neighbor set. Native neighbors set will be used
   to advertise native LSAs. All neighboring nodes supporting
   non-TE links are part of this set. As for flooding optimizations
   based on neighbors set, readers may refer [FLOOD-OPT].

11.3. Changes to Interface data structure

   The following new fields are introduced to the interface data
   structure. These changes are in addition to the changes specified
   in [FLOOD-OPT].

   TePermitted  
       If the value of the flag is TRUE, the interface may be
       advertised as a TE-enabled interface.

   NonTePermitted
       If the value of the flag is TRUE, the interface permits non-TE
       traffic on the interface. Specifically, this is applicable to
       packet networks, where data links may permit both TE and IP
       packets. For FSC and LSC TE networks, this flag is set to
       FALSE. 
     
   IpTerminated
       If the value of the flag is TRUE, the interface processes IP
       Packet data and hence may be used for OSPF data exchange.
   
   AdjacencySychRequired
       If the value of the flag is TRUE, the interface may be used to
       synchronize the LSDB across all adjacent neighbors. This is 
       TRUE by default to all IpTerminated interfaces that are
       enabled for OSPF. However, it is possible to set this to FALSE



Srisuresh & Joseph                                             [Page 40]

Internet-Draft             OSPF TE extensions              December 2002


       for some of the interfaces.

   TE-TLVs
       Each interface may potentially have a maximum of 16 TLVS that
       describe the link characteristics. 

   The following existing fields in Interface data structure will take
   on additional values to support TE extensions.

   Type
       The OSPF interface type can also be of type "Positional-RING".
       The Positional-ring type is different from other types (such 
       as broadcast and NBMA) in that the exact location of the nodes
       on the ring is relevant, even though they are all on the same 
       ring. SONET ADM ring is a good example of this. Complete ring 
       positional-ring description may be provided by the GNE on a 
       ring as a TE-network LSA for the ring.

12. IANA Considerations

   This document proposes that TE LSA types and TE TLVs be
   maintained by the IANA. The document also proposes an OSPFIGP-TE
   multicast address be assigned by the IANA for the exchange of 
   TE database descriptors. 

   OSPFIGP-TE multicast address is suggested a value of 224.0.0.24
   so as not to conflict with the recognized multicast address
   definitions, as defined in
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/multicast-addresses

   The following sub-section explains the criteria to be used by the
   IANA to assign TE LSA types and TE TLVs. 

12.1. TE LSA type values

   LSA type is an 8-bit field required by each LSA. TE LSA types
   will have the high bit set to 1. TE LSAs can range from 0x80 
   through 0xFF. The following values are defined in sections 
   8.0 and 9.0. The remaining values are available for assignment
   by the IANA with IETF Consensus [Ref 11].

12.2. TE TLV tag values

   TLV type is a 16-bit field required by each TE TLV. TLV type 
   shall be unique across the router and link TLVs. A TLV type
   can range from 0x0001 through 0xFFFF. TLV type 0 is reserved
   and unassigned. The following TLV types are defined in sections 
   8.0 and 9.0. The remaining values are available for assignment
   by the IANA with IETF Consensus [Ref 11].

14. Security Considerations

   Security considerations for the base OSPF protocol are covered
   in [OSPF-v2] and [SEC-OSPF]. This memo does not create any new
   security issues for the OSPF protocol. Security measures
   applied to the native OSPF (refer [SEC-OSPF]) are directly

   applicable to the TE LSAs described in the document. Discussed
   below are the security considerations in processing TE LSAs.

   Secure communication between OSPF-TE nodes has a number of
   components.  Authorization, authentication, integrity and
   confidentiality.  Authorization refers to whether a particular
   OSPF-TE node is authorized to receive or propagate the TE LSAs
   to its neighbors. Failing the authorization process might
   indicate a resource theft attempt or unauthorized resource
   advertisement. In either case, the OSPF-TE nodes should take
   proper measures to audit/log such attempts so as to alert the
   administrator to take necessary action. OSPF-TE nodes may refuse
   to communicate with the neighboring nodes that fail to prompt
   the required credentials.
   
   Authentication refers to confirming the identity of an originator
   for the datagrams received from the originator.  Lack of strong
   credentials for authentication of OSPF-TE LSAs can seriously
   jeopardize the TE service rendered by the network. A consequence
   of not authenticating a neighbor would be that an attacker could
   spoof the identity of a "legitimate" OSPF-TE node and manipulate
   the state, and the TE database including the topology and
   metrics collected. This could potentially lead to
   denial-of-service on the TE network. Another consequence of not
   authenticating is that an attacker could pose as OSPF-TE neighbor
   and respond in a manner that would divert TE data to the attacker.
   
   Integrity is required to ensure that an OSPF-TE message has not
   been accidentally or maliciously altered or destroyed. The result
   of a lack of data integrity enforcement in an untrusted environment
   could be that an imposter will alter the messages sent by a
   legitimate adjacent neighbor and bring the OSPF-TE on a node and
   the whole network to a halt or cause a denial of service for the
   TE circuit paths effected by the alteration.

   Confidentiality of MIDCOM messages ensure that the TE LSAs are
   accessible only to the authorized entities. When OSPF-TE is
   deployed in an untrusted environment, lack of confidentiality will
   allow an intruder to perform traffic flow analysis and snoop the
   TE control network to monitor the traffic metrics and the rate at
   which circuit paths are being setup and torn-down.  The intruder
   could cannibalize a lesser secure OSPF-TE node and destroy or
   compromise the state and TE-LDSB on the node. Needless to say, the
   least secure OSPF-TE will become the achilles heel and make the TE
   network vulnerable to security attacks.
