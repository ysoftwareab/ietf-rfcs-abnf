    Delayed acknowledgement transmission time consideration in QUIC
                     draft-jaehwoon-quic-delayed-ack-01


Abstract
   
   This draft defines a frame type called delayed ack timer. Packet
   transmission time and retransmission time-out (RTO) timer setup 
   value are included in the frame. The sender can send the frame 
   with the non real-time stream frame within an packet.

1.  Introduction

   QUIC is a multiplexed and secure transport protocol that runs on top
   of UDP and can provide a flexible set of features that allow it to be
   a general-purpose transport for multiple applications [1].
   In order to provide the secure communication, loss detection and 
   congestion control is defined for QUIC [2]. There can be either 
   real-time traffic or non real-time traffic. In case of real-time 
   traffic, a receiver should transmit an ack frame immediately whenever 
   it receives a packet sent from a sender. The push bit in TCP is 
   defined for this purpose. However, the receiver doesn't need to send 
   an ack frame immediately per every received packet containing non 
   real-time data stream. The receiver can send an accumulated ack frame 
   for several packet in order to reduce the number of packet containing 
   only an ack frame. In this case, if an ack frame transmitted by the 
   receiver arrives at the sender lately, then RTO timer is expired in 
   the sender which incurs the packet re-transmission. One way to avoid 
   retransmission of packet is to use the static timer for delaying 
   sending ack frame such as TCP. The other way is to use the timer to 
   dynamically adjust based on the transmission time and the 
   retransmission time-out timer value sent by the sender. In this case, 
   if we can know the one-way latency from the receiver to the sender, 
   the it is possible to precisely set the timer value [3].
   
   In this draft, we define the frame called delayed ack containing the 
   packet transmission time and RTO time-out value sent by the sender.

2.  Conventions and Terminology

2.1.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL","SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [4].

   
2.2 Terminology
   
    TBD


3.  Delayed ack frame 

   The frame type for delayed ack defined in this draft is as follows.
   
       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                  packet transmission time                     |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |          RTO timer value (16) |      
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   
   The frame can be included in the packet that contains non real-time 
   stream with stream id not equal to 0. The receiver can transmit 
   its ack frame by using the conventional way when the received packet 
   does not contain the delayed ack frame. The packet transmission time 
   and its RTO time-out timer value is included in the delayed ack 
   frame. The type for the frame is TBD. How to setup the value for the 
   delayed ack timer is for further study. When the receiver only 
   receives data stream from the sender, then it cannot know the latency 
   between the receiver and the sender. If the receiver can know the 
   latency, then the receiver can precisely adjust the delayed ack timer 
   value. In order to determine the latency between the receiver and the
   sender, receiver transmits the timestamp frame including 
   (1) frame transmission time that is included in the delayed ack,
   (2) frame receive time and (3) frame transmit time that is similar to
   the ICMP timestamp request and reply packet. Then, the sender can
   know the round trip time (RTT) and can send the value to receiver.


4.  Security Considerations

   TBD
