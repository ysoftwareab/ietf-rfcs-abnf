Abstract

   This document describes a protocol extension for the HTTP Enabled
   Location Delivery (HELD) protocol.  It allows a Target to manage
   their location information on a Location Information Server (LIS)
   through the application of constraints invoked by accessing a
   location URI.  Constraints described in this memo restrict how often
   location can be accessed through a location URI, how long the URI is
   valid for, and the type of location information returned when a
   location URI is accessed.  Extension points are also provided.

Internet-Draft                HELD Context                September 2008


1.  Introduction

   The HTTP Enabled Location Delivery (HELD) protocol specification
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery] provides a set of features
   that can be used by a Target to retrieve location information from a
   Location Information Server (LIS).  The basic HELD specification does
   this in a more or less stateless manner, and when a location URI is
   retrieved the Target has no way of controlling how the URI is used; a
   Location Recipient in pocession of the location URI can get the
   Target's location until the URI expires.  This basic mechanism may be
   reasonable in a limited set of applications, but is unacceptable in a
   broader range of applications.  This position is highlighted in
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-lbyr-requirements] which describes requirements for
   constraints relating to location URIs.  This specification provides
   support for these requirements in HELD.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document reuses the terms Target, as defined in [RFC3693].

   This document uses the term Location Information Server (LIS) as the
   node in the access network that provides location information about a
   Target.  This term is also used in [I-D.ietf-geopriv-l7-lcp-ps].

3.  What is a Context?

   A Location URI points to a LIS that is able to provide the location
   of a specific Target.  The LIS is able to map the URI to the location
   of the Target inside its administrative domain.  We call this mapping
   a "context".  In the basic HELD specification the context is
   implicitly created with the request for a location URI in the
   locationRequest message.  The Target has no control of the mapping
   from the URI to the Target's location.  This specification provides a
   degree of control to the Target, allowing it to specify rules to the
   LIS on how a context should map a URI to location information.

   A context expires when it reaches a certain age, at which time the
   mapping between the URI and the Target's location ceases.  In the
   basic HELD specification the exiry time of the context is determined
   by the LIS when the Target requests a location URI.  By allowing the
   Target to specify and change the life time of a context the Target is
   able to create URIs for limited periods, or to terminate URIs for
   which it no longer wishes its location to be returned.  This
   specification provides explicit support for this functionality.

4.  Constraints

   Constraints restrict the ability of a Location Recipient to resolve a
   location URI to location information.  The constraints are selected
   by the Target and they are provided to the LIS that maintains them
   along with the context.  A LIS, understanding this specification,
   receives constraints provided by the Target, and returns a set of
   URIs influenced by the constraints.

   A single Target may want to place different contraints on different
   references and hence may have multiple contexts on the LIS.  The
   constraints describe what actions the LIS MUST take when a URI
   associated with the context is accessed.  This document describes two
   basic constraints that a Target can use in combination for the same
   context.  Once set, these rules remain in force of the life of the
   context.

4.1.  Limited Use URIs

   A limited use URI can only be accessed a fixed number of times to
   yield the location of the Target.  Each time the URI is used to
   provide the location of the Target one usage is consumed.  Once the
   limit is reached the URI no longer yields the location of the Target
   and the URI is deemed spent.

   By setting the usage limit to 1, the Target is able to create a one-
   time-URI permitting a Location Recipient to obtain the Target's
   location only once.  Setting the usage limit to something higher than
   1 creates functionality analogous to a metro-ticket, where a Location
   Recipient in possession of the URI can access the Target's location
   many more times, but not exceeding the imposed limit.

   Not setting a usage limit provides similar semantics to the URI in
   the base HELD specification, enabling a Location Recipient to
   continually obtain the Target's location until the URI expires due to
   age.

   When a HELD URI is assigned to a context, the limit is the number of
   times that the URI can be accessed before the LIS returns an error.
   In the case of SIP or pres URIs it is the number of NOTIFY messages
   that are sent prior to the LIS returning an error.  Where a context
   supports SIP, pres, and HELD URIs it is the combination of URI
   accesses and NOTIFY messages that constitutes the usage value, each
   time the Target's location is provided constitutes a usage.

4.2.  Snapshot URIs

   A snapshot URI points to the location of the Target at a specific
   point in time, and no matter how many times the URI is accessed it
   will always yield the same location.  This is useful if, for example,
   the Target does not want to be tracked.  In this specification the
   location snapshot to which a snapshot URIs points is captured when
   the context is created on the LIS.

5.  Protocol Details

   This specification introduces three new HELD messages, create context
   (<createContext>), update context (<updateContext>), and context
   response (<contextResponse>).  A LIS that does not understand this
   specification is expected to return a HELD _unsupportedMessage_ error
   code in a HELD error message.  A LIS that does understand this
   specification returns errors associated with context operations in a
   HELD error message.  New error codes relating to failed context
   operations are defined in this specification.

   The specification assumes that the LIS was discovered as part of the
   general HELD LIS discovery process.  All messages are sent using the
   application/held+xml MIME type as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery].

5.1.  Create Context Message

   The Target creates a context on the LIS using a create context
   message.  The basic create context message supports the constraints
   described in Section 4 and consist of two attributes and one element
   described below:

   o  "uses": an optional attribute instructing the LIS on how many
      times a URI may yield the location of the Target.  This is a
      positive integer, and has a default value of _unlimited_.  The LIS
      SHOULD support the Target specifying up to at least 100 uses.

   o  "snapshot": an optional attribute instructing the LIS to take a
      snapshot of the Target's location for use with the context.  This
      a boolean value and has a default of _false_ meaning that a
      snapshot is not taken, and the Target's location is determined
      each time the URI is accessed.

   o  "lifeTime": is a mandatory element that defines the maximum period
      in seconds that the LIS should keep the context for.  The LIS MAY
      create the context with a shorter life time than was requested,
      but the life time MUST NOT be longer than was requested.


   <createContext
        xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:context"
        uses="10"
        snapshot="false">
     <lifeTime>7200</lifeTime>
   </createContext>

                      Figure 1: createContext Example

   Figure 1 shows a create context message defining a context which:

   o  may be accessed 10 times

   o  will determine the location of the Target each time it is accessed

   o  will be valid for 2 hours from the time of context creation

5.2.  Update Context Message

   A Target can change the life time of a context using an update
   context message.  As stated in Section 4 the two attributes used in
   the context creation, "uses" and "snapshot" cannot be changed once a
   context is created.

   Since the Target may have more than one context on the LIS, the
   Target needs to identify the context to be updated.  It does this by
   including a context identifier that is provided to it by the LIS when
   the context is created.


   <updateContext
       xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:context"
       id="uhvuhdbnuiehudbnvcujevuijeijcvij3">
     <lifeTime>3600</lifeTime>
   </updateContext>

             Figure 2: updateContext Life Time Change Example

   When a Target includes a life time element in an update context
   message, the LIS needs to calculate a new context expiry time.  The
   LIS MUST do this by adding the new life time value to the current
   time on the LIS.  This mechanism means the Target can terminate a
   context at any time.  It does this by updating the context with a
   life time of 0, which results in the LIS setting the context expiry
   time to the present.  The LIS MAY also terminate a context if the
   life time value is set to less than 10 seconds.


   <updateContext
       xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:context"
       id="uhvuhdbnuiehudbnvcujevuijeijcvij3">
     <lifeTime>0</lifeTime>
   </updateContext>

5.3.  Context Response Message

   The LIS informs the Target about the outcome of context operations
   through the context response message.  The LIS MUST always send a
   context response message to a Target in response to a create context
   or update context message when the outcome was successful.  The
   context response message contains a "code" attribute indicating the
   performed operation, and the other attributes and elements indicating
   the state of the context.

   The "code" attribute is an enumerated type and has one of the
   following values:

   o  _created_: The context was successfully created.

   o  _destroyed_: The context was destroyed.

   o  _updated_: The context was successfully updated.

   The following list details the other attributes that may be returned
   in a context response message.

   id:  The identifier allocated to the context by the LIS.  This
      identifier is unique in the scope of the LIS.  The Target MUST
      keep this secret and MUST included it in all update requests.  The
      LIS MUST return an "id" in all context response messages.

   uses:  The number of times that the context will yield the Target's
      location.  The LIS MAY report either the original value, or the
      number of remaining uses.  The LIS MUST report this value for all
      responses pertaining to a known and valid context.  This value MAY
      be ommitted when indicating that a context has been destroyed.

   snapshot:  The value of the snapshot attribute in the context.  The
      LIS MUST report this value for all responses pertaining to a known
      and valid context.  This value MAY be ommitted when indicating
      that a context has been destroyed.

   expiry:  The time at which the context will expire.  After this time,
      all location URIs that reference this context no longer work.  The
      LIS MUST report this value for all responses pertaining to a known
      context.  This attribute MUST be provided even when a "code" value
      of _destroyed_ is included in the context repsonse message.

   In addition to the above attributes, the LIS also provides a set of
   URIs that can used to access the Target's location with the surety
   that the context constraints will be applied.  A URI set is returned
   whenever a context is successfully created on the LIS, and this set

   remains unchanged for the lifetime of the context.  A context
   response message sent in reply to the create context message in
   Figure 1 might look like Figure 4.


   <contextResponse
             xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:context"
             code="created"
             id="uhvuhdbnuiehudbnvcujevuijeijcvij4"
             uses="10"
             snapshot="false"
             expires="2007-11-01T13:30:00">
       <locationUriSet>
         <locationURI>
            held://lis.example.com:9768/357yc6s64ceyoiuy5ax3o4
         </locationURI>
         <locationURI>
            sips:357yc6s64ceyoiuy5ax3o4@lis.example.com:9769
         </locationURI>
       </locationUriSet>
   </contextResponse>

                     Figure 4: contextResponse Example

5.4.  Context Errors

   When the LIS is unable to perform the requested context operation it
   need to inform the Target of this.  It does this using a held error
   message.  New codes are defined for context operation errors:

   o  _badContextMessage_: The LIS was unable to understand the content
      of the message.  In general this will apply to context messages
      containing extensions that the LIS does not understand.

   o  _unknownContext_: The LIS was unable to find the context.

   o  _updateContextFailed_: The LIS was unable to updated the requested
      context.

   o  _createContextFailed_: The LIS was unable to created the requested
      context.

   A Target implementing this specification MUST accept a any HELD error
   message as a valid response to a create context or update context
   message as a LIS may not understand context messages.  A LIS that
   does understand context messages is expected to return the error
   codes above under the prescribed circumstances.

          code="createContextFailed"
          message="Snapshot is not supported"/>

5.5.  Location URI and Context Identifier Generation Rules

   A primary aim of this specification is to provide a Target a means to
   cancel a location URI so that it can no longer be used to provide its
   location.  To achieve this, a location URI generated as part of a
   context creation needs to be unique with in the scope of the LIS, and
   identify only that context.  If the Target destroys a context and
   subsequently creates a new one, URIs associated the new context MUST
   be different from those generated for the previous context.
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery] and
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-lbyr-requirements] provide guidance on the creation
   and desired characteristcs of a location URI.

   The context identifier provided by the LIS to the Target in the
   context response message MUST be unique and MUST be different from
   the identifier provided in any location URI, and it MUST NOT be
   feasible to determine the context-ID from the location URI.  This
   constraint ensures that possession of a location URI does not
   automatically provide access and control over the internals of the
   context.  It MAY be feasible to determined the location URI knowing
   the context-ID however.

   A context identifier is generated by a LIS to uniquely identify a
   context.  It MUST NOT be feasible for a third-party to easily
   determine a context identifier by knowing the identity of the Target.
   This implies that internal correlation (using a hash-table or
   similar) is the only method that the LIS can use to associate a
   context id with a particular Target.

7.  Security Considerations

   There are several security concerns associated with the details in
   this specification.  The first is to do with the nature of the
   sensitivity of any data passed from the Target to the LIS for
   inclusion in a context.  The second is the ability of the LIS to
   contain the number of contexts that it will permit to exist for a
   given Target address.  Finally, there is a threat of Targets
   performing DoS attacks on the LIS by trying to create large numbers
   of short-lived contexts that result in the LIS expending resources in
   message processing.

   HELD [I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery] mandates the use of
   TLS for exchanges between a Target and the LIS.  This is deemed
   adequate to provide confidentiality to any contextual data in
   transit.  The LIS implementation and the operator of the LIS need to
   take sufficient steps to ensure that active contextual data on the
   LIS is not readily available to anyone other than the Target.  The
   Target MUST NOT provide any information to the LIS that it does not
   want the LIS to know or be able to use in some capacity associated
   with determination or providing of the Target's location.

   It is quite conceivable that a LIS will be required to provide
   location to Targets residing behind a NAT; a DSL home router with 5
   PCs attached is a good example this situation.  In this case it is
   reasonable for each device to create its own context on the LIS, and
   for the LIS to treat each context individually even though the LIS
   cannot make any other distinction between the end hosts; that is,
   they share a common IP address/identity from the LIS perspective.

   Given the constraints that can be added to a context and the way that
   a Target might want to manage expiry separately, a Target may use
   multiple contexts as a way to isolate applications from each other.
   For instance, a Target can create a context for each application so
   that it can revoke access to its location information for each
   without affecting other applications' access.  This environment,
   however, opens the LIS to a type of denial of service attack through
   an overload of contexts.  It is RECOMMENDED that an implementer of
   this specification include mechanisms to restrict to the maximum
   number of contexts that can be created on the LIS by an individual
   Target.

   Using short-term location URIs in a carefully controlled manner may
   obviate the need for individual location authorization policies on
   the LIS.  This leads to reduced LIS complexity and the amount of
   private information that the Target need share with the LIS.  This
   specification provides the ability for a Target to cancel a location
   URI which extends the Target's ability to enforce its entitlement to

   privacy.  Using the mechanisms described in this memo a target can
   create URIs with short validity periods; this restricts how long a
   third-party is able to obtain the location of the Target while still
   allowing the Target the convenience of using a location reference.

   The generation of context identifiers by the LIS is a critical
   component to supporting the functionality described in this memo.
   The LIS MUST follow the rules described in Section 5.5 for generating
   context identifiers.

Appendix A.  Context Extensions

   A context contains specific information about a Target and is stored
   on the LIS.  As with other protocols it is necessary to consider
   extensibility.  When defining context data extensions it is necessary
   to consider how they will be used; this includes not only how to
   provide the information from the Target to the LIS, but also
   acceptance and error indications from the LIS back to the Target.
   For example, a context may be created with several extensions
   included, how does the LIS indicate that extensions 1 and 3 were
   successful but that extension 2 had a problem in its formatting?
   Guidelines for designing context extensions that provide
   functionality are described below.

   Two basic types of context data extension are envisioned.  The first
   consist of data provided by the Target to be consumed by the LIS; for
   example information pertaining to PIDF-LO construction, usage-rules,
   and authorization policies.  The second type of data consists of a
   two way exchange between the Target and the LIS; for example
   exchanging location determination capabilities.  Extensibility to the
   context scheme is to allow additional elements to be added to the
   context easily.  The general idea is shown in Figure 7.

   </hc:createContext>

                 Figure 7: Create Context with Extensions

   When defining a context data extension it is necessary to ensure that
   the LIS can provide an adequate response to the Target indicating
   acceptance or rejection of the data provided.  This may be an
   explicit OK or FAIL message within the extension namespace, it may be
   an attribute associated with part of a larger data exchange, or it
   may result in the LIS failing to create the context at all.
   Regardless, it is mandatory for a context data extension to provide

                  Figure 8: LIS response to createContext

   When defining information to be included in a context data extension
   consideration should be given to how that data can be removed from
   the context.  In some cases it may be necessary to void the context
   on the LIS in order to remove information, but this SHOULD be treated
   as a last resort and not used as the primary mechanism for removing
   data from the context.

Appendix B.  HELD Compliance to IETF Location Configuration Protocol
             Location Reference Requirements

   This section describes how HELD and this specification comply to the
   LCP location reference requirements stipulated in
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-lbyr-requirements].

   High-level requirements for a location configuration protocol.

   C1.  "Location URI support - LCP: The configuration protocol MUST
        support a location reference in URI form."


        COMPLY.  HELD only provides location references in URI form.


   C2.  "Location URI expiration: The LCP MUST support the ability to
        specify to the server, the length of time that a location URI
        will be valid."


        COMPLY.  HELD with the context management extensions described
        in this document provide the Target the ability to specify
        expiry times for location URIs.


   C3.  "Location URI cancellation: The LCP MUST support the ability to
        request a cancellation of a specific location URI."


        COMPLY.  HELD with the context management extensions described
        in this document provide the Target the ability to void location
        URIs when required.


   C4.  "Random Generated: The location URI MUST be hard to guess, i.e.,
        it MUST contain a cryptographically random component."


        COMPLY.  The HELD specification and this document provide
        specific guidance on the security surrounding location URI
        generation.


   C5.  "Identity Protection - LCP: The location URI MUST NOT contain
        any information that identifies the user, device or address of
        record within the URI form."

Internet-Draft                HELD Context                September 2008


        COMPLY.  The HELD specification and this document provide
        specific guidance on the anonymity of the Target with regards to
        the generation of location URIs.


   C6.  "Reuse flag default: The LCP MUST support the default condition
        of a requested location URI being repeatedly reused."


        COMPLY.  HELD with the context management extensions described
        in this document provide the Target the ability to specify how
        many times a location URI may yield the location of Target.


   C7.  "One-time-use: The LCP MUST support the ability for the client
        to request a 'one-time-use' location URI (e.g., via a reuse flag
        setting)."


        COMPLY.  HELD with the context management extensions described
        in this document provide the Target the ability to specify how
        many times a location URI may yield the location of Target.
        This value may be set to 1 to create a one-time URI.
