1. Abstract

This document proposes the definition of an application/QSIG media type, 
according to the rules defined in RFC 2048 [1].

2. Introduction

The QSIG family of standards provides connectivity between corporate network 
switches, Centrex switches as well as corporate network to Centrex switches. 
Qsig standards also specifies a set of supplementary services, the service 
specific "QSIG" signalling protocols for the exchange of information between 
switches across an interface at the "Q" reference point.

QSIG basic call is essentially a symmetrical (peer-to-peer) version of ISDN 
DSS1. QSIG also adds generic procedures for the support of supplementary 
services. These procedures allow for standardized and proprietary 
supplementary services to coexist in a graceful manner. There is a need to 
transport QSIG messages between MGCs as part of the payload of SIP [2] 
messages. The following discussion is specific to this usage and would not 
apply to the transportation of QSIG messages in other applications.

3. The application/QSIG media type

The QSIG messages are composed of arbitrary binary data. The proposed way to 
encode these is to use binary encoding. This is in conformance with the 
restrictions imposed on the use of binary data for MIME (RFC 2045 [3]). It 
should be noted that the rules mentioned in the RFC 2045 apply to Internet 

draft-ong-sip-qsig-mime-00                                                  1
Internet Draft                QSIG MIME Type                 October 20, 1999

mail messages and not to SIP messages. This approach is consistent with 
encoding of ISUP signalling over SIP.

The application/QSIG media type is defined by the following information:

Media type name: application
Media subtype name: QSIG
Required parameters: none
Optional parameters: version
Encoding scheme: binary
Security considerations: See section 5.


The use of the 'version' parameter allows differentiation between different 
QSIG variants. 


This enables the terminating Connection Server to recognize and parse the 
message correctly, or (possibly) to reject the message if the  particular 
QSIG variant is not supported. The idea here is to allow to specify a 
preference of version, so that the following scenarios are possible: "I 
only like application/QSIG;version=ISO" or "I accept application/QSIG 
(but don't really know the details; I just pass them on to some other tool 
that displays/munges them)". 

The following is how a typical header would look:-

        Content-Type: application/QSIG; Version: ISO
        Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary

Table 1 is a partial list of protocol versions supported by the 
'application/QSIG' media type.

        Version         Protocol
        -------         --------
        ISO             ISO/IEC 11572


4. Illustrative example

SIP message format requires a Request line followed by Header lines followed 
by a CRLF separator followed by the message body. To illustrate the use of 
the 'application/QSIG' media type, below is an INVITE message which has the 
originating SDP information and an encapsulated QSIG SETUP message.


Note that the two payloads are demarcated by the boundary parameter 
(specified in RFC 2046 [4]) which in the example has the value "unique-
boundary-1". This is part of the specification of MIME multipart and is 
not related to the 'application/QSIG' media type.

5. Security considerations

The security mechanisms described in RFC 2543 (SIP - Session Initiation 
Protocol) should suffice. No new security considerations are necessary.
