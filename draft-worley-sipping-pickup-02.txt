Abstract

   This document walks through various examples and call flows for
   implementing "call pickup" operations in SIP telephony.  It focuses
   on distributing as much processing as possible in the user agents in
   accordance with the philosophy of end-point controlled call-control
   (EPCC).

   Various difficulties in implementing call pickup are discussed, and
   further suggestions and discussion are solicited.

Internet-Draft         Call Pickup Examples in SIP             June 2006


1.  Introduction

   There are several different schemes for implementing call pickup.
   The basic method is the one specified in the Sylantro "SIP-B"
   specification, which despite its proprietary air, uses standard SIP
   features in an end-point call control (EPCC) style [1].  All other
   methods are variations on the same theme, usually by using an agent
   process (in a proxy or communications server) to provide a feature
   that the user agents are lacking.  Almost all the software
   development effort to support call pickup is in implementing these
   agent processes, so we can easily see the trade-off between
   development effort and which features must be provided by the user
   agents.

   Like call transfer, effecting call pickup requires some support from
   the caller's end.  These caller-end features will, therefore, soon
   come to be considered necessary for any "quality" SIP implementation.

   This document shows message flows for executing call pickup using
   various configurations of SIP agents, including a proxy that
   dispatches requests for AORs to their registered UAs, "call state
   agents" that generate dialog events on behalf of UAs that cannot
   generate them, and "pickup agents" that execute the call pickup
   sequence on behalf of UAs that cannot do so themselves.  It also
   discusses various complications that can arise.

   This document is not intended to advance toward standardization, but
   rather to server as examples for implementors, and to start
   discussion of problems in SIP that may arise when implementing call
   pickup.

2.  Related work

   Several other documents have explored SIP call pickup:

   1.  draft-ietf-sipping-service-examples [2] discusses a large number
       of EPCC implementations of call-control features, including
       implementations of call pickup operations.

   2.  draft-procter-sipping-call-park-extension [3] discusses an
       alternative mechanism to park calls with designated, short
       parking orbit numbers, and how to retrieve such calls.

3.  Basic call flow

   The SIP-B pickup mechanism is implemented in the user agents.  Thus,
   it requires a more sophisticated user agent to execute the pickup.
   It also depends on the callee phone producing dialog events, or there
   being a state agent doing so on its behalf.

   The basic SIP-B pickup sequences is as follows.  (Only principal
   messages are shown.)  Suppose the incoming call is to the callee
   phone, extension 123, and the phone executing the pickup is extension
   456:

   Caller                 Callee             Executing
                            123                 456

     |                       |                   |
     |   1 INVITE            |                   |
     |---------------------->|                   |
     |                       |                   |
     |                       |                   |   2 Call Pickup
     |                       |                   |     on 123
     |                       |                   |
     |                       |   3 SUBSCRIBE     |
     |                       |<------------------|
     |                       |                   |
     |                       |   4 NOTIFY        |
     |                       |------------------>|
     |                       |                   |
     |   5 INVITE/Replaces   |                   |
     |<------------------------------------------|
     |                       |                   |
     |   6 CANCEL            |                   |
     |---------------------->|                   |
     |                       |                   |
     |   7 200 OK            |                   |
     |------------------------------------------>|
     |                       |                   |
     |                       |                   |

   1. The caller (AOR Caller@example.com) sends an INVITE with URI
      123@example.com to phone 123.

   2. The user of phone 456 activates the call pickup feature for
      extension 123.

   3. Phone 456 sends a SUBSCRIBE with URI 123@example.com to phone 123,
      requesting "Event: dialog" and "Expires: 0".

   4. Phone 123 sends one NOTIFY to phone 456 giving the status of its
      current dialogs for AOR 123@example.com, which includes the early
      dialog of INVITE 1 from Caller, and gives the "remote identity"
      and "remote target" of the dialog (which are the From: and
      Contact: of INVITE 1), one of which is "Caller@example.com".

   5. Phone 456 sends INVITE 5 to Caller@example.com.  It has a
      Replaces: header specifying the dialog parameters sent in the
      NOTIFY.  The Replaces: header contains the "early-only" option, so
      that the pickup operation fails if extension 123 answers the call.

   6. As a consequence of executing the INVITE/Replaces, the caller
      sends a CANCEL of its INVITE 1 to phone 123.

   7. The caller sends a 200 response to the INVITE 5 from phone 456.

      At this point, Caller is talking to phone 456.

4.  Detailed call flow

   A more complete packet diagram of a SIP-B pickup sequence is as
   follows. (100 responses are present only if the transport is UDP, and
   are omitted on this diagram.)  Messages in the same transaction are
   labeled with the same number but successive letters, e.g., 7a, 7b,
   7c.

   1. The caller (AOR Caller@example.com) sends an INVITE 1a with URI
      123@example.com to phone 123.

   2. The user of phone 456 activates the call pickup feature for
      extension 123.  This may be activated by a special button on the
      phone, or through a dialing prefix which is intercepted by the
      phone.

   3. Phone 456 sends a SUBSCRIBE 3a with URI 123@example.com to
      extension 123, requesting "Event: dialog" and "Expires: 0".  This
      SUBSCRIBE requests one NOTIFY containing the status of all dialogs
      involving AOR 123@example.com.

      This requires that the other phones in the installation can
      produce dialog event notifications.  We discuss below using a
      state agent to support phones that cannot produce dialog event
      notifications.

      Since dialog event notifications can contain sensitive
      information, the ability to SUBSCRIBE to them should be controlled
      by authentication.  This will be discussed below.

   4. Phone 123 sends one NOTIFY 4a to phone 456 giving the status of
      its current dialogs for AOR 123@example.com, which includes the
      early dialog of INVITE 1a from Caller, and gives the "remote
      identity" and/or "remote target" of the dialog (which are the
      From: and Contact: of INVITE 1a), which is "Caller@example.com".

   5. Phone 456 sends to Caller@example.com an INVITE 5a.  It has a
      Replaces: header specifying the dialog parameters sent in NOTIFY
      4a.  Its URI is the remote target address, and its has a Replaces:
      header specifying the dialog parameters sent in the NOTIFY.

      If the NOTIFY 4a does not include a "remote target" URI (which
      should always identify the caller UA), the executing phone will
      have to fall back to the "remote identity" URI (in hopes that it
      routes to the caller UA).  The "remote target" URI should be the
      Contact URI from INVITE 1a.  In order for INVITE 5a to succeed,
      that Contact needs to be globally routable.

   1c. The caller sends a CANCEL 1c of its INVITE 1a to phone 123.

   1d. The caller sends a 200 response to the INVITE 5a from phone 456.

      At this point, Caller is talking to phone 456.

   The major differences from the previous example are:

   1. INVITE 1a and later messages in its transaction go through the
      proxy, thus allowing the proxy to convert 123@example.com to a
      series of contact points.

   3. SUBSCRIBE 3a also goes through the proxy, so it is also sent to a
      series of contact points.  The proxy should fork the SUBSCRIBE in
      the same way as it would fork an INVITE, except that it should
      fork all the contact points in parallel, even if they would fork
      serially for INVITEs, so phone 456 cab find its target call
      quickly.

      As SUBSCRIBE 3a is forked, its request URI is changed from the AOR
      123@example.com to various contact URIs, usually the same user
      name with host parts that are the IP addresses of the phone user
      agents.  This will match the request URIs of the INVITEs 1b, so
      information about those dialogs will be reported in NOTIFYs.

   4. Because SUBSCRIBE 3a can be forked, phone 456 should be prepared
      to receive multiple NOTIFYs from various phones for AOR 123, and
      be able to select the correct dialog if it discovers more than
      one.

      Phone 456 should beware that it may see multiple instances of a
      single forked INVITE (which have the same Call-Id), and not
      present them to the user as alternatives.

      Phone 456 should beware that one AOR might be forwarded to a URI
      with a different user name.  E.g., "123@example.com" might fork
      first to an user agent on 123's desk ("123@10.1.200.12") and then
      to a back-up responder ("789@example.com").  However, a UA that
      receives SUBSCRIBE 3a will see the same request URI as it saw when

      it received INVITE 1a, and thus will include any dialog it creates
      in its subsequent NOTIFY 4a.  But it may include dialogs that were
      originally sent to other AORs as well.  Unfortunately, there is no
      clean way to distinguish the dialogs that were originally for 123,
      as the best approximation to that information is the "local
      identity" (i.e., "To:" URI), but that may have originally been an
      address that forwards to 123.  In the end, we should avoid to
      forwarding two AORs to the same request-URI, so as to avoid this
      ambiguity.

   5. The INVITE/Replaces 5a may be forwarded through the proxy as well.
      Doing so makes no essential difference to the operation.

6.  Call pickup with proxy and state agent

   This case is when the phones themselves cannot generate dialog event
   notices, so that work is delegated to a state agent which receives
   information from the site's proxy.

      The proxy monitors the progress of dialogs and reports state
      information via a possibly non-SIP channel to the state agent.
      Since the state agent needs to report only early dialog
      information, one possible channel is to do a non-blocking fork to
      the state agent of every call to 123.  (This trick was invented by
      Scott Lawrence.)  However, if the state agent will be used to
      support applications that require knowledge of committed dialogs
      (e.g., attendant consoles), this technique alone will not be
      sufficient.

   3. The proxy routes SUBSCRIBE 3a not to phone 123 but rather to the
      state agent.  The state agent uses the request URI or the From:
      URI to determine the user on whose behalf it should generate
      events.

      Since a SIP call can be maintained indefinitely without any
      signaling, it is possible for the state agent to miss the
      termination of a call and believe that the call is continuing
      forever.  There needs to be a way to clear such state.  Early
      dialog state can be cleared due to the global time limit on INVITE
      transactions, but committed dialogs have no intrinsic time limit.
      One way to reset the state agent would be to define a dialing
      prefix, and any call to an extension prepended with the dialing
      prefix would be routed to the state agent, which would interpret
      the INVITE as a request to reset the state of the specified
      extension.

7.  Call pickup with a pickup agent

   A further case allows calls to be picked up by phones that do not
   implement SIP-B pickup.  Essentially, the phone makes a call that is
   routed to a "pickup agent" which executes the SIP-B pickup process on
   the phone's behalf.

   2. The executing user dials a special prefix and then the extension
      from which the call is to be picked up.

   3. Because the dialed number starts with the pickup prefix "*78", the
      call is routed (either by a phone dialplan or an outgoing call
      proxy) to the pickup agent.

   4 and 5. The pickup agent executes the same sequence of actions as a
      SIP-B phone would.

   3b. After determining the Caller's URI, the pickup agent appends a
      Replaces: header to the INVITE and forwards it as if it was
      proxying the call.

      If the target phone is represented by a state agent, then the
      pickup agent and the state agent could communicate by non-SIP
      means rather than using SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY.

8.  With improved pickup agent

   The previous packet flow is suboptimal in that the pickup agent acts
   as a non-standard proxy, rewriting an INVITE into an INVITE with
   Replaces: header.  We can adopt a technique from Dan Petrie to be
   strictly conformant: The pickup agent returns a 302 (Moved
   Temporarily) response to the executing phone, bearing a Contact:
   header with a URI <caller-URI?Replaces=dialog-parameters>.

   The major differences in processing are:

   3. Instead of forwarding the INVITE to the Caller, the pickup agent
      returns a 302 response, whose Contact is a URI for the Caller with
      a Replaces header parameter specifying dialog 1a.  Phone 456 then
      sends INVITE/Replaces 4a to Caller.

9.  With proxy and improved pickup agent

   Let's combine some of the above flows to show a realistic case, where
   all signaling goes through the proxy, and we use the "improved"
   pickup agent to support a phone that does not do call pickup by
   itself.

   The overall call flow is:

   1. Caller sends invite to the target (123).

   2. Executing phone (456) dials *78123.

   3. Due to the dialing prefix, the INVITE is routed to the pickup
      agent.

   4. The pickup agent recognizes the dialing prefix *78 and puts the
      transaction aside for a moment.  It initiates a SUBSCRIBE with
      "Expires:0" (one-time) to 123.

   5. The target sends a NOTIFY back to the pickup agent.

   3d. The pickup agent selects dialog 1 to be picked up, and returns a
      302 for INVITE 3b to the proxy.  The 302 contains "Contact:
      <caller-URI?Replaces=dialog-1-parameters>".

   3e. The proxy starts another fork of INVITE 3a, sending an INVITE 3e
      with Replaces header to the Caller.  INVITE 3e is accepted,
      replacing the dialog initiated by INVITE 1a.  Caller then sends
      CANCEL 1e for INVITE 1a, leading to a 200 OK response for the
      CANCEL and a 487 response for INVITE 1a, as well as an ACK for the
      487 response.

10.  Group call pickup

   There are three kinds of group call pickup:

10.1.  Picking up any call to any member of a group of individuals

   This is a pickup directed to "any call to any of the people in my
   group", that is, being able to pick up a call without having to first
   determine the specific extension to which it was directed.

   If the proxy is configured to provide a URI that forwards to all
   members of the group, a SUBSCRIBE to that URI will be forwarded to
   all of the relevant user agents.  However, no incoming call contains
   the group URI as part of its dialog identification, so it becomes
   questionable how the executing phone determines that it can pickup
   the call.

   The common convention is that a pickup that has several possible
   targets should pick up the call that has been waiting longest.  The
   dialog event package contains a "duration" parameter.

10.2.  Picking up a call routed to several individuals

   In terms of the old key phone systems, this situation is like an
   extension number that rings on several people's multi-line phones.

   This can be handled without additional work, because the proxy will
   already be routing this URI to all of the individuals' user agents,
   and so it will route a SUBSCRIBE to that URI to all of the user
   agents as well, ensuring that the executing phone will see
   information about the incoming call.

10.3.  Picking up a call that is not routed to a specific user agent

   This is the situation of a call when the caller dials a number that
   is not immediately routed to any particular phone, but rather "rings
   in limbo" until someone picks it up.  In SIP, this service is
   implemented via an intangible user agent for the AOR that is the
   endpoint of an early dialog, but never answers it.

   Call pickup from this sort of "calling group" is very similar to call
   pickup from a phone or individual line, as long as the intangible UA
   implements the needed SIP features to participate in a call pickup.

11.  Call park

   Retrieving a call from call parking is very much like call pickup of
   a ringing call.

   To park a call, the phone transfers it to an extension that is
   maintained by a "park server", a multi-line software UA that accepts
   and maintains dialogs to a set of extensions that are defined as
   "parking orbits".

   To retrieve a parked call, a phone executes a call pickup operation,
   except that the parameters of the Replaces header do not include the
   "early-only" operation, so that the confirmed dialog with the park
   server can be retrieved.

   When call pickup and call retrieve are implemented by a pickup agent,
   the pickup agent is the only component that needs to distinguish the
   parking orbits and generate the Replaces header specification in its
   302 response differently.

12.  Alternative retrieval mechanism for call park

   Section 11 envisions that calls are retrieved from parking much like
   ringing calls are picked up, which requires that the park server can
   respond to SUBSCRIBE requests for the dialog event package.  To avoid
   this requirement, call retrieval can be implemented by sending the
   INVITE for call retrieval directly to the park server, which will
   itself determine the call to be retrieved.  The park server can put
   the Executor in contact with the Caller by accepting the INVITE and
   then executing a "consultative transfer" operation, sending a 302
   response, or other techniques.

   This technique can reduce the number of SIP features that the park
   server needs to support, at the expense of implementing more
   application-level processing.

   1. We start at the point where Caller has a dialog established with
      the park server on parking orbit 123.

   2. The user of phone 456 activates the call pickup feature for
      extension 123.  This may be activated by a special button on the
      phone, or through a dialing prefix which is intercepted by the
      phone.  In this example, the user dials "*78123".

   3. The INVITE to *78123 is routed to the park server.

      The park server determines that it has a dialog established on
      parking orbit 123, and extracts the dialog's identifiers.  The
      park server sends a 302 (Moved Temporarily) response, with a
      Contact header that specifies the Caller's contact URI, and
      provides a header parameter for a Replaces header specifying the
      dialog identifiers for the call on orbit 123.

   4. Due to the 302 response, UA 456 sends an INVITE with a Replaces
      header to Caller.  Caller accepts the INVITE and replaces dialog 1
      with it.

   5. Caller terminates the dialog with the park server.

13.  Security considerations

   All of these mechanisms (with the exception of using an integrated
   state agent and pickup agent) depend on SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY for the
   dialog event package.  But SUBSCRIBE reveals information which could
   be sensitive -- we have just shown that anyone who can successfully
   SUBSCRIBE to an extension can take calls from that extension!

   Thus, we need to ensure that the acceptance of SUBSCRIBEs is
   controlled by suitable security mechanisms.
