1.  Introduction

   Service Function Chaining [I-D.ietf-sfc-architecture] provides a
   flexible way to construct services.  When applying a particular
   Service Function Chain (SFC) to the traffic classified by the
   Classifier, the traffic needs to be steered through an ordered set of
   Service Functions (SF) in the network.  This ordered set of SFs in
   the network, referred to as a Service Function Path (SFP), is an
   instantiation of the SFC in the network.  For example, as shown in
   Figure 1, an SFP corresponding to the SFC of {SF1, SF3} can be
   expressed as {SFF1, SF1, SFF2, SF3}.

             Figure 1: PCE-based Service Function Chaining in SR Network

   [I-D.xu-spring-pce-based-sfc-arch] describes a PCE-based SFC
   architecture in which the PCE is used to compute an SFP (i.e.,
   instantiate a service function chain) in SPRING networks (a.k.a.,
   Segment Routing networks or SR networks in short).  This document
   describes extensions to the PCEP on basis of that architecture.  The
   extensions specified in this document are applicable to both the
   stateless PCE model defined in [RFC5440] and the stateful PCE model
   defined in [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce].

2.  Terminology

   This section contains definitions for terms used frequently
   throughout this document.  However, many additional definitions can
   be found in [RFC5440], [I-D.sivabalan-pce-segment-routing] and
   [I-D.xu-spring-pce-based-sfc-arch].

      PCC: Path Computation Client

      PCE: Path Computation Element

      PCEP: Path Computation Element Protocol

      ERO: Explicit Route Object

      Service Function Chain (SFC): A service function chain defines an
      ordered set of abstract service functions (SFs) and ordering
      constraints that must be applied to packets and/or frames and/or
      flows selected as a result of classification.

      SF Identifier (SF ID): A unique identifier that represents a
      service function within an SFC-enabled domain.

      Service Function Forwarder (SFF): A service function forwarder is
      responsible for forwarding traffic to one or more connected
      service functions according to information carried in the SFC
      encapsulation, as well as handling traffic coming back from the
      SF.

      Service Function Path (SFP): The Service Function Path is a
      constrained specification of where packets assigned to a certain
      service function path must go.  Specifically, it is an ordered
      list of SFFs and SF IDs.

      Compact SFP: An ordered list of SFFs.

      SID: Segment Identifier

      Service Function SID : A locally unique SID indicating a
      particular service function on an SFF.

      SR: Segment Routing

      SR-specific SFP: An ordered list of node SIDs (representing SFFs)
      and Service Function SIDs.

      Compact SR-specific SFP: An ordered list of node SIDs
      (representing SFFs).

3.  Overview of PCEP Extensions for SFC in SPRING Networks

   As discussed in [I-D.xu-spring-pce-based-sfc-arch], the PCC provides
   an ordered list of SF IDs to the PCE and indicates to the PCE that
   what type SFs and paths are requested (e.g., an SFP, or a compact
   SFP, or an SR-specific SFP, or a compact SR-specific SFP) through the
   path computation request message, and then the PCE responds with a
   corresponding path through the path computation response message.
   This specification is applicable to both stateful and stateless PCEs.

4.  PCEP Message Extensions for SR-based SFC

4.1.  PCReq Message

   This document does not specify any changes to the PCReq message
   format.  This document requires the PATH-SETUP-TYPE TLV
   [I-D.sivabalan-pce-lsp-setup-type] to be carried in the RP Object in
   order for a PCC to request a particular type of path.  Four new Path
   Setup Types need to be defined for SR-based SFC, or SR-SFC in short
   (Section 5.2).  This document also requires the Include Route Object
   (IRO) to be carried in the PCReq message in order for a PCC to
   specify SFC.  A new IRO sub-object type needs to be defined for SF
   (Section 5.3).

4.2.  PCRep Message

   This document defines the format of the PCRep message carrying an
   SFP.  The message is sent by a PCE to a PCC in response to a
   previously received PCReq message, where the PCC requested an SFP.
   The format of the SFC-specific PCRep message is as follows:

              <PCRep Message>::=<Common Header>
                                <response-list>

              Where:

               <response-list>::=<response>[<response-list>]

               <response>::=<RP>
                            [<NO-PATH>]
                            [<path-list>]


               Where:

                <path-list>::=<SR-SFC-ERO>[<path-list>]

Internet-Draft    PCEP Extensions for SPRING-based SFC       August 2015


   The RP and NO-PATH Objects are defined in [RFC5440].  The <SR-SFC-
   ERO> object contains the SFP and is defined in Section 5.4.

4.3.  PCUpd Message

   This document defines the format of the PCUpd message carrying an SFP
   update.  The message is sent forwardly by a PCE to a PCC to update an
   previously computed SFP.

   The format of the PCUpd message is as follows:

           <PCUpd Message>::=<Common Header>
                             <udpate-request-list>

           Where:

            <udpate-request-list>::=<udpate-request>[<udpate-request-list>]

            <udpate-request>::=<SRP><path-list>


            Where:

             <path-list>::=<SR-SFC-ERO>[<path-list>]

4.4.  PCRpt Message

   PCPRpt message sent from a PCC to PCE as a respond to a PCUpd message
   or in an unsolicited manner (e.g., during state synchronization).

   The format of the PCUpd message is as follows:

              <PCUpd Message>::=<Common Header>
                                <state-report-list>

              Where:

               <state-report-list>::=<state-report>[<state-report-list>]

               <state-report>::=[<SRP>]<path-list>


               Where:

                <path-list>::=<SR-SFC-ERO>[<path-list>]

5.  Object Formats

5.1.  OPEN Object

   This document defines a new optional TLV for use in the OPEN Object.

5.1.1.  SR-SFC PCE Capability TLV

   The SR-SFC-PCE-CAPABILITY TLV is an optional TLV for use in the OPEN
   Object to negotiate SR-SFC capability on the PCEP session.  The
   format of the SR-SFC-PCE-CAPABILITY TLV is shown in the following
   Figure 2:

     0                   1                   2                   3
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |         Type=TBD              |       Length=4                |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |          Reserved             |  Flags        |      MSD      |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

               Figure 2: SR-SFC-PCE-CAPABILITY TLV format

   The code point for the TLV type is to be defined by IANA.  The TLV
   length is 4 octets.  The 32-bit value is formatted as follows.  The
   "Maximum SID Depth" (1 octet) field (MSD) specifies the maximum
   number of SIDs that a PCC is capable of imposing on a packet.  The
   "Flags" (1 octet) and "Reserved" (2 octets) fields are currently
   unused, and MUST be set to zero and ignored on receipt.

5.1.1.1.  Negotiating SR-SFC Capability

   The SR-SFC capability TLV is contained in the OPEN object.  By
   including the TLV in the OPEN message to a PCE, a PCC indicates its
   support for SFPs.  By including the TLV in the OPEN message to a PCC,
   a PCE indicates that it is capable of computing SFPs.

5.2.  RP/SRP Object

   In order to setup an SFP, the RP or SRP object MUST carry a PATH-
   SETUP-TYPE TLV specified in [I-D.sivabalan-pce-lsp-setup-type].  This
   document defines four new Path Setup Types (PST) for SR-SFC as
   follows:

      PST = 2: The path is an SFP.

      PST = 3: The path is a compact SFP.

Internet-Draft    PCEP Extensions for SPRING-based SFC       August 2015


      PST = 4: The path is an SR-specific SFP.

      PST = 5: The path is a compact SR-specific SFP.

5.3.  Include Route Object

   The IRO (Include Route Object) MUST be carried within PCReq messages
   to indicate a particular SFC.  Furthermore, the IRO MAY be carried in
   PCRep messages.  When carried within a PCRep message with the NO-PATH
   object, the IRO indicates the set of service functions that cause the
   PCE to fail to find a path.

   This document defines a new sub-object type for the SR-SFC as
   follows:

    Type       Sub-object

    5          Service Function ID

5.4.  SR-SFC-ERO Object

   Generally speaking, an SR-SFC-ERO object consists of one or more ERO
   subobjects described in the following sub-sections to represent a
   particular type of service function path.  In the ERO subobject, each
   SID is associated with an identifier that represents either a service
   node or a service function.  This identifier is referred to as the
   'Node or Service Identifier' (NSI).  As described later, an NSI can
   be represented in various formats (e.g., IPv4 address, IPv6 address,
   SF identifier, etc).  Specifically, in the SFP case, the NSI of every
   ERO subobject contained in the SR-SFC-ERO object represents a service
   node or a service function while the SID of each ERO subobject is set
   to null.  In the compact SFP case, the NSI of every ERO subobject
   contained in the SR-SFC-ERO object only represents an SFF meanwhile
   the SID of every ERO subobject is set to null.  In the SR-specific
   SFP, the NSI of every ERO subobject contained in the SR-SFC-ERO
   object represents an SFF or a service function while the SID of every
   ERO subject MUST NOT be null.  In the compact SR-specific SFP, the
   NSI of every ERO subobject contained in the SR-SFC-ERO object
   represents an SFF meanwhile the SID of every ERO subobject MUST NOT
   be null.

5.4.1.  SR-SFC-ERO Subobject

   An SR-SFC-ERO subobject (as shown in Figure 3) consists of a 32-bit
   header followed by the SID and the NSI associated with the SID.  The
   SID is a 32-bit or 128 bit number.  The size of the NSI depends on
   its respective type, as described in the following sub-sections.

               Figure 3: SR-SFC-ERO Subobject Format

   The fields in the ERO Subobject are as follows:

      'L' Flag: indicates whether the subobject represents a loose-hop
      in the explicit route [RFC3209].  If this flag is unset, a PCC
      MUST not overwrite the SID value present in the SR-SFC-ERO
      subobject.  Otherwise, a PCC MAY expand or replace one or more SID
      value(s) in the received SR-SFC-ERO based on its local policy.

      Type: is the type of the SR-SFC-ERO Subobject.  This document
      defines the SR-SFC-ERO Subobject type.  A new code point will be
      requested for the SR-SFC-ERO Subobject from IANA.

      Length: contains the total length of the subobject in octets,
      including the L, Type and Length fields.  Length MUST be at least
      4, and MUST be a multiple of 4.

      NSI Type (NSIT): indicates the type of NSI associated with the
      SID.  The NSI-Type values are described later in this document.

      Flags: is used to carry any additional information pertaining to
      SID.  Currently, the following flag bits are defined:

         M: When this bit is set, the SID value represents an MPLS label
         stack entry as specified in [RFC5462], where only the label
         value is specified by the PCE.  Other fields (TC, S, and TTL)
         fields MUST be considered invalid, and PCC MUST set these
         fields according to its local policy and MPLS forwarding rules.

         C: When this bit as well as the M bit are set, then the SID
         value represents an MPLS label stack entry as specified in
         [RFC5462], where all the entry's fields (Label, TC, S, and TTL)
         are specified by the PCE.  However, a PCC MAY choose to
         override TC, S, and TTL values according its local policy and
         MPLS forwarding rules.

         S: When this bit is set, the SID value in the subobject body is
         null.  In this case, the PCC is responsible for choosing the
         SID value, e.g., by looking up its Traffic Engineering Database
         (TED) using node/service identifier in the subobject body.

         F: When this bit is set, the NSI value in the subobject body is
         null.

         P: When this bit is set, the SID value represents an IPv6
         address.

      SID: is the 4-octect or 16-octect Segment Identifier

      NSI: contains the NSI associated with the SID.  Depending on the
      value of NSIT, the NSI can have different format as described in
      the following sub-section.

5.4.2.  NSI Associated with SID

   This document defines the following NSIs:

      'IPv4 Node ID': is specified as an IPv4 address.  In this case,
      NSIT and Length are 1 and 12 respectively.

      'IPv6 Node ID': is specified as an IPv6 address.  In this case,
      NSIT and Length are 2 and 24 respectively.

      'Service Function ID': is specified as an SF ID.  In this case,
      NSIT and Length are TBD.

5.4.3.  SR-SFC-ERO Processing

   TBD.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  PCEP Objects

   IANA is requested to allocate an ERO subobject type (recommended
   value= 6) for the SR-SFC-ERO subobject.

6.2.  PCEP-Error Object

   TBD.

6.3.  PCEP TLV Type Indicators

   This document defines the following new PCEP TLVs:

    Value     Meaning                  Reference

    27        SR-SFC-PCE-CAPABILITY    This document

6.4.  New Path Setup Type

   This document defines a new setup type for the PATH-SETUP-TYPE TLV as
   follows:

     Value   Description                             Reference

     2       The path is an SFP.                     This document

     3       The path is a compact SFP.              This document

     4       The path is an SR-specific SFP.         This document

     5       The path is a compact SR-specific SFP.  This document

6.5.  New IRO Sub-object Type

   This document defines a new IRO sub-object type for the SFC as
   follows:

    Type       Sub-object

    5          Service Function ID

7.  Security considerations

   This document does not introduce any new security considerations.
