          Revision to Capability Codes Registration Procedures
         draft-scudder-idr-capabilities-registry-change-00.txt

Abstract

   This document updates RFC 5492 by making a change to the registration
   procedures for BGP Capability Codes.  Specifically, the range
   formerly designated "Reserved for Private Use" is divided into three
   new ranges, respectively designated as "Standards Action",
   "Experimental" and "Reserved".

1.  Introduction

   [RFC5492] designates the range of Capability Codes 128-255 as
   "Reserved for Private Use".  Subsequent experience has shown this to
   be not only useless, but actively confusing to implementors.  BGP
   Capability Codes do not meet the criteria for "Reserved for Private
   Use" described in [RFC5226] S. 4.1.  An example of a legitimate
   "private use" code point might be a BGP community [RFC1997] value
   assigned for use within a given AS, but no analogous use of
   Capabilities exists.

   Accordingly, this document revises the registration procedures for
   the range 128-255, as follows, using the terminology defined in
   [RFC5226]:

   128-250: Standards Action

   251-254: Experimental Use

   255: Reserved

   The procedures for the ranges 1-63 and 64-127 are unchanged,
   remaining "IETF Review" and "First Come First Served" respectively.

2.  Discussion

   The reason for choosing Standards Action and not some other policy is
   that it provides opportunity for working group oversight of the
   space, when and if it becomes depleted.  At time of writing there is
   ample space available in both the IETF Review and First Come First
   Served portions of the 1-127 range.  Note that any unallocated space
   in this range can be reclassified with some other allocation policy
   in the future, if needed.

   The reason for providing an Experimental Use range is to preserve a
   range for use during early development.  Although there are few
   practical differences between Experimental and Private Use, the
   change both makes it clear that code points from this space should
   not be used long-term or in shipping products, and reduces the
   consumption of the scarce Capability Code space expended for this
   purpose.  Once classified as Experimental, it should be considered
   difficult to reclassify the space for some other purpose in the
   future.

   The reason for reserving the maximum value is that it may be useful
   in the future if extension of the number space is needed.

3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to revise the "Capability Codes" registry as
   described in Section 1.

4.  Security Considerations

   This revision to registration procedures does not change the
   underlying security issues inherent in the existing [RFC5492] and
   [RFC4271].
