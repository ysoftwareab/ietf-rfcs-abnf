1. The Network Management Framework

   The Internet-standard Network Management Framework consists of three
   components. They are:

   RFC 1902 [1] which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
   describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.

   RFC 1213, STD 17, [3] which defines MIB-II, the core set of managed
   objects for the Internet suite of protocols.

   RFC 1905 [4] which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for network
   access to managed objects.

   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of



Romascanu, et. al.                                              [Page 2]

   experimentation and evaluation.

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Within a given MIB module,
   objects are defined using the SMI's OBJECT-TYPE macro.  At a minimum,
   each object has a name, a syntax, an access-level, and an
   implementation-status.

   The name is an object identifier, an administratively assigned name,
   which specifies an object type. The object type together with an
   object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation
   of the object.  For human convenience, we often use a textual string,
   termed the object descriptor, to also refer to the object type.

   The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data structure
   corresponding to that object type. The ASN.1 [6] language is used for
   this purpose.  However, RFC 1902 purposely restricts the ASN.1
   constructs which may be used.  These restrictions are explicitly made
   for simplicity.

   The access-level of an object type defines whether it makes "protocol
   sense" to read and/or write the value of an instance of the object
   type.  (This access-level is independent of any administrative
   authorization policy.)

   The implementation-status of an object type indicates whether the
   object is mandatory, optional, obsolete, or deprecated.

2. Overview

   This document continues the architecture created in the RMON MIB [12]
   by providing RMON analysis for switched networks(SMON).

   Remote network monitoring devices, often called monitors or probes,
   are instruments that exist for the purpose of managing a network.
   Often these remote probes are stand-alone devices and devote
   significant internal resources for the sole purpose of managing a
   network.  An organization may employ many of these devices, one per
   network segment, to manage its internet. In addition, these devices
   may be used for a network management service provider to access a
   client network, often geographically remote.

   The objects defined in this document are intended as an interface
   between an RMON agent and an RMON management application and are not
   intended for direct manipulation by humans.  While some users may
   tolerate the direct display of some of these objects, few will
   tolerate the complexity of manually manipulating objects to
   accomplish row creation.  These functions should be handled by the

   management application.

2.1 Remote Network Management Goals

       o Offline Operation

           There are sometimes conditions when a management
           station will not be in constant contact with its
           remote monitoring devices.  This is sometimes by
           design in an attempt to lower communications costs
           (especially when communicating over a WAN or
           dialup link), or by accident as network failures
           affect the communications between the management
           station and the probe.

           For this reason, this MIB allows a probe to be
           configured to perform diagnostics and to collect
           statistics continuously, even when communication with
           the management station may not be possible or
           efficient.  The probe may then attempt to notify
           the management station when an exceptional condition
           occurs.  Thus, even in circumstances where
           communication between management station and probe is
           not continuous, fault, performance, and configuration
           information may be continuously accumulated and
           communicated to the management station conveniently
           and efficiently.

       o Proactive Monitoring

           Given the resources available on the monitor, it
           is potentially helpful for it continuously to run
           diagnostics and to log network performance.  The
           monitor is always available at the onset of any
           failure.  It can notify the management station of the
           failure and can store historical statistical
           information about the failure.  This historical
           information can be played back by the management
           station in an attempt to perform further diagnosis
           into the cause of the problem.


       o Problem Detection and Reporting

           The monitor can be configured to recognize
           conditions, most notably error conditions, and
           continuously to check for them.  When one of these
           conditions occurs, the event may be logged, and



Romascanu, et. al.                                              [Page 4]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 July 1997


           management stations may be notified in a number of
           ways.

       o Value Added Data

           Because a remote monitoring device represents a
           network resource dedicated exclusively to network
           management functions, and because it is located
           directly on the monitored portion of the network, the
           remote network monitoring device has the opportunity
           to add significant value to the data it collects.
           For instance, by highlighting those hosts on the
           network that generate the most traffic or errors, the
           probe can give the management station precisely the
           information it needs to solve a class of problems.


       o Multiple Managers

           An organization may have multiple management stations
           for different units of the organization, for different
           functions (e.g. engineering and operations), and in an
           attempt to provide disaster recovery.  Because
           environments with multiple management stations are
           common, the remote network monitoring device has to
           deal with more than own management station,
           potentially using its resources concurrently.

2.2 Switched Networks Monitoring

   This document addresses issues related to applying "Remote
   Technology" to Switch Networks. Switches today differ from standard
   shared media protocols:


   1)   Data is not, in general, broadcast.  This may be caused by the
        switch architecture  or by the connection-oriented nature of the
        data. This means, therefore, the monitoring non-broadcast
        traffic needs to be considered.


   2)   Monitoring the multiple entry and exit points from a switching
        device requires a vast amount of resources - memory and CPU, and
        aggregation of the data in logical packets of information,
        determined by the application needs.


   3)   Switching incorporates logical segmentation such as Virtual LANs



Romascanu, et. al.                                              [Page 5]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 July 1997


        (vLANs).


   4)   Switching incorporates packet prioritization.


   5)   Data across the switch fabric can be in the form of cells. Like
        RMON, SMON is only concerned with the monitoring of packets.


   Differences such as these make monitoring difficult.  The current
   RMON-1 and RMON-2 standards do not provide for things that are unique
   to switches or switched environments.

   In order to overcome the limitations of the existing standards, new
   monitoring mechanisms have been implemented by vendors of switching
   equipment. All these monitoring strategies are currently proprietary
   in nature.

   This document attempts to provide the framework to include different
   switching strategies and allow for monitoring operations consistent
   with the RMON framework. This MIB is limited to monitoring, and con-
   trol operations aimed in providing monitoring data for RMON probes.

2.3 Mechanisms for Monitoring Switched Networks

   The following mechanisms are used by SMON devices, for the purpose of
   monitoring switched networks.

2.3.1 DataSource Objects

   The RMON MIB standard [12] defines data source objects which point to
   MIB-II interfaces, identified by instances of ifIndex objects.

   The SMON MIB extends this concept and allows for other types of
   objects to be defined as data sources for RMON and/or SMON data.
   Three forms of dataSources are described:

         ifIndex.<I>

          Traditional RMON dataSources.  Called 'port-based'
          for ifType.<I> not equal to 'propVirtual(53)'.


         smonVlanDataSource.<V>

          A dataSource of this form refers to a 'Packet-based VLAN' and
          is called a 'VLAN-based' dataSource. <V> is the VLAN ID, as



Romascanu, et. al.                                              [Page 6]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 July 1997


          defined by the IEEE 802.1Q standard [14].


         entPhysicalEntry.<N>

          A dataSource of this form refers to a physical entity within
          the agent and is called an 'entity-based' dataSource.

   In addition to these new dataSource types, SMON introduces a new
   group called dataSourceCapsTable to aid an NMS to discover dataSource
   identity and attributes.

   The extended data source mechanism supported by the SMON MIB allows
   for the use of external collection points, similar to the one defined
   and supported by the RMON-1 and RMON-2 MIBs, as well as internal col-
   lection points(e.g. propVirtual ifTable entry, entPhysicalEntry).
   The latter reflects either data sources which may be the result of
   aggregation(e.g.switch-wide) or internal channels of physical enti-
   ties, which have the capability of being monitored by an SMON probe.


2.3.2 Copy Port

   In order to make the switching devices support RMON statistics, many
   vendors have implemented a port copy feature, allowing traffic to be
   replicated from switch port to switch port. Several levels of confi-
   guration are possible:

      1) 1 src port to 1 dst port
      2) N src ports  to 1 dst port
      3) M src ports to N dst ports

   The SMON standard presents a standard MIB interface which allows for
   the control of this function.

   Note that this function can apply to devices that have no other SMON
   or RMON functionality than  copy port. The agent of such a device
   would support only the portCopyCaps and the portCopyConfig MIB
   groups, out of the whole SMON MIB.  Switch vendors are encouraged to
   implement this subset of the SMON MIB, as it would allow for standard
   port copy configuration from the same NMS application that does RMON
   or SMON.

   Port copy may cause congestion problems on the SMON device. This
   situation is more likely occur when copying from a port of higher
   speed to a port of lower speed or copy from multiple port to a single
   port.




Romascanu, et. al.                                              [Page 7]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 July 1997


   Particular implementations may chose to build protection mechanisms
   that would prevent creation of new port copy links, when the capacity
   of the destination port is exceeded. The MIB allows for implementa-
   tions to (if supported) instrument a destination drop count on port
   copy to provide NMS applications a sense of the quality of data
   presented at the destination port.


2.3.3 Vlan Monitoring

   Vlan monitoring can be accomplished by using a VLAN-based dataSource
   and/or by configuring smonVlanIdStats and/or smonVlanPrioStats col-
   lections.  These functions allow VLAN-ID or user priority distribu-
   tions per dataSource. Vlan monitoring provides a high-level view of
   total Vlan usages and relative non-unicast traffic usage as well as a
   profile of Vlan priority as defined in the 3-bit user_priority field.


   NOTE: priority stats reflect what was parsed from the packet, not
   what priority, if any, was necessarily granted by the switch.

2.4  Relationship to Other MIBs

2.4.1 The RMON and RMON2 MIBs

   The Remote Monitoring MIB (RMON-1) [12] provides several management
   functions that may be directly or indirectly applicable to switched
   networks.

   The port copy mechanisms defined by the RMON MIB allow for the desti-
   nation ports to become data source for any RMON-1 statistics. How-
   ever, an NMS application should check whether it is in the device
   capability(portCopyCap) to filter errors from a source to a destina-
   tion port and whether this capability is enabled, in order to provide
   a correct interpretation of the copied port traffic.

   RMON I host and matrix group statistics entries may be aggregated by
   use of the extended dataSource capability defined in SMON. RMON II
   groups are similarly extended through the use of SMON's dataSource
   definition.

   RMON-1 also defines a simple thresholding monitoring mechanism,
   event-logging and event-notification for any MIB instance; SMON util-
   izes the alarms and events groups from RMON-1 without modification.
   These groups should be implemented on SMON devices if a simple thres-
   holding mechanism is desired.





Romascanu, et. al.                                              [Page 8]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 July 1997


   The RMON II usrHistory group (user-defined history collection) should
   be implemented by an SMON device if a history collection mechanism is
   desired for smonStats entries.

2.4.2 The Interfaces Group MIB

   The Interfaces Group MIB [5], [17] extends aspects of MIB-II [3].
   This document discusses the 'interfaces' group of MIB-II, especially
   the experience gained from the definition of numerous media- specific
   MIB modules for use in conjunction with the 'interfaces' group for
   managing various sub-layers beneath the internetwork- layer.  It
   specifies clarifications to, and extensions of, the architectural
   issues within the previous model used for the 'interfaces' group.

   The Interfaces Group MIB also includes a MIB module.  As well as
   including new MIB definitions to support the architectural exten-
   sions, this MIB module also re-specifies the 'interfaces' group of
   MIB-II in a manner that is both compliant to the SNMPv2 SMI and
   semantically- identical to the existing SNMPv1-based definitions.

   The SMON MIB utilizes the propVirtual(53) ifType defined in The
   Interfaces Group MIB [17] to provide SMON and RMON with new
   dataSources such as Vlans and internal monitoring points. NMS appli-
   cations should consult the SMON dataSource capabilities group
   (dataSourceCap) for a description of these virtual interfaces.

2.4.3 The Entity MIB

   The scope of the Entity MIB [13] is to allow an NMS to interrogate a
   standard SNMP context and thereby discover what logical and physical
   entities exist, how to access the MIB information of each logical
   entity, and the relationships between the various entities. The MIB
   should support both a single agent or multiple agents in one physical
   entity.

   A "physical entity" or "physical component" represents an identifi-
   able physical resource within a managed system. Zero or more logical
   entities may utilize a physical resource at any given time. It is an
   implementation-specific manner as to which physical components are
   represented by an agent in the EntPhysicalTable.  Typically, physical
   resources (e.g. communications ports, backplanes, sensors, daughter-
   cards, power supplies, the overall chassis, the overall switch),
   which can be managed via functions associated with one or more logi-
   cal entities are included in the MIB.

   The SMON MIB does not mandate Entity MIB support, but allows for phy-
   sical entities, as defined by this MIB to be defined as SMON data
   sources. For such cases, the support for the EntPhysicalTable is



Romascanu, et. al.                                              [Page 9]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 July 1997


   required.

2.4.4 The Bridge MIB

   One of the important indicators for measuring the effectiveness of a
   switching device is the ratio between the number of forwarded frames
   and the number of dropped frames at the switch port.

   It is out of the scope of this MIB to provide instrumentation infor-
   mation relative to switching devices. However, such indication may be
   part of other MIB modules.

   For instance the Bridge MIB [18] provides such MIB objects, for the
   802.1 bridges (dot1dTpPortInFrames, dot1dTpPortInDiscards) and
   switches managed according to the 802.1 bridge model may provide this
   information.

2.5 Relationship with IEEE 802.1 Standards

   The SMON MIB provides simple statistics per vLAN and priority levels.
   Those two categories of statistics are of higher importance for
   switched networks managers. Interoperability for those features is
   ensured by the use of the IEEE 802.1 p/Q standards ([14], [15])
   defined by the IEEE 802.1 WG. Interoperability from the SMON MIB
   point of view is ensured by referencing the IEEE definition of vLANs
   and priority levels, for the SMON statistics.

3. SMON/RMON Groups

3.1 ProbeCapabilities Additions

   The RMON probeCapabilities bitmask needs to be republished with some
   new BIT definitions for the SMON MIB:

       - smonVlanStats(33)
         The probe supports the smonVlanStats object group.

       - smonPrioStats(34)
         The probe supports the smonPrioStats object group.

       - dataSource(35)
         The probe supports the dataSource object group.

       - portCopy(36)
         The probe supports the portCopy object group.


   NOTE: bits 27-32 are reserved for HC-RMON MIB groups.

3.2 smonVlanStats

   The smonVlanStats MIB group includes the control and statistics
   objects related to 802.1q Vlans. Specific statistics per 802.1q vir-
   tual LAN are supported. The group provides a high level view of total
   Vlan usage, and relative non-unicast traffic usage.

   It is an implementation-specific matter as to how the agent deter-
   mines the proper default-VLAN for untagged or priority-tagged frames.

3.3 smonPrioStats

   The smonPrioStatsTable provides a distribution based on the
   user_priority field in the VLAN header.

   Note that this table merely reports priority as encoded in VLAN
   headers, not the priority (if any) given the frame for actual switch-
   ing purposes.


3.4 dataSourceCaps

   The dataSourceCaps MIB group identifies all supported data sources on
   an SMON device. An NMS may use this table to discover the RMON and
   Copy Port attributes of each data source.

   Upon restart of the agent, the dataSourceTable, ifTable and entPhysi-
   calTable are initialized for the available data sources. The agent
   may modify these tables as data sources become known or are
   removed(e.g. hot swap of interfaces, chassis cards or the discovery
   of Vlan usage).  It is understood that dataSources representing VLANs
   may not always be instantiated immediately upon restart, but rather
   as VLAN usage is detected by the agent.  The agent should attempt to
   create dataSource and interface entries for all dataSources as soon
   as possible.

   For each dataSourceCapsEntry representing a VLAN or entPhysicalEntry,
   the agent must create an associated ifEntry with a ifType value of
   'propVirtual(53)'.  This ifEntry will be used as the actual value in
   RMON control table dataSource objects.  The assigned ifIndex value is
   copied into the associated dataSourceCapsIfIndex object.

3.5 portCopyConfig

   The portCopyConfig MIB group includes the objects defined for the
   control of the port copy functionality in a device.



Romascanu, et. al.                                             [Page 11]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 July 1997


   The standard does not place a limit on the mode by which this copy
   function may be used:

   Mode 1 --  1:1 Copy

      Single dataSource copied to a single destination dataSource.
      Agent may limit configuration based on ifTypes, ifSpeeds, half-
      duplex/full-duplex, or agent resources.  In this mode the single
      instance of the portCopyDstDroppedFrames object refers to dropped
      frames on the portCopyDest interface.

   Mode 2 --  N:1 Copy

      Multiple dataSources copied to a single destination dataSource.
      Agent may limit configuration based on ifTypes, ifSpeeds, half-
      duplex/full-duplex, portCopyDest over-subscription, or agent
      resources.  In this mode all N instances of the portCopyDstDrop-
      pedFrames object should contain the same value, and refer to
      dropped frames on the portCopyDest interface.

   Mode 3 --  N:M Copy

      Multiple dataSources copied to multiple destination dataSources.
      Agent may limit configuration based on ifTypes, ifSpeeds, half-
      duplex/full-duplex, portCopyDest over-subscription, or agent
      resources.  In this mode all N instances of the portCopyDstDrop-
      pedFrames object should the droppedFrames counter associated with
      the portCopyDest INDEX value for the specific entry, and refer to
      the total dropped frames on that portCopyDest interface (i.e., a
      single droppedFrames counter is maintained for each value of M).

   The rows do not have an OwnerString, since multiple rows may be part
   of the same portCopy operation. The agent is expected to activate or
   deactivate entries one at a time, based on the rowStatus for the
   given row.  This can lead to unpredictable results in Modes 2 and 3
   in applications utilizing the portCopy target traffic, if multiple
   PDUs are used to fully configure the operation.  It is recommended
   that an entire portCopy operation be configured in one SetRequest PDU
   if possible.

   The portCopyDest object may not reference an interface associated
   with a packet-based VLAN (rmonVlanDataSource.V), but this dataSource
   type may be used as a portCopySource.

4.  Control of Remote Network Monitoring Devices

   Due to the complex nature of the available functions in these dev-
   ices, the functions often need user configuration.  In many cases,



Romascanu, et. al.                                             [Page 12]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 July 1997


   the function requires parameters to be set up for a data collection
   operation.  The operation can proceed only after these parameters are
   fully set up.

   Many functional groups in this MIB have one or more tables in which
   to set up control parameters, and one or more data tables in which to
   place the results of the operation.  The control tables are typically
   read/write in nature, while the data tables are typically read/only.
   Because the parameters in the control table often describe resulting
   data in the data table, many of the parameters can be modified only
   when the control entry is not active.  Thus, the method for modifying
   these parameters is to de-activate the entry, perform the SNMP Set
   operations to modify the entry, and then re-activate the entry.
   Deleting the control entry causes the deletion of any associated data
   entries, which also gives a convenient method for reclaiming the
   resources used by the associated data.

   Some objects in this MIB provide a mechanism to execute an action on
   the remote monitoring device.  These objects may execute an action as
   a result of a change in the state of the object.  For those objects
   in this MIB, a request to set an object to the same value as it
   currently holds would thus cause no action to occur.

   To facilitate control by multiple managers, resources have to be
   shared among the managers.  These resources are typically the memory
   and computation resources that a function requires.

   The control mechanisms defined and used in this MIB are the same as
   those defined in the RMON MIB [11], for control functionality and
   interaction with multiple managers.

-- The VLAN Statistics Table
-- The smonVlanIdStatsTable provides a distribution based on the IEEE 802.1Q
-- VLAN-ID (VID), for each frame attributed to the data source for the
-- collection.

-- This function applies the same rules for attributing frames to VLAN-based
-- collections. RMON VLAN statistics are collected after the Ingress Rules
-- defined in section 3.13 of the VLAN Specification (P802.1Q/D4)
-- are applied.

-- It is possible that entries in this table will be garbage-collected, based
-- on agent resources, and VLAN configuration. Agents are encouraged to
-- support all 4096 index values and not garbage collect this table.

7.  Security Considerations

   In order to implement this MIB, an agent must make certain management
   information available about various logical and physical entities
   within a managed system, which may be considered sensitive in some
   network environments.

   Therefore, a network administrator may wish to employ instance-level
   access control, and configure the Entity MIB access (i.e., community
   strings in SNMPv1 and SNMPv2C), such that certain instances within
   this MIB, are excluded from particular MIB views.
