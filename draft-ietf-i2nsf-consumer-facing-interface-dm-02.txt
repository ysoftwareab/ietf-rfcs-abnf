1.  Introduction

   This document provides a YANG [RFC6020] data model that defines the
   required data for the Consumer-Facing Interface between an Interface
   to Network Security Functions (I2NSF) User and Security Controller in
   an I2NSF system [i2nsf-framework] in a Network Functions
   Virtualization (NFV) environment.  The data model is required for
   enabling different users of a given I2NSF system to define, manage
   and monitor security policies for specific flows within an

   administrative domain.  This document defines a YANG data model based
   on the information model of I2NSF Consumer-Facing Interface
   [client-facing-inf-im].

   Data models are defined at a lower level of abstraction and provide
   many details.  They provide details about the implementation of a
   protocol's specification, e.g., rules that explain how to map managed
   objects onto lower-level protocol constructs.  Since conceptual
   models can be implemented in different ways, multiple data models can
   be derived by a single information model.

   The efficient and flexible provisioning of network functions by NFV
   leads to a rapid advance in the network industry.  As practical
   applications, network security functions (NSFs), such as firewall,
   intrusion detection system (IDS)/intrusion protection system (IPS),
   and attack mitigation, can also be provided as virtual network
   functions (VNF) in the NFV system.  By the efficient virtual
   technology, these VNFs might be automatically provisioned and
   dynamically migrated based on real-time security requirements.  This
   document presents a YANG data model to implement security functions
   based on NFV.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC3444].

3.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology described in
   [i2nsf-terminology][client-facing-inf-im][client-facing-inf-req].

4.  Data Modeling for Security Policies for Consumer-Facing Interface

   The main objective of this data model is to fully transform the
   information model [client-facing-inf-im] into a YANG data model that
   can be used for delivering control and management messages via the
   Consumer-Facing Interface between an I2NSF User and Security
   Controller for the I2NSF User's high-level security policies.

   The semantics of the data model must be aligned with the information
   model of the Consumer-Facing Interface.  The transformation of the
   information model was performed so that this YANG data model can
   facilitate the efficient delivery of the control or management
   messages.

   This data model is designed to support the I2NSF framework that can
   be extended according to the security needs.  In other words, the
   model design is independent of the content and meaning of specific
   policies as well as the implementation approach.  This document
   suggests a VoIP/VoLTE security service as a use case for policy rule
   generation.

   Multi-tenancy in this document enables multiple administrative
   domains in order to manage application resources.  An Enterprise
   organization may have multiple tenants or departments such as human
   resources (HR), finance, and legal departments.  Thus, we need an
   object which defines a set of permissions assigned to a user in an
   organization that wants to manage its own Security Policies.  You can
   think of it as a way to assign policy users to a job function or a
   set of permissions within the organization.  The policy-role object
   SHALL have Name, Date and access-profile to grant or deny permissions
   for the perpose of security policy management.

5.  Use Case: Policy Instance Example for VoIP/VoLTE Security Services

   A common scenario for VoIP/VoLTE policy enforcement could be that a
   malicious call is made to a benign user of any telecommunication
   company.  For example, imagine a case wherea company "A" employs a
   hacker with a malicious attempt to hack a user's phone with malware.
   The company "A" is located in a country, such as Africa, and uses the
   user's hacked phone to call the company.  The hacked user is unaware
   of the company "A" so complains about the international call that was
   made to the company "B", which is the user's telecommunications
   company.  The company "A" charges the company "B" for the

   international call.  The company "B" cannot charge the user for the
   call, and has no choice but to pay the company "A".  The following
   shows the example data tree model for the VoIP/VoLTE services.
   Multi-tenancy, endpoint groups, threat prevention, and telemetry data
   components are general part of the tree model, so we can just modify
   the policy instance in order to generate and enforce high-level
   policies.  The policy-calendar can act as a scheduler to set the star
   and end time to block calls which uses suspicious ids, or calls from
   other countries.

5.1.  Policy Instance YANG Example for VoIP/VoLTE Security Services

   The following YANG data model is a policy instance for VoIP/VoLTE
   security services.  The policy-calendar can act as a scheduler to set
   the start time and end time to block malicious calls which use
   suspicious IDs, or calls from other countries.

     Figure 4: Policy Instance YANG Example for VoIP Security Services

6.  Example XML Output for Various Use Cases

   In this section, we present an XML example for various use cases.
   Here, we show the policy examples that can be delivered through
   consumer-facing interface.  For now, the considered use cases are:
   VoIP security service, DDoS-attack mitigation, time-based firewall,
   and web-filter.

6.1.  Case 1: VoIP Security Service

   The first example is a VoIP policy.  Here, we are going to drop calls
   commin from a country with an Ip from South Africa that is classified
   as malicious.  The below figure shows the XML document generated by
   using the YANG data tree as shown in the previous section.

6.2.  Case 2: DDoS-Attack Mitigation

   The second example is a DDoS-attack mitigation policy.  Here, the
   time information is not set because the service provided by the
   network should be maintained at all times.  If the packets sent by
   any sources are more than the set threshold, then the admin can set
   the percentage of the packets to be dropped to safely maintain the
   service.

   The third example is a time-based firewall policy.  Consider a Smart
   Factory which operates from 9 am to 7 pm during the working days.
   During these hours, only the admin responsible for operating the
   factory is allow to access a control system.  The below figure show
   that any access during outside the operating hours is rejected.

6.5.  Case 5: Threat-Feed Configuration

   The threat-feed container described above can convey various sources
   containing information concerning security threats.  One good example
   can be STIX.  STIX (Structured Threat Information Expression) is a

   language and serialization format used to exchange cyber threat
   intelligence (CTI).  It is a lanauge to describe threat information
   in a standardized format to enable exchanging and sharing them.  The
   blow figure show the necessary configuration, which can be generated
   and delivered by consumer-facing interface.

   Usually, STIX can be obtained from a TAXII server which contains a
   collection of cyber threat information formatted in STIX.  Here, the
   "feed-server" leaf contains the ip-address of the TAXII server, so
   that recent threat related information can be collected when the
   configuration is set.

7.  Security Considerations

   The data model for the I2NSF Consumer-Facing Interface is derived
   from the I2NSF Consumer-Facing Interface Information Model
   [client-facing-inf-im], so the same security considerations with the
   information model should be included in this document.  The data
   model needs to support a mechanism to protect Consumer-Facing
   Interface to Security Controller.

Appendix A.  Changes from draft-ietf-i2nsf-consumer-facing-interface-
             dm-01

   The following changes have been made from draft-ietf-i2nsf-consumer-
   facing-interface-dm-01:

   o  In Section 6, four additional XML output examples (VoIP, DDoS-
      attack, Time-based Firewall and Web-filter) for security policies
      are added.  Also, an example XML output for Threat-feed
      configuration is added using STIX and TAXII as a threat-feed
      example.

   o  The overall organization of the YANG data model and its data types
      have also been reviewed and corrected, and produced the
      corresponding data tree as shown in the Sections 4 and 5.

   o  Overall editorial errors have been corrected.
