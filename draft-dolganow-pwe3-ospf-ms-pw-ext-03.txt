   switched network over a sparse mesh of PSN tunnels and PW control 
   protocol sessions.  MS-PWs can be used to scale PW based networks  

   over both a single AS, or between multiple ASs, and there is a 
   particular need to be able to dynamically route MS-PWs through a 
   given AS to reach PEs at or beyond the edge of the AS, where the 
   route of the PW through each AS needs to be automatically determined. 

   This draft proposes extensions to OSPF to enable the automatic

1. Introduction 

   Multi-segment pseudowires have been defined to enable emulated layer 
   2 services to be delivered from an IP based packet switched network 
   over a sparse mesh of PSN tunnels and PW control protocol 
   adjacencies. MS-PWs can be used to scale PW based networks over both 
   a single AS, and multiple ASs.  Requirements for MS-PWs are detailed 
   in [8]. 

   A basic approach to MS-PWs, where the switching points are statically 
   placed, is described in [10].  This is extended in [11]to allow the 
   automatic placement of the MS-PWs.  This draft uses FEC 129 with AII 
   type II to summarize the PW end points that are reachable through a 
   given PE, and to provide a layer 2 address for the S-PEs. MP-BGP is 
   used to distribute FECs.  

   The use of MP-BGP is primarily focused on scenarios where each PWE3 
   domain is a separate AS, and S-PEs are used to switch PWs between 
   adjacent ASs.  MP-BGP; therefore, provides the BGP-enabled T-PE or S-
   PE at the ingress of the AS with reachability information for AIIs at 
   or beyond the border of the AS. This provides sufficient information 
   to dynamically route the PW across the AS when there is a direct PSN 
   tunnel between the ingress and egress S-PE or T-PE. When there is no 
   direct PSN tunnel, a mechanisms must be provided to determine an 
   indirect route for the PW via some intermediate S-PE within an AS 
   domain.

   A second important case is where MS-PWs are deployed in service 
   provider access and metro networks. Pseudowires in these networks 
   typically span only a single IGP domain or AS. Furthermore, the nodes 
   contain a minimal routing implementation to cut on the operational 
   complexity. In such networks MP-BGP is not typically deployed on MTUs 
   and full MP-BGP functionality may not be required. This prevents 
   methods defined in [11] to be employed; however, the need to be able 
   to dynamically route MS-PWs through these topologies still exists. 

   To enable automatic placement of MS-PWs in the above described cases, 
   it is possible to leverage the mechanisms of the PSN IGP to 
   distribute MS-PW endpoint reachability information.  This draft 
   proposes extensions to OSPF to enable the automatic advertisement of 
   summarized PW layer 2 addresses within a single AS, thus enabling the 
   automatic placement of MS-PWs across an OSPF domain.  The advertised 
   information is used by T-PEs and S-PEs to derive the MS-PW next hop 
   route which is used then to signal the next-hop S-PE or T-PE, as 
   described in [11].  The draft also describes mechanisms to isolate 
   OSPF advertisements used for MS-PWs from those used for routing in 
   the underlying PSN to avoid any overloading of the IGP routing by the 
   mechanisms proposed.

               Figure 1 MS-PW Routing Model for a Single AS 

   Figure 1 illustrates the MS-PW routing model for a single AS.  ACs 
   attached to T-PE2 are associated with the OSPF Router_ID or any 
   locally assigned routable address.  Each S-PE / T-PE is also assigned 
   its own layer 2 address in the form of an AII as described in [11].

   The proposed model requires the existence of PSN tunnels between T-
   PE/S-PE, S-PE/S-PE and/or S-PE/T-PE.  PWs are established on these 
   tunnels using Targeted LDP signaling [11].  

   When a PSN tunnel exists and can be used for the establishment of MS-
   PW or it segment, T-PE advertises the set of exterior AIIs reachable 
   via this tunnel.  This is done using summarized Type 2 AIIs so that a 
   separate advertisement is not required for every AC reachable via 
 
   that tunnel.  AIIs may be summarized using the aggregation rules for 
   AII Type 2 described in [6].  When an advertisement is received by an 
   S-PE and the S-PE has a PSN tunnel connectivity to the advertising 
   PE, the advertisement is installed in the S-PE's routing information 
   and the S-PE summarizes AIIs at the far end of the tunnel in its own 
   advertisement for propagation in the AS backbone and further 
   propagation into other areas.  When an advertisement is received by a 
   T-PE and the T-PE has PSN tunnel connectivity to the advertising PE, 
   the advertisement is installed in the PE's routing information base.  
   As an alternative to this summarization-based population of an 
   advertisement at S-PEs, a static (through configuration) method may 
   be employed at the S-PE in order to populate the AIIs reachable 
   through it. 

   Based on the advertised information, each PE builds a routing 
   information base containing all exterior AIIs reachable through a 
   given next hop S-PE.  When creating a MS-PW, the PE looks up the AII 
   and determines the next hop S-PE or T-PE for LDP signaling, as 
   described in [11]. 

   Figure 1 depicts the simple model of a one-to-one relationship of T-
   PE to S-PE and S-PE to S-PE, and of a single S-PE to S-PE segment.  
   In the general case, multiple S-PE segments will exist, and the 
   relationship between two S-PEs and/or the T-PE and S-PEs will be one-
   to-many or many-to-one.  Processing in these cases follows that of 
   the general case illustrated in Figure 1.  Selection of an S-PE from 
   a set of multiple available next-hop S-PEs may be achieved by 
   comparing the IGP metrics for the route to the terminating T-PE (TT-
   PE) via each of these next-hop S-PEs.

3. Applicability 

   The proposed OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 protocol extensions are intended for 
   domains where MP-BGP is not used and/or only a partial mesh of PSN 
   tunnels exists.  In many cases, this will apply to routing MS-PWs 
 
 
   across a single AS, where the source T-PE (ST-PE), the Terminating T-
   PE (TT-PE) and all of the intermediate S-PEs reside in the same AS.  

   However, the above application may also be used where OSPF is used to 
   route one portion of a MS-PW across a given AS where the ST-PE and 
   the TT-PE reside in different ASs.  Here, OSPF is used to advertise 
   the AIIs reachable through S-PEs corresponding to ASBRs.  This 
   enables the ingress S-PEs and intermediate S-PEs in an AS to route 
   MS-PWs to the correct egress S-PE in the AS to reach a TT-PE in 
   another AS.  This draft does not define how the egress S-PE learns 
   what AIIs are externally reachable through it, but this could be by 
   configuration, or by learning the exterior reachable addresses from 
   an exterior gateway protocol such as BGP.  

4. OSPF Extensions 

4.1. Attachment Circuit Addressing 

   As in [11], attachment circuit addressing is derived from AII type 2 
   [2], as shown in the following figure: 

       0                   1                   2                   3 
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
      |      Global ID (contd.)       |           Prefix              | 
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
      |      Prefix (contd.)          |            AC ID              | 
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
      |      AC ID (contd.)           | 
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
                    Figure 2 Attachment Circuit Addressing 

    
   Implementations of this procedure MUST interpret the AII as described 
   in [11].  

4.2. OSPFv2 LSAs 

   This extension makes use of the opaque LSA. 
 
Dolganow, et. al.      Expires October 15, 2009               [Page 6] 

Internet-Draft   OSPF Extensions for Dynamic MS-PWs         April 2009 
    

   One new LSA is defined: the PW Switching LSA.  This LSA describes the 
   S-PEs/T-PEs, PSN tunnel(s) between peer S-PEs or T-PEs, and AII 
   addresses reachable. 

4.2.1. Pseudowire Switching LSA 

   OSPFv2 routers behaving as S-PEs or T-PEs advertise the layer 2 
   addresses reachable through them.  This advertisement MUST be in an 
   AS-scoped or Area-scoped opaque LSA described in [3].  

   The 'O' bit in the LSA Option field MUST be set to 1. The Opaque LSA 
   type is TBD. 

   [Note: IANA will assign the Opaque LSA value] 

   The LSA Information field is formatted as described in Section 4.4. 
      below. 

4.3. OSPFv3 LSAs 

4.3.1. Pseudowire Switching LSA 

   The OSPFv3 PW switching LSA has a function code of TBD.  The S1/S2 
   bit are set to indicate an AS flooding scope for the LSA.  The U bit 
   is set indicating the OSPFv3 PW switching LSA should be flooded even 
   if it is not understood.  The LSA Information field is formatted as 
   described in Section 4.4.  below. 

4.4. LSA Information Field 

   The LSA information consists of two or more nested Type/Length/Value 
   (TLV) triplets.  

   The LSA MUST contain a TLV for the IP address of the advertising 
   router.  For OSPF v2 routers, this is the Router Address TLV defined 
   in Section 2.4.1 of RFC 3630 [4]. For OSPF v3 routers, this is the 
   Router IPv6 Address TLV specified in Section 3 of draft-ietf-ospf-
   ospfv3-traffic-07.txt [5].  In each of these, the router address MUST 
   be set to the IP address of the advertising T-PE/S-PE. 

4.4.1. Exterior AII TLV 

   The Exterior AII TLV is used to describe addresses attached of 
   attached T-PEs or those routable through S-PEs to T-PEs in another 
   AS.  If the LSA information is of type AII, then the value field 
   contains one or more AII Type 2 TLVs, as described above.  

 

Dolganow, et. al.      Expires October 15, 2009               [Page 7] 

Internet-Draft   OSPF Extensions for Dynamic MS-PWs         April 2009 
    

   Exterior AIIs correspond to the AII (or AC) configured on a T-PE, 
   which must contain at least the prefix and global ID to be used in 
   FEC129 for signaling the PW endpoint.  The prefix may or may not be 
   directly related to the loopback address of the T-PE. 

5. LSA Processing Procedures 

   Nodes capable of pseudowire switching on either side of a PSN tunnel 
   exchange PW switching information using the Pseudowire Switching 
   opaque LSA.  These Pseudowire Switching LSAs are processed and 
   flooded as described in Section 5.2.  

5.1. P Routers 

   OSPF routers that receive LSAs described in this draft and that are 
   not S-PEs or T-PEs MUST flood them according to the rules of OSPFv2 
   or OSPFv3, as applicable. 

5.2. PE Routers 

   S-PEs and T-PEs that are OSPF routers and that receive LSAs described 
   in this draft MUST flood them according to the rules of OSPFv2 or 
   OSPFv3, as applicable.  These LSAs are also installed in a PW routing 
   database.  This routing database MAY be used by S-PEs and T-PEs to 
   calculate a PW routing table.  The PW routing table has the structure 
   described in Section 7 of [11], and is used to determine the next 
   signaling hop when a S-PE receives a PW setup message as described in 
   that draft.  PW static routes may also be provisioned, as described 
   in [11]. 

   S-PEs that are also OSPF ABR MAY opt to summarize the PW routing 
   information receive in type 10 area scoped opaque LSA.  The 
   summarization can be done in a similar way as for Ipv4 or ipv6 
   routes. 

   S-PEs that are ASBRs that receive type 10 LSAs described in this 
   draft MAY summarize Exterior AII TLVs received in non-backbone 
   advertisements in that S-PEs' own backbone advertisement, and MAY 
   summarize Exterior AII TLVs received in backbone advertisements in 
   that S-PEs non-backbone area advertisements. 

6. Deployment Considerations 

6.1. Addition and Removal of ACs, S-PEs and T-PEs 

   It is important that the impact of PW switching information 
   advertised on the underlying OSPF routing is minimized.  To achieve 
   that it is RECOMMENDED that:  
 
Dolganow, et. al.      Expires October 15, 2009               [Page 8] 

Internet-Draft   OSPF Extensions for Dynamic MS-PWs         April 2009 
    

   1. The Exterior AII TLV only contains the prefix and global ID of the 
      T-PE. Such summarization allows the content of the Exterior AII 
      TLV to remain unchanged when an AC is added or removed, thus 
      removing a need to re-advertise the Exterior AII TLV.  
      Likewise, no new LSA is advertised when AC connectivity flaps or 
      when a pseudowire is established/provisioned.  

   2. S-PEs use AII summarization that minimizes the impact on the S-
      PEs' advertisements into backbone on changes to Exterior AII TLV 
      received in a non-backbone advertisements. 

6.2. Impact on Existing P-Routers 

   P-routers supporting Opaque LSA processing procedures must exist 
   along the flooding path in the AS to ensure propagation of the 
   information required for dynamic pseudowire routing.  Ideally, 
   multiple "Opaque LSA" flooding paths exist, so a failure of a router 
   along a path does not isolate subset of a network. 

   Routers supporting Opaque LSA processing as described in [3] will 
   flood the LSAs as specified in [3].  The impact of this additional 
   Opaque LSA flooding load MAY be constrained through appropriate 
   levels of aggregation of AIIs as described in Section 6.1.  Section 
   6.3. describes complementary methods for limiting the impact of any 
   additional flooding. 

6.3. Congestion in the Underlying PSN Routing 

   This draft describes the use of the underlying interior gateway 
   protocol in an IP network to advertise routing information for the 
   automatic placement of MS-PWs.  Congestion may occur in the routing 
   plane of the PSN if a large amount of pseudowire LSAs are flooded.  
   It is therefore important to ensure that this does not degrade the 
   performance of the IGP for the underlying PSN.  

   Implementations MAY use a number of methods to avoid routing 
   congestion, including: 

   o Prioritization of PSN LSAs over PW Switching LSAs. 

   o Rate limiting PW Switching LSAs so that they do not consume 
      excessive bandwidth or route processor capacity. 

   o AII summarization methods as described in section 6.1. above 

   o OSPF Refresh and Flooding reduction mechanisms as defined in [7].

Internet-Draft   OSPF Extensions for Dynamic MS-PWs         April 2009 
    

     It is RECOMMENDED that implementations either: 

   o Use all of the above mentioned techniques to minimize the impact 
      of pseudowire switching advertisements on the underlying IGP 
      routing when a single routing instance is used, or 

   o Use a separate transport instance for pseudowire switching 
      advertisements. 

    

7. Security Considerations 

   The security discussion in Section 6 of [3]is also applicable to PW 
   routing information. 

8. IANA Considerations
