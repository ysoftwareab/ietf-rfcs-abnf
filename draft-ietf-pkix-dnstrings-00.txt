ABSTRACT

RFC 2253 [2] standardises a set of strings that can be used to 
represent attribute types in LDAP distinguished names. This list is 
does not cover the full set of attribute types used in the 
distinguished names of issuers and subjects in public key 
certificates. This document standardises the strings needed for these 
additional attribute types.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3].


1. Introduction

RFC 2253 standardises a set of strings for a limited number of 
attribute types that can be used in the LDAP encoding of X.500 
distinguished names. These are

                    String  X.500 AttributeType
                    ------------------------------
  CN      commonName
                    L       localityName
                    ST      stateOrProvinceName
                    O       organizationName
                    OU      organizationalUnitName
                    C       countryName
                    STREET  streetAddress
                    DC      domainComponent
                    UID     userid

The revision of RFC 2253 [5] states that additional attribute types 
should be represented by their object identifiers.

RFC 3039 [4] lists the following attribute types that may be used to 
create subject and issuer distinguished names:

countryName;
      commonName;
      surname;
      givenName;
      pseudonym;
      serialNumber;
      organizationName;
      organizationalUnitName;
      stateOrProvinceName
      localityName and
      postalAddress.

The observant reader will notice that the serialNumber, pseudonym, 
and postalAddress attribute types are missing from the RFC 2253 set 
and consequently do not have standardised strings for use in LDAP 
distinguished names.

Other examples are... [to be added by members of the PKIX group]


2. Additional LDAP String Definitions

This document defines the following additional strings that SHOULD be 
used to represent their respective attribute types in LDAP 
distinguished names, as given in the following table:

                    String        X.500 AttributeType
                    ----------------------------------
  serialNumber      serialNumber
  ADDR              postalAddress     
                    Pseudo            pseudonym

               [other strings to be added by members of PKIX group]

Note. The strings are case insensitive as far as LDAPv3 is concerned

3.  Security Considerations

The following security considerations are specific to the handling of
distinguished names.  LDAP security considerations are discussed in 
[6] and other documents comprising the LDAP Technical Specification 
[7].
