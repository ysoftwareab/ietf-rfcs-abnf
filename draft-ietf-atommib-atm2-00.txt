          draft        Supplemental ATM Management Objects    March 1995


          2.  Introduction

          This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
          Information Base (MIB) for use with network management
          protocols in the Internet community.  In particular, it
          describes objects used for managing ATM-based interfaces,
          devices, networks and services in addition to those defined in
          the ATM MIB [1], to provide additional support for the
          management of:
               - ATM Switched Virtual Connections (SVCs)
               - ATM Permanent Virtual Connections (PVCs)


          This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is both
          compliant to the SNMPv2 SMI, and semantically identical to the
          peer SNMPv1 definitions.

          This memo does not specify a standard for the Internet
          community.


          3.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

          The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework consists of four major
          components.  They are:

          0    RFC 1442 [2] which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used
               for describing and naming objects for the purpose of
               management.

          0    STD 17, RFC 1213 [3] defines MIB-II, the core set of
               managed objects for the Internet suite of protocols.

          0    RFC 1445 [4] which defines the administrative and other
               architectural aspects of the framework.

          0    RFC 1448 [5] which defines the protocol used for network
               access to managed objects.

          The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the
          purpose of experimentation and evaluation.

          4.  Object Definitions

          Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,
          termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the
          MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation
          One (ASN.1) defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object
          type is named by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively
          assigned name.  The object type together with an object
          instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation
          of the object.  For human convenience, we often use a textual
          string, termed the descriptor, to also refer to the object
          type.


          5.  Overview

          The purpose of this memo is to provide additional
          capabilities, not found in the ATM MIB [1], which are needed
          to manage ATM interfaces.  This memo addresses the following
          areas:
               - ATM Switch/Network/Host Support
               - ATM Switch/Network Support
               - ATM Host Support



          5.1.  Background

          In addition to the MIB module defined in this memo, other MIB
          modules are necessary to manage ATM interfaces, links and
          cross-connects.  Examples include MIB II for general system
          and interface management (RFC 1213 and RFC 1573), the DS3 or
          SONET MIBs for management of SONET and DS3 physical
          interfaces, and, as appropriate, MIB modules for applications
          that make use of ATM, such as SMDS [15] and LAN Emulation
          [14].  These MIB modules are outside the scope of this
          specification.

          This MIB module also requires the use of the ATM MIB module
          defined in [1].

          ATM Endpoint applications such as ATM LAN Emulation or
          Classical IP-over-ATM Clients and Servers use ATM to establish
          SVC/PVC connections for exchanging control and data
          information. The agents of these ATM applications must provide

          draft        Supplemental ATM Management Objects    March 1995


          the network manager with information on the SVC/PVCs in use
          and which applications are using them.  The information can be
          made generic so as to apply to all ATM applications.  This
          memo proposes extensions to the ATM MIB [1] in order to
          support this.

          The current specification of this supplemental ATM MIB is
          based on SNMPv2.

          5.2.  Supported Functions

          The managed ATM objects are arranged into the following
          groups:

          - ATM Switch/Network/Host Support:
                (1) ATM Switch/Network/Host Group
                (2) ATM Switch/Network/Host SVC Group
          - ATM Switch/Network Support:
                (3) ATM Switch/Network Group
                (4) ATM Switch/Network SVC Group
          - ATM Host Support:
                (5) ATM Host Group
                (6) ATM Host SVC Group


          5.2.1.  ATM Switch/Network/Host Support

          5.2.1.1.  ATM Switch/Network/Host Group

          5.2.1.1.1.  ATM VCL Statistics Table

          The atmVclStatTable is an extension to the atmVclTable.  It
          contains counters such as the cells received and cells
          transmitted per SVC or PVC.  These counters are defined as 32
          bit integers.  The implementation of this table is optional.

          5.2.1.2.  ATM Switch/Network/Host SVC Group

          5.2.1.2.1.  ATM Interface SVC Configuration Table

          This group contains information on the configuration of local
          ATM interfaces on an ATM device required to support SVCs in
          addition to those defined in the atmInterfaceConfTable of the
          ATM MIB [1] and those defined in RFC1573 [6].

          draft        Supplemental ATM Management Objects    March 1995


          Two important aspects of a local ATM interface that supports
          SVCs are the peak bandwidth assigned to the signalling virtual
          channel and signalling type used.  The signalling virtual
          channel is a point-to-point, bidirectional symmetric, virtual
          channel connection.  The range of peak bandwidth values is 173
          cells/sec to 3979 cells/sec, in steps of 173 cells/sec, with a
          default value of 173 cells/sec.  Using the ATM MIB [1] the
          signalling virtual channel bandwidth is assigned by creating a
          row in the ATM Traffic Descriptor Table which defines a Peak
          Cell Rate (PCR) which represents the signalling channel
          bandwidth.  Then using an entry in the atmVclTable [1],
          identify this row in the ATM Traffic Descriptor Table as the
          traffic descriptor for the signalling channel bandwidth.

          The signalling type defines the type of signalling supported
          at the local ATM interface (e.g., Q.2931 signalling).  The
          defined signalling types supported by this MIB include: Q.2931
          [11], ATM Forum's UNI 3.1 [10], and ATM Forum's P-NNI [12].

          This group contains a set of timers that do not have universal
          default values.  The following timers are supported by either
          Q.2931 [11], ATM Forum UNI 3.1 [10], or both:

          T302 Overlap Sending Timer:
               Applicable to both Hosts and Network Switches.  This
               timer starts when a SETUP ACKNOWLEDGE message is sent.
               The normal cause for stopping is when sending a complete
               indication, or network alert or connect request received.
               At first expiry clear if call information determined to
               be definitely incomplete; else send a CALL PROCEEDING.
               The range of this timer is defined in Q.2931 as 10-15
               seconds.  T302 is a Mandatory timer only if Q.2931
               Section 6.5 "Overlap Sending and Receiving" is
               implemented.  Note:  The ATM Forum UNI 3.1 [10] does not
               support this timer.

          T310 Outgoing Call Proceeding Timer:
               Applicable to both Hosts and Network Switches.  This
               timer starts when a CALL PROCEEDING message is received.
               The normal cause for stopping is when an ALERT, CONNECT,
               or RELEASE message is received.  At first expiry a
               RELEASE message is sent.  The range of this timer from 10
               to 120 seconds.  T310 is a Mandatory timer.  Q.2931
               recommends a default value of 30-120 seconds and the ATM
               Forums UNI 3.1 Specification recommends a default value

          draft        Supplemental ATM Management Objects    March 1995


               of 10 seconds.  Therefore, the range is between 10-120
               seconds.

          T317 Restart Timer:
               Applicable to both Hosts and Network Switches.  This
               timer starts when a RESTART message is received.  The
               normal cause for stopping this timer is when there is an
               internal clearing of call references.  At first expiry
               there is a maintenance notification.  T317 is a Mandatory
               timer. The range of this timer is less than the value of
               Timer T316 (i.e., less than 2 minutes).

          In addition to above timers, several other timers which are
          used by hosts and network switches are defined by either
          Q.2931, ATM Forum UNI 3.1, or both of them.  However, these
          timers have not been defined as managed objects since
          recommended default values can be used.  The timers not
          defined in this MIB fit into one of the following categories:
               1)  If the Timer is only supported by the ATM Forum
                   UNI 3.1, then use the ATM Forum UNI 3.1
                   Recommended default value for the timer.

               2)  If the Timer is only supported by Q.2931, then
                   use the Q.2931 Recommended default value for
                   the timer.

               3)  If the Timer is supported by ATM Forum UNI 3.1
                   and Q.2931, then use the common default value
                   for the timer.

          The following timers are not included in this MIB: T301, T303,
          T304, T306, T308, T309, T313, T316, T322, T398, T399.

          5.2.1.2.2.  SSCOP Table

          This group contains information on the ATM SSCOP signalling
          layer and must be supported by signalling entities.

          5.2.1.2.3.  Unsupported Service Failures Table

          This group contains information on the setup failures that
          occur when setting up an ATM SVC.  Maintaining counters for
          each individual signalling cause codes would result in a large
          number of counters.  Instead, this memo uses an approach that
          lumps events into three categories.  Three counters are used

          draft        Supplemental ATM Management Objects    March 1995


          to monitor connection failures occurring due to: 1)
          unavailable route, 2)  unavailable switch or network
          resources, or 3) the called party.  The counters are defined
          as follows:

                  1. Route Unavailable Counter

                     This counter maintains the number of
                     calls cleared because there was no
                     route unavailable to the destination.

                  2. Resources Unavailable Counter

                     This counter maintains the number of cleared
                     calls due to switch or network resources being
                     unavailable.

                  3. Called Party Counter

                     This counter maintains the number of cleared
                     calls caused by the called party (e.g.,
                     called party rejects the call).


          5.2.1.2.4.  ATM Signalling Layer Protocol Errors Table

          This group contains information on the Protocol Errors that
          occur at the signalling layer when establishing an ATM SVC.

          5.2.1.2.5.  UNI Signalling Sub-layer Statistics Table

          Configuration is needed per signalling entity in order to
          manage attributes of all SVCs set up by that entity.
          Signalling entities are not always bound one to one to ATM
          UNIs which is not always the case: a more flexible indexing
          mechanism would be to multiple signalling entities on a single
          UNI or vice versa - using ifIndex and VPI would provide
          sufficient flexibility here.

          Statistics per VCL are needed in order to find out the usage
          of VCL resources by ATM applications.  Additionally, to
          monitor the usage and health of an UNI signalling entity, some
          counters are needed per UNI signalling entity.  Two new
          objects are added to count the number of connections
          established.  One for incoming SVCs and one for outgoing SVCs.

          5.2.2.1.  ATM Switch/Network Group

          5.2.2.1.1.  ATM Interface Administrative Address Table

          This group is only supported by switches or networks for
          interfaces that have multiple associated addresses.  This
          group contains an ATM Interface Administrative Address Table
          (atmIfAdminAddrTable) which list up to 16 valid addresses for
          calls to and from a given interface.  One of these numbers
          shall be specified as the "default" number.  With screening,
          the Calling Party Number Information Element received in the
          SETUP message is checked by the switch or network to verify
          that it is one of the allowable addresses listed in the
          atmIfAdminAddrTable.

          5.2.2.2.  ATM Switch/Network SVC Group

          5.2.2.2.1.  ATM UNI SVC Subscription Features Table

          This group must be supported by switches or networks
          supporting SVCs.  The following subscription features for a
          UNI that supports ATM SVCs are contained in this group:

          1)   Calling party number delivery feature

          This parameter indicates whether the calling party number is
          delivered by the switch or network to the called address.
          (The calling party number is always delivered by the switch or
          network to the terminating switch, and this feature determines
          whether the number is delivered to the called party.)  The
          default value is 'disabled' which indicates that the feature
          is not active.

          2)   Calling party number screening feature

          This parameter indicates whether screening of a calling party
          number is supported by the switch or network.  If supported,
          the switch or network checks the calling party number received
          in the SETUP or ADD PARTY message to verify that it is one of
          the allowable calling party numbers.  (This list of allowable
          calling party numbers is located in the atmIfAdminAddrTable
          with up to 16 valid addresses per UNI.  One of these numbers
          shall be specified as the "default" number.)

          draft        Supplemental ATM Management Objects    March 1995


          If the received calling party number fails screening, the
          switch or network will replace the calling party number
          received in the SETUP or ADD PARTY message with the default
          number for the interface before forwarding this to the called
          party.  This will result in a completed call, but the
          delivered calling party number will not be the number
          indicated by the calling party.  Failed screening number
          events are monitored by the atmSubscrFeaturClgPtyFailScrCnts.
          The default value for this feature is 'enabled' which
          indicates that the screening is active.

          3)   Calling party subaddress transfer feature

          This parameter indicates whether the switch or network
          accepts, transfers, and delivers the Calling Party Subaddress
          Information Element received in the appropriate signalling
          message.  The default value is 'disabled' which indicates that
          the feature is not active.

          4)   Called party subaddress transfer feature

          This parameter indicates whether the switch or network
          accepts, transfers, and delivers the Called Party Subaddress
          Information Element received in the appropriate signalling
          message.  The default value is 'disabled' which indicates that
          the feature is not active.

          5)   High layer information transfer feature

          This parameter indicates whether the switch or network
          accepts, transfers, and delivers the Broadband High Layer
          Information Element received in the appropriate signalling
          message.  The default value is 'disabled' which indicates that
          the feature is not active.

          6)   Low layer information transfer feature

          This parameter indicates whether the switch or network
          accepts, transfers, and delivers Broadband Low Layer
          Information Element received in the appropriate signalling
          message.  The default value is 'disabled' which indicates that
          the feature is not active.

          7)   Low layer information selection feature

          accepts, transfers, and delivers up to three instances of the
          Broadband Low Layer Information Element for low layer
          information selection received in the appropriate signalling
          message.  The default value is 'disabled' which indicates that
          the feature is not active.  This parameter may be supplied
          only if the Low layer information transfer feature has a value
          of 'enabled'.

          8)   AAL parameter information transfer feature

          This parameter indicates whether the switch or network
          accepts, transfers, and delivers the ATM Adaptation Layer
          Parameters Information Element received in the appropriate
          signalling message.  The default value is 'disabled' which
          indicates that the feature is not active.

          9)   Preferred Carrier Presubscription

          This parameter identifies the carrier to which intercarrier
          calls originated from this interface are routed when transit
          network selection information is not provided by the calling
          party.

          5.2.3.1.  ATM Host Group

          5.2.3.1.1.  VCL Extension Table

          There can be two types of VCLs, Permanent VC or Switched VC
          used by ATM applications.  The ATM MIB [1] provides general
          connection management (atmVclTable).  This memo provides an
          extension to the atmVclTable which supports both SVC/PVC
          monitoring and PVC configuration capabilities.

          This table contains information needed for configuring PVCs
          and monitoring SVC/PVCs. It is an extension to the atmVclTable
          defined in the ATM MIB [1].

          The object Remote ATM address and Local ATM address describe
          the two endpoint addresses of a VCL.  Local ATM address
          represents the ATM endpoint at the end of the VCL represented
          by this agent. Remote ATM address represents the ATM
          application at the other end.

          draft        Supplemental ATM Management Objects    March 1995


          The object Connection Type is the type of the VCL, it is
          either a PVC, an incoming SVC or a outgoing SVC.  When
          creating an SVC, the agent can represent the VCL's attributes
          by selecting entries from two tables: the ATM Traffic
          Descriptor Parameter Table defined in the ATM MIB [1] and the
          ATM Signalling Descriptor Parameter Table defined in this
          memo.  For SVCs, the Signalling Descriptor index is used to
          point to an entry in the ATM Signalling Descriptor Parameter
          Table.

          5.2.3.1.2.  ATM Addresses to VCC Mapping Table

          Some ATM applications (e.g. LAN Emulation) use ATM endpoint
          addresses even over PVCs.  In order to trace SVC/PVCs between
          such ATM applications, it is important to be able to monitor
          VCLs (both SVCs and PVCs) indexed by their endpoint ATM
          addresses.  The atmVclAddrTable contains all VCCs currently
          active and is indexed by the remote ATM address. It is used in
          conjunction with the atmVclTable and the atmVclExtTable. Each
          entry in this table identifies an entry in the
          atmVclTable/atmVclExtTable.

          5.2.3.2.  ATM Host SVC Group

          5.2.3.2.1.  Signalling Parameter Descriptor Table

          This table extends the ATM VCL table of the ATM MIB [1] to
          include all other necessary signalling information as
          specified in both ATM Forum UNI Specifications [9] and [10].
          A user can create an entry with all signalling parameters and
          later use that entry to specify the signalling characteristics
          of SVCs.

          Signalling attributes can be grouped into following
          categories:

          1)   ATM Adaptation Layer Parameters

          Information in this group are captured in the ATM Signalling
          Descriptor Parameter Table defined in this memo.  Please refer
          to section 5.4.5.5 of [9] and [10].

          2)   Broadband Bearer Capability

          draft        Supplemental ATM Management Objects    March 1995


          Information in this group are captured by the ATM Signalling
          Descriptor Parameter Table defined in this memo.  Please refer
          to section 5.4.5.7 of [9] and [10].

          3)   Broadband High Layer Information

          Information in this group are captured by the ATM Signalling
          Descriptor Parameter Table defined in this memo.  Please refer
          to section 5.4.5.8 of [9] and [10].

          4)   Broadband Low Layer Information

          Information in this group are captured by the ATM Signalling
          Descriptor Parameter Table defined in this memo.  Please refer
          to section 5.4.5.9 of [9] and [10].


          6.  Valid Address Sets / Default Address

          A given ATM UNI interface may have an Address,
          "ifPhysAddress", to identify the interface.  In addition, a
          given ATM UNI  interface may have several other valid
          addresses which can be used to originate and receive calls.
          The valid addresses that are used to receive calls are listed
          in the "ifRcvAddrTable" defined in RFC1573 [6].  ATM
          interfaces of switches and networks do not use the
          ifRcvAddrTable.  Valid addresses to be used by a switch or
          network are listed in the ATM Interface Administrative Address
          Table.  The ATM Interface Administrative Address Table is not
          supported by hosts.


          7.  Configuration of VPLs, VCLs, and Cross-Connects

          The ATM Managed Objects needed to support the configuration of
          VPLs, VCLs, and Cross-Connects are defined in the ATM MIB [1].

                 calling party number received in a SETUP or ADD PARTY
                 message is enabled on the switch or network.  With
                 screening, the switch or network checks the Calling
                 Party Number Information Element in the received SETUP
                 or ADD PARTY message to verify that it is one of the
                 valid addresses listed in the atmInterfaceAdminAddress
                 defined in the ATM MIB [1] or the atmIfAdminAddrTable.
                 If the check fails the switch or network will replace
                 the calling party number with the default number for
                 the interface (atmInterfaceAdminAddress) before
                 forwarding this to the called party.  This will result
                 in a completed call, but the delivered calling party
                 number will not be the number desired by the calling
