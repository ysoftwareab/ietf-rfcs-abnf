1.  Introduction

   In multihomed and IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack environments ICE
   [I-D.ietf-ice-rfc5245bis] would benefit by a fair distribution of its
   connectivity checks across available interfaces or IP address types.
   With a fair distribution of the connectivity checks, excessive delays
   are avoided if a particular network path is broken or slow.  It would
   arguable be better to put the interfaces or address types know to the
   application last in the checklist.  However, the main motivation by
   ICE is to make no assumptions regarding network topology, hence a
   fair distribution of the connectivity checks is more appropriate.  If
   an application operates in a well-known environment is can safely
   override the recommendation given in this document.

   Applications should take special care to deprioritize network
   interfaces known to provide unreliable connectivity when operating in
   a multihomed environment.  For example, certain tunnel services might
   provide unreliable connectivity.  Doing so will ensure a more fair
   distribution of the connectivity checks across available network
   interfaces on the device.  The simple guidelines presented here
   describes how to deprioritize interfaces known by the application to
   provide unreliable connectivity.

   There is also a need to introduce more fairness when handling
   connectivity checks for different IP address families in dual-stack
   IPv4/IPv6 ICE scenarios.  Following the recommendations from RFC6724
   [RFC6724] will lead to prioritization of IPv6 over IPv4 for the same

   candidate type.  Due to this, connectivity checks for candidates of
   the same type (host, reflexive or relay) are sent such that an IP
   address family is completely depleted before checks from the other
   address family are started.  This results in user noticeable setup
   delays if the path for the prioritized address family is broken.

   To avoid such user noticeable delays when either IPv6 or IPv4 path is
   broken or excessively slow, this specification encourages
   intermingling the different address families when connectivity checks
   are performed.  Introducing IP address family fairness into ICE
   connectivity checks will lead to more sustained dual-stack IPv4/IPv6
   deployment as users will no longer have an incentive to disable IPv6.
   The cost is a small penalty to the address type that otherwise would
   have been prioritized.

   This document describes how to fairly order the candidates in
   multihomed and dual-stack environments, thus affecting the sending
   order of the connectivity checks.  If aggressive nomination is in
   use, this will have an effect on what candidate pair ends up as the
   active one.  Ultimately it should be up to the agent to decide what
   candidate pair is best suited for transporting media.

   The guidelines outlined in this specification are backward compatible
   with a standard ICE implementation.  This specification only alters
   the values used to create the resulting checklists in such a way that
   the core mechanisms from ICE [RFC5245] and ICEbis
   [I-D.ietf-ice-rfc5245bis] are still in effect.  The introduced
   fairness might be better, but not worse than what exists today.

2.  Notational Conventions

   This document uses terminology defined in [I-D.ietf-ice-rfc5245bis].

3.  Improving ICE Multihomed Fairness

   A multihomed ICE agent can potentially send and receive connectivity
   checks on all available interfaces and IP addresses.  It is possible
   for an interface to have several IP addresses associated with it.  To
   avoid unnecessary delay when performing connectivity checks it would
   be beneficial to prioritize interfaces and IP addresses known by the
   agent to provide stable connectivity.  If the agent has access to
   information about the physical network it is connected to (Like SSID
   in a WiFi Network) this can be used as information regarding how that
   network interface should be prioritized at this point in time.

   The application knowledge regarding the reliability of an interface
   can also be based on simple metrics like previous connection success/
   failure rates or a more static model based on interface types like



Martinsen, et al.       Expires December 12, 2016               [Page 3]

   wired, wireless, cellular, virtual, tunneled in conjunction with
   other operational metrics.  This would require the application to
   have the right permissions to obtain such operational metrics.

   Candidates from an interface known to the application to provide
   unreliable connectivity should get a low candidate priority.  This
   ensures they appear near the end of the candidate list, and would be
   the last to be tested during the connectivity check phase.  This
   allows candidate pairs more likely to succeed to be tested first.

   If the application is unable to get any interface information
   regarding type or unable to store any relevant metrics, it should
   treat all interfaces as if they have reliable connectivity.  This
   ensures all interfaces gets their fair chance to perform their
   connectivity checks.

4.  Improving ICE Dual Stack Fairness

   Candidates should be prioritized such that a sequence of candidates
   belonging to the same address family will be intermingled with
   candidates from an alternate IP family.  For example, promoting IPv4
   candidates in the presence of many IPv6 candidates such that an IPv4
   address candidate is always present after a small sequence of IPv6
   candidates, i.e., reordering candidates such that both IPv6 and IPv4
   candidates get a fair chance during the connectivity check phase.
   This makes ICE connectivity checks more responsive to broken path
   failures of an address family.

   An ICE agent can choose an algorithm or a technique of its choice to
   ensure that the resulting check lists have a fair intermingled mix of
   IPv4 and IPv6 address families.  However, modifying the check list
   directly can lead to uncoordinated local and remote check lists that
   result in ICE taking longer to complete or in the worst case scenario
   fail.  The best approach is to modify the formula for calculating the
   candidate priority value described in ICE [I-D.ietf-ice-rfc5245bis]
   section 4.1.2.1.

   Implementations should prioritize IPv6 candidates by putting some of
   them first in the intermingled checklist.  This increases the chance
   of IPv6 connectivity checks to complete first and be ready for
   nomination or usage.  This enables implementations to follow the
   intent of [RFC6555] "Happy Eyeballs: Success with Dual-Stack Hosts".
   It is worth noting that the timing recommendations in [RFC6555] are
   too excessive for ICE usage.

5.  Compatibility

   ICE [I-D.ietf-ice-rfc5245bis] section 4.1.2 states that the formula
   in section 4.1.2.1 should be used to calculate the candidate
   priority.  The formula is as follows:

    priority = (2^24)*(type
           preference) + (2^8)*(local preference) + (2^0)*(256 -
           component ID)

   ICE [I-D.ietf-ice-rfc5245bis] section 4.1.2.2 has guidelines for how
   the type preference and local preference value should be chosen.
   Instead of having a static local preference value for IPv4 and IPv6
   addresses, it is possible to choose this value dynamically in such a
   way that IPv4 and IPv6 address candidate priorities end up
   intermingled within the same candidate type.  It is also possible to
   assign lower priorities to IP addresses derived from unreliable
   interfaces using the local preference value.

   It is worth mentioning that [I-D.ietf-ice-rfc5245bis] section 4.1.2
   says that; "if there are multiple candidates for a particular
   component for a particular media stream that has the same type, the
   local preference MUST be unique for each one".

   The local type preference can be dynamically changed in such a way
   that IPv4 and IPv6 address candidates end up intermingled regardless
   of candidate type.  This is useful if there are a lot of IPv6 host
   candidates effectively blocking connectivity checks for IPv4 server
   reflexive candidates.

   Candidates with IP addresses from an unreliable interface should be
   ordered at the end of the checklist, i.e., not intermingled as the
   dual-stack candidates.

   The list below shows a sorted local candidate list where the priority
   is calculated in such a way that the IPv4 and IPv6 candidates are
   intermingled (No multihomed candidates).  To allow for earlier
   connectivity checks for the IPv4 server reflexive candidates, some of
   the IPv6 host candidates are demoted.  This is just an example of how
   a candidate priorities can be calculated to provide better fairness
   between IPv4 and IPv6 candidates without breaking any of the ICE
   connectivity checks.

                   SRFLX = server reflexive


   Note that the list does not alter the component ID part of the
   formula.  This keeps the different components (RTP and RTCP) close in
   the list.  What matters is the ordering of the candidates with
   component ID 1.  Once the checklist is formed for a media stream the
   candidate pair with component ID 1 will be tested first.  If ICE
   connectivity check is successful then other candidate pairs with the
   same foundation will be unfrozen ([I-D.ietf-ice-rfc5245bis] section
   5.1.3.4.  Computing States).

   The local and remote agent can have different algorithms for choosing
   the local preference and type preference values without impacting the
   synchronization between the local and remote check lists.

   The check list is made up of candidate pairs.  A candidate pair is
   two candidates paired up and given a candidate pair priority as
   described in [I-D.ietf-ice-rfc5245bis] section 5.1.3.2.  Using the
   pair priority formula:

        pair priority = 2^32*MIN(G,D) + 2*MAX(G,D) + (G>D?1:0)

Internet-Draft    ICE Multihomed and DualStack Fairness        June 2016


   Where G is the candidate priority provided by the controlling agent
   and D the candidate priority provided by the controlled agent.  This
   ensures that the local and remote check lists are coordinated.

   Even if the two agents have different algorithms for choosing the
   candidate priority value to get an intermingled set of IPv4 and IPv6
   candidates, the resulting checklist, that is a list sorted by the
   pair priority value, will be identical on the two agents.

   The agent that has promoted IPv4 cautiously i.e. lower IPv4 candidate
   priority values compared to the other agent, will influence the check
   list the most due to (2^32*MIN(G,D)) in the formula.

   These recommendations are backward compatible with a standard ICE
   implementation.  The resulting local and remote checklist will still
   be synchronized.  The introduced fairness might be better, but not
   worse than what exists today

   If aggressive nomination is in use the procedures described in this
   document might change what candidate pair ends up as the active one.

   A test implementation of an example algorithm is available at
   [ICE_dualstack_imp].
