1. Introduction 
    
   In order to generate unique address, an IPv6 node has to perform DAD 
   (Duplicate Address Detection) procedure when the IPv6 node tries to 
   make its own IPv6 address including link-local and global address.  
    
   Recently, some considerations are being suggested for optimized DAD 
   mechanisms to provide fast handover when a mobile node is connected 
   to the new networks. Real-time services require layer 3 handovers 
   between IPv6 networks to be completed quickly and with minimal packet 
   loss. All IPv6 nodes must perform DAD every time they handover 
   between IPv6 networks. DAD described in [3] is a time consuming 
   process, particularly when nodes in need of seamless handover run it. 
   During DAD time, any active communications of nodes are interrupted, 
   and this is especially unsuitable for real-time services.  
    
   This document clarifies the requirements for optimized DAD in IPv6 
   mobility. 
    
    
2. Intention / Scenario 
    
   The intention is to minimize address configuration delays in the 
   successful case without greatly increasing disruption in the less 
   likely failure case. Optimized DAD is a useful when a DAD is far more

   likely to succeed than fail for randomly autoconfigured addresses.  
   This makes it worth a little disruption in the failure case to 
   provide faster handovers in the successful case, as long as the 
   disruption is easily recoverable. 
    
    
3. Requirements for optimized DAD 
    
   The purpose of the optimized DAD mechanism is to provide faster 
   handovers in IPv6 mobility. 
    
    
3.1 Comparison with original DAD 
    
   When an original DAD is performed to verify address duplication, 
   there happened to be some delays (is defined in [3]) in this case. In 
   order to reduce delays, optimized DAD should be required to provide 
   faster handover in the IPv6 mobility. Though, at the same time, it 
   should be noted that the optimized DAD MUST NOT break the original 
   DAD mechanism. 
    
    
3.2 Neighbor Cache 
    
   The Neighbor Cache entries MUST NOT be modified in a way which is 
   unrecoverable through original DAD operation [3]. For effective 
   optimized DAD, there are no restrictive requirements to modify 
   Neighbor Cache entry in the specific cases. 
    
    
3.3 Host Modifications 
    
   The optimized DAD SHOULD allow for the use of original DAD and NDP 
   (Neighbor Discovery Protocol) to a host even if a host wants to be 
   modified for optimized DAD. For optimized DAD, a host including 
   neighbor MUST recognize modifications such as specific fields, flags, 
   values, etc. 
    
    
3.4 Router modifications 
    
   The optimized DAD SHOULD allow for the use of original DAD and NDP to 
   a router even if a router wants to be modified for optimized DAD. For 
   optimized DAD, a router MUST provide host requirements.

3.5 Security 
    
   The optimized DAD scheme SHOULD NOT introduce any new attacks on 
   Neighbor Discovery and the resulting schemes should be no worse than 
   existing DAD [3]. There are existing security concerns with Neighbor 
   Discovery and Stateless Address Autoconfiguration. These schemes 
   SHOULD interwork with Secure Neighbor DAD mechanisms as defined in 
   SEND WG. 
    
    
3.6 Address Duplication Considerations 
    
   In the simplest collision case, the address being configured by the 
   new node is already in use by another node, and present in the 
   Neighbor Caches of neighbors which are communicating with this node. 
   At this case, all nodes MUST detect address duplication either 
   original DAD or optimized DAD. 
    
    
3.7 Layer 2 Considerations 
    
   Generally, address duplication is happened to the same Interface ID 
   which is composed of 48bit/64bit MAC address. Therefore, when same 
   MAC address is existed in the same link, one of these nodes can not 
   make its IPv6 address using address autoconfiguration mechanism. At 
   this case, all nodes MUST be allowed to generate new addresses by 
   another mechanism. It should be clarified that the mechanisms should 
   be more discussed in the near future. 
    
    
4. IANA Considerations 
    
   There are no IANA considerations in this document. 
    
    
5. Security Considerations 
    
   Section 3.5 specifies security requirements for optimized DAD
