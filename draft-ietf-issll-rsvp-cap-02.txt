1. Abstract
   
   The resource reservation protocol [RSVP] is an end-to-end signaling 
   protocol and it can be a useful mechanism to carry the upstream node or 
   network capabilities/willingness to the downstream network/nodes.

   This draft proposes a capability negotiation object, CAP object, in the
   RSVP PATH message that can be used to convey end host/upstream node 
   capabilities to the downstream network/nodes. 
   

2. Introduction

   In today's heterogenous networking environment, it is important for each
   network to have a knowledge of its upstream nodes/network capabilities 
   before it can perform any actions to support the QoS requirements of the

   flows from upstream networks. Such an advance information would help the
   network operator to configure the network according to the expected 
   nature of traffic that the network devices have to process and route. 
   The current standards does not provide any way to the end host or 
   network devices to specify their capabilities to the downstream nodes. 
   The resource reservation protocol [RSVP] is an end-to-end signaling 
   protocol and has already been proposed in different scenarios to support
   end-to-end QoS [INTDIFF]. It can be a useful signaling mechanism to 
   carry the upstream node/network capabilities or willingness to the
   downstream network or nodes.  

   This draft proposes a capability negotiation object, The RSVP CAP 
   object, in the RSVP PATH message that can be used to convey end 
   host/upstream node capabilities/willingness to the downstream network. 
   This is a generic object that can be used to carry any meaningful 
   capability information in the RSVP PATH message.
     

3. Conventions used in this document 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-2119]. 


4. Format of CAP Object
    
   The CAP object has the following format:

              0       |       1       |       2       |       3
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |      Length                   |   C-Num (TBD) |      C-Type=1 |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                 	CAP field		              | 
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The CAP field is defined with full 32 bits in the object. Each bit in
   the field can be used for one specific capability representation. 


5. Message Processing Rules

5.1 Message Generation (RSVP Host)

   An RSVP PATH message is created as specified in [RSVP] with following
   modifications

     1. A capability (CAP) object is created and the CAP field is set to 
        indicate the various capabilities of the end host. Only those bits
        are set that represent a specific capability of the end host. The 
        bits that are unused MUST be left reset
     
   Hamid			Expires August, 2001	           [Page 2]
   draft-ietf-issll-rsvp-cap-02.txt	                     February, 2001

        An example;
          CAP field:

	  0x0X: A_Cap 
		The host/node capability/willingness identifier.
		If A_Cap bit is reset, the sender host/upstream node 
                does not have the capability
		If A_Cap bit is set, the sender host/upstream node does
                have the capability
        
          Note: A_Cap represents a single capability/willingness of the end 
                host/upstream network node 
    
     2. The CAP Object is inserted in the RSVP message in the appropriate
        place. 

5.2 Message Reception (Downstream Router)
   
   RSVP PATH message is processed at the downstream router as specified in
   [RSVP] with following modifications.

     1. The router records the CAP object as the micro-flow PATH state 

     2. The router modifies the CAP object by setting the CAP field to 
        reflect its own capabilities

5.3 Message Reception (Upstream Router)

   RSVP RESV message is processed at the upstream router as specified in 
   [RSVP] with following modifications.

     1. The router checks the recorded PATH state for the micro-flow and
        installs any rules required to handle the traffic

     2. If the router is not aware of the rules, it SHOULD seek the policy
        rules from the domain policy server
   
   
6. IANA Considerations

   The format of CAP object requires a class number (C-Num) in RSVP 
   message. Moreover, the capabilities defined through the CAP object 
   will be defined in other RFCs and their values will be assigned 
   through IANA.
