Internet-Draft        Problem with Sequence Number             June 2006


1.  Introduction

   Proxy Mobile IPv4 is a helpful solution which to provide mobility for
   mobile device with no MIP4 function [RFC3344].  The main idea of
   proxy Mobile IP is that an Mobile IPv4 entity, defined as Mobility
   Proxy Agent in this document, offers mobility service for a mobile
   device by initiating the MIP4 registration procedure on behalf of
   mobile device.

   In Proxy MIP4 solution [Proxy-MIP4], a new registration doesn't have
   sequence number and re-registration containes sequence number
   assigned by Home Agent(HA).  Hence HA can distinguish a new
   registration from stale registrations generated by previous Mobility
   Proxy Agent.

   However, such sequence number cannot prevent registration message
   from replay attack.  An attacker can intercept previous new
   registration and replay it to HA.  Then HA will be deceived by the
   replayed registration and bind a wrong care-of address for mobile
   device.


2.  Terminology

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119].

   The following new terminology and abbreviations are introduced in
   this document and all other general mobility related terms as defined
   in Mobile IPv4 specification [RFC3543].

   Mobile Station (MS)

      Any IPv4 node that has the ability to physically access or roam
      across different networks.  The Mobile Station does not
      necessarily have the Mobile IPv4 protocol stack.

   Mobility Proxy Agent (MPA)

      The Mobile IPv4 entity that offers proxy mobility service for a
      Mobile Station by performing registration function on the host's
      behalf.  It may be the Access Point, Base Station, Mobile
      Terminal, Access Router, or Access Gateway.

   Figure 1: Sequence Maintenance in Proxy Mobile IPv4

   The using of sequence number in Proxy MIP4 [Proxy-MIP4] is
   illustrated in figure 1.  When MPA is attached to MPA1, MPA1 will
   send Registration Request with no sequence number on MS's
   behalf(step1).  HA assigns a sequence number 'X' in the Registration
   Reply.  Subsequent registration requests from MPA1 contains the
   sequence number.  After MS moves and connects with MPA2, MPA2 will
   send proxy Registration Request with no sequence number to HA(step4).
   And HA returns back a sequence number 'X+1' in the Registration
   Reply.  Subsequent registration requests from MPA2 contains the
   sequence number 'X+1'.  By checking the sequence number in the
   registration message, HA knows which registration is new and ignore
   stale registrations.

   If a malicious node intercepts previous Registration Request from
   MPA1, the malicious node can replay the intercepted message to HA

   after MS connecting with MPA2.  In this case, HA will be cheated that
   it receives a new Registration Request from MPA1 and hence change the
   care-of address of MS to IP address of MPA1 even though MS is
   connected with MPA2.

   Therefore only sequence number cannot prevent Registration Request
   from Replay Attack.  When a malicious node intercepts previous
   registrations and replays it to home agent, home agent will have a
   wrong binding for MS.

   Even if timestamp is used as sequence number, the problem still
   cannot be addressed.  Unlike in base Mobile IPv4 in which
   Registration Request is generated by MS, it is MPA that generates
   Registration Request message.  Unless that the machine time in two
   MPAs are exactly synchronized, Home Agent doesn't know the sequence
   of these registrations from different MPAs.  And HA doesn't know
   whether a registration message is a replayed message or a valid one.


4.  Security Considerations

   The security problem when using sequence number for anti-replay
   purpose can be addressed by later solutions.
