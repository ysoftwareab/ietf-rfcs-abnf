2. Abstract

   The current RSVP-TE specification, "RSVP-TE: Extensions to RSVP for
   LSP Tunnels" (RFC 3209) and GMPLS extensions to RSVP-TE, "Generalized
   Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Resource ReserVation
   Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) Extensions" (RFC 3473) allow
   abstract nodes and resources to be explicitly included in a path
   setup, but not to be explicitly excluded.

   In some systems where precise explicit paths are not computed at the
   head end it may be useful to specify and signal abstract nodes and
   resources that are to be explicitly excluded from routes.  These
   exclusions may apply to the whole of a path, or to parts of a path
   between two abstract nodes specified in an explicit route.

   Shared Risk Link Groups (SRLGs) allow the definition of resources or
   groups of resources that share the same risk of failure.  The
   knowledge of SRLGs may be used to compute diverse paths that can be
   used for protection.  In systems where it is useful to signal
   exclusions, it may be useful to signal SRLGs to indicate groups of
   resources that should be excluded on the whole of a path or between
   two abstract nodes specified in an explicit path.

   This document specifies ways to communicate route exclusions during
   path setup using RSVP-TE.

2.1 Future Work

   Future work on this document may include the following.

   - Addition of further examples and explanation of the applicability
     of route exclusion.

   - reduction of the length of the XRO and EXRS subobjects

   - Identification of the scope of relevance of exclusions so that
     they may be omited from signaled messages, or at least from path
     computations, when they are not relevant.

   - Exclusion of unnumbered links.

   - Convergence of SRLG identification with formats defined in other
     drafts.

4. Overview

   The current RSVP-TE specification [RSVP-TE] and GMPLS extensions
   [GMPLS-RSVP-TE] allow abstract nodes and resources to be explicitly
   included in a path setup, using the Explicit Route Object (ERO).

   In some systems it may be useful to specify and signal abstract nodes
   and resources that are to be explicitly excluded from routes. This
   may be because loose hops or abstract nodes need to be prevented from
   causing a route through a specific resource. This is a special case
   of path calculation distribution to nodes within the system.

   Two types of exclusions are required:

   i)  Do not include any of the abstract nodes in a given set anywhere
       on the path.  This set of abstract nodes to exclude is referred
       to as the Exclude Route list.

   ii) Do not include certain abstract nodes or resources between a
       specific pair of abstract nodes present in an ERO.  Such specific
       exclusions are referred to as Explicit Exclusion Route.

   To convey these constructs within the signaling protocol, a new RSVP
   object and a new ERO subobject are introcuded respectively.

   i)  A new RSVP-TE object is introduced to convey the Exclude Route
       list.  This object is the Exclude Route Object (XRO).

   ii) The second type of exclusion is achieved through a modification
       to the existing ERO.  A new subobject type the Explicit Exclude
       Route Subobject (EXRS) is introduced to indicate an exclusion
       between a pair of included abstract nodes.

   SRLGs allow the definition of resources or groups of resources that
   share the same risk of failure.  The knowledge of SRLGs may be used
   to compute diverse paths that can be used for protection.  In systems
   where it is useful to signal exclusions, it may be useful to signal
   SRLGs to indicate groups of resources that should be excluded on the
   whole of a path or between two abstract nodes specified in an
   explicit path.

   This document introduces an ERO subobject to indicate an SRLG to be
   signaled in either of the two exclusion methods described above. This
   subobject might also be appropriate for use within Explicit Routes or
   Record Routes, but that discussion is outside the scope of this
   document.

4.1 Scope of Excluded Routes

   This document does not preclude a route exclusion from listing many
   nodes or network elements to avoid. The intent is, however, to
   indicate only the minimal number of subobjects to be avoided.  For
   instance it may be necessary to signal only the  SRLGs (or Shared
   Risk Groups) to avoid.

   It is envisaged most of the conventional inclusion subobjects are
   specified in the signaled ERO only for the area where they pertain.
   The number of subobjects to be avoided, specified in the signaled XRO
   may be constant throughout the whole path setup, or the subobjects to
   be avoided may be removed from the XRO as they become irrelevant in
   the subsequent hops of the path setup.

   For example, consider an LSP that traverses multiple computation
   domains.  A computation domain may be an area in the administrative
   or IGP sense, or may be an arbitrary division of the network for
   active management and path computational pruposes. Let the primary
   path be (Ingress A1,A2,AB1,B1,B2,BC1,C1,C2,Egress1) where Xn denotes
   a node in domain X, and XY1 denotes a node on the border of domain X
   and domain Y.  Ingress is a node in cdomain A, and Egress is a node
   in domain C.

   Consider the establishment of a node diverse protection path. The
   protection path must avoid all nodes on the primary path.
   The exclusions for area A are handled during CSPF at Ingress, so the
   ERO and XRO signaled at Ingress (A3-strict, A4-strict, AB2-strict,
   Egress-loose) and (B1, B2, BC1, C1, C2) respectively.  At AB2 the ERO
   and XRO could be (B3-strict, B4-strict, BC2-strict, Egress-loose) and
   (C1,C2) respectively.  At BC2 the ERO could be (C3-strict, C4-strict,
   Egress-strict) and an XRO is not needed from BC2 onwards.

   In general, consideration should be given (as with explicit route) to
   the size of signaled data and the impact on the signaling protocol.

4.2 Relationship to MPLS TE MIB

   [MPLS-TE-MIB] defines managed objects for managing and modeling MPLS-
   based traffic engineering. Included in [MPLS-TE-MIB] is a means to
   configure explicit routes for use on specific LSPs. This
   configuration allows the exclusion of certain resources.


Lee, Farrel, De Cnodder                                         [Page 3]

draft-ietf-ccamp-rsvp-te-exclude-route-00.txt                  June 2003

   In systems where the full explicit path is not computed at the
   ingress (or at a path computation site for use at the ingress) it may
   be necessary to signal those exclusions. This document offers a means
   of doing this signaling.

5. Shared Risk Link Groups

   The identifier of a SRLG is defined as a 32 bit quantity in [GMPLS-
   OSPF].  These 32 bits are divided into an 8 bit type field and a 24
   bit identifier in [CCAMP-SRLG].

5.1 SRLG ERO Subobject

   The format of the ERO and its subobjects are defined in [RSVP-TE].

   The new SRLG subobject is defined by this document as follows.

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |L|    Type     |     Length    |   Tolerance   |    Reserved   |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |    SRLG Id                                                    |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

         L

            The L bit is an attribute of the subobject.  The L bit is set
            if the subobject represents a loose hop in the explicit route.
            If the bit is not set, the subobject represents a strict hop in
            the explicit route.

            For exclusions, the L bit SHOULD be set to zero and ignored.

         Type

            The type of the subobject [TBD].

         Length

            The Length contains the total length of the subobject in bytes,
            including the Type and Length fields.  The Length is always 8.

         Tolerance

            The level to which it is permissible for this SRLG to be
            included in the path when more than one SRLG is specified.
            A value of zero indicates that this SRLG MUST be avoided.  A
            tolerance value of n < m indicates that the SRLG MUST be
            avoided in preference to an SRLG with tolerance value m.

            If only one SRLG is present, then a value other than zero
            indicates the SRLG SHOULD be avoided.

         SRLG Id

            The 32 bit identifier of the SRLG.

draft-ietf-ccamp-rsvp-te-exclude-route-00.txt                  June 2003

5.2 Exclusion Tolerance Semantics

   The Tolerance field in the SRLG subobject indicates the degree to
   which the SRLG must be avoided. (The degree to which it is
   permissible to include it.)

   If the Tolerance field has the value zero (0), the LSP MUST NOT
   traverse or use any resource that is a member of the SRLG.

   If the value is non-zero, all path computation elements SHOULD
   attempt to select routes that avoid all resources that are members of
   the SRLG.

   Where more than one SRLG with non-zero Tolerance value is specified
   for exclusion and no route can be found that avoids both SRLGs, a
   route SHOULD be chosen that avoids the SRLG with the lower Tolerance
   value.

6. Exclude Route List

   The exclude route identifies a list of abstract nodes that MUST NOT
   be traversed along the path of the LSP being established.

6.1 Exclude Route Object (XRO)

   Abstract nodes to be excluded from the path are specified via the
   EXCLUDE_ROUTE object (XRO).  The Exclude Route Class value is [TBD].

   Currently one C_Type is defined, Type 1 Exclude Route.  The
   EXCLUDE_ROUTE object has the following format:

   Class = TBD, C_Type = 1

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                                                               |
      //                        (Subobjects)                          //
      |                                                               |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


      Subobjects

      The contents of an EXCLUDE_ROUTE object are a series of variable-
      length data items called subobjects.  The subobjects are identical
      to those defined in [RSVP-TE] and [GMPLS-RSVP-TE] for use in EROs.

      The following subobject types are supported.

                   Type   Subobject
                      1   IPv4 prefix
                      2   IPv6 prefix
                     32   Autonomous system number
                    TBD   SRLG

draft-ietf-ccamp-rsvp-te-exclude-route-00.txt                  June 2003

   The defined values for Type above are specified in [RSVP-TE] and in
   this document.

   The concept of loose or strict hops has no meaning in route
   exclusion.  The L bit, defined for ERO subobjects in [RSPV-TE], is
   re-used here to indicate that an abstract node MUST be avoided
   (value 0) or SHOULD be avoided (value 1).

   An Attribute octet is introduced in the subobjects that define IP
   addresses to indicate the attribute (e.g. interface, node, SRLG)
   associated with the IP addresses that can be excluded from the
   path. For instance, the attribute node allows a whole node to be
   excluded from the path, in contrast to the attribute interface,
   which allows specific interfaces to be excluded from the path.
   The attribute SRLG allows all SRLGs associated with an IP
   address to be excluded from the path.

       0                   1                   2                   3

6.2. Semantics and Processing Rules for the Exclude Route Object (XRO)

   The exclude route list is encoded as a series of subobjects contained
   in an EXCLUDE_ROUTE object.  Each subobject identifies an abstract
   node in the exclude route list.

   Each abstract node may be a precisely specified IP address a node, or
   an IP address with prefix identifying interfaces of a group of nodes,
   or an Autonomous System.

   The Explicit Route and routing processing is unchanged from the
   description in [RSVP-TE] with the following additions:

   a. When a Path message is received at a node, the node must check
      that it is not a member of any of the abstract nodes in the XRO if
      it is present in the Path message.  If the node is a member of any
      of the abstract nodes in the XRO it should return a PathErr with
      the error code "Routing Problem" and error value of "Local node in
      Exclude Route".  If there are SRLGs in the XRO, the node should
      check that it and the resources it uses are not part of any SRLG
      that is specified with Tolerance value of zero.  If it is, it

      should return a PathErr with the error code "Routing Problem" and
      error value of "Local node in Exclude Route".  The node may be a
      member of an SRLG in the XRO that is specified with a non-zero
      Tolerance value.

   b. When choosing a next hop or expanding an explicit route to include
      additional subobjects, a node:

      i)  must not introduce an explicit node or an abstract node that
          equals or is a member of any abstract node that is specified
          in the Exclude Route Object.

      ii) must not (or should not, in the case of a non-zero Tolerance
          value) introduce links, nodes or resources identified by the
          SRLG ID specified in the SRLG subobjects(s).  If these rules
          preclude further forwarding of the Path message, the node
          should return a PathErr with the error code "Routing Problem"
          and error value of "Route blocked by Exclude Route".

   c. The subobjects in the ERO and XRO SHOULD not contradict each
      other. If they do contradict, the subobjects with the L bit not
      set, strict or MUST be excluded, respectively, in the ERO or XRO
      MUST take precedence.  If there is still a conflict, the
      subobjects in the ERO MUST take precedence.

   The XRO Class-Num is of the form 11bbbbbb so that nodes which do not
   support the XRO will forward it uninspected and will not apply the
   extensions to ERO processing described above.  This makes the XRO a
   'best effort' process.

   This 'best-effort' approach is chosen to allow route exclusion to
   traverse parts of the network that are not capable of parsing or
   handling the new function.  Note that Record Route may be used to
   allow computing nodes to observe violations of route exclusion and
   attempt to re-route the LSP accordingly.

7. Explicit Exclude Route

   The Explicit Exclude Route defines abstract nodes or resources (such
   as links, unnumbered interfaces or labels) that must not be used on
   the path between two inclusive abstract nodes or resources in the
   explicit route.

7.1. Explicit Exclusion Route Subobject (EXRS)

   A new ERO subobject type is defined.  The Explicit Exclude Route
   Subobject (EXRS) has type [TBD].  The EXRS may not be present in
   an RRO or XRO.

   The format of the EXRS is as follows.

       0                   1

        EXRS subobjects
           An EXRS subobject indicates the abstract node or resource to
           be excluded.  The format of this field is exactly the format of
           an XRO subobject and may include an SRLG subobject. Both
           subobjects are as described earlier in this document.

      Thus, an EXRO subobject for an IP hop might look as follows:

       0                   1                   2                   3

      | IPv4 address (4 bytes)                                        |

      | Prefix Length |   Attribute   |          Reserved             |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Note: The Most Significant Bit in the Type field could be used to
   indicate exclusion of IPv4/IPv6, AS and SRLG subobjects, eliminating
   the need to prepend the subobject with an additional TLV header.
   This would reduce the number bytes require for each subobject by 2
   bytes. However, this approach would reduce the ERO Type field space by
   half. This issue need WG discussion and feedback.

7.2. Semantics and Processing Rules for the EXRS

   Each EXRS may carry multiple exclusions. The exclusion is encoded
   exactly as for XRO subobjects and prefixed by an additional Type and
   Length.

   The scope of the exclusion is the step between the previous ERO
   subobject that identifies an abstract node, and the subsequent ERO
   subobject that identifies an abstract node.  Multiple exclusions may
   be present between any pair of abstract nodes.

   Exclusions may indicate explicit nodes, abstract nodes or Autonomous
   Systems that must not be traversed on the path to the next abstract
   node indicated in the ERO.

   Exclusions may also indicate resources (such as unnumbered
   interfaces, link ids, labels) that must not be used on the path to
   the next abstract node indicated in the ERO.

   SRLGs may also be indicated for exclusion from the path to the next
   abstract node in the ERO by the inclusion of an EXRO Subobject
   containing an SRLG subobject. If the Tolerance value in the SRLG
   subobject is zero, the resources (nodes, links, etc.)  identified by
   the SRLG must not be used on the path to the next abstract node
   indicated in the ERO.  If the Tolerance value is non- zero, the
   resources identified by the SRLG should be avoided, but may be used
   in preference to resources associated with another SRLG indicated for
   exclusion if that SRLG has a (numerically) lower Tolerance value.

   The subobjects in the ERO and EXRS SHOULD not contradict each other.
   If they do contradict, the subobjects with the L bit not set, strict
   or MUST be excluded, respectively, in the ERO or XRO MUST take
   precedence.  If there is still a conflict, the subobjects in the ERO
   MUST take precedence.

   If a node is called upon to process an EXRS and does not support
   handling of exclusions it will return a PathErr with a "Bad
   EXPLICIT_ROUTE object" error.

   If the presence of EXRO Subobjects precludes further forwarding of
   the Path message, the node should return a PathErr with the error
   code "Routing Problem" and error value of "Route blocked by Exclude
   Route".

8. Security

   The new exclude route object poses no security exposures over and
   above [RSVP-TE] and [GMPLS-RSVP-TE].  Note that any security concerns
   that exist with Explicit Routes should be considered with regard to
   route exclusions.

9. IANA Considerations

9.1. New Class Numbers

   One new class number is required.

   EXCLUDE_ROUTE
       Class-Num = 011bbbbb
       CType: 1

9.2. New Subobject Types

   A new subobject type for the Exclude Route Object and Explicit
   Exclude Route Subobject is required.

      SRLG subobject

   A new subobject type for the ERO is required.

      Explicit Exclude Route subobject

9.3. New Error Codes

   New error values are needed for the error code 'Routing Problem'.

   Unsupported Exclude Route Subobject Type [TBD]
   Local Node in Exclude Route              [TBD]
   Route Blocked by Exclude Route           [TBD]
