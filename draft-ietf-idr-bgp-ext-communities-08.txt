1. Introduction

   The Extended Community Attribute provides two important enhancements
   over the existing BGP Community Attribute:

      - It provides an extended range, ensuring that communities can be
        assigned for a plethora of uses, without fear of overlap.

      - The addition of a Type field provides structure for the
        community space.

   The addition of structure allows the usage of policy based on the
   application for which the community value will be used. For example,
   one can filter out all communities of a particular type, or allow
   only certain values for a particular type of community. It also
   allows one to specify whether a particular community is transitive or
   non-transitive across Autonomous system boundary. Without structure,
   this can only be accomplished by explicitly enumerating all community
   values which will be denied or allowed and passed to BGP speakers in
   neighboring ASes based on the transitive property.


2. BGP Extended Communities Attribute

   The Extended Communities Attribute is a transitive optional BGP
   attribute, with the Type Code 16.  The attribute consists of a set of
   "extended communities".  All routes with  the Extended Communities
   attribute belong to the communities listed in the attribute.

   Each Extended Community is encoded as an eight octet quantity, as
   follows:

      - Type Field  : 1 or 2 octets
      - Value Field : Remaining octets


       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |  Type high    |  Type low(*)  |                               |

      |                                                               |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      *) Present for Extended types only, used for the Value field
         otherwise

      Type Field:

         Two classes of Type Field are introduced: Regular type and
         Extended type.

         The size of Type Field for Regular types is 1 octet and the
         size of the Type Field for Extended types is 2 octets.

         The value of the high-order octet of the Type Field determines
         if an extended community is a Regular type or an Extended type.

         The high-order octet of the Type Field is as shown below:


             0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
            |I|T|           |
            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


            I - IANA authority bit

               Value 0: IANA assignable type using the "First Come First
               Serve" policy

               Value 1: IANA assignable type using the IETF Consensus
               policy and experimental

            T - Transitive bit

               Value 0: The community is transitive across ASes

               Value 1: The community is non-transitive across ASes

            Remaining 6 bits: Indicates the structure of the community

      Value Field:

         The encoding of the Value Field is dependent on the "type" of
         the community as specified by the Type Field.

   Two extended communities are declared equal only when all 8 octets of
   their encoding are equal.

   The two members in the tuple <Type, Value> should be enumerated to
   specify any community value. Based on the value of the Type field,
   the remaining octets of the community should be interpreted.

3. Defined BGP Extended Community Types

   This section introduces a few extended types and defines the format
   of the Value Field for those types. The types introduced here provide
   "templates", where each template is identified by the high order
   octet of the extended community Type field, and the lower order octet
   (sub-type) is used to indicate a particular type of extended commu-
   nity.


3.1. Two-octet AS specific extended community

   This is an extended type with Type Field comprising of 2 octets and
   Value Field comprising of 6 octets.


      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |                     Local Administrator                       |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   The value of the high-order octet of this extended type is either
   0x00 or 0x40. The low-order octet of this extended type is used to
   indicate sub-types.

   The Value Field consists of two sub-fields:

      Global Administrator sub-field: 2 octets

         This sub-field contains an Autonomous System number assigned by
         IANA.

      Local Administrator sub-field: 4 octets

         The organization identified by Autonomous System number in the
         Global Administrator sub-field, can encode any information in
         this sub-field.  The format and meaning of the value encoded in
         this sub-field should be defined by the sub-type of the commu-
         nity.

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   The value of the high-order octet of this extended type is either
   0x01 or 0x41. The low-order octet of this extended type is used to
   indicate sub-types.

   The Value field consists of two sub-fields:

      Global Administrator sub-field: 4 octets

         This sub-field contains an IPv4 address assigned by IANA.

      Local Administrator sub-field: 2 octets

         The organization which has been assigned the IPv4 address in
         the Global Administrator sub-field, can encode any information
         in this sub-field.  The format and meaning of this value
         encoded in this sub-field should be defined by the sub-type of
         the community.

         This sub-field contains a 4-octets Autonomous System number
         assigned by IANA.

      Local Administrator sub-field: 2 octets

         The organization identified by Autonomous System number in the
         Global Administrator sub-field, can encode any information in
         this sub-field.  The format and meaning of the value encoded in
         this sub-field should be defined by the sub-type of the commu-
         nity.

4. Route Target Community

   The Route Target Community identifies one or more routers that may
   receive a set of routes (that carry this Community) carried by BGP.
   This is transitive across the Autonomous system boundary.

   The Route Target Community is of an extended type.

   The value of the high-order octet of the Type field for the Route
   Target Community can be 0x00, 0x01 or 0x02. The value of the low-
   order octet of the Type field for this community is 0x02.

   When the value of the high-order octet of the Type field is 0x00 or
   0x02, the Local Administrator sub-field contains a number from a num-
   bering space which is administered by the organization to which the
   Autonomous System number carried in the Global Administrator subfield
   has been assigned by an appropriate authority.

   When the value of the high-order octet of the Type field is 0x01, the
   Local Administrator sub-field contains a number from a numbering
   space which is administered by the organization to which the IP
   address carried in the Global Administrator subfield has been
   assigned by an appropriate authority.


5. Route Origin Community

   The Route Origin Community identifies one or more routers that inject
   a set of routes (that carry this Community) into BGP. This is transi-
   tive across the Autonomous system boundary.

   The Route Origin Community is of an extended type.

   The value of the high-order octet of the Type field for the Route
   Origin Community can be 0x00, 0x01 or 0x02. The value of the low-
   order octet of the Type field for this community is 0x03.

   When the value of the high-order octet of the Type field is 0x00 or
   0x02, the Local Administrator sub-field contains a number from a num-
   bering space which is administered by the organization to which the
   Autonomous System number carried in the Global Administrator subfield
   has been assigned by an appropriate authority.

   When the value of the high-order octet of the Type field is 0x01, the
   Local Administrator sub-field contains a number from a numbering
   space which is administered by the organization to which the IP
   address carried in the Global Administrator subfield has been
   assigned by an appropriate authority.

6. Link Bandwidth Community

   When a router receives a route from a directly connected external
   neighbor (the external neighbor that is one IP hop away), and adver-
   tises this route (via IBGP) to internal neighbors, as part of this
   advertisement the router may carry the bandwidth of the link that
   connects the router with the external neighbor. The bandwidth of such
   a link is carried in the Link Bandwidth Community.

   The Link Bandwidth Community is of an extended type.

   The value of the high-order octet of the Type Field is 0x00.  The
   value of the low-order octet of the Type field for this community is
   0x04.

   The value of the Global Administrator sub-field in the Value Field
   MUST represent the Autonomous System of the router that attaches the
   Link Bandwidth Community.

   The bandwidth of the link is expressed as 4 octets in IEEE floating
   point format, units being bytes per second. It is carried in the
   Local Administrator sub-field of the Value Field.


7. Operations

   A BGP speaker may use the Extended Communities attribute to control
   which routing information it accepts or distributes to its peers.

   The Extended Community attribute MUST NOT be used to modify the BGP
   best path selection algorithm in a way that leads to forwarding
   loops.

   A BGP speaker receiving a route that doesn't have the Extended Commu-
   nities attribute MAY append this attribute to the route when propa-
   gating it to its peers.

   A BGP speaker receiving a route with the Extended Communities
   attribute MAY modify this attribute according to the local policy.

   By default if a range of routes is to be aggregated and the resultant
   aggregates path attributes do not carry the ATOMIC_AGGREGATE
   attribute, then the resulting aggregate should have an Extended Com-
   munities path attribute which contains the set union of all the
   Extended Communities from all of the aggregated routes. The default
   behavior could be overriden via local configuration, in which case
   handling the Extended Communities attribute in the presence of route
   aggregation becomes a matter of the local policy of the BGP speaker



Sangli, Tappan, Rekhter                                         [Page 9]





Internet Draft  draft-ietf-idr-bgp-ext-communities-08.txt  February 2005


   that performs the aggregation.

   If a route has a non-transitivity extended community, then before
   advertising the route across the Autonomous system boundary the com-
   munity SHOULD be removed from the route. However, the community
   SHOULD NOT be removed when advertising the route across the BGP Con-
   federation boundary.

   A route may carry both the BGP Communities attribute  as defined in
   [RFC1997]), and the Extended BGP Communities attribute. In this case
   the BGP Communities attribute is handled as specified in [RFC1997],
   and the Extended BGP Communities attribute is handled as specified in
   this document.


8. IANA Considerations

   All the BGP Extended Communities contain a Type field for which IANA
   is to create and maintain a registry entitled BGP Extended Communi-
   ties Type.

   The Type could be either regular or extended. For a regular Type the
   IANA allocates an 8-bits value; for an extended Type the IANA allo-
   cates a 16-bits value.

   The value allocated for a regular Type MUST NOT be reused as the
   value of the high-order octet when allocating an extended Type.  The
   value of the high-order octet allocated for an extended Type MUST NOT
   be reused when allocating a regular Type.

   The Type field indicates where the Extended Community is transitive
   or not.

   Future assignment are to be made using either the Standards Action
   process defined in [RFC2434], or the Early IANA Allocation process
   defined in [kompella-zinin], or the "First Come First Served" policy
   defined in [RFC2434].

   The following table summarizes the ranges for the assignment of
   Types:

      Type                        Standard Action         First Come
                                  Early IANA Allocation   First Served

      regular, transitive          0x90-0xbf              0x00-x3f

      regular, non-transitive      0xd0-0xff              0x40-0x7f

      extended, non-transitive     0xd000-0xffff          0x4000-0x7fff

   Assignments consist of a name and the value.

   The Type values 0x80-0x8f and 0xc0-0xcf for regular Types, and
   0x8000-0x8fff and 0xc000-0xcfff for extended Types are experimental,
   and are not to be assigned by IANA.

   This document defines a class of extended communities called two-
   octet AS specific extended community for which the IANA is to create
   and maintain a registry entitled Two-octet AS Specific Extended Com-
   munity.  All the communities in this class are of extended Types.
   Future assignment are to be made using the "First Come First Served"
   policy defined in [RFC2434]. The Type values for the transitive com-
   munities of the two-octet AS specific extended community class are
   0x0000-0x00ff, and for the non-transitive communities of that class
   are 0x4000-0x40ff.  Assignments consist of a name and the value.

   This document makes the following assignments for the two-octet AS
   specific extended community:

      Name                                     Type Value
      ----                                     ----------

      two-octet AS specific Route Origin       0x0003
      two-octet AS specific Link Bandwidth     0x0004

   This document defines a class of extended communities called IPv4
   address specific extended community for which the IANA is to create
   and maintain a registry entitled IPv4 Address Specific Extended
   Community. All the communities in this class are of extended Types.
   Future assignment are to be made using the "First Come First Served"
   policy defined in [RFC2434]. The Type values for the transitive
   communities of the two-octet AS specific extended community class
   are 0x0100-0x01ff, and for the non-transitive communities of that
   class are 0x4100-0x41ff. Assignments consist of a name and the
   value.

   This document makes the following assignments for the IPv4 address
   specific extended community:

      Name                                     Type Value

   This document defines a class of extended communities called
   four-octet AS specific extended community for which the IANA is to
   create and maintain a registry entitled Four-octet AS Specific
   Extended Community. All the communities in this class are of
   extended Types. Future assignment are to be made using the "First
   Come First Served" policy defined in [RFC2434]. The Type values for
   the transitive communities of the two-octet AS specific extended
   community class are 0x0200-0x02ff, and for the non-transitive
   communities of that class are 0x4200-0x42ff. Assignments consist
   of a name and the value.

   This document makes the following assignments for the four-octet
   AS specific extended community:

      Name                                     Type Value
      ----                                     ----------
      four-octet AS specific Route Target       0x0202
      four-octet AS specific Route Origin       0x0203

   This document defines a class of extended communities called opaque
   extended community for which the IANA is to create and maintain a
   registry entitled Opaque Extended Community. All the communities
   in this class are of extended Types. Future assignment are to be
   made using the "First Come First Served" policy defined in [RFC2434].
   The Type values for the transitive communities of the opaque extended
   community class are 0x0300-0x03ff, and for the non-transitive
   communities of that class are 0x4300-0x43ff. Assignments consist
   of a name and the value.

   When requesting an allocation from more than one registry defined
   above, one may ask for allocating the same Type value from
   these registries. If possible, the IANA should accommodate such
   requests.


9. Security Considerations

   This extension to BGP does not change the underlying security issues.
