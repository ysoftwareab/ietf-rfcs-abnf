1.  Introduction

   AsciiRFC [I-D.ribose-asciirfc] is an extremely simple way to author
   Internet-Drafts and RFCs without needing to manually craft RFC XML
   [RFC7991].

   This is a template for authors to easily start with
   [I-D.ribose-asciirfc].

2.  Terms and Definitions

   The key words "*MUST*", "*MUST NOT*", "*REQUIRED*", "*SHALL*",
   "*SHALL NOT*", "*SHOULD*", "*SHOULD NOT*", "*RECOMMENDED*", "*NOT
   RECOMMENDED*", "*MAY*", and "*OPTIONAL*" in this document are to be
   interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only
   when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

3.  Symbols And Abbreviations

3.1.  Operators

   AsciiRFC
      As defined in [I-D.ribose-asciirfc].

4.  Security Considerations

   o  Please beware of implementation issues caused by Section 3.1.

   o  Here's how you include references [I-D.ribose-cfrg-sm4],
      [RFC7253], [RNP].
