                     Simple Registration Reporting
           draft-yee-regext-simple-registration-reporting-01

Abstract

   Domain name registries and registrars report to each other by sharing
   bulk information through files.  This document creates two IANA
   registries to create a standard reporting mechanism between domain
   name registries and registrars.  The first IANA registry lists
   standard data elements and their syntax for inclusion in the files.
   The second IANA registry lists standard reports based on the standard
   data elements.  Each report is a file formatted as a CSV file.  The
   advantage of this reporting mechanism is that reports, each file, can
   be imported by recipients without any prior knowledge of their
   contents, although reporting is enhanced with a minimum of knowledge
   about the files.  The mechanism for the transmission and reception of
   the files is a matter of local policy.

1.  Introduction

   Currently, domain name registry operators (the producer) create and
   set their own domain name registration reports for use by their
   registrars (the consumer).  Among the distinctions that vary by
   producers is the syntax of the data provided, e.g., date formats, and
   the format of the collection of the data provided, e.g., the report
   may be a CSV file that tends to allow for straightforward importation
   or a PDF file that can be problematic to import.  In addition,
   although there are a number of best practice reports that have
   evolved, these are not currently documented as such, which results in
   a fair amount of customization on the part of the consumers to import
   data.

   This document standardizes the name and syntax of the data elements
   to be used across all existing domain name registration reports and
   creates an IANA registry of them to facilitate their evolution,
   including adding additional data elements as needed.  In addition, a
   known set of existing standard reports using the aforementioned data
   elements is specified in another IANA registry to facilitate the
   evolution of the reports and adding additional report definitions as
   needed.

   Each report definition MUST use the data elements defined here,
   including all future reports.  Future reports and future data

   elements may be specified in their own individual documents, updating
   the IANA registries as needed.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Data Element Specification

   Data elements are grouped into categories for convenience.  There is
   no other significance to the groupings.

   Each data element conceptually represents the column heading in a
   printed report.  It is a single unit of information that can be
   passed from the producer to the consumer.  The primary purposes of
   the IANA registry of data elements are to ensure that each data
   element is assigned a unique name and that the syntax of each data
   element is specified.

   The name of the data element MUST be unique and this characteristic
   MUST be enforced by registry.  The name is used in the report
   definition (in the next section) to alert the consumer as to what to
   expect in the file and how to import the data element.

   The field names MUST NOT contain any whitespace and MAY use US-ASCII
   underscores (_) as a separator.

   The US-ASCII comma (,) and backslash (\) are special and MUST NOT
   appear in any field name or data element value.  In order to include
   either character it must be quoted as follows.

   *  COMMA - to insert a comma precede it with a backslash thus (\,).

   *  BACKSLASH - to insert a backslash precede it with a backslash thus
      (\\).

   The syntax of the data element MAY be whatever is appropriate for the
   information to be passed.  In most cases it will be imported from
   other standard specifications where the data element is already
   defined for use in other protocols.  In all cases the syntax
   restriction mentioned above MUST be respected.

   The subsections below comprise an initial list of known data elements
   commonly being used between producers and consumers as of the date of
   publication of this document.  The title of the subsection is the
   field name for the data element.

3.  Report Definition Specification

   Each report specification conceptually represents a file of comma
   separated values (commonly called a CSV file) where the values are
   selected from the data elements specified above.  The first row of
   the file is a comma separated list of field names as specified in the
   data element registry.  The remaining rows of the file are the
   unordered sets of data elements, one set per row, where each row is
   one transaction in the report.

   Each data element conceptually represents the column heading in a
   printed report.  The first row represents the column headings and
   each succeeding row represents a transaction of the report.

   A consumer MUST be able to receive data elements that are not
   recognized and MAY skip them accordingly, both in the header row and
   in the transaction rows.

   A report is specified in the report registry with two pieces of
   information.  First is the name of the report.  This can be whatever
   is appropriate as defined by the producer of the report.  The name of
   the report MUST be unique and this characteristic MUST be enforced by
   registry.

   Second is the ordered list of field names of what is included in the
   report.  The field names MUST be listed in the data element registry
   specified above.  The field names and the data MUST appear in the
   report in the order listed in the report registry.

   The subsections below comprise an initial list of standard reports
   commonly being used between producers and consumers as of the data of
   publication of this document.  The title of the subsection is the
   report name.
