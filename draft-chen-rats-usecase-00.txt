1.  Introduction

   At present, it is necessary to complete the authentication before
   accessing the operator's network to obtain the service.  RATS aimed
   at the solutions to provide interoperable way for domain-specific
   attestation mechanisms, within RATS relying party may not to maintain
   the authentication background, as an ISP what may be involved at the
   level of access authentication is preshared secret keys based
   authentication, the authentication based on PSK(Preshared secret
   keys) is different from identity-based authentication, such as
   IBC(Identity-Based Cryptograph).

   After access to the network, operators can also provide application
   layer authentication services for a variety of applications.  At
   present, there are many application layer authentication methods, it
   can be divided into certificate-based and non-certificate-based
   certification systems, so there are the following situations.  One
   application authenticated by certificate-based PKI system may request
   resource access to a server or service, but the server or service's
   authentication function is based on identity which is belong to non-
   certificate-based certification systems.  These are all possible
   future demand scenarios, also in the context of the RATS.  Due to
   limitation of resource, many companies are unable to operate their
   own certification and willing to rely on the result from operator to
   reduce their cost, and operator can provide authentication services.
   Multiple certification centers would be made due to different kinds
   of request from service and perspective of deployment, before
   obtaining a certification center's service, certification center need
   proof for identification, including software and hardware health
   information.  These certification centers are based on regions then
   there have manage barriers, how can clients from a certification
   center asstest themselves' identities to another certification
   center.  Especially now there are more virtual resources, cloud
   resources, one need to prove whether it has access to the resources
   and can protect the data.  From an internal business perspective, how

   to integrate resources, achieve cross-domain trust and break down
   management barriers in order to streamline and improve flexibility
   will also be something rats[I-D.ietf-rats-architecture] can do.

2.  Terminology

   The readers should be familiar with the terms defined in.

   In addition, this document makes use of the following terms:

   PSK:  Preshared secret keys means keys are shared in advance between
      the authentication parties.

   IBC:  Identity-Based Cryptograph, it is an asymmetric public key
      cryptosystem.

   PKI:  Public Key Infrastructure, an infrastructure built with a
      public-key mechanism.

3.  Use Cases

   This section describes use cases which happens inside an ISP.

3.1.  Access authentication based on different method

   This section considers the level of access authentication.  For
   operators, the access of users is usually based on preshared secret
   keys, preset with symmetric secret keys before the release.  The
   first access only needs to be activated, and subsequent
   authentication uses PSK to complete data protection which is based on
   Symmetric secret key system.  In addition, there are other identity-
   based authentication methods, the access authentication based on
   identity is asymmetric and the identity is the public key, this
   approach makes it easier for the peer to obtain the public key of the
   other peer.

   In short, these are two different authentication methods.  When a
   psk-based authentication device needs to request an identity-based
   service, it needs to prove its' trustworthiness to the other party
   and the whole process need to ensure the confidentiality of evidences
   and attestation results.

3.2.  Application authentication based on different system

   At the application level, due to limitation of resource, many
   applications need operators to provide business authentication
   services.  At present, there are two business authentication methods:
   one is certification-based PKI system authentication, because the
   management of certificates is always a very big problem, so the other
   is non-certificated, such as identity-based authentication whose
   identity is readable.

   When cross-business authentication is required, how to prove one's
   identity to the other will be a common problem.
