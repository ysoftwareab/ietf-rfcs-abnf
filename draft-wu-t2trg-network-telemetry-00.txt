1.  Introduction

   Today, billions of devices can connect to the internet and VPN and
   establish a good ecosystem of connectivity.  Our daily life also has
   been greatly changed with a large number of IoT applications and
   mobile application being built on top of it (e.g., smart tags on many
   daily life objects, wearable health monitoring sensors, smartphones,
   intelligent cars, and smart home appliances).  However, the increased
   amount of connection of devices and the proliferation of web and
   multimedia services also imposes a great impact on the network.
   Examples include:

   o  The massive scale and highly dynamic nature of the IoT
      applications and mobile applications (e.g., interaction with other
      thing at anytime and in any location)

Internet-Draft       Network Telemetry and Big Data           March 2016


   o  The increasingly vast amounts of data gathered from the network
      enviroment at varying speeds, with different amounts of accuracy,
      and the new communication patterns created

   o  The disparate types of pre- and post-processing necessary to
      understand the meaning and context (e.g., semantics) of measured
      data

   Therefore the network may be subject to increased network incidents
   and unregulated network changes, without better network visibility or
   a good view of the available network resources and network topology,
   it is not easy to

   o  schedule network resource to adapt to near real-time service
      demands

   o  measure the network performance and assess network quality as a
      whole

   o  provide quick network diagnosis, prove network innocence when the
      application quality get worse or identify what parts of the
      network can cause problems if a network glitch or service
      interruption happens.

   In this document, we first define network telemetry in the context of
   network environment, followed by an exemplary architecture for
   collecting and processing telemetry data.  We then explore the
   characteristics of network telemetry data, and end with describing a
   set of issues with retrieving and processing network telemetry data.

2.  The definition of Network Telemetry

   Network Telemetry describes how information from various data sources
   can be collected using a set of automated communication processes and
   transmitted to one or more receiving equipment for analysis tasks.
   Analysis tasks may include event correlation, anomaly detection,
   performance monitoring, metric calculation, trend analysis, and other
   related processes.

3.  Network Telemetry architecture

   A Network Telemetry architecture describes how different types of
   Network Telemetry data are transmitted from different network sources
   and received by different collection entities.  In an ideal network
   telemetry architecture, the ability to collect data should be
   independent of any specific application and vendor limitations.  This
   means that protocol and data format translation are required, so that

Internet-Draft       Network Telemetry and Big Data           March 2016


   a normalized form of data can be used to simplify the various
   analysis and processing tasks required.

   The Network Telemetry architecture is made up of the following three
   key functional components:

   o  Data Source: The Data Source can be any type of network device
      that generates data.  Examples include the management system that
      accesses IGP/BGP routing information, network inventory, topology,
      and resource data, as well as other types of information that
      provides data to be measured and/or contextual information to
      better understand the network telemetry data.

   o  Data Collector: The Data Collector may be a part of a control and/
      or management system (e.g., NMS/OSS, SDN Controller, or OAM
      system) and/or a dedicated set of entities.  It gathers data from
      various Data Sources, and performs processing tasks to feed raw
      and/or processed data to the Data Analyzer.

   o  Data Analyzer: The Data Analyzer processes data from various data
      collectors to provide actionable insight.  This ranges from
      generating simple statistical metrics to inferring problems to
      recommending solutions to said problems.

   Figure 1 shows an exemplary architecture for network telemetry and
   analysis.

   o  Data Abstraction and Modeling Software.  This component uses an
      overarching information model to define relevant terms, objects,
      and values that all components in the Network Telemetry
      Architecture can use.

   o  Edge Software refers to performing compute, storage, and/or
      networking functions on nodes at the edges of a network.  This
      enables processing of data to occur at or near the source of the
      data.  Figure 4 shows that some information from some Data Sources
      may be sent directly to Data Collectors, while other data may be
      sent first to Edge Software for further processing before it is
      consumed by Data Collectors.

   o  Policy-based Manager.  This component is responsible for managing
      different aspects of the Network Telemetry Architecture in a
      distributed and extensible manner through the use of a set of
      policies that govern the behavior of the system.  Examples include
      defining rules that determine what data to collect when, where,
      and how, as well as defining rules that, given a specific context,
      determine how to process collected data.

   This reference architecture assumes that Data Collectors can choose
   different measurement data formats to gather measurement data, and
   different protocols to transmit said data; the Data Abstraction and
   Modeling Software normalizes collected data into a common form.  Both
   the Data Collector and the Data Analyzer may support data filtering,
   correlation, and other types of data processing mechanisms.  In the
   above architecture, bi-directional communication is shown for
   generality.  This may be implemented a number of different ways, such
   as using a request-response mechanism, a publish-subscribe mechanism,
   or even as a set of uni-directional (e.g., push and pull) requests.

4.  Measurement data Characteristics

   Measurement data is generated from different data sources, and has
   varying characteristics, including (but not limited to):

   o  Measurement data can be any of network performance data, network
      logging data, network warning and defects data, network statistics
      and state data, and network resource operation data (e.g.,
      operations on RIBs and FIBs[RFC4984]).

   o  Most measurement data are monitor state data rather than
      configuration data.  However, on occasion, network configuration
      data may also be included (e.g., to establish context for the
      measurement data).

Internet-Draft       Network Telemetry and Big Data           March 2016


   o  In many cases, telemetry data requires real time delivery with
      high throughput, multi-channel data collection mechanisms.

   o  In most cases, the required frequency of access to monitoring
      state data is extremely high.

5.  Issues

5.1.  Data Fetching Efficiency

   Today, the existing data feching methods (See appendix B) prove
   insufficiency due to the following factors:

   o  The existing Network management protocol is not dedicated and also
      not sufficient for data collection.

      *  E.g.,NETCONF more focus onnetwork configuration, only retrieve
         operational data

   o  SNMP relies on Periodic fetching.  Periodic fetching of data is
      not an adequate solution for many types of applications

      *  E.g., Applications that require frequent update to the stored
         data

      In addition, it adds significant load on participating networks,
      devices, and applications

   o  We increasingly rely on RPC-style interactions [RFC5531] to fetch
      data on demand by application.  However most of applications are
      interested in update of the data or change to the data.

   o  When data fetching protocol is selected, human readable format
      such as XML, JSON to encode structured data enable us to parse
      without knowing schema, however it lacks efficiency on the wire.

5.2.  Existing Network Level Metrics Inefficiency issue

   Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) assessment
   [RFC7266] of multimedia services has been well studied in ITU-T SG
   12.  Media quality is commonly expressed in terms of MoS (Mean
   Opinion Score) [RFC3611][G107].  MoS is typically rated on a scale
   from 1 to 5, in which 5 represents excellent and 1 represents
   unacceptable.  When multimedia application quality becomes bad,it is
   hard to know whether this is network problem or application specific
   problem(e.;g.,Codec type, Coding bit rate, packetization scheme, loss
   recovery technique,the interaction between transport problems and
   application-layer protocols ).  To make sure this is not network



Wu, et al.             Expires September 10, 2016               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft       Network Telemetry and Big Data           March 2016


   problem or know how serious network events or network interrruption
   is, network health index or network key performance Index(KPI) or key
   quality index(KQI) becomes important.

   However, QoS/QoE assessment of network service that is dependent on
   or not dependent on the underlying network technology (e.g., MPLS,
   IP) is not well studied or defined in any body or organization.  The
   QoS/QoE of generic network services requires a set of appropriate
   network performance, reliability, or other metric definitions.  This
   may take the form of key quality and or performance indicators,
   ranging from high-level metrics (e.g., dropped calls) to low-level
   metrics (e.g., packet loss, delay, and jitter).  IP service
   performance parameters are defined in ITU-T Y.1540 [Y1540]; however,
   these existing network performance metrics are proving insufficient
   due to several factors:

   o  These transport-specific metrics are defined for specific
      technologies.  For example, network performance parameters in
      Y.1540 are only designed for IP networks, and do not apply to
      connection- oriented networks, such as an MPLS-TP network.

   o  Not all the metrics are end-to-end performance metrics at the
      network level.  For example, the TE performance metrice defined in
      ISIS-TE [RFC5305] is only defined for per link usage.

   o  These transport specific metrics are all single objective metrics;
      there are no transport specific metrics defined as multi-objective
      metrics.  For example, IP transfer Delay (IPTD) is a single-
      objective metric and cannot be used to measure similar and
      important performance behaviors such as IP packet Delay
      Variation[Y1541]).

   o  Different services have different performance requirements.  It is
      hard to measure network QoS to satisfy all possible services using
      a single metric.

   o  Transport-specific metrics are not applied to the whole network,
      but to a specific flow passing through the network corresponding
      to matched QoS classes.

   o  If there are multiple paths from source to destination in the IP
      network, then transport-specific metrics change with the path
      selected and it may be also hard to know which path the packet
      will traverse.

Internet-Draft       Network Telemetry and Big Data           March 2016


5.3.  Measurement data format consistency issue

   The data format is typically vendor- and device-specific.  This also
   means that different commands, having different syntax and semantics
   characteristics that use different protocols, may have to be issued
   to retrieve the same type of data from different devices.

   The Data Analyzer may need to ingest data in a specific format that
   is not supported by the Data Collectors that service it.  For
   example, the ALTO data format used between a data source and a Data
   Collector generates an abstracted network topology and provides it to
   network-aware applications (i.e., a Data Analyzer) over a web service
   based API [I-D.wu-alto-te-metrics].  In this case, prefix data in the
   network topology information need to be generated into ALTO Network
   Maps, TE (topology) data needs to be generated into ALTO Cost Maps.
   To provide better data format mapping, ALTO Network Map and Cost MAP
   need to be modeled in the same way as prefix data and TE data in the
   network topology information.  However, these data use different data
   formats, and do not have a common model structure to represent them
   in a consistent way.

   This is why the architecture shown in Figure 1 has a "Data
   Abstraction and Modeling Software" component.  This component
   normalizes all data received into a common format for analysis and
   processing by the Data Analyzer.  If this component is not present,
   then the Data Analyzer would have to deal with m vendor devices X n
   versions of software for each device at a minimum.  Furthermore,
   different protocols have different capabilities, and may or may not
   be able to transmit and receive different types of data.  The Data
   Abstraction and Modeling Software component can provide information
   that defines the structure of data that should be received; this can
   be useful for checking for incomplete collection data as well as
   missing collection data.

5.4.  Data Correlation issue

   To provide consistent configuration, reporting and representation for
   OAM information, the LIME YANG model [I-D.draft-ietf-lime-yang-oam-
   model-01] is proposed to correlate defects, faults, and network
   failures between the different layers and irregardless of network
   technologies.  This helps improve efficiency of fault detection and
   localization, and provide better OAM visibility.

   Today we see large amounts of data collected from different data
   sources.  These data can be network log data, network event data,
   network performance data, network fault data, network statistics
   state, network operation state.  However, these data can only be
   meaningful if they are correlated in time and space.  In particular,



Wu, et al.             Expires September 10, 2016               [Page 9]

Internet-Draft       Network Telemetry and Big Data           March 2016


   useful trend analysis and anomaly detection depend on proper
   correlation of the data collected from the different Data Sources.
   In addition, Correlate different type data from different Data
   Sources with time or space can provide better network visibility.
   But such correlations is still an challenging issue.

5.5.  Data Synchronization Issues

   When retrieving data from Data Sources or Data Collectors,
   synchronization the same type of data between data source and data
   collector or between data collector and data analyzer is a
   complicated thing.

   o  Arrange src and dst synchronized, especially when multiple source
      feed one data collector, or multiple data collector feed one data
      analyzer

   o  Aggregate data from different data source and synchronize the data
      to the data analyzer is also not easy task.

   The reference architecture of Figure 1 defines a "Policy-based
   Manager" to manage the set of data that are collected how, when,
   where, and by which devices.  This component provides mechanisms that
   help ensure that needed information is collected by the appropriate
   components of the Network Telemetry Architecture.  It also
   facilitates the synchronization of different components that make up
   the Network Telemetry Architecture, since these are likely
   distributed throughout one or more networks.

   It also provides a mechanism for the Data Analyzer, or other
   applications (e.g., the "Data Fusion, Analytics, and other Apps", as
   well as the "Decision Logic and Apps" components in Figure 1) to
   provide information to the Policy-based Manager in the form of
   feedback (e.g., see [I-D.draft-strassner-anima-control-loops-01]).

Appendix B.  Existing Network Data Collection Methods

B.1.  Network Log Collection

   There are three typical Log data Collection methods:

   o  Text based Collection

Internet-Draft       Network Telemetry and Big Data           March 2016


   o  SNMP Trap

   o  Syslog based Collection

B.1.1.  Text based data collection

   Text base Log data is designed for low speed network.  The amount of
   IoT data can not be too large.  It only can be parsed by the network
   personnel with experience to define such kind of Log. The log data
   can be transferred either by Email or via FTP.  The difference
   between using Email and using FTP are:

   o  The volume of data transferred by FTP can be much larger than via
      Email.

   o  FTP based collection is active data collection while Email based
      collection is passive data collection

B.1.2.  SNMP Trap

   SNMP Trap is a notification mechanism which enables an agent to
   notify the management system of significant events by way of an
   unsolicited SNMP message.  In case there are large number of devices
   and each device has large number of objects, SNMP Trap is more
   efficient to get the data than polling information from every object
   on every device.

B.1.3.  Syslog based Collection

   Syslog protocol is used to convey event notification messages and
   allows the use of any number of transport protocols for transmission
   of syslog messages.  It is widely used in the network device((e.g.,
   switch, router) .

B.2.  Network Traffic Collection

   Network Traffic Collection is a process of exporting network traffic
   flow information from routers, probes and other devices.  It doesn't
   care operation state on the network device but traffic flow
   characteristic on the links between any two adjacent network device.
   Take IPFIX as an example, it is widely adopted in the router and
   switch to get IP traffic flow information for the network management
   system.

B.3.  Network Performance Collection

   Network performance collection is a process of exporting network
   performance information from routers, probers and other devices.  The
   network peformance information can be applied to the quality,
   performance, and reliability of data delivery services and
   applications running over network.  It is also applied to traffic
   contract argreed by the user and the network service provider.
   Measurement mechanism defined in IPPM WG and OAM technology and OAM
   tools can be used to perform performance measurement.

B.4.  Network Faults Collection

   Network fault collection is a process of exporting network fault,
   failure, warning, defects from router, probers and other devices.  It
   usually adopts OAM technology,OAM tools, OAM model(e.g., SNMP MIB or
   NETCONF YANG model) to localize fault and pinpoint fault location.
   However OAM YANG model is mainly focused on configure OAM
   functionality on the network element, how to use OAM YANG model to
   collect more data, e.g., warning, failure, defects and how to use
   these data needs to be further standardized.

B.5.  Network Topology data Collection

   For network topology data collection, routing protocols are important
   collection method, since every router need to propagate its
   information throughout the whole network.  In addition, we can use
   NMS/OSS to get network topology data if they have access to network
   topology database or routing protocols.

   Network Topology data comprise node information and link information.
   It can be collected in two typical ways, if the network topology data
   is within one IGP area or one AS, we can use ISIS protocol or OSPF to
   gather them and write into RIB or topology datasore, and then we can
   use I2RS protocol to read these network topology data; if the network
   topology data is beyond one IGP area and span across several domains,
   we can use BGP-LS [I-D.ietf-idr-ls-distribution][I-D.ietf-idr-te-pm-
   bgp] to collect network topology data in different domain and
   aggregated them in the central network topology database.

B.6.  Other Data Collection

   To collect and process large volume of data in real time or in near
   real time to detect subtle event and aid failure diagnosis, we can
   choose some other data fetching efficient tools, e.g., Facebook's
   Scribe, Chukwa built on top of Hadoop File subsystem to parse out
   structured data from some of the logs and load them into a datastore.
