Abstract

   In some environments, a relay agent resides in a network element
   which also has access to one or more VPNs.  If one DHCP server wishes
   to offer service to DHCP clients on those different VPNs the DHCP
   server needs to know the VPN on which each client resides.  The vpn-
   id sub-option of the relay-agent-information option is used by the
   relay agent to tell the DHCP server the VPN for every DHCP request it
   passes on to the DHCP server, and is also used to properly forward

Internet Draft             VPN-ID sub-option                   July 2001


   any DHCP reply that the DHCP server sends back to the relay agent.


1.  Introduction

   There exist situations where there are multiple VPNs serviced by one
   or more network elements which also contain relay agents.   These
   VPNs contain DHCP clients, and there is a desire to allow one DHCP
   server to supply the full range of DHCP services to these DHCP
   clients.

   The network element which contains the relay agent typically is also
   the network element which knows about the VPN association of the DHCP
   client and could include this information in the relay-agent-
   information option in the client's DHCP requests.  This document
   defines a sub-option for the relay-agent-information option which
   contains the vpn-id, and which allows the relay agent to communicate
   the VPN association to the DHCP server.

   When the DHCP server sends its response to the relay agent for for-
   warding back to the DHCP client, the relay agent will also need to
   use the vpn-id sub-option to determine to which VPN to send the DHCP
   response.

   This sub-option can also be used by the DHCP server to inform a relay
   agent that a particular DHCP client is associated with a particular
   VPN by sending the vpn-id sub-option to the relay agent in the
   relay-agent-information option back to the relay agent.


   Consider the following architecture:


          +--------+         +---------------+
          |  DHCP  |     IP x|  Relay Agent  | IP z
          | Server |-.......-|     and       +---+-------+-------+
          +--------+         |  VPN manager  |   |       |       |
                             +---+-----------+   |       |       |
                                 |IP y        +-----+ +--+--+ +--+--+
                               +-+-----+      |Host1| |Host2| |Host3|
                               |       |      +-----+ +-----+ +-----+
                               |       |
                            +-----+ +--+--+         VPN 2
                            |Host1| |Host2|
                            +-----+ +-----+

Internet Draft             VPN-ID sub-option                   July 2001


   In this architecture, the relay agent knows the VPN for each of the
   DHCP clients, and inserts that information in the vpn-id sub-option
   in every DHCP request it forwards onto the DHCP server.

   When the DHCP server copies over the relay-agent-information option
   from the request to the reply packet, it will copy over the vpn-id
   sub-option as well.

   When the relay agent receives a DHCP reply packet from the server
   with a vpn-id sub-option, it will forward the packet onto the proper
   VPN based on the value of the vpn-id sub-option.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC 2119].

   This document uses the following terms:

      o "DHCP client"

        A DHCP client is an Internet host using DHCP to obtain confi-
        guration parameters such as a network address.

      o "DHCP relay agent"

        A DHCP relay agent is a third-party agent that transfers BOOTP
        and DHCP messages between clients and servers residing on dif-
        ferent subnets, per [RFC 951] and [RFC 1542].

      o "DHCP server"

        A DHCP server is an Internet host that returns configuration
        parameters to DHCP clients.

      o "downstream"

        Downstream is the direction from the access concentrator towards
        the subscriber.

      o "upstream"

        Upstream is the direction from the subscriber towards the access
        concentrator.

      o "VPN"

Internet Draft             VPN-ID sub-option                   July 2001


        Virtual private network.  A network which appears to the client
        to be a private network.

      o "VPN Identifier"

        The VPN-ID is defined by [RFC2685] to be a sequence of 14 hex
        digits.


3.  VPN identifier sub-option definition

   The vpn-id sub-option MAY be used by any DHCP relay agent which
   desires to specify the VPN from which a DHCP client request was sent.

   The vpn-id sub-option contains a generalized VPN identifier.

   The format of the option is:



           SubOpt   Len   Type    VPN identifier
          +------+------+------+------+------+------+---
          | TBD  |   n  |  t   |  id1 |  id2 |  id3 | ...
          +------+------+------+------+------+------+---

          Type:    0      NVT ASCII VPN identifier
                   1      RFC2685 VPN-ID
                   2-255  Not Allowed



   There are two types of identifiers which can be placed in the vpn-id
   sub-option.  The first type of identifier which can be placed in the
   vpn-id sub-option is an NVT ASCII string.  It MUST NOT be terminated
   with a zero byte.

   The second type of identifier which can be placed in the vpn-id sub-
   option is an RFC2685 VPN-ID [RFC 2685], which is typically 14 hex
   digits in length (though it can be any length as far as the vpn-id
   sub-option is concerned).

   A relay agent which recieves a DHCP request from a DHCP client on a
   VPN SHOULD include a vpn-id sub-option in the relay-agent-information
   option that it inserts in the DHCP packet prior to forwarding it on
   to the DHCP server.

   The value placed in the vpn-id sub-option SHOULD be sufficient for
   the relay agent to properly route any DHCP reply packet returned from

Internet Draft             VPN-ID sub-option                   July 2001


   the DHCP server to the DHCP client for which it is destined.  Servers
   supporting this sub-option MUST return an identical copy of the sub-
   option in the relay-agent-info option to any relay-agent that sends
   it.

   In the event that a vpn-id option and a vpn-id sub-option are both
   received in a particular DHCP client packet, the information from the
   vpn-id sub-option MUST be used in preference to the information in
   the vpn-id option.

   Relay agents which include this sub-option when forwarding DHCP
   client requests MUST discard DHCPOFFER or DHCPACK packets that do not
   contain this sub-option in their associated relay-agent-info options.

   In some cases, a DHCP server may use the vpn-id sub-option to inform
   a relay agent that a particular DHCP client is associated with a par-
   ticular VPN.  It does this by sending the vpn-id sub-option with the
   appropriate information to the relay agent in the relay-agent-
   information option.  If the relay agent is unable to honor the DHCP
   server's requirement to place the DHCP client into that VPN it MUST
   drop the packet and not send it back to the DHCP client.

4.  Security

   DHCP currently provides no authentication or security mechanisms.
   Potential exposures to attack are discussed is section 7 of the pro-
   tocol specification [RFC2131].  The vpn-id sub-option could allow a
   program masquerading as a relay agent to obtain addresses on other
   VPNs than the one on which it resides, possibly aiding in an
   address-pool exhaustion attack on that VPN.

   This attack can be partially prevented by the relay agent not for-
   warding any DHCP packet which already contains a relay-agent-
   information option.  Any program which unicasts a DHCP packet to the
   DHCP server with a relay-agent-information option in it with a vpn-id
   for a different VPN would cause the DHCP server to allocate an
   address from that different VPN, but since the DHCP server cannot (in
   general) communicate directly back to the program that sent in the
   malicious DHCP packet, the entire cycle of creating a lease will not
   be completed.  Certainly many leases could be offered, which would
   result in a form of address-pool exhaustion.

   Under the current DHCP security model there are no methods available
   to completely circumvent this type of attack.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a number space for the type byte of the vpn-id

   sub-option.  Certain allowable values for this byte are defined in
   this specification.  New values may only be defined by IETF Con-
   sensus, as described in [RFC 2434].  Basically, this means that they
   are defined by RFCs approved by the IESG.

   Moreover, any changes or additions to the type byte codes MUST be
   made concurrently in the type byte codes of the vpn-id option.  The
   type bytes and data formats of the vpn-id option and vpn-id sub-
   option MUST always be identical.
