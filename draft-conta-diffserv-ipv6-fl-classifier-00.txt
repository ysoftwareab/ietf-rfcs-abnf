Abstract

   This memo specifies an IPv6 Flow Label classifier for Differentiated
   Services.


1. Introduction


   This document specifies an IPv6 flow label classifier for
   Differentiated Services [Diffserv]. It is supposed to provide the
   IPv6 addition to the current Differentiated Services specifications
   that define classifiers [Diffserv-model].

   The IPv6 flow label is supposed to be used to achieve a more
   efficient processing of packets in quality of service engines in IPv6

2. IPv6 Flow Label classifier

   The IPv6 flow label Differentiated Services classifier is a multi-
   field (MF) classifier [Diffserv], [Diffserv-model]. It classifies
   packets based on three or four fields in the packet header (the
   latter including the DSCP). The three field IPv6 flow label
   classifier is using the following fields from the IPv6 header: the
   destination address, the source address, and the flow label. The four
   field IPv6 flow label classifier is adding the DSCP field from the
   IPv6 header to the classification fields.

   The following is an example of  a possible MF filter:

         Flow-label-classifier:
         Type:              IPv6-3-tuple
         IPv6DestAddrValue
         IPv6DestAddrMask:
         IPv6SrcAddrValue:
         IPv6SrcAddrMask:
         IPv6Flowlabel:


         Flow-label-classifier:
         Type:              IPv6-4-tuple
         IPv6DestAddrValue
         IPv6DestAddrMask:
         IPv6SrcAddrValue:
         IPv6SrcAddrMask:
         IPv6FlowLabel:
         IPv6DSCP:
