Abstract

   This document describes a URN (Uniform Resource Name) namespace that
   is engineered by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) for naming
   persistent resources published by the OGC.  The formal 
   Namespace  identifier (NID) is "ogc".

1. Introduction

   The OGC is a voluntary consensus standards organization. The OGC was
   Founded in 1994. The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) produces 
   many kinds of technical documents, including: standards, working 
   drafts, technical reports, discussion papers, and XML schemas. 
   The OGC wishes to provide persistent, location-independent 
   Identifiers for these resources. Further, a number of OGC standards
   and application schemas of OGC standards are now used and/or
   references by standards specifications from other standards 
   organizations, including OASIS, the IETF, IEEE, ISO, and OMA.

Internet-Draft        A URN namespace for the OGC            August 2007

   
   The core mission of the OGC is to develop spatial interface and encoding
   specifications that are openly available and royalty free. Products 
   and services that conform to OGC interface specifications enable users
   to freely exchange and process spatial information across networks,
   computing platforms, and products.  Interoperability in such an
   environment is facilitated by the use of a system of persistent
   identifiers that are global in scope. The OGC is the only standards
   organization whose mission is specifically focused in interfaces
   and encodings for geospatial content and services.

   Motivated by these concerns, the OGC would like to assign formal 
   URNs to published resources in order to provide persistent, 
   location-independent identifiers for them. The process for 
   registering a namespace identifier is documented in RFC 3406 [2].

   The official IANA registry of URN namespaces is available online:
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/urn-namespaces>.

2. URN Specification for "ogc" NID

   Namespace ID:

      The NID "ogc" is requested.

   Registration Information:

      Registration Version Number: 1
      Registration Date: 2007-08-16

   Declared registrant of the namespace:

      Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. (Headquarters)
      35 Main Street, Suite 5
      Wayland, MA 01778-5037, USA
      c/o Carl Reed (creed@opengeospatial.org)

   Declaration of syntactic structure:

      The Namespace Specific String (NSS) of all URNs that use the "ogc"
      NID will have the following structure:

         urn:ogc:{OGCresource}:{ResourceSpecificString}

      where the "OGCresource" is a US-ASCII string that conforms to the
      URN syntax requirements [RFC2141] and defines a specific class of
      resource type.  Each resource type has a specific labeling scheme
      that is covered by "ResourceSpecificString", which also conforms
      to the naming requirements of [RFC2141].

      The OGC maintains a naming authority, the OGC Naming Authority
      (ONA), that will manage the assignment of  "OGCresources" and the
      specific registration values assigned for each resource class.

Internet-Draft         A URN namespace for the OGC              August 2007



   Relevant ancillary documentation:

      The OGC Naming Authority (ONA) provides information on the
      registered resources and the registrations for each. More information 
      about ONA and the registration activities and procedures to be 
      followed are available at:

      https://portal.opengeospatial.org/wiki/twiki/bin/view/Member/OGCUrnIntro

      A beta version of the OGC URN resolver has been developed and is
      available at http://urn.opengis.net/. The resolver provides a 
      registry of many of the currently member approved OGC URN's used in
      currently approved and implemented OGC standards. 

      There are a number of OGC Best Practice and Standards documents
      that define member agreements on OGCresource and 
      ResourceSpecificString 

   Identifier uniqueness considerations:

      The ONA manages resources using the "ogc" NID and will be the
      authority for managing the resources and subsequent strings
      associated.  In the associated procedures, ONA will ensure the
      uniqueness of the strings themselves or shall permit secondary
      responsibility for management of well-defined sub-trees.

      OGC may permit use of experimental type values that will not be
      registered.  As a consequence, multiple users may end up using the
      same value for separate uses.  As experimental usage is only
      intended for testing purposes, this should not be a real issue.


   Identifier persistence considerations:


      ONA will provide clear documentation of the registered uses of
      the "ogc" NID.  This will be structured such that each OGCresource
      will have a separate description and registration table.

      The registration tables and information will be published and
      maintained by ONA on the OGC web site.
   
   Process of identifier assignment:

      ONA uses the approved OGC standards policies and procedures for
      discussion, approval and registration of each type of resource 
      maintained (https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=12586)
      Each such resource may have three types of registration activities:

         1) Registered values associated with OGC specs or services
         2) Registration of values or sub-trees to other entities
         3) Name models for use in experimental purposes

Internet-Draft         A URN namespace for the OGC           August 2007        

   Process for identifier resolution:

      The namespace is not listed with an RDS; this is not relevant.

   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:

      No special considerations; the rules for lexical equivalence of
      [RFC2141] apply.

   Conformance with URN Syntax:

      No special considerations.

   Validation mechanism:

      None specified.  URN assignment will be handled by procedures
      implemented in support of ONA activities.

   Scope:

      Global

3. Examples

      The following examples are representative urns that have been 
      assigned by ONA.
         
          urn:ogc:specification:gml:doc-is(02-023r4):3.0.0 

      Defines the urn to be used to identify version 3.0.0 of an OGC
      specification document for the Geography Markup Language in the OGC
      document archives.
         
         urn:ogc:serviceType:CatalogueService:2.0.2:HTTP 
         
      Defines the urn to be used for an application to specify the 
      specific service type for an OGC Catalogue service.

         urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:6.3:26986

      Is the URN defined to reference the definition of the Coordinate
      Reference System (CRS) with code 26986 that is specified in
      version 6.3 of the EPSG database.

    4.0 Namespace Considerations:

      There is currently no available namespace that will allow the OGC
      to uniquely specify and access resources, such as schemas and
      registries, that are required by organizations implementing OGC
      standards. There is also a need for other standards organizations,
      such as OASIS and the IETF to be able to access OGC specific
      resources.

Reed                   draft-creed-ogc-urn-02.txt               [Page 4]
Internet-Draft         A URN namespace for the OGC         August   2007
    
      The OGC members considered use of other existing NIDs, such as
      those for OASIS and OMA. However, the semantics for geospatial
      content and services have a number of unique characteristics,
      such as the expression of coordinate reference systems. The URN
      syntax used by OASIS and OMA do not support the necessary 
      elements to express the full semantics used in the geospatial
      community.

   5.0 Community Considerations
      Many of the current OGC standards require access to resources,
      such as schemas, registries, catalogues, OGC documents, and OGC 
      enabled services. In order for the larger IT community to be
      able to effectively implement applications that access OGC 
      resources, a unique namespace is required. We desire these
      resources to be freely and openly available as a set of
      community resources.

      As background, since 2003, the OGC membership has considered
      and developing expertise in using the OGC URN. The knowledge
      and experience gained through implementation experiments and 
      a variety of operational testbeds contributed to the current OGC
      URN specification. The knowledge has been documented in a variety
      of OGC documents (mentioned above) as well as an operational
      OGC URN resolver. Work is also underway on a publicly accessible
      OGC URN registry. These resources are necessary for a number of
      reasons, including the fact that numerous agencies and 
      organization, such as NATO and NGA, have mandated procurement
      policy that requires use of specific OGC standards and their 
      related OGC URNs.

6. Security Considerations

     There are no additional security considerations other than those
     normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general.
