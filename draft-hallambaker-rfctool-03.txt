                      draft-hallambaker-rfctool-03

Abstract

   This memo presents a technique for using as subset HTML as a source 
   format for documents in the Internet-Drafts (I-Ds) and Request for 
   Comments (RFC) series. The HTML subset provides equivalent 
   functionality to the traditional XML2RFC tool but is designed for 
   ease of use with readily available editing tools.

   Extensions to the HTML markup allow the use of external bibliography 
   files to manage citations and references in the manner of BibTeX. 
   Planned extensions include building concordances of defined terms and
   normative language.

Internet-Draft          Writing I-Ds using HTML             October 2014

1. Why a New Format is Needed.

   One of the more difficult aspects of working in the IETF is producing
   Internet Drafts that comply with the IETF formating criteria 
   originally developed in the age of valve tube machines.

   HTML2RFC is a HTML microformat for Internet Drafts (and RFCs). 
   Documents written in the HTML2RFC microformat may be converted to a 
   variety of target formats that currently include Internet Draft 
   Plaintext [RFC2223], XML2RFC [RFC2629] and HTML in the IETF 
   presentation stylesheet.

   While existing tools enable the generation of documents in Internet 
   Draft format, none provide the features necessary to allow the 
   document editor to focus on the task of editing text rather than 
   dealling with the distraction of producing text in the obligated 
   format.

   One area in which all recent document formats fall short is in the 
   management of references in citations. While the online citation 
   libraries introduced in XML2RFC are exceptionally useful, accessing 
   them though XML entities or cut-and-paste of the citation sources is 
   tedious and error prone. Patashnik and Lamport demonstrated a much 
   superior system in 1985 in BibTeX.[BibTeX].

1.1. Why Existing Tools Fail

   [RFC2629] which describes the XML2RFC tool was published in 1999, a 
   time when XML was the document format of the future. Although 
   advanced XML editing tools were expensive with poor usuability, this 
   deficiency was expected to be resolved in the very near future. 
   [RFC2629] did not make editing Internet Drafts easy but it was better
   than the available alternatives and made it possible to produce 
   documents in both the plaintext format required for Internet Draft 
   subissions and readable formats such as HTML.

   Almost fifteen years later, XML document authoring tools are still 
   expensive and none of the many tools the author has tried offers more
   than a modest improvement over editing XML source by hand. The tools 
   merely make it a little easier to enter XML tags. The author is still
   required to remember the many idiosyncracies of the XML2RFC DTD which
   uses a mixture of case conventions (hangText vs texttable) and oddly 
   chosen tag and attribute names. The only consistency in the design of
   the DTD is that it follows none of the conventions established in 
   HTML. Even the paragraph tag is inexplicably labelled <t>.

   Another area in which use of [RFC2629] is unsatisfactory is in the 
   handling of citatitions and references. While the online library of 
   references is certainly very useful, making use of it in a document 
   is fiddly and time consuming. Citations must be managed in three 
   separate parts of the document. Entity declarations linking to the 



Hallam-Baker                 April 30, 2015                     [Page 3]

Internet-Draft          Writing I-Ds using HTML             October 2014

   external reference declarations are inserted at the top of the file 
   while the citation is added to the end of the file. To create a 
   reference to the citation in the body of the text we must create a 
   crosslink to the anchor defined inside the external reference which 
   may or may not be the same as the entity name defining the reference.

   The method of handling references makes it difficult to prepare 
   documents in offline environments (e.g. a plane) and can cause 
   editing tools that attempt DTD validation to behave slowly or 
   unpredictably as attempts are made to retrieve the external content 
   while the file is being edited.

1.2. Why HTML is Better

   One of the principal reasons that HTML has become the most widely 
   used document markup format is that the basic structure markup is 
   very simple and can be learned in a few minutes. Virtually every 
   modern text editor offers at least the ability to generate HTML as an
   output markup. A wide range of HTML editing tools is available for 
   every modern computing platform. Many of the best tools are free.

   While entering HTML tags is easy, editing or reviewing text that is 
   cluttered with markup tags is unnecessarily tedious and error prone. 
   Editing a document describing a XML protocol in raw XML source form 
   is particularly error prone as every occurrence of an XML markup 
   character must be escaped, often rendering the text almost 
   unreadable. Many HTML editors allow the editor to view source and 
   formatted views of their document side by side or quickly switch from
   one to the other. This is much more efficient than trying to edit XML
   that is converted into readable text by a stylesheet.

   The original HTML 2.0 markup described in [RFC1866] was intended to 
   provide a means of describing the document structure. The most recent
   edition, HTML 5 [W3C.CR-html5-20121217] is considerably more 
   complicated, offering a melange of structure, format, style and 
   scripting features. Fortunately almost all the requirements of 
   HTML2RFC are met by features of the original HTML 2.0 markup that 
   have not been updated or obsoleted since.

1.3. Markdown Format Should be considered

   Although HTML is widely supported by WYSIWYG editors, many authors 
   favor an even simpler format. RFCs largely consist of text, section 
   headings and bulleted lists, the popular markdown format is thus 
   capable of meeting 90% of formatiing needs. 

   The traditional 'plaintext' RFC format, while excrable as a 
   presentation format is servicable as an input format. If the markdown
   format was choosen carfully, it might accept traditional RFCs as 
   input. [?Appendix] provides a trial sketch of such a scheme.

1.4. The Need to Combine XML2RFC and BibTeX Reference Management

   One of the key innovations introduced in [BibTeX] was the ability to 
   separate the tasks of document editing and bibliography management. 
   Once compiled, a bibliography could be shared between multiple 
   documents or even multiple users. It is not uncommon for a good 
   bibliography file to be shared by whole university departments.

   The reference management feature of xml2rfc also provides 
   considerable advantages over previous approaches. The online library 
   of reference descriptions is maintained by automatic tools 
   eliminating the need to enter most entries manually. While the 
   xml.resoure.org repository hardly exhaustive it is rare that an 
   Internet Draft contains more than one or two citations that are 
   outside its scope.

   The major drawback to the xml2rfc approach is that the online tool 
   fails completely when editing documents in offline mode. Authors can 
   maintain a local cache of references they use in their own documents 
   but they must develop the necessary tools to do so themselves.

   HTML2RFC combines the advantages of the BibTeX and xml2rfc 
   approaches. The string [!RFC1149] within the text declares a 
   normative reference to RFC1149 while [~RFC1149] declares an 
   informative reference. The HTML2RFC tool attempts to resolve 
   references by consulting a local bibliography file. Unresolved 
   references are then resolved through a set of (extensible) rules and 
   (optionally) appended to one or more of the user's personal 
   bibliography files. For example, citation labels that begin with the 
   prefix 'RFC' may be resolved by a HTTP query to the xml.resource.org 
   repository.

2. Document Markup

   * Basics - elements are defined by tags, 

   * Elements may have attributes but these are used sparingly. In 
   particular HTML markup conventions require that text which is 
   normally displayed to the user be entered as element content rather 
   than as attributes.

   * character entities are used to escape the markup characters

   * Except in the <pre> element, multiple spaces are collapsed to 
   single spaces. To prevent whitespace folding, use the &nbsp; tag.









Hallam-Baker                 April 30, 2015                     [Page 5]

Internet-Draft          Writing I-Ds using HTML             October 2014

   * Every HTML document must contain the following elements:

   <?xml ?>
   <html>
     <head>
       <title>The document title (displayed in the window frame)</title>
     <body>
   
       <!-- Document text goes inside here -->
   
     </body>
   </html>

   Although the HTML markup requires that a <title> element be present, 
   the term title is understood to be text to be shown in 'title bar' of
   the window frame in which the document is displayed. HTML2RFC uses 
   the first <h1> tag in the document to display the title instead as 
   this is guaranteed to be displayed prominently in a HTML text editor 
   while many do not bother to show the <title> element contents at all.

   Following the convention established by xml2rfc, HTML2RFC divides the
   RFC content into front, middle and back sections. These are delimited
   by <h1> heading elements as follows:

      Front
         The front matter begins with the first <h1> element and ends at
         the second <h1> element.

      Middle
         The middle matter begins with the second <h1> element and ends 
         at the first <h1> element with a heading that begins with the 
         string 'Appendix:'.

      Back
         The back matter begins with he first <h1> element with a 
         heading that begins with the string 'Appendix:' and runs to the
         end of the document.

   It is not necessary to create sectionsfor References or Authors' 
   Addresses, these will be included and given appropriate titles as 
   necessary. The outline of an HTML2RFC document is therefore:

Internet-Draft          Writing I-Ds using HTML             October 2014

   <?xml ?>
   <html>
     <head>
       <title>The document title (displayed in the window frame)</title>
     <body>
       <h1>Document Title</h1>            <!-- Start of Front Matter -->
         <!- Document abstract, metadata and author details go here -->
         <p>First paragraph of document abstract</p>
         <p>Second paragraph of document abstract</p>
       <h1>First section</h1>            <!-- Start of Middle Matter -->
         <p>First paragraph</p>
       <h1>First section</h1>
       <h1>Second section</h1>
       <h1>Appendix:First appendix</h1>
       <h1>Second appendix</h1>
     </body>
   </html>

   Document structure in HTML is infered from the placement of heading 
   elements. This approach is considerably easier to manage and less 
   error prone than the xml2rfc approach which requires the author to 
   correctly mark the beginning and the end of each section.

3. Document Text

   HTML2RFC uses only the core HTML markup designed for declaring 
   document structure: <h1> ... <h6>, <p>, <pre>, <ul>, <ol>, <dl>, 
   <li>, <dt>, <dd>, <table>, <th>, <tr>, <th>, <td>.

   Only the id attribute is currently recognized, all other attributes 
   are discarded or overwritten.

Internet-Draft          Writing I-Ds using HTML             October 2014

   +-------------------+--------+-------------------+------------------+
   | Markup            | Status | Attributes        | Description      |
   +-------------------+--------+-------------------+------------------+

   +-------------------+--------+-------------------+------------------+

   Although HTML provides most of the prinitives required to markup an 
   RFC, it does not provide the necessary tags to markup the text that 
   appears at the front of an Internet Draft, the author names, document
   type and other information that is presented in the masthead and 
   opening section. This information is declared in HTML2RFC using a 
   'microformat' a stylized method of using HTML tags. 

   This section describes the use of standard HTML markup tags to define
   the document structure. The microformat is described in [?Section] 
   following. The use of the id attribute to create references to 
   document sections is described in [?Section]

3.1. Headings

   The <h1>, <h2, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6> elements specify section 
   headings. The element content is the heading text. Document section 
   and appendix numbers are added automatically.

   The first and second <h1> element in the document are special. The 
   first <h1> element specifies the title of the document and begins the
   document properties microformat section described below. The second 
   <h1> element marks the end of the document properties microformat and
   the beginning of the document proper.

   A <h1> element with heading text that begins with the string 
   'Appendix:' is an appendix heading. Once one appendix heading is 
   encountered in a document, all the following <h1> elements are 
   interpreted as appendix headings whether they begin with the string 
   'Appendix:' or not.

3.2. Paragraphs

   The <p> and <pre> elements specify paragraphs. <p> elements specify 
   ordinary paragraphs that will be formatted by the processing tool 
   while the <pre> element is used for preformatted text such as code 
   examples where spaces must be preserved.

3.3. Lists

   The <ul> element specifies an unordered list (aka bullet point). Each
   list item is specified by a list item <li> element:






Hallam-Baker                 April 30, 2015                     [Page 9]

Internet-Draft          Writing I-Ds using HTML             October 2014

   <ul>
     <li>A list item</li>
     <li>Another list item</li>
     <li>Yet another list item</li>
   </ul>

   To create an ordered list (aka numbered), the <ol> element is used 
   instead:

   <ol>
     <li>This list item will be number 1</li>
     <li>This list item will be number 2</li>
     <li>This list item will be number 3</li>
   </ol>

   Definition list <dl> elements contain lists of defined term <dt> and 
   defined data <dd> tags. Although the formatting of <dt> and <dd> 
   elements strongly sugests that they are pairs, HTML permits them to 
   appear in any order.

   <dl>
     <dt>Defined Term #1</dt>
     <dd>Definition of term #1</dd>
     <dt>Defined Term #2</dt>
     <dd>Definition of term #2</dd> 
   </dl>

   Lists may be nested in lists to create a hierachy. The inner list 
   type may be the same as the type of the enclosing list or a different
   type.

3.4. Tables

   Due to the need to support conversion to IETF Plaintext and xml2rfc 
   formats, the html2rfc table model is considerably simpler than the 
   html model. The colspan and rowspan attributes are ignored and the 
   width attribute is currently unimplemented.

   The <table> element specifies a table. A table element may contain 
   only <tr> and <caption> elements. Each <tr> element specfies a row of
   the table. The optional <caption> element specifies a title for the 
   table. The <caption> element is only permitted as the first and/or 
   last element in the list:











Hallam-Baker                 April 30, 2015                    [Page 10]

Internet-Draft          Writing I-Ds using HTML             October 2014

   <table>
     <caption>Table title</caption>
     <tr> .. .. .. </tr>
     <tr> .. .. .. </tr>
     <tr> .. .. .. </tr>
     <tr> .. .. .. </tr>
     <caption>Table title</caption>
   </table>

   Table cells are specified using the <th> or <td> elements. <th> 
   elements specify heading cells, <td> elements specify cells in the 
   body of the table. If the first row of a table contains at least one 
   <th> cell, the header will be repeated at the head of each page if 
   the table is split across pages. Note that while the formatting tool 
   may split a table so that different rows are presented on different 
   pages, a page boundary will not be placed in the middle of a row 
   unless the cell is too long to present any other way.

4. Document Properties Microformat.

   The document properties are specified in the front matter which 
   begins with the first <h1> heading and ends with the second <h1> 
   heading. 

   The only HTML elements permitted within the front matter are <p>, 
   <dl>, <dt> and <dd>. All other tags are ignored but may raise 
   warnings.

4.1. Abstract

   The document abstract is specified using <p> elements. <p> elements 
   that are empty or only contain whitespace are ignored. All other <p> 
   elements specify a paragraph of the abstract. Since Internet Drafts 
   are required to provide an abstract, at least one <p> element that 
   contains text is required.

4.2. Document Properties

   Document properties are tag value pairs specified using a definition 
   list <dl> element. Each <dt> element specifies a tag and each <dd> 
   element a value. Some document properties permit a list of values to 
   be specified. A document can only have one file name but it can have 
   multiple keywords. When there are multiple values for the same 
   property, it is only necessary to specify the tag once as successive 
   <dd> elements specify values for the tag specified in the last <dt> 
   element encountered.








Hallam-Baker                 April 30, 2015                    [Page 11]

Internet-Draft          Writing I-Ds using HTML             October 2014

   The document properties for this document are specified as follows:

   <dl>
     <dt>Abrrev</dt>     <dd>Writing I-Ds using HTML</dd> 
     <dt>Docname</dt>    <dd>draft-hallambaker-html2rfc</dd> 
     <dt>Version</dt>    <dd>00</dd> 
     <dt>Area</dt>       <dd>General</dd> 
     <dt>Keyword</dt>    <dd>RFC</dd> 
                         <dd>Request For Comments</dd> 
     <dt>IPR</dt>        <dd>trust200902</dd> 
     <dt>Category</dt>   <dd>std</dd>
   </dl>

   The document properties have been formatted in tabular form to help 
   comprehension but this is not necessary.

   Each document property is specified by means of a case insensitive 
   tag. In most cases the document property tag is the same as the 
   corresponding xml2rfc element or attribute. Although most authors are
   likely to need to consult the documentation when specifying document 
   properties, this is considered to be acceptable as the need to add 
   properties to an existing document is relatively infrequent.

4.2.1. IPR Values

   The IPR property specifies a label which will eventually identify a 
   set of boilerplate text that can be imported from an external file. 
   This will avoid the need for users to update their document authoring
   tools in response to changes in IETF policy.

4.2.2. Category

   [TBS]

4.3. Authors

   Authors are specified in the same way as the document properties. The
   author properties are specified as follows:

   +--------------+----------------------------------------------------+
   | Tag          | Description                                        |

   In practice the Author, surname, initials, organization and email are
   usually sufficient. 

5. Advanced Markup.

   In addition to making existing document editing tasks easier, 
   HTML2RFC adds several new features to make maintaining a standards 
   document easier:

      *  Documents may be split into multiple files facilitating use of 
         automatically generated content.

      *  Citations specified in the body of the text are detected 
         automatically and resolved to generate the necessary 
         references.

      *  Concodances of defined terms and normative text may be 
         generated.

5.1. Including Text From External Sources.

5.1.1. <?Include?> Processing Directive

   The <?include?> Processing directive is used to include text from an 
   external source. The directive takes two attributes:

      file
         The file name

      format
         The file format, xml or txt

   The text from the included document is inserted at the current 
   position in the file

   In the following example, the text for Sections four and five are 
   inserted from an external file.

   <h1>Section Three</h1>
   <?include file="generated.xml" format="xml"?>
   <h1>Section Six</h1>

   The include file processing directive is useful for combining 
   sections of text that are either generated or verified by automatic 
   tools.

   The format parameter is intended to allow the processing tool to 
   perform appropriate format conversion as the text is included. At 
   present only XML fragments are supported.

   Since the semantics of the processing directive are only understood 
   by the document processing tools and are disregarded by text editors,
   a HTML2RFC document that includes <?include?> processing directives 
   MUST be a well formed HTML document both before and after the 
   external document is inserted.

   One of the main advantages of moving from the XML2RFC model of 
   specifying sections as nested XML elements to the HTML model of 
   infering section boundaries from headings is that it makes the use of
   text from included files considerably more flexible.

   The following format types are reserved for future use:

5.1.2. <?stylesheet?> Processing Directive

   The <?stylesheet?> processing directive takes the same file= 
   attribute as the <?include?> directive except that the directive is 
   only processed when generating HTML output in which case the included
   file MUST contain a CSS stylesheet and the text is copied to the 
   output file directly to a <style> element in the HTML <head> element.

5.2. References and Citations.

5.2.1. Citations

   Citations in the body of the text are specified by means of a 
   citation marker. The citation marker tells the document processor

      *  That a citation label is about to follow

      *  That the citation is normative or informative

      *  The label to be used to retrieve the corresponding reference 
         from the bibliographic sources

      *  (optional) The preferred citation tag to use in the final text

   Each reference is identified by means of a text label. For 
   convenience the documents commonly referenced in IETF specifications 
   have compact predfined labels. For example, [RFC0822] has the label 
   RFC0822.

   Citation markers have the following forms:

      [.!label]
         Normative reference to the reference 'label' to be presented as
         [label] in the final text.

      [.!label/tag]
         Normative reference to the reference 'label' to be presented as
         [tag] in the final text.

      [.~label]
         Informative reference to the reference 'label' to be presented 
         as [label] in the final text.

      [.~label/tag]
         Informative reference to the reference 'label' to be presented 
         as [tag] in the final text.

   The document processing tool automatically resolves the citation 
   labels to references and presents them as lists of normative and 
   informative references.

Internet-Draft          Writing I-Ds using HTML             October 2014

   If a document contains a normative and an informative reference to 
   the same document, the reference is listed in the normative 
   references section.

5.2.2. Resolving Citation Labels

   Citation labels are resolved by consulting a bibliography file or 
   bibliographic source. HTML2RFC documents may declare bibliography 
   files and bibliographic sources by means of processing instructions. 
   Document processing tools May consult additional built in 
   bibliographic sources. The order of precedence for resolving 
   bibliographic sources is:

      0) Bibliography files in the order they are declared in the source
         document

      0) Bibliographic sources in the order they are declared in the 
         source document

      0) Bibliographic sources built in to the processing tool

   Bibliography files are XML fragments that contain a list of xml2rfc 
   <reference> elements, each of which defines a single reference. The 
   <?bibliography?> processing instruction declares a bibliography file 
   to be searched to resolve references. 

      file
         The filename of the bibliography to be searched

      format
         The format of the bibliography to be searched 

      cached
         If present, the document processor will append any references 
         returned from one of the bibliographic sources to the end of 
         the file at the end of document processing.

   Use of the cached attribute allows references fetched from 
   bibliographic souces to be saved for future use. 

   Rather than risk inserting new references into the middle of a file, 
   the tool appends new reference entries to the end. Since the XML 
   specification requires that an XML document only have one toplevel 
   document, this means that the bibliography files are actually XML 
   fragments rather than XML documents and some XML editing tools may 
   present the user with tedious and unnecessary warnings.

   One of the main objectives in designing a tool that can be used to 
   produce documents for multiple standards development organizations is
   to encourage other organizations to maintain bibliographic source 
   servers providing access to authoritative versions of the documents.

5.2.3. <?bibsource?> Processing Directive

   The <?bibsource?> processing directive allows additional 
   bibliographic sources to be defined. A bibliographic source is simply
   a Web server that responds to a GET request to fetch the content 
   corresponding to a URI formed from the citation label by performing a
   set of predefined processing rules.

   Users are not expected to need to use the <?bibsource?> processing 
   directive as the html2rfc tool contains built in rules to access all 
   the known bibliographic sources the tool is currently capable of 
   reading.

      prefix
         Specifies the labels that may be resolved through this source. 
         The source will be used to resolve unresolved labels that start
         with the specified prefix.

      uri
         A URI pattern to be expanded to form the URI to be used to 
         attempt resolution of the reference.

   A bibliographic source is only queried if the citation label matches 
   the prefis specified. For example, a bibliographic source with the 
   prefix 'RFC' will be queried to attempt resolution of the citation 
   label RFC822 but not the label draft-hallambaker-html2rfc.

   The uri attribute actually specifies a URI matching pattern. The URI 
   matching pattern may contain one or two hash '#' characters.

   If one hash character is specified, it is replaced by the portion of 
   the citation label that follows the prefix. If the citation label is 
   RFC822 and the prefix is 'RFC', a single hash character will be 
   replaced by the string '822'.

   Several of the bibliographic sources at xml.resource.org have 
   filenames in which the document number of numbered documents are 
   padded with preceeding zeros. While this maintains the correct 
   collation order for directory listings and the like, the simple 
   character susbstitution mechanism would break unless we remembered to
   use RFC0822 as the citation label.

   More complicated substitution capabilities may be attempted by 
   specifying a C# string formatting directive in between two hash 
   marks. For example the matching specifier #d4# tells the processor to
   convert the portion of citation label following the prefix to an 
   integer and then format the integer with preceeding zeros so that it 
   is at least 4 characters in length.

5.2.4. References to other document sections.

   Cross references to other parts of a document are specified using the
   HTML id attribute and anchor <a> element.

   The id attribute declares an anchor label within the current 
   document. Anchor labels MUST NOT be declared more than once.

   The processing tool automatically creates anchor labels for section 
   headings that do not have an id attribute specified as follows:

   +------------------------+----------------------------+
   | id                     | Use                        |
   +------------------------+----------------------------+
   | Section_<n>            | Section heading            |
   |                        |                            |
   | Section_<n>_<n>        | Subsection  heading (etc.) |

   |                        |                            |
   | Appendix_<a>_<d> ...   | Appendix subheading (etc.) |

   |                        |                            |
   | References_Informative |                            |
   |                        |                            |
   | Abstract               |                            |

   | Title                  |                            |
   |                        |                            |
   | Author_<n>             | Author #n                  |
   +------------------------+----------------------------+

   The anchor element <a> creates a cross reference to the section 
   identified by an anchor. The href attribute specifies the link 
   target, in this case a URI document fragment identifier which is 
   denoted by a hash character '#' followed by the anchor label. 

   If the content of the anchor element begins with the prefix [?, the 
   entire contents of the anchor element will be replaced by a suitable 
   cross reference text. If the content of the anchor element does not 
   begin [?, it will not be replaced.

   For example the following internal cross reference would be rendered 
   as (see [?Section 4]) in either the HTML or Plaintext output modes.

   (see <a href="#Section_4">[?Section]</a>

   RFCs normally use references rather than hypertext links in the 
   running text, this allows a reader to see which external sources are 
   referenced by looking at just the referenced. But use of hypertext 
   links is occasionally desirable. To do this we simply insert a 
   hypertext link as usual but specify a full URL rather than merely a 
   fragment.

   For example, to create an external reference to the IETF Web Site 
   ([?IETF Web]) we write:

   The IETF Web site is <a href="http://www.ietf.org/">[?IETF Web]</a>

5.3. Concordance of Normative Language

   Tracking the use of normative language inside the text can take 
   considerable effort in the later stages of standards development. The
   keywords MUST, SHOULD and MAY defined in [RFC2119] require particular
   actions to be taken when determining if a specification is ready to 
   progress from RECOMMENDED to STANDARD status.

   HTML2RFC processing tools can easily identify the occurrence of 
   normative keywords but merely counting the number of MUST keywords 
   and the pages on which they occur adds little value since the context
   of the requirement is lost. Heuristic approaches such as extracting 
   the sentence in which the normative language occurs offers only a 
   modest improvement in clarity.

   The HTML <span> element MAY be used to specify the portion of text in
   which the normative language is used that is sufficient to identify 
   the term in a concordance. If the <span> element specifies an id 
   attribute, it specifies the label to be used to identify the 
   normative requirement in the concordance.

   For example, the normative language in the preceeding paragraph is 
   marked as follows:

   <p><span id="MAY-SPAN">The HTML &lt;span&gt; element MAY be used to 
   specify the portion of text in which the normative language is used 
   that is sufficient to identify the term in a concordance.</span> 
   If the &lt;span&gt; element specifies an id attribute, it specifies 
   the label to be used to identify the normative requirement in 
   the concordance.</p>

   The concordance of normative language would contain the following 
   entry as a result:

Internet-Draft          Writing I-Ds using HTML             October 2014

      [MAY-SPAN]
         The HTML <span> element MAY be used to specify the portion of 
         text in which the normative language is used that is sufficient
         to identify the term in a concordance.

5.4. Concordance of Defined Terms.

   The concordance of defined terms is generated in the same manner as 
   the concordance of normative language except that the html <dfn> tag 
   is used to specify the definition in the text. If the <dfn> tag is 
   embedded in a <span> element, the <dfn> element is the defined term 
   and and <span> element marks the definition.  If the <dfn> tag is 
   embedded in a <dt> element, the definition is taken from the 
   following <dd> element.

5.5. Index Elements

   Index elements are declared using the following syntax:

      [*Term]
         Add 'Term' to the index.

      [*Term/Sub]
         Add 'Sub' to the Index as a sub entry under 'Term'

Appendix A: rfctool Command Line Tool

   rfctool is a command line tool that converts from the HTML2RFC subset
   of HTML to other document formats. At the time of writing these are:

      html
         HTML output formatted using a stylesheet that produces an IETF 
         style masthead.

      txt
         IETF Plaintext format at 58 lines per page and 72 characters 
         per line and a formfeed between lines.

      xml
         [~RFC2629] format to allow HTML2RFC documents to be shared with
         other authors.

   The following commands are supported:

      /about
         Describe the rfctool tool

      [/html] <input> [/html <htmlout>] [/xml <xmlout>] [/txt <txtout>] 
         [/lazy]
         Read the file <input> as HTML2RFC source and produce the 
         specified output format(s).

      /merge <input> <output> [/lazy]
         Read the file <input>, perform processing of embedded 
         <?include?> processing directives and write the result to the 
         file <output>.

   The default command is /html.

   The /lazy option tells the tool to only process the input file if 
   either the inpout file or the tool itself is newer than all the 
   specified outputs. This option allows html2rfc to be used in build 
   scripts without requiring unnecessary actions.

   The /html command accepts the following options but these are not 
   currently implemented:

      /bib
         Specify a bibliography file to be included





Hallam-Baker                 April 30, 2015                    [Page 23]

Internet-Draft          Writing I-Ds using HTML             October 2014

      /style
         Specify a file to be incorporated into the HTML output as a 
         stylesheet

      /w3c
         Generate HTML output compliant with W3C formatting rules

      /boilerplate
         Extract boilerplate text definitions from the specified file

   The tool requires that the input file be strictly compliant with XML 
   requirements but does not perform schema validation and simply 
   ignores markup that it does not understand. The document outputs are 
   (or should be) fully compliant with the HTML and/or XML2RFC DTDs.

Appendix B:  Markdown Syntax

   Use of Markdown syntax was suggested as an alternative to HTML. The 
   following markdown syntax would permit existing RFCs to be read as 
   input source, simplifying (but not automating) the process of 
   updating existing RFCs. It is assumed that any such tool would strip 
   out header and footer information automatically, eliminating the need
   to distingush these from running text.

Appendix C: Features Not Implemented from XML2RFC

   The following xml2rfc features are not yet implemented due to lack of
   time:

      *  Table column widths. 

      *  Centered and right formatted table columns.

      *  Citation of external URL resources

      *  Error handling does not identify source line where problem 
         occurred.

      *  Headers and footers in HTML output

      *  Use of <caption> tag to generate captions for tables.

   The following features are described in this document but not 
   implemented due to lack of time

      *  Ability to create lists of normative language sorted into MUST 
         / SHOULD / RECOMMENDED / MAY

      *  Ability to specify definitions and defined terms and raise 
         errors when defined terms have no definition

      *  Ability to import code files and automatically translate into 
         examples / schemas / etc.

      *  Ability to read back generated HTML (round trip)

      *  Write out the list of errors into the HTML output as XML 
         comments.

Internet-Draft          Writing I-Ds using HTML             October 2014

      *  Add anchors into HTML output to show page transitions.

      *  Lists of tables, figures

      *  Citation references in the XML2RFC input

   The following xml2rfc features are not implemented on account of 
   diminishing returns:

      *  Ability to specify symbols other than * in lists 

      *  Use of letters rather than numbers in lists 

      *  Use of complicated formatting in lists. 

      *  Index entries are not supported due to a lack of a suitable 
         HTML element to use for markup

   The following features are intentionally omitted:

      *  Ability to chose whether to generate a ToC, depth etc. Every 
         document needs a ToC.

      *  Generating output in PDF: Use a tool like wkhtmltopdf instead.

   The following are really just bugs:

      *  The tool does not support P tags nested inside LI, DT or DD 
         elements as separate paragraph markers

      *  No handling of <BR> tag

      *  The HTML output uses CDATA sections rather than converting 
         control characters to entities

      *  The HTML output does not use a stylesheet yet

      *  When resolving external referencess, these are only added to 
         the cache and will only be read on the next run of the tool
