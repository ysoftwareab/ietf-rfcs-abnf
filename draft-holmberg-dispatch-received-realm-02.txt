         Via header field parameter to indicate received realm
             draft-holmberg-dispatch-received-realm-02.txt

Abstract

   This specification defines a new Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
   Via header field parameter, "received-realm", which allows a SIP
   entity acting as an entry point to a transit network to indicate from
   which adjacent upstream network a SIP request is received, using a
   network realm value associated with the adjacent network.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  General

   When SIP sessions are established between networks belonging to
   different operators, or between interconnected networks belonging to
   the same operator (or enterprise), the SIP requests might traverse
   transit network.

   Such transit networks might provide different kind of services.  In
   order to do that, a transit network often needs to know to which

   operator (or enterprise) the adjacent upstream network, from which
   the SIP session initiation request is received, belongs.

   This specification defines a new Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
   Via header field parameter, "received-realm", which allows a SIP
   entity acting as an entry point to a transit network to indicate from
   which adjacent upstream network a SIP request is received, using a
   network realm value associated with the adjacent network.

   NOTE: As the adjacent network can be an enterprise network, an Inter
   Operator Identifier (IOI) cannot be used to identity the network, as
   IOIs are not defined for enterprise networks.

   The following sections describe use-case where the information is
   needed.

1.2.  Use-Case: Transit Network Application Services

   The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) TS 23.228 specifies how
   an IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) network can be used to provide
   transit functionality.  An operator can use its IMS network to
   provide transit functionality e.g. to non-IMS customers, to
   enterprise networks, and to other network operators.

   The transit network operator can provide application services to the
   networks for which it is providing transit functionality.  Transit
   application services are typically not provided per user basis, as
   the transit network does not have access to the user profiles of the
   networks for which the application services are provided.  Instead,
   the application services are provided per served network.

   When a SIP entity that provides application services (e.g. an
   Application Server) within a transit network receives a SIP request,
   in order to apply the correct services it needs to know the adjacent
   upstream network from which the SIP request is received.

1.3.  Use-Case: Transit Network Routing

   A transit network operator normally interconnects to many diferent
   operators, including other transit network operators, and provides
   transit routing of SIP requests received from one operator network
   towards the destination.  The destination can be within an operator
   network to which the transit network operator has a direct
   interconnect, or within an operator network that only can be reached
   via one or more interconnected transit operators.

   For each customer, i.e. interconnected network operator for which,
   the transit network operator routes SIP requests towards the

Internet-Draft               received realm                     May 2016


   requested destination a set of transit routing polices are defined.
   These policies are used to determine how a SIP request shall be
   routed towards the requested destination to meet the agreement the
   transit network operator has with its customer.

   When a SIP entity that performs the transit routing functionality
   receives a SIP request, in order to apply the correct set of transit
   routing policies, it needs to know from which of its customers, i.e.
   adjacent upstream network, the SIP request is received.

2.  Applicability

   The mechanism defined in this specification MUST only be used by SIP
   entities that are able to verify from which adjacent upstream network
   a SIP request is received.

   The mechanism for verifying from which adjacent upstream network a
   SIP request is received is outside the scope of this specification.

3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

4.  Definitions

   SIP entity: SIP User Agent (UA), or SIP proxy, as defined in RFC
   3261.

   Adjacent upstream SIP network: The adjacent SIP network in the
   direction from which a SIP request is received.

   Network entry point: A SIP entity on the border of network, which
   receives SIP requests from adjacent upstream networks.

   Inter Operator Identifier (IOI): A globally unique identifier to
   correlate billing information generated within the IP Multimedia
   Subsystem (IMS).

   JWT: JSON Web Token, as defined in RFC 7519.

5.1.  General

   The Via 'received-realm' header field parameter value is represented
   as a JSON Web Token (JTW) [RFC7519].  The JWT payload contains SIP
   header filed values, and the value representing the adjacent network.

   The procedures for encoding the JWT and calculating the signature are
   defined in [RFC7519].

5.2.  Header

   The following header parameters MUST be included in the JWT.

   o  The "typ" parameter MUST have a "JWT" value.

   o  The "alg" parameter MUST have the value of the algorithm used to
      calculate the JWT signature.

   NOTE: Operators need to agree on the set of supported algorithms for
   calculating the JWT signature.


   Example:

   {
           "typ":"JWT",
           "alg":"HS256"
   }


5.3.  Payload claims

   The follwoing payload claims MUST be included in the JWT.

   o  The "adjacent_network" claim has the value representing the
      adjacent network.

   o  The "sip_from_tag" claim has the value of the From 'tag' header
      field parameter of the SIP message.

   o  The "sip_date" claim has the value of the Date header field in the
      SIP message.

   o  The "sip_callid" claim has have value of the Call-ID header field
      in the SIP message.

   o  The "sip_cseq_num" claim has the numeric value of the CSeq header
      field in the SIP message.

Internet-Draft               received realm                     May 2016


   o  the "sip_via_branch" claim has value of the Via branch header
      field parameter of the Via header field, in the SIP message, to
      which the received-realm header parameter is attached.


   Example:

   {
           "adjacent_network":"operator_1.com",
           "sip_from_tag":"1928301774",
           "sip_date":"Fri, 20 May 2016 06:41:47 GMT",
           "sip_callid":"a84b4c76e66710@pc33.atlanta.com",
           "sip_cseq_num":"314159",
           "sip_via_branch":"z9hG4bK776asdhds"
   }


5.4.  Syntax

5.4.1.  General

   This section describes the syntax extensions to the ABNF syntax
   defined in [RFC3261], by defining a new Via header field parameter,
   "received-realm".  The ABNF defined in this specification is
   conformant to RFC 5234 [RFC5234].  "EQUAL", "LDQUOT", "RDQUOT" and
   "ALPHA" are defined in [RFC3261].  "DIGIT" is defined in [RFC5234].

5.4.2.  ABNF

         via-params     =/ received-realm
         received-realm = "received-realm" EQUAL jwt
         jtw            = LDQUOT header "." payload "." signature RDQUOT
         header         = *base64-char
         payload        = *base64-char
         signature      = *base64-char
         base64-char    = ALPHA / DIGIT / "/" / "+"

6.  User Agent and Proxy behavior

6.1.  General

   This section describes how a SIP entity, acting as an entry point to
   a network, uses the "received-realm" Via header field parameter.

Internet-Draft               received realm                     May 2016


6.2.  Behavior of a SIP entity acting as a network entry point

   When a SIP entity, acting as a network entry point, forwards a SIP
   request, or initiates a SIP request on its own (e.g. a PSTN gateway),
   the SIP entity adds a Via header field to the SIP request, according
   to the procedures in RFC 3261 [RFC3261].  In addition, if the SIP
   entity is able to assert the adjacent upstream network, and if the
   SIP entity is aware of a network realm value defined for that
   network, the SIP entity can add a "received-realm" Via header field
   parameter, conveying the network realm value, to the Via header field
   added to the SIP request.

   When the SIP entity adds a "received-realm" Via header field
   parameter to a SIP request, it MUST also calculate a Hash-based
   message authentication code (HMAC) [RFC2104] value from the parameter
   value, using a secret key which is shared between the SIP entity and
   any SIP entity which will use the parameter value.  The HMAC is then
   added to the parameter.

   When the receiver decodes the JWT, it MUST compare the JWT claims
   with the corresponding SIP header field information.  If there is a
   mismatch, the receiver MUST discard the received-realm header field
   parameter.

6.3.  Behavior of a SIP entity consuming the received-network value

   When a SIP entity receives a Via 'received-network' header field
   parameter, and intends to perform actions based on the header field
   parameter value, it MUST first check whether the values of the JWT
   claims representing SIP header field values match the associated SIP
   header field values within the SIP request.  If the values of the JWT
   claims representing SIP header field values do not match the values
   of the associated SIP header field values the SIP entity MUST discard
   the adjacent network information present in the JWT.  The SIP entity
   MAY take also take additional actions (e.g. rejecting the SIP
   request) based on local policy.

8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  'received-realm' Via header field parameter

   This specification defines a new Via header field parameter called
   received-realm in the "Header Field Parameters and Parameter Values"
   sub-registry as per the registry created by [RFC3968].  The syntax is
   defined in Section 5.4.  The required information is:

                                                  Predefined
   Header Field            Parameter Name         Values      Reference
   ----------------------  ---------------------  ----------  ---------
   Via                     received-realm         No          RFCXXXX


8.2.  JSON Web Token Claims Registration

   This specification defines new JSON Web Token claims in the "JSON Web
   Token Claims" sub-registry as per the registry created by [RFC7519].

   o  Claim Name: "adjacent_network"

   o  Claim Descritpoin: Adjacent network from where a SIP request is
      received

9.  Security Considerations

   As the received-realm Via header field parameter can be used to
   trigger applications, it is important to ensure that the parameter
   has not been added to the SIP message by an unauthorized SIP entity.

   The operator MUST change the key on a frequent basis.  The operator
   also needs to take great care in ensuring that the key used to
   calculate the JWT signature value is only known by the network entry
   point adding the received-realm Via header field parameter to a SIP
   message and the entities that use the parameter value.

Internet-Draft               received realm                     May 2016


   A SIP entity MUST NOT use the adjacent network information if the
   values of the JWT claims representing SIP header field values do not
   match the values of the associated SIP header field values.

   A SIP entity MUST use different key values for each parameter value
   that it recognizes and use to trigger actions.
