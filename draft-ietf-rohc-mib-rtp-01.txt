1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes a set of managed objects that allow
   monitoring of running instances of robust header compression.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        STD 16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC
        1215 [RFC1215].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described
        in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and

Internet-Draft                  ROHC MIB                      March 2002


        STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

    o   Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second version of
        the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards
        track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
        [RFC1901] and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version of the
        message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906
        [RFC1906], RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].

    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second set of
        protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in
        RFC 1905 [RFC1905].

    o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573
        [RFC2573] and the view-based access control mechanism described
        in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.


3.  Overview

   This section describes the basic model of RObust Header Compression
   (ROHC, [RFC3095]) used in developing the ROHC MIB module.

   ROHC presents a framework for IP header compression that allows
   flexible adjustment of compression efficiency versus robustness
   against channel errors depending on the underlying channel
   characteristics.

   ROHC introduces header compressors/decompressors at the end-points


Quittek, Hartenstein, Stiemerling                               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                  ROHC MIB                      March 2002


   (interfaces) of (wireless) channels on which ROHC header-compressed
   packets flow. ROHC exploits the temporal redundancy in successive
   packet headers of a packet flow by storing non-changing fields of the
   headers as well as reference values of predictably changing fields as
   context information. When the context information for a packet flow
   is also established at the decompressor, only delta-information and
   unpredictably changing header fields have to be sent over the
   channel. Since the context information will change over time, the
   decompressor's information on the context has to be kept 'in sync'.
   In order to update contexts at the decompressor, various header types
   can be used to efficiently transmit the information needed for the
   update.

   ROHC specifies three modes of operation: i) unidirectional mode where
   the decompressor does not give feedback to the compressor, ii)
   bidirectional reliable mode, and iii) bidirectional optimistic mode.
   The control mechanisms that determine what header types are allowed
   to be sent or to be decompressed are modeled as state machines.
   Detection of residual bit errors or damaged contexts at the
   decompressor as well as repair strategies are based on Cyclic
   Redundancy Checks (CRC) included in the compressed headers.

   This document specifies the ROHC MIB module in order to provide means
   for managing ROHC implementation via SNMP and within the IETF
   management framework. The objects defined support configuration
   management, fault management and performance monitoring.

   For configuration management implementation parameters (Section 6.3.
   of RFC 3095) and configuration parameters (including the ones
   specified in 5.1.1 of RFC 3095) can be verified by using the ROHC
   MIB.

   For fault management compressor/decompressor state and mode can be
   checked and the compressor context can be reinitialized.

   For performance management a set of statistics is provided including
   the number of flows that have used ROHC, the current and long term
   compression ratio, the number of reinitializations and the number of
   packets sent or received with different header types.


4.  Architectural Assumptions

   The MIB module defined below in Section 6 provides structured access
   to configuration data, state, performance data, and statistics of
   running instances of ROHC. When defining the MIB structure, some
   architectural assumptions had to be made. These assumptions cover
   basic architecture issues, such as entity relationships between
   compressors, channels, and IP network interfaces.



Quittek, Hartenstein, Stiemerling                               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                  ROHC MIB                      March 2002


   We are not sure that the list of architectural assumptions below is
   already complete. Possibly more assumptions are still hidden in the
   MIB module defintion and need to be identified. Furthermore, we are
   not sure that all of the listed assumptions are reasonable. We see
   the list as a starting point for a discussion on all assumptions.


4.1.  Concurrent Instances of ROHC

   At a network node serving as (de)compressor point serveral instances
   of ROHC implementations may run concurrently. These may all be
   instances of the same implementation, or they may be instances of
   different versions of the same implementation, or they may origin
   from different manufacturers.

   As an example take a ROHC implementation running completely on a
   network interface card. At a node equipped with several cards, each
   card runs its own independent instance. Typically all cards use the
   same ROHC implementation when the node is installed for the first
   time. But after some time some cards my be replaced or added without
   replacing or updating all installed cards. Then the newer card my run
   some recent versions of the ROHC implementations or even use other
   independent implementations.


4.2.  Single Instance per Interface

   No more than one instance of ROHC may act as (de)compression point
   for a specific (logical) IP interface.

   This assumption may be too restrictive. In general, systems can be
   built that violate this assumption. It needs to be discussed further,
   wether such systems are probable to be implemented or just irrelevant
   alternatives.


4.3.  Multiple Interfaces per Instance

   A single instance of ROHC may serve more than one IP interface. An
   example is a central implementation serving all interfaces of a
   network node.


4.4.  Channels may be Bi-directional

   Channels may carry data in both directions. This is typically not the
   case, but it does not require much additional effort to support bi-
   directional channels by the MIB structure, and we did not see any
   good reason to exclude future implementations on bi-directional
   channels. However, we still see this assumption as subject of further


Quittek, Hartenstein, Stiemerling                               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                  ROHC MIB                      March 2002


   discussions.


4.5.  Channel Used by Single Instance

   A channel is exclusively used by a single implementation of ROHC.


4.6.  Feedback Channel at Same Interface

   A feedback channel must be accessible at the same IP interface at
   which also the original channel is accessible.

   This is again a questionable assumption. One could think of using
   different logical interfaces for forward and backward channels. Input
   on how realistic such implementations are is very welcome.


5.  Structure of the MIB Module

   This section presents the structure of the MIB module. The objects
   are arranged into the following groups:

    o   instance group (rohcInstanceGroup)

    o   channel group (rohcChannelGroup)

    o   compressor group (rohcCompressorGroup)

    o   decompressor group (rohcDecompressorGroup)

    o   statistics group (rohcStatisticsGroup)


5.1.  The rohcInstanceGroup

   The rohcInstanceGroup consists of three tables, the
   rohcInstanceTable, the rohcIfTable, and the rohcHeaderTable.

   The rohcInstanceTable lists scalar properties of instances of ROHC
   implementations available at the managed node. The provided
   properties include vendor and version number of the implementation
   and technical properties, such as the provided clock resolution.

   The rohcIfTable contains one entry per IP interface at the managed
   node. It describes which (single) ROHC instance serves at which
   interface. Also it shows the status of the instance per interface.

   The rohcHeaderTable lists per ROHC instance all supported header
   types.

Internet-Draft                  ROHC MIB                      March 2002


5.2.  The rohcChannelGroup

   The rohcChannelGroup consists of two tables, the rohcChannelTable and
   the rohcProfileTable.

   The rohcChannelTable lists all channels per interface with their
   general properties described in Section 5.1.1. of RFC 3095.
   Furthermore, it includes counters for incoming and outgoing flows per
   channel, which used ROHC.

   The rohcProfileTable lists the set of profiles supported by the
   decompressor. The profiles are listed by their number as described in
   Section 5.1.2. of RFC 3095.

5.3.  The rohcCompressorGroup

   The rohcCompressorGroup consists of three tables, the
   rohcCompressorTable, the rohcPacketSizeTable, and the
   rohcPayloadSizeTable.

   The rohcCompressorTable lists and describes all compressor contexts
   per channel. The description includes context ID, state, mode, and
   profile of the compressor contex as well as the number of allowed
   packet sizes and the number of used packet sizes. A special object
   called rohcCompressorReinit allows the network manager to
   reinitialize the compressor context by setting the object.

   The rohcPacketSizeTable lists all allowed packet sizes per compressor
   context. Used packet sizes are marked. This table reflects the
   information contained in parameters PACKET_SIZES_ALLOWED and
   PACKET_SIZES_USED, as defined in RFC 3095, Section 6.3.1.

   The rohcPayloadSizeTable reflects the information contained in
   parameter PAYLOAD_SIZES, as defined in RFC 3095, Section 6.3.1.

5.4.  The rohcDecompressorGroup

   The rohcDecompressorGroup consists of a single table listing and
   describing all decompressor contexts. The description includes
   context ID, state, mode, and profile of the decompressor contex as
   well as the depth of reverse compression.

5.5.  The rohcStatisticsGroup

   The rohcStatisticsGroup consists of three tables, the
   rohcOutPacketCounterTable, the rohcInPacketCounterTable, and the
   rohcErrorTable. The first two tables contain counters per context and
   per header type for incoming and outgoing packets, repectively.  The
   rohcErrorTable contains counters for different error types.



Quittek, Hartenstein, Stiemerling                               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                  ROHC MIB                      March 2002


   Furthermore, some elements of the rohcCompressorTable and the
   rohcDecompressorTable belong to the rohcStatisticsGroup. They contain
   compression ratio indicatiors for each compressor context, packet
   counters per context, and reinitialization counters.

7.  Security Considerations

   The managed objects defined by the ROHC MIB are read-only with just
   one exception, the rohcCompressorReinit object. Therefore,
   unauthorized users getting access to the MIB via SNMP cannot cause
   harm to existing ROHC connections nor can they manipulate running
   instances of ROHC in a malicious way. The only effect they could
   achieve is reinitializing compressor contexts unnecessarily and
   thereby downgrading the performance.

   Another security issue is mis-use of he MIB for getting information
   about existing communication sessions. However, the only information
   that might be disclosed is the use of channels. Users and their
   addresses are not visible in the MIB. This information can only be
   mis-used in conjunction with the mis-use of further information.

   Although, the security risks arising from the ROHC MIB are not
   considered to be high, it is recommended for implementors and
   operators to apply the means for security offered by SNMPv3,
   particularly encryption of communication and the User-based Security
   Model described in [RFC2574].
