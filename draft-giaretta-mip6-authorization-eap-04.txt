Abstract 
    
   This draft defines an architecture, and related protocols, for 
   performing dynamic Mobile IPv6 authorization and configuration 
   relying on a AAA infrastructure. The necessary interaction between 
   the AAA server of the home provider and the mobile node is 
   realized using EAP, exploiting the capability of some EAP methods 
   to convey generic information items together with authentication 
   data. This approach has the advantage that the access equipment 
   acts as a simple pass-through for EAP messages and therefore does 
   not play any active role in the Mobile IPv6 negotiation procedure, 
   which makes the solution easier to deploy and maintain.

Internet-Draft     MIPv6 Authorization based on EAP       October 2006 
 
 
1. Introduction 
    
   Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775] requires that Mobile Nodes (MNs) and Home 
   Agents (HAs) share a set of configuration parameters: the MN must 
   know its Home Address, the Home Agent Address and the 
   cryptographic material needed to protect MIPv6 signaling (e.g. 
   shared keys or certificates to setup an IPsec security 
   association). MIPv6 base protocol does not specify any method to 
   automatically acquire this information; which means that network 
   administrators are normally required to manually set configuration 
   data on MNs and HAs. 
    
   Manual configuration of Home Agents and Mobile Nodes also works as 
   an implicit method for Mobile IPv6 authorization, because only the 
   users that have been administratively enabled on a specific Home 
   Agent are allowed to exploit Mobile IPv6 and its features. 
    
   However, in a large network (e.g. the network of a mobile 
   operator), which may include millions of users and many Home 
   Agents, the operational and administrative burden of this 
   procedure may easily become overwhelming. In addition, the 
   extensive use of manual and static configurations limits the 
   flexibility and reliability of the system, in that it is not 
   possible to dynamically assign the HA when the user enters the 
   network, which would help to optimize performance and resource 
   utilization (e.g. assignment of the HA closest to the MN’s point 
   of attachment). 
    
   This is generally referred to as the Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping 
   problem. As discussed in [RFC4640], several bootstrapping 
   scenarios can be identified depending on the relationship between 
   the network operator providing IP services to the MN (Access 
   Service Provider, ASP) and the service provider managing the HA 
   (Mobility Service Provider, MSP). This document describes a 
   solution to the bootstrapping problem that is applicable in a 
   scenario where the ASP and the MSP are the same provider 
   (Integrated ASP, IASP). 
    
   The proposed solution performs dynamic Mobile IPv6 authorization 
   and configuration together with MN authentication for network 
   access. MIPv6 negotiation and bootstrapping is controlled by the 
   AAA server of the home provider (IASP), that interacts with the 
   mobile node relying on AAA routing and EAP, exploiting the 
   capability of some EAP methods (e.g. PEAPv2 [PEAPv2], EAP-FAST 
   [EAP-FAST]) to convey generic information items together with 
   authentication data.

3. Protocol Overview 
    
   The basic idea behind the solution proposed herewith is to perform 
   Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping during the authentication procedure 
   undertaken by the Mobile Node to gain network access. 
   In particular, this draft defines a method to: 
    
   - explicitly authorize the use of Mobile IPv6 based on the service 
     profile of the user, its position within the network, etc. 
    
   - dynamically allocate a Home Agent to the Mobile Node; 
 
   - dynamically configure Mobile IPv6 start-up parameters (i.e. 
     MIPv6 bootstrapping) on the Mobile Node. These parameters 
     include the Home Address and the cryptographic material needed 
     to set-up the IPsec Security Association used to protect Mobile 
     IPv6 signaling (i.e. Binding Updates and Binding 
     Acknowledgements). 
 
   Figure 1 shows the overall architecture of the solution proposed 
   in this draft. The central element of the architecture is the AAA 
   server of the Home Domain (i.e. AAAH), which interacts with both 
   the MN and the selected HA to perform service authorization and 
   configuration.

                    Figure 1 - Solution architecture  
    
   The solution is applicable to any access network relying on EAP 
   [RFC3748] for user authentication and works with all EAP methods 
   supporting the exchange of general purpose information elements, 
   in any form (e.g. TLVs or AVPs), between EAP peers. Exploiting 
   this capability, MN and AAAH can piggyback Mobile IPv6 negotiation 
   messages within the same EAP conversation used to carry out user 
   authentication.

   This kind of operation is already supported by several tunneled 
   (e.g. PEAPv2 [PEAPv2]) and non tunneled (e.g. EAP-IKEv2 [EAP-
   IKEv2]) EAP methods, that also include native support for 
   encryption, authentication and integrity protection of exchanged 
   configuration data (e.g. HA address). 
 
   Figure 2 shows an overview of the procedure defined to handle 
   MIPv6 bootstrap on the Mobile Node. For the sake of simplicity it 
   is assumed that the employed AAA protocol is Diameter, but 
   obviously RADIUS is suitable as well.

   The whole procedure can be divided in six steps: 
    
   1. EAP identity exchange (i.e. exchange of EAP Request Identity and 
     EAP Response Identity messages); 
    
   2. set-up of a protected channel (e.g. TLS tunnel) for the delivery 
     of subsequent EAP signaling. This is an optional step that is 
     present only if the EAP method provides confidentiality support. 
     It is mandatory only if the MIPv6 negotiation procedure involves 
     the exchange of sensitive information; 
 
   3. authentication phase. The actual authentication procedure and 
     its security properties depend on the selected EAP method. In 
 
 
Giaretta, et al.              Expires - April 2007           [Page 6]

     tunneled EAP methods (e.g. PEAPv2) this step may involve one or 
     more complete EAP conversations occurring within a previously 
     negotiated TLS session. Each EAP conversation may accomplish 
     user authentication relying on any available EAP method (e.g. 
     EAP-MD5, EAP-SIM, EAP-AKA); 
 
   4. Mobile IPv6 service authorization and configuration. MN and AAAH 
     exchange a sequence of signaling messages to authorize and 
     configure Mobile IPv6. Those messages are encapsulated as 
     requested by the employed EAP method (e.g. TLVs or AVPs) and 
     delivered as part of the on-going EAP session. If the EAP method 
     provides confidentiality this protocol handshake is encrypted 
     using the previously negotiated ciphersuite. During this phase, 
     AAAH selects a suitable Home Agent for the MN and exchanges 
     authorization and configuration data with it using a AAAH-HA 
     protocol, whose specification is out of the scope of the present 
     document. Further analysis on the definition of such an 
     interface can be found in [AAAMIP6] and [AAAMIPFWK]. At the end 
     of this phase, the MN knows its own Home Address, the address of 
     the correspondent Home Agent, the peer authentication method 
     (i.e. certificates or pre-shared key) and the cryptographic 
     material (e.g. pre-shared key) needed to set-up an IPsec 
     security association with IKE [RFC2409]. The IKE pre-shared key 
     can be either constructed by AAAH and then delivered to MN in a 
     proper TLV (or AVP) or independently derived by MN and AAAH from 
     the EAP key hierarchy; 
 
   5. EAP session termination. Assuming the mobile node has been 
     successfully authenticated, the AAAH server sends a Diameter EAP 
     Answer message with Result-Code equal to SUCCESS. The AAA client 
     extracts the EAP Success message from the Diameter EAP Answer 
     and forwards it to the MN terminating the EAP session; 
 
   6. set-up of IPsec Security Association and MIPv6 registration. At 
     the end of the EAP communication, the MN gains network access 
     and acquires a valid Care-of Address within the visited subnet 
     (e.g. via stateless autoconfiguration); then it performs an IKE 
     exchange to establish the IPsec Security Association with the 
     HA, using the authentication method and the cryptographic 
     material negotiated during the MIPv6 service configuration phase 
     (step 4). Finally, the MN performs MIPv6 registration, sending a 
     Binding Update (protected with IPsec) to the HA. 
    
   This draft also defines the procedures to handle re-authentication 
   events and to manage the termination of the Mobile IPv6 session.  
    
   In summary, the proposed architecture has the following 
   advantages: 
    
   - allows the MSP to maintain a centralized management (on the AAA 
     server) of the user profiles and the authentication, 
     authorization and accounting procedures for any type of service, 
     including Mobile IPv6; 
    
   - improves the reliability and performance of the Mobile IPv6 
     protocol, in that the HA to be dynamically assigned to the MN 
     can be freely chosen among those that are closest to the user’s 
     point of attachment, thus optimizing network usage and reducing 
     the transfer delay for data traffic in bi-directional tunneling; 
 
   - can be deployed, or extended with new features, without having 
     to update the access equipment and the AAA protocols in use. 
     Only minor changes in the AAA servers, the Home Agents and the 
     mobile terminals are required, in that the AAA client does not

     play any active role in MIPv6 negotiation (i.e. it is a pass-
     through for EAP signaling). This reduces the deployment costs 
     and makes the solution easy to use even when a Mobile Node is 
     roaming with a provider different from its own; 
 
   - allows the usage of any AAA protocol supporting the transport of 
     EAP messages for the communication between the AAA client and 
     server (i.e. not just Diameter, but also RADIUS). This 
     significantly simplifies the deployment of MIPv6 in existing 
     communication networks, where support for Diameter protocol in 
     access equipment is not so extensive. 
 
   - allows the operator to dynamically choose the authentication 
     method for IKE bootstrapping and to automatically distribute the 
     pre-shared key eventually needed; in this way the pre-shared key 
     must not be pre-configured and can be frequently changed 
     increasing resistance to attacks. In the case of an EAP method 
     providing dynamic generation of keying material the pre-shared 
     key can be derived from EAP hierarchy avoiding the need to 
     explicitly send it to the MN [MIPv6AMSK].  
    
   As a whole, the solution adds a maximum of 2 RTTs (see the 
   detailed protocol description in section 5) to the EAP 
   conversation carried out by the mobile node to authenticate itself 
   and gain network access. The number of extra RTTs can be reduced 
   if the employed EAP method has the capability of transporting 
   MIPv6 negotiation TLVs (or AVPs) together with authentication 
   data. Nonetheless, it should be noted that the full negotiation 
   procedure can be undertaken by the MN only during its initial 
   bootstrapping, and therefore the performance requirements are not 
   so strict.

4. Requirements on EAP methods 
    
   In EAP methods, the EAP peer and EAP server exchange data in order 
   to authenticate the EAP peer and eventually the EAP server (mutual 
   authentication). This draft proposes the use of these exchanges to 
   transport MIPv6 parameters, as part of an handshake that requires 
   at maximum 2 RTTs. Thus, the main requirement for the 
   applicability of the solution is: 
    
   - the EAP method must provide a way to carry arbitrary parameters 
     during or after the authentication phase. This implies that the 
     EAP method must provide messages and mechanisms for this 
     purpose. 
    
   Then, for security reasons, the EAP method must provide the 
   following properties: 
    
   - mutual authentication: the EAP method must provide mutual 
     authentication. The access network must authenticate users   
     before granting them Mobile IPv6 service and the EAP peer should 
     authenticate the access network before delivering sensitive    
     data; 
 
   - integrity: the exchanged MIPv6 parameters must be protected 
     against any alteration and thus the EAP method must provide 
     integrity protection; 
    
   - replay protection: the EAP messages containing MIPv6 parameters 
     must be protected against Replay Attack, so that an attacker is 
     not able to get previous given data by replaying an old request; 
 
   - confidentiality: depending on which data the AAA server provides 
     to the mobile node (e.g. an IKE pre-shared key), it may be 
     necessary to protect the message exchange against eavesdropping. 
 
   The table below checks some existing EAP methods against the 
   requirements listed above.

   In summary, it is possible to note that the procedure described in 
   this draft can be successfully undertaken with several tunneled 
   (PEAPv2, EAP-FAST and EAP-TTLS) and non tunneled EAP methods (EAP-
   IKEv2, EAP-SIM, EAP-AKA), that all support the transport of 
   arbitrary parameters.

Internet-Draft     MIPv6 Authorization based on EAP       October 2006 
 
 
5. Detailed description of the Protocol 
    
   This section details the procedures and message exchanges that can 
   be adopted by the network operator to explicitly authorize the 
   activation of Mobile IPv6 support for a specific user as well as 
   enable dynamic bootstrapping of MIPv6 protocol parameters (e.g. 
   Home Address, Home Agent Address). 
    
5.1 Mobile node bootstrapping 
    
   If EAP is used for access control, when the MN enters the network 
   it is immediately polled for its identity, by means of an EAP 
   Request Identity message. This message is used to start the EAP 
   communication. The MN replies sending its identity, in the form of 
   a NAI (Network Access Identifier), within an EAP Response Identity 
   message, that is received by a AAA client (e.g. the Access Point 
   in the case of a Wireless LAN) and forwarded via AAA routing to 
   the AAAH server using the Diameter EAP Application (or the RADIUS 
   EAP extensions). Then the AAAH server selects an EAP method (e.g. 
   based on the user service profile) and proposes it to the MN in 
   subsequent EAP messages. In order to enable the Mobile IPv6 
   negotiation procedure defined in this document, the EAP method 
   chosen by the AAAH server must be an EAP method supporting the 
   transport of general purpose and variable length information 
   elements, in the form of TLVs (or AVPs), together with 
   authentication data (see section 4). 
    
   After this initial handshake, MN and AAAH undertake the actual 
   authentication phase, that may require the exchange of a variable 
   number of EAP Request/Response messages. In many EAP methods, like 
   PEAPv2 or EAP-IKEv2, the authentication phase is preceded by the 
   establishment of an encrypted channel between MN and AAAH that 
   provides protection capabilities (i.e. privacy, integrity 
   protection, etc.) for all the messages exchanged during the rest 
   of the EAP conversation. 
    
   As soon as the authentication phase is completed, the procedure 
   for MIPv6 bootstrapping may take place. For that purpose, the MN 
   and the AAAH server exploit the on-going EAP communication to 
   exchange a sequence of signaling messages transporting 
   configuration parameters. 
    
   All the messages used for MIPv6 bootstrapping are encoded in TLVs 
   carried by a generic MIPv6-Authorization container. This choice 
   simplifies a lot the deployment of the procedure with any EAP 
   method satisfying the requirements listed in section 4. In fact, 
   only the structure of the MIPv6-Authorization container needs to 
   be adapted to the actual message format of the employed EAP 
   method. 
    
   For the sake of simplicity, in this section it is assumed that the 
   EAP method used for network access authentication supports the 
   transport of arbitrary parameters in TLV format. In this case the 
   MIPv6-Authorization container becomes a MIPv6-Authorization-TLV. 
   Nonetheless, in section 7 the format of the container is defined 
   for all the EAP methods identified in section 4. 
    
   The whole bootstrapping procedure is depicted in Figure 3.

                Figure 3 - MIPv6 bootstrapping procedure                 
    
   AAAH starts the MIPv6 negotiation phase sending to the MN a MIPv6-
   Authorization-TLV including the following TLVs: 
    
   - Service-Status-TLV: used to communicate whether the home domain 
     is willing to provide Mobile IPv6 service to the MN. This might 
     depend on the user service profile or on other administrative 
     rules (e.g. service accountability); 
    
   - Service-Options-TLV (optional): used to specify other service 
     options the MN can ask for (e.g. allocation of a HA in the 
     visited domain). 
    
   MN replies to this first message confirming its intention to start 
   Mobile IPv6 and, optionally, providing a set of hints on the 
   desired service capabilities; this is achieved delivering a MIPv6-
   Authorization-TLV including the following TLVs: 
    
   - Service-Selection-TLV: used by the MN to specify if it is 
     willing to activate Mobile IPv6 protocol operation; 
    
   - Service-Options-TLV (optional): used by the MN to communicate 
     which service options, among those previously advertised by 
     AAAH, it would like make use of; 
 
   - Home-Agent-Address-TLV (optional): used by the MN to suggest a 
     preferred Home Agent. This can be a HA with whom the MN has a 
     pre-configured Security Association or a HA acquired through 
     dynamic HA address discovery. The AAAH server treats this 
     indication just as a hint, which means that, for administrative 
     reasons, the MN may be assigned a Home Agent different from the 
     one previously requested; 
 
   - Home-Address-TLV (optional): used by the MN to suggest a 
     preferred Home Address (e.g. an address pre-configured on one of

Internet-Draft     MIPv6 Authorization based on EAP       October 2006 
 
 
     its network interfaces); like the previous TLV, this indication 
     is considered only as a hint by the AAAH server; 
 
   - Interface-Identifier-TLV (optional): through this TLV, the MN 
     can suggest a preferred Interface Identifier (selected according 
     to [RFC3041] or following other criteria) to be used by the AAA 
     infrastructure to build the Home Address starting from the 
     selected home prefix. Also in this case, this information, if 
     present, is treated as a pure hint by the AAAH server. 
 
   - IKE-Authentication-Options-TLV (optional): through this TLV, the 
     MN communicates to the AAAH server in order of preference the 
     peer authentication methods it supports for IKE bootstrapping. 
     The lack of this TLV means that the MN supports only the default 
     method.  
    
   The solution described in this document supports the following 
   methods for peer authentication in IKE phase 1: 
    
   - use of a pre-shared key (PSK) derived by the AAAH server and 
     sent to the MN and the HA; in this case confidentiality must be 
     provided by both the AAAH-HA protocol and the EAP session 
     between the MN and the AAAH server. This is the default method. 
    
   - use of a pre-shared key independently derived by the MN and the 
     AAAH server from the keying material exported by the employed 
     EAP method. This key can be derived from an Application Master 
     Session Key (AMSK) specific to Mobile IPv6, which can be 
     constructed as explained in [MIPv6AMSK]. The PSK is then 
     delivered by the AAAH server to the HA by means of a AAAH-HA 
     protocol providing confidentiality; 
    
   - use of digital certificates. This solution involves the 
     employment of digital signatures and public key encryption as 
     stated in [RFC2409]. This method requires the availability of a 
     PKI.  
    
   If in the Service-Selection-TLV the MN has chosen not to make use 
   of Mobile IPv6, AAAH terminates the EAP communication sending an 
   EAP Success message, since the authentication procedure has been 
   accomplished successfully. 
    
   Otherwise, if the MN has confirmed its willingness to start MIPv6 
   service, AAAH selects a suitable Home Agent through a Home Agent 
   Selection Algorithm. Possible parameters to be taken into account 
   by this algorithm include: current load of available HAs (e.g. 
   number of active bindings), location of the MN and, eventually, 
   the preferences provided by the MN itself in the previous message 
   exchange (i.e. Service-Options-TLV, Home-Agent-Address-TLV, Home-
   Address-TLV, IKE-Authentication-Options-TLV). For example, based 
   on the knowledge of the MN's current point of attachment (i.e. the 
   current AAA client), the AAAH server may select, among the HAs 
   available in the home domain, the one that is closest to the MN in 
   terms of IP routing hops. This approach is normally expected to 
   improve performance. However, the detailed definition of a Home 
   Agent Selection Algorithm is out of the scope of this document. 
    
   After a suitable HA has been identified, the AAAH server selects 
   the peer authentication method to be used in IKE phase 1. The peer 
   authentication methods supported by the MN are known from the IKE-
   Authentication-Options-TLV received during the previous exchange. 
   If possible, the AAAH server should choose the method on top of 
   the list provided by the MN (i.e. the one with the highest 
   preference).

Internet-Draft     MIPv6 Authorization based on EAP       October 2006 
 
 
    
   As soon as the peer authentication method has been identified, the 
   AAAH server interacts with the HA to dynamically configure the 
   state needed to enable subsequent MIPv6 protocol operations, 
   including the authorization lifetime of the MIPv6 service granted 
   to the MN and the necessary security parameters (e.g. pre-shared 
   key). Possible protocols that can be used for this purpose include 
   Diameter (through a new Diameter Application), SNMPv3 or COPS-PR. 
   Further details about this communication are provided in section 
   6. Anyway, the detailed specification of the interface between 
   AAAH and HA is out of the scope of this document. Additional 
   considerations on the nature and goals of such an interface can be 
   found in [AAAMIP6] and [AAAMIPFWK]. 
    
   The security parameters that the AAAH server delivers to the HA 
   may vary depending on the peer authentication method chosen for 
   IKE bootstrapping: 
    
   - if the AAAH server selects pre-shared key as peer authentication 
     method it needs to send the chosen PSK (randomly generated or 
     derived from the EAP key hierarchy) to the HA together with the 
     associated lifetime; 
 
   - if the AAAH server selects a peer authentication method based on 
     certificates it does not need to derive keys nor to send 
     security parameters to the HA. 
    
   After the AAAH server has configured the state on the HA, it 
   continues the EAP session communicating to the MN all the MIPv6 
   configuration data it is waiting for. This is achieved delivering 
   to the MN an EAP Request containing a MIPv6-Authorization-TLV and 
   the following sub-TLVs: Home-Address-TLV (i.e. the home address), 
   Home-Agent-Address-TLV (i.e. the address of the HA), IKE-
   Bootstrap-Information-TLV (i.e. the peer authentication method to 
   be used in IKE phase 1 and associated cryptographic material) and 
   Authorization-Lifetime-TLV (i.e. the lifetime granted to the MN 
   for this session).  
 
   After the MN has received all the configuration data from the AAAH 
   server (i.e. HA address, Home Address and IKE bootstrap 
   information), it sends back an EAP Response containing a 
   Negotiation-Result-TLV, stating whether it accepts, or refuses, 
   the proposed arrangement. If the MN refuses the configuration, the 
   AAAH server should immediately release the resources previously 
   allocated on the Home Agent. 
    
   After the completion of the EAP session, MN holds all data needed 
   to perform Mobile IPv6 registration: the MN knows its Home 
   Address, the address of the correspondent Home Agent and all 
   cryptographic data needed to establish the IPsec security 
   association with it; furthermore, since it has been successfully 
   authenticated, the MN can acquire an IPv6 address to be used as 
   Care-of Address. 
    
   The first operation carried out by the MN after the acquisition of 
   the Care-of Address is the establishment of the IPsec Security 
   Association with the HA, that is mandated by [RFC3775] to protect 
   MIPv6 location update signaling. Set-up of the IPsec SA can be 
   accomplished following the procedure detailed in [RFC3776]. 
    
   As soon as the IPsec Security Association is established, MN can 
   send a Binding Update to the HA, thus starting up Mobile IPv6 
   service.

5.2 Management of re-authentication events 
    
   At the expiration of AAA session time-outs or after a change in 
   the point of attachment to the network (e.g. change of Access 
   Point), a re-authentication procedure is performed leading to the 
   user identity to be checked again along with its right to continue 
   exploiting network resources. To that purpose the AAAH server may 
   repeat a full authentication or, alternatively, decide to use 
   optimizations in order to make the procedure faster. Once this 
   phase is completed the AAAH server also undertakes the re-
   negotiation of the MIPv6 service. 
    
   Since the MIPv6 bootstrapping procedure is assumed to be 
   completely stateless, when a re-authentication event occurs the 
   AAAH server may not know the state of the MIPv6 service on the MN. 
   For this reason the AAAH server starts the MIPv6 negotiation like 
   in the bootstrapping case: it delivers a MIPv6-Authorization-TLV 
   containing a Service-Status-TLV and optionally a Service-Options-
   TLV. 
    
   If the MIPv6 service is not active on the MN the procedure 
   continues as described in section 5.1. Otherwise, the MN replies 
   with a MIPv6-Authorization-TLV containing a Service-Selection-TLV 
   indicating that the MIPv6 service is already in use. Furthermore, 
   the MN inserts the Home-Agent-Address-TLV, the Home-Address-TLV 
   and the IKE-Authentication-Options-TLV to inform the AAAH server 
   about its current state. The AAAH server can then get in touch 
   with the HA to check the integrity of the state, renew the MIPv6 
   authorization lifetime and eventually refresh the security 
   parameters. 
    
   If the peer authentication method used by the MN in IKE phase 1 is 
   pre-shared key, the AAAH server must derive a new PSK and send it 
   to the HA together with the associated lifetime. In case the PSK 
   is not derived from the EAP key hierarchy (i.e. it is randomly 
   generated by the AAAH server), the AAAH server must communicate it 
   also to the MN. Instead, in case of authentication based on 
   certificates, the AAAH server does not need to derive keys nor 
   deliver additional security data to the HA and the MN. 
    
   If the state on the HA is successfully updated, the AAAH server 
   terminates the EAP communication sending an EAP Success message. 
   Otherwise, the AAAH server should continue the EAP communication 
   renegotiating the MIPv6 service (i.e. allocation of a new HA and 
   related Home Address). 
    
   This solution can be easily deployed even within a network 
   including several AAA servers, each one managing a subset of the 
   available Network Access Servers (NASs). This is because the re-
   negotiation procedure does not assume to have any long term state 
   related to Mobile IPv6 stored on the AAAH server. In this way, 
   everything works correctly even if, due to MN's movements within 
   the network, the AAAH server that handles the re-authentication is 
   not the same server that authenticated the MN for the first time 
   and performed the MIPv6 bootstrapping procedure. 
    
   As explained above, the re-authentication events are normally 
   triggered by the network. Nonetheless, if the EAP lower layer 
   offers a way to trigger EAP re-authentications (e.g. PANA supports 
   this feature), it may be possible for the MN to re-negotiate the 
   MIPv6 service at any time.

6. Home Agent considerations 
    
   This section provides further thoughts about the AAAH-HA 
   communication and lists specific features that have to be 
   supported by the Home Agent to allow dynamic negotiation of Mobile 
   IPv6 protocol parameters. 
    
6.1 Requirements on AAAH-HA communication 
    
   This draft details only the message exchange between the MN and 
   the AAAH server. Obviously a complete Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping 
   solution requires also the definition of a mechanism for the 
   communication between the AAAH server and the Home Agent. Possible 
   protocols that may be used for this purpose include SNMPv3, COPS-
   PR or Diameter but a formal definition of such a protocol is out 
   of scope of this document.  
    
   A detailed analysis of the goals for a generic AAAH-HA protocol 
   can be found in [AAAMIP6]; in this section some requirements, 
   specific to this scenario, are highlighted.  
    
   The selected protocol should allow the AAAH server to: 
    
   - use a Network Access Identifier (NAI) to identify the mobile 
     node in the communication with the HA; 
 
   - send an authorization lifetime to the HA to limit Mobile IPv6 
     session duration for the MN; 
 
   - send to the HA a set of hints for the construction of the Home 
     Address (e.g. a preferred Home Address or a preferred Interface 
     Identifier); 
 
   - poll the designated HA for the allocation of a Home Address to 
     the MN; 
 
   - force the HA to terminate an active Mobile IPv6 session for 
     authorization policy reasons (e.g. credit exhaustion or 
     reallocation of a new HA to the MN); 
 
   - enforce explicit operational limitations and authorization 
     restrictions on the HA (e.g. packet filters, QoS parameters); 
 
   - retrieve the Mobile IPv6 state associated to a specific MN from 
     the correspondent HA. This may be useful to periodically verify 
     the Mobile IPv6 service status; 
 
   - send to the HA the security data needed to setup the IPsec SA 
     with the MN. Possible security data are the authentication 
     method and the cryptographic material to be used for IKE 
     bootstrapping.  
 
   Moreover, the protocol selected to implement the communication 
   between the AAAH server and the HA should fulfill the following 
   general requirements: 
    
   - the AAAH server and the HA must be able to authenticate each 
     other (mutual authentication) in order to prevent the 
     installation of unauthorized state on the HA; 
 
   - the AAA-HA interface must provide integrity protection in order 
     to prevent any alteration of exchanged data (e.g. Mobile IPv6 
     configuration parameters);

Internet-Draft     MIPv6 Authorization based on EAP       October 2006 
 
 
   - the AAA-HA interface must provide replay protection; 
 
   - the AAA-HA interface should provide confidentiality since it may 
     be used to transfer security parameters (e.g. IKE pre-shared 
     key); 
 
   - the AAA-HA interface should support inactive peer detection. 
     This functionality can be used by the AAAH server to maintain a 
     list of active HAs (e.g. useful for HA selection); 
 
 
6.2 Management of MIPv6 authorization state 
    
   The Home Agent is required to store some authorization data for 
   each of the MNs it is serving. A new data structure may be used 
   for this purpose and it should include at least the following 
   fields:  
    
   - NAI of the user; 
    
   - Home Address assigned to the MN; 
 
   - Cryptographic Data: this field includes the peer authentication 
     method to be used in IKE and, if needed, the pre-shared key and 
     its lifetime; 
 
   - Authorization Lifetime: it is the lifetime of the Mobile IPv6 
     service granted to the MN; 
 
   At the expiration of the Authorization Lifetime the HA should 
   check if there is an active entry for the MN in its Binding Cache 
   in order to verify if the MN is still using Mobile IPv6. If the 
   entry is available the Home Agent should negotiate with the AAAH 
   server an extension of the Authorization Lifetime granted to the 
   MN. Otherwise, the HA should immediately release the authorization 
   state associated to that MN and eventually notify the session 
   termination to the AAAH server (e.g. by means of a Session 
   Termination Request if the employed AAAH-HA protocol is Diameter). 
    
   Moreover, the release of the resources previously allocated on the 
   Home Agent can be undertaken at any time by the AAAH server. 
   Typically this happens at credit exhaustion or when the MN 
   disconnects from the network. 
    
   The policies adopted by the AAAH server to release the resources 
   allocated to the MN may vary depending on the user service 
   profile. For instance, the AAAH server may decide to postpone the 
   release of the resources on the HA in order to allow the MN to 
   continue using the Mobile IPv6 service even if it has moved to an 
   access network for which no roaming agreements are in place (e.g. 
   a corporate network or a network providing cost-free access). In 
   that case, the MN can continue to rely on the IPsec SA previously 
   negotiated with the HA and the respective authorization is managed 
   through the Mobile IPv6 Authorization Lifetime.

7. The MIPv6-Authorization container 
    
   All the messages used for MIPv6 bootstrapping are encoded in TLVs 
   carried by a generic MIPv6-Authorization container. In this way, 
   only the structure of the container needs to be adapted to the 
   actual message format of the employed EAP method. 
    
   The MIPv6-Authorization container can be implemented as a TLV, as 
   an AVP or in some other way depending on the specific 
   characteristics of the EAP method used for network access 
   authentication (see Figure 4).

           Figure 4 - Transport of MIPv6 bootstrapping messages      
    
   In the following the format of the MIPv6-Authorization container 
   is defined for each EAP method identified in section 4. This list 
   is not exhaustive and does not prevent the use of other EAP 
   methods satisfying all the requirements listed in this document. 
    
7.1 PEAPv2 
    
   The exchange of arbitrary information in PEAPv2 is based on EAP-
   TLVs. In this case the MIPv6-Authorization container is encoded as

8. New TLVs 
    
   Independently from the EAP method used for network access 
   authentication, the MIPv6-Authorization container enables to 
   transport a series of TLVs. This gives more flexibility to the 
   whole solution and permits the definition of new TLVs that do not 
   need to be bound to a specific EAP method. 
     
   The following TLVs have been defined so far: 
    
         Service-Status-TLV 
         Service-Selection-TLV 
         Service-Options-TLV 
         Home-Agent-Address-TLV 
         Home-Address-TLV

         IKE-Bootstrap-Information-TLV 
         Negotiation-Result-TLV 
    
    
8.1 Service-Status-TLV 
    
   This TLV is sent by the AAAH to inform the MN about the status of 
   Mobile IPv6 service. It is defined as follows: 
    
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0

   This TLV is sent by the MN to inform the AAAH whether it wants to 
   activate MIPv6 service or whether the service is already active.

8.3 Service-Options-TLV

9. Security Considerations 
    
   The Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping procedure described in this document 
   assumes the MN and the AAA server of the home domain exchange the 
   necessary parameters exploiting the EAP communication established 
   for network access authentication. Therefore, to secure the 
   bootstrapping procedure, the employed EAP method must support 
   mutual authentication as well as integrity and replay protection. 
    
   Moreover, if the pre-shared key needed to bootstrap the IPsec SA 
   with the Home Agent is not derived from the EAP key hierarchy but 
   explicitly delivered to the MN by the AAAH server, the EAP method 
   must also provide confidentiality. Several tunneled and non 
   tunneled EAP methods, like PEAPv2 and EAP-IKEv2, fulfill all of 
   these security requirements.
