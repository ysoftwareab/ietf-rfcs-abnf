            Subsequent Address Family Indicator for SDWAN Ports
                    draft-dunbar-idr-sdwan-port-safi-03

Abstract

   The document specifies a new BGP NLRI and SAFI for advertising WAN
   ports properties of a SDWAN edge node. SDWAN edge node's WAN ports
   may face untrusted networks, such as the public internet, may get
   assigned IP addresses from the Internet Service Providers (ISPs),
   may get assigned dynamic IP addresses via DHCP, or may have private
   addresses (e.g. inside third party Cloud DCs). Packets forwarded
   through those SDWAN WAN ports might need to be encrypted (depending
   on the user policies) or need to go through NAT. SDWAN edge nodes
   need to propagate those WAN ports properties to the peers who are
   authorized to communicate across different types of underlay
   networks including the untrusted networks.

   BGP Route Reflectors (RR) are proposed as the entities to propagate
   the WAN ports properties of SDWAN edge nodes to a controlled group
   of edges reachable via overlay networks.

1. Introduction

   [Net2Cloud-Problem] introduces using SDWAN to reach dynamic
   workloads in multiple third-party data centers and aggregate
   multiple underlay paths, including public untrusted networks,
   provided by different service providers.

   [SDWAN-BGP-USAGE] describes multiple SDWAN scenarios and how/why
   using BGP as control plane for the SDWAN networks.

   [Tunnel-Encap] describes how to construct a BGP UPDATE messages that
   advertise endpoints' tunnel encapsulation capabilities and the
   respective attached client routes, so that the receivers of the BGP
   UPDATE can establish appropriate tunnels to the endpoints for the
   aforementioined client routes. [Tunnel-Encap] has a "Remote endpoint
   subTLV" for one node to advertise another node's encapsulation
   capabilities. The receivers of the Tunnel UPDATE would construct the
   encapsulation header with the Outer Destination Address equal to the
   address carried in the "Remote Endpoint sub-TLV".  All those have
   nothing to do with the SDWAN Edge WAN ports properties registration.

   This document describes a new BGP NLRI and SAFI for SDWAN edge nodes
   to register (or propagate) their WAN ports properties. This new SAFI
   & NLRI is for a scenario where one SDWAN edge node has multiple WAN
   ports, some of which connected to private networks and others
   connected to public untrusted networks [Scenario #2 described in the
   [SDWAN-BGP-USAGE]]. The same routes attached to the SDWAN can be
   sent/received over the private networks without encryption (for
   better performance) and sent/received over the public networks with
   encryption.

   The [SDWAN-BGP-USAGE] document describes the following functional
   components of the control plane for the scenario (i.e. the SDWAN
   Scenario #2):

     . Each Edge SDWAN edge node is informed of its SDWAN controller,
       either burned in the node or configured, which is the BGP RR in
       this document.
     . Each SDWAN edge node needs to advertise its WAN ports properties
       via the secure channel with the RR.   RR then propagates the
       received WAN ports properties to the authorized peers based on
       appropriate policies. Because the connection among SDWAN edges
       and the RR can be public untrusted networks, the communication
       session between RR and SDWAN edges MUST run over a secure
       channel (e.g. TLS, DTLS, or others).

     . SDWAN edges pairwise secure channel establishment, such as IPsec
       parameters negotiation, public key exchange, etc, and

     . Client routes distribution, just like EVPN or L3VPN using
       [Tunnel-Encap] to advertise all possible tunnels for clients
       routes.

   The new SDWAN NLRI and SAFI can also include information such as WAN
   port's NAT information, SDWAN-SITE-ID, SDWAN EdgeNode-ID, and IPsec
   related information.

   Cloud DC:   Off-Premise Data Centers that usually host applications
               and workload owned by different organizations or
               tenants.

   Controller: Used interchangeably with SDWAN controller to manage
               SDWAN overlay path creation/deletion and monitor the
               path conditions between sites.

   CPE-Based VPN: Virtual Private Secure network formed among CPEs.

   SDWAN:      Software Defined Wide Area Network. In this document,
               "SDWAN" refers to the solutions of pooling WAN bandwidth
               from multiple underlay networks to get better WAN
               bandwidth management, visibility & control. When the
               underlay networks are private networks, traffic can be
               forwarded without additional encryption; when the
               underlay networks are public, such as Internet, some
               traffic needs to be encrypted when forwarding through
               those WAN ports(depending on user provided policies).



3. SDWAN NLRI Format

   The new SAFI code point 74 has been assigned by IANA as the
   Subsequent Address Family Identifier for advertising properties of
   WAN ports that face untrusted networks. Depending on user policies,
   some packets sent through those WAN ports will need encryption.

   The SDWAN SAFI (code point 74 assigned by IANA) uses a new NLRI
   defined as follows:

   +------------------+
   |   NLRI Length    | 1 octet
   +------------------+
   |   SDWAN-Type     | 2 Octets
   +------------------+
   |Port-Distinguisher| 4 octets
   +------------------+
   |  SDWAN-Site-ID   | 4 octets
   +------------------+
   |  SDWAN-Node-ID   | 4 or 16 octets
   +------------------+



   where:

     - NLRI Length: 1 octet of length expressed in bits as defined in
       [RFC4760].
     - SDWAN-Type: to define the encoding of the rest of the SDWAN
       NLRI.
     - Port Distinguisher: SDWAN edge node Port identifier. There can
       be many ports on a SDWAN edge node; each port can have different
       properties. For example, some ports may get ISP or DHCP assigned
       IP addresses (IPv4 or IPv6), some may have private IP addresses
       that packets to/from those ports have to traverse NAT.
       The detailed properties about the port are further encoded in
       the subsequent subTLVs, e.g. Port-subTLV.

     - SDWAN-Site-ID: used to identify a common property shared by a
       set of SDWAN edge nodes, such as the property of a specific
       geographic location shared by a group of SDWAN edge nodes.
     - SDWAN EdgeNode ID: the SDWAN edge node identifier, which can be
       the node's system ID or the loopback address (IPv4 or IPv6) of
       the SDWAN edge node.

   The content of the SDWAN Port properties is encoded in the Tunnel
   Encapsulation Attribute originally defined in [Tunnel-Encap] using a

   Where
       - NAT SubTLV is for describing additional information about the
          SDWAN tunnel end-points, such as NAT property.
       - IPsec-SA SubTLV is for the node to establish IPsec SA with
          other peers.
       - Port-subTLV is for additional properties of the WAN port.

3.1. SDWAN Route Type

   A new Route Type that defines the encoding of the rest of the SDWAN
   NLRI, and a set of sub-TLVs to specify its end-point attributes,
   policies associated with the Ports:


3.2. Port Distinguisher

   One (SDWAN Edge) node can have multiple ports, and each port can
   support multiple IPsec SA to different peers. The Port Distinguisher
   is to uniquely identify a port (or link).

   The property of the port are encoded in the subTLV attached to the
   SDWAN NLRI:

     a) The IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) & AS number of the Port
     b) NAT information for ports with Private IP address
     c) IPsec Security Association related information if the port is
        facing public network and traffic through which have to be
        encrypted.
   Detailed encoding for those properties is described in Section 3.4 &
   Section 3.5 respectively.

3.3. SDWAN Site ID

   SDWAN Site ID is used to identify a common property shared by a set
   of SDWAN edge nodes/ports, such as the property of a specific
   geographic location. The property is used to steer an overlay route
   to traverse specific geographic locations for various reasons, such
   as to comply regulatory rules, to utilize specific value added
   services, or others.



3.4. Extended Port Property

   EncapExt sub-TLV is for describing additional information about a
   SDWAN port, such as the NAT property if the port has private
   address, the network identifier that the port is part of, etc.

   A SDWAN edge node can inquire STUN (Session Traversal of UDP Through
   Network Address Translation RFC 3489) Server to get the NAT
   property, the public IP address and the Public Port number to pass
   to peers.

        has to be between 128~255 because IPsec-SA subTLV needs 2 bytes
        for length to carry the needed information.
     o IPsec-SA subTLV Length (2 Byte): 25 (or more)
     o Flags: 1 octet of flags. None are defined at this stage. Flags
        SHOULD be set to zero on transmission and MUST be ignored on
        receipt.
     o Transform (1 Byte):  the value can be AH, ESP, or AH+ESP.
     o Transport (1 byte): the value can be Tunnel Mode or Transport
        mode
     o AH (1 byte): AH authentication algorithms supported, which can
        be md5 | sha1 | sha2-256 | sha2-384 | sha2-512 | sm3. Each
        SDWAN edge node can have multiple authentication algorithms;
        send to its peers to negotiate the strongest one.
     o ESP (1 byte): ESP authentication algorithms supported, which
        can be md5 | sha1 | sha2-256 | sha2-384 | sha2-512 | sm3. Each
        SDWAN edge node can have multiple authentication algorithms;
        send to its peers to negotiate the strongest one. Default
        algorithm is AES-256.
     o SPI: 4 bytes
     o Key1.AH authentication key
     o Key2.ESP authentication key
     o Key3.ESP encryption "public" key
     o Duration: SA life span.

3.6. Remote Endpoint

   The Remote Endpoint sub-TLV is not used for SDWAN NLRI because
     o The SDWAN EdgeNode ID and Site ID are already encoded in the
        SDWAN NLRI,
     o The network connected by the SDWAN WAN port might have
        identifier that is more than the AS number. SDWAN controller
        might use its own specific identifier for the network.
     o The Transport-Network-ID in the EncapExt sub-TLV represents the
        SDWAN unique network identifier.

     If the Remote Endpoint Sub-TLV is present, it is ignored by other
     SDWAN edge nodes.


4. Operation of SDWAN Edge Node:

   Using Figure 1 as illustration, the processing steps to announce the
   SDWAN combination of routes, NAT and IPsec information via BGP are:


     1) Advertise the SDWAN port properties, such as Port identifiers
        and supported properties etc. to RR via the SDWAN SAFI NLRI.


     2) RR propagate the information to CPE2 & CPE 3.
     3) CPE2 and CPE3 can choose to establish IPsec SA with the CPE1
        after receiving the CPE1 WAN properties from RR.


   Note: Tenant separation is achieved by peer group policies on the
   RR.



4. Manageability Considerations

      TBD - this needs to be filled out before publishing

5. Security Considerations

     The document describes the encoding for SDWAN edge nodes to
     advertise its SDWAN WAN ports properties to their peers via
     untrusted & unsecure networks.

     The secure propagation is achieved by secure channels, such as
     TLS, SSL, or IPsec, between the SDWAN edge nodes and the local
     controller RR.

    [More details need to be filled in here]


6. IANA Considerations

   This document requires the following IANA actions.

       o SDWAN Overlay SAFI = 74 assigned by IANA
       o SDWAN Route Type
