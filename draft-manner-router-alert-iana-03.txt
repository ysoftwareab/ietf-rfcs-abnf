Internet-Draft    IANA Considerations for Router Alert          May 2008


1.  Introduction

   The IP Router Alert Option is defined for IPv4 in [RFC2113].  A
   similar IPv6 option is defined in [RFC2711].  When one of these
   options is present in an IP datagram, it indicates that the contents
   of the datagram may be interesting to routers.  The Router Alert
   Option (RAO) is used by protocols such as RSVP [RFC2205] and IGMP
   [RFC3376].

   Both the IPv4 and IPv6 option contain a two octet value field to
   carry extra information.  This information can be used, for example,
   by routers to determine whether or not the packet should be more
   closely examined by them.

   There can be up to 65536 values for the RAO.  Yet, currently there is
   only a registry for IPv6 values.  No registry or allocation policies
   are defined for IPv4.

   This document proposes updates to the IANA registry for managing IPv4
   and IPv6 Router Alert Option Values, and proposes to remove one
   existing IPv6 Router Alert Option value.


2.  Use of the Router Alert Option Value Field

   One difference between the specifications for the IPv4 and IPv6
   Router Alert Options is the way values for the value field are
   managed.  In [RFC2113], the IPv4 Router Alert Option value field has
   the value 0 assigned to "Router shall examine packet".  All other
   values (1-65535) are reserved.  Neither a management mechanism (e.g.,
   such as an IANA registry) nor an allocation policy are provided for
   the IPv4 RAO values.

   The IPv6 Router Alert Option has an IANA managed registry
   [IANA-IPv6RAO] containing allocations for the value field.

   In [RFC3175] the IPv4 Router Alert Option Value is described as a
   parameter that provides "additional information" to the router in
   making its interception decision, rather than as a registry managed
   by IANA.  As such, this aggregation mechanism makes use of the value
   field to carry the reservation aggregation level.  For the IPv6
   option, this document requests a set of 32 values to be assigned by
   IANA for indicating reservation levels.  However, since other
   registrations had already been made in that registry these values are
   from 3-35 (that is actually a set of 33 values).

   Although it might have been desirable to have the same values being
   used in both the IPv4 and IPv6 registries, the initial allocations in

   [RFC2711] and the aggregation level allocations in [RFC3175] have
   made this impossible.  The following table shows the allocations in
   the IPv6 registry and values used in the IPv4 registry, where the
   latter have been deduced from [RFC2113] and [RFC3175] with the
   assumption that the number of aggregation levels can be limited to 32
   as in the IPv6 case.  Entries for values 6 to 31 have been elided for
   brevity.

   inconsistency in the text of [RFC3175], and that is consequently
   reflected in the IANA registry.  In that document the values 3-35
   (i.e. 33 values) are defined for nesting levels 0-31 (i.e. 32
   levels).

   It is unclear why nesting levels begin at 1 for IPv4 (described in
   section 1.4.9 of [RFC3175]) and 0 for IPv6 (allocated in section 6 of
   [RFC3175]).


3.  IANA Considerations

   This section contains the proposed new procedures for managing IPv4
   Router Alert Option values.  This requires the creation of a registry
   for IPv4 Router Alert Option Values (described in Section 3.1) and
   updates the IPv6 Router Alert Option Values (described in
   Section 3.2).

   IP Router Alert Option values are currently managed separately for
   IPv4 and IPv6.  This should not change, as there has been seen little
   value in forcing the two registry to be aligned.

3.1.  IANA Considerations for IPv4 Router Alert Option Values

   The value field, as specified in [RFC2113] is two octets in length.
   The value field is registered and maintained by IANA.  The initial
   contents of this registry are:

    +-------------+--------------------------------------+-----------+
    | Value       | Description                          | Reference |
    +-------------+--------------------------------------+-----------+
    | 0           | Router shall examine packet          | [RFC2113] |
    | 1-32        | Aggregated Reservation Nesting Level | [RFC3175] |
    | 33-65502    | Available for assignment by the IANA |           |
    | 65503-65534 | Available for experimental use       |           |
    | 65535       | Reserved                             |           |
    +-------------+--------------------------------------+-----------+

   New values are to be assigned via IETF Review as defined in
   [RFC5226].

3.2.  IANA Considerations for IPv6 Router Alert Option Values

   The registry for IPv6 Router Alert Option Values should continue to
   be maintained as specified in [RFC2711].

   In addition, the following value should be removed from the IANA
   registry and reserved for possible future use (not to be allocated

   currently).  The reason is that it is a duplicate value, aggregation
   level 0 means end-to-end signaling, and this already has an IPv6 RAO
   value "1" assigned.

             +-------+--------------------------+-----------+
             | Value | Description              | Reference |
             +-------+--------------------------+-----------+
             | 3     | RSVP Aggregation level 0 | [RFC3175] |
             +-------+--------------------------+-----------+

   The following IPv6 RAO values should be made available for
   experimental use:

              +-------------+------------------+-----------+
              | Value       | Description      | Reference |
              +-------------+------------------+-----------+
              | 65503-65534 | Experimental use |           |
              +-------------+------------------+-----------+


4.  Security Considerations

   Since this document is only concerned with the IANA management of the
   IPv4 and IPv6 Router Alert Option values registry it raises no new
   security issues beyond those identified in [RFC2113] and [RFC2711].

   Yet, as discussed in RFC 4727 [RFC4727] production networks do not
   necessarily support the use of experimental code points in IP option
   headers.  The network scope of support for experimental values should
   carefully be evaluated before deploying any experimental RAO value
   across extended network domains, such as the public Internet.  The
   potential to disrupt the stable operation of the network hosting the
   experiment through the use of unsupported experimental code points is
   a serious consideration when planning an experiment using such code
   points.

   When experimental RAO values are deployed within an administratively
   self-contained network domain, the network administrators should
   ensure that each value is used consistently to avoid interference
   between experiments.  When experimental values are used in traffic
   that crosses multiple administrative domains, the experimenters
   should assume that there is a risk that the same values will be used
   simultaneously by other experiments and thus that there is a
   possibility that the experiments will interfere.  Particular
   attention should be given to security threats that such interference
   might create.
