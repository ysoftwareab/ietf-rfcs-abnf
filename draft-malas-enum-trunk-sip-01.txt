Internet-Draft           Trunk Group Use in ENUM            October 2009


1.  Introduction

   ENUM (E.164 Number Mapping, [RFC3761]) is a system that transforms
   E.164 numbers into SIP URIs and then uses DNS [RFC1034] features such
   as delegation through NS records, or the use of Naming Authority
   Pointer (NAPTR) records, to provide the communication services
   available for a specific domain name.  This draft refers to the
   resulting SIP enumservice NAPTR record type received by an ENUM
   client request.  Simplified methods for provisioning call routing
   data in ENUM servers have developed a desire among SIP Service
   Providers (SSPs) to manage all call routing data in an ENUM database
   versus managing some call routing in both ENUM and DNS.

   The use of trunk groups is well described in [RFC4904] for IP to PSTN
   gateway scenarios.  In addition to this trunk group usage, more and
   more SIP service providers (SSPs) are defining trunk groups as SIP IP
   network end-points.  This can be thought of as a SIP trunk group.
   While there have been other attempts to define a SIP trunk group, in
   this draft, they are simply referred to as an IPv4/v6 address or a
   fully qualified domain name (FQDN) representing the target SIP UA or
   proxy.  In addition, SIP trunk groups are becoming popular for
   defining an associated egress Signaling Path Border Element (SBE) for
   preferred routing to a peer's ingress SBE.

Internet-Draft           Trunk Group Use in ENUM            October 2009


   The above figure illustrates the problem.  SSP1 has two options to
   send a request to SSP2.  For reasons outside the scope of this draft,
   SSP1 would prefer to use SBE2 to send a request to SSP2.  Based on
   the information from SSP2, an example ENUM response for SSP1 would
   look something like the following:

   $ORIGIN 8.4.1.0.6.4.9.7.0.2.4.4.e164.arpa.
      NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U+sip" "!^.*$!sip:\1@sbe3.ssp2.example.com!" .


   While SSP1 can use a subsequent private DNS look-up on
   sbe3.ssp2.example.com to discover and manipulate a preferred call
   routing path to SBE3, it prefers to use defined trunk group
   parameters to specify SBE2 as the egress point to reach SBE3.  Trunk
   group use is especially applicable if SSP2 uses an IPv4/v6 address to
   specify SBE3 with no additional DNS look-ups to discover the
   preferred path via SBE2.  This draft defines a method for SSP1 to
   determine the preferred call routing path to reach SBE3 through the
   results of an ENUM query.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Additional terms used in this document for describing aspects of the
   problem and solution are defined in RFC 5486 [RFC5486].

1.2.  Trunk use in the 'E2U+SIP' enumservice URI

   The following example shows how the'trunk group' parameters are
   returned in the existing 'SIP' ENUM service type.

   NOTE: The NAPTR records shown in this section are intended for
   illustration purposes only, and are not intended as good examples of
   how to do ENUM provisioning.

   Example:

   $ORIGIN 8.4.1.0.6.4.9.7.0.2.4.4.e164.arpa.
      NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U+sip"  "!^.*$!sip:\1;tgrp=TG-1;
                   trunk-context=+44-207@sbe1.example.com;user=phone!" .
      NAPTR 10 101 "u" "E2U+sip"  "!^.*$!sip:\1;tgrp=TG-2;
                   trunk-context=+44-207@sbe2.example.com;user=phone!" .

   In this example, the additional 'trunk' parameters defined in
   [RFC4904] are included in the SIP URI NAPTR response.  Since, the

   result of the query provides a URI response for the Service field
   'E2U+sip', the client now has all of the information available to it
   to route the call.  The following figure and subsequent explanation
   illustrates this in more detail:

   In the above figure, SSP2 notifies SSP1 to reach +442079460148, send
   your SIP request to sbe3.ssp2.example.com.  SSP1 decides it prefers
   to send all requests to sbe3.ssp2.example.com via SBE2.  In order to
   do this, it assigns a trunk group to SBE2.  The trunk group, for
   example purposes, is SBE3-SSP2.  The Trunk Context is
   sbe2.ssp1.example.com.  In order for the request to be routed
   correctly from SBE2 to SSP2, there is a logical association on SBE2
   to interpret sbe3-ssp2 to sbe3.ssp2.example.com.  The trunk group and
   context are provisioned into the ENUM server, so when the Proxy (in
   this example, also the ENUM client) queries for +442079460148 it
   receives the following response:

   $ORIGIN 8.4.1.0.6.4.9.7.0.2.4.4.e164.arpa.
      NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U+sip"  "!^.*$!sip:\1;tgrp=SBE3-SSP2;
               trunk-context=sbe2.ssp1.example.com
                                   @sbe3.ssp2.example.com;user=phone!" .

Internet-Draft           Trunk Group Use in ENUM            October 2009


   If SSP1 desires SBE1 to be a fail-over solution to SBE2, then this
   would be an example response:

   $ORIGIN 8.4.1.0.6.4.9.7.0.2.4.4.e164.arpa.
      NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U+sip"  "!^.*$!sip:\1;tgrp=TG1-SBE3-SSP2;
                     trunk-context=sbe2.ssp1.example.com
                                   @sbe3.ssp2.example.com;user=phone!" .
      NAPTR 10 101 "u" "E2U+sip"  "!^.*$!sip:\1;tgrp=TG2-SBE3-SSP2;
                     trunk-context=sbe1.ssp1.example.com
                                   @sbe3.ssp2.example.com;user=phone!" .

   In the above fail-over solution a logical association to
   sbe3.ssp2.example.com would be required on both SBE1 and SBE2.

1.3.  Why Not Create a new ENUM Service Type?

   One method for identifying a trunk group in ENUM could be to define a
   new service type "trunk".  This new service type would return a tel
   URI containing the "tgrp" and "trunk context" parameters that can
   then be carried in IP signaling to control trunk group selection in
   downstream gateways.  While this new ENUM service type may work in
   production environments, it places an unnecessary burden on ENUM
   clients to either assume a trunk group exists by always initiating a
   second ENUM query for the "trunk" service type, or evaluating the
   entire list of NAPTRs in the response for additional service types,
   potentially beyond what it originally queried for.

   An evaluation of [RFC3402], [RFC3403], and [RFC5483] reveals there is
   no clear definition that says an ENUM client MUST only determine the
   use of one returned NAPTR and ignore any other NAPTRs returned by the
   server.  While this may be true, it can also be argued that an ENUM
   client will only choose one NAPTR (and ignore the rest) after
   evaluating the Services field value, along with the ORDER and
   PREFERENCE/PRIORITY values, and assuming the NAPTR identifies an
   acceptable URI that is not rejected by the client due to some other
   circumstance.  Assuming the ENUM client accepts a NAPTR based on this
   criteria, it is possible a client may never evaluate additional
   service field values.

   This is illustrated in the following example of a client querying the
   server for a SIP URI available for the telephone number
   +442079460148.  The example illustrates a potential additional
   service type mechanism, where the trunk group parameters are returned
   in a new ENUM 'trunk' service type.

   NOTE: The NAPTR records shown in this section are intended for
   illustration purposes only, and are not intended as good examples of
   how to do ENUM provisioning.

Internet-Draft           Trunk Group Use in ENUM            October 2009


   The following example illustrates a potential scenario indicating how
   an ENUM client MAY not ever evaluate a NAPTR with the 'trunk' service
   type.

   $ORIGIN 8.4.1.0.6.4.9.7.0.2.4.4.e164.arpa.
     NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U+sip"  "!^.*$!sip:\1@sbe3.ssp2.example.com!" .
     NAPTR 10 101 "u" "E2U+sip"  "!^.*$!sip:\1@sbe3.ssp2.example.com!" .
     NAPTR 11 100 "u" "E2U+trunk" "!^.*$!trunk:sip\1;tgrp=SSP2-SBE3;
                     trunk-context=sbe2.ssp1.example.com
                                   @sbe3.ssp2.example.com;user=phone!" .

   In this example, the ENUM client will likely select the first NAPTR,
   because of a match on the queried Services field value, and the ORDER
   and PREFERENCE/PRIORITY value.  It will never evaluate the 'trunk'
   NAPTR unless the previous two fail for some other circumstance.  Even
   if the client does not specify a service in the original query, the
   ENUM client will likely choose one of the first two NAPTRs due to the
   inherent choice based on the clients understanding of the preferred
   service.  In order for the client to choose the 'trunk' NAPTR, it
   would need to either evaluate two NAPTRs in the response based on a
   client configuration to look for both, or it would have to place a
   query specifically for the 'trunk' service regardless of knowing
   whether trunk parameters exist or not.  This is due to the fact the
   client will always have to assume trunk parameters exist as to avoid
   routing failures due to not having the complete information
   associated with the destination SIP URI.

   It is recognized that one potential option is to change the order of
   the service types to process the 'trunk' service type first.  While
   more and more SIP user agents are supporting ENUM clients, they are
   only supporting a subset of ENUM service types (primarily SIP).
   Adding a new service requires two changes to the SIP ENUM client

   o  it needs to support the new URI type (in this case 'trunk:'), and

   o  a new ENUM service type and processing logic.

   Eliminating the new service type in favor of embedding the parameters
   in the SIP URIs now only requires the SIP ENUM client to support the
   URI extensions with no impact to how it processes NAPTR records or
   how it queries the ENUM server.

1.4.  ENUM Client, Proxy, and User Agent Considerations

   It should not be assumed the originating proxy or user agent (UA),
   acting as the ENUM client, will perform an action based on the
   received trunk group information.  With this in mind, it is
   recommended that if the proxy or UA does not know how to interpret or

   act on the trunk group parameters it should simply forward the URI as
   received from the ENUM server to the next downstream SIP signaling
   element.
