Abstract

   This document abolishes the existing form of indefinite Posting
   Rights Action and restores the previous option of finite posting
   rights suspensions authorized by an Area Director.  It obsoletes RFC
   3683 and updates RFC 2418 and RFC 3934.

1.  Posting Rights

   BCP 83 [RFC3683] has been found troublesome and contentious in
   practice.  It is hereby rescinded.  Any suspensions in place under
   BCP 83 at the time of approval of this document are not affected.

   BCP 94 [RFC3934] has been interpreted as removing the option of
   progressively increasing the length of posting rights suspensions, as
   implicitly allowed by BCP 25 [RFC2418] section 3.2.  Suspensions
   longer than one month have been found to be necessary, so [RFC3934]
   shall not be interpreted to prevent the Area Director, with the
   approval of the IESG, from authorizing posting rights suspensions of
   increasing length upon the request of a Working Group Chair, i.e.,
   the Area Director's power under [RFC2418] section 3.2 is reinstated
   at the time of approval of this document.


2.  Security Considerations

   This document does not directly affect the security of the Internet.


3.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request for IANA assignments.


4.  Acknowledgements

   John Leslie contributed about half the substantive text.

   This document was produced using the xml2rfc tool [RFC2629].
