                  draft-xiong-dmm-ip-reachability-01	


Abstract

   In distributed mobility management (DMM) environment, the mobile node
   (MN) has more than one IP addresses and can use different IP address
   to communicate with different hosts.

   When a new correspondent node (CN) initials an IP session with MN,
   the CN needs to find and select one of the MN's IP addresses to
   provide best performance (e.g. with low delay) for the IP session.

   This draft analyses the existing mechanisms for IP reachability in a
   distributed mobility management environment, and identifies the key
   procedures or enhancements to support the routing-optimized IP
   reachability in a distributed mobility management environment.

INTERNET DRAFT       MN IP reachability for the DMM    February 12, 2014


1.  Introduction

   In distributed mobility management (DMM) environment, the mobile node
   (MN) has more than one IP addresses and can use different IP address
   to communicate with different hosts. When a new correspondent node
   (CN) initials an IP session with MN, the CN needs to find and select
   one of the MN's IP addresses to best (e.g. with low delay) for the IP
   session.

   This draft analyses the existing mechanisms for IP reachability in a
   distributed mobility management environment, and identifies the key
   procedures or enhancements to support the routing-optimized IP
   reachability in a distributed mobility management environment. This
   draft tries to find out whether there are technical issues blocking
   the current existing IP reachability mechanism to be routing-
   optimized in a distributed mobility management environment, then try
   to find out how to change or enhance the current existing IP
   reachability mechanism to be routing-optimized if there are some
   technical issues. This draft does not define or provide new IP
   reachability mechanism for the distributed mobility management
   environment but can provide some guidance to define new IP
   reachability mechanisms for the distributed mobility management
   environment.

   Currently, there are two main IP reachability solutions to find and
   select of MN's IP Addresses, one is DDNS[RFC 2136]-based solution
   that MN registers its new IP address to a DDNS server, and CN obtains
   the MN's new IP address info from the DDNS server, and then initials
   an IP session to the MN.  The other is Application Server Register-
   based solution that MN and CN both register their new IP addresses
   and ports info to the same application server for a given service or
   application, e.g., MSN messenger and there are three sub-methods for
   CN to obtain the MN's IP address info and initial an IP session to
   the MN, which are P2P mode, server central mode, and combined mode.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Problem Statement

   In distributed mobility management (DMM) environment, the mobile node
   (MN) has more than one IP addresses to communicate with other hosts.
   The MN initials a new IP session with a new CN via the MN's latest IP
   address and the IP path between the MN and CN are routing-
   optimized[I-D.ietf-dmm-requirements].However, when a new
   correspondent node(CN) initials a new IP session with the MN, the CN
   doesn't know how to choose the MN's latest IP address to ensure the
   IP path between the CN and the MN is routing-optimized. so the IP
   reachability in the distributed mobility management is how a new CN
   finds out and chooses the MN's latest IP address to initial a new
   routing-optimized IP session with the MN.

   As described in figure 1, firstly the MN attaches to the MR1 and
   address IP1 is allocated to the MN by the MR1, then the MN initials a
   new IP session with the CN1 through the MR1 via the address IP1.after
   the MN moves to the MR2 and IP2 is allocated to the MN by the MR2,the
   MN initials another new IP session with CN2 using IP2, at the same
   time, the IP session between the MN's IP1 and CN1 are kept
   continuity, after that, a new CN3 wants to initial a new IP session
   with the MN, the IP reachability issue needs to be solved: How the
   CN3 to get the MN's latest IP address to ensure the new IP session
   between the CN3 and the MN is routing-optimized ?

INTERNET DRAFT       MN IP reachability for the DMM    February 12, 2014


4.  Solutions Analysis

   Currently, there are two main IP reachability solutions to find and
   select of MN's latest IP Address, one is DDNS[RFC 2136]-based
   solution that MN registers its new IP address to a DDNS server, and
   CN obtains the MN's latest IP address info from the DDNS server.  The
   other is Application Server Register-based solution that MN and CN
   both register their latest IP address and ports info to the same
   application server for a given service or application, then the CN
   obtains the MN's latest IP address info from the application server.

4.1  Solution1 Analysis: DDNS server-based solution

   In this solution, each MN has a global unique ID (GUID), e.g. FQDN
   [RFC4703] , and a DDNS server stores the MN's latest IP address with
   the MN's GUID.As described in figure 2, when the MN attaches to MR1
   and gets an IP address IP1 from the MR1, the MN registers its latest
   IP address i.e. IP1,and MN's GUID to the DDNS server. The MN initials
   a new IP session with CN1 via its latest IP address IP1, after the MN
   moves and attaches to the MR2, and gets a new IP address IP2 from the
   MR2, the MN immediately refreshes its DDNS registration with its
   latest IP address IP2 and the same MN GUID to the DDNS server, If the
   MN initials a new IP session with the new CN2, the MN uses its latest
   IP address IP2 to setup the IP session to the CN2 to ensure the new
   IP session is routing-optimized. At the same time, the IP session
   between the MN's IP1 and CN1 are kept IP session continuity via the
   distributed mobility management procedure.

   If a new CN3 initials a new IP session with the MN, firstly CN3 has
   to requests the MN's IP address from DDNS server with the MN GUID,
   and DDNS Server responses with the registered MN's IP address, then
   the CN3 directly initials to setup a new IP session to the MN with
   the retrieved MN's IP address. If the retrieved MN's IP address is
   the latest IP address of the MN, then the new IP session between the
   CN3 and MN is routing-optimized, otherwise, it is not. So the key
   requirement for the DDNS-based IP reachability solution is that the
   MN needs to register its latest IP address to the DDNS server.

   But the DNS cache mechanism to improve the DNS query speed makes the
   things more complex. For example, after the CN3 has got the MN IP
   address IPx from the DDNS Server with the MN GUID, the CN3 usually
   caches the IPx with MN GUID with a defined timer, if before the timer
   expires, the MN has refreshed the DDNS server with its new latest IP
   address IPy and the CN3 initials another new IP session, the CN3
   still uses the cached IPx to setup the new IP session, this new IP
   session is not routing-optimized, for the DDNS-based IP reachability
   solution either the CN3 disable its DNS cache function or the DDNS
   server indicates that the DNS response can't be cached or is  with a

   very short validate time (e.g. 200ms).

   It seems that the DDNS-based IP reachability solution is very simple
   and workable in the distributed mobility management, but there still
   needs some additional functions or mechanism to support for this
   solution:

   1) There needs a mechanism/procedure to allocate a permanent GUID for
   each MN, currently, not each GUID is allocated for a MN permanently.
   In the mobile telecommunication system, e.g. 3GPP system, a global
   unique MSISDN (Mobile Station Integrated Services Data Network) is
   allocated to each mobile node.

   2) A reliable DDNS Server is needed for the MN to register its latest
   IP address and for the CN to query the MN's latest IP address.

   3) There still needs a way (out scope of this draft) for a CN to
   acquire the MN GUID and the MN registered-DDNS server address before
   the CN wants to initial a new IP session to the MN.

4.2  Solution2 Analysis : Application Server Registration-based solution

   In this solution, for an application or service, e.g., MSN Messenger,
   the MN and the CN both register their IP address and (TCP/UDP) port
   info to the same (virtual or physical) application server. After

   moving and attaching to a new MR, the MN gets a new and latest IP
   address from the new MR, the MN refreshes its registration with its
   new IP address and port info to the application server immediately or
   some time later again depended on the application status of the MN.
   There are three mode for the CN to initial a new IP session with the
   MN, which is including P2P mode[RFC 5694], Server central mode and
   Combined mode.


4.2.1  P2P mode

   As described in figure 3, firstly the CN3 has registered its IP
   address and Port info to the same application server as the MN. If
   the CN3 wants to initial a new IP session with the MN, the CN3 sends
   "service request to the MN" message to the application server. In
   this request message, the MN is identified by the application-
   specific ID, e.g. Messenger Name of the MN. The application server
   searches and finds out the MN application context indexed by the MN's
   application ID and gets the MN's registered IP address and port info
   and responses the MN registered IP address and port info to the CN3,
   then the CN3 directly setup a new IP session to the MN by connecting
   to the retrieved MN's IP address and port info. When the MN moves and
   attaches to a new MR2 and get a new IP address IP2 from the MR2, the
   MN can immediately refreshes the application server with the new IP
   address IP2 even when the established IP session between the CN3 and
   the MN is still running and the IP session continuity is kept.

   However, a lot of applications have a separate user plane and control
   plane, i.e. a different IP + Port is used for the application's user
   plane and control plane respectively. For example, the MN can
   register IP1+Port1 for the control plane and dynamically allocates
   IP2+Port2 for the user plane with a host (e.g. SIP/WebRTC/IMS
   service), or the MN can register the IP2+Port1 for the control plane
   and dynamically allocates IP2+Port2 for the user plane with a host.
   For Application Server Registration-based P2P mode, it is required
   that the MN registers the same latest IP address and port number for
   the control plane.

   It seems that the Application Server Registration-based P2P solution
   is almost the same as the DDNS-based solution, As described in the
   DDNS-based solution, the CN needn't to cache the retrieved MN IP
   address and Port info, if the CN wants to initial another new IP
   session with the MN, the CN just request the application server and
   gets the MN's latest registered IP address and port info from the
   application server.

   Based on the above description, it can found out that the Application
   Server Registration-based solution has more advantages than the DDNS-

   based solution: 

   1)In DDNS-based solution, there needs a mechanism/procedure to
   allocate a permanent GUID for each MN. In Application Server
   Registration-based solution, the MN (also the CN) is assigned a
   unique ID by the application server.

   2) In DDNS-based solution, a reliable DDNS Server is needed for the
   MN to register its latest IP address and for the CN to query the MN's
   latest IP address. In Application Server Registration-based solution,
   the Application server is always available for the MN and the CN.

   3)In DDNS-based solution, there still needs a way (out scope of this
   draft) for a CN to acquire the MN GUID and the MN registered-DDNS
   server address before the CN wants to initial a new IP session to the
   MN. In Application Server Registration-based solution, the MN and the
   CN can be included in each other's buddy list or can be found out
   each other by the search function of the application.

   "Service Request to the MN" message to the application server. In
   this request message, the MN is identified by the application-
   specific ID, e.g. Messenger Name of the MN. The application server
   responses the server's IP address and port info to the CN3, the CN3
   initiate a new IP session to the received the application server's IP
   address and the port info. At the same time, the application server
   searches and finds out the MN application context indexed by the MN's
   application ID, and gets the MN's registered IP address and port info
   and initiates a new IP session to the MN via the MN's registered IP
   address and port info. After both the IP session between the CN3 and
   the Server and the IP session between the application server are
   established, and the application server forwarding the application
   data between the two IP sessions, the communication between the CN3
   and the MN is established. From the CN3 side, it thinks it setups a
   new IP session with the MN, and for the MN side, it thinks a new IP
   session is established with the CN3, in fact, the IP session is not
   directly established, the application server acts as an application
   proxy for the CN3 and the MN's IP session. So this method of
   establishing a new IP session between the CN and the MN is named as
   Application Server Registration-based server central solution.

   If a server-central mode IP session between MN and CN1 is established
   via the MN's IP1 when the MN attaches to the MR1, after the MN moves
   and attaches to a new MR2 and get a new IP address IP2 from the MR2,
   the MN can't immediately refreshes the registration to the
   application server with the new IP address IP2 if there is a
   established IP session for the MN, otherwise the established server-
   central mode IP session between CN1 and MN is interrupted. So if the
   CN3 wants to initiate a new server-central mode IP session to the MN,
   the new IP session is established via the MN's old IP1 instead of the
   new IP2, so the new IP session isn't routing optimized. However, for
   the application with a separate user plane and control plane, the MN
   can't immediately refreshes the registration to the application
   server with the new IP address IP2 if there is a established IP
   session for the MN , but the MN can dynamically allocates IP2+Port2
   for the user plane with the CN3,i.e. that the new IP session with CN3
   are combined with IP1+Port1 in control plane and IP2+Port2 in user
   plane, in this method, the new IP session is partly routing-optimized
   between the application server and the MN. Because the Application
   Server Registration-based server central solution can't provide
   routing optimization or only provide partly routing optimization, it
   is not preferred method to establish an IP session in a distributed
   mobility management environment.

                          Server central mode

4.2.3  Combined mode

   The Application Server Registration-based Combined mode is using the
   Server Central mode to discover the MN's control plane IP and port
   info and using P2P mode to establish the user plan IP session. As
   described in figure 5, firstly the CN3 has registered its IP address
   and Port info to the same application server as the MN. If the CN3
   wants to initial a new IP session with the MN, the CN3 sends "Service
   Request to the MN" message to the application server (in this control
   plane). In this request message, the MN is identified by the
   application-specific ID, e.g. Messenger Name of the MN. Then the
   application server forwards the request message to the MN based on
   the MN's registration information (in the MN's control plane),the MN
   responses to the application server with MN's user plane IP and Port
   info and the application server forwards the MN's responses to the
   CN3, the CN3 initiate a new IP session for the user plane data and
   keeps the control IP session with the application server and the MN.

   If a Combined mode user plane IP session between MN and CN1 is
   established via the MN's IP1 when the MN attaches to the MR1, after
   the MN moves and attaches to a new MR2 and get a new IP address IP2
   from the MR2, the MN can't immediately refreshes the registration to
   the application server with the new IP address IP2 if there is a
   established IP session for the MN, otherwise the established server-
   central mode IP session between CN1 and MN is interrupted. So if the
   CN3 wants to initiate a new combined mode IP session to the MN, the

   MN's uses the old and shared control plane IP session with CN1 to
   provide the MN's user plane IP2+Port2 info to the CN3, then the new
   user plane IP session between the CN3 and MN is established via the
   MN's latest IP2.In Combined method, the new user plane IP session is
   routing-optimized but the control plane is not routing optimized, and
   because the traffic in the control plane is some minor, so the
   control plane's non-routing optimization can be ignored.

4.3  Analysis Summary 

   Based on the above analysis, most of the current IP reachability
   solution can be used in a distributed mobility management
   environment. The main conclusion are: 1)The DDNS-based and
   Application Server Registration-based P2P mode solution can provide
   IP session routing optimization if the MN refreshes the registration
   of the DDNS/application server immediately after the latest IP
   address is allocated to the MN.

   2)The Application Server Registration-based Combined mode solution
   can provide user plane IP session routing optimization and the
   control plane isn't routing optimized if the MN provides the latest
   IP address for the user plane IP session. Since the traffic of the
   control plane is minor, so the Application Server Registration-based
   Combined mode solution is regard as a good routing optimization
   solution.

   3)The Application Server Registration-based Server central solution
   can't provide routing optimization or only provide half segmentation
   routing optimization between the application server and the MN, so
   this method should not be used.

   This draft only analyzes the current well-known IP reachability
   methods without considering the special DMM framework or DMM
   protocols or any special application (e.g. broadcast or multicast).
   The draft needs to be updated with new and good IP reachability
   methods or after DMM protocols are defined or some special
   applications are supported in the DMM environment.
