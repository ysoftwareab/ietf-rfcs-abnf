Abstract

   Accessing the Internet via mobile data services using smartphones, 
   tablets, and mobile data USB dongles has increased rapidly, as 
   high-speed packet data networks provide the bandwidth required for 
   today's Internet applications. Mobile operators will continue to 
   evolve their core networks to the Long Term Evolution (LTE) 
   Evolved Packet Core (EPC) to meet the mobility, latency and 
   bandwidth requirements for mobile data users. 
    
   Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) looks to reduce mobile core  
   network complexity and related operational issues by leveraging 
   standard IT virtualization technologies and consolidate different 
   types of network equipment onto commodity hardware. 
     
   This use case document provides resiliency requirements for 
   virtualization of the LTE mobile core network, known as virtualized 
   EPC (vEPC).

1. Introduction

   Mobile operators have deploying Long Term Evolution (LTE) Evolved 
   Packet Core (EPC) to meet the mobility, latency and bandwidth 
   requirements for a variety of mobile data users. The EPC is the 
   latest evolution of the [3GPP-R8] core network architecture, and is 
   based on IP. 
   
   The EPC architecture is said to have a "flat architecture" with 


King et al.               Expires July, 2015                   [Page 2]
Internet Draft        Virtualisation of Mobile Network     January 2015


   minimal components and functions. Principally the design is 
   intended to minimise the number of function nodes required 
   and protocol conversation of mobile data traffic. However, EPC 
   elements are bespoke stand-alone hardware (i.e., different boxes
   for different functions). Network operators have identified that 
   this approach costly and inflexible. 
   
   The ETSI Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) Industry Steering 
   Group (ISG) published a set of use cases [NFV-ISG-UC]. One key 
   use case described the Virtualisation of Mobile Core Network and IP 
   Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), known as the vEPC.

   The NFV approach takes the EPCs functional elements and runs them as 
   software instances (Virtual Appliances) on high-volume industry-
   standard generic servers. This approach has number of advantages 
   including:
   
   o Reducing: Cost, Power, Space and Complexity.
   
   o Increasing: Flexibility, Scalability and Consolidation.
   
   This use case document describes the vEPC architecture, functional 
   components and defines the resiliency requirements for the vEPC use 
   case. 

1.1 Operator Benefits of Virtualization
    
   There are a number of Operator Benefits which can be achieved 
   through virtualization of the EPC, these include:

   o Economies of scale through common virtualized platform
   o Enables a Multi-Service (MS) platform
   o Reducing time to market to offer new services
   
   o Uniformity of operations
   o Simplified high availability
   o Simplified disaster recovery
   o Preferred test and diagnostic tools embedded

   o Simplified in-service software upgrades
   o Reduced training
   o Simplified planning and provisioning
   o Automation of installation
   o Reduced site visits


2. Terminology

   Evolved Packet Core (EPC): is an evolution of the 3GPP GPRS system 


King et al.               Expires July, 2015                   [Page 3]
Internet Draft        Virtualisation of Mobile Network     January 2015


   characterized by a higher-data-rate, lower-latency, packet-
   optimized system. 
   
   Home Subscriber Server (HSS): a database that contains 
   user-related and subscriber-related information. It also provides 
   support functions in mobility management, call and session setup, 
   user authentication and access authorization.

   Mobility Management Entity (MME) provides the signaling related 
   to mobility and security for Evolved UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access
   Network (E-UTRAN) access.
   
   Packet Data Network Gateway (PDN GW): is the point of interconnect 
   between the EPC and the external IP networks.
   
   Policy and Charging Rules Function (PCRF): provides policy and 
   service control and the appropriate interfaces towards the mobile
   charging and billing systems.
   
   Serving GW (SGW): is the interconnect between the radio-side and the 
   EPC. The SGW serves the User Equipment (UE) by routing the incoming 
   and outgoing IP packets.
   
   Virtualized Network Function (VNF): a VNF provides the same 
   functional behavior and interfaces as the equivalent network 
   function, but is deployed as software instances building on top of a 
   virtualization layer.

   VNF Pool: a group of VNF instances providing the same network 
   function.

   VNF Pool Element: a VNF instance inside a VNF pool.

   VNF Pool Manager: an entity that manages a VNF pool, and interacts 
   with the service control entity to provide the network function.

   VNF Set: a group of VNF instances that can be used to build network 
   services.


3. Virtual Evolved Packet Core (vEPC)

   Deploying and operating mobile core network functions on 
   commodity hardware resources may provide significant network usage 
   efficiency and reductions in operational expenditure. Increased 
   automation would also accommodate scaling of voice and mobile data 
   demands. 
 
   The ETSI NFV use case [NFV-ISG-UC] describes requirements for 


King et al.               Expires July, 2015                   [Page 4]
Internet Draft        Virtualisation of Mobile Network     January 2015


   server and packet gateways used for Packet Data Network 
   (PDN) connections and IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) session (see 
   Figure 1: Virtualized mobile core network and IMS).  
   
   Typically mobile services are typically time dependent and may 
   require a large number of computing resources in proportion to the 
   number of users and/or service requests. Therefore it is 
   desirable to scale them according to their specific computing 
   requirements.  The virtualization can be applied to the Evolved 
   Packet Core (EPC) and the IMS to provide end to end
   service with service availability and resilience. 
     
3.1 Mobile Core Network Components 

   Within the mobile core network a number of nodes and 
   specific functions are currently provided by dedicated hardware 
   and software for mobile voice and data services, these are 
   described in more detail in the following sub-sections. 
 
3.1.1 Mobile Network Nodes 

   The EPC is comprised of a variety of nodes, these include: 
   
   o Mobility Management Entity (MME);
   
   o Serving Gateway (SGW);
   
   o Packet Data Network Gateway (PDN-GW);
   
   o Home Subscriber Server (HSS).
    
3.1.2 Mobile Network Functions

   The EPC provides a number of functions to manage mobile user traffic, 
   these include: 

   o Firewall (FW);
  
   o Policy Control (PC);
   
   o Network Address Translation (NAT);
   
   o Load Balancing (LB);
   
   o Deep Packet Inspection (DPI);
      
   o TCP Optimization of Traffic Flows;

   o HTTP Enrichment of Traffic Flows;

Internet Draft        Virtualisation of Mobile Network     January 2015


   o Video Stream Optimization;

   o Video Content Caching.
   
3.2 vEPC Resiliency Requirements 

   When those virtualized service nodes(e.g., virtualized S/P-GW and 
   IMS functions) are failed or overloaded, dynamic relocation of 
   VNFs can be performed, the relocation of the managed 
   sessions and/or connections must be accordingly managed.  It also 
   should be noted in [NFV-REL-REQ] that the traffic in the original 
   VSN must be routed to the new location and it is desirable that 
   the movement of the VSN is transparent to other VSN and or 
   physical network entities such as client application on the UE.  
   That is to say the other VSNs do not require to take any special 
   action to this movement.

   In this architecture, the following general resiliency requirements 
   need to be satisfied:

   o  Resource scaling - elastic service aware resource allocation to
      network functions;

   o  State maintenance - network and network function state management
      during VSN relocation, replication, and resource scaling;

   o  Monitoring/fault detection/diagnosis/recovery - appropriate

      mechanism for monitoring/fault detection/diagnosis/recovery of all
      components and their states after virtualization, e.g. VNF,
      hardware, hypervisor;

   o  Service Availability - achieving the same level of service
      availability for the end-to-end virtualized mobile core network as
      in non-virtualized networks with reduced cost;

   o  Minimum impact on other relevant functions.

3.2.1 Handling Unplanned Traffic Peaks

   Vendors are currently working with the Japanese Government to 
   demonstrate the capabilities that a vEPC can have in handling 
   unplanned traffic surges due to unforeseen circumstances: 
   
   o A recent earthquake in Japan caused the demand for calls to 
   increase to 150% capacity in the effected area. Calls were dropped 
   due to the network capacity.
   
   o At the time the capacity in other areas was only 50%. In a vEPC 
   environment the free resources from the other areas could have been 
   used to manage this additional load. 

3.2.2 Scaling of Resources and Functions

   The Evolved Packet System (EPS) is built from logical network 
   functions, e.g. MME, PDN Gateway, Serving Gateway and Radio Base 
   station (evolved NodeB) which are connected through the specified 
   architectures references points. The 3GPP standard considers load 
   balancing between different logical network functions of the same 
   type. For example, Radio Base stations can choose one out of 
   multiple available MMEs according to load-based weight factors to 
   register an attaching mobile device. Mobile network operators can 
   dimension their network in terms of numbers of required MMEs or 
   data gateways according to statistical figures and thorough 
   network planning, such as busy hour call attempts (BHCA).

   Virtualization technology enables adding additional resources as 
   logical network functions by means of instantiation of the relevant 
   functions in virtual machines. The instantiation of additional 
   virtualized PDN Gateways or MMEs requires the announcement of their 
   availability to other network components of the EPS. New attachments 
   can then be balanced and distributed between an increased number of 
   available network functions. Such procedure for scale-out suits the 
   adaptation of the EPS resources to an increasing demand with low time 
   constraints, e.g. due to an expected increase in subscribers or 
   traffic volume. 



King et al.               Expires July, 2015                   [Page 7]
Internet Draft        Virtualisation of Mobile Network     January 2015


   Unexpected increase in traffic or subscribers' attempt to request 
   mobile service can result from scheduled events, e.g. festivals, or 
   in particular after disaster events, such as an earthquake. The 
   latter case in particular requires the mobile network to handle 
   service requests and traffic from a huge amount of active mobile 
   subscribers.
    
   Communication services during disaster events are essential, not only 
   to provide a communication platform for rescue workers, but also to 
   allow private subscribers to communicate with relatives.

   Such unexpected increase in active subscribers and traffic volume 
   should not result in dropped connections, e.g. forced disconnects to 
   offload existing subscriber states and traffic volume. It is 
   preferable to scale-out resources internal to a single logical 
   network function, e.g. an MME or a PDN Gateway. The advantage of 
   such network function-internal resources scaling is the in-dependency 
   of and transparency to external network functions and EPC protocols.

   Functionality and resources for a particular Virtualized Network 
   Function (VNF) may be provisioned by the interplay of multiple 
   virtualized Network Function Components (VNFC), whose instances 
   map 1:1, or m:1, to virtual machines. Scaling up internally of a 
   single instance of a VNF may be accomplished by the instantiation 
   of additional VNFC instances. Load on the VNF must then be 
   balanced between the multiple VNFC instances (LB). Such scaling 
   must remain transparent to external network entities and to other 
   VNFs.

   Technology for VNF scaling must also provide means to scale-in and 
   reduce the number of resources in terms of required VNFCs, which 
   provide the required network function.

   Technology for VNF scaling must also provide means to scale-in and 
   reduce the number of resources in terms of required VNFs, which 
   provide the required network function.

   Some general requirements for scaling in the view of virtualized EPC 
   network functions:

   o Transparency and compatibility of network functions virtualization 
   to legacy EPS components; 
   
   o Support for scale-out of VNFs, representing additional logical 
   EPC network functions;
   
   o Inter-working with configuration management (OSS) to configure and 
   announce new Network Functions to the EPS;

   o Automation of scaling and simplified OAM;
   
   o VNF-internal scale-out and resiliency management;
 
   o Support of scale-in and associated shut down of VNFC instances; 
   handling of states associated with VNFCs, which are to be shut
   down (state depletion vs. state transfer/offload);

   o (non-critical: VM aggregation to fewer host servers, e.g. to enable 
   host server power saving).

   Service requirements for the scaling of VNFs from VNFPool 
   perspective, based on the current working group scope of 
   work:
   
   o Balancing load between VNFs within a VNFPool;
   
   o Inter-working with system-wide (e.g. EPS) load balancing, e.g.
     cellular-specific selection of VNFs;
     
   o Compatibility with system-wide addressing of selected VNFs. 
     VNFPool solutions may consider different addressing schemes 
     and associated address mapping within and outside a VNFPool;
   
   o Coordination of scale-out and scale-in of VNFs within a VNFPool;
    
   o Coordination of the use, visibility and addressability of 
     additional VNF resources. New VNFs, which carry a new system-wide 
     identifier, need to be announced to the system. New VNFs, which 
     carry only a new VNFPool-internal identifier and provide additional 
     VNF resources for an existing instance of a network function 
     (system is aware of the network function instance's     
     identifier) require only VNFPool-internal coordination.

3.2.3 Failure Handling

   During vEPC deployment, various failures can occur, for instance 
   virtual machine failure, hypervisor failure, a broken host server, 
   failure in a datacenter's transport network infrastructure, as well 
   as failure of network links which connect a datacenter to the global 
   network infrastructure.

   It is unlikely that a single solution suits the handling of all kind 
   of failures. Typically for today's products, function redundancy and 
   state synchronization as well as failure detection and failover are 
   function and implementation specific. 

   The detection of VM or hardware failures on a host server, as well as 
   failure of networking equipment may introduce some delay before the 
   system initiates failover to standby or backup resources. It may not 
   be possible for an operator to meet agreed service levels in all 
   cases.
    
   Due to the variety of different failure reasons, detection of the 
   failure type may be required to initiate the appropriate procedure 
   for failover handling. Mobile operators have strong requirements to 
   minimize the time of system outage as experiences by subscribers, 
   hence require minimal detection and failover handling latencies.

   Referring to the architecture of a virtualized Network Function as 
   depicted in Figure 2, some VNFCs may require synchronization of 
   states with a standby VNFC instance of the same kind to introduce 
   redundancy on VNFC level. Others may not require state 
   synchronization but rely simply a backup VNFC with the same   
   functionality, as in case of failure, states can be recovered and 
   retrieved from a different VNF, which holds the same or a sub-set of 
   these states. Hence, redundancy management and failover mechanisms 
   can be VNFC-specific.

   Disaster events, such as an earthquake, can have impact to the 
   availability of a larger VNF Set (a group of VNFs providing different 
   functions) or even to the access to a complete data center in case 
   the data center's links to the global network infrastructure

   breaks. In such case, even the availability of a backup system in 
   a globally and topologically distant data center can meet the 
   requirement of service continuation. Seamless continuation of 
   subscribers' services is unlikely, as it would require maintenance 
   of state synchronization between functions being instantiated in 
   different data centers. But solely the provisioning of backup vNFs 
   allows subscribers to re-attach to the mobile communication system 
   and place new calls. Handling such failover requires macroscopic 
   indirection of the EPC reference points to a set of backup VNFs in 
   a different data center.
   
   Some general requirements for failure detection and failover handling 
   in the view of virtualized EPC network functions:
   
   o Support function-specific redundancy and failover management;

   o Support different kinds of redundancy for failover (state 
   synchronization between VNF instances, state recovery at backup VNF 
   instances, state re-establishment at a backup VNF instance);
   
   o Selection of appropriate commodity hardware for backup and failover 
   (resources availability);

   o Minimize state synchronization- and failover latency;
   
   o Detection of failure;
   
   o Detection of failure type and level (e.g. VNF, hypervisor, 
   hardware, network);
   
   o Enforcement of failover strategy according to failure type;
   
   o Automated detection and failure handling.

   Service requirements for failure handling from VNFPool perspective, 
   based on the current working group scope of work:

   o Selection of suitable resources (host server, rack, topological 
     location) for redundant VNFs;
   
   o Instantiation and installation of redundant resources on VNF-level;
   
   o Policing and enforcement of different redundancy schemes (e.g. 
     active/standby synchronization, backup VNF);
   
   o Inter-working between VNF-internal (active/standby VNFC) and 
     external (VNF redundancy) redundancy management;
   
   o Failover between VNFs within a VNFPool;

3.2.4 State Synchronization

   vEPC components may be split into control (signaling) and forwarding 
   (data) plane traffic. A failure of a control plane traffic may result 
   in the loss of communication between EPC functions. This should not 
   impact user forwarding traffic, and it may be necessary for control 
   functions to have state maintained and synchronized with back-up 
   VNF instances hosting control elements. 
   
   Also it may be necessary for data plane state to also be 
   synchronized so certain connections continue to be operational
   and capable of forwarding traffic during from one VNF to 
   another.  

3.3 What does that mean for Virtual Network Function Pool (VNF Pool)?

   For VNF Pool in the view of EPC, it is to be investigated where an 
   IETF-based generalized functional architecture and common protocol 
   can support vEPC scaling, failure detection and handling. Such 
   common protocol components should allow inter-working with VNF-
   specific and possibly proprietary but highly efficient mechanisms 
   for redundancy and fault management.

   The granularity of a VNF Pool Manager[zong-vnfpool-problem-
   statement] may be a VNF, VNF Pool or VNF Set. It is assumed that a 
   Pool Manager handles VNFs with the granularity of EPC network 
   functions (MME, PDN Gateway).

   A VNF Pool Manager's role for load balancing between PEs is to be 
   investigated, taking additional and independent load balancing 
   instances for macroscopic (system-wide) load balancing within the EPS 
   and for microscopic load balancing (between multiple VNFs of a 
   single logical VNF instance) into account.

3.3.1 VNF Pool Definitions

   There is a hierarchy of terms used to describe VNF Pool components 
   and their relationship:
   
   o An instantiation of a VNF is known as a VNF instance;
   
   o A group of VNF instances is known as a VNF Set; 
   
   o A managed VNF Set is known as a VNF Pool;
   
   o A VNF pool is managed using a VNF Pool Manager.  

   These definitions will be moved into the terminology section if they
   are agreed by the working group.
