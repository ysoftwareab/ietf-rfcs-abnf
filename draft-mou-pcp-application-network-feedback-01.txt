   PCP Extension for Signaling Feedback Information from the End-User
        Application to the Application Sever and to the Network
             draft-mou-pcp-application-network-feedback-01

Abstract

   Nowadays users consumption style for video and multimedia
   applications is strongly changing.  Users are consuming content
   through multi-screen and are heavily counting on wireless and mobile
   devices for video streaming and interactive video and multimedia
   applications.  This necessitates more intelligence in the service and
   the network infrastructure to better suit a differentiated users
   consumption style, which can be achieved through having: (i) a
   knowledge in the network and service platform about the available
   device and network conditions for the end-user and (ii) a knowledge
   in the network about the content requirements in terms of devices
   capabilities and network resources for content stored either in the
   network or in the application server.  To obtain such knowledge with
   no need for changing the current infrastructure and in a generalized
   way to all applications, feedback/notification mechanisms between the
   end-user application, the network and the service platform is needed
   to provide information helping the content delivery and adaptation
   decisions.  This document is investigating such application-agnostic
   track.

   This document extends the Port Control Protocol (PCP) RFC 6887
   [RFC6887] to allow: (i) the users application to notify the network
   and application server about its available resources in terms of
   devices capabilities and network conditions as well as information
   about the user (e.g., location, mobility status) and (ii) the
   application server to notify the network about the requirements of
   the content it stores in terms of devices and network resources.  A
   new PCP option, denoted the FEEDBACK, is specified to allow such
   feedback notification signaling.  This option is used with both PEER
   and MAP Opcodes.

1.  Introduction

   Nowadays, Internet traffic includes huge amount of video traffic
   which is expected to highly dominate the Internet traffic in the
   coming years.  The users consumption style for video services is
   strongly evolving towards a user-centric model enabling video
   services access based on users profiles and making receiving device
   (e.g., Laptops, tablets, smartphones, and future devices models)
   constitute the majority of end-user devices for video services
   through plenty of services over the Internet.

   Although this big evolution, the network and service infrastructure
   are not optimized enough to handle the content delivery and
   adaptation function of the network resources, devices resources,
   application and content requirements.  As a result, Quality of
   Experience (QoE) for video services and multimedia applications can
   not be guaranteed in some situations.

   This document defines an extension to the Port Control Protocol (PCP)
   RFC 6887 [RFC6887] allowing: (i) the end-user application to signal
   in real-time to the network and application server information about
   its available device capabilities and network connectivities (e.g.,
   support to different content bitrates, buffering status as an
   indication of the network connectivity level) as well as other useful
   context information (e.g., location, mobility status) and (ii) the
   application server to signal in real-time to the network the
   requirement of the content it stores in terms of devices and network
   resources.  The extension defines a new PCP option for the existing
   PEER and MAP OpCodes: FEEDBACK Option for signaling information
   between the end-users application, the network and the application
   server.

   Motivations to undertake this effort are discussed in Section 3
   through a number of use cases, while justifications for the use of
   PCP are elaborated in Section 4.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Use Cases

   The new model for video services consumption over mobile and wireless
   networks creates the need for feedback information between the end-
   user application, the network and the service platform in real-time.
   This helps optimizing the content for device/network resources on one
   hand and end-user QoE and battery experience on the other hand.  In
   this view more intelligence needs to be considered in the network.  A
   way to do that is through having several service functions in the
   network middle boxes on the path between the end-user and the
   application server, as shown in Draft [ServiceFunctions], that could
   be collocated with the NAT function or not.  Examples of service
   functions that we consider to better manage the video delivery are:
   video optimization function (including transcoding), caching
   capabilities, TCP optimizer, video controller allowing for example
   content recommendation or intelligent scheduling in the case of
   cellular networks.  The following subsections present a use-case on
   video delivery optimization using PCP signaling to provide feedback
   information between the end-user application, the network and the
   service platform:

3.1.  Real-time Transcoding for Video Delivery Optimization

   In this use-case, the end-users device is the host implementing the
   PCP client and a middle box network node in the network (e.g. edge
   router, home gateway or any cache node close to the user) is the PCP
   server.  This middle box node can store a copy of the content or can
   be just a content relay from the application server to the end-user.

   o  If the middle box network node is only a relay, then it receives
      the feedback information sent to the network by the end-user
      application and by the application server and makes use of this
      information for optimizing the content it relays to the end-user
      through real-time transcoding.  This allows the server to send one
      version of content to the network node and this latter does real
      time transcoding to several clients with different capabilities
      connected to the edge router.  The middle box network node can be
      an edge router or home gateway supporting real-time transcoding
      function.

   o  If the middle box network node stores a copy of the content, then
      it makes use of the feedback information sent to the network by
      the end-user application to optimize the stored content when
      requested by the end-user before its delivery.  This allows
      optimizing the storage space through storing few presentations of
      content and providing the necessary presentation on-demand through
      real-time transcoding.  The middle box network node can be a

Internet-DrPCP Extension for Signaling Feedback Information f   May 2014


      network cache node, edge router or home gateway caching the
      content and supporting real-time transcoding function.

3.2.  Optimization Examples

   The following are some examples on how to optimize the content for
   device and network resources on one hand and end-user QoE and battery
   experience on the other hand.

   o  For a high display resolution, a video of high bitrate/resolution
      is sent if the users application buffering level and the global
      network bandwidth conditions are sufficient and the battery level
      is sufficient.
   o  If the battery level degrades during the session even if the users
      application buffering level remains sufficient, then the video is
      continued to be streamed in lesser bitrate/resolution to save
      battery and prevent video session interruption due to battery
      failure (keeping a threshold on the quality based on the remaining
      resources).  In this case, lesser resources can be allocated for
      cellular users to match the bandwidth required for the low bitrate
      video.
   o  If the battery level is fine but the users application buffering
      level and global network bandwidth conditions degrades, the video
      switches to lower bitrate (following the ordinary adaptive
      streaming approach), which in turns save in the battery level.
   o  For small size display, the transmission errors are less observed
      by the user especially if the user is mobile and is in a noisy
      environment and so video can be displayed with lesser quality
      (bitrate) to save battery resources and network resources even if
      the buffering level and global network bandwidth conditions are
      not poor.  This is much useful for content categories as news and
      non-live content, in which transmission errors have lesser impact
      on the users perception.

4.  Why PCP?

   The use of PCP to signal feedback/notification between the end-users
   application, the network and service platform in real-time is
   motivated by the following: In the Port Control Protocol (PCP)
   specification RFC 6887 [RFC6887], PCP is viewed as a request/response
   protocol and also as a hint/notification protocol between a PCP
   client and a PCP server.  Message flows in PCP are viewed as
   independent streams carrying information between the PCP client and
   the PCP server, in which the PCP client sends a stream of hints
   indicating to its server its mapping status and the PCP server sends
   to the client a notification informing the client on the actual state
   of its mapping.  In this view of the protocol, PCP can be extended to
   carry more mapping information than the IP internal versus external

   addresses.  Draft [Flowdata] is an example of the use of PCP for
   signaling by the client the flow characteristics to the network and
   signaling by the network its ability to accommodate that flow back to
   the client.

   In addition, PCP allows learning and influencing the mapping
   lifetime, which helps reducing network bandwidth, overload on
   application servers and middle boxes and battery resources for
   wireless and mobile devices.  This makes PCP suitable for conveying
   feedback information in our use-cases in real-time and resource wise
   way.

   Further advantages for PCP motivating its use are as follows:

   o  PCP can be used to install state in upstream devices such as NAT,
      firewalls or other flow-aware devices.
   o  PCP can be used to notify a failure that may occur at an upstream
      PCP-controlled device, and therefore the PCP client can react
      accordingly.
   o  PCP allows learning the lifetime of installed mappings and would
      therefore avoid overloading the network and service platform with
      keepalive messages.  This also saves the battery resources for
      wireless and mobile end-user devices.
   o  PCP can be used to notify the network with the flow
      characteristics so as to enforce policies at the access segment.
   o  PCP can be used to receive informative information from the
      network so that client may use them to select the interface to use
      to place a session.
   o  PCP can be extended easily to allow reporting capabilities to a
      remote server.
   o  Extending PCP with the FEEDBACK feature avoids making assumptions
      on how media streams are exchanged (e.g., RTP, IAX mini-frames,
      etc.).
   o  PCP extension does not require an OS support.  The feature can be
      managed at the application level.

5.  FEEDBACK PCP Option

   This document presents an extension to PCP through the definition of
   FEEDBACK option in PCP.  The FEEDBACK option aims to signal feedback
   information between the end-user application, the network and service
   platform to help optimizing the network and devices resources and
   enhancing the users experience.  This feedback mechanism makes also
   use of the PCP FLOWDATA option [Flowdata].  This means that the PCP
   client sends both FLOWDATA and the FEEDBACK options in the same
   requests.

Internet-DrPCP Extension for Signaling Feedback Information f   May 2014


   The information signaled in the FEEDBACK Option may include the
   screen size, screen resolution and battery level as device
   capabilities information and the users location, environment type and
   mobility status as context information on the user side.  This
   information is signaled once at the beginning of the session and can
   be updated upon variation.  Following the information signaling, the
   PCP server uses the FEEDBACK option to signal its ability of
   providing content with characteristics matching the device and
   network resources as well as the user context.  This information will
   be used by the application server and by the network (through the
   middle box network nodes having service functions) for optimized
   content adaptation as explained in Section 3.

   The FEEDBACK option does not make any assumption on the presence of
   NAT and/or firewall.  In particular, PCP-based mechanism to
   instantiate state in an upstream NAT, firewall and any other flow-
   aware device are not impacted by the use of FEEDBACK option.

   The PCP client is implemented at the end-user device and the
   application server (content server), and the PCP server is
   implemented at the middle box network node storing the content and
   the application server.  The PCP client may be configured with
   multiple IP addresses; each of them pointing to a distinct PCP
   server.  The PCP client will contact all these PCP server in parallel
   as discussed in [I-D.ietf-pcp-server-selection].

   A PCP Proxy [PCPProxy] functionality can be enabled in intermediate
   nodes (e.g., Customer Premise Equipment (CPE)) on the path between
   the PCP client and the PCP server.

   Upon receipt of the FEEDBACK option by the PCP Server, its content is
   passed to the Application Server that decides whether an action is
   needed to serve the requesting client to better accommodate its
   resources and conditions.

   The procedure for generating a request that includes the FEEDBACK
   option, handling a request that includes the FEEDBACK option, and
   generating a response to a request that includes the FEEDBACK option
   is similar to the behavior specified in [Flowdata].

   Triggers to generate a request that capture the network conditions
   and device recourses in a FLOWDATA and FEEDBACK options are local to
   the application.  How the application server or network middle boxes
   makes use of the content of the FLOWDATA and FEEDBACK options is also
   local to the PCP Server and to each the decision-making process at
   the Application Server side or network middle box node.

      location, environment light/noise, mobility status), and
      information on the content that can be provided by the application
      server.

   client authentication [PCPAuthentication] are sufficient to ensure
   security and host authorization for the proposed PCP extension in
   this document.

7.  IANA Consideration

   IANA is requested to assign a new PCP option called FEEDBACK in the
   IANA registry for PCP [pcp-iana].

Appendix A.  Existing Protocols of Relevance to User's Feedback
             Information and their Limitations

   Some existing protocols can convey devices characteristics and
   information on the user, however with limited applicability.
   Examples are:

   o  SIP [RFC3840]

      *  Provides a specification for capabilities and characteristics
         in SIP User Agent (UA).  Capabilities and characteristics
         information is carried as parameters of the Contact header
         field and can be used within REGISTER requests and responses,
         OPTIONS responses, and requests and responses creating dialogs
         (such as INVITE).

      *  SIP limitation for the explained use-cases: i) the need of
         adding the SIP protocol stack in video streaming servers, ii)
         SIP does not rely on network entities and is mainly an
         application specific protocol, and iii) SIP is not appropriate
         for "live" real-time control with no network priority to SIP
         controls.

      *  Other Signalling protocols such as IAX are used to establish
         media sessions.

   o  HTTP 1.1 [RFC2616] and HTTP2.0 [I-D.ietf-httpbis-http2]

      *  HTTP can incorporate information on the device and the user in
         its headers (e.g. Accept or Use-Agent headers), however this
         will not be a generic solution to any underlying transport
         protocol.

      *  Also, HTTP by its nature is a stateless protocol and activating
         HTTP proxy functionality impacts the performance of the network
         which limits the communication through proxies.

   o  SDP [RFC4566]

      *  SDP is meant to provide a standard representation for session
         description without incorporating a transport protocol, without
         a focus on user's feedback information

      *  SDP is used for the session negotiation at the beginning of the
         session and so for the devices characteristics and the user
         information could not be directly signaled in real-time

      *  SDP uses protocols as SIP and RTSP that are not intercepted by
         middle nodes in the network which limits its applicability.

      *  SDP is not used in some non-SIP deployement contexts.
