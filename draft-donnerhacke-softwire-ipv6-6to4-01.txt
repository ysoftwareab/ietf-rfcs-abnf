Abstract

   This document extends the stability of 6to4 and Teredo routing by
   defining the global anycast routes 2002::/16 and 2001::/32 as a
   routes of last resort. More specific unicast routes are allowed in
   order to create a more stable environment.

1. Introduction

   6to4 [RFC3056] and Teredo [RFC4380] define successful technologies to
   connect IPv6 networks over legacy only backbones. By allowing large
   ISPs to announce a more specific of the default anycast routes, the
   operational domain of transition technologies is extended from the
   service provider network under its direct control to the global net-
   work. From the perspective of customer sites and the global IPv6
   Internet the IPv6 service provided by the service provider is equiva-
   lent to native IPv6.

2. Allowing more specific unicast routes

   The main purpose of this document is to legitimate announcements of
   more specific unicast routes into the global Internet. This document
   does only deals with the transition technologies of 6to4 and Teredo.
   It it not applicable to other anycasted services.

2.1. Allowing more specific unicast routes for 6to4

   The relevant part of section 5.2 of RFC3056

      6to4 prefixes more specific than 2002::/16 must not be propagated
      in native IPv6 routing, to prevent pollution of the IPv6 routing
      table by elements of the IPv4 routing table. Therefore, a 6to4
      site which also has a native IPv6 connection MUST NOT advertise
      its 2002::/48 routing prefix on that connection, and all native
      IPv6 network operators MUST filter out and discard any 2002::
      routing prefix advertisements longer than /16.

   is changed to

      6to4 prefixes more specific than 2002::/16 are allowed to be

      propagated in native IPv6 routing, as long as the more specific
      matchs exactly the mapped most aggregated IPv4 route originated by
      the same AS. In order to prevent misuse, the route objects in the
      routing databases for such more specifics can only be created by
      the RIR which allocated the corresponding IPv4 prefix.

   So if an ISP announces a IPv4 prefix aa.bb.cc.0/20, it is now allowed
   to announce the 6to4 prefix 2002:aabb:cc00::/36, too, if it deploys
   6to4 to it's customers.

2.2. Allowing more specific unicast routes for Teredo

   RFC4380 does not specify how the IPv6 Teredo prefix is to be
   announced by the Teredo relays. It does only state, that normal rout-
   ing technology should be used:

      Teredo relays are IPv6 routers that advertise reachability of the
      Teredo service IPv6 prefix through the IPv6 routing protocols.

   So if an ISP announces a IPv4 prefix aa.bb.cc.0/20, it is now allowed
   to announce the Teredo prefix 2000:0:aabb:cc00::/52, too, if it
   deploys Teredo to it's customers.

3. Rationale

   Several 6to4 routers and Teredo relays out there are broken and
   nobody cares about fixing them. There is not enough deployment to fix
   those problems by reporting errors.

   In order to provide stable routing over their IPv4-only backbones
   ISPs prefers to keep the 6to4 and Teredo traffic as long as possible
   in the IPv6 network. One proposal ist 6rd [I-D.ietf-softwire-
   ipv6-6rd] with allows every ISP to assign it's own unicast prefix
   similar to 2002::/16. This is a huge waste of address space.

   Announcing more specifics of an anycast default route allows opera-
   tors to drop routing announcements without disrupting the service.
   This way the impact to the local routing tables can be minimized, if
   necessary. If an autonomous system chooses to drop some or all more
   specifics, it can still reach the systems by routing to the anycast
   default. Because a filtering autonomous systems does not reannounce
   the filtered prefixes to peers, there is no chance to create routing
   loops: The more specific routing will ignore the filtering autonomous
   systems at all. Disconnected routing partitions for the more specific
   prefixes will still work, because the announcing 6to4 router or
   Teredo relay is always reachable within the partition it spans.

4. Security Considerations

   Announcing more specifics of anycast addresses drastically changes
   the routing system. In order to obtain the same result for the any-
   cast and the unicast routing, the originating AS for the more spe-
   cific unicast 6to4 route MUST match the originating AS for the corre-
   sponding, valid IPv4 route.

   In order to ease filtering at BGP level, route objects SHOULD NOT be
   created and maintained by any LIR itself. The RIR allocating the IPv4
   address space MUST create an corresponding route object for unicast
   6to4 routes on request. More specifics than route for the correspond-
   ing IPv4 allocate SHOULD NOT be created.

5. IANA Considerations

   No assignments by the IANA are required.

7. Changes history

   This section will not appear in the final document. It does provide
   some convenience hints what changed between the document version. It
   is not complete nor normative.

   Important differences from 00 to 01:
   - More specifics for Teredo
      - Consequences of filtering more specifics in autonomous systems

8. Acknowledgements

   This proposal was influences by the valuable input of several people
   from the DENOG group. They convined me to keep this proposal up to
   date and raised several important questions about the impact to the
   global routing.
