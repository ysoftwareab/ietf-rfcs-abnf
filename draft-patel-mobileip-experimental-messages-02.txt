   Abstract 
         
         
        Mobile IPv4 message types range from 0 to 255. This document 
        reserves a message type for use by an individual, company, or 
        organization for experimental purpose, to evaluate enhancements 
        to Mobile IPv4 messages before formal standards proposal. 
         
        Mobile IPv4 defines a general Extension mechanism to allow 
        optional  information  to  be  carried  by  Mobile  IP  control 
        messages. Extensions are not skippable, if defined in range [0-
        127]  and  skippable,  if  defined  in  range  [128-255].  This 
        document reserves extension types in both the skippable and 
        non-skippable range for experimental use.  
         
        Also, Mobile IPv4 defines error codes for use by FA [64-127] 
        and HA [128-192]. This document reserves an error code in both 
        these ranges for experimental use.

   1. Introduction  
 
 
        Mobile IPv4 message types range from 0 to 255. This document 
        reserves a message type for experimental purpose, to evaluate 
        enhancements to Mobile IPv4 messages before formal standards 
        proposal. 
         
        Without experimental message capability, one would have to 
        select a type value from the range defined for IANA assignment, 
        which may result in collision. 
         
        Also, Mobile IP defines a general Extension mechanism to allow 
        optional  information  to  be  carried  by  Mobile  IP  control 
        messages. Extensions are not skippable, if defined in range [0-
        127]  and  skippable,  if  defined  in  range  [128-255].  This 
        document reserves extension types in both the skippable and 
        non-skippable range for experimental use.  
         
        Mobile IPv4 defines error codes for use by FA [64-127] and HA 
        [128-192]. This document reserves an error code in both these 
        ranges for experimental use.

   2. Terminology 
         
        The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL 
        NOT",  "SHOULD",  "SHOULD  NOT",  "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY",  and 
        "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described 
        in [1].  
           
        EXP-MSG-TYPE: A message in the range [0-255] to be assigned by 
        IANA for experimental use. 
         
        EXP-SKIP-EXT-TYPE:  Extension  in  the  range  [128-255]  to  be 
        assigned by IANA for experimental use. 
         
        EXP-NONSKIP-EXT-TYPE: Extension in the range [0-127] to be 
        assigned by IANA for experimental use. 
         
        EXP-HA-ERROR-CODE: Error code in the range [128-192] for use by 
        HA in reply messages to indicate error condition. 
         
        EXP-FA-ERROR-CODE: Error code in the range [64-127] for use by 
        FA in reply messages to indicate error condition. 
 
         
   3. Experimental Message 
         
 
        Since the nature and purpose of an experimental message cannot 
        be  known in advance, the structure is defined as opaque 
        payload. Entities implementing the message can interpret the 
        message as per their implementation. One suggestion is to 
        interpret based on extensions present in the message. 
       
        These messages will be used between the mobility entities (Home 
        Agent, Foreign Agent, and Mobile Node). Experimental messages 
        SHOULD  be  authenticated  using  any  of  the  authentication 
        mechanism defined for Mobile IP ([2], [5]).  
         
        This message MAY contain extensions defined in Mobile IP, 
        including vendor specific extensions [4]. 
       
       
        IP fields: 
           Source Address Typically the interface address from which 
           the message is sent. 
       
           Destination Address The address of the agent or the Mobile    
           Node. 
       
        UDP fields: 
       
            Source Port variable

            Destination Port 434 
       
        Mobile IP fields shown below follow the UDP header: 
 
      0                   1                   2                   3

        Type       EXP-MSG-TYPE (To be assigned by IANA) 
         
        Opaque     The Opaque is zero or more octets. 
         
         
        Once an experimental message has been tested and shown to be 
        useful, a permanent number could be obtained through the normal 
        assignment procedures. 
         
        A single experimental message type is recommended since this 
        message can contain extensions based on which the message can 
        be interpreted.  
         
         
   4. Experimental Extensions 
         
         
        This document reserves extensions in both skippable and non-
        skippable range for experimental purposes. The long extension 
        format  (for  non-skippable  extensions)  and  short  extension 
        format (for skippable extensions), as defined [2] are used for 
        experimental extensions. 
         
         
   4.1 Non-skippable Experimental Extension 
         
        This format is applicable for non-skippable extensions, which 
        carry information more than 256 bytes.

   Internet Draft   Experimental Message, Extension & Error Codes   October 2003 
               
 
        Type     EXP-NONSKIP-EXT-TYPE (to be assigned by IANA) is   
                 the type, which describes an experimental extension. 
         
        Sub-Type is a unique number given to each member in the  
                 aggregated type. 
         
        Length   indicates the length (in bytes) of the data field  
                 within this Extension.  It does NOT include the Type,  
                 Sub-Type and Length bytes. 
         
        Opaque   The Opaque is zero or more octets. 
         
        Since the length field is 16 bits wide, the extension data can 
        exceed 256 bytes in length. 
         
         
         
   4.2 Skippable Experimental Extension 
    
         
        This format is applicable for skippable extensions, which carry 
        information less than 256 bytes. 
 
 
      0                   1                   2                   3

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
       
         
         
        Type     EXP-SKIP-EXT-TYPE (to be assigned by IANA) is the  
                 type, which describes an experimental extension. 
         
        Length   indicates the length (in bytes) of the data field  
                 within this Extension.  It does NOT include the Type  
                 and Length bytes. 
         
        Sub-Type is a unique number given to each member in the  
                 aggregated type. 
         
        Opaque   The Opaque is zero or more octets. 
         
         
        Since the length field is 8 bits wide, the extension data 
        cannot exceed 256 bytes in length.

   Internet Draft   Experimental Message, Extension & Error Codes   October 2003 
               
 
   5. Experimental Error Codes 
         
        This document reserves reply error code EXP-FA-ERROR-CODE, in 
        the range [64-127], for use by FA. This document also reserves 
        reply error code EXP-HA-ERROR-CODE, in the range [128-192], for 
        use by HA.  
         
        These experimental error codes may be included in registration 
        reply messages.  
         
        It is recommended that experimental error code must be included 
        in experimental messages or messages containing at-least one 
        experimental extension. 
    
 
   6. Mobility Entity Considerations 
    
        Mobility entities can send and receive experimental messages. 
        Implementations that don't understand the message type SHOULD 
        silently discard the message. 
         
        Experimental extensions can be carried in experimental messages 
        and standards defined messages. In the later case, it is 
        suggested that experimental extensions MUST not be used in 
        deployed products and usage be restricted to experimentations 
        only. 
    
    
   7. IANA Considerations 
    
        IANA services are required for this draft. Since a new message 
        type is needed to be reserved as experimental, a value must be 
        assigned for EXP-MSG-TYPE from Mobile IP control message space. 
         
        Also, values for EXP-NONSKIP-EXT-TYPE and EXP-SKIP-EXT-TYPE 
        must be assigned for experimental extensions. 
         
        Also, values for EXP-HA-ERROR-CODE and EXP-FA-ERROR-CODE must 
        be assigned for experimental error code. 
         
         
   8. Security Considerations 
         
        Like all Mobile IP control messages, the experimental messages  
        SHOULD  be  authenticated  with  at  least  one  authenticator. 
        Messages without a valid authenticator SHOULD be discarded. 
         
         
   9. Backward Compatibility Considerations  
    
        Mobility  entities  that  donÆt  understand  the  experimental 
        message MUST silently discard it.

   Internet Draft   Experimental Message, Extension & Error Codes   October 2003 
               
 
         
        Mobility  entities  that  donÆt  understand  the  experimental 
        skippable extensions MUST ignore them. Mobility entities that 
        donÆt understand the non-skippable experimental extensions MUST 
        silently discard the message containing them. 
         
        FA and HA SHOULD include experimental error code in reply 
        message  only if they have a general indication that the 
        receiving entity would be able to parse it. An indication of 
        this is if the request message was of type EXP-MSG-TYPE or 
        contained at-least one experimental extension.

        The IETF takes no position regarding the validity or scope of 
        any intellectual property or other rights that might be claimed
