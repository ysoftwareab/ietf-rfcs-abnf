1.  Introduction

   Networks utilise various management techniques to ensure efficient
   throughput, congestion management, anti-SPAM and security measures.
   Historically these functions have utilised visibility of the Internet
   application layer.

   This visibility is rapidly diminishing - encrypted Internet traffic
   is expected to continue its upward trend, driven by increased privacy
   awareness, uptake by popular services, and advocacy from the [IAB],
   [RFC7258] and W3C [TAG] .

   [IAB], [RFC7258] and [mm-effect-encrypt] recognise that network
   management functions are impacted by encryption, and that solutions
   are needed to persist them - as long as they do not threaten privacy.
   These solutions would ensure the benefits of encryption do not
   degrade network efficiency.

   This document lists such solutions, and points to evolving IETF work
   addressing the problem.

1.1.  Document structure

   This document describes the network management functions that are
   likely to be hindered by traffic encryption.

   It then describes the technical details of existing options to fully
   or partially persist these functions under encryption.  'Encryption'
   in this document typically refers to HTTP over TLS [RFC2818]; other
   forms of encryption are noted where applicable.

   Finally, a summary is provided of ongoing IETF work which is
   investigating how middleboxes along the network path can improve
   encrypted traffic delivery - again without breaching user privacy or
   security.

   The legal, political and commercial aspects of network management are
   recgnised but not covered in this technical document.

1.2.  Security protocols

   The following IETF protocols are considered in this document: TLS
   [RFC5246] , IPsec [RFC4301] and the ongoing transport layer security
   work of [TCPINC].

2.  Network management functions

   Editor's note: Part or all of this section may be removed where there
   is duplication with any updated version of [mm-effect-encrypt]

2.1.  Queuing

   Traffic flowing through a network may be queued for delivery.  This
   is important at an access network where network conditions can change
   rapidly - such as a cellular radio access network.  To account for
   congestion, the network will categorise content requests according to
   the latency and bandwidth required to deliver that content type.
   These combinations run from high-latency, low bandwidth (Email),
   medium latency, medium bandwidth (Web pages), low latency high
   bandwidth (video streaming), and many others including voice calls,
   texts, WebRTC and VoIP.  A well-managed network will triage between
   these content types and deliver from each queue in bursts, to ensure
   no user experiences a disrupted service.

2.2.  Intrusion detection

   Networks will monitor traffic stream behaviours to identify likely
   Denial of Service attacks.  Tools exist at each network layer to
   detect and mitigate these, including application layer detection.

2.3.  Policy enforcement

   Approved access to a network is a prerequisite to requests for
   Internet traffic - hence network access, including any authentication
   and authorisation, is not impacted by traffic encryption.

   Cellular networks often sell tariffs that allow free-data access to
   certain sites, known as 'zero rating'.  A session to visit such a
   site incurs no additional cost or data usage to the user.  Such 'zero
   rating

   Note: this section deliberately does not go into detail on the
   ramifications of encryption as regards government regulation.  These
   regulations include 'Lawful Intercept', adherence to Codes of
   Practice on content filtering, application of court order filters.
   However it is clear that these functions are impacted by encryption,
   typically by allowing a less granular means of implementation.  The
   enforcement of any Net Neutrality regulations is unlikely to be
   affected by content being encrypted.

2.4.  SPAM and malware filtering

   This has typically required Deep Packet Inspection to filter various
   keywords, fraudulent headers and virus attachments.

3.  Flow information visible to a network

3.1.  IP 5-tuple

   This indicates source and destination IP addresses/ports and the
   transport protocol.  This information is available during TLS, TCP-
   layer encryption (except ports), and IP-layer encryption (IPSec);
   although it may be obscured in Tunnel mode IPSec.

   This allows network management at a coarse IP-source level, which
   makes it of limited value where the origin server supports a blend of
   service types.

   Obscured from network by: IPSec Tunnel Mode

3.2.  TLS Server Name Indication

   When initiating the TLS handshake, the Client may provide an
   extension field (server_name) which indicates the server to which it
   is attempting a secure connection.  TLS SNI was standardized in 2003
   to enable servers to present the "correct TLS certificate" to clients
   in a deployment of multiple virtual servers hosted by the same server
   infrastructure and IP-address.  Although this is an optional
   extension, it is today supported by all modern browsers, web servers
   and developer libraries.  Notable exceptions are Android 2.2 and
   Internet Explorer 6 on Windows XP.  It should be noted that HTTP/2
   introduces the Alt-SVC method for upgrading the connection from
   HTTP/1 to either unencrypted or encrypted HTTP/2.  If the initial
   HTTP/1 request is unencrypted, the destination alternate service name
   can be identified before the communication is potentially upgraded to
   encrypted HTTP/2 transport.  HTTP/2 implementations MUST support the
   Server Name Indication (SNI) extension.

   Limitation: This information is only visible if the client is
   populating the Server Name Indication extension.  This need not be
   done, but may be done as per TLS standard.  Therefore, even if
   existing network filters look out for seeing a Server Name Indication
   extension, they may not find one.  The per-domain nature of SNI may
   not reveal the specific service or media type being accessed,
   especially where the domain is of a provider offering a range of
   email, video, Web pages etc.  For example, certain blog or social
   network feeds may be deemed 'adult content', but the Server Name
   Indication will only indicate the server domain rather than a URL
   path to be blocked.

   Obscured from network by: not providing the SNI, IPSec

3.3.  Application Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN)

   ALPN is a TLS extenion which may be used to indicate the application
   protocol within the TLS session.  This is likely to be of more value
   to the network where it indicates a protocol dedicated to a
   particular traffic type (such as video streaming) rather than a
   multi-use protocol.  ALPN is used as part of HTTP/2 'h2', but will
   not indicate the traffic types which may make up streams within an
   HTTP/2 multiplex.

3.4.  DiffServ Code Points (DSCP)

   Data packets are flagged with a traffic class (class of service).
   Network operators may honour a DiffServ classification entering their
   network, or may choose to override it (since it is potentially open
   to abuse by a service provider that classifies all its content as



Smith                   Expires November 9, 2015                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft        encrypted-traffic-management              May 2015


   high priority).  The purpose is to help manage traffic and congestion
   in the network.

   Limitations: This requires the content provider to flag data packets.
   This is extra work for the provider, and it has potential for abuse
   if a content provider simply flags all packets with high priorities.
   The network would need to know which flags to trust and which to
   override.  The use of DiffServ within the operator network is
   beneficial where the operator determines the class of service itself;
   but where content is encrypted then heuristics would be needed to
   predict the traffic type entering the network.  HTTP/2 allows several
   streams to be multiplexed over a single TCP connection.  This means
   that if a provider decides to send Web pages, videos, chat etc. as
   individual streams over the same connection, then DiffServ would be
   useless as it would apply to the TCP/IP connection as a whole.
   However it may be more efficient for such Web providers to serve each
   content type from separate, dedicated servers - this will become
   clearer as HTTP/2 deployments are tuned for optimal delivery.

3.5.  Explicit Congestion Notification

   Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) routers can exchange
   congestion notification headers to ECN compliant endpoints.  This is
   in preference to inferring congestion from dropped packets (e.g. in
   TCP).  The purpose is to help manage traffic and congestion in the
   network.

   This solution is required to be implemented at network and service
   provider.  The service provider will utilise the ECN to reduce
   throughput until it is notified that congestion has eased.

   Limitation: As with DiffServ, operators may not trust an external
   entity to mark packets in a fair/consistent manner.

3.6.  Multi Protocol Label Switching

   Description: on entering an MPLS-compliant network, IP packets are
   flagged with a 'Forward Equivalence Class' (FEC).  This allows the
   network to make packet-forwarding decisions according to their
   latency requirements.  MPLS routers within the network parse and act
   upon the FEC value.  The FEC is set according to the source IP
   address and port.  The purpose is to help managing traffic and
   congestion in the network.  This requires deployment of an MPLS
   'backbone' with label-aware switches/ routers.

   Limitations: an up-to-date correspondence table between Websites and
   server IP address must be created.  Then, the category(s) of traffic

   have to be consistently mapped to a set of MPLS labels ,which entails
   a significant effort to setup and maintain.

   Note: MPLS can specify how OSI Layer 3 (IP layer) traffic can be
   routed over Layer 2 (Data Link); DiffServ only operates over Layer 3.
   DiffServ is potentially a less complex integration as it is applied
   at the network edge servers only.

4.  Inferred flow information

4.1.  Heuristics

   Heuristics can be used to map given input data to particular
   conclusions via some heuristic reasoning.  Examples of input data to
   this reasoning include IP destination address, TCP destination port,
   server name from SNI, typical traffic pattern (e.g. occurrence of IP
   packets and TCP segments over time).  The accuracy of heuristics
   depends on whether the observed traffic originates from a source
   delivering a single service, or a blend of services.  In many
   scenarios, this makes it possible to directly classify the traffic
   related to a specific server/service even when the traffic is fully
   encrypted.

   If the server/service is co-located on an infrastructure with other
   services that shares the same IP-address, the encrypted traffic
   cannot be directly classified.  However, commercial traffic
   classifiers today typically apply heuristic methods, using traffic
   pattern matching algorithms to be able to identify the traffic.  As
   an example, classifier products are able to identify popular VoIP
   services using heuristic methods although the traffic is encrypted
   and mostly peer-to-peer.

5.  Providing hints to and from the network

   The following draft protocols aim to support a secure and privacy-
   aware dialogue between client, server and a network middlebox.  This
   follows the cooperative path to endpoint signalling as discussed at
   the IAB SEMI workshop [SEMI], with the network following a more
   clearly-defined role in encrypted traffic delivery.  These hints can
   allow information item exchange between the endpoints and the
   network, to assist queuing mechanisms and traffic pacing that
   accounts for network congestion and variable connection strength.

5.1.  Substrate Protocol for User Datagrams (SPUD)

   SPUD [SPUD] allows network devices on the path between endpoints to
   participate explicitly in a 'tube' of grouped UDP packets.  The
   network involvement is outside of the end-to-end context, to minimise

   any privacy or security breach.  The initial prototype is based on
   UDP packets but will investigate the support of additional transport
   layers (such as TCP).

5.2.  Mobile throughput Guidance

   Mobile Throughput Guidance In-band Signalling [MTG] allows the
   network to inform the server endpoint as to what bandwidth the TCP
   connection can reasonably expect.  This allows the server to adapt
   their throughput pacing based on dynamic network conditions, which
   can assist mechanisms such as Adaptive Bitrate Streaming and TCP
   congestion control.

6.  Acknowledgements

   The editor would like to thank the GSMA Web Working Group for their
   contributions, in particular to the technical solutions and network
   management functions.

7.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA consideraions.

8.  Security Considerations

   The intention of this document is to consider how to persist network
   management of encrypted traffic, without breaching user privacy or
   end-to-end security.  In particular this document does not recommend
   any approach that intercepts or modifies client-server Transport
   Layer Security.
