Internet-Draft   IP Deployment over IEEE 802.16 Networks       June 2006


1.  Introduction

   A public mobile services are provided based on circuit switched radio
   technology that enables mobility management, terminal status
   management.  The major services are voice, however user's
   requirements are shifted to data service such as instant messaging,
   image transmission, video clip streaming and so on.  It is difficult
   to satisfy emerging requirements by the advanced technology such as
   evolution of cdma2000 1x for data only (EV-DO), evolution of cdma2000
   1x for both data and voice (EV-DV) and so on.  The evolution of
   technologies for mobile network will be based on IP technologies.

   On the other hand, IP based networks are rapidly growing due to
   deployment of backbone network technologies and access network
   technologies.  The backbone network technologies are 10 Gigabit
   Ethernet, 10 Gigabit Packet over SONET with dense wavelength division
   multiplexing (DWDM).  The access network technologies for high speed
   Internet service are digital subscriber line (DSL), cable network and
   fiber to the home (FTTH) such as metro ethernet and combination of
   DSL and FTTH.  However, wire-based high Internet access can not
   provide mobility requirement of the users.  IEEE 802.11 technology is
   developed to cope with mobility issues on Internet.

   High speed mobile technologies evolved from voice network have
   excellent mobility management up to 120Km per hour, but it has to
   solve the high speed data rate to the user.  An wired and Wireless
   LAN can provid excellent data rate compared with evolving mobile
   based voice network, but it has to solve mobility and cell coverage
   issues.  IEEE 802.16 specifies a new air interface and medium access
   control (MAC) protocol to provide both high data rate and large cell
   coverage.  In addition, IEEE 802.16e provides seamless mobility so
   that mobile users can use wireless Internet services while they are
   moving on vehicles.  Broadband Wireless Access (BWA) is still in the
   early stage of its growth.  WiBro, wireless broadband, is one of the
   profiles for IEEE 802.16 standards.  It provides high-speed data rate
   more than IEEE 801.11 technology and mobility function as 3G
   networks.  A third-generation capabilities from a network perspective
   implies packet switching, Internet access and IP connectivity
   capabilities.

   This document introduces an WiBro, Wireless Broadband, network based
   on IEEE 802.16 technology.  IEEE 802.16 are air interface
   specifiction for fixed and mobile broadband wireless system.  WiBro
   is one of the profiles of IEEE 802.16.  It depicts network
   architecture based on ISP's experience of trial service and specifies
   frame format for reference point based on network architecture.  It
   describes evolution of IPv6 deployment over IEEE 802.16 network with
   three phases.  It lists issues of improvement for IP over IEEE 802.16

   and IPv6 evolution.


2.  Terminology Used in This Document

   Telecommunication Technology Association (TTA):
      The TTA is a standardization organization in Korea.  The WiBro
      standard is one of the specifications developed by TTA.

   Subscriber station (SS):
      A generalized equipment set providing connectivity between
      subscriber equipment and a base station.  It is generally accepted
      for fixed terminal with IEEE complient interface that defind by
      IEEE 802.16.  The SS can be either fixed station or mobile
      station.

   Mobile Station (MS):
      A station in the mobile service intended to be used while in
      motion or during halts at unspecified points.  An MS is always a
      subscriber station which must provide mobility function.

   Radio Access Station (RAS):
      A generalized equipment set providing connectivity between mobile
      station defined for WiBro in TTA.  This is a part of base station
      in IEEE 802.16.

   Access Control Router (ACR):
      A generalized equipment set providing connectivity between RAS and
      IP network defined for WiBro in TTA.  This is a part of base
      station in IEEE 802.16.

   Base Station (BS):
      A generalized equipment set providing connectivity, management,
      and control of the subscriber station is defined in IEEE 802.16.
      A BS is decomposed of RAS and ACR which is defined in TTA.

   Access Service Network (ASN):
      An ASN is a logical boundary and aggregation of functional
      entities defined in WiMAX Forum.  An ASN is composed of BS and ASN
      gateway.  It is clear relationship between TTA and WiMAX; what RAS
      is to WiBro, BS is to WiMAX.  ACR is to WiBro as ASN gateway in to
      WiMAX.
      An ASN is the same architecture as BS defined by IEEE 802.16.
      Therefore, BS in terms of IEEE 802.16 includes RAS and ACR.

Internet-Draft   IP Deployment over IEEE 802.16 Networks       June 2006


   Edge Router (ER):
      An edge router is a device that routes data packet between ASN and
      CSN.

   Connectivity Service Network (CSN):
      An CSN is a set of network functions that provide IP connectivity
      service to the subscriber station defined by WiMAX.

   Reference Point U:
      An U reference point is between SS and BS defined by TTA and IEEE
      802.16.  WiMAX defines R1 reference point between SS and BS.  The
      U and R1 are the same reference point.

   Reference Point A:
      An A reference point is between RAS and ACR defined by TTA.  IEEE
      802.16 does not define for this reference point because one BS
      consists of RASs and ACR.  WiMAX defines R6 reference point
      between BS and ASN gateway.  The A and R6 are the same reference
      point.

   Reference Point I:
      An I reference point is between ACR and ER defined by TTA.  WiMAX
      defines more detailed reference point that R3 for between ASN and
      CSN, R2 for between SS and CSN, R5 for between CSN and CSN.  The I
      and R3 are the same reference point.  The other reference point
      such as R2 and R5 are not general in terms of network
      architecture.

   Wireless Broadband (WiBro):
      An WiBro is one of the profiles for IEEE 802.16 standard developed
      by TTA.


3.  WiBro Profile based on IEEE 802.16

   IEEE 802.16 standard supports a wide range of frequencies upto 66GHz,
   channel size from 1.25MHz to 20MHz, radio characteristics both non-
   line-of-sight and line-of-sight and network configuration between SS
   and BS such as point to multipoint and mesh.  The WiBro must comply
   with IEEE 802.16-2004 and IEEE 802.16e-2005.  The profiles for WiBro
   are as following.

   Duplex
      Duplex is a bidirectional communication scheme between MS and RAS.
      It can be classified into half-duplex and full-duplex.  A full-
      duplex method can achive either frequency division duplex (FDD) or
      time division duplex (TDD).  FDD requires two channels, one for
      uplink and the other for downlink traffic.  TDD network traffic

Internet-Draft   IP Deployment over IEEE 802.16 Networks       June 2006


      uses a single channel with uplink and downlink traffic assigned to
      different time slots.  WiBro uses time division duplex.

   Frequency Band and Channel Allocation
      The frequency bands for WiBro is from 2.3GHz to 2.4GHz that is
      divided into three bands for service provider (SP).  A channel
      bandwidth is 9MHz and guard band between service provider is
      4.5MHz.  The frequency allocation as shown in Figure 1.

   +---------------+--------+----------------+--------+----------------+
   |    1st band   |  guard | 2nd band (SP2) |  guard | 3rd band (SP3) |
   |     (SP1)     |  band  |                |  band  |                |
   +---------------+--------+----------------+--------+----------------+
   |  29MHz (3 CH) | 4.5MHz |  29MHz (3 CH)  | 4.5MHz |  29MHz (3 CH)  |
   +---------------+--------+----------------+--------+----------------+

                  Figure 1.  Channel allocation in WiBro

   Multiple Access
      The IEEE 802.16 specifies multiple access methods: frequency
      division multiple access (FDMA), time division multiple access
      (TDMA), OFDM, OFDMA.  A multiple access scheme between SS/MS and
      RAS is othogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) in
      WiBro.

   Data Rate
      An uplink data rate per user is minimum 128Kbps and maximum 1Mbps
      for data traffic at the cell edge.  A downlink traffic per user
      between 512Kbps and 3Mbps, respectively.
      A handover time is less than 150ms under the 60Km/hour condition.

   Frequency Reuse Factor
      An uplink data rate per user is minimum 128Kbps and maximum 1Mbps
      for data traffic at the cell edge.  A downlink traffic per user
      between 512Kbps and 3Mbps, respectively.
      A frequency reuse factor is specified to 1.  A maximum frequency
      efficiency is 6bps/Hz/Cell for downlink and 2bps/Hz/Cell for
      uplink respectively.

   Roaming among the Service Provider
      A service provider for WiBro should support roaming to the users.

   reference point U.

   - Supporting session connection, continuity and disconnection with
   IEEE 802.16 management messages.

   - Handover function and radio resource management for MS.

   - Radio resource management.

4.2.  IPv4 Deployment

   The IEEE 802.16 MAC comprises of three sublayers; service specific
   convergence sublayer (CS), MAC common part sublayer, security
   sublayer.

   Multiple CSs are defined to use various protocols such as ATM CS and
   packet CS.  Packet CS supports IEEE 802.3, IEEE 802.1Q, IPv4 and IPv6
   via their own specific CS.

   There are three ways to use IPv4 packet CS at reference point U; IPv4
   over IEEE 802.16, IPv4 over IEEE 802.3 over IEEE 802.16 and IPv4 over
   IEEE 802.1Q over IEEE 802.16.  The WiBro uses IPv4 over IEEE 802.16
   at reference point U.

4.2.1.  Frame format for reference point U

   In Figure 3, L2 is the IEEE 802.16 header and trailer format.The L3
   is the IPv4 header format.
   When the Ethernet CS is used, Ethernet header should be inserted
   between L2 header and L3 header in Figure 3[1-3].

   H: Header Type (1 bit).  Shall be set to zero indicating that it is a
   Generic MAC PDU.

   E: Encryption Control (1 bit). 0 = Payload is not encrypted; 1 =
   Payload is encrypted.

   Type (6 bit).  This field indicates the subheaders and special
   payload types present in the message payload.
   The subheader types are mesh subheader, fragmentation subheader,
   packing subheader and FAST-FEEDBACK allocation subheader.
   The special payload is ARQ feedback payload.

   E: Extended subheader field (1 bit). 0 = the extended subheader is
   absent; 1 = the extended subheader is present.  The ESF is applicable
   both in the downlink and in the uplink.

   C: CRC indicator (1 bit). 0 = CRC is not included; 1 = CRC is

5.  Evolution to IPv6 over IEEE 802.16

   IPv6 service should be provided without affecting IPv4 service.  An
   ISP can prepare IPv6 deployment by following three phases.

5.1.  IPv4 Service with IPv6 ready: Phase 1

   In phase 1, Internet Service is launched based on IPv4 with network
   architecture shown in Figure 2.
   While Internet still support IPv4-only, ER can support IPv4/IPv6 dual

   stacks.  An ASN equipment that comply with IEEE 802.16 may support
   IPv6 with dual stack.  However dual stack in ASN equipment is not
   enabled during phase 1.  Tunneling protocol among ERs is defined but
   not be used.
   In this phase, the network delivers IPv4 traffic only.  And MSs are
   based on IPv4.

   Figure 6 shows IP functionalities among the network elements based on
   network architecture.

5.2.  Partial Use of IPv6: Phase 2

   In phase 2, the ISP starts offering IPv6 service over IEEE 802.16
   partially.

   An ASN equipment and ERs enable IPv4/IPv6 dualstack.  IPv4 and IPv6
   traffic is delivered independantly.  IPv4 traffic is delivered as
   same as in phase 1.  IPv6 traffic is delivered through tunnels
   between ERs in Internet.  Because, the Internet does not support full
   IPv6.

   Figure 7 shows IP functionalities among the network elements based on
   network architecture.

5.3.  Full dual stack: Phase 3

   In phase 3, the ISP provides stable IPv6 service due to whole
   networks can operate dual stack.  The Internet can deliver IPv6
   traffic without IPv4-IPv6 tunneling protocol.  The IPv4/IPv6 dual
   stack is enabled not only in ASN but also in CSN including Internet.

   However, there are IPv4-only MSs, IPv4/IPv6 dual stack MSs and IPv6-
   olny MSs.  An IPv4-only MSs use IPv4.  The IPv4/IPv6 dual stack MSs
   and IPv6-olny MSs use IPv6.
