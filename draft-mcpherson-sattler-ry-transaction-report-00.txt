Internet-Draft          Registry Transaction Report        November 2018

1.  Introduction

   Modern top-level domain registries provide a number of detailed
   reports and documents that their registrars require on a daily,
   weekly and monthly basis. These most commonly include transaction
   reports, as well as lists containing currently unavailable domains
   and current premium domains. These reports are critical for
   registrars' businesses and play an important role in accounting and
   operations processes as well as in sales and marketing activities.
   In the current set-up registrars must download these reports from
   each registry's intranet in a different manner according to each
   registry's own document management set up.
   
   This document describes the content of a Transaction Report based on
   the [I-D.mcpherson-sattler-registry-report-structure] and delivered
   by the [I-D.mcpherson-sattler-registry-reporting-repo].

2.  Terminology and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] when
   specified in their uppercase forms.
   
2.1.  Internationalized Domain Names

   MUST be as defined in
   [I-D.mcpherson-sattler-registry-report-structure].

2.2.  Dates and Times

   MUST be as defined in
   [I-D.mcpherson-sattler-registry-report-structure].

              registry within the report period.

Internet-Draft          Registry Transaction Report        November 2018
              
   UPDATE     A successful billable domain name update within the report
              period.
              
   RESTORE    A successful domain name restore within the report period.
              This event MUST only include the restore fee. Any
              additional renewal fee MUST be independently listed.

5.  Transaction Periods
   
   Transaction Types usually occur in periods of 1 to 10 years,
   sometimes there are monthly periods. Therefore, each transaction MUST
   have a period associated.
   
   The format MUST be in the format <integer><character>, where
   <integer> MUST be between 1 and 99, without any leading zero, and
   <charter> MUST be either 'y' for years or 'm' for months.
   
   If the number of months results in a full year, then the full year
   MUST be used, e.g. instead of 12m or 24m, it should be 1y
   respectively 2y.
   
   The period MAY be empty if no period is assign to the transaction.
   
6.  Transaction Fees

   All transactions MUST have a fee associated. The fee amount, the
   currency and the period MUST be listed separately.
   
   Fees MUST either be whole numbers or rounded to two decimal places.
   A period is used as the dividing point.

6.1.  Deviating Fees

   If a domain name incurs a non-standard premium fee, a description
   of the price category SHOULD be given.

7.  Registrar ID

   A unique registrar ID MUST be listed, with each transaction. Those
   IDs MUST be according the IANA Registrars IDs (https://www.iana.org/
   assignments/registrar-ids/registrar-ids.xhtml) where applicable,
   otherwise another unique registrar ID MUST be used.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
   
10.  Security Considerations

   The registry reporting reports described in this document do not
   provide any security services.

11.  Implementation Status

   Note to RFC Editor: Please remove this section and the reference to
   [RFC7942] before publication.

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [RFC7942], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature. It
   is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

   Add implementation details once available.
