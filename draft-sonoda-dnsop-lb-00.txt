                        draft-sonoda-dnsop-lb-00

Abstract

   This document defines a new DNS load balance function that is able to
   transfer information in zone transfer and not need online signing.
   DNS base load balance is popular technology.  It provides weight base
   response and location base response.  It have become an indispensable
   part of traffic engineering.  However, DNS base load balance can't
   transfer load balance information in zone transfer and need online
   singing because it is not standardized.  This document defines a new
   DNS resource record called "LB".  LB RR provides the balancing
   information weight, location and target domain name.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Legacy DNS load balancing

   Legacy DNS load balancing provides traffic engineering.It use special
   authoritative name server.  It response is one address record that is
   dynamic changes using network location and weight.  It's used for
   large traffic WEB site domain name that is important domain name.
   Important domain name should be secure.

   But legacy DNS load balancing is not secure.  Because Legacy DNS load
   balancing can't send zone data by zone transfer.  It's mean very
   difficult to use multi service providers.  That means weak for DDoS
   Attack.  If zone is signed, All name servers require private key for
   dynamic signing because response is dynamic changes.  Distributing
   private key is not secure, It is increased risk of leakage private
   key.

1.2.  New DNS load balancing

   New DNS load balancing concept is that Authoritative name server uses
   "LB" RR to provide load balancing information and Clients application
   uses "LB" RR to select target name.

   "LB" RR defines load balancing settings that is network location and
   weight and target domain name.  Network location is string that
   meaningful name of network.  For example Country code (ex.
   JP),subdivision code(ex.  US-CA) and Autonomous System Number (ex.
   AS65536).  Weight is ratio value to use select target name.  Target
   name is pointer to address record.

   "server.location" is special TXT record that is location information
   at full service resolver.  Application can use this value for
   location selection.

2.  The LB Resource Record

   The LB RR has mnemonic LB.  LB RR define load balancing information.

   LB format below.

         <owner> <ttl> <class> LB <weight> <location> <target>

   The format is not class-sensitive.  All fields are required.

   <weight> field is a 2 octets, 1 or more natural number.

   <location> field is a "<character-string>" [RFC1035].

   <target> field is a "<domain-name>" [RFC1035].

2.1.  Define location

   <location> ::= "*" | <continental code> | <country code> |
   <subdivision code> | <asn code> | <private code>

   <region code> ::= "AF" | "NA" | "AS" | "EU" | "NA" | "OC" | "SA"

   <country code> ::= ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 Country code.

   <subdivision code> ::= ISO 3166-2 Codes for the representation of
   names of countries and their subdivisions.

   <asn code> ::= "AS" <asn> [ ":" <asn>]

   <private code> ::= "+" <let>

   <ans> ::= <nonzero digit> <digit>

   <nonzero digit> ::= any one of the ten digits 1 through 9

   <digit> ::= any one of the ten digits 0 through 9

   <let> ::= any one of the 26 alphabetic characters A through Z in
   upper case or any one of the ten digits 0 through 9.

2.2.  Record example

   example.jp. 3600 IN LB 1 * www.example.com. ; for any region
   example.jp. 3600 IN LB 1 AS as.example.com. ; for ASIA region
   example.jp. 3600 IN LB 1 JP jp1.example.jp. ; for JP region, weight 1
   example.jp. 3600 IN LB 3 JP jp2.example.jp. ; for JP region, weight 3
   example.jp. 3600 IN LB 1 JP-13 tokyo.example.jp. ; for tokyo region
   example.jp. 3600 IN LB 1 AS2496 as65536.example.jp.   ; for AS65536
   example.jp. 3600 IN LB 1 AS2496:1 as65536.example.jp. ; for AS65536
   example.jp. 3600 IN LB 1 +BEER beer.example.jp.       ; private use

3.  Full service resolver's location

   "server.location" is special TXT record that is location information
   at full service resolver.  Application can use this value to select
   records.

3.1.  Record example

      server.localtion 0 CH TXT "AS2479" "JP-13" "JP" "AS" "*"

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a DNS RR data type value for the LB RR
   type under the "Resource Record (RR) TYPEs" sub-registry under the
   "Domain Name System (DNS) Parameters" registry.
