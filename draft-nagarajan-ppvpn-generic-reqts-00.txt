1. Introduction


1.1. Summary for Sub-IP area

   This document is an output of the design team formed to develop
   requirements  for PPVPNs in the PPVPN working group.  As such this
   work fits within the  scope of the PPVPN working group.  This
   document discusses generic PPVPN  requirements categorized as
   service, provider and engineering requirements.   These are
   independent of any particular type of PPVPN technology.


1.2. Problem Statement

   Corporations and other organizations have become increasingly
   dependent on  their networks for tele- and datacommunication. The
   data communication  networks were originally built as Local Area
   Networks (LAN). Over time  the  possibility to interconnect the
   networks on different sites has become more  and more  important. The
   connectivity for corporate networks has been  supplied by service
   providers, mainly as FR or ATM connections, but over  recent years
   also as Ethernet and IP-based tunnels. This type of network,
   interconnecting a number of sites over a shared network
   infrastructure is called Virtual Private  Network (VPN).  If the
   sites belong to the same organization, the VPN is called an Intranet.
   If the sites belong to different organizations that share a common
   interest, the VPN is called an Extranet.

   Customers are looking for service providers to deliver data and
   telecom connectivity over one or more shared networks,with service
   level assurances  in the form of security, QoS and other parameters.

   In order to provide isolation between the traffic belong to different
   customers, mechanisms such as Layer 2 connections or Layer 2/3
   tunnels are  necessary. When the shared infrastructure is an IP
   network, the tunneling  technologies that are typically used are
   IPsec, MPLS, L2TP, GRE, IP-in-IP  etc.

   Traditional Internet VPNs have been based on IPsec to provide
   security over  the Internet. Service providers are now beginning to
   deploy enhanced VPN  services that provide features such as service
   differentiation, traffic  management, Layer 2 and Layer 3
   connectivity, etc. in addition to security.  Newer tunneling
   mechanisms have certain features that allow the service  providers to
   provide these enhanced VPN services.

   The VPN solutions we define now must be able to accommodate the



                                                                [Page 2]





Internet Draft draft-nagarajan-ppvpn-generic-reqts-00.txt    March, 2003


   traditional  types of VPNs as well as the enhanced services now being
   deployed. They need  to be able to run in a single service provider's
   network, as well as between a set of service providers and across the
   Internet. In doing so the VPNs should not be allowed to violate basic
   Internet design principles or overload the Internet core routers or
   accelarate the growths of the Internet  routing tables. In order to
   achieve this, the mechanisms used to develop  various PPVPN solutions
   SHALL be as common as possible with generic Internet  infrastructure
   mechanisms like discovery, signaling, routing and management.



1.3. Outline of this document

   This document describes generic requirements for Provider Provisioned
   Virtual Private Networks (PPVPN). The document contains several
   sections,  with each set representing a significant aspect of PPVPN
   requirements.  Section 2 lists authors who contributed to this
   document. Section 3 defines terminology and presents a taxonomy of
   PPVPN  technologies. The taxonomy contains two broad classes,
   representing Layer 2  and Layer 3 VPNs. Each top level VPN class
   contains subordinate classes. For  example, the Layer 3 VPN class
   contains a subordinate class of PE-based  Layer 3 VPNs.  Sections 4,
   5, 6 describe generic PPVPN requirements.

   The requirements are broadly classified under the following
   categories:


   1) Service requirements - Service attributes that the customer can
   observe or measure. For example, does the service forward frames or
   route datagrams? What security guarantees does the service provide?
   Availability and  stability are key requirements in this category.

   2) Provider requirements - Characteristics that Service Providers use
   to determine the cost-effectiveness of a PPVPN service.  Scaling and
   management are examples of Provider requirements.

   3) Engineering requirements - Implementation characteristics that
   make service and provider requirements achievable.  These can be
   further classified as:

   3a) Forwarding plane requirements - e.g., requirements related to
   router forwarding behavior.

   3b) Control plane requirements - e.g., requirements related to
   reachability and distribution of reachability information.




                                                                [Page 3]

   3c) Requirements related to the commonality of PPVPN mechanisms with
   generic Internet mechanisms.

Internet Draft draft-nagarajan-ppvpn-generic-reqts-00.txt    March, 2003


    definitions that are not covered in [TERMINOLOGY] are given below:

   CE-based VPN: A VPN approach in which the shared service provider
   network does not have any knowledge of the customer VPN. This
   information is limited to CE equipment.

   PE-Based VPNs: A layer 3 VPN approach in which a service provider
   network is used to interconnect customer sites using shared
   resources. Specifically the PE device maintains VPN state, isolating
   users of one VPN from users of another VPN. Because the PE device
   maintains all required VPN state, the CE device may behave as if it
   were connected to a private network. Specifically, the CE in a PE-
   based VPN must not require any changes or additional functionality to
   be connected to a PPVPN instead of a private network.

   Virtual Router (VR) style: A PE-based VPN approach in which the PE
   router maintains a complete logical router for each VPN that it
   supports. Each  logical router maintains a unique forwarding table
   and executes a unique  instance of the routing protocols.  These VPNs
   are described in [PPVPN-VR].

   RFC 2547 Style: A PE-based VPN approach in which the PE router
   maintains  separate forwarding environment for each VPN and a
   separate forwarding table  for each VPN. In order to maintain
   multiple forwarding table instances while running only a single
   routing protocol instance, RFC 2547 style VPNs mark route
   advertisements with attributes that identify their VPN context. These
   VPNs are based on the approach described in [RFC2547bis].


4. Service requirements

   These are the requirements that a customer can observe or measure, in
   order  to verify if the PPVPN service that the Service Provider (SP)
   provides is satisfactory.


4.1. Availability

   VPN services must have high availability.  VPNs that are distributed
   over several sites require connectivity to be maintained even in the
   event of network failures or degraded service.  This  can be achieved
   via various redundancy techniques such as:

   1. Multihoming

   A single site connected to multiple CEs (for CE-based PPVPN) or PEs
   (for  PE-based PPVPNs), or different POPs, or even different service



                                                                [Page 5]





Internet Draft draft-nagarajan-ppvpn-generic-reqts-00.txt    March, 2003


   providers

    or

   2. via tunnel redundancy.



4.2. Stability

   In addition to availability, VPN services must also be stable.
   Stability is a function of several components such as VPN routing,
   signaling and discovery mechanisms, in addition to tunnel stability.
   Stability of the VPN service is directly related to the stability of
   the mechanisms and protocols used to establish the service.


4.3. Traffic types

   VPN services must support unicast (or point to point) traffic and
   should  support any-to-any traffic including multicast and broadcast
   traffic. In the broadcast model, the network delivers a stream to all
   members of a subnetwork, regardless of their interest in that stream.
   In the multicast model, the network delivers a stream to a set of
   destinations that have registered interest in the stream. All
   destinations need not belong to the same subnetwork. Multicast is
   more appropriate to L3 VPNs while broadcast is more appropriate for
   L2VPNs.  It is highly desirable  to support multicast limited in
   scope to an intranet or extranet. The solution should be  able to
   support a large number of such intranet or extranet specific
   multicast groups in a scalable manner.

   A PPVPN shall support both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.


4.4. Data isolation


   The PPVPN must support forwarding plane isolation. The network must
   never deliver user data accross VPN boundaries unless the two VPNs
   participate in an intranet or extranet.

   Furthermore, if the provider network receives signaling or routing
   information from one VPN, it must not reveal that information to
   another VPN unless the two VPNs participate in an intranet or
   extranet.





                                                                [Page 6]





Internet Draft draft-nagarajan-ppvpn-generic-reqts-00.txt    March, 2003


4.5. Security

   A range of security features should be supported by the suite of
   PPVPN solutions [VPN SEC]. Each PPVPN solution should state which
   security features it supports and how such features can be configured
   on a per customer basis. Protection against Denial of Service (DoS)
   attacks is a key component of security mechanisms.



4.5.1. User data security

   PPVPN solutions that support user data security should use standard
   methods  (e.g., IPsec) to achieve confidentiality, integrity,
   authentication and  replay attack prevention.



4.5.2. Access control

   A PPVPN solution may also have the ability to activate the
   appropriate filtering capabilities upon request of a customer. A
   filter provides a mechanism so that access control can be invoked at
   the point(s) of communication between different organizations
   involved in an extranet.  Access control can be implemented by a
   firewall, access control lists on routers or similar mechanisms to
   apply policy-based access control to transit traffic.


4.5.3. Site authentication and authorization

   A PPVPN solution requires authentication and authorization of the
   following:

       - temporary and permanent access for users connecting to sites
         (authentication and authorization BY the site)

       - the site itself (authentication and authorization FOR the site)


4.5.4. Inter domain security

   The VPN solution must have appropriate security mechanisms to prevent
   Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, misconfiguration or
   unauthorized accesses in inter domain PPVPN connections.






                                                                [Page 7]





Internet Draft draft-nagarajan-ppvpn-generic-reqts-00.txt    March, 2003


4.6. Topology

   A VPN should support arbitrary, customer agent defined inter-site
   connectivity, ranging, for example, from hub-and-spoke, partial mesh
   to full  mesh topology.  These can actually be different from the
   topology used by the service provider. To the extent possible, a
   PPVPN service should be independent  of the geographic extent of the
   deployment.

   A VPN solution should support multiple VPNs per customer site without
   requiring additional hardware resources per VPN. It should also
   support a free mix of L2 and L3 VPNs per customer site.

   To the extent possible, the PPVPN services should be independent of
   access
    network technology.


4.7. Addressing (support for private, overlapping addresses)

   Each customer resource must be identified by an address that is
   unique within its VPN. It need not be identified by a globally unique
   address.

   A VPN service shall be capable of supporting non-IP customer
   addresses if it  is a Layer 2 VPN (e.g., Frame Relay, ATM, Ethernet).
   Support for non-IP Layer 3 addresses may be desirable in some cases,
   but is beyond the scope of VPN solutions developed in the IETF.



4.8. Quality of Service

   To the extent possible, the QoS capability of a PPVPN should be
   independent  of the access network technology.  A PPVPN shall be able
   to support QoS via IETF standardized mechanisms such as Diffserv.
   Support for best-effort traffic shall be mandatory for all PPVPN
   types.

   Note that all cases involving QoS may require that the CE and/or PE
   perform shaping and/or policing.

   The need to provide QoS will occur primarily in the access network,
   since that will often be the bottleneck. This is likely to occur
   since the backbone effectively statistically multiplexes many users,
   and is traffic engineerd or includes capacity for restoration and
   growth. There are two directions of QoS management that must be
   considered in any PPVPN service regarding QoS:



                                                                [Page 8]





Internet Draft draft-nagarajan-ppvpn-generic-reqts-00.txt    March, 2003


        - From the CE across the access network to the PE
        - From the PE across the access network to CE

   PPVPN CE and PE devices should be capable of supporting QoS across a
   subset of access networks, such as:

        - ATM Virtual Connections (VCs)
        - Frame Relay Data Link Connection Identifiers (DLCIs)
        - 802.1d Prioritized Ethernet
        - MPLS-based access
        - Multilink Multiclass PPP
        - QoS-enabled wireless (e.g., LMDS, MMDS)
        - Cable modem
        - QoS-enabled Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)

   Different service models for QoS may be supported.  Examples of PPVPN
   QoS service models are:

      - Managed access service : Provides QoS on the access connection
   between CE and the customer facing ports of the PE.  No QoS support
   is required in the provider core network in this case.

      - Edge-to-edge QoS : Provides QoS across the provider core, either
   between CE pairs or PE pairs, depending on the tunnel demarcation
   points.  This scenario requires QoS support in the provider core
   network.


4.9. Service Level Agreement and Service Level Specification Monitoring
   and Reporting

   A Service Level Specification (SLS) may be defined per access network
   connection, per VPN, per VPN site, and/or per VPN route. The service
   provider may define objectives and the measurement interval for at
   least the SLS using the following Service Level Objective (SLO)
   parameters:

        - QoS and traffic parameters for the Intserv flow or Diffserv
   class

        - Availability for the site, VPN, or access connection

        - Duration of outage intervals per site, route or VPN

        - Service activation interval (e.g., time to turn up a new site)

        - Trouble report response time interval




                                                                [Page 9]





Internet Draft draft-nagarajan-ppvpn-generic-reqts-00.txt    March, 2003


        - Time to repair interval

        - Total traffic offered to the site, route or VPN

        - Measure of non-conforming traffic for the site, route or VPN

        - Delay and delay variation (jitter) bounds

        - Packet ordering, at least when transporting L2 services
   sensitive to reordering (e.g., ATM).

   The above list contains items from [Y.1241], as well as other items
   typically part of SLAs for currently deployed VPN services [FRF.13].
   See [RFC3198] for generic definitions of SLS, SLA, and SLO.

   The provider network management system shall measure, and report as
   necessary, whether measured performance meets or fails to meet the
   above SLS objectives.

   The service provider and the customer may negotiate a contractual
   arrangement that includes a Service Level Agreement (SLA) regarding
   compensation if the provider does not meet an SLS performance
   objective. Details of such compensation are outside the scope of this
   document.


5. Provider requirements

   This section describes operational requirements for a cost-effective,
   profitable VPN service offering.


5.1. Scalability

   The scalability for VPN solutions has many aspects. The list below is
   intended to comprise of the aspects that PPVPN solutions should
   address.  Clearly these aspects in absolute figures are very
   different for different types of VPNs - i.e., a point to point
   service has only two sites, while a VPLS or L3VPN may have a larger
   number of sites. It is also important to verify that PPVPN solutions
   not only scales on the high end, a VPN with three sites and three
   users should be as viable as a VPN with hundreds of sites and
   thousands of users.

   Terminology:

   Site: a geographical location with one or more users or one or more
   servers or a combination of servers and users.



                                                               [Page 10]





Internet Draft draft-nagarajan-ppvpn-generic-reqts-00.txt    March, 2003


   User: the end user equipment (hosts), e.g., a workstation.

   Note: Further discussion on Section 5.1.1 and 5.1.2 is needed.



5.1.1. VPN Scalability aspects

   This section describes the metrics for scaling PPVPN solutions,
   points out some of the scaling differences between L2 and L3 VPNs.
   Further discussion on service provider sizing projections are in
   Section 5.1.2.


5.1.1.1. Number of users per VPN

   The number of users per VPN is the combination of servers and hosts
   connected to the VPN. It needs to scale from a handful to extremely
   high numbers.

   Clearly there is a possible trade off between the number of users and
   the VPN technology chosen.

   L3 VPNs must scale from 2 users per VPN to 100000 users per VPN. L2
   VPNs must scale from 2 users to a few hundred.



5.1.1.2. Number of users per site

   The number of users per site follows the same logic as for users per
   VPN. Further, it must be possible to have single user sites connected
   to the same VPN as very large sites are connected to.

   L3 VPNs must scale from 1 user per site to thousands of users per
   site. L2 VPNs must scale from 1 user to a few hundred per site.


5.1.1.3. Number of sites per VPN

   The number of sites per VPN is clearly limited by the number of users
   for a L2 VPN. The largest number of sites in a L2VPN would be equal
   to the largest number of users, distributed one per site. For L3 VPNs
   number of sites per VPN should scale from 2 to very large numbers.
   The limiting factor is probably router memory, so the scaling point
   should be 100,000 sites.





                                                               [Page 11]





Internet Draft draft-nagarajan-ppvpn-generic-reqts-00.txt    March, 2003


5.1.1.4. Number of PEs

   The number of PEs that supports the same set of, i.e. the number of
   PEs that needs to directly exchange information on VPN de-
   multiplexing information is clearly a scaling factor. Protocols with
   direct peering between PEs to exchange de-multiplexing information
   and the functionality to fill, e.g., a VPLS-PE position, is unlikely
   to be able to support more than 1000 peering sessions. In a multi-AS
   and multi-SP network supporting the same set of VPNs, the required
   number of peering relationships easily comes to 10000 or more.



5.1.1.5. Number of sites per PE

   The number of sites per PE needs to be discussed based on several
   different scenarios. On the one hand there is a limitation to the
   number of customer facing interfaces that the PE can support. On the
   other hand the access network may aggregate several sites connected
   on comparatively low bandwidth on to one single high bandwidth
   interface on the PE. The scaling point here is that the PE must be
   able to support a few or even a single site on the low end and
   several thousands of sites on the high end.



5.1.1.6. Number of VPNs in the network

   The number of sites in a network should not be a scaling issue. The
   number of VPNs should scale linearly with the size of the access
   network and the number of PEs.



5.1.1.7. Number of VPNs per PE

   This is a function of number of sites per PE and number of VPNs per
   site. It is estimated that the number of VPNs needs to be at least
   one order of magnitude higher than the number of sites per PE.












                                                               [Page 12]





Internet Draft draft-nagarajan-ppvpn-generic-reqts-00.txt    March, 2003


5.1.1.8. Number of VPNs per site

   On a customer's main site it is fully conceivable that the number of
   VPNs could be fairly large, both service diversification and
   separation of different work groups contributes to this. It is
   possible that one customer will run 20 or 30 VPNs.


5.1.1.9. Number of addresses per VPN

   For a L3 VPN this needs to scale from very few to almost Internet
   address table size. For a L2 VPN it would probably be possible to
   keep the number of address limited.



5.1.1.10. Number of addresses per PE

   This is a function of the number of VPNs per site and the number of
   addresses per site.



5.1.2. Service Provider Capacity Sizing Projections


   A PPVPN solution should be scalable to support a very large number of
   VPNs  per Service Provider network. The estimate is that a large
   service provider  will require support for on the order of 10,000
   VPNs within four years.

   A PPVPN solution should be scalable to support of a wide range of
   number of  site interfaces per VPN, depending on the size and/or
   structure of the  customer organization. The number of site
   interfaces should range from a few  site interfaces to over 50,000
   site interfaces per VPN.

   A PPVPN solution should be scalable to support of a wide range of
   number of  routes per VPN. The number of routes per VPN may range
   from just a few to  the number of routes exchanged between ISPs using
   BGP (on the order of  100,000). Typically, the number of routes per
   VPN are twice the number of site interfaces or larger.

   A PPVPN solution should support high values of the frequency of
   configuration setup and change, e.g. for real-time provisioning of an
   on-demand videoconferencing VPN. As a guideline, an estimate on the

   time unit)  could be as large as 1 million per year across all
   service providers within  the next four years.

   Approaches should articulate scaling and performance limits for more
   complex  deployment scenarios, such as inter-AS(S) VPNs and carriers'
   carrier.  Approaches should also describe other dimensions of
   interest, such as  capacity requirements or limits, number of
   interworking instances supported  as well as any scalability
   implications on management systems.

   A PPVPN solution should support a large number of customer interfaces
   on a single PE (for PE-based PPVPN) or CE (for CE-based PPVPN) with
   current Internet protocols.


5.1.3. Solution-Specific Metrics

   Each PPVPN solution shall document its scalability characteristics in
   quantitative terms. Two examples are provided below as an
   illustration.

   The following example applies to the number of tunnels necessary in
   various  devices in the network. In a PE-based VPN, edge-to-edge
   tunnels (PE-to-PE)  need to be established, while in a CE-based VPN,
   end-to-end tunnels between  pairs of CEs are necessary. Therefore,
   fewer tunnels need to be maintained  in a PE-based solution and
   scalability could be improved over that of  CE-based VPNs. The other
   tradeoff is that in a PE-based solution, the CE     is simple at the
   expense of complex PE devices, while on the other hand, in  a CE-
   based solution, the PE devices remain simple while the CE devices are
   more complex.

   A scalable PE-based solution should quantify the amount of state that
   a PE  and P router must support. This should be stated in terms of
   the total  number of VPNs and site interfaces supported by the
   service provider.  Ideally, all VPN-specific state should be
   contained in the PE router, since  routing and/or configuration
   information depends only on the VPNs whose  site(s) are connected to
   that PE. However, this should be balanced against  the requirements
   of specific services, such as multicast, which may require  per VPN
   state in the P router.

5.2. Management

   A service provider must have a means to view the topology,
   operational state, order status, and other parameters associated with
   each customer's VPN. Furthermore, the service provider must have a
   means to view the underlying logical and physical topology,
   operational state, provisioning status, and other parameters
   associated with the equipment providing the VPN service(s) to its
   customers.

   VPN devices should provide standards-based management interfaces
   wherever feasible.

   Service Provider Network Management System (NMS) requirements mainly
   fall in the traditional fault, configuration, accounting,
   performance, and security (FCAPS) management categories. These
   requirements are available in detail in [Y.1311.1].



6. Engineering requirements

   These requirements are driven by implementation characteristics that
   make service and provider requirements  achievable.


6.1. Forwarding plane requirements

   VPN solutions should not preclude any currently defined tunneling
   techniques, and should also be easily adaptable to any tunneling
   technique that will be developed in the future. The separation of VPN
   solution and tunnels will facilitate providing different levels of
   services.

   For Layer 2 VPNs, solutions should utilize the pseudo-wires defined
   by PWE3, and should not impose any new requirements. For instance, if
   Control Word is optional for Ethernet, VPN solution can not require
   the control word to be mandatory.

   PPVPN solutions must not impose any restrictions on the backbone
   traffic engineering and management techniques.  Conversely, backbone
   engineering and management techniques must not affect the basic
   operation of a PPVPN, apart from impacting the SLA/SLS guarantees
   associated with the service.

   The VPN traffic should be segregated in the network. After all, VPNs
   are a means of dividing a physical network into several logical
   (virtual) networks. VPN traffic separation should be done in a



                                                               [Page 15]





Internet Draft draft-nagarajan-ppvpn-generic-reqts-00.txt    March, 2003


   scalable fashion. However, safeguards should be made available
   against misbehaving VPNs to not affect the network and other VPNs.

   VPN solution should not impose any hard limit on the number of VPNs
   provided in the network.



6.2.  Control plane requirements

   The plug and play feature of a VPN solution with minimum
   configuration requirements is an important consideration.

   A VPN should be provisioned with minimum number of steps. For
   instance, a VPN need not be configured in every PE. For this to be
   accomplished, an auto-configuration and an auto-discovery protocol,
   which should be common to all VPN solutions, should be defined.
   However, these mechanisms should not affect the cost, scalability or
   stability of a service by being overly complex, or by increasing
   layers in the protocol stack.


6.3. Control Plane Containment

   The PPVPN control plane must include a mechanism through which the
   service provider can filter PPVPN related control plane information
   as it passes between Autonomous Systems. For example, if a service
   provider supports a PPVPN offering, but the service provider's
   neighbors do not participate in that offering, the service provider
   should not leak PPVPN control information into neighboring networks.
   Neighboring networks must be equipped with mechanisms that filter
   this information should the service provider leak it.


6.4. Requirements related to commonality with generic Internet
   mechanisms

   As far as possible, the mechanisms used to establish a VPN service
   should re-use well-known IETF protocols as far as possible, limiting
   the need to define new protocols from scratch.  For example, IETF
   routing protocols should be used for routing of PPVPN traffic, and L2
   bridging technologies should be used in VPNs offering L2 services .
   Discovery may be achieved using discovery functionality in routing
   protocols or mechanisms such as DNS. It should, however, be noted
   that the use of IETF mechanisms for the establishment and running of
   an Internet-based VPN service, shall not affect the stability,
   robustness, and scalability of the Internet or Internet services. A
   solution must be implementable without requiring to add additional



                                                               [Page 16]





Internet Draft draft-nagarajan-ppvpn-generic-reqts-00.txt    March, 2003


   funcionality to the devices in a network.



6.5. Interoperability

   Each technical solution should support the Internet standards (in
   terms of compatibility and modularity).

   Multi-vendor interoperability at network element, network and service
   levels among different implementations of the same technical solution
   should be guaranteed (that will likely rely on the completeness of
   the corresponding standard). This is a central requirement for SPs
   and customers.

   The technical solution must be multi-vendor interoperable not only
   within the SP network infrastructure, but also with the customer's
   network equipment and services making usage of the PPVPN service.

   Customer access connections to a PPVPN solution may be different at
   different sites (e.g., Frame Relay on one site and Ethernet on
   another)

   Interconnection of a L2VPN to a L3VPN as if it were a customer site
   shall be supported.

   Inter-domain interoperability -It should be possible to deploy a
   PPVPN solution  across domains, Autonomous Systems, or the Internet.
