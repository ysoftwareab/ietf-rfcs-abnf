               6TiSCH 6top Scheduling Function Zero (SF0)
                    draft-dujovne-6tisch-6top-sf0-00

Abstract

   This document defines a 6top Scheduling Function called "Scheduling
   Function Zero" (SF0).  SF0 dynamically adapts the number of reserved
   cells between neighbor nodes, based on the specific application's
   bandwidth requirements and the network condition.  Neighbor nodes
   negotiate in a distributed neighbor-to-neighbor basis the cell(s) to
   be added/deleted.  SF0 uses the 6P signaling messages to add/delete
   cells in the schedule.  Some basic rules for deciding when to add/
   delete cells and for selecting the cells to be added/deleted within
   the schedule are also provided.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft               6tisch-6top-sf0                October 2015


   This document addresses the requirements for a scheduling function
   listed in [I-D.wang-6tisch-6top-sublayer], Section 4.2, and follows
   the recommended outline from Section 4.3.

2.  Scheduling Function Identifier

   The Scheduling Function Identifier (SFID) of SF0 is IANA_SFID_SF0.

3.  Rules for Adding/Deleting Cells

   A node running SF0 determines when to add/delete cells in a three-
   step process:

   1.  It waits for a triggering event (Section 3.1).
   2.  It applies the Bandwidth Estimation Algorithm for a particular
       neighbor to determine how many cells are required to that
       neighbor (Section 3.2).
   3.  It applies the Allocation Policy to compare the number of
       required cells to the number of already scheduled cells, and
       determine the number of cells to add/delete (Section 3.3).

3.1.  SF0 Triggering Events

   We RECOMMEND SF0 to monitor the bandwidth usage on the node (local
   node bandwidth) and bandwidth requests from neighbour nodes (incoming
   bandwidth).  This allows SF0 to be triggered by any change in local
   node bandwidth and/or incoming bandwidth.  The exact mechanism of
   when SF0 is triggered is implementation-specific.

3.2.  SF0 Bandwidth Estimation Algorithm

   The Bandwidth Estimation Algorithm takes into account the sum of the
   incoming bandwidth requirements from the neighbour nodes and the
   local bandwidth requirements.  This allows the node to calculate the
   total outcoming bandwidth requirement.  As a consequence, the
   Bandwidth Estimation Algorithm for SF0 follows the steps described
   below:

   1.  Collect the Incoming Bandwidth Requirements from neighbour nodes
       (IBR).
   2.  Collect the Local node Bandwidth Requirements (LBR).
   3.  Calculate the updated total Outgoing Bandwidth Requirement (OBR)
       as: OBR=LBR+IBR and submit the request to the allocation policy.
   4.  Return to step 1.

3.3.  SF0 Allocation Policy

   The "Allocation Policy" is the set of rules used by SF0 to decide
   when to add/delete cells to a particular neighbor to satisfy the
   bandwidth requirements.

   SF0 uses the following parameters:

   SCHEDULEDCELLS:  The number of cells scheduled from the current cell
      to a particular neighbor.
   REQUIREDCELLS:  The number of cells calculated by the Bandwidth
      Estimation Algorithm from the current node to that neighbor.
   SF0THRESH:  Threshold parameter introducing cell over-provisioning in
      the allocation policy.  It is a non-negative value expressed as
      number of cells.  The definition of this value is implementation-
      specific; however, it is RECOMMENDED a SF0THRESH value of 3 cells.
      A setting of SF0THRESH>0 will cause the node to allocate at least
      SF0THRESH cells to each of its' neighbours.

   The SF0 allocation policy compares REQUIREDCELLS with SCHEDULEDCELLS
   and decides to add/delete cells taking into account SF0THRESH.  This
   is illustrated in Figure 1.

   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+   CELLS

   1.  If REQUIREDCELLS<(SCHEDULEDCELLS-SF0THRESH), delete one or more
       cells.
   2.  If (SCHEDULEDCELLS-SF0THRESH)<=REQUIREDCELLS<=SCHEDULEDCELLS, do
       nothing.
   3.  If SCHEDULEDCELLS<=REQUIREDCELLS, add one or more cells.

   When SF0THRESH equals 0, any discrepancy between REQUIREDCELLS and
   SCHEDULEDCELLS triggers an action to add/delete cells.  Positive
   values of SF0THRESH reduce the number of 6P Transactions.

4.  Rules for CellList

   When issuing a 6top ADD Request, SF0 executes the following sequence:

      The Transaction Source node, for each of the cells to be put in
      the CellList field, first selects the slotOffset randomly; second,
      it verifies if the slotOffset is free and third it chooses the
      channelOffset randomly.
      The Transaction Destination node goes through the cells in the
      CellList in order.  For each one, it verifies whether it has a
      cell schedule with the same slotOffset.  If yes, it skips the
      cell.  If not, it allocates the cell.  This stops when either (1)
      it has scheduled NumCells cells or (2) there are no more cells in
      the CellList.

5.  6P Timeout Value

   The 6P Timeout Value provided by SF0 allows the maximum number of
   TSCH link-layer retries.  Given the TSCH parameters for the backoff
   mechanism, macMinBE and macMaxBE, and the length in seconds of the
   minimal Slotframe, SM, the timeout value is computed as: timeout =
   (2^(macMaxBE+1)-2^macMinBE) * SM

6.  Meaning of Container Field

   TODO: length of the SlotFrame SHOULD be an integer multiple of the
   length of the minimal SlotFrame.

7.  Node Behavior at Boot

   In order to define a known state after the node is restarted, a CLEAR
   command is issued to each of the neighbour nodes to enable a new
   allocation process.

Internet-Draft               6tisch-6top-sf0                October 2015


8.  Relocating Cells

   SF0 uses Packet Delivery Rate (PDR) statistics to monitor the
   currently allocated cells for cell re-allocation (by changing their
   slotOffset and/or channelOffset) when it finds out that the PDR of
   one or more softcells is much lower than average.

9.  6P Error Handling

   A node implementing SF0 handles a 6P Response depending on the Return
   Code it contains:

   RC_SUCCESS:
      If the number of elements in the CellList is the number of cells
      specified in the NumCells field of the 6P ALL Request, the
      operation is complete.  The node does not take further action.
      If the number of elements in the CellList is smaller (possibly 0)
      than the number of cells specified in the NumCells field of the 6P
      ALL Request, the neighbor has received the request, but less than
      NumCells of the cells in the CellList were.  In that case, the
      node MAY retry immediately with a different CellList if the amount
      of storage space permits, or build a new (random) CellList.
   RC_ERR_VER:  The node MUST NOT retry immediately.  The node MAY add
      the neighbor node on a blacklist.  The node MAY retry to contact
      this neighbor later.
   RC_ERR_6OFID:  The node MUST NOT retry immediately.  The node MAY add
      the neighbor node on a blacklist.  The node MAY retry to contact
      this neighbor later.
   RC_ERR_NORESOURCES:  Wait for a timeout and restart the scheduling
      process.
   RC_ERR_BUSY:  Issue a RESET command.

11.  Implementation Status

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC6982].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their

   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [RFC6982], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

   OpenWSN:  This specification is implemented in the OpenWSN project
      [OpenWSN].  The authors of this document are collaborating with
      the OpenWSN community to gather feedback about the status and
      performance of the protocols described in this document.  Results
      from that discussion will appear in this section in future
      revision of this specification.
