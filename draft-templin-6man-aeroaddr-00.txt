Abstract

   IPv6 interfaces are required to have a link-local address that is
   unique on the link.  Nodes normally derive a link local address
   through the use of IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)
   along with Duplicate Address Detection (DAD).  This document presents
   a method for a node to construct a link-local address that is assured
   to be unique on the link when the node has already received a
   delegated prefix.  This is through the construction of a link-local
   address format known as the AERO address.

1.  Introduction

   IPv6 interfaces are required to have a link-local address that is
   unique on the link [RFC2460][RFC4861].  Nodes normally derive a link
   local address through the use of IPv6 StateLess Address Auto
   Configuration (SLAAC) along with Duplicate Address Detection (DAD)
   [RFC4862].  This document presents a method for a node to construct a
   link-local address that is assured to be unique on the link when the
   node has already received a delegated prefix.  This is through the
   construction of a link-local address format known as the AERO
   address.

2.  Terminology

   The terminology in the normative references applies.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].  Lower case
   uses of these words are not to be interpreted as carrying RFC2119
   significance.

3.  The AERO Address

   An AERO address is an IPv6 link-local address with an interface
   identifier based on a prefix that has been delegated to a node for
   its own exclusive use.  AERO addresses begin with the prefix
   fe80::/64 and include in the interface identifier (i.e., the lower 64

   bits) a 64-bit prefix taken from one of the node's delegated
   prefixes.  For example, if the node receives the IPv6 prefix:

      2001:db8:1000:2000::/64

   it constructs its corresponding AERO addresses as:

      fe80::2001:db8:1000:2000

   After constructing the AERO address, the node can assign the address
   to the interface over which it received the prefix delegation.  Since
   the prefix delegation is already known to be unique, the node need
   not use Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) to test the AERO address
   for uniqueness since no other node on the link will configure the
   same address.

   AERO addresses can be constructed for any IPv6 prefix that is no
   longer than /64.  For prefixes shorter than /64, the AERO address is
   constructed based on the lowest-numbered /64 prefix taken from the
   shorter prefix.  For example, if the node received the IPv6 prefix:

      2001:db8:1000:2000::/56

   it constructs its corresponding AERO addresses as:

      fe80::2001:db8:1000:2000

4.  Intended Use Cases

   The AERO address is intended for use by mobile networks that comprise
   a mobile router and a tethered network of "Internet of Things"
   devices that travel together with the router as a single unit.  The
   mobile router assigns the AERO address to its upstream interface over
   which it receives a prefix delegation from a delegating router.  The
   manner for receiving the delegated prefix could be through static
   configuration or some automated prefix delegation service.

   Many other use case scenarios are possible (e.g., home networks) but
   the above case extends to multitudes of applications, e.g., a cell
   phone and its associated devices, an airplane and its on-board
   network, etc.

5.  Implementation Status

   Public domain implementations exist that use the AERO address format
   as described in this document.
