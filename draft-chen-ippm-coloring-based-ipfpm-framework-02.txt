1.  Introduction

   Performance Measurement (PM) is an important tool for service
   provider for Service Level Agreement (SLA) verification,
   troubleshooting (e.g., fault localization or fault delimitation) and
   network visualization.  There are two class of measurement methods -

   active measurement method and passive measurement method.  Active
   method measures the performance or reliability parameter associated
   with the transfer of traffic by generating and/or receiving packets
   injected into the network.  On the contrary, passive method measures
   some performance or reliability parameter associated with the
   existing traffic (packets) on the network.  Both passive and active
   methods have their strengths and should be regarded as complementary.
   There are certain scenarios where active measurements alone is not
   enough or applicable and passive measurements are
   desirable[I-D.deng-ippm-passive-wireless-usecase].

   With active measurement method, the rate, numbers and interval
   between the injected packets may affect the accuracy of the results.
   And for injected test packets it may not be guaranteed to always be
   in-band with the data traffic in the pure IP network due to Equal
   Cost Multi-Path (ECMP).

   The Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) PM protocol [RFC6374] for
   packet loss is an example of passive performance measurement.  By
   periodically inserting auxiliary Operations, Administration and
   Maintenance (OAM) packets, the traffic is delimited by the OAM
   packets into consecutive blocks, and the receivers count the packets
   and calculate the packets loss each block.  However, solutions like
   [RFC6374] depend on the fixed positions of the delimiting OAM packets
   for packets counting, and thus are vulnerable to out-of-order arrival
   of packets.  This could happen particularly with out-of-band OAM
   channels, but might also happen with in-band OAM because of the
   presence of multipath forwarding within the network.  Out of order
   delivery of data and the delimiting OAM can give rise to inaccuracies
   in the performance measurement figures.  The scale of these
   inaccuracies will depend on data speeds and the variation in
   delivery, but with out-of-band OAM, this could result in significant
   differences between real and reported performance.

   This document specifies a passive measurement method, the IP flow
   performance measurement (IPFPM).  With IPFPM, data packets are marked
   into different blocks of markers by changing one or more bits of
   packets without altering normal processing in the network.  No
   additional delimiting packet is needed and the performance can be
   measured in-service without the insertion of additional traffic.
   Furthermore, because marking based IP performance measurement does
   not require extra OAM packets for traffic delimitation, it can be
   used in situations where there is packets re-ordering.  IP Flow
   Information eXport (IPFIX) [RFC7011] is used for reporting the
   measurement data of IPFPM to a central calculation element for
   performance metrics calculation.  Several new Information Elements of
   IPFIX are defined for IPFPM.  These are described in the companion
   document [draft-chen-ippm-ipfpm-report].

2.  Terminology

   The acronyms used in this document will be listed here.

3.  Overview and Concept

   The concept of marking IP packets for performance measurement is
   described in [I-D.tempia-opsawg-p3m].  Marking of packets in a
   specific IP flow to different markings divides the flows into
   different consecutive blocks.  Packets in a block have same marking
   and consecutive blocks will have different markings.  This enables
   the measuring node to count and calculate packet loss and/or delay
   based for each block of markers without any additional auxiliary OAM
   packets.  The following figure (Figure 1) is an example that
   illustrates the different markings in a single IP flow in alternate 0
   and 1 blocks.

       |  0  Block  |   1  Block |  0  Block  |   1  Block |
        000000000000 111111111111 000000000000 111111111111

                    Figure 1: Packet Marking


   For packet loss measurement, there are two ways to mark packets:
   fixed packet numbers or fixed time period for each block of markers.
   This document considers only fixed time period method.  The sender
   and receiver nodes count the transmitted and received packets/octets
   based on each block of markers.  By counting and comparing the
   transmitted and received packets/octets, the packet loss can be
   detected.

   For packet delay measurement, there are two solutions.  One is
   similar to the packet loss, that it still marks the IP flows to
   different blocks of markers and uses the time of the marking change
   as the reference time for delay calculations.  This solution requires
   that there must not be any out-of-order packets; otherwise, the
   result will not be accurate.  Because it uses the first packet of
   each block of markers for delay measurement, if there is packet
   reordering, the first packet of each block at the sender will be
   probably different from the first packet of the block at the
   receiver.  The alternate way is to periodically mark a single packet
   in the IP flow.  Within a given time period, there is only one packet
   that can be marked.  The sender records the timestamp when the marked
   packet is transmitted, the receiver records the timestamp when
   detecting the marked packet.  With the two timestamps, the packet
   delay can be computed.

Internet-Draft               IPFPM Framework                   July 2014


   A centralized calculation element Measurement Control Point (MCP) is
   introduced in Section 4.2 of this document, to collect the packet
   counts and timestamps from the senders and receivers for metrics
   calculation.  The IP Flow Information eXport (IPFIX) [RFC7011]
   protocol is used for collecting the performance measurement statistic
   information [draft-chen-ippm-ipfpm-report].  For the statistic
   information collected, the MCP has to know exactly what packet pair
   counts (one from the sender and the other is from the receiver) are
   based on the same block of markers and a pair of timestamps (one from
   the sender and the other is from the receiver) are based on the same
   marked packet.  The "Period Number" based solution Section 5 is
   introduced to achieve this.

   For a specific IP flow to be measured, there may be one or more
   upstream and downstream Measurement Agents (MAs)( Section 4.3).  An
   IP flow can be identified by the Source IP (SIP) and Destination IP
   (DIP) addresses, and it may combine the SIP and DIP with any or all
   of the Protocol number, the Source port, the Destination port, and
   the Type of Service (TOS) to identify an IP flow.  For each flow,
   there will be a flow identifier that is unique within a certain
   administrative domain.  To simplify the process description, the
   flows discussed in this document are all unidirectional.  A
   bidirectional flow can be seen as two unidirectional flows.

   IFPFM supports the measurement of Multipoint-to-Multipoint (MP2MP)
   flow, which satisfy all the scenarios that include Point-to-Point
   (P2P), Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP), Multipoint-to-Point (MP2P), and
   MP2MP.  P2P scenario is obvious and can be used anywhere.  P2MP and
   MP2P are very common in mobile backhaul networks.  For example, a
   Cell Site Gateway (CSG) multi-homing to two Radio Network Controller
   (RNC) Site Gateways (RSGs) is a typical network design.  When there
   is a failure, there is a requirement to monitor the flows between the
   CSG and the two RSGs hence to determine whether the fault is in the
   transport network or in the wireless network (typically called "fault
   delimitation").  This is especially useful in the situation where the
   transport network belongs to one service provider and wireless
   network belongs to other service providers.

4.  Reference Model and Functional Components

4.1.  Reference Model

   The reference model of the Passive Performance Measurements Framework
   (PPMF) is introduced in [I-D.zheng-ippm-framework-passive].  It
   describes the main functional components of the passive measurement
   system, and the interactions between the components.  The Measurement
   Agent (MA) of IPFPM is equivalent to the MA of PPMF.  The Measurement
   Control Point (MCP) of IPFPM is the combined function of Controller

   and Collector of PPFM.  IP Flow Information eXport (IPFIX) [RFC7011]
   protocol is used for collecting the performance measurement data on
   the MAs and reported to MCP.  The details are specified in the
   companion document [draft-chen-ippm-ipfpm-report].  The Control
   between MCP and MAs are left for future study.

4.2.  Measurement Control Point

   The Measurement Control Point (MCP) is responsible for collecting the
   measurement data from the Measurement Agents (MAs) and calculating
   the performance metrics according to the collected measurement data.
   For packet loss, based on each block of markers, the difference
   between the total counts received from all upstream MAs and the total
   counts received from all downstream MAs are the lost packet numbers.
   The MCP must make sure that the counts from the upstream MAs and
   downstream MAs are related to the same marking/packets block.  For
   packet delay (e.g., one way delay), the difference between the
   timestamps from the downstream MA and upstream MA is the packet
   delay.  Similarly to packet loss, the MCP must make sure the two
   timestamps are based on the same marked packet.  This document
   introduces a Period Number (PN) based synchronization mechanism which
   is discussed in details in Section 5.

4.3.  Measurement Agent

   The Measurement Agent (MA) executes the measurement actions (e.g.,
   marks the packets, counts the packets, records the timestamps, etc.),
   and reports the data to the Measurement Control Point (MCP).  Each MA
   maintains two timers, one (C-timer, used at upstream MA) is for
   marking change, the other (R-timer, used at downstream MA) is for
   reading the packet counts and timestamps.  The two timers have the
   same time interval but are started at different time.  A MA can be
   either an upstream or a downstream MA: the role is specific to an IP
   flow to be measured.  For a specific IP flow, the upstream MA will
   change the marking and read the packet counts and timestamps when the
   C-timer expires, the downstream MA just reads the packets counts and
   timestamps when the R-timer expires.  The MA may delay the reading

Internet-Draft               IPFPM Framework                   July 2014


   for certain time when R-timer expires, in order to tolerant certain
   degree of packet re-ordering.  Section 6 describes this in details.

   For each Measurement Task (corresponding to an IP flow)
   [I-D.zheng-ippm-framework-passive], a MA maintains a pairs of packet
   counters and a timestamp counter for each block of markers.  As for
   the pair of packet counters, one is for counting packets and the
   other is for counting octets.

5.  Period Number

   When data are collected on the upstream MA and downstream MA, e.g.
   packet counts or timestamps, and periodically reported to the MCP,
   certain synchronization mechanism is required to ensure the data
   collected are correlated.  This document introduces the Period Number
   (PN) to help the MCP to determine whether any two or more packet
   counts (from distributed MAs) are related to the same block of
   markers or any two timestamps are related to the same marked packet.

   Period Number assures the data correlation by literally split the
   packets into different measurement period.  The PN is generated each
   time a MA reads the packet counts or timestamps, and is associated
   with Each packet count and timestamp reported to the MCP.  When the
   MCP see e.g.  two PN associated with two packet counts from a
   upstream and downstream MA, it consider this two packet counts are
   for the same measurement period by the same PN, i.e. this two packet
   counts are related to the same block of markers.  The assumption is
   that the upstream and downstream MAs are time synchronized.  This
   requires that the upstream and downstream MAs having a certain time
   synchronization capability (e.g., supporting the Network Time
   Protocol (NTP) [RFC5905], or the IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol
   (PTP) [IEEE1588].)  The PN is calculated as the modulo of the local
   time (when the counts or timestamps are read) and the interval of the
   marking time period.

6.  Re-ordering Tolerance

   In order to allow for a certain degree of packets re-ordering, the
   R-timer on downstream MA should be started delta-t (&#916;t) later
   after the C-timer is started.  Delta-t is a defined period of time
   and should satisfies the following conditions:

   (Time-L - Time-MRO ) < &#916;t < (Time-L + Time-MRO )

   Where

   Time-L: the link delay time between the sender and receiver;




Chen, et al.             Expires January 4, 2015                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft               IPFPM Framework                   July 2014


   Time-MRO: the maximum re-ordering time difference; if a packet is
   expected to arrive at t1 but actually arrives at t2, then the Time-
   MRO = | t2 - t1|.

   So, the R-timer should be started at "t + &#916;t" (where the t is
   the time when C-timer started).

   For simplicity, the C-timer should be started at the beginning of
   each time period.  This document recommends the implementation to
   support at least these time periods (1s, 10s, 1min, 10min and 1h).
   So, if the time period is 10s, the C-timer should be started at the
   time of any multiples of 10 in seconds (e.g., 0s, 10s, 20s, etc.),
   then the R-timer should be started (e.g., 0s+&#916;t, 10s+&#916;t,
   20s+&#916;t, etc.).  With this method, each MA can independently
   start its C-timer and R-timer given that the clocks have been
   synchronized.

7.  Packet Loss Measurement

   To simplify the process description, the flows discussed in this
   document are all unidirectional.  A bidirectional flow can be seen as
   two unidirectional flows.  For a specific flow, there will be
   upstream and downstream MAs and upstream and downstream packet
   counts/timestamp accordingly.

   For packet loss measurement, this document defines the following
   counters and quantities:

   U-CountP[n][m]: U-CountP is a two-dimensional array that stores the
   number of packets transmitted by each upstream MA in each marking
   time period.  Specifically, parameter "n" is the "period number" of
   measured blocks of markers while parameter "m" refers to the m-th MA
   of the upstream MAs.

   D-CountP[n][m]: D-CountP is a two-dimensional array that stores the
   number of packets received by each downstream MA in each marking time
   period.  Specifically, parameter "n" is the "period number" of
   measured blocks of markers while parameter "m" refers to the m-th MA
   of the downstream MAs.

   U-CountO[n][m]: U-CountO is a two-dimensional array that stores the
   number of octets transmitted by each upstream MA in each marking time
   period.  Specifically, parameter "n" is the "period number" of
   measured blocks of markers while parameter "m" refers to the m-th MA
   of the upstream MAs.

   D-CountO[n][m]: D-CountO is a two-dimensional array that stores the
   number of octets received by each downstream MA in each marking time

Internet-Draft               IPFPM Framework                   July 2014


   period.  Specifically, parameter "n" is the "period number" of
   measured blocks of markers while parameter "m" refers to the m-th MA
   of the downstream MAs.

   LossP: the number of packets transmitted by the upstream MAs but not
   received at the downstream MAs.

   LossO: the total octets transmitted by the upstream MAs but not
   received at the downstream MAs.

   The total packet loss of a flow can be computed as follows:

   LossP = U-CountP[1][1] + U-CountP[1][2] + .... + U-CountP[n][m] -
   D-CountP[1][1] - D-CountP[1][2] - .... - D-CountP[n][m'].

   LossO = U-CountO[1][1] + U-CountO[1][2] + .... + U-CountO[n][m] -
   D-CountO[1][1] - D-CountO[1][2] - .... - D-CountO[n][m'].

   Where the m and m' are the number of upstream MAs and downstream MAs,
   respectively.

8.  Packet Delay Measurement

   For packet delay measurement, there will be only one upstream MA and
   may be one or more (P2MP) downstream MAs.  Although the marking based
   IPFPM supports P2MP model, this document only discusses P2P model,
   the P2MP model is left for future study.  This document defines the
   following timestamps and quantities:

   U-Time[n]: U-Time is a one-dimension array that stores the time when
   marked packets are sent; parameter "n" is the "period number" of
   marked packets.

   D-Time[n]: D-Time is a one-dimension array that stores the time when
   marked packets are received; parameter "n" is the "period number" of
   marked packets.  This is only for P2P model.

   D-Time[n][m]: D-Time a two-dimension array that stores the time when
   the marked packet is received by downstream MAs at each marking time
   period.  Here, parameter "n" is the "period number" of marked packets
   while parameter "m" refers to the m-th MA of the downstream MAs.
   This is for P2MP model which is left for future study.

   One-way Delay[n]: The one-way delay metric for packet networks is
   described in [RFC2679].  The "n" identifies the "period number" of
   the marked packet.

   One-way Delay[1] = D-Time[1] - U-Time[1].

   One-way Delay[2] = D-Time[2] - U-Time[2].

   ...

   One-way Delay[n] = D-Time[n] - U-Time[n].

   In the case of two-way delay, the delay is the sum of the two one-way
   delays of the two flows that have the same MAs but have opposite
   directions.

   Two-way Delay[1] = (D-Time[1] - U-Time[1]) + (D-Time'[1] -
   U-Time'[1]).

   Two-way Delay[2] = (D-Time[2] - U-Time[2]) + (D-Time'[2] -
   U-Time'[2]).

   ...

   Two-way Delay[n] = (D-Time[n] - U-Time[n]) + (D-Time'[n] -
   U-Time'[n]).

   Where the D-Time and U-Time are for one forward flow, the D-Time' and
   U-Time' are for reverse flow.

9.  Consideration on Marking Bits Selection

   This document does not specify which bits should be used for marking;
   it primarily introduces options that the operator can choose for
   packet marking.  This document introduces the following options:

   1.  For IPv4, there is only one bit (the last reserved bit of the
       Flag field of the IPv4 header) in IP header that can be used for
       marking.  With one bit, at any time it can only be used for loss
       or delay measurement and cannot be used for packet loss and delay
       measurement simultaneously;

   2.  For IPv6, it can leverage the IPv6 extension header for marking,
       for example, adding a new option to the Hop-by-Hop Options
       header[RFC2460] for marking.  More detail will be added in a
       future version or in a separate document.

   For the above options, the operators should carefully think of the
   marking bits selection to make sure that the setting or changing of
   the marking bits SHOULD NOT affect the normal packet forwarding and
   process.

   The implementations SHOULD provide knobs for operators to configure
   and change the marking bits according to their network design and
   policies.

10.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request to IANA.

11.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies a passive mechanism for measuring packet loss
   and delay within a Service Provider's network where the IP packets
   are marked with the unused bits in IP head field, and then inserting
   additional OAM packets during the measurement is avoided.  Obviously,
   such mechanism does not directly affect other applications running on
   the Internet but may lead to potential affects to the measurement
   itself.

   First, the measurement itself may be affected by routers (or other
   network devices) along the path of IP packets intentionally altering
   the value of marking bits of packets.  Just as mentioned before, the
   mechanism specified in this document is just in the context of one
   Service Provider's network, so the routers (or other network devices)
   are controllable and thus this kind of attack can be omitted.

   Second, the measurement can be harmed by attackers injecting
   artificial traffic.  Then authentication techniques, like digital
   signatures, may be used to guard against such kind of attack.
