1.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  PING Datagram Format Type

   PING is an HTTP Datagram Format Type
   [I-D.draft-ietf-masque-h3-datagram].  It has no Additional Data.

2.1.  Format

   PING Datagrams have the following format:

   PING {
     Sequence Number (i),
     Opaque Data (..),
   }

                       Figure 1: PING Datagram Format

   All Sequence Number and Opaque Data values are potentially valid.

2.2.  Use

   The sender emits a PING Datagram with any even Sequence Number and
   any Opaque Data.  Upon receiving a PING Datagram with an even
   Sequence Number, the recipient MUST reply with a PING Datagram whose
   Sequence Number is one larger, with empty Opaque Data.

   Intermediaries MUST forward PING Datagrams without modification, just
   like any other HTTP Datagram.

3.  Use cases

   PING Datagrams can be used to characterize the end-to-end HTTP
   Datagram path associated with an HTTP request.  For example, HTTP
   endpoints can easily use PING Datagrams to estimate the round-trip
   time and loss rate of the HTTP Datagram path.

   PING Datagrams are also suitable for use as DPLPMTUD Probe Packets
   [RFC8899].  This enables endpoints to estimate the HTTP Datagram MTU
   of each Datagram path, in order to avoid sending HTTP Datagrams that
   will be dropped.

   Note that these path characteristics can differ from those inferred
   from the underlying transport (e.g.  QUIC), if the HTTP request
   traverses one or more HTTP intermediaries (see Section 3.7 of
   [I-D.draft-ietf-httpbis-semantics]).

4.  IANA considerations

   IANA is directed to add the following entry to the "HTTP Datagram
   Format Types" registry:

   *  Type: PING

   *  Value: TBD

   *  Reference: (This document)
