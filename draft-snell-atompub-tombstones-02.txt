1.  Introduction

   This specification defines mechanisms in the form of Atom Format
   [RFC4287] extensions that Atom Feed publishers can use to explicitly
   indicate that specific Atom Entries have been removed from a feed for
   any reason.


2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119]

   This specification uses XML Namespaces [W3C.REC-xml-names-19990114]
   to uniquely identify XML element names.  It uses the following
   namespace prefix for the indicated namespace URI;

   {Ed.  Note: this namespace MUST be changed to a proper IETF namespace
   scheme prior to publication}

    "at": "http://purl.org/atompub/tombstones/1.0"


3.  The 'deleted-entry' element

   The 'deleted-entry' element MAY appear as a child of atom:feed to
   represent an Atom Entry that has been removed from the feed.

     deletedEntry = element at:deleted-entry {
       atomCommonAttributes,
       ( & atomID,
         & when { atomDateConstruct },
         & by?,
         & comment?,
         & undefinedContent )
     }

     when = element at:when { atomDateConstruct }
     by = element at:by { atomPersonConstruct }
     comment = element at:comment { atomTextConstruct }


   The 'deleted-entry' element MUST contain one 'atom:id' element whose
   value specifies the atom:id of the deleted entry.

   The 'deleted-entry' element MUST contain one 'when' element whose
   value is an [RFC3339] "date-time" specifying the instant the entry

   was deleted.  An uppercase "T" character MUST be used to separate
   date and time, and an uppercase "Z" character MUST be present in the
   absence of a numeric time zone offset

   The 'deleted-entry' element MAY contain one 'by' element used to
   identify the entity that removed the entry from the feed.

   The 'deleted-entry' element MAY contain one 'comment' element whose
   value provides additional information about the deletion operation.
   The 'comment' element is Language-Sensitive as specified by
   [RFC4287].

   Atom Feed Documents MAY contain any number of 'deleted-entry'
   elements.

     <feed xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom">
        ...
        <at:deleted-entry>
          <atom:id>tag:example.org,2005:/entries/1</atom:id>
          <at:when>2005-11-29T12:12:12Z</at:when>
          <at:by>
            <name>John Doe</name>
            <email>jdoe@example.org</email>
          </at:by>
          <at:comment>Removed comment spam</at:comment>
        </at:deleted-entry>
        <at:deleted-entry>
          <atom:id>tag:example.org,2005:/entries/2</atom:id>
          <at:when>2005-11-29T12:11:12Z</at:when>
          <at:by>
            <name>John Doe</name>
            <email>jdoe@example.org</email>
          </at:by>
          <at:comment>Removed comment spam</at:comment>
        </at:deleted-entry>
        ...
     </feed>

   An Atom feed MAY contain atom:entry elements and 'deleted-entry'
   elements sharing the same atom:id value.  Atom processors MUST ignore
   any 'deleted-entry' elements sharing an atom:id value with an atom:
   entry whose 'updated' element specifies a date and time more recent
   than the 'deleted-entry' element's 'when' value.


4.  Security Considerations

   As specified in [RFC4287], Atom processors should be aware of the

   potential for spoofing attacks where an attacked publishes atom:entry
   elements with the same atom:id value of entries from other Atom
   feeds.  The same potential exists with the mechanisms defined here in
   that an attacker may attempt to spoof an application into believing
   that a given entry has been removed from a feed.  To mitigate this
   issue, Atom processors are advised to ignore 'deleted-entry' elements
   referencing entries that have not previously appeared within the
   containing Feed document and should take steps to verify the origin
   of the Atom feed before considering the entries to be removed.


5.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations introduced by this specification.
