Abstract

   The Internet's Domain Name System (DNS) is built upon the foundation
   provided by the Root Server System -- that is, the critical
   infrastructure that serves the DNS root zone.

   Yeti DNS is an experimental, non-production testbed that aims to
   provide an environment where technical and operational experiments
   can safely be performed without risk to production infrastructure.
   This testbed has been used by a broad community of participants to
   perform experiments that aim to inform operations and future
   development of the production DNS.  Yeti DNS is an independently-
   coordinated project and is not affiliated with ICANN, IANA or any
   Root Server Operator.

   The Yeti DNS testbed implementation includes various novel and
   experimental components including IPv6-only transport, independent,
   autonomous Zone Signing Key management, large cryptographic keys and
   a large number of component Yeti-Root Servers.  These differences
   from the Root Server System have operational consequences such as
   large responses to priming queries and the coordination of a large
   pool of independent operators; by deploying such a system globally
   but outside the production DNS system, the Yeti DNS project provides
   an opportunity to gain insight into those consequences without
   threatening the stability of the DNS.

   This document neither addresses the relevant policies under which the
   Root Server System is operated nor makes any proposal for changing
   any aspect of its implementation or operation.  This document aims
   solely to document technical and operational findings following the
   deployment of a system which is similar but different from the Root
   Server System.

1.  Introduction

   The Domain Name System (DNS), as originally specified in [RFC1034]
   and [RFC1035], has proved to be an enduring and important platform
   upon which almost every user of Internet services relies.  Despite
   its longevity, extensions to the protocol, new implementations and
   refinements to DNS operations continue to emerge both inside and
   outside the IETF.

   The Root Server System in particular has seen technical innovation
   and development in recent years, for example in the form of wide-
   scale anycast deployment, the mitigation of unwanted traffic on a
   global scale, the widespread deployment of Response Rate Limiting
   [RRL], the introduction of IPv6 transport, the deployment of DNSSEC,
   changes in DNSSEC key sizes and preparations to roll the root zone's
   trust anchor.  Together, even the projects listed in this brief
   summary imply tremendous operational change, all the more impressive
   when considered the necessary caution when managing Internet critical
   infrastructure, and the context of the adjacent administrative
   changes involved in root zone management and the (relatively
   speaking) massive increase in the the number of delegations in the
   root zone itself.

   Aspects of the operational structure of the Root Server System have
   been described in such documents as [TNO2009], [ISC-TN-2003-1],
   [RSSAC001] and [RFC7720].  Such references, considered together,

   provide sufficient insight into the operations of the system as a
   whole that it is straightforward to imagine structural changes to the
   root server system's infrastructure, and to wonder what the
   operational implications of such changes might be.

   The Yeti DNS Project was conceived in May 2015 to provide a captive,
   non-production testbed upon which the technical community could
   propose and run experiments designed to answer these kinds of
   questions.  Coordination for the project was provided by TISF, the
   WIDE Project and the Beijing Internet Institute.  Many volunteers
   collaborated to build a distributed testbed that at the time of
   writing includes 25 Yeti root servers with 16 operators and handles
   experimental traffic from individual volunteers, universities, DNS
   vendors and distributed measurement networks.

   By design, the Yeti testbed system serves the root zone published by
   the IANA with only those structural modifications necessary to ensure
   that it is able to function usefully in the Yeti testbed system
   instead of the production Root Server system.  In particular, no
   delegation for any top-level zone is changed, added or removed from
   the IANA-published root zone to construct the root zone served by the
   Yeti testbed system.  In this document, for clarity, we refer to the
   zone derived from the IANA-published root zone as the Yeti-Root zone.

   The Yeti DNS testbed serves a similar function to the Root Server
   System in the sense that they both serve similar zones (the Yeti-Root
   zone and the Root zone, respectively).  However, the Yeti DNS testbed
   only serves clients that are explicitly configured to participate in
   the experiment, whereas the Root Server System serves the whole
   Internet.  The known set of clients has allowed structural changes to
   be deployed in the Yeti DNS testbed whose impact on clients can be
   measured and analysed.

2.  Areas of Study

   Examples of topics that the Yeti DNS Testbed was built to address are
   included below, each illustrated with indicative questions.

2.1.  Implementation of a Root Server System-like Testbed

   o  How can a captive testbed be constructed and deployed on the
      Internet, allowing useful public participation without any risk of
      disruption of the Root Server System?

   o  How can representative traffic be introduced into such a captive
      testbed such that insights into the impact of specific differences
      between the testbed and the Root Server System can be observed?

2.2.  Yeti-Root Zone Distribution

   o  What are the scaling properties of Yeti-Root zone distribution as
      the number of Yeti-Root servers, Yeti-Root server instances or
      intermediate distribution points increase?

2.3.  Yeti-Root Server Names and Addressing

   o  What naming schemes other than those closely analogous to the use
      of ROOT-SERVERS.NET in the production root zone are practical, and
      what are their respective advantages and disadvantages?

   o  What are the risks and benefits of signing the zone that contains
      the names of the Yeti-Root servers?

   o  What automatic mechanisms might be useful to improve the rate at
      which clients of Yeti-Root servers are able to react to a Yeti-
      Root server renumbering event?

2.4.  IPv6-Only Yeti-Root Servers

   o  Are there negative operational effects in the use of IPv6-only
      Yeti-Root servers, compared to the use of servers that are dual-
      stack?

   o  What effect does the IPv6 fragmentation model have on the
      operation of Yeti-Root servers, compared with that of IPv4?

2.5.  DNSSEC in the Yeti-Root Zone

   o  Is it practical to sign the Yeti-Root zone using multiple,
      independently-operated DNSSEC signers and multiple corresponding
      ZSKs?

   o  To what extent is [RFC5011] supported by resolvers?

   o  Does the KSK Rollover plan designed and in the process of being
      implemented by ICANN work as expected on the Yeti testbed?

   o  What is the operational impact of using much larger RSA key sizes
      in the ZSKs used in the Yeti-Root?

   o  What are the operational consequences of choosing DNSSEC
      algorithms other than RSA to sign the Yeti-Root zone?

3.  Yeti DNS Testbed Infrastructure

   The purpose of the testbed is to allow DNS queries from stub
   resolvers, mediated by recursive resolvers, to be delivered to Yeti-
   Root servers, and for corresponding responses generated on the Yeti-
   Root servers to be returned, as illustrated in Figure 1.

          |  appropriate      |  Yeti-Root hints;  |  Yeti-Root zone
          `- resolver         `- Yeti-Root trust   `- with DNSKEY RRSet,
             configured          anchor               signed by Yeti-KSK


                  Figure 1: High-Level Testbed Components

   To use the Yeti DNS testbed, a stub resolver must be explicitly
   configured to use recursive resolvers that have themselves been
   configured to use the Yeti-Root servers.  On the resolvers, that
   configuration consists of a list of names and addresses for the Yeti-
   Root servers (often referred to as a "hints file") that replaces the
   normal Internet DNS hints.  Resolvers also need to be configured with
   a DNSSEC trust anchor that corresponds to a KSK used in the Yeti DNS
   Project, in place of the normal trust anchor for the root zone.

   The need for a Yeti-specific trust anchor in the resolver stems from
   the need to make minimal changes to the root zone, as retrieved from
   the IANA, to transform it into the Yeti-Root that can be used in the
   testbed.  Those changes would be properly rejected by any validator
   using an accurate root zone trust anchor as bogus.  Corresponding
   changes are required in the Yeti-Root hints file Appendix A.

   The data flow from IANA to stub resolvers through the Yeti testbed is
   illustrated in Figure 2 and are described in more detail in the
   sections that follow.

3.1.  Root Zone Retrieval

   Since Yeti DNS servers cannot receive DNS NOTIFY [RFC1996] messages
   from the Root Server System, a polling approach is used.  Each Yeti
   Distribution Master (DM) requests the root zone SOA record from a
   nameserver that permits unauthenticated zone transfers of the root
   zone, and performs a zone transfer from that server if the retrieved
   value of SOA.SERIAL is greater than that of the last retrieved zone.

   At the time of writing, unauthenticated zone transfers of the root
   zone are available directly from B-Root, C-Root, F-Root, G-Root and
   K-Root, and from L-Root via the two servers XFR.CJR.DNS.ICANN.ORG and
   XFR.LAX.DNS.ICANN.ORG, as well as via FTP from sites maintained by
   the Root Zone Maintainer and the IANA Functions Operator.  The Yeti
   DNS Testbed retrieves the root zone from using zone transfers from
   F-Root.  The schedule on which F-Root is polled by each Yeti DM is as
   follows:

                  | DM Operator | Time                  |

                  +-------------+-----------------------+

   The Yeti DNS testbed uses multiple DMs, each of which acts
   autonomously and equivalently to its siblings.  Any single DM can act
   to distribute new revisions of the Yeti-Root zone, and is also
   responsible for signing the RRSets that are changed as part of the
   transformation of the Root Zone into the Yeti-Root zone described in
   Section 3.2.  This shared control over the processing and
   distribution of the Yeti-Root zone approximates some of the ideas
   around shared zone control explored in [ITI2014].

3.2.  Transformation of Root Zone to Yeti-Root Zone

   Two distinct approaches have been deployed in the Yeti-DNS Testbed,
   separately, to transform the Root Zone into the Yeti-Root Zone.  At a
   high level both approaches are equivalent in the sense that they
   replace a minimal set of information in the Root Zone with
   corresponding data corresponding to the Yeti DNS Testbed; the
   mechanisms by which the transforms are executed are different,
   however.  Each is discussed in turn in Section 3.2.1 and
   Section 3.2.2, respectively.

   A third approach has also been proposed, but not yet implemented.
   The motivations and changes implied by that approach are also
   described in Section 3.2.3.

3.2.1.  ZSK and KSK Key Sets Shared Between DMs

   The approach described here was the first to be implemented.  It
   features entirely autonomous operation of each DM, but also requires
   secret key material (the private parts of all Yeti-Root KSK and ZSK
   key-pairs) to be distributed and maintained on each DM in a
   coordinated way.

   The Root Zone is transformed as follows to produce the Yeti-Root
   Zone.  This transformation is carried out autonomously on each Yeti
   DNS Project DM.  Each DM carries an authentic copy of the current set
   of Yeti KSK and ZSK key pairs, synchronised between all DMs (see
   Section 3.4).

   1.  SOA.MNAME is set to www.yeti-dns.org.

Internet-Draft              Yeti DNS Testbed                   July 2017


   2.  SOA.RNAME is set to <dm-operator>.yeti-dns.org.  where <dm-
       operator> is currently one of "wide", "bii" or "tisf".

   3.  All DNSKEY, RRSIG and NSEC records are removed.

   4.  The apex NS RRSet is removed, with the corresponding root server
       glue RRSets.

   5.  A Yeti DNSKEY RRSet is added to the apex, comprising the public
       parts of all Yeti KSK and ZSKs.

   6.  A Yeti NS RRSet is added to the apex that includes all Yeti-Root
       servers.

   7.  Glue records (AAAA, since Yeti-Root servers are v6-only) for all
       Yeti-Root servers are added.

   8.  The Yeti-Root Zone is signed: the NSEC chain is regenerated; the
       Yeti KSK is used to sign the DNSKEY RRSet, and the DM's local ZSK
       to generate every other RRSet.

   Note that the SOA.SERIAL value published in the Yeti-Root Zone is
   identical to that found in the Root Zone.

3.2.2.  Unique ZSK per DM; No Shared KSK

   The approach described here was the second to be implemented.  Each
   DM is provisioned with its own, dedicated ZSK key pairs that are not
   shared with other DMs.  A Yeti-Root DNSKEY RRSet is constructed and
   signed upstream of all DMs as the union of the set of active KSKs and
   the set of active ZSKs for every individual DM.  Each DM now only
   requires the secret part of its own dedicated ZSK key pairs to be
   available locally, and no other secret key material is shared.  The
   high-level approach is illustrated in Figure 3.

   The process of retrieving the Root Zone from the Root Server System
   and replacing and signing the apex DNSKEY RRSet no longer takes place
   on the DMs, and instead takes place on a central Hidden Master.  The
   production of signed DNSKEY RRSets is analogous to the use of Signed
   Key Responses (SKR) produced during ICANN KSK key ceremonies.

   Each DM now retrieves source data (with pre-modified and Yeti-signed
   DNSKEY RRset, but otherwise unchanged) from the Yeti DNS Hidden
   Master instead of from the Root Server System.

   Each DM carries out a similar transformation to that described in
   Section 3.2.1, except that DMs no longer need to modify or sign the
   DNSKEY RRSet.

   The Yeti-Root Zone served by any particular Yeti-Root Server will
   include signatures generated using the ZSK from the DM that served
   the Yeti-Root Zone to that Yeti-Root Server.  Signatures cached at
   resolvers might be retrieved from any Yeti-Root Server, and hence are
   expected to be a mixture of signatures generated by different ZSKs.
   Since all ZSKs can be trusted through the signature by the Yeti KSK
   over the DNSKEY RRSet, which includes all ZSKs, the mixture of
   signatures was predicted not to be a threat to reliable validation.
   Deployment and experimentation confirms this to be the case, even
   when individual ZSKs are rolled on different schedules.

   A consequence of this approach is that the apex DNSKEY RRSet in the
   Yeti-Root zone is much larger than the corresponding DNSKEY RRSet in
   the Root Zone.

3.2.3.  Preserving Root Zone NSEC Chain and ZSK RRSIGs

   A change to the transformation described in Section 3.2.2 has been
   proposed that would preserve the NSEC chain from the Root Zone and
   all RRSIG RRs generated using the Root Zone's ZSKs.  The DNSKEY RRSet
   would continue to be modified to replace the Root Zone KSKs, and the
   Yeti KSK would be used to generate replacement signatures over the
   apex DNSKEY and NS RRSets.  Source data would continue to flow from
   the Root Server System through the Hidden Master to the set of DMs,
   but no DNSSEC operations would be required on the DMs and the source
   NSEC and most RRSIGs would remain intact.

   This approach has been suggested in order to provide
   cryptographically-verifiable confidence that no owner name in the
   root zone had been changed in the process of producing the Yeti-Root
   zone from the Root Zone, addressing one of the concerns described in
   Appendix B in a way that can be verified automatically.

3.3.  Yeti-Root Zone Distribution

   Each Yeti DM is configured with a full list of Yeti-Root Server
   addresses to send NOTIFY messages to, and to form the basis for an
   address-based access-control list for zone transfers.  Authentication
   by address could be replaced with more rigourous mechanisms (e.g.
   using Transaction Signatures (TSIG) [RFC2845]); this has not been
   done at the time of writing since the use of address-based controls
   avoid the need for the distribution of shared secrets amongst the
   Yeti-Root Server Operators.

   Individual Yeti-Root Servers are configured with a full set of Yeti
   DM addresses to which SOA and AXFR requests may be sent in the
   conventional manner.

3.4.  Synchronization of Service Metadata

   Changes in the Yeti-DNS Testbed infrastructure such as the addition
   or removal of Yeti-Root servers, renumbering Yeti-Root Servers or
   DNSSEC key rollovers require coordinated changes to take place on all
   DMs.  The Yeti-DNS Testbed is subject to more frequent changes than
   are observed in the Root Server System and includes substantially
   more Yeti-Root Servers than there are Root Servers, and hence a
   manual change process in the Yeti Testbed would be more likely to
   suffer from human error.  An automated process was consequently
   implemented.

   A repository of all service metadata involved in the operation of
   each DM was implemented as a separate git repository hosted at
   github.com, since this provided a simple, transparent and familiar

Internet-Draft              Yeti DNS Testbed                   July 2017


   mechanism for participants to review.  Requests to change the service
   metadata for a DM are submitted as pull requests from a fork of the
   corresponding repository; each DM operator reviews pull requests and
   merges them to indicate approval.  Once merged, changes are pulled
   automatically to individual DMs and promoted to production.

3.5.  Yeti-Root Server Naming Scheme

   The current naming scheme for Root Servers was normalized to use
   single-character host names (A through M) under the domain ROOT-
   SERVERS.NET, as described in [RSSAC023]).  The principal benefit of
   this naming scheme is that DNS label compression can be used to
   produce a priming response that will fit within 512 bytes, the
   maximum DNS message size using UDP transport without EDNS0 [RFC6891].

   Yeti-Root Servers do not use this optimisation, but rather use free-
   form nameserver names chosen by their respective operators -- in
   other words, no attempt is made to minimise the size of the priming
   response through the use of label compression.  This approach aims to
   challenge the need for a minimally-sized priming response in a modern
   DNS ecosystem where EDNS(0) is prevalent.

   Priming responses from Yeti-Root Servers do not always include server
   addresses in the additional section, as is the case with priming
   responses from Root Servers.  In particular, Yeti-Root Servers
   running BIND9 return an empty additional section, forcing resolvers
   to complete the priming process with a set of conventional recursive
   lookups in order to resolve addresses for each Yeti-Root server.
   Yeti-Root Servers running NSD appeared to return a fully-populated
   additional section.

   Various approaches to normalise the composition of the priming
   response were considered, including:

   o  Require use of DNS implementations that exhibit the desired
      behaviour in the priming response (e.g.  NSD) in favour of BIND9;

   o  Modification of BIND9 (and any other server with similar
      behaviour) for use by Yeti-Root Servers;

   o  Isolate the names of Yeti-Root Servers in one or more zones that
      could be slaved on each Yeti-Root Server, renaming servers as
      necessary, giving each a source of authoritative data with which
      the authority section of a priming response could be fully
      populated.  This is the approach used in the Root Server System.

   The potential mitigation of renaming all Yeti-Root Servers using a
   scheme that would allow their names to exist in the balliwick of the



Song, et al.             Expires January 4, 2018               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft              Yeti DNS Testbed                   July 2017


   root zone was not considered, since that approach implies the
   invention of new top-level labels not present in the Root Zone.

   Given the relative infrequency of priming queries by individual
   resolvers and the additional complexity or other compromises implied
   by each of those mitigations, the decision was made to make no effort
   to ensure that the composition of priming responses was identical
   across servers.  Even the empty additional sections generated by
   Yeti-Root Servers running BIND9 seem to be sufficient for all
   resolver software tested; resolvers simply perform a new recursive
   lookup for each authoritative server name they need to resolve.

3.6.  Yeti-Root Servers

   Various volunteers have donated authoritative servers to act as Yeti-
   Root servers.  At the time of writing there are 25 Yeti-Root servers
   distributed globally, one of which is named using an IDNA2008
   [RFC5890] label, shown in the following list in punycode.

   The current list of Yeti-Root server is made available to a
   participating resolver first using a substitute hints file Appendix A
   and subsequently by the usual resolver priming process
   [I-D.ietf-dnsop-resolver-priming].  All Yeti-Root servers are
   IPv6-only, foreshadowing a future IPv6-only Internet, and hence the
   Yeti-Root hints file contains no IPv4 addresses and the Yeti-Root
   zone contains no IPv4 glue.

   At the time of writing, all root servers within the Root Server
   System serve the ROOT-SERVERS.NET zone in addition to the root zone,
   and all but one also serve the ARPA zone.  Yeti-Root servers serve
   the Yeti-Root zone only.

   Significant software diversity exists across the set of Yeti-Root
   servers, as reported by their volunteer operators:

   o  Platform: 20 of 25 Yeti-Root servers are implemented on a VPS
      rather than bare metal.

   o  Operating System: 6 Yeti-Root servers run on on Linux (Ubuntu,
      Debian, CentOS, and ArchLinux); 5 run on FreeBSD and 1 on NetBSD.

   o  DNS software: 18 of 25 Yeti-Root servers use BIND9 (versions
      varying between 9.9.7 and 9.10.3); four use NSD (4.10 and 4.15);
      two use Knot (2.0.1 and 2.1.0) and one uses Bundy (1.2.0).

3.7.  Traffic Capture and Analysis

   Query and response traffic capture is available in the testbed in
   both Yeti resolvers and Yeti-Root servers in anticipation of
   experiments that require packet-level visibility into DNS traffic.

   Traffic capture is performed on Yeti-Root servers using either dnscap
   <https://www.dns-oarc.net/tools/dnscap> or pcapdump (part of the
   pcaputils Debian package <https://packages.debian.org/sid/pcaputils>,
   with a patch to facilitate triggered file upload
   <https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=545985>.  PCAP-
   format files containing packet captures are uploaded using rsync to
   central storage.

4.  Operational Experience with Yeti DNS Testbed

   The following sections provide commentary on the operation of the
   Yeti-DNS Testbed described in Section 3.  More detailed descriptions
   of observed phenomena are available in Yeti DNS mailing list archives
   and on the Yeti DNS blog.

4.1.  Automated Hints File Maintenance

   Renumbering events in the Root Server System are relatively rare.
   Although each such event is accompanied by the publication of an
   updated hints file in standard locations, the task of updating local
   copies of that file used by DNS resolvers is manual, and the process
   has an observably-long tail: for example, in 2015 J-Root was still
   receiving traffic at its old address some thirteen years after
   renumbering [Wessels2015].

   The observed impact of these old, deployed hints file is minimal,
   likely due to the very low frequency of such renumbering events.
   Even the oldest of hints file would still contain some accurate root
   server addresses from which priming responses could be obtained.

Internet-Draft              Yeti DNS Testbed                   July 2017


   By contrast, due to the experimental nature of the system and the
   fact that it is operated mainly by volunteers, Yeti-Root Servers are
   added, removed and renumbered with much greater frequency.  A tool to
   facilitate automatic maintenance of hints files was therefore
   created, [hintUpdate].

   The automated procedure followed by the hintUpdate tool is as
   follows.

   1.  Use the local resolver to obtain a response to the query ./IN/NS;

   2.  Use the local resolver to obtain a set of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
       for each nameserver;

   3.  Validate all signatures obtained from the local resolvers, and
       confirm that all data is signed;

   4.  Compare the data obtained to that contained within the currently-
       active hints file; if there are differences, rotate the old one
       way and replace it with a new one.

   This tool would not function unmodified when used in the Root Server
   System, since the names of individual Root Servers (e.g.  A.ROOT-
   SERVERS.NET) are not signed.  All Yeti-Root Server names are signed,
   however, and hence this tool functions as expected in that
   environment.

4.2.  Fragmentation of DNS Responses

   In the Root Server System, structural changes with the potential to
   increase response sizes (and hence fragmentation, fallback to TCP
   transport or both) have been exercised with great care, since the
   impact on clients has been difficult to predict or measure.  The Yeti
   DNS Testbed is experimental and has the luxury of a known client
   base, making it far easier to make such changes and measure their
   impact.

   Many of the experimental design choices described in this document
   were expected to trigger larger responses.  For example, the choice
   of naming scheme for Yeti-Root Servers described in Section 3.5
   defeats label compression the priming response; the Yeti-Root zone
   transformation approach described in Section 3.2.2 greatly enlarges
   the apex DNSKEY RRSet.  An increased incidence of fragmentation was
   therefore expected.

   XXX Note to reviewers: results of fragmentation and TCP fallback
   measurements to be summarised here XXX

   The Yeti-DNS Testbed provides service on IPv6 only.  IPv6 has a
   fragmentation model that is different from IPv4 -- in particular,
   fragmentation always takes place on a sending end-host, and not on an
   intermediate router.

   Fragmentation may cause serious issues; if a single fragment is lost,
   it results in the loss of the entire datagram of which the fragment
   was a part, and in the DNS frequently triggers a timeout.  It is
   known at this moment that only a limited number of security middle-
   box implementations support IPv6 fragments.

   The consequences of fragmentation were not limited to DNS using UDP
   transpoert.  There are two cases reported where some Yeti root
   servers failed to transfer the Yeti-Root zone from a DM.  Further
   experimentation revealed that combinations of NetBSD 6.1, NetBSD
   7.0RC1, FreeBSD 10.0, Debian 3.2 and VMWare ESXI 5.5 resulted in a
   high TCP MSS value of 1440 octets being negotiated between client and
   server despite the presence of the IPV6_USE_MIN_MTU socket option, as
   described in [I-D.andrews-tcp-and-ipv6-use-minmtu].  The mismatch
   appears to cause outbound segments greater in size than 1280 octets
   to be dropped before sending.

4.3.  Root Label Compression in Knot

   [RFC1035] specifies that domain names can be compressed when encoded
   in DNS messages, being represented as one of

   1.  a sequence of labels ending in a zero octet;

   2.  a pointer; or

   3.  a sequence of labels ending with a pointer.

   The purpose of this flexibility is to reduce the size of domain names
   encoded in DNS messages.

   It was observed that Yeti-Root Servers running knot 2.0 would
   compress the zero-length label (the root domain, often represented as
   ".") using a pointer to an earlier example.  Although legal, this
   encoding increases the encoded size of the root label from one octet
   to two; it was also found to break some client software, in
   particular the Go DNS library.  Bug reports were filed against both
   knot and the Go DNS library, and both were resolved in subsequent
   releases.

4.4.  Increased ZSK Key Size

   The ZSK key size used in the Yeti-DNS Testbed was initially 1024
   bits, consistent with the size of the ZSK used in the Root Zone at
   the time the Yeti DNS Project was started.  It later became clear
   that the ZSK key size in the Root Zone was to be increased.

   The ZSK key size in the Yeti-Root zone was subsequently increased in
   an attempt to identify any unexpected operational effects of doing
   so.

   XXX Note to reviewers: observations following that change to be
   inserted here.  XXX

   The ZSK key size in the Root Zone was increased from 1024 bits to
   2048 bits in October 2016.  [Verisign2016].

4.5.  KSK Rollover

   The Root Zone KSK is expected to undergo a carefully-orchestrated
   rollover as described in [ICANN2016].  ICANN has commissioned various
   tests and has published an external test plan [ICANN2017].

   The planned approach was also modelled in the Yeti-DNS Testbed.

   XXX Note to reviewers: observations about the KSK rollover in the
   Yeti-Root zone to be inserted here.  XXX

Appendix A.  Yeti-Root Hints File

   The following hints file (complete and accurate at the time of
   writing) causes a DNS resolver to use the Yeti DNS testbed in place
   of the production Root Server System and hence participate in
   experiments running on the testbed.

   Note that some lines have been wrapped in the text that follows in
   order to fit within the production constraints of this document.
   Wrapped lines are indicated with a blackslash character ("\"),
   following common convention.

Appendix B.  Controversy

   The Yeti DNS Project, its infrastructure and the various experiments
   that have been carried out using that infrastructure, have been
   described by people involved in the project in many public meetings
   at technical venues since its inception.  The mailing lists using

   which the operation of the infrastructure has been coordinated are
   open to join, and their archives are public.  The project as a whole
   has been the subject of robust public discussion.

   Some commentators have expressed concern that the Yeti DNS Project
   is, in effect, operating an "alternate root," challenging the IAB's
   comments published in [RFC2826].  Other such alternate roots are
   considered to have caused end-user confusion and instability in the
   namespace of the DNS by the introduction of new top-level labels or
   the different use of top-level labels present in the Root Server
   System.  The coordinators of the Yeti DNS Project do not consider the
   Yeti DNS Project to be an alternate root in this sense, since by
   design the namespace enabled by the Yeti-Root Zone is identical to
   that of the Root Zone.

   Some commentators have expressed concern that the Yeti DNS Project
   seeks to influence or subvert administrative policy relating to the
   Root Server System, in particular in the use of DNSSEC trust anchors
   not published by the IANA and the use of Yeti-Root Servers in regions
   where governments or other organisations have expressed interest in
   operating a Root Server.  The coordinators of the Yeti-Root project
   observe that their mandate is entirely technical and has no ambition
   to influence policy directly; they do hope, however, that technical
   findings from the Yeti DNS Project might act as a useful resource for
   the wider technical community.

   Finally, some concern has been expressed about the possible
   applications of the Yeti DNS Project to the governments of countries
   where access to the Internet is subject to substantial centralised
   control, in contrast to most other jurisdictions where such controls
   are either lighter or not present.  The coordinators of the Yeti DNS
   Project have taken care to steer all discussions and related
   decisions about the technical work of the project to public venues in
   the interests of full transparency, and encourage anybody concerned
   about the decision-making process to participate in those venues and
   review their archives directly.

Appendix C.  About This Document

   This section (and sub-sections) has been included as an aid to
   reviewers of this document, and should be removed prior to
   publication.

C.1.  Venue

   The authors propose that this document proceeed as an Independent
   Submission, since it documents work that, although relevant to the
   IETF, has been carried out externally to any IETF working group.

   However, a suitable venue for discussion of this document is the
   dnsop working group.

   particular experiments described in this document can be found at

   Change history is available in the public GitHub repository where
   this document is maintained: <https://github.com/BII-Lab/yeti-
   testbed-experience>.

C.2.2.  draft-song-yeti-testbed-experience-04

   Substantial editorial review and rearrangement of text by Joe Abley
   at request of BII.

   Added what is intended to be a balanced assessment of the controversy
   that has arisen around the Yeti DNS Project, at the request of the
   Independent Submissions Editorial Board.

   Changed the focus of the document from the description of individual
   experiments on a Root-like testbed to the construction and
   motivations of the testbed itself, since that better describes the
   output of the Yeti DNS Project to date.  In the considered opinion of
   this reviewer, the novel approaches taken in the construction of the
   testbed infrastructure and the technical challenges met in doing so
   are useful to record, and the RFC series is a reasonable place to
   record operational experiences related to core Internet
   infrastructure.

   Note that due to draft cut-off deadlines some of the technical
   details described in this revision of the document may not exactly
   match operational reality; however, this revision provides an
   indicative level of detail, focus and flow which it is hoped will be
   helpful to reviewers.
