1  Introduction

   VPLS and PBB-VPLS are widely-deployed L2VPN technologies. Many
   Service Providers (SPs) who are looking at adopting EVPN and PBB-EVPN
   want to preserve their investment in the (PBB-)VPLS networks. Hence,
   they require procedures by which (PBB-)EVPN technology can be
   introduced into their brownfield (PBB-)VPLS networks without
   requiring any upgrades (software or hardware) to these networks. This
   document specifies procedures for the seamless integration of the two
   technologies in the same MPLS/IP network.

   Section 2 provides the details of the requirements. Section 3
   specifies procedures for the seamless integration of PBB-VPLS and
   PBB-EVPN networks. Section 4 specifies procedures for the seamless
   integration of VPLS and EVPN networks. Section 5 specifies procedures
   for the seamless integration of VPLS and PBB-EVPN networks, and
   finally Section 6 discusses the solution advantages.

   It is worth noting that the scenario where PBB-VPLS is integrated
   with EVPN, is not covered in this draft because there hasn't been any
   requirement from service providers for such integration. The reason
   for that is that deployments which employ PBB-VPLS typically require
   PBB encapsulation for various reasons. Hence, it is expected that for
   those deployments the evolution path would be from PBB-VPLS towards
   PBB-EVPN, rather than EVPN.

   VPLS: Virtual Private LAN Service

   Single-Active Redundancy Mode: When only a single PE, among all the
   PEs attached to an Ethernet segment, is allowed to forward traffic
   to/from that Ethernet segment for a given VLAN, then the Ethernet
   segment is defined to be operating in Single-Active redundancy mode.

   All-Active Redundancy Mode: When all PEs attached to an Ethernet
   segment are allowed to forward known unicast traffic to/from that
   Ethernet segment for a given VLAN, then the Ethernet segment is
   defined to be operating in All-Active redundancy mode.


2.  Requirements

   Following are the key requirements for backward compatibility between
   (PBB-)EVPN and (PBB-)VPLS:

   1. The solution MUST allow for staged migration towards (PBB-)EVPN on
   a site-by-site basis per VPN instance - e.g., new EVPN sites to be
   provisioned on (PBB-)EVPN PEs.

   2. The solution MUST require no changes to existing VPLS or PBB-VPLS
   PEs, not even a software upgrade.

   3. The solution MUST allow for the coexistence of PEs running (PBB-
   )EVPN and (PBB-)VPLS for the same VPN instance and single-homed
   segments.

   4. The solution MUST support single-active redundancy of multi-homed
   networks and multi-homed devices for (PBB-)EVPN PEs.

   5. In case of single-active redundancy, the participant VPN instances
   MAY span across both (PBB-)EVPN PEs and (PBB-)VPLS PEs as long as
   single-active redundancy is employed by (PBB-)EVPN PEs. In case of an
   ES link failure, the (PBB-)EVPN PEs will send a BGP mass-withdraw to
   the EVPN peers OR MAC advertisement with MAC Mobility extended
   community for PBB-EVPN AND an LDP MAC withdrawal to the VPLS peers.

   6. The solution SHOULD support All-Active redundancy mode of multi-
   homed networks and multi-homed devices for (PBB-)EVPN PEs. In case of
   All-Active redundancy mode, the participant VPN instances SHOULD be
   confined to (PBB-)EVPN PEs only. 


   These requirements collectively allow for the seamless insertion of
   the (PBB-)EVPN technology into brown-field (PBB-)VPLS deployments.

3 PBB-VPLS Integration with PBB-EVPN

   In order to support seamless integration with (PBB-)VPLS PEs, the
   (PBB-)EVPN PEs MUST support EVPN BGP routes (EVPN SAFI) and VPLS AD
   route (VPLS SAFI). All the logic for this seamless integration SHALL
   reside on the (PBB-)EVPN PEs. However, if a VPLS instance is setup
   without the use of BGP auto-discovery, it is still possible (but
   cumbersome) for (PBB-)EVPN PEs to integrate into that VPLS instance.

3.1 Capability Discovery

   The (PBB-)EVPN PEs MUST advertise both the BGP VPLS auto-discovery
   (AD) route as well as the BGP EVPN Inclusive Multicast route for a
   given VPN instance. The (PBB-)VPLS PEs only advertise the BGP VPLS AD
   route, per current standard procedures specified in [RFC4761] and
   [RFC6074]. The operator may decide to use the same BGP RT to identify
   a VPN on both (PBB-)EVPN and (PBB-)VPLS networks. In this case, when
   a (PBB-)VPLS PE receives the EVPN Inclusive Multicast route, it will
   ignore it on the basis that it belongs to an unknown SAFI. However,
   the operator may choose to use two RTs - one to identify the VPN on
   (PBB-)VPLS network and another for (PBB-)EVPN network and employ RT-
   constraint in order to prevent EVPN BGP routes from reaching the
   (PBB-)VPLS PEs. 

   When a (PBB-)EVPN PE receives both a VPLS AD route as well as an EVPN
   Inclusive Multicast route from a given remote PE for the same VPN
   instance, it MUST give preference to the EVPN route for the purpose
   of discovery. This ensures that, at the end of the route exchanges,
   all (PBB-)EVPN capable PEs discover other (PBB-)EVPN capable PEs in
   addition to the (PBB-)VPLS-only PEs for that VPN instance.
   Furthermore, all the (PBB-)VPLS-only PEs would discover the (PBB-
   )EVPN PEs as if they were standard (PBB-)VPLS PEs. In other words,
   when the discovery phase is complete, the (PBB-)EVPN PEs would have
   discovered all the PEs in the VPN instance along with their
   associated capability: (PBB-)EVPN or VPLS-only. Whereas the (PBB-
   )VPLS PEs would have discovered all the PEs in the VPN instance, as
   if they were all VPLS-only PEs.


3.2 Forwarding Setup and Unicast Operation

   The procedures for forwarding setup and unicast operation on the
   (PBB-)VPLS PE are per [RFC8077] and [RFC7080]. 

   The procedures for forwarding state setup and unicast operation on
   the (PBB-)EVPN PE are as follows:

   - The (PBB-)EVPN PE MUST establish a pseudowire to a remote PE from
 


Sajassi et al.         Expires September 29, 2018               [Page 7]

INTERNET DRAFT  draft-ietf-bess-evpn-vpls-seamless-integ  March 29, 2018


   which it has received only a VPLS AD route for the corresponding VPN
   instance, and MUST set up the label stack corresponding to the
   pseudowire FEC. For seamless integration between PBB-EVPN and PBB-
   VPLS PEs, this PW is between B-components of PBB-EVPN PE and PBB-VPLS
   PE per section 4 of  [RFC7041].   

   - The (PBB-)EVPN PE must set up the label stack corresponding to the
   MP2P VPN unicast FEC to any remote PE that has advertised EVPN AD
   route.

   - If a (PBB-)EVPN PE receives a VPLS AD route followed by an EVPN AD
   route from the same PE and a pseudowire is setup to that PE, then the
   (PBB-)EVPN MUST bring that pseudowire operationally down.

   - If a (PBB-)EVPN PE receives an EVPN AD route followed by a VPLS AD
   route from the same PE, then the (PBB-)EVPN PE will setup the
   pseudowire but MUST keep it operationally down. 

   When the (PBB-)EVPN PE receives traffic over the pseudowires, it
   learns the associated MAC addresses in the data-plane. This is
   analogous to dynamic learning in IEEE bridges. The MAC addresses
   learned over PWs are not injected into (PBB-)EVPN MAC-VRF tables but
   rather they are injected into their corresponding (PBB-)VPLS VSI
   table. If the core-facing PW belongs to the same split-horizon group
   as the core-facing MP2P EVPN service tunnels, then the MAC addresses
   learned and associated to the PW will NOT be advertised in the
   control plane to any remote (PBB-)EVPN PE. This is because every
   (PBB-)EVPN PE can send and receive traffic directly to/from every
   (PBB-)VPLS PE belonging to the same VPN instance.

   The MAC addresses learned over local Attachment Circuits (ACs) by a
   (PBB-)EVPN PE are advertised in control plane using BGP EVPN routes
   to other (PBB-)EVPN PEs. Furthermore, the MAC addresses learned in
   the control plane, via the BGP EVPN routes sent by remote (PBB-)EVPN
   PEs, are injected into the corresponding MAC-VRF table. This is
   analogous to static learning in IEEE bridges. In PBB-EVPN, a given B-
   MAC address can be learnt either over the BGP control-plane from a
   remote PBB-EVPN PE, or in the data-plane over a pseudowire from a
   remote PBB-VPLS PE. There is no mobility associated with B-MAC
   addresses in this context. Hence, when the same B-MAC address shows
   up behind both a remote PBB-VPLS PE as well as a PBB-EVPN PE, the
   local PE can deduce that it is an anomaly and notify the operator.

3.3 Multicast Operation

3.3.1 Ingress Replication The procedures for multicast operation on the
   (PBB-)VPLS PE, using ingress replication, are per [RFC4761],
   [RFC4762], and [RFC7080].

INTERNET DRAFT  draft-ietf-bess-evpn-vpls-seamless-integ  March 29, 2018


   The procedures for multicast operation on the PBB-EVPN PE, for
   ingress replication, are as follows:

   - The PBB-EVPN PE builds a replication sub-list per I-SID to all the
   remote PBB-EVPN PEs in a given VPN instance, as a result of the
   exchange of the EVPN Inclusive multicast routes, as described in
   [RFC7623]. This will be referred to as sub-list A. It comprises MP2P
   service tunnels used for delivering PBB-EVPN BUM traffic [RFC7432].

   - The PBB-EVPN PE builds a replication sub-list per VPN instance to
   all the remote PBB-VPLS PEs , as a result of the exchange of the VPLS
   AD routes. This will be referred to as sub-list B. It comprises
   pseudowires from the PBB-EVPN PE in question to all the remote PBB-
   VPLS PEs in the same VPN instance.

   - The PBB-EVPN PE may further prune sub-list B, on a per I-SID basis,
   if [MMRP] is run over the PBB-VPLS network. This will be referred to
   as sub-list C. This list comprises a pruned set of the pseudowires in
   sub-list B.

   The replication list, maintained per I-SID, on a given PBB-EVPN PE
   will be the union of sub-list A and sub-list B if [MMRP] is NOT used,
   and the union of sub-list A and sub-list C if [MMRP] is used. Note
   that the PE must enable split-horizon over all the entries in the
   replication list, across both pseudowires and MP2P service tunnels.

3.3.2 P2MP Tunnel The procedures for multicast operation on the PBB-EVPN
   PEs using P2MP tunnels are outside of the scope of this document. 


4 VPLS Integration with EVPN

4.1 Capability Discovery

   The procedures for capability discovery are per Section 3.1 above.

4.2 Forwarding Setup and Unicast Operation

   The operation here is largely similar to that of PBB-EVPN integration
   with PBB-VPLS, with one major exception in handling MAC mobility that
   is described in the next section. 

   - For seamless integration among EVPN and VPLS PEs, the PW that is
   setup between a pair of VPLS and EVPN PEs is between VSI of VPLS PE
   and MAC-VRF of EVPN PE.

4.2.1 MAC Mobility

 


Sajassi et al.         Expires September 29, 2018               [Page 9]

INTERNET DRAFT  draft-ietf-bess-evpn-vpls-seamless-integ  March 29, 2018


   Contrary to PBB-EVPN, where the association between a B-MAC and a
   PBB-EVPN PE is fixed and thus there is no B-MAC mobility, in EVPN,
   host addresses (C-MAC addresses) can move around among EVPN PEs or
   even between EVPN and VPLS PEs.  

   When a MAC address moves from an EVPN PE to a VPLS PE, then as soon
   as BUM traffic is initiated from that MAC address, it is flooded to
   all other PEs (both VPLS and EVPN PEs) and the receiving PEs update
   their MAC tables (VSI or MAC-VRF). The EVPN PEs do not advertise the
   MAC address learned over PW to each other because every EVPN PE
   learns it directly over its associated PW to that VPLS PE. If only
   known-unicast traffic is initiated from the moved MAC address toward
   a known MAC, then this can result in black-holing of traffic destined
   to the MAC that has moved until the MAC age-out timer expires but
   this is the typical behavior of VPLS PEs. 

   When a host MAC address moves from a VPLS PE to an EVPN PE, then as
   soon as BUM or known-unicast traffic is initiated from that MAC
   address, the MAC is learned and advertised in BGP to other EVPN PEs
   and MAC mobility procedure is exercised among EVPN PEs. For BUM
   traffic, both EVPN and VPLS PES learn the new location of the moved
   MAC address; however, if there is only known-unicast traffic, then
   only EVPN PEs learn the new location of the MAC that has moved but
   not VPLS PEs. This can result in black-holing of traffic sent from
   VPLS PEs destined to the MAC that has moved until the MAC age-out
   timer expires but this is the typical behavior of VPLS PEs.         
   

4.3 Multicast Operation

4.3.1 Ingress Replication

   The operation is per the procedures of Section 3.3.1 above for the
   scenario WITHOUT [MMRP]. The replication list is maintained per VPN
   instance rather than per I-SID.

4.3.2 P2MP Tunnel - Inclusive Tree

   The procedures for multicast operation on the EVPN PEs using P2MP
   tunnels are outside of the scope of this document.

5.2 Forwarding Setup and Unicast Operation

   The operation here is largely similar to that of PBB-EVPN integration
   with PBB-VPLS, with a few exceptions listed below:

   - When a PW is setup between a PBB-EVPN PE and a VPLS PE, it gets
   setup between the I-component of PBB-EVPN PE and the VSI of VPLS PE.

   - The MAC mobility aspect is the same as that of VPLS network or PBB-
   VPLS network since in both cases the host MAC (C-MAC) learning over
   MPLS/IP core is done via data-plane learning.  



5.3 Multicast Operation

5.3.1 Ingress Replication

   The operation is per the procedures of Section 3.3.1 above for the
   scenario WITHOUT [MMRP]. The replication list is maintained per I-SID
   on the PBB-EVPN PEs and per VPN instance on the VPLS PEs.

5.3.2 P2MP Tunnel - Inclusive Tree

   The procedures for multicast operation on the PBB-EVPN PEs using P2MP
   tunnels are outside of the scope of this document.


6 Solution Advantages

   The solution for seamless integration of (PBB-)EVPN with (PBB-)VPLS
   has the following advantages:

   - When ingress replication is used for multi-destination traffic
   delivery, the solution reduces the scope of [MMRP] (which is a soft-
   state protocol) to only that of existing VPLS PEs, and uses the more
   robust BGP-based mechanism for multicast pruning among new EVPN PEs.

   - It is completely backward compatible.

   - New PEs can leverage the extensive multi-homing mechanisms and
   provisioning simplifications of PBB-EVPN:
      a. Auto-sensing of MHN / MHD
      b. Auto-discovery of redundancy group
      c. Auto-provisioning in DF election and VLAN carving

   No new security considerations beyond those for VPLS and EVPN.


8  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.
