                     for Edge Computing using ALTO
           draft-yang-alto-deliver-functions-over-networks-00

Abstract

   With development of Internet of Thing (IoT), artificial intelligence,
   huge amount of data are generated and need to be processed.  To
   satisfy the user demands, service providers are deploying edge
   computing across lots of data centers, which are closer to users.  In
   order to achieve better performances, computing functions need to be
   scheduled properly over networks.  However, it is challenging to
   deploy functions to the distributed edge servers efficiently due to
   the lack of network traffic information.  [RFC5693] and [RFC7285]
   introduce and define the Application-Layer Traffic Optimization, or
   ALTO, to compute and provide the network information for the
   distributed applications using the ALTO protocol.  In this document,
   we employ the ALTO protocol to deliver functions in edge computing
   platform, where the protocol will provide the network information for
   the distributed edge computing servers and guide the delivery
   process.  The usage of ALTO will improve the efficiency of function
   delivering in edge computing.

1.  Introduction

   Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence, virtual reality
   and augmented reality (VR/AR) are developing rapidly and promising in
   the future.  The new applications are generating huge amount of data
   that need to be processed efficiently.  The emergence of edge
   computing improves the performance by deploying servers at the edge,

   such that the selected servers would be closer to users, and the
   latency/bandwidth between users and edge servers would be guaranteed.

   Function as a service (FaaS) is becoming more and more popular among
   cloud computing providers, e.g., Amazon Lambda and IBM Openwhisk.
   The current FaaS platform can schedule computing resources
   efficiently in a computing cluster.  However, deploying functions
   over distributed networks is more challenging due to the lack of
   network states and information, including network traffic, topology,
   and other cost metrics, etc.  In this document, we will deliver
   functions over the edge computing networks, to utilize the computing
   and network resource more efficiently.

   We use the ALTO (Application-Layer Traffic Optimization) [RFC7285] to
   optimize the network traffic and performance in delivering functions
   over the edge computing network.  ALTO can provide global network
   information and network traffic for the distributed applications,
   while the information can not be retrieved or computed by the
   applications themselves [RFC5693].  Generally, ALTO protocol will
   collect and compute the network information for the distributed edge
   clusters, including link delay, network traffic, and other cost
   metrics, and help guide the deliver decision process in edge
   computing.  Finally, the edge computing system will deliver the
   functions to the most appropriate edge clusters according to the
   information by ALTO protocol.

   For brevity, in this document, we will use the terminologies
   introduced in [RFC7285] and [I-D.ietf-alto-unified-props-new].

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Background

3.1.  Edge computing

   The proposal of edge computing improves the edge network performance
   in terms of latency, security, bandwidth, etc.  In edge computing
   infrastructure, servers are deployed at the edge, where the network
   performance between servers and users are better.  Users can submit
   their tasks to the edge servers, which will process the tasks and
   return the computational results to the users.  Compared with
   traditional centralized computing, the latency, bandwidth and network
   traffic performance of edge computing is better.  Nowadays, edge

   computing is used in different areas, e.g., latency-sensitive
   applications such as IoT, artificial intelligence, 5G, etc.

   The FaaS technology allows network resources to be dynamically
   allocated to computing clusters.  Users can apply for function-based
   computation services (including object detection, big data analysis,
   etc.) from FaaS providers, and avoid the complicated environment
   configuration and resource management process.  Developers can focus
   on their business and codes rather than environment management, which
   will increase the efficiency of application development and save
   costs for individuals and companies.

   To improve the network performance, we will deliver functions over
   edge computing, such that computing functions can be dynamically
   scheduled in distributed edge computing network.  However, when
   deploying functions to edge servers, network traffic, topology and
   other metrics will influence the performance in terms of latency and
   throughput.  Therefore, we SHOULD consider the network traffic, and
   try to optimize the network performance of the platform.

3.2.  Benefits of ALTO protocol

   Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) [RFC7285] is designed
   to provide network information for the distributed applications.
   More specifically, the ALTO server will offer necessary network
   states and information and guide the resource scheduling process for
   distributed applications that can not retrieve the information by
   themselves.  The ALTO protocol will provide the essential network
   information, including network traffic, cost map, and cost metrics,
   which are necessary in the resource selection process.  In this case,
   the distributed applications are allowed to manage the network
   traffic, and select a better path with low delay to access the
   network and process the computation tasks.

   In edge computing, since the edge computing clusters are distributed
   in the network, they have different network states, including the
   link delay and network traffic.  When delivering functions, the
   delivery decision SHOULD be adaptive to the network states in order
   to achieve a better latency.  Therefore, the ALTO protocol can help
   manage the network information and traffic, such that the function
   can be delivered to a proper edge computing cluster with low latency
   and users can enjoy a better edge computing service.

4.  Scenario of delivering function

   Suppose a scenario in Internet of Things (IoT), where the
   surveillance cameras are distributed, connected via the Internet and
   applying for object detection computing service.  When a camera

   submit a task, the objection detection function will be delivered to
   an edge server that handles the task and returns the results to the
   camera.  The system will request and retrieve the network
   information, including link delay and other cost metrics, by the ALTO
   protocols from ALTO servers and clients.  According to the
   information provided by ALTO, the function and task will be delivered
   to the most appropriate edge server that has the best performance
   from the cameras.  The infrastructure is demonstrated in Figure 1.

5.  Delivering functions over edge computing with ALTO protocol

   In edge computing platform, since lots of edge clusters and servers
   are distributing in the network, the system MUST handle the huge
   amount of edge devices and their corresponding network traffic.  A
   cluster client is employed to manage the connectivity and traffic
   information of the distributed edge clusters.  The ALTO client will
   communicate with the cluster client and provide the necessary network
   information.  The usage of ALTO is to optimize the network traffic
   and guide the function delivering process in edge computing.  It will
   provide the overall network states and information for the
   distributed edge clusters, and decide the appropriate edge cluster to
   deploy the functions.

   More specifically, the ALTO server will collect and compute the
   network cost metrics, including the link delay, availability, network
   traffic, bandwidth, etc.  Then the information will be sent to the
   ALTO client.  The ALTO client will select the target appropriate edge
   clusters to deploy the target function.  Finally, the system will
   connect and deploy the function to the target servers, such that
   users can submit their computation task to the selected edge
   clusters.

   Figure 2 illustrates the infrastructure and function delivering
   process of the edge computing platform.

      1.  The ALTO client requests the information, such as network map
      and cost map of distributed edge clusters from the ALTO server by
      using ALTO protocol.

      2.  The Cluster Client requests edge cluster list of the network.

      3.  The ALTO Client returns the edge cluster list and
      corresponding resource information about the clusters computed by
      ALTO servers according to the network state.

      4.  The Cluster Client connects and delivers function to the
      corresponding edge computing cluster according to the information,
      and the cluster will process and return the computation results to
      users.

   Note that the data transfer process is using the ALTO protocol
   described in [RFC7285] to guarantee the efficiency and security of
   the delivering process.  In this case, the edge computing clusters
   are allowed to retrieve the network information, such that the
   function can be delivered to the proper ones to achieve a better
   performance in terms of latency, throughput, etc.

6.  Implementation and Deployment

6.1.  Implementation

   We are inspired by the concept of Serverless Computing, which is a
   new computing paradigm providing function-based computing service,
   and utilize the containerization technology to run the functions.
   The container, including the running code, library, and data
   dependencies, will be deployed and orchestrated to target edge
   servers and clusters by container orchestrator Kubernetes (or K8S).
   The container orchestration scheme will be computed according to the
   network information provided by ALTO.

   We use IBM OpenWhisk as the FaaS platform in edge clusters, where the
   resources are managed by K8S.  Using the containerization technology,
   functions can be flexibly delivered to the target edge server, When a
   user request for function-based edge computing services, its request
   will be redirected to the edge server for better performance.

6.2.  Deployment

   We have implemented a prototype, and are deploying it in real
   networks across different service providers (T.B.D).

6.3.  ALTO Integration
