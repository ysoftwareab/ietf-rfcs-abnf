 DNS Server Privacy Statement and Filtering Policy with Assertion Token
              draft-reddy-dprive-dprive-privacy-policy-03

Abstract

   Users may want to control how their DNS queries are handled by DNS
   servers so they can configure their system to use DNS servers that
   comply with their privacy and DNS filtering expectations.

   This document defines a mechanism for a DNS server to communicate its
   privacy statement URL and filtering policy to a DNS client.  This
   communication is cryptographically signed to attest its authenticity.
   By evaluating the DNS privacy statement, filtering policy and the
   signatory, the user can choose a DNS server that best supports his/
   her desired privacy and filtering policy.  This token is particularly
   useful for DNS-over-TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS servers that are either
   public resolvers or are discovered on a local network.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC7626] discusses DNS privacy considerations in both "on the wire"
   (Section 2.4 of [RFC7626]) and "in the server" (Section 2.5 of
   [RFC7626] contexts.  In recent years there has also been an increase
   in the availability of "public resolvers" [RFC8499] which DNS clients
   may be pre-configured to use instead of the default network resolver
   because they offer a specific feature (e.g., good reachability,
   encrypted transport, strong privacy policy, (lack of) filtering,
   etc.).  The DNS Recursive Operator Privacy (DROP) statement explained
   in [I-D.ietf-dprive-bcp-op] outlines the recommended contents an DNS
   operator should publish, thereby providing a means for users to
   evaluate the privacy properties of a given DNS service.  While a
   human can review the privacy statement of a DNS server operator, but
   the challenge is the user has to search to find the URL that points
   to the human readable privacy policy information of the DNS server.
   Also, a user does not know if a locally-discovered server performs
   DNS-based filtering.

   For DNS servers operated on the local network, the DNS client can be
   securely bootstrapped to discover and authenticate DNS-over-HTTPS
   (DoH) [RFC8484] and DNS-over-TLS (DoT) [RFC7858] servers provided by
   a local network, for example using the technique proposed in
   [I-D.reddy-dprive-bootstrap-dns-server].  This document defines a
   retrievable DNS server policy permitting the user to consent to using
   a certain DNS server that meets their needs.

   The cryptographically signed policy allows a DNS client to connect to
   multiple DNS servers and prompt the user to review the DNS privacy
   statements to select the DNS server that adheres to the privacy
   preserving data policy and DNS filtering expectations of the user.
   For example, a browser with pre-configured DNS-over-HTTPS server can
   discover the DNS-over-HTTPS server provided the local network,
   connects to both the DNS servers, gets the policy information from
   each of the DNS servers, validates the signatures and prompts the
   user to review the privacy policy statements of both the local and

   public DNS server.  If both servers meet the privacy preserving data
   policy and DNS filtering requirements of the user, the user can
   select to use the local DNS server.  A quality implementation can
   avoid presenting this information to the user if the DNS server's
   policies have not changed.

2.  Use Cases Overview

   The mechanism for a DNS server to communicate its cryptographically
   signed policies to a DNS client contribute to solve the following
   problems in various deployments:

   o  Typically Enterprise networks do not assume that all devices in
      their network are managed by the IT team or Mobile Device
      Management (MDM) devices, especially in the quite common BYOD
      (Bring Your Own Device) scenario.  The mechanism specified in this
      document can be used by users of the BYOD devices to determine if
      the DNS server on the local network complies with the user's
      privacy policy and DNS filtering expectations.

   o  The user selects specific well-known networks (e.g., organization
      for which a user works or a user works temporarily within another
      corporation) to learn the privacy policy statement and filtering
      policy of the local DNS server.  Then, the user can choose to use
      the discovered DoT or DoH server.  If that discovered DoT/DoH
      server does not meet the privacy preserving data policy and
      filtering requirements of the user, the user can instruct the DNS
      client to take appropriate actions.  For example, the action can
      be to use the local DNS server only to access internal-only DNS
      names and use another DNS server (adhering with his/her
      expectations) for public domains.

   o  The policy information signals the presence of DNS-based content
      filtering in the attached network.  If the network is well-known
      to the user and the local DNS server meets the privacy
      requirements of the user, the DNS client can continue to use
      encrypted connection with the local DoT/DoH server.  If the error
      code returned by the DNS server indicates access to the domain is
      blocked because of internal security policy
      [I-D.ietf-dnsop-extended-error], the DNS client can securely
      identify access to the domain is censored by the network.

   o  The signed policy contains an URL that points to a human-readable
      privacy policy information of the DNS server for the user to
      review and can make an informed decision whether the DNS server is
      trustworthy to honor the privacy of the user.  The DNS Push
      Notifications mechanism defined in [I-D.ietf-dnsop-extended-error]
      can be used by the DNS client to be asynchronously notified when

Internet-Draft         DNS Server Filtering Policy            March 2020


      the policy change occurs.  The client automatically learns updates
      to the policy of the DNS server, and whenever the privacy
      statement of the DNS server changes, the client can notify the
      user to re-evaluate the updated privacy statement.

3.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document uses the terms defined in [RFC8499].

4.  Policy Assertion Token (PAT): Overview

   JSON Web Token (JWT) [RFC7519] and JSON Web Signature (JWS) [RFC7515]
   and related specifications define a standard token format that can be
   used as a way of encapsulating claimed or asserted information with
   an associated digital signature using X.509 based certificates.  JWT
   provides a set of claims in JSON format that can accommodate asserted
   policy information of the DoT/DoH server.  Additionally, JWS provides
   a path for updating methods and cryptographic algorithms used for the
   associated digital signatures.

   JWS defines the use of JSON data structures in a specified canonical
   format for signing data corresponding to JOSE header, JWS Payload,
   and JWS Signature.  The next sections define the header and claims
   that MUST be minimally used with JWT and JWS for privacy assertion
   token.

   The Policy Assertion Token (PAT) specifically uses this token format
   and defines claims that convey the policy information of DoT/ DoH
   server.  The client can retrieve the PAT object using the method
   discussed in [I-D.ietf-dnsop-resolver-information].  The signature of
   PAT object can be validated by the DNS client.  If the signer and the
   contents of the PAT object comply with the user's requirements, the
   user's client software can use that DNS server.

   The PAT object is signed by the DNS server's domain that is
   authoritative to assert the DNS server policy information.  This
   authority is represented by the certificate credentials and the
   signature.

   For example, the PAT object could be created by the domain hosting
   the DoT/DoH server and optionally by a third party who performed
   privacy and security audit of the DoT/DoH server.  The DNS client

Internet-Draft         DNS Server Filtering Policy            March 2020


   needs to have the capability to verify the digital signature and to
   parse the PAT object.

5.  PAT Header

   The JWS token header is a JOSE header (Section 4 of [RFC7515]) that
   defines the type and encryption algorithm used in the token.

   PAT header MUST include, at a minimum, the header parameters defined
   in Sections 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3.

5.1.  'typ' (Type) Header Parameter

   The 'typ' (Type) Header Parameter is defined Section 4.1.9 of
   [RFC7515] to declare the media type of the complete JWS.

   For PAT Token the 'typ' header MUST be the string 'pat'.  This
   represents that the encoded token is a JWT of type pat.

5.2.  'alg' (Algorithm) Header Parameter

   The 'alg' (Algorithm) Header Parameter is defined in Section 4.1.1 of
   [RFC7515].  It specifies the JWS signature cryptographic algorithm.
   It also refers to a list of defined 'alg' values as part of a
   registry established by JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) [RFC7518]
   Section 3.1.

   For the creation and verification of PAT tokens and their digital
   signatures, implementations MUST support ES256 as defined in
   Section 3.4 of [RFC7518].  Implementations MAY support other
   algorithms registered in the JSON Web Signature and Encryption
   Algorithms registry created by [RFC7518].  The content of that
   registry may be updated in the future depending on cryptographic
   strength requirements guided by current security best practice.  The
   mandatory-to-support algorithm for PAT tokens may likewise be updated
   in the future.

   Implementations of PAT digital signatures using ES256 as defined
   above SHOULD use deterministic ECDSA when supported for the reasons
   stated in [RFC6979].

5.3.  'x5u' (X.509 URL) Header Parameter

   As defined in Section 4.1.5 of [RFC7515], the 'x5u' header parameter
   defines a URI [RFC3986] referring to the resource for the X.509
   public key certificate or certificate chain [RFC5280] corresponding
   to the key used to digitally sign the JWS.  Generally, as defined in

   Section 4.1.5 of [RFC7515] this corresponds to an HTTPS or DNSSEC
   resource using integrity protection.

5.4.  An Example of PAT Header

   An example of the PAT header is shown in Figure 1.  It includes the
   specified PAT type, ES256 algorithm, and an URI referencing the
   network location of the certificate needed to validate the PAT
   signature.

   {
     "typ":"pat",
     "alg":"ES256",
     "x5u":"https://cert.example.com/pat.cer"
   }

                      Figure 1: A PAT Header Example

6.  PAT Payload

   The token claims consists of the policy information of the DNS server
   which needs to be verified at the DNS client.  These claims follow
   the definition of a JWT claim (Secion 4 of [RFC7519]) and are encoded
   as defined by the JWS Payload (Section 3 of [RFC7515]).

   PAT defines the use of a standard JWT-defined claim as well as custom
   claims corresponding to the DoT or DoH servers.

   Claim names MUST use the US-ASCII character set.  Claim values MAY
   contain characters that are outside the ASCII range, however they
   MUST follow the default JSON serialization defined in Section 7 of
   [RFC7519].

6.1.  JWT Defined Claims

6.1.1.  'iat' - Issued At Claim

   The JSON claim MUST include the 'iat' (Section 4.1.6 of [RFC7519])
   defined claim "Issued At".  The 'iat' should be set to the date and
   time of issuance of the JWT.  The time value should be of the format
   (NumericDate) defined in Section 2 of [RFC7519].

6.1.2.  'exp' - Expiration Time Claim

   The JSON claim MUST include the 'exp' (Section 4.1.4 of [RFC7519])
   defined "claim Expiration Time".  The 'exp' should be set to specify
   the expiration time on or after which the JWT is not accepted for
   processing.  The PAT object should expire after a reasonable

Internet-Draft         DNS Server Filtering Policy            March 2020


   duration.  A short expiration time for the PAT object periodically
   reaffirms the policy information of the DNS server to the DNS client
   and ensures the DNS client does not use outdated policy information.
   If the DNS client knows the PAT object has expired, it should make
   another request to get the new PAT object from the DNS server.

6.2.  PAT Specific Claims

6.2.1.  DNS Server Identity Claims

   The DNS server identity is represented by a claim that is required
   for PAT: the 'server' claim.  The 'server' MUST contain claim values
   that are identity claim JSON objects where the child claim name
   represents an identity type and the claim value is the identity
   string, both defined in subsequent subsections.

   These identities can be represented as either authentication domain
   name (ADN) (defined in [RFC8310]) or Uniform Resource Indicators
   (URI).

6.2.1.1.  'adn' - Authentication Domain Name Identity

   If the DNS server identity is an ADN, the claim name representing the
   identity MUST be 'adn'.  The claim value for the 'adn' claim is the
   ADN.

6.2.1.2.  'uri' - URI Identity

   If the DNS server identity is of the form URI, as defined in
   [RFC3986], the claim name representing the identity MUST be 'uri' and
   the claim value is the URI form of the DNS server identity.

   As a reminder, if DoH is supported by the DNS server, the DNS client
   uses the https URI scheme (Section 3 of [RFC8484]).

6.2.2.  'policyinfo' (Policy Information) Claim

   The 'policyinfo' claim MUST be formatted as a JSON object.  The
   'policyinfo' claim contains the policy information of the DNS server,
   it includes the following attributes:

   filtering:  If the DNS server changes some of the answers that it
      returns based on policy criteria, such as to prevent access to
      malware sites or objectionable content.  This optional attribute
      has the following structure:

Internet-Draft         DNS Server Filtering Policy            March 2020


      malwareblocking:  The DNS server offers malware blocking service.
         If access to domains is blocked on threat data, the parameter
         value is set to 'true'.

      policyblocking:  If access to domains is blocked on a blacklist or
         objectionable content, the parameter value is set to 'true'.

   qnameminimization:  If the DNS server implements QNAME minimisation
      [RFC7816] to improve DNS privacy.  If the parameter value is set
      to 'true', QNAME minimisation is supported by the DNS server.
      This is a mandatory attribute.

   privacyurl:  A URL that points to the privacy policy information of
      the DNS server.  This is a mandatory attribute.

   auditurl:  A URL that points to the security assessment report of the
      DNS server by a third party auditor.  This is an optional
      attribute.

6.2.3.  Example

   Figure 2 shows an example of policy information.

   {
     "server":{
         "adn":["example.com"]
     },
     "iat":1443208345,
     "exp":1443640345,
     "policyinfo": {
        "filtering": {
            "malwareblocking": true,
            "policyblocking": false
        },
        "qnameminimization":false,
        "privacyurl": "https://example.com/commitment-to-privacy/"
     }
   }

7.  PAT Signature

   The signature of the PAT is created as specified in Section 5.1 of
   [RFC7515] (Steps 1 through 6).  PAT MUST use the JWS Protected
   Header.





Reddy, et al.           Expires September 4, 2020               [Page 9]

Internet-Draft         DNS Server Filtering Policy            March 2020


   For the JWS Payload and the JWS Protected Header, the lexicographic
   ordering and white space rules described in Section 5 and Section 6,
   and JSON serialization rules in Section 9 MUST be followed.

   The PAT is cryptographically signed by the domain hosting the DNS
   server and optionally by a third party who performed privacy and
   security audit of the DNS server.

   The policy information is attested using "Organization Validation"
   (OV) or "Extended Validation" (EV) certificates to avoid bad actors
   taking advantage of this mechanism to advertise DoH/DoT servers for
   illegitimate and fraudulent purposes meant to trick DNS clients into
   believing that they are using a legitimate DoT/DoH server hosted to
   provide privacy for DNS transactions.

   Alternatively, a DNS client has to be configured to trust the leaf of
   the signer of the PAT object.  That is, trust of the signer MUST NOT
   be determined by validating the signer via the OS or the browser
   trust chain because that would allow any arbitrary entity to operate
   a DNS server and assert any sort of policy.

   Appendix A provides an example of how to follow the steps to create
   the JWS Signature.

   JWS JSON serialization (Step 7 in Section 5.1 of [RFC7515]) is
   supported for PAT to enable multiple signatures to be applied to the
   PAT object.  For example, the PAT object can be cryptographically
   signed by the domain hosting the DNS server and by a third party who
   performed privacy and security audit of the DNS server.

   Appendix B includes an example of the full JWS JSON serialization
   representation with multiple signatures.

   Section 5.1 of [RFC7515] (Step 8) describes the method to create the
   final JWS Compact Serialization form of the PAT Token.

8.  Extending PAT

   PAT includes the minimum set of claims needed to securely assert the
   policy information of the DNS server.  JWT supports a mechanism to
   add additional asserted or signed information by simply adding new
   claims.  PAT can be extended beyond the defined base set of claims to
   represent other DNS server information requiring assertion or
   validation.  Specifying new claims follows the baseline JWT
   procedures (Section 10.1 of [RFC7519]).  Understanding new claims on
   the DNS client is optional.  The creator of a PAT object cannot
   assume that the DNS client will understand the new claims.

9.  Deterministic JSON Serialization

   JSON objects can include spaces and line breaks, and key value pairs
   can occur in any order.  It is therefore a non-deterministic string
   format.  In order to make the digital signature verification work
   deterministically, the JSON representation of the JWS Protected
   Header object and JWS Payload object MUST be computed as follows.

   The JSON object MUST follow the following rules.  These rules are
   based on the thumbprint of a JSON Web Key (JWK) as defined in
   Section 3 of [RFC7638] (Step 1).

   1.  The JSON object MUST contain no whitespace or line breaks before
       or after any syntactic elements.

   2.  JSON objects MUST have the keys ordered lexicographically by the
       Unicode [UNICODE] code points of the member names.

   3.  JSON value literals MUST be lowercase.

   4.  JSON numbers are to be encoded as integers unless the field is
       defined to be encoded otherwise.

   5.  Encoding rules MUST be applied recursively to member values and
       array values.

9.1.  Example PAT Deterministic JSON Form

   This section demonstrates the deterministic JSON serialization for
   the example PAT Payload shown in Section 6.2.3.

   The initial JSON object is shown in Figure 3.

   {
     "server":{
         "adn":["example.com"]
     },
     "iat":1443208345,
     "exp":1443640345,
     "policyinfo": {
        "qnameminimization":false,
        "privacyurl": "https://example.com/commitment-to-privacy/"
     }
   }

Internet-Draft         DNS Server Filtering Policy            March 2020


   The parent members of the JSON object are as follows, in
   lexicographic order: "exp", "iat", "policyinfo", "server".

   The final constructed deterministic JSON serialization
   representation, with whitespace and line breaks removed, (with line
   breaks used for display purposes only) is:

{"exp":1443640345,"iat":1443208345,
"policyinfo":{"privacyurl":"https://example.com/commitment-to-privacy/",
"qnameminimization":false},"server":{"adn":["example.com"]}}

                     Figure 4: Deterministic JSON Form

10.  Privacy Considerations

   Users are expected to indicate to their system in some way that they
   trust certain PAT signers (e.g., if working for Example, Inc., the
   user's system is configured to trust "example.com" signing the PAT).
   By doing so, the DNS client can automatically discover DoT/DoH server
   in specific networks, validate the PAT signature and the user can
   check if the human readable privacy policy information of the DNS
   server complies with user's privacy needs, prior to using that DoT/
   DoH server for DNS queries.

   The DNS client MUST retrieve the human-readable privacy statement
   from the 'privacyurl' attribute to assist with that decision (e.g.,
   display the privacy statement when it changes, show differences in
   previously-retrieved version, etc.).  With the steps above, user
   consent is obtained prior to using a DoT/DoH server.

11.  Security Considerations

   The use of PAT object based on the validation of the digital
   signature and the associated certificate requires consideration of
   the authentication and authority or reputation of the signer to
   attest the policy information of the DNS server being asserted.  Bad
   actors can host DNS-over-TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS servers, and claim
   the servers offer privacy but exactly do the opposite to invade the
   privacy of the user.  Bad actor can get a domain name, host DNS-over-
   TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS servers, and get the DNS server certificate
   signed by a CA.  The policy information will have to be attested
   using OV/EV certificates or a PAT object signer trusted by the DNS
   client to prevent the attack.

   If the PAT object is asserted by a third party, it can do a "time of
   check" but the DNS server is susceptible of "time of use" attack.
   For example, changes to the policy of the DNS server can cause a
   disagreement between the auditor and the DNS server operation, hence

   the PAT object needs to be also asserted by the domain hosting the
   DNS server.  In addition, the PAT object needs to have a short
   expiration time (e.g., 7 days) to ensure the DNS server's domain re-
   asserts the policy information and limits the damage from change in
   policy and mis-issuance.

Appendix A.  Example ES256 based PAT JWS Serialization and Signature

   For PAT, there will always be a JWS with the following members:

   o  'protected', with the value BASE64URL(UTF8(JWS Protected Header))

   o  'payload', with the value BASE64URL (JWS Payload)

   o  'signature', with the value BASE64URL(JWS Signature)

   This example will follow the steps in JWS [RFC7515] Section 5.1,
   steps 1-6 and 8 and incorporates the additional serialization steps
   required for PAT.

   Step 1 for JWS references the JWS Payload, an example PAT Payload is
   as follows:

   {
     "server":{
         "adn":["example.com"]
     },
     "iat":1443208345,
     "exp":1443640345,
     "policyinfo": {
        "filtering": {
            "malwareblocking": true,
            "policyblocking": false
        },
        "qnameminimization":false,
        "privacyurl": "https://example.com/commitment-to-privacy/"
     }
   }

   This would be serialized to the form (with line break used for
   display purposes only):

   {"exp":1443640345,"iat":1443208345,"policyinfo":{
   "filtering":{"malwareblocking": true,"policyblocking": false},
   "privacyurl":"https://example.com/commitment-to-privacy/",
   "qnameminimization":false},"server":{"adn":["example.com"]}}

   Step 2 Computes the BASE64URL(JWS Payload) producing this value (with
   line break used for display purposes only):

   c2VydmVyIjp7ImFkbiI6WyJleGFtcGxlLmNvbSJdfX0



   For Step 3, an example PAT Protected Header comprising the JOSE
   Header is as follows:

   {
     "alg":"ES256",
     "typ":"pat",
     "x5u":"https://cert.example.com/pat.cer"
   }

   This would be serialized to the form (with line break used for
   display purposes only):

   {"alg":"ES256","typ":"pat","x5u":"https://cert.example.com
   /pat.cer"}

   Step 4 Performs the BASE64URL(UTF8(JWS Protected Header)) operation
   and encoding produces this value (with line break used for display
   purposes only):

   eGFtcGxlLmNvbS9wYXQuY2VyIn0



   Step 5 and Step 6 performs the computation of the digital signature
   of the PAT Signing Input ASCII(BASE64URL(UTF8(JWS Protected
   Header)) || '.' || BASE64URL(JWS Payload)) using ES256 as the
   algorithm and the BASE64URL(JWS Signature).

        "privacyurl": "https://example.com/commitment-to-privacy/"
     }
   }

   This would be serialized to the form (with line break used for
   display purposes only):

   {"exp":1443640345,"iat":1443208345,"policyinfo":{
   "filtering":{"malwareblocking": true,"policyblocking": false},
   "privacyurl":"https://example.com/commitment-to-privacy/",
   "qnameminimization":false},"server":{"adn":["example.com"]}}

   The JWS protected Header value used for the first signature is same
   as that used in the example in Appendix A.  The X.509 private key
   used for generating the first signature is same as that used in the
   example in Appendix A.1.

   The JWS Protected Header value used for the second signature is:

   {
     "alg":"ES384",
     "typ":"pat",
     "x5u":"https://cert.audit-example.com/pat.cer"
   }

   The complete JWS JSON Serialization for these values is as follows
   (with line breaks within values for display purposes only):
