Abstract

   The definition of RADIUS attribute "Framed-Compression" in RFC 2865
   does not include values for new Header Compression schemes like ROHC,
   ROHC-TCP.  This document defines the new values to the "Framed-
   Compression" attribute.

1.  Introduction

   RFC 2865 defines the Framed-Compression attribute.  This attribute is
   used today to indicate compression protocol to be used for the radio
   link.  The NAS (also wireless access gateway) also uses this
   attribute to convey its capability to the AAA server.

   The values defined for Framed-Compression attribute are as follows:

   0      None

   1      VJ TCP/IP header compression

   2      IPX header compression

   3      Stac-LZS compression

   There are newer header compression schemes defined by IETF e.g.
   ROHC.  ROHC is being deployed worldwide and it is especially gaining
   immense popularity in 3G wireless networks.

   This document defines the additional Framed-Compression attribute
   values required for ROHC support.

2.  Terminology

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD",  "SHOULD  NOT",  "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY",  and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

3.  New values for the Framed-Compression

   Proposed revision in RFC 2865 for Framed-Compression attribute:

   Description

   This Attribute indicates a compression protocol to be used for the
   link.  It MAY be used in Access-Accept packets.  It MAY be used in an
   Access-Request packet as a hint to the server that the NAS would
   prefer to supports the use that a compression scheme, but the RADIUS
   server is not required to honor the hint.

   More than one compression protocol Attribute MAY be sent in the same
   RADIUS message.  It is the responsibility of the NAS to apply the
   proper compression protocol to appropriate link traffic.

   A summary of the Framed-Compression Attribute format is shown below.
   The fields are transmitted from left to right.



      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

                    Value (cont)         |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+



   Type: 13 for Framed-Compression.

   Length: 6.

   Value:

   The Value field is four octets.

   0      None

   1      VJ TCP/IP header compression

   2      IPX header compression

   3      Stac-LZS compression

   TBD-1	RObust Header Compression [RFC3095].

   TBD-2	VJ TCP/IP header compression and RObust Header Compression
   		[ROHC-VJ].  When this value is negotiated, VJ compression 
		is used for all TCP/IP traffic and ROHC compression is used 
		for remaining traffic (UDP/IP, RTP/IP, ESP/IP).

   TBD-3	Link Layer Assisted RObust Header Compression [RFC3242].

4.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any new security concerns beyond
   those specified in the basic DHCP [RFC2865].

5.  IANA Considerations

   The following values for Framed-Compression attribute MUST be
   assigned by IANA:

   TBD-1	RObust Header Compression [RFC3095].

   TBD-2	VJ TCP/IP header compression and RObust Header Compression
   		[ROHC-VJ].

   TBD-3	Link Layer Assisted RObust Header Compression [RFC3242].
