3.  Use Cases

3.1.  Advanced Metering Infrastructure

   Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) is an integrated system of
   smart meters, communication networks and data management
   applications.  The coverage of Wi-SUN signal is typically 2~3 km,
   matching the needs of neighborhood area networks, campus area
   networks, or corporate area networks (CAN).  AMI can use Wi-SUN as
   the single technology to read various types of meters (electricity,
   gas, water) within one network.

   Besides the daily or monthly meter reading for bill charging,
   customers also desire to have a more frequent meter reading to build
   detailed consumption reports.  For such scenarios, the sampling rate
   of AMI can be once every 10 minutes or even more.  Wi-SUN devices are
   designed for frequent communications (as often as every 10 seconds),
   satisfying AMI's requirement on sampling rate.  Moreover, the MAC MTU
   of 2047 bytes of Wi-SUN supports the aggregation of locally cached
   samples into a single packet, which can then be uploaded far less

   often (e.g. daily).  A battery-powered Wi-SUN device can last for up
   to 10 years without needing battery replacement.

   Wi-SUN's symmetric uplink/downlink capability and data rate (up to
   300kbps) allow interactive communications between end devices and
   gateways.  Customers are able to read their meters and get a timely
   response.  When an outage occurs, the operator can interactively
   "ping" each meter to verify its status, so that the trouble spots can
   be diagnosed.  For these two cases, the meters should respond in
   real-time.

3.2.  Intelligent Street Lights

   Enabling Intelligent Street Lights is an important use for urban IoT.
   Various end devices can be integrated in a single street light pole
   for the purposes of adaptive lighting, environment monitoring,
   utility management, advertising and so on.

   Wi-SUN supports a high duty cycle enabling frequent data transmission
   -- as often as once every 10 seconds.  With Wi-SUN, sensors such as
   temperature, humidity and air quality mounted on a light pole can
   maintain a high sampling rate.  Wi-SUN's large MTU (2047 bytes) also
   allows data from different sensors to be packed within a single
   packet.

   As an example for utility management, in the current trash
   collection, the sanitation workers have to pass by to check each
   trash can periodically.  Since the workers cannot tell whether a can
   contains any trash, sometimes they come by only to find that the can
   is empty.  If sensors are deployed in the cans, the workers will be
   informed before attempting collection.  Given detailed information
   about the quantity and type of trash , the right type of vehicle can
   be sent for collection, and an efficient schedule and path can be
   planned.  Such on-demand collection can reduce the operations cost of
   sanitation companies.  The communication devices in the trash cans
   would be powered by battery, and their life time should be long
   enough to minimize the need for battery replacement.  In order to
   save energy, the device is activated only when needed; otherwise it
   is in deep sleep mode.  Battery powered Wi-SUN devices can last for
   years due to low power consumption.  The range of Wi-SUN can be 2~3km
   in line of sight, so that a gateway mounted on a light pole would
   cover the end-devices in a district area.  If a physical obstruction
   exists, the range can be extended by multi-hop connection between
   mains powered Wi-SUN gateways.

4.  Security Considerations

   Security is a core concern for many IoT/lpwan networks.  Compromised
   devices can be used to mount attacks on other networks, resulting in
   disruption of essential services (as would be the case for critical
   IoT networks used for public safety) or costly technology
   replacements.  Networks based on WiSUN can provide excellent security
   by offering a number of standardized and powerful features such as
   Public Key Infrastructure certificates, 802.11i, AES, HMAC, and
   others as described in [citation required].
