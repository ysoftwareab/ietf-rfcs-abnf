Abstract

   RFC 3095 defines a Proposed Standard protocol for RObust Header
   Compression (ROHC). In order to move the standard further to Draft
   Standard status, it is required to demonstrate interoperability for
   all functionality defined by the RFC. This document outlines those
   features to be tested, and also the test status for each feature,
   based on reports from interoperability tests or other proof of
   interoperability.

1.  Introduction

   The Internet standards process [RFC-2026] places a number of
   requirements on a standards track protocol specification. In
   particular, when advancing a protocol from Proposed Standard to Draft
   Standard level it is necessary to demonstrate at least two
   independent and interoperable implementations, from different code
   bases, of all options and features of that protocol. Further, in
   cases where one or more options or features have not been
   demonstrated in at least two interoperable implementations, the
   specification may advance to Draft Standard level only if those
   options or features are removed.

   The RObust Header Compression (ROHC) framework and initial profiles
   was originally specified in RFC 3095 as a Proposed Standard [RFC-
   3095]. Since the publication of RFC 3095, the protocol has been
   implemented by a number of different parties, who have also performed
   interoperability tests to verify both their implementations and the
   standard itself.

   As part of the process of taking RFC 3095 further to Draft Standard
   level, it has become necessary to clearly define what must be tested,
   and also collect the test status for each item. This document aims at
   providing that, by initially listing all pieces of the RFC 3095
   mechanisms which must be subject to interoperability testing. The
   intention is further to regularly revise this document with status
   information for each item, as interoperability updates are reported
   from the community.


1.1.  Overview of Test Strategies

   This document basically consists of two parts. First, section 2 lists
   general, profile independent, pieces to be tested, and then the rest
   of the document covers detailed test cases for each profile in
   separate sections.




Jonsson                                                         [Page 2]

INTERNET-DRAFT        Interoperability of RFC 3095      October 25, 2002


   All profile test lists have a common structure and covers the
   following test case groups:
   - Interoperable exchange of all header formats
   - Interoperable exchange of feedback data, using all feedback formats
   - All possible mode transitions
   - Other features, such as various encoding mechanisms that use the
     same header formats.

   An interoperable exchange includes compression and transmission, but
   especially correct interpretation and decompression. Correctness is
   assumed to be verified by comparing the uncompressed input header
   with the decompressed output. For feedback data, an interoperable
   exchange assumes a similar procedure in the opposite transmission
   direction. However, since feedback packets are generated by the
   decompressor and terminated by the compressor, there are no original
   data to compare with output data. Correct interpretation of feedback
   data must therefore be ensured by other means. Since robustness is an
   important goal of the ROHC scheme, there are several mechanisms that
   would not be exceedingly tested without operating on the robustness
   limits of those mechanisms. However, it gets extremely complicated to
   define test cases covering all potential combinations of compressed
   headers, loss scenarios, and the resulting decompression. Therefore,
   if not explicitly stated otherwise, tests defined in this document
   assume loss-less transmission between compressor and decompressor.


2.  General ROHC Feature Tests

   Although not yet explicitly defined, the ROHC framework includes a
   number of general mechanisms that are common for all profiles. This
   section lists test cases for these framework mechanisms (FW).

   Test cases for ROHC framework mechanisms:

     FW-CID-S.  Interoperable exchange of non-padded and non-segmented
                ROHC small-CID packets without an ADD-CID octet.

     FW-CID-A.  Interoperable exchange of non-padded and non-segmented
                ROHC small-CID packets with the ADD-CID octet present.

     FW-CID-L.  Interoperable exchange of non-padded and non-segmented
                ROHC large-CID packets.

     FW-SEG-1.  Interoperable exchange of ROHC packets segmented with
                the ROHC segmentation scheme, correctly reassembled, and
                validated with the 4-octet segmentation CRC.

     FW-SEG-2.  Interoperable exchange of ROHC packet segments where a
                lost segment causes the reassembled packet to be
                discarded due to an invalidation by the 4-octet
                segmentation CRC.

7.  Security Considerations

   When implementing and testing various protocol mechanisms as
   described in this document, the security issues of [RFC-3095] should
   be taken into consideration. This document, however, does not imply
   any additional security aspects to be considered.
