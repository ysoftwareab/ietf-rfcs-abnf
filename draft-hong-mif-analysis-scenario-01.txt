   and a description of scenarios of multiple interfaces with the
   respect of the relationship between layer 2 connection and layer 3
   connection.  The current TCP/IP mechanism and networking methods are
   suitable for single network interface.  When a host has multiple
   interfaces, the current TCP/IP mechanism and networking methods
   cannot directly be used for them.  A network interface establishes
   layer 2 connection to layer 2 entity (e.g., WLAN Access Point) and it
   does not mean providing proper layer 3 connection.  So every active
   network interfaces do not guarantee successful IP layer operations.
   In this document, we describe some problems for a host which has
   multiple interfaces as an aspect of host's operations and usage
   scenarios of multiple interfaces in a host.

Internet-Draft           mif analysis & scenario               July 2009


1.  Introduction

   In future ubiquitous networks, many services and many access
   technologies are expected to be interworked and harmonized for better
   services.  To do so, a host must have a ability to connect different
   access technology networks and different network interfaces for each
   access technology.

   Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775][1] and NEMO Basic Support [RFC3963] [2] can
   solve the problem of the change of IPv6 network address when a mobile
   node or a mobile router moves.  But these protocols are developed for
   a mobile node with a single network interface and a mobile router
   with a single egress network interface.  Due to multiple interfaces,
   many things should be considered such as multiple CoA, multiple HoA,
   and multiple HA.  We cannot directly use basic Mobile IPv6 for a
   mobile node with multiple network interfaces.  IETF MEXT working
   group are targeting to solve these problems and has many progress.

   If a host has multiple interfaces, this situation influences not only
   mobility issues (e.g., extending Mobile IPv6/NEMO Basic Support) but
   also general networking operations and TCP/IP mechanism
   [I-D.blanchet-mif-problem-statement][3].

   In this document we analyze the problems of multiple interfaces in a
   host as an aspect of host's operations with the focusing on routing
   issues.  Because of the simultaneous usage of multiple interfaces in
   communications, current networking methods which are based on single
   interface may have several problems.  And we describe the usage
   scenarios of multiple interfaces in a host with the respect of the
   relationship between layer connection and layer 3 connection.  A
   network interface establishes layer 2 connection to layer 2 entity
   (e.g., WLAN Access Point) and it does not mean providing proper layer
   3 connection.  So every active network interfaces do not guarantee
   successful IP layer operations.  In this document, we categorize each
   usage scenarios by the usage of the number of network interface,
   layer 2 network, and layer 3 network.  And in each scenario, we
   identify whether that scenario belongs to MIF scope or not and what
   kind of problems should be considered.


2.  Analysis of the problems of multiple interface usage

2.1.  Relation between network interface and destination address

   A host with multiple interfaces may simultaneously use its interfaces
   for communication with a correspondent node.  If a host
   simultaneously uses multiple interfaces, it seems that the following
   two cases can be considered.



Hong, et al.            Expires January 14, 2010                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft           mif analysis & scenario               July 2009


   - All interfaces activates and simultaneously sends/receives packets
   at a time. (all of them has layer 3 connections)

   - All interfaces activates but just some of them sends/receives
   packets at a time. (some of them just have layer 2 connections)

   If a host has single interface, the relation between network
   interface and destination address is static and is one-to-one
   mapping.  But, if a host has multiple interfaces, this relation is
   different.

   Let's consider the first case (All interfaces activates and
   simultaneously sends/receives packets at a time) and identify the
   relation between network interface and destination address.

   In the following, we assume a host with two network interfaces IF1
   and IF2 of different access technologies.  Each interface is
   configured with an IP address, respectively IP1 and IP2, and the
   address of a correspondent node is IP3.

   Because the host simultaneously use two interfaces and two interfaces
   are involved in sending/receiving packets, the routing information
   (for relation between network interface and destination address)
   could be configured as shown in the following table.  In this table,
   to send packets to IP3, there are two available network interface;
   IF1 and IF2.  The relation between network interface and destination
   address which is one-to-one mapping is changed to one(destination
   address)-to-many(network interface) mapping.  So other relevant
   routing tables and routing caches should be support this change.

   Table 1: Relation between destination address and network interfaces

   Let's consider the second case (All interfaces activates but just
   some of them sends/receives packets at a time) and identify the
   relation between network interface and destination address.  Let's
   assume that in the beginning time, IF1 is used and as time goes by,
   IF 2 is used.  At the beginning time of communication, when the host
   uses (IF1, IP1) and sends packets to a correspondent node, the source
   address and destination address of packets is (IP1, IP3) and the used
   network interface is IF1.  As time goes by and the host selects IF2
   to send/receive packets, and then the host uses (IF2, IP2) and the
   used network interface is IF2.  Before this change, the destination
   address (IP3) of the correspondent node is mapped to a network
   interface IF1.  However after this change, when an application tries
   to send packets to the correspondent node, it continually tries to
   use a network interface IF1 if the relation between destination
   address IP3 and network interface IF1 is not properly updated.  So,
   if all interfaces activates but just some of them sends/receives
   packets at a time, the proper update between network interface and
   destination address is needed.

2.2.  Consideration for asymmetric routing path

   In current network, a host can be equipped one or more network
   interfaces.  Each network interface can be assigned one or multiple
   IP address.  With this configuration, a host can connect to different
   networks and use different services at the same time.  Since a host
   usually has a node-scoped routing table, in some cases it cannot
   differentiate exactly which interface that a packet will be
   forwarded.

   We consider the following scenario: A host H1 has two network
   interfaces IF1 and IF2.  Each network interface connects to a
   specific sub-network with a corresponding IP address as showed in the
   table.

                          Table 4: Routing table

   Now we assume that there is a correspond node CN in the network N5.
   CN has only one connection with the network N2 via the gateway G2.
   Let CN send a TCP packet to H1 via the gateway G2.  When host H1
   receives this packet, it will send an ACK packet back to CN.  First
   H1 will check its routing table to find the gateway for sending ACK
   packet.  Because the routing table does not have any dedicated
   routing entry for the network N3, H1 will send ACK packet to the
   default gateway G1.  However CN does not have any connection with

   this network, the ACK packet cannot reach CN.  Thus to maintain a
   connection, the response of a packet should be routed via the same
   interface that it is received.


3.  Usage scenarios of multiple interfaces in a host

   If a host has only single network interface (or although it has
   multiple interfaces but only one interface is activated at one time)
   and it is connected to single network, the activated interface is
   established to one layer 2 entity (e.g., WLAN Access Point) and it is
   also established to one layer 3 entity (e.g., router).  It means that
   single layer 2 connection (where the single network interface is
   activated via a layer 2 entity) is only mapped to single layer 3
   connection.

   Meanwhile, if a host has multiple interfaces (or it has single
   interface and it is connected to multiple networks) and it is
   connected to multiple networks, the host may have multiple activated
   interfaces.  And each activated interface may be established to
   different layer 2 entity.  Because each layer 2 entity may be
   connected to different networks, some activated interfaces may be
   connected to global networks and some activated interfaces may be
   connected to non-global networks (e.g., private networks).  In this
   case, the one-to-one mapping between single layer 2 connection and
   single layer 3 connection is not made.  There may be various usage
   scenarios by the relation between layer 2 networks and layer 3
   networks.

3.1.  Scenario 1: A host with single I/F to single L2 network and single
      L3 network

   This scenario illustrates a host with single interface that is
   connected to single layer 2 network and single layer 3 network.  This

   This scenario illustrates a host with single interface that is
   connected to multiple layer 2 networks and single layer 3 network.
   In layer 3 operation's aspect, same link and same subnet is used.

   This scenario seems that it is not possible when we use typical layer
   2 technologies such as WLAN.  But it is acknowledged that some
   particular access technology such as CDMA makes it possible.  But, in
   real field, it is not easy to see this configuration.  Although the
   single interface is connected to multiple layer 2 entity, the host is
   connected to single layer 3 network, because the two layer 2 entities
   are connected to same router and receive same prefix information.  In
   this case, the host must properly decide which layer 2 entity should
   be used.  But, there is no issue as an aspect of MIF.

   host can have two IP addresses and two default routers.  The host
   must decide which IP address and which default router should be used
   to make proper connection.

3.7.  Scenario 7: A host with single I/F to multiple L2 networks and
      multiple L3 networks

   This scenario illustrates a host with single interface that is
   connected to multiple layer 2 networks and multiple layer 3 networks.
   Because the host is connected to different layer 2 entity and
   different router, it receives different prefix information.  So, MIF
   issues exist in this case.  The host can have two IP addresses and
   two default routers and the host must decide which IP address and
   which default router should be used.  In this case, both Router 1 and
   Router 2 are connected to public network, the host can use any
   default router to connect to public network.

   This scenario illustrates a host with multiple interfaces that are
   connected to multiple layer 2 networks and single layer 3 network.
   Although, multiple layer 2 entity is used, in layer 3 operation's
   aspect, same link and same subnet is used.  In this case, the host
   has only one prefix information and other MIF issues do not exist
   except for the choosing proper network interface.

       multiple L3 networks

   This scenario illustrates a host with multiple interfaces that are
   connected to single layer 2 networks and multiple layer 3 networks.
   Because the host is connected to different router, it receives
   different prefix information.  So, MIF issues exist in this case.

   The host can have two IP addresses and two default routers and the
   host must decide which IP address and which default router should be
   used.  In this case, both Router 1 and Router 2 are connected to
   public network, the host can use any default router to connect to
   public network.

3.15.  Remarks of analysis of usage scenarios

   It is understood that MIF working group tries to describe the issues
   of attaching to multiple networks on hosts.  In some point, it seems
   that MIF issues are not directly related to the configuration of
   layer 2 network and layer 3 network, because we are focusing on host



Hong, et al.            Expires January 14, 2010               [Page 27]

Internet-Draft           mif analysis & scenario               July 2009


   itself in MIF.  But, after we describe the usage scenarios of
   multiple interfaces, we found that there are many possible usage
   scenarios and MIF issues exist in some scenarios and do not exist in
   other scenarios.  To make effective works in MIF, we must find which
   scenario we should focus on.  The optimal MIF's goal should be worked
   with irrelevant of the network configuration of layer 2 network and
   layer 3 network.  In describing scenarios, a host with single
   interface looks like having similar MIF issues with a host with
   multiple interfaces if we assume some particular access technology
   such as CDMA.  It is needed to discuss whether MIF working group
   includes this special cases or not.


4.  Conclusions

   When a host has multiple interfaces, the host can use heterogeneous
   network interfaces and it can provide ubiquitous access.  In this
   document, we showed the issues when a host has multiple network
   interfaces as an aspect of host's operations with the focusing on
   routing issues such as source address and default router selection.
   If a host is able to use multiple interfaces simultaneously, the host
   must consider the proper mapping between network interface and
   destination address.  And the asymmetric routing path may make the
   communication fail.  In this document, we enumerate the usage
   scenarios of multiple interfaces in a host with the relation between
   layer 2 network and layer 3 network.  We hope whether which scenario
   belongs to MIF scope and identify practical problems of multiple
   interfaces in each scenario.


5.  Security Considerations

   This document doesn't intend to provide the MIF security analysis but
   one will be required.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.
