       This document discusses topics related to hierarchical and 
       stitched Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Label 
       Switched Paths (LSPs).  It describes extensions to allow an

       dynamically signaled Forwarding Adjacency LSP (FA-LSP) or as a 
       Routing Adjacency (RA). In addition, the document also discusses 
       the issue of how to indicate that an LSP should be advertised as 
       a traffic engineering (TE) link into a different instance of the 
       IGP, and how to identify the instance that should be used.

    1. Introduction and Problem Statement 

    1.1. LSP Hierarchy 

       LSP hierarchy has been developed to improve the scalability of 
       Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) by allowing 
       Label Switched Paths (LSPs) to be aggregated into a hierarchy of 
       such LSPs [RFC4206]. An LSP may be advertised as a traffic 
       engineering (TE) link for use within the same instance of the 
       control plane as was used to set up the LSP. This TE link is 
       called a Forwarding Adjacency (FA), and the LSP is known as an 
       FA-LSP. 

       [RFC4206] defines the operation as follows for a numbered FA: 

       1. The ingress signals the LSP using a /31 sender address that it 
          allocates as the source address in the signaling message 
          (tunnel sender address in the Sender Template object of the 
          Path message), and targeting the TE router ID of the egress 
          (destination address in the Sender object of the Path  
          message). 

       2. The egress sets up the LSP using normal procedures and 
          allocating the partner address of the assigned /31 address in 
          the local interface address. 

       3. The ingress then forms a Forwarding Adjacency (FA) out of that 
          LSP by advertising it as a Traffic Engineering (TE) link using 
          the routing protocol (OSPF/ISIS) and  using the /31 address to 
          identify the local end of the TE link. 

       4. When the egress receives the TE link advertisement, it checks 
          the Link-ID address of the TE advertisement against its own TE 
          Router ID.  If it matches its own TE Router ID, the egress 
          checks the advertising router ID of the TE advertisement 
          against the ingress addresses of all LSPs for which it is the 
          egress and finds the address match with the advertising router 
          ID of the TE advertisement.

       5. The egress then advertises the FA LSP as a TE link setting the 
          advertising TE Router ID in the Link-ID and the partner 
          address of the assigned /31 address in the local interface 
          address.  

       Nesting of LSPs originated by other LSRs into that LSP can be 
       achieved by using the label stack construct. 

        
    1.2. LSP advertisement and Usage 

       There are three different ways in which traffic can be forwarded 
       to  

       There are different ways in which an LSP can be used to carry 
       traffic and potentially advertised as a link by a routing 
       protocol.  
        
       First, the LSP can be used either as a link inside or outside 
       the network that was used to form the LSP. In the former case, 
       the LSP can carry traffic that could have been routed down the 
       TE links that are navigated by the LSP. In the latter case, it 
       is used by a client network, which is provided on top of the 
       network [MLN-REQ]. It can provide a new, virtual, point-to-point 
       link in a client network. The former case can only be achieved 
       in packet networks as they are the only type of network that 
       supports nesting of LSPs within the same technology LSP, but the 
       latter case is applicable to all client/server network 
       relationships such as IP over MPLS, or packet over optical.  
        
       Second, the link formed by the LSP can be advertised by the 
       routing protocol as available to carry traffic, or can be kept 
       as a private link known only to the head and tail end LSRs.  
        
       These two options give rise to four possible combinations as 
       follows.  
        
       1. The LSP is created and advertised as a TE link in the same 
       instance of the routing protocol as was used to advertise the 
       links that it traverses. This is a Forwarding Adjacency as 
       described in [RFC4206]. Note that no routing adjacency is formed 
       over the LSP.  
        
       2. The LSP is created and made available to carry traffic in the 
       same network as the links that it traverses, but it is not 
       advertised. The availability of the LSP is private to the end

       points. This is a hierarchical LSP, but not an FA. It might be 
       used for inter-domain traffic engineering [RFC4726].  
        
       3. The LSP is created as before, but is advertised as a link in 
       another instance of the routing protocol. This method of 
       operation is particular to client/server networks and especially 
       multi-layer networks [MLN-REQ], [PCE-INTER-LAYER-REQ].  
        
       4. An LSP can be created and used by a client network without 
       being advertised in the client network routing protocol. Just as 
       in case 2, the existence of the LSP as a protocol tunnel is 
       known only to the tunnel LSP points which are nodes in the 
       client network.  
        
       Notes:  
        
       a. Case 1 includes the multi-layer traffic engineering scenario 
       where a single instance of the routing protocol is used across 
       both layers. This situation was particularly envisaged in 
       [RFC4206].  
        
       b. The example cited in case 2 is special because the 
       hierarchical LSP is edge-to-edge within a particular domain and 
       no TE links are advertised outside of the domain (by definition 
       of the domain). The purpose of the TE link is to carry traffic 
       across the domain and not to carry intra-domain traffic. 
       Advertising the TE link within the domain might cause internal 
       traffic to take longer paths as it seeks to use the hierarchical 
       LSP.  
        
       c. Case 3 is not the only option for the multi-layer network as 
       explained in Note a.  
        
       d. The client network in case 3 may be a different technology TE 
       network (such as a GMPLS TDM network that operates over a GMPLS 
       WDM network, or an MPLS-TE network operating over a GMPLS 
       optical network), a same-technology TE network where LSP nesting 
       is allowed (for example, an MPLS-TE network operating over 
       another MPLS-TE network), or a non-TE network (such as an IP 
       network operating over an MPLS-TE or GMPLS network of any 
       technology). Thus, the link advertised may be a TE link, or a 
       routing link. In the second instance, the LSP is used to form a 
       virtual adjacency between two non-neighboring IP routers (a 
       Routing Adjacency - RA) forming IGP shortcuts.  
        
       e. IGP shortcuts are precluded when the LSP end-points reside

       within different IGP areas [RFC4105].  
        
       f. IGP shortcuts should be treated with extreme caution when 
       they are created and used in the same IP/MPLS network. Thus, it 
       may be more common to use them as described in case 4 and even 
       in this case, only when the egress of the LSP is the final 
       destination of the traffic carried.  
        
       g. It would be unusual although not impossible to use a 
       hierarchical LSP as an IGP shortcut within the control plane. 

    1.3. Problem Statement 

       The extensions described in this document are intended for 
       dynamically signaled bi-directional Forwarding Adjacency LSPs 
       (FA-LSPs). In particular this document addresses the following 
       points: 

         (1) How to let the egress node know that this bi-directional 
            LSP needs to be advertised as an FA, or as an RA, or as an  
            FA and RA or is a local virtual link only for the use of  
            the ingress and egress nodes.  

         (2) How to indicate that a new LSP should be treated as part of 
            a TE link bundle and advertised as part of that bundle. 

         (3) How to identify the routing instance in which such an 
            advertisement should happen.  

       We should note that these aspects are equally applicable to both 
       numbered and unnumbered TE links. 
       In order for the egress of an LSP to be able to advertise the 
       LSP as a TE link it needs to know that such an advertisement is 
       desirable, and it also needs to know the TE Router ID of the 
       ingress LSR. (Please recall that the Router ID of the other end 
       of the link is set in the Link-ID sub-TLV of the Link TLV of the 
       TE Opaque-LSA [RFC3630].) If the LSP is to form part of a TE 
       link bundle, the egress must also know the identity of the 
       bundle. 

       When the mechanism set out in section 1.1 is used for numbered 
       FAs, there is no way to carry the TE Router ID of the ingress 
       LSR in the RSVP signaling message (Path message) and there is no 
       way to indicate that the new LSP is to be used as an FA LSP. 
       Therefore the egress LSR has to wait to receive a routing 
       protocol advertisement of the TE link flooded by the ingress to 

     
     
    Shiomoto                 Expires August 2008               [Page 6] 
        
    Internet-Draft  draft-ietf-ccamp-lsp-hierarchy-bis-03  Feburuary 2008 


       learn about the new TE link and to deduce that the LSP forms 
       that TE link. The egress must learn the TE Router ID of the 
       ingress node before it can advertise the FA as described in 
       Section 1.2. Note further, that in this approach, the egress LSR 
       must search potentially many LSPs every time it receives an 
       advertisement for a new TE link. 

       [RFC3477] defines a different method for the exchange of 
       information in the signaling protocol during the establishment 
       of LSPs that will be advertised as unnumbered TE links.  If the 
       LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID object is present, it indicates that the 
       LSP is to be advertised as a TE link, and it contains the TE 
       Router ID of the ingress LSR.  This mechanism resolves many of 
       the issues listed above, and provides a solution for unnumbered 
       TE links, however, the LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID object cannot be 
       used for numbered FAs as currently defined, and so the problem 
       remains for numbered TE links.  

       Related to the above problem, a few key observations are worth 
       noting: 

       6. The term FA is applicable only when an LSP is created and used 
          as a TE link in the same instance of the IGP.  [RFC4206] did 
          not consider scenarios where an LSP is created (and 
          maintained) by one instance of the IGP, and is used as a (TE) 
          link by another instance of IGP. This leaves open the question 
          of advertising a TE link into a different instance of the IGP 
          as is needed in multi-region/multi-layer networks [MLN-REQ], 
          and how to identify which instance of the IGP should be used. 
          In addition, the TE link advertised into the different IGP 
          instance may be associated with an IGP neighbor adjacency. We 
          call it a routing adjacency (RA). The decision as to whether 
          the link should be advertised to MPLS TE topology or IP 
          topology or both depends on operator policy. Therefore, a 
          mechanism to indicate the choice to the Egress node is needed. 

       7. [RFC4206] provides a way to exchange numbered identifiers for 
          the TE link, but this does not clearly state that the Ingress 
          node can use presence of the LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID object as 
          a trigger for TE link advertisement at the egress node.

       8. It is important to note that an LSP that is set up in a server 
          GMPLS transport network and advertised as a TE link in a 
          client MPLS data network is NOT an FA-LSP according to the 
          definitions explained in point 1, above. This is the case 
          regardless of whether the GMPLS network is packet- or non-
          packet-capable. 

       9. When an egress checks the address of the advertised TE link to 
          find the LSP sender (Recall step (4) as described in section 
          1.1), it must check the Link-ID address of all received TE 
          advertisements against its own TE Router ID.  If it matches 
          its own TE Router ID, the egress checks the advertising router 
          ID of the TE advertisement against the ingress addresses of 
          all LSPs for which it is the egress.  It is an assertion of 
          the authors that this method is not scalable due to the amount 
          of processing needed for all the TE Link State Advertisements 
          (LSAs). 

       10.Further, if a set of LSPs are to be bundled into a single TE 
       link [RFC4201] then not only is it necessary to identify to the 
       egress that the LSP will be advertised as part of a TE link, it 
       is also necessary to indicate the identity of the TE link. This 
       identity is distinct from the identity of the component link. 
       Thus, in this case an additional identifier needs to be signaled, 
       but none is currently available. 

    1.4. Current Approaches and Shortcomings 

       [RFC3477] provides a mechanism to exchange unnumbered 
       identifiers for the TE link during FA-LSP establishment, and 
       this can be used as a notification to the egress that the LSP 
       will be used as a TE link. So, for unnumbered TE links, there is 
       a well-defined indication available, and this could be 
       documented and used as a trigger for TE link advertisement by 
       the egress.   

       The use of unnumbered TE links may be arguably more sensible 
       than assigning numbers to FAs, especially in the case of large 
       networks.  Some operators though prefer to consistently use 
       numbered TE links for both static and dynamic (that is, FA) TE 
       links in their networks. In the case of numbered TE links, 
       however, there is no available indication to allow the egress to 
       know that an LSP should be advertised as a TE link. 

       In addition, using unnumbered TE links does not address the 
       issue of advertising TE links into a different instance of the

       IGP. There is no defined mechanism to identify whether it should 
       be advertised as an FA, a full Routing Adjacency (RA), or it 
       should be used as a local virtual link. 

       The Link Management Protocol (LMP) [RFC4204] could possibly be 
       run on remote adjacencies between the endpoints of an LSP.  But 
       LMP peer discovery would be required for dynamic LMP peering and 
       is not currently specified.  In addition, the concept of a 
       remote LMP adjacency remains unproven.  Lastly, there would be a 
       requirement that all layers/regions in a MLN network run LMP.  
       This may not be the case in existing networks and would put 
       undue burden on the network operator to deploy another protocol. 

    1.5. Contents of This Document 

       This document provides a consolidated way of exchanging TE link 
       identifiers when an LSP is established through signaling. It 
       also provides a mechanism to allow the ingress to control 
       whether, and into which IGP instances, an LSP is advertised as 
       an FA and/ or RA by the egress. The proposed mechanism applies 
       equally to Hierarchical LSPs (H-LSPs) and Stitchable LSPs (S-
       LSPs).   

       The method described below extends the method described in 
       [RFC3477], which is applied for an FA-LSP represented as an 
       unnumbered TE link.

    3. Proposed Solution 

       The following method allows the ingress and egress LSRs to 
       exchange the link addresses or link identifiers (including the 
       node ID) of the ends of a numbered or unnumbered TE link to be 
       formed from an LSP.  It is an extension of the procedures 
       defined in [RFC3477] for unnumbered TE links. 

       If an ingress LSR that originates an LSP, intends to advertise 
       this LSP as a TE link in IS-IS or OSPF [RFC4206], the ingress 
       LSR MUST allocate an address or identifier to the TE link (just 
       like for any other TE link), and it MUST do this before the LSP 
       setup request is signaled.  Moreover, the Path message used for 
       establishing the LSP that will be used to form the TE link MUST 
       contain the LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID object (as extended and 
       described below), with the interface address or identifier 
       allocated by the ingress LSR. 

       If the Path message for the H-LSP/S-LSP contains the 
       LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID object, then the egress LSR (assuming it 
       accepts the LSP request) MUST allocate an address or identifier 
       to the TE link that will be formed (just like for any other 
       numbered or unnumbered TE link).  Furthermore, the Resv message 
       for the LSP MUST contain an LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID object, with 
       the interface address or identifier allocated by the egress LSR. 

       In all cases where an LSP is to be advertised as a TE link, the 
       Tunnel Sender Address in the Sender Template Object of the Path 
       message MUST be set to the TE Router ID of the ingress LSR. We 
       should note that this is a change from the method described in 
       [RFC4206].  

       Once the egress LSR has successfully sent a Resv message as 
       described above it SHOULD advertise the LSP as a TE link using 
       the addresses/identifiers exchanged. Once the Resv has been 
       processed by the ingress LSR and the LSP has been successfully 
       established, the ingress LSR SHOULD advertise the LSP as a TE 
       link using the addresses/identifiers exchanged.

       Once the TE link advertisement has been flooded it is available 
       for use in path computation and LSP signaling just like any 
       other TE link. 

    3.1. IGP Instance Identification 

       The mechanism described so far allows an ingress LSR to indicate 
       that an LSP is to be used as a TE link and allows the ingress 
       and egress LSRs to exchange addresses or identifiers for that TE 
       link, during LSP setup. 

       However, it is also necessary to indicate into which instance of 
       the IGP the advertisement should be made.  This is only 
       necessary if the LSP is to be advertised as a TE link into a 
       different instance of the IGP, and the default behavior may 
       safely be left with the LSP advertised into the same instance of 
       the IGP. 

       Indication of the IGP in which the advertisement is to be made 
       first requires that a 32-bit identifier be assigned to each of 
       the IGP instances within a network, and that ingress and egress 
       LSRs have the same understanding of these numbers.  This is a 
       management configuration exercise outside the scope of this 
       document. 

       Once these numbers have been assigned, they MAY be signaled as 
       additional information in the LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID object to 
       indicate to which instance of the IGP the object applies.   

       The IGP instance identifier value of 0xffffffff is reserved to 
       indicate that the TE link SHOULD be advertised into the same 
       instance of the IGP as was used to establish the LSP.  Similarly, 
       absence of the IGP instance identifier means that an FA is to be 
       established (in the same IGP instance).  

    3.2. LSP advertisement and Usage Identification 

       As mentioned earlier, the egress node also needs to know if it 
       needs to create a full routing adjacency or forwarding adjacency 
       or just need to treat the LSP as a local virtual link. The 
       extensions defined in the following also specify the LSP 
       advertisement and usage treatment.  





     
     
    Shiomoto                 Expires August 2008              [Page 11]

       It is not mutually exclusive whether the LSP has routing 
       adjacency and whether it has forwarding adjacency. The LSP can 
       have both routing and forwarding adjacency. In this case, the LSP 
       can be used to carry both pure IP datagram packets and MPLS 
       labeled packets. If the LSP has only forwarding adjacency, it is 
       used as TE-link to carry only MPLS labeled packets. If the LSP 
       has only routing adjacency, it is used as IP link to carry only 
       pure IP datagram packets. 
       Note that the LSP which has only forwarding adjacency is useful 
       to improve the scalability. Suppose that distant PSC domains are 
       connected by a set of lower-layer LSPs created in the optical 
       domain (TDM, LSC, or FSC). We do not require routing adjacency on 
       all such lower-layer LSPs as long as we have control plane 
       connectivity through a subset of lower-layer LSPs which have 
       routing adjacency. We reduce the amount of overhead of IGP 
       protocol processing on the LSPs which do not have routing 
       adjacency. 
       It is mutually exclusive whether the LPS has routing adjacency 
       and whether it is treated as a local virtual link. Likewise, it 
       is mutually exclusive whether the LSP has forwarding adjacency 
       and whether it is treated as a local virtual link. 
        
    3.3. Bundling 

       It is possible to treat LSPs as component links and to bundle 
       them into a single TE link. However there is currently no way to 
       signal that an LSP will be used as part of a bundle and to 
       identify the bundled link to which the LSP is supposed to belong. 

       Each LSP that is to form a component link is signaled using the 
       LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID object to identify the TE link bundle to 
       which the LSP will belong.  Thus multiple LSPs may be signaled 
       with the same address/identifier in the LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID 
       object.  When the LSP is to form a component link, the 
       LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID object MUST also contain an additional 
       TLV to identify the component link.  This may be a numbered or 
       unnumbered identifier. 

       Multiple LSPs may be signaled with the same address/identifier 
       in the LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID object.   

        
    3.4. LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID Object 

       The LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID object defined in [RFC3477] has a 
       class number of 193, which designates that a node that does not

       understand the object SHOULD ignore the object but forward it, 
       unexamined and unmodified, in all messages resulting from this 
       message. 

       [RFC3477] defines one class type to indicate an unnumbered 
       interface identifier.  This document defines three new class 
       types as follows. 

       C-Type               Meaning                                
       Reference 
       ---------------------------------------------------------------- 
        1                Unnumbered interface identifier      [RFC3477] 
        2 (TBD by IANA)  IPv4 interface identifier with target    2.2.2 
        3 (TBD by IANA)  IPv6 interface identifier with target    2.2.3 
        4 (TBD by IANA)  Unnumbered interface with target         2.2.4 
          
       Multiple instances of the LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID object with C-
       Type values 2, 3 or 4 MAY appear in any one Path or Resv message, 
       in which case, each MUST have a different value for the Target 
       IGP Instance field.  A Path or Resv message MUST NOT contain 
       more than one instance of the LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID object 
       with C-Type 1, and if such an object is present, other instances 
       of the object with any other C-Type value MUST NOT have Target 
       IGP Instance set to 0xffffffff. 

    3.4.1. Unnumbered link 

       The unnumbered link identifier defined by [RFC3477] is not 
       changed by this document.  Its usage also remains the same.  
       That is, when present in a Path message it indicates that the 
       LSP being established SHOULD be advertised by the egress LSR as 
       a TE link, and that unnumbered link identifier is the ingress' 
       identifier for the TE link. 

       Note that since this form of the object does not contain a 
       target IGP instance identifier it cannot identify a specific 
       instance of the IGP into which this TE link should be advertised. 
       Similarly, LSP advertisement and usage treatment also needs to 
       be specified. Thus, when C-Type 1 is used, the TE link SHOULD be 
       advertised only into the same instance of the IGP as was used to 
       create the LSP.  That is, the use of C-Type 1 is unchanged from 
       [RFC3477] and is used to create an unnumbered Forwarding 
       Adjacency. 

       This object can appear in either a Path message or a Resv 
       message.  In the former case, we call it the "Forward Interface

       ID" for that LSP; in the latter case, we call it the "Reverse 
       Interface ID" for the LSP. 

       A Path or Resv message MUST have only one instance of this 
       object with C-Type 1. 

    3.4.2. IPv4 numbered link 

       A new C-Type variant of the LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID Object is 
       defined to carry an IPv4 numbered interface address and to 
       indicate into which instance of the IGP the consequent TE link 
       should be advertised. 

       The format of the object is as shown below.

       topology. We should note that it assures the backward 
       compatibility with the method to exchange unnumbered FA 
       information described in [RFC3477].

       "0001": LSP is an RA and is only advertised into the IP network.  
       "0010": LSP is an RA and FA and is advertised in both IP and 
       MPLS-TE topologies.  
       "0011": LSP is neither the FA nor RA and is to be used as a local 
       virtual link. In this case the LSP is advertised neither in IP 
       nor MPLS topology.  
       The Padding MUST be set to zero on transmission, SHOULD be 
       ignored and forwarded unchanged, and SHOULD be ignored on  
       receipt. 
       This object can appear in either a Path message or a Resv 
       message.  In the former case, we call it the "Forward Interface 
       Address" for that LSP; in the latter case, we call it the 
       "Reverse Interface Address" for the LSP.

       A new C-Type variant of the LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID Object is 
       defined to carry an IPv6 numbered interface address and to

       [RFC3477] does not state where in the Path message or Resv

       Since [RFC3209] states that all implementations are to handle 
       all objects received in any order, this is not a problem. 
       However, it is RECOMMENDED that the LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID 
       object(s) be placed in the Path message immediately after the 
       SENDER_TSPEC object, and in the Resv message immediately after 
       the FILTER_SPEC object.

       The length field contains the total length of the TLV including 
       the Type and Length fields in bytes A value field whose length 
       is not a multiple of four MUST be zero-padded so that the TLV is 
       four-byte aligned. 

       This document defines two Type values to be used to specify the 
       component link identifier that the sending LSR has assigned to 
       the LSP if it forms part of a TE link bundle.  The consequent 
       TLV formats are shown in the next sections. 

    3.5.1. Unnumbered Component Link Identifier 

        0                   1                   2                   3

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
        

       This TLV is present if the signaled LSP is to be used as an 
       unnumbered component link of a bundled TE link.  In this case, 
       the identifier (numbered or unnumbered) in the main body of the 
       LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID object indicates the TE link bundle of 
       which this LSP is a component, and the Component Link Identifier 
       of this TLV specifies the unnumbered identifier that is assigned 
       to this component link within the bundle.

       This TLV MUST NOT be present in the same instance of the 
       LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID object as a TLV with type 2 (numbered 
       component link identifier). 

    3.5.2. IPv4 Numbered Component Link Identifier 

        0                   1                   2                   3

       |           Type = 2            |          Length = 8           | 
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
       |                     IPv4 Address (32 bits)                    | 
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
        

       This TLV is present if the signaled LSP is to be used as a 
       numbered component link of a bundled TE link.  In this case, the 
       identifier (numbered or unnumbered) in the main body of the 
       LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID object indicates the TE link bundle of 
       which this LSP is a component, and the IPv4 Address field of 
       this TLV specifies the numbered identifier that is assigned to 
       this component link within the bundle. 

       This TLV MUST NOT be present in the same instance of the 
       LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID object as a TLV with type 1 (unnumbered 
       component link identifier). 

        
    3.6. LSA advertisement 

       The ingress and egress LSRs MAY advertise link state associated 
       with TE links created as described above.  The link state may be 
       advertised in either the same IGP instance as used to compute 
       and signal the path for the LSPs that support the TE links, or 
       another IGP instance.  In the former case, the address space for 
       the link state MUST be the same as that used to establish the 
       LSPs.  In the latter case, the address space for the link state 
       MAY be different, which means that addresses already allocated 
       in the IGP instance used to establish the LSPs MAY be used by 
       the advertised TE link without any ambiguity. 

       In the IGP the TE Router ID of the ingress LSR is taken from the 
       Tunnel Sender Address in the Sender Template object.  It is 
       assumed that the ingress LSR knows the TE Router ID of the 
       egress LSR since it has chosen to establish an LSP to that LSR 
       and plans to use the LSP as a TE link.

       The link interface addresses or link interface identifiers for 
       the forward and reverse direction links are taken from the 
       LSP_TUNNEL_INTREFACE_ID object on the Path and Resv messages 
       respectively. 

       Address overlap checking for these objects MUST be turned off 
       when the LSA is advertised into a IGP instance different from 
       the one used to establish the LSP because the addresses MAY be 
       allocated in both domains. 

    4. Applicability Statement 

       The method is applicable for both hierarchical LSPs [RFC4206] 
       and LSP stitching [STITCH]. 

    5. Backward Compatibility Considerations 

       The method does not impact the method to exchange unnumbered FA 
       information described in [RFC3477].  That mechanism can be 
       safely used in combination with the new mechanisms described 
       here and is functionally equivalent to using the new C-Type 
       indicating an unnumbered link with target IGP instance 
       identifier with the Target IGP Instance value set to 0xffffffff. 

       This method obsoletes the method to exchange the numbered FA 
       information described in [RFC4206].  This is not believed to be 
       an issue as an informal survey indicated that dynamically 
       signaled numbered FAs had not been deployed.  Indeed it was the 
       attempt to implement numbered FAs that gave rise to the work on 
       this document. 

    6. Security Considerations 

       [RFC3477] points out that one can argue that the use of the 
       extra interface identifier that it provides could make an RSVP 
       message harder to spoof.  In that respect, the minor extensions 
       to the protocol made in this document do not constitute an 
       additional security risk, but could also be said to improve 
       security. 

       It should be noted that the ability of an ingress LSR to request 
       that an egress LSR advertise an LSP as a TE link MUST be subject 
       to appropriate policy checks at the egress LSR.  That is, the 
       egress LSR MUST NOT automatically accept the word of the ingress 
       unless it is configured with such a policy.

    7. IANA Considerations 

       This document defines three new C-Types for the 
       LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID object.  The C-Types for this object are 
       managed by IANA, and IANA is requested to assign values to the 
       new C-Types as tabulated in section 2.2 and described in 
       sections 2.2.2, 2.2.3 and 2.2.4.
