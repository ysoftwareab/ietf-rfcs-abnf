1.  Introduction

   Rate pacing is a class of network traffic shaping which limits the
   transmission rate of data over a network.  In the context of a
   Content Delivery Network (CDN), rate pacing provides an important
   business advantage to a Content Service Provider (CSP) by ensuring
   that a CDN which is delivering content on behalf of that CSP does not
   deliver significantly more data than necessary to an end client.

   For example, suppose an end client is watching some Constant Bit Rate
   (CBR) video encoded at 1500 kbps.  In the absence of rate pacing, the
   CDN delivering this content may send it to the client at 3000 kbps.
   If the client chooses to terminate the session before watching the
   entire video, up to half the transmitted data is wasted.  This waste
   leads to unnecessary cost for the CSP and diminished useful capacity
   for the CDN.

   Rate pacing requires configuration on a per-content basis.  In order
   to enable rate pacing in a CDNI environment, the CDNI interfaces need
   to be extended to optionally support this feature.

   This document describes:

   1.  CDNI interface extensions required for supporting rate pacing

   2.  a token bucket rate pacing algorithm for CDNs

2.  CDNI Interfaces Impact

2.1.  Footprint & Capabilities Interface

   [I-D.ietf-cdni-footprint-capabilities-semantics]defines the CDNI
   Footprint and Capabilities semantics.  But at the time of writing, no
   FCI syntax specification has been accepted as a working group
   document.

   [I-D.ietf-cdni-footprint-capabilities-semantics]states that:

   "The CDNI FCI specification SHOULD define the registry (and the rules
   for adding new entries to the registry) for the different capability
   types.  Each capability type MAY further have a list of valid values.
   The individual CDNI interface specifications which define a given
   capability SHOULD define any necessary registries (and the rules for
   adding new entries to the registry) for the values advertised for a
   given capability type."

   This document defines a new capability type: "RatePacing" to be added
   to the FCI capability types registry.  The value of this capability
   contains one or more rate pacing algorithm names from the Rate Pacing
   algorithms registry (Section 4.1).  For example, the value may be
   "token-bucket/v1" to indicate that the advertising CDN supports the
   token bucket algorithm described later in this document.

   A CDN MAY advertise the "RatePacing" capability in the FCI if it
   implements this specification and at least one rate pacing algorithm
   registered in the Rate Pacing algorithms registry.

2.2.  Metadata Interface

   A new RatePacing metadata object is defined to represent the
   configuration for rate pacing.  The RatePacing object has MIME type
   "application/cdni.RatePacing.v1".  RatingPacing MAY appear within the
   metadata list of either HostMetadata or PathMetadata (i.e.  may have
   either host-level scope or a path-level scope).  The following
   section defines the properties of the RatingPacing object.

2.2.1.  RatePacing Metadata

   The presence of the RatePacing Metadata indicates that a dCDN MUST
   comply with this specification in order to deliver a piece of
   content.  The metadata indicates the rate pacing algorithm name



Caulfield                Expires August 15, 2014                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft              CDNI Rate Pacing               February 2014


   required for delivering the content and the relevant parameters for
   that algorithm.

      Property: algo

         Description: Rate pacing algorithm name from the Rate Pacing
         Algorithms registry.  Dictates the structure of the "params"
         value.  For example, "token-bucket./v1".

         Type: String

         Mandatory-to-Specify: Yes.

      Property: params

         Description: An object containing algorithm-specific properties
         and values which are relevant to the rate pacing algorithm
         specified by the "algo" property.  Each algorithm dictates its
         own parameters.

         Type: Object

         Mandatory-to-Specify: Yes.

2.3.  Request Routing Redirection Interface

   The RRI is not impacted by rate pacing.  However, if the metadata for
   a piece of content indicates that rate pacing is required by the
   uCDN, then a request router should only redirect requests for that
   content to CDNs which advertise "RatePacing" as a capability.  The
   request router should also limit its choice of dCDNs to those which
   advertise the same rate pacing algorithm as is specified by the rate
   pacing metadata.

   For example, if the metadata for a piece of content includes a
   GenericMetadata object of type "application/cdni.RatePacing.v1" and
   the "algo" property in the value of that GenericMetadata is "token-
   bucket/v1", then the request router of the uCDN should only redirect
   requests for that piece of content to dCDNs which advertise a
   capability type of "RatePacing" and a capability value of "token-
   bucket/v1".

2.4.  Logging Interface

   The rate at which a piece of content was delivered MAY be indicated
   via the LI.  The "sc-rate" field indicates the rate in bytes per
   second as a decimal number.  The bytes measured should correspond to
   the sc-entity-bytes field.

      sc-rate:

         format: DEC

         field value: the average rate in bytes per second at which a
         response was delivered from Surrogate to client.

         occurence: there MUST be zero or exactly one instances of this
         field.

   Note that existing fields defined by [I-D.ietf-cdni-logging] include
   the bytes delivered and the time taken to service a request.
   However, the time taken includes the acquisition latency which is not
   relevant to rate pacing.

2.5.  Control Interface

   The CI is not impacted by rate pacing.

3.  Rate Pacing Algorithm

   Token bucket is one example of a rate pacing algorithm.  This
   document extends the CDNI interfaces with generic support for rate
   pacing and registers token bucket as a rate pacing algorithm for
   CDNI.  Other algorithms MAY be defined but are beyond the scope of
   this document.  Token bucket is described by [RFC1363].

   The token bucket algorithm is characterized by two parameters:

   1.  Rate - the number of tokens added to the bucket per second

   2.  Size - the maximum number of tokens in the bucket

   For the purpose of this document, each token represents one byte.

   The algorithm name "token-bucket/v1" is registered as a Rate Pacing
   algorithm.  This algorithm name may appear as the value of the
   "RatePacing" capability.  This name may also appear as the value of
   the "algo" property in the "RatePacing" metadata object.

   If a RatePacing metadata object's "algo" value is "token-bucket/v1"
   then the metadata object's "params" is an object of type
   TokenBucketParams, described below.

3.1.  TokenBucketParams Object

      Property: rate

         Description: Rate of tokens per second to be added to the
         bucket as described by the token bucket algorithm.  This value
         MUST be a positive integer.  Each token represents one byte.

         Type: Integer

         Mandatory-to-Specify: Yes.

      Property: size

         Description: Maximum number of tokens per bucket as described
         by the token bucket algorithm.  This value MUST be a positive
         integer.

         Type: Integer

         Mandatory-to-Specify: Yes.

3.2.  Token Bucket Metadata Example

   {
       "metadata": [
       {
         "type": "application/cdni.RatePacing.v1",
         "value": {
           "algo": "token-bucket/v1",
           "params": {
             "rate": 100000,
             "size": 25000
           }
         }
       }
     ]
   }

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests the following of IANA:

   Addition of RatePacing in the CDNI Capability Registry defined in
   TBD.

   Addition of "RatePacing" to the standard partition of the CDNI
   GenericMetadata Type Registry defined in [I-D.ietf-cdni-metadata]:

          +------------+---------------+---------+------+------+

   Addition of "sc-rate" in the CDNI Logging Field Names Registry
   defined in [I-D.ietf-cdni-logging].

4.1.  CDNI Rate Pacing Algorithms Registry

   IANA is requested to create new registry, CDNI Rate Pacing
   Algorithms.  The following table defines the initial values of the
   registry:

               +----------------+---------------+---------+
               | Algorithm Name | Specification | Version |
               +----------------+---------------+---------+
               | token-bucket   | RFCthis       | 1       |
               +----------------+---------------+---------+

   New rate pacing algorithm registrations SHOULD specify RatePacing
   parameter objects as shown in Section 3.1 and SHOULD describe the
   algorithm for rate pacing.

5.  Security Considerations

   A malicious CSP might attempt to use rate pacing to instruct a dCDN
   to delivery some content at a very low rate thereby in order to
   exhaust the resources of a dCDN by forcing connection state to be
   maintained for longer than usual.  The decision to enforce a rate is
   left to the discretion of a dCDN.  An implementation of rate pacing
   should implement reasonable lower (and upper) bounds to avoid such
   cases.
