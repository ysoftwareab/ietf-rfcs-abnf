Abstract 

   The Softwire Mesh Framework provides a solution for intra-Autonomous 
   System (AS) softwire, but not inter-AS softwire. The ability to 
   provide inter-AS softwire extends the benefits of softwire to a 
   larger scale. Indeed, the above Framework discusses the possibility 
   of inter-AS softwire, but does not provide a solution. This document 
   defines a specific BGP Extended Community attribute called the 
   Tunnel Endpoint Extended Community, which allows for inter-AS 
   softwire.

1. Terminology 

   This document uses the terms defined in [RFC2663] e.g., "I-IP" 
   (Internal IP), "E-IP" (External IP) and "AFBR" (Address Family 
   Border Router). Below are terms specific to this document: 

   - Non-AFBR ASBR: a special AFBR which only needs to operate E-IP 
   control plane, but not E-IP date-plane. That's to say, on the 
   control plane, the non-AFBR ASBR MUST be dual-stack and support 
   extended MP-BGP for softwire signalling, on the data plane, it only 
   supports I-IP address family. 

2. Problem Statement 

   The Softwire Mesh Framework [RFC5565] mainly discusses softwire mesh 
   solution for intra-AS scenario, where a "transit core" consists of a 
   single Autonomous System (AS). The ability to provide inter-AS 
   softwire extends the benefits of intra-AS softwire, namely that I-IP 
   P routers do not need to operate the E-IP protocol (routing and 
   forwarding), to a larger scale. For example, an operator who owns 
   multiple ASes could form Inter-AS softwire mesh in its network.  

   In the Softwire Mesh Framework [RFC5565], three options are 
   suggested to deal with the inter-AS scenario: 

     a) Don't do it; require AFBRs to be deployed at the edge of each AS 
        so that a transit core does not extend to more than one AS. 

     b) Use multi-hop eBGP to allow AFBRs to send BGP routes to each 
        other, even if the ABFRs are not in the same or in neighboring 
        ASes. 

     c) Ensure that an Autonomous System Border Router (ASBR) that is 
        not an AFBR does not change the next-hop field of the routes for 
        which encapsulation is needed. 

   In option a, forwarding performance is reduced due to the extra 
   tunneling/detunneling operations on each AS edges.  

   In option b, AFBRs would have to afford to have the number of BGP 
   neighbors implied by inter-AS full mesh. Hence it is not scalable. 

   In option c, all those non-AFBR ASBRs would have to be upgraded to 
   support this particular capability. Besides, this option is a 
   substantial departure from the existing BGP control plane. Since BGP

   requires that the IGP have routes to all possible BGP next-hops, 
   this approach increases the load on the IGP in unpredictable ways, 
   and weakens the separation between IGP and BGP. 

3. Inter-AS Softwire Mesh Solution 

   This document suggests an alternative approach for inter-AS softwire 
   mesh which follows the "spirit" of approach 3 that tunneling 
   operations are not required on every AS edge. However, it uses a new 
   extended community attribute called Tunnel Endpoint Extended 
   Community, to carry the tunnel endpoint address (i.e., I-IP address 
   of the AFBR). In contrast to approach 3, this approach fits much 
   better into current BGP operation because it doesn't change the 
   semantics of the BGP next-hop field. Besides, there is no need to 
   upgrade non-AFBR ASBRs in the middle ASes since the extended 
   communities attribute is a transitive optional BGP attribute.

   In a scenario as shown in Figure 1, the Tunnel Endpoint Extended 
   Community works as follows: AFBR R11 for instance would advertise an 
   IPv6 prefix for Client Network CN1 in a BGP update, and attach a 
   Tunnel Endpoint Extended Community conveying its own IPv4 address to 
   the update. This attribute would be carried along BGP until it 
   reaches AFBR R32. AFBR R32 would then learn to forward IPv6 packets 
   destined for CN1 to AFBR R11 using an IPv4 tunnel. 

   Given that the non-AFBR ASBRs never actually forward IPv6 packets, 
   it is entirely possible to FIB-suppress the IPv6 prefixes so as to 
   isolate FIB size from the routing table growth in IPv6. It could 
   also be done for instance by implementing IPv6 forwarding capability 
   in software only, or by having no IPv6 forwarding capability at all.  
   This mode of operation reduces the hardware costs of those non-AFBR 
   ASBRs since they do not need to accommodate high-performance IPv6 
   forwarding in hardware, or accommodate IPv6 forwarding at all.

   In some special scenario where the transit core contains some E-IP 
   AS domains, as shown in Figure 2, to avoid stacked tunneling, once 
   the E-IP route enters an E-IP AS domain, the Tunnel Endpoint 
   Extended Community associated with the E-IP routes MUST be removed 
   by the AFBR. For example, R12 MUST remove the Tunnel Endpoint 
   Extended Community from the E-IP routes for CN1 before advertising 
   them to R21 through E-IP BGP sessions. 

   When multiple specific routes with different tunnel endpoint 
   addresses are aggregated, the aggregating router MUST attach a 
   Tunnel Endpoint Extended Community with its own address as the 
   tunnel endpoint to the aggregated route. Note that the aggregating 
   router MUST be an AFBR because it advertises itself as the tunnel 
   endpoint. 

   Where the tunnel type and/or additional tunnel parameters (i.e. for 
   GRE or L2TP) MUST be signaled, the mechanisms defined in [RFC5512] 
   could be used to signal these parameters. The two approaches for 
   tunnel signaling including the Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute and 
   the BGP Encapsulation Extended Community work well in inter-AS 
   scenario since these two attributes are transitive across ASes. 

4. Syntax of the Tunnel Endpoint Extended Community 

   This document proposes a new IPv4 address specific extended 
   community attribute [RFC4360] and a new IPv6 address specific 
   extended community attribute [RFC5701] respectively to be used as 
   the Tunnel Endpoint Extended Community for IPv6-over-IPv4 scenario 
   and IPv4-over-IPv6 scenario respectively. The value of the high-
   order octet for the IPv4 type field is 0x01 and for the IPv6 type 
   field it is 0x00 since the Tunnel Endpoint Extended Community MUST 
   be transitive across ASes. The value of the low-order octet for the 
   type field (i.e. the Sub-Type) is (TBD by IANA) for IPv4 and (TBD by 
   IANA) for IPv6. The Global Administrator field is set to the Tunnel 
   Endpoint address (i.e., one of the egress AFBR's I-IP addresses 
   which are routable in the transit network). The Local Administrator 
   field is set to zero and ignored upon receipt.  

5. Summary of Inter-AS Softwire Rules 

     a) All AFBRs MUST attach the Tunnel Endpoint Extended Community to 
        E-IP routes that enter the I-IP network domain. 

     b) All AFBRs MUST remove the Tunnel Endpoint Extended Community 
        associated to E-IP routes that enter the E-IP network domain.

Internet-Draft   Simple Tunnel Endpoint Signaling in BGP     March 2011 
 
     c) If an AFBR selects a route associated with a Tunnel Endpoint 
        Extended Community as the best path, then the AFBR MUST tunnel 
        packets matching that route towards the tunnel endpoint address 
        associated with that route. 

     d) Non-AFBR ABSRs SHOULD NOT remove the Tunnel Endpoint Extended 
        Community from the route update. 

     e) When aggregating two or more specific routes with different 
        Tunnel Endpoint Extended Communities into an aggregated route, 
        the aggregating router MUST strip the original Tunnel Endpoint 
        Extended Communities, and attach its own Tunnel Endpoint 
        Extended Community to the aggregated route. 

6. Security Considerations 

   If an AFBR chooses to disregard the I-IP tunnel route when selecting 
   the E-IP route, then the AS path taken by a packet may be different 
   from the AS path used to select the route.  This, however, SHOULD 
   rarely if ever result in a security violation per se.  It would 
   require that for some reason the security policy for selecting I-IP 
   paths and E-IP paths to be different and incompatible.  An AS can 
   avoid this security issue either by having compatible security 
   policies for both E-IP and I-IP routes, or by taking into account 
   the I-IP tunnel route when selecting the E-IP route. 

   The mechanisms described in the security considerations of the 
   Softwire Mesh Framework [RFC5565] apply to the inter-domain softwire 
   described here.  

7. IANA Considerations 

   A new Sub-Type of the Address Specific BGP Extended Communities 
   Attribute of IPv4 and IPv6 respectively SHOULD be issued by IANA for 
   the Tunnel Endpoint Extended Community as described in Section 2.
