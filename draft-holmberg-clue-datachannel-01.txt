Abstract

   This document specifies how to use the Stream Control Transmission
   Protocol (SCTP) on top of the Datagram Transport Layer Security
   (DTLS) protocol (SCTPoDTLS) for transporting CLUE protocol messages
   between CLUE entities.

   The document describes the SCTP considerations for CLUE, and the SDP
   Offer/Answer procedures for negotiating a SCTPoDTLS connection for
   CLUE.

   Details and procedures associated with the CLUE protocol are outside
   the scope of this document.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

   CLUE data channel refers to the SCTPoDTLS association that is used
   between two CLUE entities in order to transport CLUE messages.

   CLUE message refers to a CLUE protocol message that is sent over the
   CLUE data channel.

   CLUE entity refers to a SIP User Agent (UA) device that supports the
   CLUE mechanism (including the CLUE protocol).

   [RFC4960] defines a SCTP stream as a unidirectional logical channel
   established from one to another associated SCTP endpoint, within
   which all user messages are delivered in sequence except for those
   submitted to the unordered delivery service.

   [RFC4960] defines a SCTP identifier as a unsigned integer, which
   identifies an SCTP stream.

3.  Usage of SCTPoDTLS in the CLUE Context

3.1.  General

   This section defines the CLUE data channel, and describes the SCTP
   features and extensions used to realize it.

   The CLUE data channel realization, and set of SCTP features, are
   based on the the RTCWEB data channel defined in
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel].  This will allow CLUE entities to be
   interoperable with entities implementing
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel].

3.2.  CLUE Data Channel Definition

   The CLUE data channel is realized by using the Stream Control
   Transmission Protocol (SCTP) on top of the Datagram Transport Layer
   Security (DTLS) protocol [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-encaps].

   The realization of a bidirectional CLUE Data Channel is a pair of one
   incoming SCTP stream and one outgoing SCTP stream.  These streams are
   then used to transport CLUE messages in both directions.

   The SCTP streams MUST belong to the same SCTP association.

   The SCTP streams MUST have identical SCTP stream identifier values,
   unless a specific value is already used for some other purpose.

   OPEN ISSUE: The requirement to use identical STCP stream identifier
   values might be modified depending on what mechanism will be used to
   negotiate the identifier values.

3.3.  RTCWEB Data Channel Protocol Usage

   OPEN ISSUE: It is FFS whether the RTCWEB Data Channel Protocol will
   be used in the CLUE context.

3.4.  SCTP Considerations

3.4.1.  SCTP Payload Protocol Identifier (PPID)

   CLUE entities MUST use a PPID value of 51 or 54, according to the
   procedures in [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel].

   NOTE: As described in [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel], the PPID values
   are used to indicate that the SCTP message contains data encoded in a
   DOMstring format [reference-needed].

3.4.2.  Reliability

   CLUE entities MUST use the reliable transport SCTP feature.

   NOTE: [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel] requires the support of the
   partial reliability extension defined in [RFC3758].  This is not
   needed for CLUE, as messages are required to always be sent reliably.
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel] also mandates support of the limited
   retransmission policy defined in[ref-to-tuexen-tsvwg-sctp-
   prpolicies].

3.4.3.  Order

   CLUE entities MUST use the ordered delivery SCTP feature.

3.4.4.  Stream Reset

   CLUE entities MUST support the stream reset extension defined in
   [RFC6525]

   The dynamic address reconfiguration extension defined in [RFC5061]
   MUST be used to signal the support of the stream reset extension
   defined in [RFC6525].  Other features of [RFC5061] MUST NOT be used.

3.4.5.  Interleaving

   CLUE entities MUST support the message interleaving mechanism [ref-
   to-tuexen-tsvwg-sctp-prpolicies].

3.4.6.  SCTP Multihoming

   CLUE entities MUST NOT use SCTP multihoming.

   NOTE: The SCTPoDTLS mechanism does not support SCTP multihoming.
