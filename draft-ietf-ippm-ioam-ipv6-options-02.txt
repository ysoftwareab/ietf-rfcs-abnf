2.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.2.  Abbreviations

   Abbreviations used in this document:

   OAM:       Operations, Administration, and Maintenance

   IOAM:      In-situ OAM

   POT:       Proof of Transit

   E2E:       Edge-to-Edge

3.  In-situ OAM Metadata Transport in IPv6

   In-situ OAM in IPv6 is used to enhance diagnostics of IPv6 networks.
   It complements other mechanisms proposed to enhance diagnostics of
   IPv6 networks, such as the IPv6 Performance and Diagnostic Metrics
   Destination Option described in [RFC8250].

   IOAM data fields are encapsulated in "option data" fields of two
   types of extension headers in IPv6 packets - either Hop-by-Hop
   Options header or Destination options header.  The selection of a
   particular extension header type depends on IOAM usage, as described
   in section 4 of [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].  Multiple options with the
   same Option Type MAY appear in the same Hop-by-Hop Options or
   Destination Options header, with varying content.

   In order for IOAM to work in IPv6 networks, IOAM MUST be explicitly
   enabled per interface on every node within the IOAM domain.  Unless a
   particular interface is explicitly enabled (i.e. explicitly
   configured) for IOAM, a router MUST drop packets which contain
   extension headers carrying IOAM data-fields.  This is the default
   behavior and is independent of whether the Hop-by-Hop options or
   Destination options are used to encode the IOAM data.  This ensures
   that IOAM data does not unintentionally get forwarded outside the
   IOAM domain.

   An IPv6 packet carrying IOAM data in an Extension header can have
   other extension headers, compliant with [RFC8200].

   Option Type:  8-bit option type identifier as defined inSection 5.

   Opt Data Len:  8-bit unsigned integer.  Length of this option, in
      octets, not including the first 2 octets.

   Reserved:  8-bit field MUST be set to zero upon transmission and
      ignored upon reception.

   IOAM Type:  8-bit field as defined in section 7.2 in
      [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].

   Option Data:  Variable-length field.  Option-Type-specific data.

   In-situ OAM Options are inserted as Option data as follows:

   1.  Pre-allocated Trace Option: The in-situ OAM Preallocated Trace
       option defined in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data] is represented as an
       IPv6 option in Hop-by-Hop extension header:

       Option Type:  001xxxxx 8-bit identifier of the IOAM type of
          option. xxxxx=TBD.

       IOAM Type:  IOAM Pre-allocated Trace Option Type.

   2.  Incremental Trace Option: The in-situ OAM Incremental Trace
       option defined in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data] is represented as an
       IPv6 option in Hop-by-Hop extension header:

       Option Type:  001xxxxx 8-bit identifier of the IOAM type of
          option. xxxxx=TBD.

       IOAM Type:  IOAM Incremental Trace Option Type.

   3.  Proof of Transit Option: The in-situ OAM POT option defined in
       [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data] is represented as an IPv6 option in
       Hop-by-Hop extension header:

       Option Type:  001xxxxx 8-bit identifier of the IOAM type of
          option. xxxxx=TBD.

       IOAM Type:  IOAM POT Option Type.

   4.  Edge to Edge Option: The in-situ OAM E2E option defined in
       [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data] is represented as an IPv6 option in
       Destination extension header:

       Option Type:  000xxxxx 8-bit identifier of the IOAM type of
          option. xxxxx=TBD.

       IOAM Type:  IOAM E2E Option Type.

   All the in-situ OAM IPv6 options defined here have alignment
   requirements.  Specifically, they all require 4n alignment.  This
   ensures that fields specified in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data] are
   aligned at a multiple-of-4 offset from the start of the Hop-by-Hop
   and Destination Options header.  In addition, to maintain IPv6
   extension header 8-octet alignment and avoid the need to add or
   remove padding at every hop, the Trace-Type for Incremental Trace
   Option in IPv6 MUST be selected such that the IOAM node data length
   is a multiple of 8-octets.

   An outline of how the options defined here can be enabled and used in
   an IPv6 network is provided in
   [I-D.ioametal-ippm-6man-ioam-ipv6-deployment].

4.  Security Considerations

   This document describes the encapsulation of IOAM data fields in
   IPv6.  Security considerations of the specific IOAM data fields for
   each case (i.e., Trace, Proof of Transit, and E2E) are described and
   defined in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].

   As this document describes new options for IPv6, these are similar to
   the security considerations of [RFC8200] and the new weakness
   documented in [RFC8250].

5.  IANA Considerations

   This draft requests the following IPv6 Option Type assignments from
   the Destination Options and Hop-by-Hop Options sub-registry of
   Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Parameters.
