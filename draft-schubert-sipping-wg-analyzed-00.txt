Abstract

   This draft looks at drafts revision cycle, general submission trends
   from the past few years, average time-frame for draft to become an
   RFC, impact of presentations to RFC publcation etc.  Through this
   analysis, this draft hopes to aid in the discussion of how SIPPING WG
   may improve its efficiency on draft handling etc.

Internet-Draft  Analysis of SIPPING WG and its efficiency   October 2006


1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119[1].


2.  Introduction

   There has been quite a few discussions on SIPPING Mailing list
   regarding how the WG may improve the efficiency of draft handling,
   RFC publications etc.

   Although some suggestions were made and discussed there were no data
   nor statistics to support the justification of some of the ideas
   presented.

   This draft looks at various statistics and trends and raises some
   questions hoping to aid in the discussion.


3.  Method used

   Each WG items, RFCs and individual drafts intended for SIPPING WG
   were analyzed and categorized for their intentions.  Date of
   composition for each revisions on all the drafts and RFCs were
   recorded and were further filtered for the following purposes.

   1:   To observe the trends in number of draft submission.
   2:   To find the average time-frame for draft to become an RFC.
   3:   To find the average time-frame for draft to finish the
        publication process..
   4:   To find the average time-frame for draft to become a WG items.
   5:   To observe the correlation between the revision cycle and RFC
        publicaton .

   For each IETF meeting, agenda requests and actual agenda items were
   also analyzed to find the following facts.

   1:   To see the trends in agenda requests being denied.
   2:   To find the correlation between agenda presentation and its
        impact on RFC publication.
   3:   To find the average numbers of presentations given until draft
        becomes an RFC.

4.  General Facts

   Followings are some of the numbers describing the SIPPING WG.

   1:   First WG session was held in IETF 51 (5 years ago).
   2:   WG has accepted 74 drafts as a WG items.
   3:   WG has published 30 RFCs(6RFCs/year).
   4:   WG has 26 active drafts as of Oct. 2006.
   5:   Out of 74 drafts, 6 of the WG items are considered dead.
   6:   Out of 74 drafts, 5 of the WG items moved to other WG.
   7:   Out of 74 drafts, 8 of the WG items changed its name or merged
        to another draft.
   8:   WG has received 267 draft submissions since IETF 51.


5.  Average Time Frames

   RFCs from SIPPING WG were analyzed to find out the following average
   time-frame.

   1:   For individual draft to become a WG item : 8.9 months
   2:   For draft to reach the final revision : 16.4 months
   3:   Between the final revision to RFC pub. announcement : 8.3 months
   4:   Total for individual draft to become a RFC : 33 months
   5:   Average revision cycle : 3.6 months


6.  Publication Cycle

   RFCs from SIPPING WG were analyzed to see if the revision cycle has
   any impact on how fast the specification would progress.  And
   interesting enough, shorter the revision cycle shorter the total
   time-frame for a draft to become an RFC.

   1:   For WG item with average revision cycle of 3 months or less : 20
        months average from individual draft to RFC.
   2:   For WG item with average revision cycle of 3 months to 6 months
        : 38.6 months average from individual draft to RFC.
   3:   For WG item with average revision cycle of 6 months or more :
        47.5 months average from individual draft to RFC.
   4:   * P-header's average time-frame for becoming an RFC : 8 months


7.  Submission Trends

   This section looks at the number of draft submissions, number of
   newly accepted WG items and number of RFCs published in 5 years span.

   draft.

      7:   Number of total drafts submissions: 317


8.  Agenda Trends

   TBD


9.  Room for improvements?

   Although SIPPING was initially formed to filter work going into SIP
   WG for SIP WG to better address the drafts that are of interests of
   SIP WG, looking at the figures above it may be now SIP WG that needs
   to take back some of the task it delegated to SIPPING WG.  Here are
   some questions we may want to consider and its reasoning.

Internet-Draft  Analysis of SIPPING WG and its efficiency   October 2006


   1:   Is it necessary to analyze the requirements in SIPPING WG when
        the outcome is going to need a new SIP header or any other
        extensions that need to be further addressed in SIP WG?  (New
        response code etc.)
   2:   Is it necessary to analyze the requirements in SIPPING WG when
        the specification is addressing a security problems in SIP?
   3:   Can the WG prevent itself from accepting WG items that will die
        without becoming an RFC?


10.  Security Considerations

   There is no Security Consideration associated with this draft.


11.  IANA Considerations

   There is no IANA Considerations.
