1. Introduction 

   The basic Mobile IPv6 Protocol [RFC3775] is designed to deal with 
   node mobility from the perspective of network layer. But, for some 
   real time applications (i.e. Voice over IP and Video over IP), the 
   handover latency is too long to meet with their service continuity 
   requirements. 

   The Fast Mobile IPv6 Protocol [FMIP] has been developed and proposed 
   as a way to minimize the handover latency of Mobile IPv6 Protocol. In 
   [FMIP], some additional signals have been added to basic handover 
   procedure of Mobile IPv6 Protocol so as to shorten the handover time 
   and to smooth the service performance. There are two kinds of 
   handover modes in [FMIP], which are classified based on whether 
   mobile node has finished the IP layer related configuration before 
   attaching to the new link of access router. One kind of mode is 
   called "Predictive Mode" at which IP layer configuration is finished 
   before handover, and the other is called "Reactive mode".

Internet-Draft        AR-Info Problem Statement            August 2006 
    

   For both of the two handover modes, it is necessary for mobile node 
   to know the information of neighboring access routers abbreviated as 
   "AR-Info" in [FMIP]. The "AR-Info" is comprised of router's L2 
   address, router's IP address and router's IP prefix. Apart from "AR-
   Info", mobile node has to know the "AP-ID", the L2 link address of 
   the imminent access point, which can be gotten during scanning 
   processing. As for mobile node, the key knowledge is the (AP-ID, AR-
   Info) tuple which contains an access router's L2 address and IP 
   address, and the prefix valid on the interface to which the access 
   point (identified by AP-ID) is attached. 

   The [FMIP] has discussed carefully how to use the (AP-ID, AR-Info) 
   tuple to improve the handover performance. But [FMIP] says that the 
   method by which Access Routers exchange information about their   
   neighbors, and thereby allow construction of Proxy Router   
   Advertisements with information about neighboring subnets is outside   
   the scope of this document. 

   So, the aim of this document is to identify the common lines to the 
   possible solutions and to derive the set of functionalities required 
   to build (AP-ID, AR-Info) tuples for Proxy Router Advertisements. 

2. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [1]. 

   The following terminology and abbreviations are used in this document: 

   Information Centre Entity (ICE): 

      A new network element introduced in centralized (AP-ID, AR-Info) 
      construction scenario, which is in charge of gathering/delivering 
      (AP-ID, AR-Info) tuples from/to every access router. 

   Media Independent Handover (MIH): 

      MIH is a standard developed by IEEE 802.21 Working Group. This 
      standard is used to provide link layer intelligence and other 
      related network information to upper layers to optimize handovers 
      between heterogeneous media. 

   Base Transceiver Station (BTS):

Internet-Draft        AR-Info Problem Statement            August 2006 
    

      BTS is a L2 device terminating wireless access used in 3G access 
      networks. Its functionality is similar to Base Station in WIMAX 
      and Access Point in WLAN. 

   Access Service Network Gateway (ASN Gateway): 

      ASN Gateway serves as an access router to WIMAX wireless terminals. 

   Packet Data Supporting Node (PDSN): 

      PDSN serves as an access router to CDMA2000 wireless terminals, 
      which locates in CDMA2000 packet core network. 

3. Deployment Scenarios for constructing (AP-ID, AR-Info) tuples 

   Three different deployment scenarios are outlined in this section as 
   the following. These scenarios are intended to specify functionality 
   requirements for the candidate solutions, not to specify the 
   architecture of solutions.

Internet-Draft        AR-Info Problem Statement            August 2006 
    

   Figure1 depicts the reference model for heterogeneous network 
   application scenario working at the distributed construction mode of 
   (AP-ID, AR-Info) tuples. In this figure, three access routers with 
   different functionalities are presented. AR1 is an access router for 
   802.11 WLAN, to which two access points are attach. AR2 has two 
   802.16 base stations attaching to its different down link, which 
   plays a role of ASN Gateway. AR3 is an access router running in the 
   3G telecom networks, whose role may be PDSN in CDMA2000 network. AR3 
   has two Base Transceiver Stations attaching to its access link (in 
   this figure, Base Station Controller connecting BTS and AR is 
   omitted). 

   When Fast Mobile IPv6 Protocol is applied in this heterogeneous 
   network scenario, there are many factors implementing the 
   construction of (AP-ID, AR-Info) tuples, which should be considered 
   carefully. Detailed discussion is as the following. 

3.1.1. Construction of the AP-ID knowledge 

   When access router is integrated with wireless interfaces (such as 
   802.11 interfaces and 802.16 interfaces), it is very easy for access 
   router to get to know L2 address of wireless interfaces.  

   But, for AR1 and AR2 in figure1, the access points and base stations 
   work independently of access router. The access router can not get to 
   know the L2 address of AP/BS's wireless interface easily. In the 
   simpler case, manual configuration can be used to construct the L2 
   address knowledge of AP/BS for the access router. More sophisticated 
   solution is to run a dynamic discovering protocol by which access 
   router and AP/BS can interwork and deliver useful information to each 
   other. If there is an existing protocol having this kind of ability, 
   it can be used; otherwise new solution needs to be developed. For 
   different networks, the dynamic protocol is different; and the 
   designing of the dynamic protocol is outside the scope of MIPSHOP 
   working group. 

   AR3 is a network node in 3G networks. And BTS in 3G network works 
   differently with that in 802 series network. The great difference is 
   that BTS has no L2 address while AP/BS in 802 series network does 
   have (see [3GFH]). To identify an access network in CDMA2000, the 
   Access Network Identifier (ANID), which is composed of the System ID 
   (SID), Network ID (NID) and Packet Zone ID (PZID) can be used, 
   instead of using L2 address of AP/BS in 802 series wireless network. 
   Because there are many BTSes attaching to the same access router, it 
   is not easy for access router to get the knowledge about ANID. 
   Similarly, both manual configuration and automatic discovering 

 
 
<Xia>                 Expires February 18, 2007               [Page 5] 

Internet-Draft        AR-Info Problem Statement            August 2006 
    

   mechanism can be used to construct the ANID knowledge for the access 
   router. 

3.1.2. Construction of (AP-ID, AR-Info) tuples 

   Having gotten to know the information about AP-IDs, the access router 
   has to construct the associations used in Proxy Router Advertisement 
   between AP-IDs and AR-Info. 

   In nature, it's not difficult for access router to construct the 
   associations. No matter what construction mode of AP-IDs is used, AP-
   ID can be bound to a L3 interface which has its own information 
   absolutely. 

3.1.3. Discovery of neighboring network access routers 

   As for construction of (AP-ID, AR-Info) tuples, Figure1 is a 
   distributed reference model. Different access router has to construct 
   the repository of (AP-ID, AR-Info)s independently and serves for the 
   mobile nodes attaching to its link. Before access routers can 
   exchange neighboring network information, they have to know each 
   other.  

   It is very difficult for access router to determine the neighboring 
   network access routers. For different deployment applications, the 
   difference is great. Maybe the access routers at the same 
   geographical location are not neighboring network access routers even 
   though there is a direct link between them (i.e. neighboring routers). 
   And maybe the access routers far from each other are neighboring 
   network access routers even though there are many hops between them. 

   In the simpler case, manual configuration can help access router 
   determine neighboring network access routers. But for the large scale 
   telecom networks, the neighboring network relationship is very 
   complicated. And manual configuration can't be competent with this 
   situation. 

   More sophisticated solution is to use dynamic discovering protocol. 
   There are many factors deserved to be considered carefully, which are 
   outside the scope of this document. 

3.1.4. Selection of (AP-ID, AR-Info) tuples to be exchanged 

   In figure1, AR2 has four access sub-networks and AR3 has two. In the 
   real world, maybe there are more sub-networks attaching to the same 
   access router. So it's not necessary for neighboring network access 
   routers to exchange all of the (AP-ID, AR-Info) tuples. More

Internet-Draft        AR-Info Problem Statement            August 2006 
    

   effective way is only to exchange overlay/neighboring sub-network 
   information. How to determine overlay/neighboring sub-networks is 
   outside the scope of this document. 

3.1.5. Transportation of messages  

   Transportation is performed between neighboring network access 
   routers. Different kinds of messages require kinds of service level 
   agreement for transportation. For example, management and control 
   messages should be transported at reliability channel while (AP-ID, 
   AR-Info) bearing messages require a fast and no guaranteed 
   reliability one. Besides, many general transportation functionality 
   should be consider carefully, such as congestion avoidance, 
   reliability, security, fragmentation as well as reordering etc.  

3.2. Centralized application scenario for construction

   Figure2: Reference model for centralized construction scenario 

   Figure2 depicts a reference model for centralized construction 
   scenario of (AP-ID, AR-Info). In contrast with Figure1, there is no 
   great difference except that a new node called Information Centre 
   Entity (ICE) is added. 

   The Information Centre is a central repository of (AP-ID, AR-Info) 
   tuples, which aggregates (AP-ID, AR-Info) tuples from every access 
   router and delivers them to the requesting access router. 

   For the centralized construction scenario, there are no new 
   requirements about construction of AP-ID knowledge and (AP-ID, AR-
   Info) tuples compared with the distributed construction scenario.  

   Introduction of Information Centre makes it unnecessary to run a 
   dynamic discovering protocol of neighboring network access router 
   because access router works together with ICE, instead of with 
   neighboring network access routers. 

   It is very important and useful to determine the (AP-ID, AR-Info) 
   tuples to be exchanged between access router and ICE. Having 
   constructed the (AP-ID, AR-Info) tuples, access router has to select 
   the suitable tuples to be delivered to ICE. Access router can request 
   (AP-ID, AR-Info) tuples from ICE based on AP-IDs; and ICE maybe push 
   the suitable (AP-ID, AR-Info) tuples to a specific access router base 
   on some polices. 

   The transportation requirements for centralized construction scenario 
   are the same as for distributed construction scenario. 

3.3. Mixed application scenario for construction

     Figure3: Reference model for mixed construction scenario  

   Figure3 depicts a reference model for mixed (distributed and 
   centralized) construction scenario. From functional component 
   perspective, Figure3 is the same as Figure2. In Figure3, only AR2 has 
   established association with ICE while both AR1 and AR2 interwork 
   with AR2. 

   For the mixed construction scenario in Figure3, AR1 and AR3 get 
   neighboring network information from AR2. And AR2 exchanges 
   information with AR1, AR2 and ICE at the same time. In this scenario, 
   AR2 maybe acts as a proxy for AR1 and AR3 to exchange information 
   with ICE. 

   There are no special requirements for the mixed construction scenario 
   compared with the above mentioned two scenarios. 

3.4. Others 

   The above mentions scenarios may be applied to the same domain owned 
   by the same operator. How to construct (AP-ID, AR-Info) tuples for 
   access routers owned by different operators needs to be studied 
   further.

4. Interaction with MIH service 

   Media Independent Services, including Event Service, Command Service 
   and Information Service are designed by IEEE802.21 Working Group, 
   which help MIH service user (i.e. mobility management protocol) 
   facilitate the recognition that a handover should take place, 
   discover information on how to make effective handover decisions and 
   expedite handover executing procedure.  

   The Event Service, Command Service and Information Service are 
   defined in [MIH]. And [MIHPS] has proposed the brief definition for 
   these services. 

   In general, MIH services have established an architecture that 
   enables transparent service continuity while mobile node moves 
   between heterogeneous networks; determined a set of handover-enabling 
   functions within the mobility-management protocol stacks of the 
   network elements; and defined additional MAC layer SAPs and 
   associated primitives for each specific access technology. 

   The Information Service of [MIH] can be used to transport and 
   construct (AP-ID, AR-Info) tuples of neighboring access network. [MIH] 
   has defined three kinds of information elements for Information 
   Service. One kind is Link Layer Information Element, which can be 
   used to transport (AP-ID, AR-Info) tuples between two access routers 
   as well as between access router and Information Centre Entity.  

4.1. Using MIH IS in distributed construction scenario 

   Figure4 depicts the transportation and construction procedure for 
   (AP-ID, AR-Info) tuples of neighboring network using Information 
   Service. After two neighboring network access routers discover each 
   other, one access router can query the other for specific (AP-ID, AR-
   Info) tuples; and the other can send the response to the querying 
   access router. Besides the query and response messages, MIH 
   Information service should support the other type of messages, such 
   as "report message" which can be used to transport a bulk of (AP-ID, 
   AR-Info) tuples without active query when access routers discover 
   each other firstly.

4.2. Using MIH IS in centralized scenario 

   Figure5 depicts the transportation and construction procedure of (AP-
   ID, AR-Info) tuples in centralized construction scenario. In this 
   figure, after AR1 and AR2 have discovered the ICE supporting MIH 
   Information Service, both access routers send the report of own (AP-
   ID, AR-Info) tuples to ICE. And then, both of them query the (AP-ID, 
   AR-Info) tuples of neighboring networks from ICE. For this scenario, 
   ICE is an central repository of (AP-ID, AR-Info) tuples.

4.3. (AP-ID, AR-Info)s transportation consideration 

   Before transporting Information Service bearing (AP-ID, AR-Info)s, 
   every transportation peer, including access router and ICE, should 
   discover each other at first. For the distributed construction 
   scenario, access router has to discover the peers firstly which 
   provide Information Service; and for the centralized construction 
   scenario, access router has to know the ICE firstly which provide the 
   Information Service. If MIH services cover the peer discovering 
   function, more attention should be paid to this; otherwise, it is 
   necessary to develop a new protocol or to select an existing one so 
   as to cover this function. 

   Even though MIH services provide transportation service, it does not 
   know what to be transported, which depends on the MIH services user 
   (i.e. MIP6 or FMIP). Particularly, it is not easy for access router 
   to determine what tuples should be transported and which access 
   router is the destination in the distributed construction scenario. 

    

5. Security Considerations 

   Construction of (AP-ID, AR-Info) tuples is performed by network 
   infrastructure, especially by access router and ICE, not involving 
   untrusting outer entity. So it is relatively secure.  

   In some cases, neighboring network access routers are owned by the 
   different operators or connected through public network (such as 
   Internet). So, it is necessary for access router to authenticate each 
   other; and the authentication procedure should be protected by a 
   secure channel. At the same time, the messages exchanged among access 
   routers and ICE should be encrypted. 

6. IANA Considerations 

   IANA considerations are not applicable for this document.

7. Conclusions 

   This document has outlined three scenarios for constructions of (AP-
   ID, AR-Info) tuples and raised some issues needed to be considered 
   carefully. This document thinks MIH service can help access router 
   construct and transport (AP-ID, AR-Info) tuples. But some other 
   factors, such as discovering mechanism and content selection method 
   should be considered.
