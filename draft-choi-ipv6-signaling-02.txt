1. Introduction 
   
  Many signaling mechanisms are defined and developed to support 
  Quality of Service (QoS) in IP networks. Those are chosen by users to 
  satisfy their needs, objectives, and implementation costs. Also most 
  of the signaling protocols are based on the underlying network 
  infrastructure, i.e. IP networks, but they don't depend on the minor 
  version of the network. For example, one signaling protocol designed 
  for the IPv4 network can be used in IPv6 network without modifying 
  the specification of the signaling mechanism. Rather than to do like 
  that, the signaling protocol adopt itself to the different version of 
  network implementation by defining option fields like IP version 
  information field and related information like IPv4 addresses (32 
  bits) or IPv6 addresses (128 bits). 
   
  Actually, IPv6 has many features to support QoS and other 
  capabilities for the emerged networks. We will describe about that in 
  section 2. Also, those features can be used to help existing IPv4 
  based signaling mechanisms or used to substitute some functions of 
  existing signaling protocols in order to make the signaling protocols 
  more fully using the power of IPv6 features. 
   
  In this draft, we describe the features and requirements of IPv6 
  signaling protocol to explain the needs of QoS signaling in IPv6 
  network. Deployment point of view, we also explain three stages of 
  evolution scenarios and mapping of IPv6 signaling with IPv4 in some 
  detail. Finally, the delivering methods of signaling messages in IPv6 
  network are presented in appendix.

2. The Needs of QoS Signaling in IPv6 networks 
   
2.1. IP related Signaling Protocols 
   
  There are already many signaling protocols in IP networks to provide 
  some control delivering mechanism with or without QoS support. We can 
  classify the signaling mechanisms regarding the actual nodes that are 
  affected by that signaling protocol. 
   
  A signaling protocol may concern with a pair of node that may be host 
  or router. Like ICMP, that kind of signaling protocol is just for the 
  information notification. On the other hand, like SIP described in 
  [RFC 2543], some signaling may be transferring the QoS related 
  information that can be used to a node to determine the control of 
  resource of the node.  
   
  There are other kinds of signaling protocols that effect on the nodes 
  on a path of source to destination path. With regarding the QoS, 
  currently RSVP [RFC 2205](or RSVP-TE [RFC 3209]) and LDP[RFC 3036] 
  (or CR-LDP [RFC 3212]) is defined to provide QoS in intermediate node 
  of the path in the IP networks. We just use the term "IP network" 
  because any kind of sub layer mechanism can be used to support the 
  transport of IP packets.  
   
  Other signaling protocols are defined between the neighbors those are 
  connected with link. We will not mention about this case because this 
  case is treated with special case of above two cases. 
  We will regard the signaling protocols that use IP or higher layer 
  and related with QoS mechanisms. 
   
2.2. QoS related Signaling Protocols 
 
  Usually the QoS mechanisms are supported in the IP layer or the 
  Transport layer (for example, TCP or UDP). To simplify the discussion, 
  we will just regard the three signaling protocols, RSVP-TE, CR-LDP, 
  SIP. These signaling protocols are covering the classification in 
  section 2.1 and also these signaling mechanisms can be used for the 
  some or all of QoS supporting features described in 2.3. Also we note 
  that these are running on the IP and TCP (UDP) layer. We will explain 
  these signaling protocols as briefly as possible to make our 
  discussion further. 
   
  o  RSVP-TE (including RSVP-TE extension for GMPLS [RSVP-TE 07]) 
   
  RSVP-TE, originated by RSVP is used for the IntServ model described 
  in [RFC 2210]. Both RSVP and RSVP-TE are implemented on the IP layer. 
  RSVP is defined to support QoS in IP network with fine granularity, 
  but this leads the scalability problems. RSVP-TE has some additional 
  concepts, like label distribution, aggregated flow, and explicit 
  route. But RSVP-TE doesn't support multicasting environment.

                  The Features of IPv6 Signaling              June 2002 
 
 
   
  o  CR-LDP (including CR-LDP extension for GMPLS [CR-LDP 06]) 
   
  CR-LDP, from LDP, is used for the almost same purpose of RSVP-TE. But 
  this signaling protocol use the TCP (and UDP) layer instead of IP 
  layer in RSVP-TE. So this signaling protocol uses the features of TCP 
  protocol.  
   
  o  SIP and H.323 
   
  To provide the multimedia services, like voice or moving pictures, 
  SIP and other protocols are defined to provide the server and client 
  side QoS mechanism. This protocol use ether TCP or UDP. 
   
2.3. The Features of QoS related Signaling in IPv6 Networks 
   
  We will choose some existing signaling protocols to explain our idea. 
  To validate the further discussion, we must describe the features of 
  signaling mechanisms in IPv6 network with supporting QoS. 
   
  o  QoS support 
   
  Information with QoS controlling is important context of signaling 
  packet. With aggregated flow concept, IPv6 signaling mechanisms can 
  provide finer QoS granularity than DiffServ model, and more scalable 
  than IntServ model.  
   
  o  Resource Reservation 
   
  The key role of signaling protocol is to allocate and reserve the 
  network resource for the purpose of meeting end-to-end QoS 
  requirements along the entire path. The signaling protocol MUST be 
  able to deal with such resource allocation requests. 
   
  o  Priority Flow Control 
   
  Each node has many flows with different priority of various data 
  rates and QoS requirements. These flows are classified and scheduled 
  with the capability of making intelligent decisions on how resource 
  allocation SHOULD be controlled.  
   
  o  Explicit route 
   
  In IPv6 specification, there is a route extension header to use 
  explicit route. Explicit route is important for traffic engineering 
  in IPv6 networks, so we can use of this option header. In doing so, 
  signaling packet specify the route with route extension header and 
  data packet is just switched according to flow label in each router 
  on the path specified with signaling packet. There is already ROUTE 
  object in RSVP-TE specification [RFC 3209]. In the case of CR-LDP, 
  some TLVs are defined to be used for this purpose.

                  The Features of IPv6 Signaling              June 2002 
 
 
   
  o  Scalability 
   
  The performance of the signaling protocol SHOULD not largely depend 
  on the scale of the network to which IPv6 is applied (e.g. the number 
  of nodes, the number of physical links etc). The signaling function 
  SHOULD keep constant performance as much as possible regardless of 
  network size. Aggregating flows can reduce resource allocation and 
  runtime management overhead. 
   
  o  Flow Label Information Distribution 
   
  To make use of flow label field [Flow Label 02] of IPv6 basic header 
  and identify the flow label between the routers on specific path, 
  label-binding information SHOULD be delivered between the related 
  routers. The related routers are on the path of the flow. Label value 
  is only meaningful between a pair of routers. And the label value is 
  predetermined before forwarding data packet along the path. 
   
  o  Label Stacking 
   
  In Label Switching, label stacking concept is addressed. To enable 
  the label stacking, the signaling protocol is defined to notify the 
  stacking information. But we don't consider the concept in this 
  version. 
   
2.4. The Requirements of QoS Signaling Protocol in IPv6 Networks 
   
  Besides of features of signaling, we SHOUD consider the following 
  requirements of QoS signaling in IPv6 networks. 
   
  o  Make use of IPv6 features  
    
  IPv6 have many features to make use of that to provide some new 
  functions. For example, one can want to use the IPv6 Routing Option 
  header to send signaling packet along the desired path rather than 
  the shortest path. This is reasonable because the IPv6 routers may be 
  implement routing option header processing component so we can use 
  that without any additional functional implementations. Also we can 
  think about the hop-by-hop header to notify routers that the packets 
  have some signaling and reservation information. These things are 
  already considered in other signaling mechanism. That means we can 
  use the IPv6 native features or don't use of them. There is another 
  viewpoint related with this. If the same information is transferred 
  with IPv6 header and payload, there may exist the consistency 
  problems. So some people want to make one of choices, not both of 
  them.

                  The Features of IPv6 Signaling              June 2002 
 
 
   
  o  Backward compatibility 
   
  The existing signaling protocols such as RSVP, RSVP-TE, CR-LDP and so 
  on are implemented in IPv4 network. These signaling protocols MUST be 
  operated in IPv6 network. Therefore, they MUST support backward 
  compatibility for operating both IPv6 and IPv4.  
   
   
  o  Easy to implement  
      
  There are two aspects related with this issue. First, we can consider   
  the compatibility of the new signaling with existing signaling. So   
  the implementation can be done with minimum modification of previous   
  architecture and components. Second we can omit some functions of   
  previous signaling so that we just make a light-weight signaling   
  mechanism. We are still studying about this carefully because it   
  makes some effects with other various factors such like the   
  capabilities of this new signaling and the signaling translation   
  between two heterogeneous AS's. We can think above two factors 
  simultaneously and SHOULD make some trade-off.  
   
  o  Signaling interworking between IPv6 and IPv4  
    
  To be gradually deployed, we can consider the situation of mixed    
  nodes that some implement the IPv6 signaling and others implement    
  the IPv4 signaling. In this environment, we consider signaling 
  interworking issues. So we will explain mapping of IPv6 signaling 
  with IPv4 in section 3.  
    
  o  Traffic parameters for QoS negotiation 
   
  There are many traffic parameters such as peak data rate, peak burst 
  size, committed data rate, committed burst size, excess burst size 
  and so on. The QoS signaling applies the traffic parameters per 
  aggregated flow. To make use of this, state of QoS information SHOLD 
  be maintained per aggregated flow. Also the adding and deleting of a 
  flow with respect to the aggregated flow SHOULD be carefully managed. 
  An aggregated flow is not just used for label-related switching, but 
  also used for classification information in routers on path. So the 
  traffic parameter information SHOULD be stored in the router with the 
  information related with an aggregated flow identifier(s).  
   
  o  Mobility support  
   
  To provide the QoS in mobile environment, we SHOLD consider the   
  mobility of nodes and dynamic behavior of related flows. In signaling,   
  we are concerning two problems. First the flow management can be   
  considered with per aggregated flow or per flow. In some point, 
  snapshot of network can be described with many aggregated flows and 
  related QoS management. But as time goes, some flow of mobile node

  departs one aggregated flow and join the other aggregated flow. 
  Second the support of micro mobility issues. To make use of old flow 
  related resources as much as possible, we should define Nearest 
  Common Router (NCR) and provide the finding mechanism. This work is 
  under working. We just consider the need of modification or 
  adaptation of that mechanism in our work.  
   
  o  Inter-operation with other QoS-supporting networks  
   
  In this version, we cannot consider this issue.  
   
   
3. Mapping of IPv6 Signaling with IPv4 
   
  The current Internet will smoothly transit from IPv4 to IPv6. 
  Deployment point of view, we consider three stages of evolution 
  scenarios  
   
  - first stage (stage 1): IPv4 ocean and IPv6 island 
  - second stage (stage 2): IPv6 ocean and IPv4 island 
  - third stage (stage 3): IPv6 ocean and IPv6 island 
   
  In first stage shown in Figure 1, MPLS-based core network (e.g., IPv4 
  ocean) and IPv6 access network (e.g., IPv6 island)is deployed. In 
  this environment, core signaling such as RSVP-TE and CR-LDP is used 
  in IPv4 ocean and access signaling such as RSVP and RSVP-TE is used 
  in IPv6 island. To support end-to-end QoS signaling, these protocols 
  SHOUD perform the mapping of IPv6 signaling with IPv4. Flow label 
  information of IPv6 header is translated to FEC(Forwarding Equivalent 
  Class) information of MPLS. For this reason, signaling interworking 
  function is needed. Using this QoS signaling, flow information is 
  transmitted unchanged from source to destination and the required 
  resource is reserved and end to end path is established.

  In second stage shown in Figure 2, IPv6 network will dominate over 
  IP4 network. This network is composed of IPv6-based core network 
  (e.g., IPv6 ocean) and IPv4-based access network (e.g., IPv4 island). 
  The existing IPv4 network is operated in MPLS. In this environment, 
  core signaling such as RSVP-TE and CR-LDP is used in IPv6 ocean and 
  access signaling such as RSVP and RSVP-TE is used in IPv4 island. FEC 
  information of IPv4 is translated to flow label information of IPv6.

                 Figure 2. Signaling mapping (stage 2) 
   
   
  In third stage shown in Figure 3, IPv6 protocol is implemented both 
  core network (e.g., IPv6 ocean) and access network (e.g., IPv6 
  island). Signaling protocol like RSVP-TE MAY be used without 
  signaling translation.

4. Other Issues 
   
  The problems arise from the tunneling such like mobile IPv6 
  mechanisms are not fully exploited in this version of document. Also 
  the more detail procedure of signaling packet processing in CR-LDP 
  and RSVP-TE in case of the explicit route information is carried in 
  Routing Option header should be considered. We are studying about 
  these issues.  
   
5. IANA Considerations 
   
  The value field described in appendix SHOULD be registered and 
  maintained by IANA. The New values SHOULD be to be assigned via IETF 
  Consensus as defined in [RFC 2434]. 
   
6. Security Considerations 
   
  This document does not have any security concerns. The security 
  requirements using this document are described in the referenced 
  documents.

Appendix. The delivering methods of signaling messages in IPv6 network 
   
  In this appendix, we will describe the delivering methods of existing 
  signaling protocols in IPv6 networks via using IPv6 extension headers. 
  The use of these methods in existing signaling protocols is discussed 
  in the last of this section. 
   
1. RSVP/RSVP-TE for IPv6 (including RSVP-TE extension for GMPLS) 
   
  o Using Router Alert Option 
   
  Router alert option [RFC 2711] within the IPv6 Hop-by-Hop option 
  header has the semantic "routers should examine the datagram more 
  closely". Using this option, IPv6 datagram containing signaling 
  messages are indicated and taken actions. 
   
  The router alert option has the following format: 
   
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
  |0 0 0|0 0 1 0 1|0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0|        Value (2 octets)       | 
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
                     length = 2 
   
  The first three bits of the first byte are zero and the value 5 in 
  the remaining five bits is the Hop-by-Hop Option Type number. 
  [RFC 2460] specifies the meaning of the first three bits.  By   
  zeroing all three, this specification requires that nodes not   
  recognizing this option type should skip over this option and 
  continues processing the header and that the option must not change 
  en route. 
   
  There MUST only be one option of this type, regardless of value, 
  per Hop-by-Hop header. 
   
      Value:  A 2 octets code in network byte order with the following 
      values 
   
        0        Datagram contains a Multicast Listener Discovery 
                 message [RFC 2710]. 
        1        Datagram contains RSVP message. 
        2        Datagram contains an Active Networks message. 
        3-65535  Reserved to IANA for future use. 
   
  Alignment requirement: 2n+0

  signaling messages MAY be added. In this case, the value for new 
  signaling message SHOULD be assigned by IANA. 
   
  The described method has some advantages and disadvantages. It is not 
  necessary to implement the new protocol for signaling. The existing 
  signaling message is used without change. However, all IPv6 datagram 
  containing a signaling message MUST contain this option within the 
  IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Option Header of such datagram. The additional option 
  header is redundant. 
   
   
  o Next Header for signaling 
   
  This method uses the new Next Header value for signaling message. 
  Message body includes signaling messages like RSVP/RSVP-TE. Every 
  signaling message is preceded by an IPv6 header or by more IPv6 
  extension headers. The signaling message is identified by a Next 
  Header value in the immediately preceding header. 
   
  The signaling messages have the following general format:

      Flow Label           20-bit flow label.  
       
      Payload Length       16-bit unsigned integer.  Length of the IPv6         
                           payload, i.e., the rest of the packet 
                           following this IPv6 header, in octets 
       
      Next Header          8-bit selector.  Identifies the type of 
                           signaling message immediately following the 
                           IPv6 header. Uses the same values as the 
                           IPv4 Protocol field [RFC 1700 et seq.]. 
       
      Hop Limit            8-bit unsigned integer.  Decremented by 1 by 
                           each node that forwards the packet. The 
                           packet is discarded if Hop Limit is 
                           decremented to zero. 
       
      Source Address       128-bit address of the originator of the 
                           packet. 
       
      Destination Address  128-bit address of the intended recipient of 
                           the packet (possibly not the ultimate 
                           recipient, if a Routing header is present).   
   
   
  For this method, we MUST assign the new Next Header value of IPv6 
  header. Currently, RSVP is already assigned the value 46 decimal in 
  [RFC 1700].  
   
  For example, if the Next Header value of IPv6 header is 46 decimal 
  the following ISMP message is RSVP message. The Next Header value of 
  other unassigned signaling messages SHOULD be assigned by IANA.  
   
  This second method may be used for the signaling protocols which are 
  running on the IP layer.  
   
  Compared with the method using router alert option, this method is 
  very simple because of no additional extension header. Therefore, the 
  complexity of processing is reduced but this new function MUST be 
  implemented within IPv6 header.  
   
     Note) The signaling protocols, like SIP, that are used for end-to-
     end path may use the option TLVs to indicate the presence of the 
     signaling information. We already know that the real-time service 
     cannot be served without support of intermediate node. If some 
     end-to-end sessions are need to be guaranteed to their perceived 
     QoS, the intermediate nodes those are on the path may use the 
     information to do something related with QoS implicitly.

2. CR-LDP for IPv6 (including CR-LDP extension for GMPLS) 
   
  In the case of RSVP-TE, if the header of a packet is indicating "This 
  packet carries the signaling information." then the intermediate 
  routers and the end host can make different treatment on just only 
  look at the IP header. 
   
  On the other hand, like CR-LDP, the protocol running on the TCP(UDP) 
  layer may also make use of the benefit that IP header already notify 
  the existence of signaling information in the payload of IP packet. 
  Originally in the CR-LDP protocol, the signaling information is 
  transferred along the path per hop. If a router sees the notification 
  of signaling information in the IP header, it can forward the 
  signaling packet and processing the signaling information 
  simultaneously. So the forwarding direction of packet can be done 
  faster than old mechanisms.
