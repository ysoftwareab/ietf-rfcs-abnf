1.  Introduction

   The LISP architecture and protocols [RFC6830] introduces two new
   numbering spaces, Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs) and Routing Locators
   (RLOCs) which are intended to replace most use of IP addresses on the
   Internet.  To provide flexibility for current and future
   applications, these values can be encoded in LISP control messages
   using a general syntax that includes Address Family Identifier (AFI)
   [RFC1700].

   This specification introduces the use of Geo-Coordinates that can be
   used in EID-records and RLOC-records of LISP control messages.  The
   encoding format is specified in [LCAF] as the "Geo-Coordinates LCAF
   Type".

2.  Definition of Terms

   Geo-Point  is a Geo-Coordinate according to [GEO] that defines a
      point from parameters Latitude, Longitude, and Altitude.

   Geo-Prefix  forms a circle of a geographic area made up of a Geo-
      Point and a Radius.  A Geo-Point is known to be "more-specific"
      than a Geo-Prefix when its physical location is within the
      geographic circle.

3.  Geo-Points in RLOC-records

   Geo-Points can accompany an RLOC-record to determine the physical
   location of an ETR or RTR.  This can aid in determining geographical
   distance when topological distance is inaccurate or hidden.  When
   Geo-Points are encoded in RLOC-records with RLOC addresses the LCAF
   AFI-List Type should be used.

   Geo-Points can be used as the sole piece of information in an RLOC-
   record when an EID maps to a Geo-Coordinate.  If it is desirable to
   find the geographical location of any EID, this method can be
   convienent.

   Here is a high-level use-case where an EID that maps to a Geo-
   Coordinate can be used.  Lets say that am EID is assigned to a
   physical shipping package by a package delivery company.  And the EID
   is encoded as an IPv6 address where the tracking number is embedded
   in an IPv6 EID.  The network has LISP nodes deployed in many
   locations that are configured with their respective Geo-Coordinates.
   As the package roams, the LISP node that discovers the EID, registers
   it to the LISP mapping system.  The EID-to-RLOC mapping is EID=IPv6
   and RLOC=Geo-Coordinate.  If someone does a mapping database lookup
   on the IPv6 EID, what is returned is the Geo-Coordinate.  As the EID
   roams, new registrations with different Geo-Coordinates are stored,
   allowing the physical tracking of the package.

4.  Geo-Prefixes in EID-records and RLOC-records

   A Geo-Prefix is defined to be a Geo-Coordinate point and a Radius.
   This allows a circle to be drawn on a geographic map.  The Geo-Prefix
   can describe a coarse physical location for an RLOC when encoded in
   an RLOC-record.  So an RLOC could be registered in the mapping
   database indicating it is in a city or country versus the exact
   location where a Geo-Point would locate it.

   A Geo-Prefix could allow a Distinguished-Name [DIST-NAME] to be
   registered as an EID with an RLOC that contains a Geo-Prefix.  For
   example EID="San Francisco", with RLOC=geo-prefix could be stored in
   the mapping system.

   A Geo-Prefix, when encoded in an EID-record, could be registered as
   an EID-prefix and when a Geo-Point is used as an EID lookup key, a
   sort of longest match could be looked up.  If the Geo-Point is in the
   Circle described by the Geo-Prefix, an entry is returned to the Map-
   Requestor.

   You could take a combination of mappings from the above examples to
   ask the question: "Is the package in San Francisco"?  This could be
   done with two lookups to the mapping system:

   Contents of Mapping Database:
     EID=<dist-name="san francisco">
     RLOC=<geo-prefix-of-60-mile-radius-of-sf>

     EID=<ipv6-package-tracking-number>
     RLOC=<geo-point-of-current-location>

     EID=<geo-prefix-of-60-mile-radius-of-sf>
     RLOC=<dist-name="san francisco">

   Map-Request for package:
     EID=<ipv6-package-tracking-number>
   Mapping system returns:
     RLOC=<geo-point-of-current-location>

   Map-Request for geo-point:
     EID=<geo-point-of-current-location>
   Mapping system longest-match lookup returns:
     EID=<geo-prefix-of-60-mile-radius-of-sf>
     RLOC=<dist-name="san francisco">

   If the package was not in San Francisco, the second mapping table
   lookup would fail.

   Another application is concentric rings of WiFi access-points.  The
   radius of each ring corresponds to the Wifi signal strength.  An EID
   could be located in any on the inner rings but possibly on the edge
   of a ring.  A WiFi access-point RLOC can be selected to encapsulate
   packets to because it will have better signal to the current EID
   location.  And when there are intersecting circles, it can be
   determined that when the EID is in the intersection of the circles,
   it would be a good time to transition radios to closer APs or base
   stations.

   When assigning EIDs to vehicles [V2I], a Geo-Prefix could be used to
   create a "reachability set" of Road-Side-Units (RSUs).  So an ITR
   could encapsulate to multiple RLOCs in the Geo-Prefix to try to
   create connectivity to the vehicle while roaming.  This makes use of
   predictive RLOCs that can be used when the direction of the roaming
   EID is known (a train track or single direction road, but not a
   flight path of a plane).

   This draft proposes to change the "Rsvd2" field from [LCAF] to
   "Radius-high" and take 8 bits from "Altitude" for Radius-low to make
   up a 16-bit value.  When "Radius" is 0 the Geo-Coordinate encoding is
   a Geo-Point.  When non-zero, it is the radius of the circle in
   kilometers.  The maximum value is 65535 kilometers which is almost
   twice the distance of the earth's circumference.

6.  Security Considerations

   The use of Geo-Coordinates in any application must be considered
   carefully to not violate and privacy concerns about physical
   location.

7.  IANA Considerations

   At this time there are no specific requests for IANA.
