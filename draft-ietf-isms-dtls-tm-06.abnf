tmTransportDomain  = snmpTLSTCPDomain, snmpDTLSUDPDomain or
          snmpDTLSSCTPDomain as appropriate.

tmTransportAddress  = The address the message originated from.

tmSecurityLevel  = The derived tmSecurityLevel for the session,
          as discussed in Section 3.1.2 and Section 5.3.

tmSecurityName  = The derived tmSecurityName for the session as
          discussed in Section 5.3.  This value MUST be constant during
          the lifetime of the (D)TLS session.

tmSessionID  = The tlstmSessionID, which MUST be a unique session
          identifier for this (D)TLS connection.  The contents and
          format of this identifier are implementation-dependent as long
          as it is unique to the session.  A session identifier MUST NOT
          be reused until all references to it are no longer in use.
          The tmSessionID is equal to the tlstmSessionID discussed in
          Section 5.1.1. tmSessionID refers to the session identifier
          when stored in the tmStateReference and tlstmSessionID refers
          to the session identifier when stored in the LCD.  They MUST
          always be equal when processing a given session's traffic.
