1.  Introduction

   The OpenPGP specification [RFC4880] allows primary keys to associate
   themselves with identities in the form of User ID and User Attribute
   packets.  The only defined type of User Attribute is JPEG.  This
   document introduces the URI subpacket as an additional type of User
   Attribute subpacket.

1.1.  Scope

   Similar to RFC 4880, the scope of this document is limited to a
   technical description of the format, and does not include specifics
   on how URI Attributes may be used by implementations.

1.2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].  Any
   implementation that adheres to the format and methods specified in
   this document is called a compliant application.  Compliant
   applications are a subset of the broader set of OpenPGP applications
   described in [RFC4880].  Any [RFC2119] keyword within this document
   applies to compliant applications only.

2.  URI User Attribute subpacket

   The URI subpacket is added as an additional User Attribute subpacket
   with type id [TBD] to expand Section 5.12 of the OpenPGP
   specification [RFC4880], "User Attribute Packet (Tag 17)".  The body
   of this subpacket consists of a single UTF-8 encoded URI string.  A
   URI Attribute is a User Attribute packet with a single URI subpacket.

   The purpose of this packet type is to provide a mechanism for
   associating the key with an identity encoded in a URI.  The

Internet-Draft         URI Attributes for OpenPGP               May 2015


   particular semantics of a URI depend on its scheme, there are no
   restrictions on the URIs which may appear in URI Attributes.

   An implementation SHOULD NOT issue certificates for URI Attributes
   with unknown URI schemes.  It MAY treat such packets as opaque, or
   display their contents in a generic way.

3.  Compatibility

   An implementation SHOULD NOT use a URI Attribute to fulfill the
   minimum requirement of one User ID packet in a transferable key.
   This is to ensure that at least one non-opaque type of user id is
   part of every key.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a number to the URI User Attribute
   subpacket, updating the User Attribute Type namespace established in
   [RFC4880].  See Section 2.

           +------+---------------------+-----------+
           | ID   | User Attribute Type | Reference |
           +------+---------------------+-----------+
           | TBD1 | URI                 | This doc  |
           +------+---------------------+-----------+

   [Notes to RFC-Editor: Please remove the table above on publication.
   There are no non-standardized types used in current implementations
   known to the author.  As of now 2 is the next free number.]

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of the URI Attribute are the same as for
   other identity packets, leaving the considerations from [RFC4880]
   unchanged.
