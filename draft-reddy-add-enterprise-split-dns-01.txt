         Split-Horizon DNS Configuration in Enterprise Networks
                draft-reddy-add-enterprise-split-dns-01

Abstract

   When split-horizon DNS is deployed by an enterprise, certain
   enterprise domains are only resolvable by querying the network-
   provided DNS server.  DNS clients which use DNS servers not provided
   by the network need to route those DNS domain queries to the network-
   provided DNS server.  This document informs DNS clients of split-
   horizon DNS, their DNS domains, and is compatible with encrypted DNS.

1.  Introduction

   Historically, an endpoint would utilize network-provided DNS servers
   upon joining a network (e.g., DHCP OFFER, IPv6 Router Advertisement).
   While it has long been possible to configure endpoints to ignore the
   network's suggestions and use a (public) DNS server on the Internet,
   this was seldom used because some networks block UDP/53 (in order to
   enforce their own DNS policies).  With the advent of DoT and DoH,
   such network blocking is more difficult, but the endpoint is unable
   to (properly) resolve split-horizon DNS domains which must query the
   network-provided DNS server.

   [RFC7626] discusses DNS privacy considerations in both "on the wire"
   (Section 2.4 of [RFC7626]) and "in the server" (Section 2.5 of
   [RFC7626]) contexts.  Also, there has been an increase in the
   availability of "public resolvers" [RFC8499] which DNS clients may be
   pre-configured to use instead of the default network resolver for a
   variety of reasons (e.g., offer a good reachability, support an
   encrypted transport, provide a claimed privacy policy, (lack of)
   filtering).

   This document specifies a mechanism to indicate which DNS zones are
   used for split-horizon DNS.  DNS clients can discover and
   authenticate encrypted DNS servers provided by the Enterprise
   network, for example using the techniques proposed in [I-D.ietf-add-
   dnr] and [I-D.ietf-add-ddr].  Discovery of encrypted DNS server for

   roaming enterprise endpoints is discussed in
   [I-D.btw-add-ipsecme-ike] (see Section 8).

   Provisioning Domains (PvDs) are defined in [RFC7556] as sets of
   network configuration information that clients can use to access
   networks, including rules for DNS resolution and proxy configuration.
   [RFC8801] defines a mechanism for discovering multiple Explicit PvDs
   on a single network and their Additional Information by means of an
   HTTP-over-TLS query using a URI derived from the PvD ID.  This set of
   additional configuration information is referred to as a Web
   Provisioning Domain (Web PvD).

   This document defines one PvD Key:

   The SplitDNSAllowed PvD Key:  which determines if the Enterprise
      network allows split-horizon DNS.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document makes use of the terms defined in [RFC8499].  The terms
   "Private DNS", "Global DNS" and "Split DNS" are defined in [RFC8499].

   'Encrypted DNS' refers to a DNS protocol that provides an encrypted
   channel between a DNS client and server (e.g., DoT, DoH, or DoQ).

   The term "enterprise network" in this document extends to a wide
   variety of deployment scenarios.  For example, an "enterprise" can be
   a Small Office, Home Office or Corporation.  The clients that connect
   to a enterprise network can securely authenticate that network and
   the client is sure that it has connected to the network it was
   expecting.

3.  Scope of the Document

   If a device is managed by an enterprise's IT department, the device
   can be configured to use a specific encrypted DNS server.  This
   configuration may be manual or rely upon whatever deployed device
   management tool in an Enterprise network.  For example, customizing
   Firefox using Group Policy to use the Enterprise DoH server is
   discussed in [Firefox-Policy] for Windows and MacOS, and setting
   Chrome policies is discussed in [Chrome-Policy] and [Chrome-DoH].

Internet-Draft       Split-Horizon DNS Configuration          March 2021


   If mobile device management (MDM) (e.g., [MDM-Apple]) secures a
   device, MDM can configure OS/browser with a specific encrypted DNS
   server.  If an endpoint is on-boarded, for example, using Over-The-
   Air (OTA) enrollment [OTA] to provision the device with a certificate
   and configuration profile, the configuration profile can include the
   authentication domain name (ADN) of the encrypted DNS server.  The
   OS/Browser can use the configuration profile to use a specific
   encrypted DNS server.  In this case, MDM is not installed on the
   device.

   Provisioning IT-managed devices, BYOD devices with MDM or
   configuration profile with the Split DNS configuration is outside the
   scope of this document.

   Typically, Enterprise networks do not assume that all devices in
   their network are managed by the IT team or MDM, especially in the
   quite common BYOD scenario.  The endpoint can use the discovered
   network-provided DNS server to only access DNS names for which the
   Enterprise network claims authority and use another public DNS server
   for global domains or use the discovered network-provided DNS server
   to access both private domains and global domains.

   The scope of this document is restricted to unmanaged BYOD devices
   without a configuration profile and split DNS configuration on
   explicitly trusted networks.  In this use case, the user has
   authorized the client to override local DNS settings for a specific
   network.  It is similar to the way users explicitly disable VPN
   connection in specific networks and VPN connection is enabled by
   default in other networks for privacy.  The unmanaged BYOD devices
   typically use the credentials (user name and password) provided by
   the IT admin to mutually authenticate to the Enterprise WLAN Access
   Point (e.g., PEAP-MSCHAPv2 [PEAP], EAP-pwd [RFC8146], EAP-PSK
   [RFC4764]).

   Note:   Many users have privacy and personal data sovereignty
      concerns with employers installing MDM on their personal devices;
      they are concerned that admin can glean personal information and
      could control how they use their devices.  When users do not
      install MDM on their devices, IT admins do not get visibility into
      the security posture of those devices.  To overcome this problem,
      a host agent can cryptographically attest the security status
      associated with device, such as minimum pass code length,
      biometric login enabled, OS version etc.  This approach is fast
      gaining traction especially with the advent of closed OS like
      Windows 10 in S mode [win10s] or Chromebook [Chromebook], where
      applications are sandboxed (e.g., ransomware attack is not
      possible) and applications can only be installed via the OS store.

Internet-Draft       Split-Horizon DNS Configuration          March 2021


4.  Split DNS

   [RFC2826] "does not preclude private networks from operating their
   own private name spaces" but notes that if private networks "wish to
   make use of names uniquely defined for the global Internet, they have
   to fetch that information from the global DNS naming hierarchy".

   There are various DNS deployments outside of the global DNS,
   including "split horizon" deployments and DNS usages on private (or
   virtual private) networks.  In a split horizon, an authoritative
   server gives different responses to queries from the Internet than
   they do to network-provided DNS servers; while some deployments
   differentiate internal queries from public queries by the source IP
   address, the concerns in Section 3.1.1 of [RFC6950] relating to
   trusting source IP addresses apply to such deployments.

   When the internal address space range is private [RFC1918], this
   makes it both easier for the server to discriminate public from
   private and harder for public entities to impersonate nodes in the
   private network.  The use cases that motivate split-horizon DNS
   typically involve restricting access to some network services --
   intranet resources such as internal web sites, development servers,
   or directories, for example -- while preserving the ease of use
   offered by domain names for internal users.

   An Enterprise can require one or more DNS domains to be resolved via
   network-provided DNS servers.  This can be a special domain, such as
   "corp.example.com" for an enterprise that is publicly known to use
   "example.com".  In this case, the endpoint needs to be informed what
   the private domain names are and what the IP addresses of the
   network-provided DNS servers are.  An Enterprise can also run a
   different version of its global domain on its internal network.  In
   that case, the client is instructed to send DNS queries for the
   enterprise public domain (e.g., "example.com") to the network-
   provided DNS servers.  A configuration for this deployment scenario
   is referred to as a Split DNS configuration.

   The PvD RA option defined in [RFC8801] SHOULD set the H-flag to
   indicate that Additional Information is available.  This Additional
   Information JSON object SHOULD include both the "dnsZones" and
   "SplitDNSAllowed" keys to define the DNS domains for which the
   Enterprise network claims authority and to indicate if the Enterprise
   network allows split-horizon DNS.

5.  PvD dnsZones

   As discussed in Section 4, the Enterprise internal resources tend to
   have private DNS names, an enterprise can also run a different
   version of its global domain on its internal network, and require the
   use of network-provided DNS servers to get resolved.

   The PvD Key dnsZones is defined in [RFC8801].  The PvD Key dnsZones
   adds support for DNS domains for which the Enterprise network claims
   authority.  These domains are intended to be resolved using network-
   provided DNS servers that are only reachable to the devices attached
   to the Enterprise network.  DNS resolution for other domains remains
   unchanged.

   The dnsZones PvD Key conveys the specified DNS domains that need to
   be resolved using an network-provided DNS server.  The private-only
   PvD Key conveys whether the domain is private or global but with a
   different version to the devices attached to the network.  The DNS
   root zone (".") MUST be ignored if it appears in dnsZones.  Other
   generic or global domains, such as Top-Level Domains (TLDs),
   similarly MUST be ignored if they appear in dnsZones.

   For each dnsZones entry, the client can use the network-provided DNS
   servers to resolve the listed domains and its subdomains.  Other
   domain names may be resolved using some other public resolvers that
   are configured independently.  For example, if the dnsZones key
   specifies "example.test", then "example.test", "www.example.test",
   and "mail.eng.example.test" can be resolved using the network-
   provided DNS resolver(s), but "otherexample.test" and "ple.test" can
   be resolved using the system's public resolver(s).

6.  PvD SplitDNSAllowed Key

   If an Enterprise network restricts all the DNS queries to be sent to
   the network-provided DNS server, SplitDNSAllowed will be set to
   false.

   Split DNS configurations may be preferable to sending all DNS queries
   to an network-provided DNS server in some deployments.  This allows
   an endpoint to only send DNS queries for the enterprise to the
   network-provided DNS servers.  The Enterprise remains unaware of all
   non-enterprise (DNS) activity of the user.  It also allows the
   network-provided DNS servers to only be configured for the enterprise
   DNS domains, which removes the legal and technical responsibility of
   the enterprise to resolve every DNS domain potentially asked for by
   the endpoints.

Internet-Draft       Split-Horizon DNS Configuration          March 2021


   If SplitDNSAllowed is set to false, the client should not trust the
   SplitDNSAllowed key in case of connecting to unknown or untrusted
   networks (e.g., coffee shops or hotel networks).  For example, if
   SplitDNSAllowed is set to false, client can choose to use a alternate
   network to resolve the global domain names.

7.  An Example

   The following example shows how the JSON keys defined in this
   document can be used:

      {
        "identifier": "cafe.example.com.",
        "expires": "2020-05-23T06:00:00Z",
        "prefixes": ["2001:db8:1::/48", "2001:db8:4::/48"],
        "SplitDNSAllowed": True,
         "dnsZones:": [{
             "name": "city.other.test",
             "private-only": true
         },{
             "name": "example.com",
             "private-only": false
         }]
      }

   The JSON keys "identifier", "expires", and "prefixes" are defined in
   [RFC8801].

8.  Roaming Enterprise Users

   In this Enterprise scenario (Section 1.1.3 of [RFC7296]), a roaming
   user connects to the Enterprise network through an VPN tunnel (e.g.,
   IPsec, SSL, Wireguard).  The split-tunnel Virtual Private Network
   (VPN) configuration allows the endpoint to access hosts that reside
   in the Enterprise network [RFC8598] using that tunnel; other traffic
   not destined to the Enterprise does not traverse the tunnel.  In
   contrast, a non-split- tunnel VPN configuration causes all traffic to
   traverse the tunnel into the Enterprise.

   When the VPN tunnel is IPsec, the encrypted server hosted by the
   Enterprise network can be securely discovered by the endpoint using
   the ENCDNS_IP*_* IKEv2 Configuration Payload Attribute Types defined
   in [I-D.btw-add-ipsecme-ike].  For split-tunnel VPN configurations,
   the endpoint uses the discovered encrypted DNS server to resolve
   domain names for which the Enterprise network claims authority.  For
   non-split-tunnel VPN configurations, the endpoint uses the discovered
   encrypted DNS server to resolve both global and private domain names.

Internet-Draft       Split-Horizon DNS Configuration          March 2021


   Other VPN tunnel types have similar configuration capabilities, not
   detailed here.

9.  Upstream Encryption

   If an Enterprise network is using a local encrypted DNS server
   configured as a Forwarding DNS server [RFC8499] relying upon the
   upstream resolver (e.g., at an ISP) to perform recursive DNS lookups,
   DNS messages exchanged between the local encrypted DNS server and the
   recursive resolver MUST be encrypted.

   If the Enterprise network is using the local encrypted DNS server
   configured as a recursive DNS server, DNS messages exchanges between
   the recursive resolver and authoritative servers SHOULD be encrypted
   to conform to the requirements discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-dprive-phase2-requirements].

10.  Security Considerations

   Clients may want to preconfigure global domains for TLDs and Second-
   Level Domains (SLDs) to prevent malicious DNS redirections for well-
   known domains.  This prevents users from unknowingly giving DNS
   queries to third parties.  This is even more important if those well-
   known domains are not deploying DNSSEC, as the Enterprise network
   could then even modify the DNS answers without detection.

   The content of dnsZones and SplitDNSAllowed may be passed to another
   (DNS) program for processing.  As with any network input, the content
   SHOULD be considered untrusted and handled accordingly.  The split
   DNS configuration assigned by an anonymous or unknown network (e.g.,
   coffee shops) MUST be ignored by the client.

   To comply with [RFC2826] the split-horizon DNS zone must either not
   exist in the global DNS hierarchy or must be authoritatively
   delegated to the split-horizon DNS server to answer.  To determine if
   the zone does not exist, the client can query a public resolver to
   identify if the domains specified in the dnsZones Key do not exist in
   the global DNS.  Authenticated denial of existence using NSEC3 or
   NSEC records can be used by a client to validate that a certain
   domain name does not exist in the global DNS.  [RFC7149] recommends
   validation of responses using NSEC3.  To handle scenario where the
   public resolver is not reachable (e.g., resolver is down or blocked
   by the network), the client can store the top well-known domain names
   and TLDs (e.g., [TOP]) locally (e.g., using Bloom filters) to
   determine if the entries in the dnsZones Key do not exist in the
   global DNS.  The local database of well-known domain names and TLDs
   needs to be updated periodically.

   An enterprise can run a different version of its public domain on its
   internal network.  If the domain specified in the dnsZones Key exists
   in the global DNS, the client needs to identify if any one of the
   network-provided encrypted resolvers [I-D.ietf-add-dnr] is
   authoritative of the domain.  The client can trigger a NS query of
   the domain and if the NS RRset matches the ADN of any one of the
   discovered network-provided encrypted DNS resolvers, the client can
   identify that the network-provided resolver whose ADN matches the NS
   response is authoritative for that domain.  The client can then
   establish a secure connection to authenticate the network-provided
   resolver and subsequently resolve the domains in the subtree using
   the network-provided resolver.

11.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add SplitDNSAllowed PvD Key to the Additional
   Information PvD Keys registry (https://www.iana.org/assignments/pvds/
