1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Introduction

   This document specifies the "median" URI scheme for the Glass to
   Glass Internet Ecosystem (GGIE -- see [I-D.deen-daigle-ggie]) media
   objects, as well as its use of S-NAPTR ([RFC3958]) to find Media
   Address Resolution Service (MARS -- to be described in a future
   Internet-Draft) servers for a given median URI.

   N.B.: there are significant design decisions still under discussion
   for the overall GGIE technology approach.  Depending on the outcome
   of those discussions -- e.g., on whether or how to determine the
   equivalence between two media objects -- the approach proposed in
   this document may be changed significantly.  Consider the use of
   S-NAPTR and domain names as placeholder proposals.

3.  The role and purpose of the median URI

   The median URI scheme is used to find one or more Media Encoding
   Network (MEN) instances for a given media object, within the domain
   of a particular video distributor.  (For a discussion of MEN, see the
   DASH MPEG MEN definition in [I-D.deen-naik-ggie-men-mpeg-dash]).
   Media objects are identified by industry-standard identifiers.  This
   document specifies the use of EIDR ("Entertainment Identifier

   Registry") identifiers ([ISO26234]) for identifying video content in
   median URIs.

   The components of the median URI are used to find the appropriate
   Media Address Resolution Service (MARS) server for the domain which
   is authoritative for that EIDR.

   It is important to note that the median URI does not identify ALL
   instances of MEN for a given EIDR.  Other domains may well have media
   encoding networks available for the video resource associated with
   the EIDR.

4.  median URI scheme definition

   This section fulfills the requirements for registration of the
   "median" URI scheme, per [RFC7595].

   For now, it is assumed that the median URI scheme is not hierarchical
   and is opaque.  As of this writing, it is assumed there is no need
   for relative URIs or queries and fragments as defined in the URI
   specification.

   ??? TBD: Re-read RFC7595 and make sure this document fulfills all
   requirements

   The median URI scheme has two main components: the identifier of the
   media that is sought, and the domain that will serve it.

   The intention is that existing media identifier schemes can be
   incorporated for use in the median URI scheme, rather than creating
   any new ones.  Therefore, the part of the media URI that handles the
   media identifier includes an indicator of the identifier type as well
   as the identifier itself.  In this document, we define the use "EIDR"
   identifiers.

   There may be many different domains that serve a given media object,
   in one or more formats.  The median URI includes the particular
   domain that should be consulted for the media network that has been
   identified.

   The basic syntax of the "median" URI scheme is as follows:

   median-uri = "median:" + media-ID-type + ":" +  media-ID + ":" + media-domain
   media-ID-type = "EIDR" | <others to be defined later;
        any valid URI character or percent encoded reserved character>
   media-ID = EIDR-ID | <to be defined later;
        any valid URI characters or percent encoded reserved characters>
   EIDR-ID = "10.5240%2F" + Specific-EIDR
   Specific-EIDR = 1*EIDR-chars
   EIDR-chars = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / "_"
   media-domain = <domain name for which to look for the MARS service>

   For example, the following median URI would be used to find the MEN
   associated with the movie "Despicable Me" in the example.com domain:

           median:EIDR:10.5240%2F6933-25C9-299D-671A-24FB-V:example.com

5.  Use of S-NAPTR for GGIE

   This section outlines the use of the S-NAPTR approach for finding
   MARS servers for a given median URI.  Consequently, it defines the
   MARS "application service" for S-NAPTR.

   Note that this is one method of discovering relevant MARS servers.
   Other methods may be defined (e.g., approaches that work directly
   from within web browsers).

5.1.  S-NAPTR components

   The S-NAPTR components are as follows:

   Application Unique String:  The Application Unique String used in
         S-NAPTR is the "media-domain" component from the median URI.

   Application Service:  The Application Service is "MARS", for "Media
         Address Resolution Service".

   Application Protocol:  Currently, the only S-NAPTR Application
         Protocol defined for use with the MARS Application Service is
         "http".

5.2.  S-NAPTR example

   For example, the MARS service for the URI
   "median:EIDR:10.5240%2F6933-25C9-299D-671A-24FB-V:example.com" could
   be found in the following NAPTR records: ??? need to update with
   appropriate protocol(s)

example.com.
   ;;       order pref flags
   IN NAPTR 100   10   "a"    "MARS:http"      (   ; service
                             ""                    ; regexp
                             mars.example.com.     ; replacement
                                               )
   IN NAPTR 100   20   "s"   "MARS:x-ldap"         ( ; service
                             ""                    ; regexp
                            _ldap._tcp.myldap.example.com. ; replacement
                                               )
   IN NAPTR 200   40   ""    "MARS:http"        ( ; service
                             ""                   ; regexp
                             someisp.example.     ; replacement
                                               )


   The example above provides 3 possible next steps for MARS service.

   1.  The lowest ORDER and PREF service for the "http" application
       protocol for MARS service, and is available at
       "mars.example.com", so the next step is to look up the address
       record for that domain.

   2.  Alternatively, if the client wants to use the "x-ldap"
       application protocol for MARS, the next step is to look up SRV
       records at "_ldap._tcp.myldap.example.com".

   3.  Finally, an alternate (perhaps, backup) MARS service is available
       at "someisp.example".  Since the FLAGS field is empty, the next
       step would be to look up NAPTR records for "someisp.example", to
       find available MARS services and protocols.

5.3.  After S-NAPTR...

   After using the S-NAPTR approach, the client should have a pointer to
   a usable MARS server, which can be queried for the relevant
   information about MEN for the EIDR in the median URI.  That process
   will be covered in the MARS definition document.

6.  Acknowledgements

   Forthcoming.

7.  IANA Considerations

   There will be IANA considerations for the registration of the
   "median" URI scheme.

   There will be IANA considerations for the registration of S-NAPTR
   application services and protocols -- MARS and ???.

8.  Security Considerations

   None (yet).
