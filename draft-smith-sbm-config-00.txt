Abstract

This memo includes a list of manageable parameters for RSVP and SBM
implementations.  These are in addition to those already described in
RFC 2206 and RFC 2213. Specifically, it describes parameters for control
of the base signaling protocols themselves, as well as a basic set of
parameters for control of policy decisions by a Local Policy Module.
These are not intended to be exhaustive lists but they have been
identified as useful for practical implementations.

Internet Draft               SBM Parameters                February 1999


1.  Introduction

SBM components of the ISSLL/IS802 architecture require some
configuration parameters for operational use.  These fall into 2 main
areas: configuration of RSVP protocol operation and configuration of
SBM-specifics.  For the former, RFC 2206 and RFC 2213 cover some
configuration operations as SNMP MIBS and some more are listed here.
There are currently no proposals for the latter and some are offered
here for discussion.

In addition, admission policy decisions need to be managed. The RSVP
architecture accomodates both policy decisions made locally at the RSVP
node ("Local Policy Module" or LPM) and also the outsourcing of policy
decisions to another Policy Server node ("Policy Decision Point" or PDP)
using the COPS protocol. The work of the IETF's RAP WG covers the latter
scenario in detail. The former is not covered by any current proposals
and so some suggestions for a simple set of manageable objects, focussed
on LPM decisions made in an RSVP/SBM context, are proposed here.



2.  Editorial information

<this section will be removed before publication>

2.1.  Issues requiring further consideration

(1)  The "LPM" parts of this are probably just for use when policy is
     not to be outsourced via COPS although I can conceive of scenarios
     where you might have a mix of LPM and PDP making decisions e.g. you
     might care a lot more about accuracy on Guaranteed admissions than
     you do about Controlled Load ones. The LPM parts can, therefore, be
     considered seperable from the whole.

(2)  Not sure about the bandwidth % vs. absolute bps parameters. It is
     painful to write absolute-b/w rules in auto-sensing environments
     when you don't know the available link bandwidth until run-time.
     Might need to duplicate some of these.

(3)  Granularity on many of objects needs to be determined - per-port,
     per-subnet or per-system: suggestions are offered.

(4)  This is a bit confused about delay/slack terms - probably need to
     match up pragmatic needs vs. what the GS specs and MIBs say about
     this.

6.  Security Considerations

There are a number of management objects defined in this memo that are
writeable.  Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in
some network environments. The support for modify operations in a non-
secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect
on network operations.
