Abstract

   This document reserves the 'xri' Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
   scheme for URIs mapped from Extensible Resource Identifiers (XRIs)
   via its formal registration.

1. Introduction

   Extensible Resource Identifiers (XRIs) are a way of abstractly
   identifying a resource independently of any particular concrete
   representation of it.  They are designed to suit Requirements for
   Uniform Resource Names (URNs), laid out in [RFC1737], even though
   they are not URNs [RFC2141] themselves.

   The comprehensive XRI specification includes 3 documents:
   [XRISyntax], which is the normative technical specification of XRI
   generic syntax, [XRIResolution], which defines an optional HTTP-based
   resolution protocol for XRIs, and [XRIMetadata], which defines four
   namespaces under the XRI global context symbol "$" for common types
   of identifier metadata.  See [XRIIntro] for non-normative description
   of XRIs and [XRIFaq] for FAQ on XRIs.  XRI requirements and glossary
   are defined in [XRIReq].

   [XRISyntax], Section 2.3.1 specifies rules for transforming XRI
   references to URI [RFC3986] and Internationalized Resource
   Identifiers (IRIs) [RFC3987] references.  It mentions that URIs
   mapped from XRIs use the "xri" scheme name.  It has been noted that
   this scheme name is not officially registered with IANA, as described
   in [RFC4395].  This document removes the uncertainty by formal
   registration of the 'xri' URI scheme.

1.1. Community Consensus

   The Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information
   Standards (OASIS) has the Technical Committee (TC), which is
   responsible for developing and maintaining XRI specifications, - XRI
   TC.  This document has been prepared for this TC and has received its
   excessive review, which revealed wide consensus of the TC's members.

   [IMPORTANT: Currently, this document is only a subject for the
   aforementioned review; the paragraph above actually does not
   represent TC consensus.]

2. Registration Template for 'xri' URI Scheme

   This section contains the registration template for 'xri' URI scheme,
   as required by [RFC4395].

     URI scheme name: xri

     Status: Permanent

3. Security Considerations

   Security considerations for XRIs are discussed in Section 3 of
   [XRISyntax] and Section 18 of [XRIResolution].

4. IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to register the 'xri' URI scheme using the template of
   Section 2.
