   The International Standard Audiovisual Number (ISAN) is a standard 
   numbering system for the unique and international identification of 
   audiovisual works. This document is the definition of the formal 
   Uniform Resource Name (URN) Namespace Identifier (NID) for ISAN.  

Conventions used in this document 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

1. URN Namespace Definition Template 

   The following template is provided in accordance with [RFC3406]. 

1.1. Namespace ID: 

   ISAN 

1.2. Registration Information: 

   Version: 1 

   Date: 2004 11 22 

1.3. Declared registrant of the namespace: 

   Name:    ISAN International Agency 
   Address: 26 rue de St Jean, CH-1203 Geneva û Switzerland 

   Contact: Mr. Patrick Attallah, Managing Director

Internet-Draft           ISAN URN Definition                 April 2005 
    

1.4. Declaration of structure: 

   The identifier structure is as follows: 

      URN:ISAN:<ISAN-NSS> 

   Where ISAN-NSS is conformant to URN syntax requirements defined in 
   [RFC2141] and is further constrained by [ISO15706] and in this 
   document.  There are two forms, one with the version extension and 
   one without.  The formal BNF is defined in section 2 below.  Examples 
   of the two forms are: 

      URN:ISAN:0123-1230-3210-2310-1 

      URN:ISAN:1881-66C7-3420-6541-9-9F3A-0245-U 

1.5. Relevant ancillary documentation: 

   ISAN, its syntax, uses and its processes are defined in [ISO15706]. 

1.6. Identifier uniqueness considerations: 

   Uniqueness is guaranteed by the ISAN International Agency that issues 
   the numbers.  Numbers are not re-assigned. 

1.7. Identifier persistence considerations: 

   Persistence is guaranteed by ISO Registration Authority processes and 
   contracts with the ISAN International Agency. 

1.8. Process of identifier assignment: 

   The details of the assignment process are defined from time to time 
   by the ISAN International Agency.  However, in general, any approved 
   entity can request an ISAN number by providing the required metadata 
   information and paying the registration fee. The ISAN International 
   Agency may delegate to regional or market-based Registration Agencies 
   for portions of the registration process. 

1.9. Process for identifier resolution: 

   ISAN numbers are resolved by a direct or indirect lookup with the 
   ISAN International Agency.  At this writing, a non-commercial, manual 
   system is available online at http://www.isan.org.  The resolution 
   procedures may be modified from time to time by the ISAN 
   International Agency. 

1.10. Rules for Lexical Equivalence: 

   The ISAN-NSS is unique by the nature of the ISAN International 
   AgencyÆs number management.  The ISAN-NSS is case-insensitive.  Upper 
   and lower case characters are treated as identical. 

1.11. Conformance with URN Syntax: 

   No special considerations. The syntax is fully conformant with 
   [RFC2141].

1.12. Validation mechanism: 

   The check digits provide syntax integrity. Lookup is via online and 
   offline services provided by the ISAN International Agency. 

1.13. Scope: Global. 

2. Formal Syntax 

   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur 
   Form (BNF) and elements defined in the URN Syntax [RFC2141]. This 
   syntax here is derived from the syntax definition in [ISO15706], 
   constrained to prohibit the space character as a separator. 

      <ISAN-NSS>     ::= <root> <episode> [version] 

      <root>         ::= 3*(<hexnum> "-") 

      <episode>      ::= <hexnum> "-" <check> 

      <version>      ::= 2*("-" <hexnum>) "-" <check> 

      <hexnum>       ::= 4*(<hex>) 

      <check>        ::= <upper> | <lower> | <number> 

   Note that <hex>, <upper>, <lower> and <number> are defined in 
   [RFC2141]. 

3. Security Considerations 

   This document only defines the syntax and resolution authority for 
   the ISAN numbers. Details of the resolution process and the security 
   of the assignment and resolution system processes are defined 
   external to this document by the ISAN International Agency and thus 
   outside the scope of this document. 

4. Namespace Considerations 
   ISAN is an external numbering system managed by an external agency 
   established by ISO. While URN namespaces may exist for which any 
   generic numbering system can be encoded, there is currently no direct 
   encoding for ISAN. An example of such a namespace is the MPEG-21 
   system. 

   ISAN numbers are reserved for use in identifying audiovisual works 
   for which there is a moving visual component, or components related 
   to such a work (e.g. subtitling track). 

5. Community Considerations 

   The primary registrants for ISAN numbers are the producers and 
   studios of audiovisual works (movies and television shows). While the 
   system is not constrained to "major" works (any bona fide entity can 
   register any work), the primary benefits of its use come from works 
   that are widely distributed. The users of the ISAN system range from 
   the studios themselves to film and video archives and libraries, 
   rights administrators, program guide services, and audience

   measurement services. Its potential for use in the Internet community 
   is as an identifier for streaming media. 

6. IANA Considerations 

   This document defines a URN NID registration that is to be entered 
   into the IANA registry of URN NIDs. It specifically requests the NID, 
   "ISAN".
