          The LoST-Validation S-NAPTR Application Service Tag
                    draft-gellens-lost-validation-07

Abstract

   This document adds the "LoST-Validation" service tag to the
   Straightforward Naming Authority PoinTeR (S-NAPTR) Application
   Service Tag IANA registry.  This tag can appear in a Naming Authority
   Pointer (NAPTR) Domain Name System (DNS) record to assist clients of
   the Location-to-Service Translation Protocol (LoST) in identifying
   LoST servers explicitly willing to perform location validation.

1.  Document Scope

   This document adds 'LoST-Validation' to the S-NAPTR Application
   Service Tag IANA registry, and describes how this tag fits in the
   LoST server discovery procedure described in [RFC5222].  This tag is
   used with Naming Authority Pointer (NAPTR) Domain Name System (DNS)
   records so that clients of the Location-to-Service Translation
   Protocol (LoST) [RFC5222] can identify servers explicitly willing to
   perform location validation.

2.  Introduction

   The Location-to-Service Translation Protocol, LoST [RFC5222] defines
   a mapping service with the additional ability for a client to request
   that a civic address be validated.  The LoST protocol allows servers
   to ignore a request to perform location validation.  The National
   Emergency Number Association (NENA) has defined an architecture for
   all-IP emergency services (known as "i3" [NENA-i3]), which defines
   the mapping (routing) and validation functions as two distinct
   functional elements, defined as an Emergency Call Routing Function
   (ECRF) and a Location Validation Function (LVF).  NENA i3 requires
   that the mapping (ECRF) and validation (LVF) functions be separable,



Gellens & Rosen         Expires November 12, 2020               [Page 2]

   so that an entity responsible for a LoST server cluster can decide to
   provide mapping and validation services using consolidated or
   separate server clusters (i.e., using the same or separate boxes).
   The rationale is that the mapping service is used in real-time during
   emergency call routing, while the validation service is used in
   advance, typically when data is provisioned, and therefore the
   mapping service has much higher availability and response time
   requirements than the validation service.  An organization might
   choose to deploy these services using different server clusters to
   make it easier to provide higher levels of service for the mapping
   function while shielding it from the potentially bursty load of
   validation, while another organization might choose to use the same
   sets of servers for both, configured and deployed to offer the high
   service level demanded of the mapping service.

   In order to permit this separability, any entity querying a LoST
   server needs to be able to resolve an Application Unique String (AUS)
   into a URL for a LoST server that offers the required service
   (mapping or validation).  This separability needs to be maintained
   throughout the LoST tree structure, from forest guide to leaf node
   (LoST architecture is described in [RFC5582]).  Because LoST
   referrals return an AUS rather than a URL, either a different Service
   Tag or a DNS name convention (e.g., "ecrf.example.org" and
   "lvf.example.org") is needed to differentiate the different services.
   DNS name conventions are inflexible and fragile, making a different
   service tag the preferred approach.

   Because a server discovered using the "LoST" application service tag
   may ignore a request to perform location validation, a service tag
   explicitly for location validation also reduces the likelihood (which
   has existed since [RFC5582]) of a client requiring location
   validation reaching servers unwilling to do so.

3.  The LoST-Validation Application Service Tag

   This document adds 'LoST-Validation' to the S-NAPTR Application
   Service Tag registry created by [RFC3958].  The 'LoST-Validation' tag
   serves as a counterpart to the 'LoST' tag added by [RFC5222]: The
   'LoST' tag identifies servers able to perform the core mapping
   function, while 'LoST-Validation' identifies servers explicitly
   willing to perform the validation function.

   Because some servers might be configured to provide both mapping and
   validation functions, a server identified using the 'LoST' service
   tag might also perform the validation function (and resolving the two
   tags might result in the same URL).  Because the two functions might
   be separate, clients seeking a LoST server for location validation
   can first try U-NAPTR resolution using the 'Lost-Validation' service

   tag, and fallback to the 'LoST' service tag if this does not resolve
   to a usable LoST server.

   LoST [RFC5222] specifies that LoST servers are located by resolving
   an application Unique String (AUS) using U-NAPTR/DDDS (URI-Enabled
   NAPTR/Dynamic Delegation Discovery Service) [RFC4848], and defines
   the 'LoST' Application service tag.  In order to permit separability
   of the mapping and validation services performed using LoST, and to
   reduce the likelihood of a client requiring location validation
   reaching servers unwilling to do so, this document defines the 'LoST-
   Validation' service tag.  NAPTR records for LoST servers available
   for location validation contain the 'LoST-Validation' service tag.
   An entity needing to perform location validation using LoST performs
   the discovery procedure as described in [RFC5222], except that the
   'LoST-Validation' service tag is used in preference to the 'LoST'
   service tag.  For both service tags, the HTTP and HTTPS URL schemes
   are used.  In the absense of any NAPTR records containing the 'LoST-
   Validation' service tag, the 'LoST' service tag is used.  Fallback to
   the 'LoST' service tag may follow if the 'Lost-Validation' service
   tag fails to result in a usable LoST server.  The discovery procedure
   with the 'LoST-Validation' service tag might result in the same URL
   as the 'LoST' service tag, or it may result in a different URL.  When
   the URLs are different, they could lead to the same physical servers,
   or different servers.

4.  Backwards Compatability

   The primary use of LoST in general, and the location validation
   functionality in particular, is within the emergency services area.
   Within North America, the NENA i3 [NENA-i3] document specifies how
   protocols including LoST are used.  The i3 document is expected to
   reference the 'LoST-Validation' service tag, and specify its use in
   both server NAPTR DNS records and client resolution of Application
   Unique Strings (AUS).

   LoST allows a server to refuse to perform location validation, and
   defines the 'locationValidationUnavailable' warning.  LoST also
   allows a server to refer to another server rather than answering
   itself.  So, in a deployment where a LoST tree has separate server
   clusters for mapping and for validation, mapping servers receiving a
   request for validation could either perform the validation as
   requested, or return the 'locationValidationUnavailable' warning, and
   potentially also include a <redirect> element to redirect to a
   validation server.  However, the <redirect> element contains an
   Application Unique String, so unless the AUSs for validation and
   mapping are different (e.g., 'ecrf.example.org' and
   'lvf.example.org'), we still need a different service tag to allow

   for flexible deployment choices (i.e., not requiring a DNS name
   convention).

   LoST clients performing emergency services operations are expected to
   comply with the latest NENA i3 specification, and hence support the
   'LoST-Validation' service tag when defined.  A LoST client
   implemented prior to the addition of the 'LoST-Validation' tag would
   use the 'LoST' tag to resolve an AUS.  Such a client might not be
   performing location validation, but if it is, the LoST server it
   contacts may perform the service.  Even in a deployment where mapping
   and validation are split, the data is identical; the split is a load
   and deployment optimization strategy.  The server designated for
   mapping is likely to perform validation when requested, potentially
   unless it is under load.  If an older client attempts validation
   using a designated mapping server that refuses the request, the
   client will retry later, at which point the server may no longer be
   under load and may provide the function.  Even in the (unlikely) case
   of a designated mapping server that refuses to perform validation at
   any time, the server could return a redirect with a different AUS
   (e.g., "lvf.example.com") that resolves to a designated validation
   server.  In the (unlikely) worst case, the client will be unable to
   reach a server willing to perform validation, and will submit a
   discrepancy report, as specified in NENA i3.  The discrepancy report
   resolution would be to update the client with the 'LoST-Validation'
   service tag, update the AUS returned in a redirect and DNS to use a
   different DNS host name, or permit the server to perform validation
   when not under stress (or a combination).  Note that, because LoST
   does not require servers to perform validation, the situation
   described can exist regardless of the addition of the 'LoST-
   Validation' service tag.  The addition of the tag improves the
   likelihood of a client needing validation being able to do so.

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations described in [RFC3958], [RFC4848], and
   [RFC5222] apply here.  No additional security aspects are foreseen by
   the addition of an extra tag.  Separation of services might be
   desired, for example, to be able to allocate different levels of
   resources (such as server capacity, attack mitigation, bandwidth,
   etc.) to the mapping and validation services, in which case separate
   tags are needed to allow LoST clients (which may include other LoST
   servers) to identify the correct server cluster.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add 'LoST-Validation' to the S-NAPTR Application
   Service Tag registry created by [RFC3958]  This tag serves as a
   counterpart to the 'LoST' tag added by [RFC5222].

   Service Tags" while [RFC5222] calls it "U-NAPTR application service
