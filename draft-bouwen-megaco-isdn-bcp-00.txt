1. Abstract

   A Media Gateway with ISDN terminations will use both Megaco [1] and
   Sigtran protocols for communication with the Media Gateway
   Controller. In an ISDN Access Gateway the media carrying B-channels
   are controlled by the Media Gateway Controller using Megaco, while
   the User-to-Network signalling running over the D-channels will be
   relayed to the Media Gateway Controller using Sigtran protocols (IUA
   [3] over SCTP [2]).
   At the moment, in the absence of appropriate specifications, the
   Megaco and Sigtran protocols may interact in different ways in the
   Access Gateway, leaving room for non-interoperable solutions.
   This draft proposes a set of guidelines for the Megaco-Sigtran
   interworking, documenting a best current practice for ISDN Access
   Gateways.

3. ISDN Termination Terminology and ISDN Media Gateway Architecture

   This section defines basic ISDN terminology based on Q.920 [5] and
   I.412 [6].

   An ISDN termination typically exists of a number of B channels and
   one D channel.

   A B-channel is a 64 kbit/s channel for the transfer of user
   information streams

   A D-channel carries signaling information for circuit switching by
   the ISDN.

   Typical ISDN interface structures are:

   Basic access (BA)
        2B+D
        ETSI, ANSI
        The bit rate of the D-channel in this interface structure is 16
        kbit/s

   2048 kbit/s Primary rate access (PRA):
        30B+D
        ETSI
        The bit rate of the D-channel in the primary rate access
        structure is 64 kbit/s

   1544 kbit/s Primary rate interface (PRI)
        23B+D
        ANSI
        The bit rate of the D-channel in the primary rate interface
        structure is 64 kbit/s

   The D-channel uses a layered protocol according to ITU-T
   recommendations Q.920, Q.921, Q.930 and Q.931. The Q.921 Data Link
   uses the DLCI to identify a connection. Figure 1 shows the use of
   the DLCI.

   DLCI        Data Link Connection Identifier
               An address conveyed in a Q.921 message which indicates
               the source and destination of an intended instance of
               communication at the data link layer
               The DLCI is the combination of the TEI and the SAPI

   SAPI        Service Access Point Identifier
               Portion of the DLCI associated with the service access
               point on the network side or the user side of the user-
               network interface. The Service Access Point is the point
               at which the Q.921 data link layer provides services to
               layer 3 (Q.931).

   TEI         Terminal Endpoint Identifier
               Portion of a DLCI associated with one (point-to-point
               data link) or more than one (broadcast data link)
               terminal equipment. The TEI is used to identify a
               specific connection endpoint within a Service Access
               Point.

   Signaling information arrives in the ISDN Access Gateway over the D-
   channel, and has to be forwarded to the call control intelligence in
   the Media Gateway Controller. In this way an ISDN Access Gateway
   contains Signaling Gateway functionality.

4. Naming of ISDN Terminations

   The Megaco/H.248 protocol specification doesn't contain any
   recommendation for the naming of terminations. The attribution of
   names is a matter of implementation.
   However, the adoption of a consistent naming scheme of ISDN
   terminations simplifies configuration of Media Gateways and Media
   Gateway Controllers, and facilitates their interoperability. The
   extension of a Media Gateway with new terminations - a current
   practice in Access Gateways - can be more easily automated.

   The following expression defines a partial naming pattern for ISDN
   terminations. It only specifies the final part of the name,
   identifying the type of ISDN termination.

   ... / [BA[1-{#BA}] / [D, B[1-2]],
               PRI[1-{#PRI}] / [D[1-2], B[1-24]],
               PRA[1-{#PRA}] / [D, B[1-30]]
              ]

   Examples of termination names constructed according to this scheme:

   .../BA93/B1
   .../PRI17/B18
   .../PRI22/D
   .../PRA88/B28

   The use of D1 and D2 in a PRI is optional. It is intended to
   differentiate between the primary and backup D-channel, when the
   latter is present.

   The naming pattern can be pre-configured in both the Media Gateway
   and the Media Gateway Controller, or the Media Gateway Controller
   can use the Name Pattern Package [8] to retrieve the name pattern
   implemented by the Media Gateway.


5. Visibility of the D-channel for Megaco

   The Megaco implementation can be unaware of the existence of D-
   channels, and only be involved with the establishment of media
   contexts containing B-channels. It is however preferred to make the
   D-channels visible for Megaco for management purposes. Megaco should
   not be used to perform connection control on D-channels (i.e. moving
   D-channels in and out of contexts). The visibilty of the D-channel
   is intended to
   * allow use of ServiceChange on the D-channel
   * allow auditing of the D-channel
   * use events/signals on the D-channel for the layer 1 activation/
     deactivation procedure

6. ISDN Signaling Backhaul

   In the decomposed architecture of Media Gateways and Media Gateway
   Controllers, the call control intelligence resides in the Media
   Gateway Controller. This implies the call control signaling, which
   is transported in the SCN over the D-channel as Q.931 messages, has
   to be relayed from the Media Gateway to the Media Gateway Controller
   and vice versa. The signaling transport protocols developed in the
   Sigtran WG are used for this purpose.

   It involves the generic signaling transport protocol SCTP [2], and
   the ISDN Q.921 Adaptation Layer (IUA) [3]. Figure 2 shows the
   envisaged architecture. An SCTP association is set up between the
   Media Gateway and the Media Gateway Controller for the relay of
   Q.931 signaling and Q.921 management information. The SCTP
   association contains unidirectional streams.
   * Every D-channel is mapped to an MG->MGC stream and an MGC->MG
     stream.
   * For a particular D-channel, the same stream identification number
     in both directions should be used.

   The Media Gateway Controller uses Megaco/H.248 to create and remove
   media contexts containing B-channel terminations. Signaling
   associated with the B-channels is transferred between Media Gateway
   and Media Gateway Controller as unmodified Q.931 binary messages.

7. Synchronisation of Megaco ServiceChange and SCTP Association
   initiation/termination

   At start-up the Media Gateway informs the Media Gateway Controller
   of its existence with a Megaco/H.248 ServiceChange message. The next
   step is the initiation of an SCTP association for the signaling
   backhaul, assuming that no SCTP association has been created between
   the Media Gateway Controller and the ISDN acces gateway as a
   transport layer for the megaco/H.248 protocol. In case the
   megaco/H.248 protocol uses one or more SCTP streams, one should take
   care that different stream identifiers are used for the Q.931
   backhauling and for the streams used by the megaco/H.248 protocol.
   Table 1 lists the dependencies between ServiceChange messages and
   the management of the SCTP association.

   Remark:

   The synchronization requirements for a Restart, a Graceful or Forced
   Shutdown are valid when the complete Media Gateway is affected (i.e.
   the referenced termination is 'root'), or when the complete set of
   available ISDN terminations is involved (i.e. the ISDN part of the
   Media Gateway). For the restart of shutdown of one ISDN termination,
   no changes in the SCTP association are required (since once the SCTP

   association has been established, there is no need to set up or tear
   down the flows inside the association).


8. ServiceChange for Blocking/Unblocking

   The ServiceChange methods and servicechange reasons currently
   defined in Megaco/H.248 are sufficient to support the
   blocking/unblocking capabilities currently offered by the V5
   specification. Table 2 maps Megaco ServiceChange methods and reasons

   Remark 1: Termination reference

   Blocking and unblocking messages refer to the complete ISDN
   termination (B-channels and D-channel), and will for example contain
   a termination identifier of the form .../BA17/*.

   D-channel blocking and unblocking only influences the D-channel. The
   termination identifier will look like .../BA17/D.

   passed. New ServiceChange reasons 'Normal Performance' and 'Degraded
   Performance level X' have to be defined for this purpose, to be used
   with Restart and Forced ServiceChange methods. The newly defined
   reasons will have to be registered with IANA.


9. Layer 1 Management

   In ISDN access gateway architectures, the layer 1 functionality for
   Basic Interfaces is split between the access gateway and the entity
   containing call control (the local exchange). The Media Gateway
   Controller is informed by the Media Gateway about the layer 1
   availability of the ISDN termination (operational/non-operational).
   In addition, the Media Gateway Controller supports the
   activation/deactivation procedure for Basic Interfaces, as defined
   in ITU Recommendation I.430 [4]. Primary Rate Interfaces are
   permanently activated.

   Maintenance of the Access Digital Section and customer lines is the
   responsibility of the Media Gateway. The operation of loopbacks or
   activation/deactivation of the digital section is controlled only by
   the Media Gateway. No information related to these functions
   is transmitted to the Media Gateway Controller.

   The transfer of messages for the layer 1 management with the
   event/signal mechanism is defined in the ISDN package for Megaco[7].

   Layer 2 activation/deactivation is managed with the use of IUA
   messages.


10. Conclusion

   This draft proposes a set of guidelines to be considered as best
   current practice for ISDN access gateways that use both Megaco and
   Sigtran (IUA/SCTP) to communicate with a Media Gateway Controller.
   The adoption of the guidelines will ensure interoperability between
   access gateways and media gateway controllers.
