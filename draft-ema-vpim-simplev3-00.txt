   1.  Abstract 

     This document proposes an alternative simple approach to VPIM v3.

   2.  Introduction
     Voice messaging transport over Internet Mail is defined by VPIM v2 
     (RFC 2421)[1].

     The original detailed proposal for VPIM v3 is contained in [10].

     This Internet Draft details a proposed simpler approach at VPIM v3. 
     It is intended to follow the baseline goals described in [5].  Given 
     that VPIM v2 [1] is a well defined (or will be when it is revised for 
     clarity and maturity elevation) description of networking voice-only 
     systems using Internet Mail, and that Internet Mail is being used as-is 
     for multimedia messaging, there is minimal need for a detailed 
     revision.of VPIM to support Unified Messaging.
     
     It is proposed, that all that is needed is an agreement to use 
     Internet Mail without modification and profile a minimal set of Internet 
     Mail standard features that a VPIM v3 compliant system MUST support.  As 
     all devices become connected with email, VPIM v3 compliance will ensure 
     the ability to communicate voice messages between these devices.

   3.  Conventions Used in this Document

     The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", and "MAY"
     in this document are to be interpreted as defined in "Key words for
     use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels" [2].

   4.  Message Format

     All messages MUST conform with the Internet Mail format as 
     described in DRUMS [12].  Any content type is allowed to be in a 
     message.
     
     The top level content type on origination of a new, forwarded or 
     reply message SHOULD typically be either multipart/mixed or 
     multipart/voice-message.
     
     The top level content type on origination of a delivery 
     notification message MUST be either multipart/report.
     
     An implementation MAY use the multipart/voice-message content type 
     as described in [6] to package audio content together as a voice 
     message.

   5.  Transport

     All transport MUST support Internet Mail transport (SMTP/ESMTP) as 
     described in DRUMS [11].

   6.  Addressing

     Any valid Internet Mail address MAY be used.  

     However, VPIM onramp and offramp implementations MAY require a 
     stricter addressing structure [7].  As a result, the VPIM addressing 
     structure of [7] MUST be supported for recipient addresses in inbound 
     messages and SHOULD be supported for the originator address if required.
     
     Discovery of an Internet Mail address for a recipientÿs voice mail 
     box (if applicable) SHOULD be supported by only knowing the E.164 phone 
     number of the recipient.  (Details of the DNS/LDAP mechanism TBD) 

   7.  Notifications

     DSN MUST be supported.  All non-delivery of messages MUST result 
     in a NDN. Partial DSNs (to indicate that one or more contents could not 
     be stored/relayed by the receiving MTA) SHOULD be supported.
     
     MDN MUST be supported.  Partial MDNs (to indicate that one or more 
     contents could not be rendered) SHOULD be supported.

   8.  Voice Contents

     Voice messages may be contained at any location within a message and 
     MUST be contained in an audio/* content-type.  The parameters described 
     in [1] MUST be used to identify them as voice messages or spoken names. 
     
     The originators spoken name SHOULD be included with a message.  
     Spoken names (for originators and recipients) MAY be included as 
     separate audio contents.  These MAY be referenced from the message 
     header or a vCard.   Spoken names MAY also be included inline with a 
     vCard.  External references SHOULD NOT be used.
     
     Any voice codec may be used.  An implementation SHOULD determine the 
     recipient capabilities before the sending of a message if possible and 
     choose a codec accordingly (a CONNEG and RESCAP profile is needed).  In 
     the absence of recipient knowledge, implementations:
     
     MUST play:     G.726  - audio/32kadpcm or audio/wav; codec=64
                    G.711  - audio/basic or audio/wav; codec=7 
                    MS-GSM - audio/msgsm or audio/wav; codec=31
     
     SHOULD encode: G.726  - audio/32kadpcm or audio/wav; codec=64
                    G.711  - audio/basic or audio/wav; codec=7 
                    MS-GSM - audio/msgsm or audio/wav; codec=31
     
     An implementation MUST be able to play either of the three codecs 
     (either natively or via transcoding) and MUST be able to record and 
     encode messages in at least one of them.  Note that the codecs may 
     appear natively or with a WAVE RIFF header (the codec parameter SHOULD 
     be used on origination so cannot be guaranteed for the recipient).

    9.  IMAP 

     Implementations SHOULD support access to the voice message store using 
     IMAP [3].  The voice extensions described in [9] SHOULD be supported.

   10.  Backwards compatibility with VPIM v2 

     Because of the wide deployed base of VPIM v2, implementations are 
     encouraged to send messages in a format compatible with VPIM v2 systems 
     as described in [1].  Simply, record and encode audio/32kadpcm under a 
     top level multipart/voice-message.  
     
     If a VPIM v3 system has knowledge that the recipient system is 
     VPIM v2 (via CONNEG, RESCAP, LDAP, etc.) it MUST send a VPIM v2 message.
     
     A VPIM v2 system SHOULD reject a message it cannot render with a 
     DSN indicating the media is unsupported.  A VPIM v3 compliant system 
     SHOULD record this information for future sending, and SHOULD resend the 
     original message in a VPIM v2 format.
