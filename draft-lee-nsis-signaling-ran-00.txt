Abstract

   The IETF NSIS WG is standardizing IP signaling protocols with QoS
   signaling as the first use case. It is desirable to consider QoS
   signaling procedures for resource reservations in an IP-based RAN
   where mobide nodes undergo frequent handoffs. In this draft, we
   describe general QoS signaling procedures for an IP-based RAN, which
   are based on the analysis of the existing QoS signaling solutions in
   mobile wireless networks. We also present a specific QoS signaling
   scheme based on the proposed general signaling procedures.

1. Introduction

   There has been intensive research in the area of mobile computing to
   provide mobile users access to the Internet. The rapidly growing
   popularity of IP and its flexibility make it a good candidate for
   transmission in radio access networks (RANs) which provide the radio
   access to mobile nodes (MNs)[7].

   Recently, there is a growing interest in supporting real-time
   services in mobile wireless networks. In order for the real-time
   services to function satisfactorily in an IP-based RAN, we need to
   ensure that there are adequate resources on the links available in
   the RAN even after handoff. Since mobility of hosts has significant
   impact on the quality of service (QoS) provided to a real-time
   service, it is necessary to provide mobility independent service
   guarantees. To achieve this, resources should be reserved along the
   new paths in a very fast manner. Pre-allocation of resources at all
   locations it may visit during the lifetime of the connection would be
   one solution. However, in this case, too much bandwidth may be
   wasted.

   Although the well-known resource reservation protocol, RSVP
   [1], sets up resource reservation for realí¨time traffic in the
   Internet, RSVP is not adequate to make resource reservations for
   mobile hosts. If RSVP is used in the mobile Internet, a change in the
   location of the MN may make the reserved path useless and a new path
   has to be established. This overhead results in inefficient use of
   network resources and also introduces additional delay.

   To overcome the drawbacks of RSVP, many solutions have been proposed
   which are based on the modification or extension of RSVP [4, 5, 6].
   However, most RSVP-based solutions for mobility support yet do not
   have appropriate QoS mechanisms in preventing service disruption at a
   new location during handoff.

   The IETF NSIS WG is currently working on general signaling protocols
   based on the signaling requirements and framework. It is desirable to
   consider general signaling procedures for resource reservations in an
   IP-based RAN. In this draft, we describe general QoS signaling
   procedures for an IP-based RAN, which are based on the analysis of
   the existing QoS signaling solutions in mobile wireless networks. We
   also present a specific QoS signaling scheme based on the proposed
   general signaling procedures.

1.1 Problem Statement

   Most existing work on QoS guarantees for the Internet did not
   consider the mobility issue. The mobility problem is concerned with

   maintaining a flow path when the MN moves around geographically. When
   an MN undergoes handoff from one access router (AR) to another, the
   path traversed by the MN's packet stream in the network may change.
   Such a change needs to be limited (or localized) to a small segment
   of the end-to-end path near the extremity, or it could also have an
   end-to-end impact. It is also important to rapidly re-reserve
   resources along the new path after handoff to minimize the impact of
   handoff on QoS. In addition, the packets belonging to the MN's
   ongoing session may start using a new care-of address (CoA) after
   handoff. Therefore, they may not be recognized by some forwarding
   functions in the nodes even along that segment of the end-to-end path
   that remains unaltered after handoff[3].

2. Mobility and QoS

2.1 The Impact of mobility on QoS

   Mobility of a host has a significant impact on the QoS parameters
   including packet delay, packet loss, jitter, and throughput.
   Specifically, when an MN moves from one location to another, the data
   flow path changes. As a result, the propagation delay of packets may
   change. The congestion delay at the routers along the new path may be
   different from that in the previous path. If the new location into
   which the MN moves, is overcrowded, the available bandwidth in the
   new location may not be sufficient to provide the throughput it was
   receiving at the previous location.

   In addition, the mobile user may suffer temporary disruption of
   service during handoff while the connection is torn down along the
   old path and established along the new path. Therefore, the mobile
   users may have to adapt to these changes as they move with their
   connections open. In some extreme cases, some connections to the
   mobile users may have to be dropped if the minimum QoS requirements
   of all users cannot be satisfied.

2.2 Relationship between mobility and QoS signaling

   To minimize the QoS re-establishment delays and reduce the packet
   loss ratio, QoS signaling schemes and mobility mechanisms need to be
   combined effectively. In this way, resource reservations along the
   new data path can be installed faster, reducing the disruption to the
   data flows. This also can improve scalability and reduce signaling
   overhead because only a small number ofupdate/signaling messages are
   required.  Furthermore, they can be localized to the affected areas
   of the network only.

2.3 Brief analysis of some existing solutions based on RSVP

   Like many of previously proposed solutions, our approach is also
   based on RSVP. In this section, we describe the key features and
   drawbacks of some existing solutions based on RSVP. This analysis is
   used in providing general QoS signaling procedures for fast QoS
   re-establishment in an IP-based RAN.

   Mobile RSVP (MRSVP)[4], an RSVP extension, was proposed to support.
   The major feature of MRSVP is passive reservation. This special RSVP
   session is pre-established to prepare for the possible movement of
   the mobile host to a new location. In passive reservation, each
   mobile host must maintain a mobility specification (MSPEC) that
   includes information on all locations which a mobile host may visit
   during the lifetime of a connection. MRSVP requires special hosts,



Lee, et al.            Expires December 22, 2003                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft            Mobile QoS Signaling                 June 2003


   called proxy agent, to make active/passive reservations along the
   paths from the locations in the MSPEC of a sender to the locations in
   the MSPEC of a receiver on behalf of the mobile host. The major
   drawback of this approach is that the intermediate routers along the
   reservation paths must manage all state information in the passive
   reservation. Furthermore, the architecture requires all routers to
   support passive reservation, and the mobile host is also required to
   have prior knowledge of its mobility.

   A method similar to MRSVP was proposed in [5], which employs a
   predictive reservation and temporary reservation scheme. With this
   mechanism, a mobile host makes predictive resource reservation in
   advance at the locations where it may visit during the lifetime of
   the connection. These locations become the leaves of a multicast tree
   and the mobility of a host is modeled as transitions in the multicast
   group membership. To make more efficient use of wireless resources,
   temporary reservations can temporarily use the inactive bandwidth
   reserved by the predictive reservations.

   An architecture for QoS in mobile networks using RSVP and CBQ [6] was
   proposed, which requires fewer passive reservation-capable routers
   compared to MRSVP. The major feature of this approach is to use RSVP
   path extension to guarantee QoS in the mobile Internet. With this
   mechanism, a reservation path may be extended continuously if the
   mobile host keeps moving within a QoS domain. Every gateway router
   also needs to be able to make passive reservations. In addition,
   there is no way to maintain and extend an existing RSVP session when
   the mobile host moves into a different administrative domain.

3. QoS Signaling Procedures for IP-based RANs

3.1 Overview

   In this section, we give an overview of the general QoS signaling
   procedures for IP-based RANs. Here we assume that the proposed QoS
   signaling mechanism is based on RSVP as in many of existing signaling
   solutions. For simplicity, with the proposed signaling procedures, it
   is assumed that the MN acts as a receiver.

   Mobility protocols such as Mobile IPv6 require home agents and
   foreign agents to aid in routing. Similarly, it is desirable to have
   Mobility Proxy Agents (MPAs) to manage resources along the paths from
   the sender to the locations which the MN may visit. The MPA is the
   key functional entity which is mobility-aware and responsible for
   handling QoS signaling messages in an IP-based RAN. The MPA's
   functionalities can be installed at any intermediate router, e.g., a
   crossover router (CR).

   The basic functionalities of the MPA include the following:

   - The MPA keeps track of the valid bindings between the Regional CoA
   (RCoA) and the local CoA (LCoA) of a MN. The IP address of the MN is
   always represented by its RCoA format, and the reservation is based
   on the RCoA [2]. The MPA performs dynamic address translation between 
   the RCoA and the LCoA of the MN as necessary. The MPA keeps RCoAs in
   its internal reservation state block for MNs.

   - All signaling messages to the MN in the subnet are delivered via
   the MPA to which the MN belongs.

   - The MPA initiates fast pre-reservation on behalf of the MN which is
   not currently present in the locations that the MN may visit. We
   assume that the MN knows the locations which it is likely to visit.

   - The MPA needs to communicate with the ARs which the MN may visit to
   obtain resource availability information (optional) and to send
   pre-reservation request messages to them in advance.

   - A resource reservation is set up from the sender  to the MN via the
   MPA. An important issue is how the MN determines who will be its MPA.
   To determine the IP address of the MPA, an MPA discovery mechanism
   can be used.

   After the MN finds the IP address of its MPA, the next task is to
   setup the path from the sender to its current location via the MPA
   using a path setup message (e.g., PATH) from the sender. Resource
   reservations will be set up along the determined path. On receiving

Internet-Draft            Mobile QoS Signaling                 June 2003


   the path setup message, the MN sends a resource reservation message
   (e.g., RESV) for the current reservation. The resource reservation
   message contains the detailed reservation specification.

   When the MPA receives a path setup message for an MN, it  forwards
   the path message to the MN. At the same time, the MPA communicates
   with neighboring ARs which the MN may visit and obtains resource
   availability information from them. The resource availability
   information may be forwarded to the MN.

   In summary, there are several procedures involved in the signaling.
   These include MPA discovery, initial end-to-end resource reservation
   setup, reservation confirmation, fast pre-reservation before the
   handoff is completed, soft state maintenance, fast release of
   previously reserved resources, and handling of error messages. In the
   following subsections, we describe each of these procedures in
   detail.

3.2 Mobile Proxy Agent (MPA) Discovery

   The MPA manages resources on behalf of an MN. As described above, the
   MPA is the key functional entity in an IP-based RAN because the
   resources are managed by the MPA and actual reservations are set up
   through the MPA. Thus, an MN needs to discover its MPA first.

   The MPA can be discovered using a multicast address. The MN sends an
   MPA discovery message, and then an MPA which receives the MPA
   discovery message responds with a confirmation or reject message.
   After the MPA sends a confirmation message with its IP address, the
   MPA and the MN can communicate with each other and exchange necessary
   information for resource reservations. After the IP address of the
   MPA is discovered, the next step is to set up a reservation path from
   the sender to the MPA and the MN.

3.3 Resource Reservation Setup

   To initiate the actual end-to-end reservation process, the sender has
   to be informed of the destination IP address of the application flow.
   If we assume that unicast routing scheme is used, the RCoA of the MN
   is used as the destination IP address of the application flow. In the
   unicast routing scheme for unicast flows, the MN will send its LCoA
   to its MPA, because MPA also needs to know the LCoA of the MN for
   forwarding all the messages destined for the MN.

   After the initial communication between the MPA and the MN is
   completed, signaling messages for actual resource reservation are
   generated. The following two subsections describe the detailed
   procedures for generating and processing signaling messages.

Internet-Draft            Mobile QoS Signaling                 June 2003


3.3.1 Generation of path setup messages

   Path setup messages are generated and processed in a way similar to
   RSVP. That is, they are periodically generated by the sender and
   intermediate routers along the path to the receiver.

   The MPA will start receiving the path setup message. The destination
   IP address in the path setup message should be the RCoA of the MN.

3.3.2 Generation of resource reservation messages

   On receiving a path setup message, the receiver (e.g., an MN) will
   generate a resource reservation message (e.g., RESV) and forward it
   to the previous hop upstream via the current AR and the MPA. This
   resource reservation message will setup reservation at the routers
   including the MPA as it travels upstream.

   When the MPA receives the resource reservation message, it will try
   to create reservation states for the reservation on the downstream
   interface. If it fails, it will send a reservation error message to
   the MN. Otherwise, it will send the resource reservation message for
   reservation upstream. The reservation error message may contain
   enough information so that the MN can decide its future direction.

3.4 Generation of Reservation Confirmation Messages

   As in RSVP, the MN can send a request for confirmation for its
   reservation request. In this case, the request for confirmation is
   included in the resource reservation messages.

3.5 Soft State Maintenance

   The soft state similar to RSVP is maintained to manage the
   reservation state at routers, MNs, and MPAs. On receiving the
   resource reservation message, a router sets up state for fast
   reservation. This state is deleted unless it is refreshed by a new
   resource reservation message before the refresh timer expires. In
   addition, for fast QoS re-establishment, pre-reservation state is
   maintained for a short period. Specifically, the MPA sends a
   pre-reservation request message to ARs that the MN may visit, and a
   pre-reservation state is temporarily maintained until the handoff is
   completed.

3.6 Fast QoS re-establishment after handoff

   The MPA is responsible for immediate QoS re-establishment after
   handoff and fast release of resources reserved along the old path.
   The MPA knows when the handoff begins by receiving a handoff



Lee, et al.            Expires December 22, 2003                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft            Mobile QoS Signaling                 June 2003


   initiation message from an MN through the current AR. The MPA then
   sends a pre-reservation message to all neighboring ARs which the MN
   may visit, to pre-reserve resources along the new path, in response
   to the handoff initiation message.

3.7 Fast Release of Resources

   As in RSVP, reservation states are explicitly torn down when a flow
   terminates or when the admission control rejects a reservation.

   In addition, it is needed to release the previously reserved
   resources along the old path immediately after handoff. To release
   the previously reserved resources along the old path after handoff,
   the MPA first needs to receive the binding update message from the MN
   which  arrived at a new AR. On receiving the message, the MPA
   immediately deletes reservation states of the old session and
   transmits a reservation release message toward the old AR at the same
   time.

3.8 Generation of Error Messages

   If any reservation fails, a reservation error message will be
   delivered to the MN. The reservation error message may contain enough
   information so that the MN can decide its future direction.

4. An Approach for QoS Signaling in IP-based RANs

   The goal of this protocol is to allow MN to obtain a DAD-free NCoA as
   soon as it establishes connectivity on a new link. This section
   describes our protocol in detail.Based on the general QoS signaling
   procedures described above, we propose a specific signaling scheme
   for immediate QoS re-establishment and fast release of previously
   reserved resources along the old path in an IP-based RAN. Like many
   other solutions, our approach is also based on RSVP.

4.1 Fast Resource Reservation and Release

   The proposed signaling scheme, called FREE (Fast resource REservation
   and rElease), pre-reserves resources along the new path and releases
   resources reserved along the old path before the handoff is
   completed. The following subsection describes the basic functional
   entities of FREE.

4.1.1 Basic Functional Entities

   (1) FREE Manager (FM)

   As described above, the MPA is the key functional entity for QoS
   signaling in an IP-based RAN. In our proposed scheme, FREE Manager
   (FM) plays the role of MPA. The FM is responsible for resource
   reservation and release in an IP-based RAN. The FM knows when the
   handoff begins by receiving a FREE_Initiation message from an MN via
   the its old AR. And then the FM sends a Path_Req message to all
   neighboring ARs which the MN may visit to pre-reserve resources
   during the specified timeout period.

   On receiving a binding update (BU) message, the FM transmits
   Reverse_Path_Teardown message (or Path_Teardown message) and Resv
   Teardown message (or Reverse_Resv_Teardown message) if MN is a
   receiver (or MN is a sender), and deletes path and reservation states
   of the old session.

   The FM can be located at any intermediate routers in an IP-based RAN.
   To optimize the proposed FREE mechanism, the FM can be installed at a
   CR which connects the old AR with a new AR.

   The FM also maintains the reservation session from MN to CN as
   described in Section 4.1.6. If both end terminals are mobile, the FM
   maintains the reservation session by dividing the state of the
   reservation session into three subsessions after establishing an
   end-to-end resource reservation session: MN-to-FM, FM-to-FM, and
   FM-to-CN. The FM-to-FM is the fixed subsession while the MN-to-FM and
   the FM-to-CN are the subsessions which change dynamically according



Lee, et al.            Expires December 22, 2003               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft            Mobile QoS Signaling                 June 2003


   to MN's handoffs.

   (2) FREE module of Access Router (FAR)

   An AR has a FREE-related entity, called FREE module of Access Router
   (FAR). The FAR forwards the FREE_Initiation message received from the
   MN to the FM. The FAR can also pre-reserve new resources from the FAR
   to the FM.

   If the MN is a receiver, the FAR of a new AR transmits a Resv message
   to the FM on receiving a Path_Req message from the FM to pre-serve
   new resources during a certain time interval. However, the FAR
   forwards the Path_Req message to the MN if it does not establish any
   new reservation path during the time interval.  And then the MN newly
   re-establishes the necessary resource reservation by only
   transmitting the Resv message to the FM through the new AR.

   If the MN is a sender, the FAR transfers the Path_Req message to the
   FM in response to the FREE_Initiation message from the FM. The FAR
   does not forward the Path_Req message to the MN although it does not
   establish any new reservation since the MN is a sender. In this case,
   the MN re-establishes a new resource reservation by sending the Path
   message to the FM (via the FAR).

4.1.2 Notification of Handoff Initiation

   The time when the handoff begins should be known to avoid the
   excessive resource reservation. The FM can efficiently pre-reserve
   the requested resources if it knows the time when the MN's handoff
   starts in advance. To notify the handoff initiation, the MN transmits
   a FREE_Initiation message to the FAR of the old AR. It is possible
   for the MN to determine the time when the handoff begins by comparing
   SNR strength with the threshold value in the hard handoff (e.g., IEEE
   802.11).

4.1.3 Message Types

   TIn order to support our proposed signaling scheme, the following
   messages need to be defined. The detailed formats of these FREE
   messages are described in Section 4.1.8

   (1) FREE_Initiation message

   FREE_Initiation message is used to inform the FM of the time when the
   handoff begins and request the fast pre-reservation before handoff is
   completed. An MN sends the FREE_Initiation message to the old AR when
   the handoff begins, and then the old AR forwards it to the FM which
   may be installed at a CR. On receiving the FREE_Initiation message,

   the FM sends Path_Req message to the neighboring ARs which the MN (as
   a recevier) may visit.

   (2) Path_Req message

   Path_Req message is used to request pre-reservation of resources on
   the new paths between new ARs and the FM during a certain time
   interval. If the MN is a receiver, for instance, the FM sends this
   message to neighboring ARs which the MN may visit afterreceiving
   FREE_Initiation message from the old AR. The FM's refresh timer is
   set to a value when the Path_Req message is transmitted. The refresh
   timer value in the Path_Req message for pre-reservation should be
   optimized such that pre-reserved resources can be released
   immediately after the MN's handoff except the resources on the
   location visited by the MN. For instance, the refresh timer value can
   be  the actual handoff delay of the MN, Which is approximately 3 to
   4(seconds if Mobile IPv6 is used as a mobility protocol. After the
   timeout, the FM retransmits the Path-Req message to neighboring ARs
   which the MN may visit unless it receives BU message. However, on
   receiving the BU or Resv message from the MN,  the value of refresh
   timer is reset to the previous RSVP refresh timer value (e.g., 30s).

   (3) Reverse_Path_Teardown message

   Reverse_Path_Teardown message is used to delete the old path state
   and travels upstream  when the MN is a sender. The FM transmits this
   message together with Resv Teardown message in response to the BU
   message in order to delete the old path state and transmits it to the
   old AR (in the reverse direction of Path Teardown message
   transmission).

   (4) Reverse_Resv_Teardown message

   Reverse_Path_Teardown message is used to delete the old path state
   and travels upstream  when the MN is a sender. The FM transmits this
   message together with Resv Teardown message in response to the BU
   message in order to delete the old path state and transmits it to the
   old AR (in the reverse direction of Path Teardown message
   transmission).

4.1.4 Fast Resource Reservation

   We basically assume that both sender and receiver may be mobile.
   However, we mainly focus on the event where an MN undergoes only
   handoffs between ARs.

4.1.4.1 Upstream Data Transfer

   The MN can also act as a receiver which receives real-time traffic.
   After the initial end-to-end RSVP session between the MN and the CN
   is established, the FM commences to dividethe RSVP session into two
   subsessions: MN-to-FM and FM-to-CN. The FM is responsible for
   establishing the RSVP session and eliminating the old reservation
   path in an IP-based RAN while maintaining the fixed FM-to-FM
   subsession of the core network.

    Figure 2. Pre-reservation and Fast release when MN is a receiver

   If the MN starts to move to a new AR as shown in Figure 2, the MN
   first determines the time when the handoff begins and transmits the
   FREE_Initiation message to the old AR. And then the old AR forwards
   the FREE_Initiation message to the FM in order to immediately inform
   the FM of the impending handoff event of the MN. The FM transmits the
   Path_Req message to neighboring ARs which the MN may visit to ask
   them to rapidly reserve the resources, and then the neighboring ARs
   pre-reserve resources by sending Resv message to the FM. As soon as
   the FM transmits the Path_Req message, the FM may set the refresh
   timer value to the optimized one  for pre-reservation, as described
   above

   After the MN moves to a new AR, seamless QoS can be provided using
   pre-reservation.  After handoff, the MN transmits a BU message to the
   FM via the new AR as shown in Figure 2. And then, the FM resets the
   refresh timer value to the previous RSVP refresh timer value after
   receiving the BU message. In this way the FM is able to keep the new
   RSVP (FREE) session adequately. Next, the FM accommodates the new
   MN-to-FM subsession and the fixed FM-to-CN (or FM-to-FM if the CN is
   mobile) subsession, and finally a complete  end-to-end is
   established. On receiving the BU message, the FM starts to delete the
   old path and reservation states, as described in Section 4.1.5.

   If the MN does not move to any new AR during the timeout interval
   (e.g., if it returns to the old AR), the pre-reserved resources among
   the neighboring ARs and the FM are released by the expiration of the
   refresh timer. At the same time, the FM tries again to pre-reserve
   the required resources by re-transmitting the Path_Req message to the
   neighboring ARs which the MN may visit. This process is repeated
   until the FM receives any BU message.

   Figure 3. Fast resource reservation and release when MN is a receiver

   If the ARs in the neighborhood of the old AR do not grab the required
   resources during the timeout interval after receiving the Path_Req
   message, they will just forward the Path_Req message to the arriving
   MN as shown in Figure 3. As soon as the MN moves to a new AR, it will
   receive the Path_Req message from the new AR. On receiving the
   message, the MN only sends the Resv message (and BU message) to the
   FM via the new AR and finally establishes a new RSVP session for the
   FM. Since the resource reservation isaccomplished by only
   transferring the Resv message after handoff, the re-establishment
   delay for resource reservation is reduced compared to the existing
   mechanisms. On receiving the BU message, the FM deletes the old path
   and reservation state, as described in Section 4.1.5. If the MN does
   not arrive at any new AR during the timeout interval, the Path_Req
   messages at the neighboring ARs are discarded if the refresh timer
   expires. Afterwards, the FM retries to pre-reserve the required
   resources by re-transmitting the Path_Req message with the same

   timeout value to the neighboring ARs.

4.1.4.2 Downstream Data Transfer

   If the MN acts as a sender and transfers downstream data as shown in
   Figure 4, the procedure for processing the FREE_Initiation message is
   the same as the case of  the upstream data transfer except that the
   information of the sender descriptor in the FREE_Initiation message
   is checked (see Section 4.1.8.4). The neighboring ARs use the sender
   descriptor of the FREE_Initiation message to initiate the Path_Req
   message in response to the FREE_Initiation message (from the FM). As
   soon as the FREE_Initiation message is received, the FM forwards this
   message to the neighboring ARs to inform of the MN's impending
   handoff event. And then, the neighboring ARs transfer the Path_Req
   message to the FM to pre-reserve the required resources after
   receiving the FREE_Initiation message (from the FM). Finally, the
   required resources are (pre-)reserved when the FM sends the Resv
   message to the neighboring ARs during the timeout interval.

   Figure 4. Pre-reservation and Fast release when MN is a sender

   After the MN moves to a new AR, seamless QoS can be provided using
   pre-reservation.  After handoff, the MN transmits a BU message to the
   FM via the new AR as shown in Figure 4.. As soon as the BU message
   arrives in, the FM resets the refresh timer to the existing RSVP
   refresh timer value. Next, the FM accommodates the new MN-to-FM
   session and the fixed FM-to-CN (or FM-to-FM if the CN is mobile)
   subsession, and manages the two subsessions like the downstream
   transfer described above.

    Figure 5. Resource reservation and release when MN is a receiver

   If the MN does not arrive at any new AR until the refresh timer
   expires, the pre-reserved resources among the neighboring ARs and the
   FM are released by expiration of the refresh timer. At the same time,
   the FAR of the ARs reattempts to pre-reserve the required resources
   by re-transmitting the Path_Req message to the FM. This process is
   repeated until the FM receive any BU message (via any new AR).

   The MN transmits the Path message to the FM through the new AR if the
   required resources can not be pre-reserved. The FM then responds to
   the Path message by transferring the Resv message. At the same time,
   the FM also initiates the process of releasingthe old reservation
   path as described in Section 4.1.5.2.

4.1.5 Fast Resource Release

   The MN transmits the Path message to the FM through the new AR if the
   required resources can not be pre-reserved. The FM then responds to
   the Path message by transferring the Resv message. At the same time,
   the FM also initiates the process of releasingthe old reservation
   path as described in Section 4.1.5.2.

4.1.5.1 Upstream Data Transfer

   First, if the MN starts to move to a new AR as shown in Figure 2 and
   3, the MN determines the starting point of handoff and begins to
   transmit the FREE_Initiation message to the old AR. And then, the old
   AR forwards the FREE_Initiation message to the FM to immediately
   request the release of unused RSVP path after handoff. Note that the
   transfer of the FREE_Initiation message is only to request the
   release of reserved resource, not to release. In this case, since
   origination of the FREE_Initiation message indicates the
   re-establishment of end-to-FM reservation session, not an end-to-end
   session, the FM can prepare the release messages, the
   Reverse_Path_Teardown and Resv Teardown messages, to remove the old
   path and reservation states before receiving the BU message

   After receiving the BU message, the FM then releases the unused
   resources by transmitting both Resv Teardown and
   Reverse_Path_Teardown messages to the old AR. Afterwards, other MNs
   can use the released resources.

4.1.5.2 Downstream Data Transfer

Internet-Draft            Mobile QoS Signaling                 June 2003


   In the downstream data transfer, the procedure for processing the
   FREE_Initiation message is the same as the case of the upstream data
   transfer. To release the old path and reservation states as shown in
   Figure 4 and 5, the FM transmits the Path Teardown message and
   Reverse_Resv_Teardown message to the old AR in response to the BU
   message if the FM pre-reserves the request resources.

   If the FM does not pre-reserve the resources, the procedure for
   resource release is initiated after the FM receives the Path message
   from the MN (via a new AR).

4.1.6 The Session of the FREE

   The session of the FREE is divided into subsessions according to the
   mobility characteristics of end terminals  If both end terminals are
   mobile, the FM commences to divide the RSVP session into three
   subsessions after the initial end-to-end RSVP session is established
   between the MN and the CN: MN-to-FM, FM-to-FM, and FM-to-CN. The FM
   is responsible for converting the LCoA into the RCoA to associate the
   MN-to-FM (or the FM-to-CN) session of an IP-based RAN with the fixed
   FM-to-FM session of the core network [2]. In this way, an end-to-end
   session is established with the conversion between RCoA and LCoA.

4.1.7 The location of FREE module

   The FM can be placed at any intermediate router (as an internal
   module) in an IP-based RAN. To optimize the proposed mechanism, it
   may be necessary that the FM is installed at a crossover router which
   connects the old AR and the new AR.

4.1.8 FREE Message Formats

   Here we define four additional messages to support the proposed
   mechanism. These messages basically conform to the existing RSVP
   message formats, except the Msg Tpye value of common header [1]. The
   added value of Msg Type can be set using the Reserved field of common
   header.


    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

4.1.8.1 Path_Req message

   Each router in IP-based RAN periodically sends a Path_Req message for
   each data flow it originates. A Path_Req message travels from an FM
   to AR(s) along the same path(s) used by the data packets, and vice
   versa. This message is used to pre-reserve resources on the new paths
   during the timeout interval, and the Msg Type value of common header
   is 8. Except the value of Msg Type, it conforms to the format of the
   Path message of the existing RSVP [1].

4.1.8.2 Reverse_Path_Teardown message

   On receiving a Reverse_Path_Teardown message, the path state of the
   old session is deleted. The old matching state must have a match of
   the SESSION, SENDER_TEMPLATE, and RSVP HOP objects. If there is no
   matching path state, a Reverse_Path_Teardown message should be
   discarded and not be forwarded.

   The messages are explicitly generated by the FM , and they travel
   upstream from the FM to the old AR. Therefore, its IP destination
   address must be the address of the old AR, and its IP source address
   must be the address of the FM from the path state being torn down.
   The Msg value of common header is 9, and it conforms to the format of
   the Path Teardown message of the existing RSVP except having the RSVP
   HOP object in the reverse direction of Path Teardown message
   transmission.

4.1.8.3 Reverse_Resv_Teardown message

   On receiving a Reverse_Resv_Teardown message matching reservation
   state of the old session is deleted. The old matching reservation
   state must have a match of the SESSION, STYLE, FILTER_SPEC, and PHOP
   objects. If there is no matching reservation state, a
   Reverse_Resv_Teardown message should be discarded.

   Reverse_Resv_Teardown messages are initiated explicitly by the FM,
   and they travel upstream from the FM to the old AR. Therefore, its IP
   destination address must be the address of the old AR, and its IP
   source address must be the address of the FM from the path state
   being torn down. The Msg value of common header is 10, and it
   conforms the format of the Resv Teardown message of the existing RSVP
   except having PHOP object in the reverse direction of Resv Teardown
   message transmission.

4.1.8.4 FREE_Initiation message

   A FREE_Initiation messages are sent to inform the starting point of
   the handoff. It contains a SENDER_TEMPLATE object which defines the

Internet-Draft            Mobile QoS Signaling                 June 2003


   format of the data packets and a SENDER_TSPEC object specifying the
   traffic characteristics of the flow. A FREE_Initiation message
   travels from an MN to the FM(s) along the old path(s) used by the
   data packets. If the MN as a sender performs downstream data
   transfer, the FREE_Initiation message is transferred to request the
   transmission of the Path_Req message to the neighboring ARs (from the
   FM). In this case, FAR duplicates the SENDER_TEMPLATE object and a
   SENDER_TSPEC object of the FREE_Initiation message to generate the
   Path_Req message.

   The format of a FREE_Initiation message is as follows:

   (FREE_Initiaion Message) ::= (Common Header) [ (INTEGRITY) ]
                            (SESSION) (MOBILITY_SPEC)
                            (TIME_VALUES)
                            [ (POLICY_DATA) ... ]
                            [ (sender descriptor) ]
   (sender descriptor) ::= (SENDER_TEMPLATE)(SENDER_TSPEC)[(ADSPEC)]

   The Msg value of common header is 11, and the Mobility_Spec contains 
   the information of ARs in the neighborhood of current AR that the MN 
   stays.

5. Security Considerations

   The resource pre-reservation triggered by a handoff initiation
   message MUST be guarded against security attacks. Such attacks could
   be made by malicious nodes that spoof the QoS signaling to make it
   appear to a mobility proxy agent that the MN has undergone handoff.
   Such an attack could disrupt the QoS offered to MN's ongoing sessions
   as the intermediate nodes may then tear down the QoS along some
   segments of the current true packet paths among MN, MPA, and CN.
   Furthermore, network resources may be wasted or used in an
   unauthorized manner by the malicious nodes that spoof MN's handoff.
   To prevent this, QoS mechanism MUST provide means for intermeidate
   nodes to verify the authenticity of handoff-induced resource
   pre-reservation.

6. Conclusion

   The IETF NSIS WG is currently designing general signaling protocols
   based on the signaling requirements and framework. It is desirable to
   provide necessary signaling procedures for resource reservations in
   an IP-based RAN. In this draft, we described general QoS signaling
   procedures in an IP-based RAN, which are based on the analysis of the
   existing QoS signaling solutions in mobile wireless networks. We also
   presented a specific QoS signaling scheme based on the proposed
   signaling procedures.
