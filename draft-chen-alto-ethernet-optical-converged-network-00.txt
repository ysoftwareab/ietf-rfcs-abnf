            ALTO in Ethernet and Optical Converged Networks
         draft-chen-alto-ethernet-optical-converged-network-00

Abstract

   In conventional enterprise data centers, there are at least two
   networks: Ethernet that allows users to access their applications on
   servers, optical networks which built on Fiber Channel, that enables
   those servers to access big data on storage network.  Because of
   their specialized hardware, they have vastly different management
   tools and require completely different skill sets to build and
   maintain.

   The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol is
   designed to provide network related information to client
   applications.  It has developed a lot in Ethernet, and now we
   consider to build a central control in a basic Ethernet and Optical
   converged networks.  Follow the concept of ALTO implementing in
   Ethernet networks, an ALTO server can get the necessary information
   from underlining Ethernet and Optical converged networks.  After
   abstracting the network information, ALTO server can achieve a
   central resource allocation and organize them into a standard format
   so as to provide useful information to ALTO clients.  This document
   designs a basic way of applying ALTO in converged networks.

1.  Introduction

   Reliability and Effectiveness are key metrics of the network
   qualities.  When facing multiple services, performance of networks
   varies a lot.  It seems that just one network would be more cost-
   efficient.  However, as a result of big data and cloud computing,
   optical networks play an important role in meeting high speed demand.
   Due to different mechanisms of packet and circuit networks' control,
   management and transport technology, a unified control of the two
   networks develops slowly.  One highly scalable, high-performance
   network with consistent management tools handling both Ethernet and
   storage traffic is a promise of converged networking.

   The initialize of converged networks was because 1Gbps Ethernet
   couldn't handle the loads that enterprises throw at their 4Gbps and
   8Gbps Fiber Channel-based storage networks.  After that, Ethernet

   capability has increased but Fiber Channel still wins in an assured
   delivery protocol.  Using high-level protocols in Ethernet to
   implement flow control and error correction is both complex and
   expensive from a latency perspective.

   ALTO is aimed at application layer optimization and it standardizes
   the interaction between ALTO server and ALTO clients.  How to extract
   information from underlining networks and abstract them properly are
   crucial.  In practical, loading network information by an Agent, as
   well as getting available information with OpenFlow protocol by
   building an ALTO server on a SDN controller are both viable ways.
   Here we point out a basic thread on how to achieve optical resource
   abstraction and allocation based on OpenFlow extension.  After that,
   we use necessary information to reflect basic standard information of
   ALTO server.  In this case, bandwidth achievement is the significant
   difference comparing with Ethernet, and other metrics like hop count,
   cost can follow the Ethernet conception.  Here we put optical
   transport network (OTN) devices as the optical network elements and
   discuss electrical switching, and the optical switching is out of
   scope of this document.

   This document is organized as follows.  Section 2 proposal an ALTO
   Architecture in Converged Networks.  Based on it, Section 3 forward a
   simple Ethernet and optical converged networks model.  In the Optical
   Networks Resource Abstraction module shown in Figure 1.  Section 4
   aims to illustrate it by explain optical resource abstraction and
   allocation.  In detail, Section 4.1 analyze the southbound interface
   design based on OTN physical features.  Section 4.2 illustrate a
   simple rule on allocate the optical bandwidth resource and
   configurations.  At last, Section 5 discuss the central aspect from
   ALTO server of Ethernet and optical converged networks and future
   thinking.

1.3.  Changes Since Version -00

   o  Change the format of API for clients' request.  This design is
      more concise and has better compatibility.  It does not modify the
      IRD of ECS.  Section 3.1 introduces a new abstraction for Endpoint
      which defines the ConnectionURI to represent an endpoint.  And a
      specific flow can be determined by a pair of ConnectionURI.

   o  Add some design principles in section 4.

   o  Give two strategies to solve the multi-path problem and handle
      fine-grained path error in section 6.  One option is to introduce
      feedback mechanism, the other option is to implement exploring.

2.  ALTO Architecture in Converged Networks

   As we introduce optical network resource into the underlining network
   environment.  Some modules should addict to the ALTO server
   reasonably.  Here is a ALTO Architecture in Ethernet and optical
   converged networks in Figure 1.  In this architecture, we describe
   the underlining converged networks and Optical Networks Resource
   Abstraction further more in Section 3 and Section 4.  Over the
   Ethernet Network Resource Extraction and Optical Networks Resource
   Abstraction modules, there is a Converged Network Resource
   Integration module which we may infer some aspects from it in the
   following.

3.  Ethernet and Optical Converged Networks Model

   The variety of services requires controllable and flexible mechanism
   of networks in a certain degree.  Dynamic scheduling service
   depending on specific situation can improve source utilization.  And
   reasonably intelligent network control does not only save costs of
   network operation and maintenance, but also cater to the needs of
   various services much more.

   We proposed a simple Ethernet and optical converged networks model
   which has considered the physical characteristics of optical
   transport networks.  The switching granularity is at time slot level,
   or optical fiber.  In the model.  Optical networks bear the large
   transmission tasks and locate in the core position.  At the edge of
   the network model, Ethernet plays an access role of the network
   environment and face the applications directly.  Consider the
   electrical switch character and separation design between control
   plane and data plane of optical networks, it seems to be less
   significant in applying ALTO to optical networks as the origin design
   can achieve the same effect as ALTO.  But ALTO in Ethernet and
   optical converged network is of value to provide a better service for
   ALTO clients due to the converged network resource integration.
   Imagine that, ALTO server obtain a global view both on Ethernet and
   optical networks, the schedule and false detection will be more
   direct.

4.  Optical Resource Abstraction and Allocation

   The feasible proposed architecture has to consider the
   programmability of network configuration based on physical device and
   application.  Switching in optical NE can be supported in both
   electrical and optical domains.  For time division multiplexing (TDM)
   circuits with guaranteed bandwidths, electrical switching is at
   tributary slot level.  Generally, TDM is defined by the OTN optical
   data unit (ODUk) standards with a rigid bandwidth hierarchy, and
   provides fixed and guaranteed bandwidth for client ports.  Networks
   can make an appropriate combination of electrical and optical
   switching based on the application requirements.

4.1.  Optical Resource Abstraction

   Figure 2 illustrates OTN device abstraction and information mapping.
   Software defined networking principles can be applied to many
   different optical transport network architectures.  So we leave a
   field to express feature type.  In this case, we set it as OTN Layer
   Stack, and then list OTN layer entries.  Each of layer entries'
   information refines layer class, signal type, adaptation.  Layer
   class and signal type, as the most important optical port

   information, will reflect some certain performance of optical
   networks.  ODU client (ODUCLT) Layer represents client-side
   information and it is always Ethernet signal type.  ODU Layer
   influences the length and allocation of tributary slot, it represents
   the switching granularity.  The signal type of optical transform unit
   (OTU) Layer indicates a certain bandwidth.  Optical Channel (OCh)
   Layer corresponds to the optical signal type.  Here we discuss
   electrical switching only.

4.2.  Optical Resource Allocation

   Configuring tables of network element (NE) is another challenge.
   Based on signal types of NE, ODUx is a good candidate to become a
   match principle.  Besides allocation tributary slot according to
   ODUx, we should also consider Ethernet signal types.  A simple
   simulation scene presents two kind of services implementation based
   on bandwidth demand.  Besides the specific technical realisation of
   optical NE table configuration.  We would like to show an example of
   the service based clients use case in converged networks.

   Tributary slot allocation plays an important role in electrical
   switching.  As a direct influence factor of granularity, ODUx leads
   ways for matching flow entries namely resource allocation.  In
   Figure 3, suppose electrical switching granularity of an optical NE
   is ODU0 which represents 1.25GE bandwidth.  ODU0 presents a match
   principle of match field, i.e., ODU_SIGTYPE.  And ODU_SIGID manages
   output ways as an action principle.  Similarly, OTU Layer signal type
   OTU2 indicates a given bandwidth 10GE.  Conclusively, bandwidth
   reflexed by OTUx and ODUx indicates numbers of tributary slot (TSLEN)
   gotten by OTUx's dividing by ODUx's, so we get a value of TSLEN: 8 to
   provide services in this case.  In figure 3, suppose an client A
   requires 1GE bandwidth accesses Port 1 of Optical NE:1 (NE:1:1) .
   From above we can deduce that one tributary slot is occupied by the
   service namely tributary port number (TPN) equals 1.  It should be
   noticed that tributary slot map (TSMAP) is presented by binary array.
   So the value of it is a result of transform from binary value to
   decimal value.  In this situation, suppose client A is routed from
   NE:1:4 to NE:2:2.  Apparently, the action principle of service in
   NE:1 turns to be match principle of NE:2 to a large extent.  A small
   difference may be presented in TSMAP allocation.  Referred to the
   action principle of NE:2, the output field is NE:2:4.

5.  ALTO Standardized Converged Networks Information Construction

   For OTN device, we know that the numbers of unused tributary slot can
   deduce to the remaining bandwidth resource.  From the aspect of ALTO
   Clients, there is no need for them to know the underlining networks
   but just the remaining network resource and other parameters on
   transport.  As we mentioned at the beginning, we can extract the
   optical networks information by extending OpenFlow protocol and
   abstract the information into useful resource.  We can get the
   tributary slot information by changing a little bit on the port reply
   message of OpenFlow.  This document put forward a possibility on
   integrating the Ethernet and optical converged networks by deploying
   an ALTO server.  In the future, we will combine optical network
   resource with ALTO in protocol level.
