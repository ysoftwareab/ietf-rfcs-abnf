           Distributing Address Selection Policy using DHCPv6
                 draft-ietf-6man-addr-select-opt-01.txt

Abstract

   RFC 3484 defines default address selection mechanisms for IPv6 that
   allow nodes to select appropriate address when faced with multiple
   source and/or destination addresses to choose between.  The RFC
   allowed for the future definition of methods to administratively
   configure the address selection policy information.  This document
   defines a new DHCPv6 option for such configuration, allowing a site
   administrator to distribute address selection policy, and thus
   control the address selection behavior of nodes in their site.  While
   RFC 3484 is in the process of being updated, with a revised default
   policy table, that table may not suit every scenario, and thus the
   DHCPv6 option defined in this text may be used to override that
   policy where desired.

1.  Introduction

   RFC 3484 [RFC3484] describes default algorithms for selecting an
   address when a node has multiple destination and/or source addresses
   to choose between by using an address selection policy.  In Section 2
   of RFC 3484, it is suggested that the default policy table may be
   administratively configured to suit the specific needs of a site.
   This text defines a new DHCPv6 option for such configuration.

   Some problems have been identified with the default address selection
   policy detailed in RFC 3484 [RFC5220], and as a result the RFC is in
   the process of being updated, as per [I-D.ietf-6man-rfc3484-revise].
   While this update provides a better default address selection policy,
   it is unlikely that such a default will suit all scenarios, and thus
   mechanisms to control the source address selection policy will be
   necessary.  Requirements for those mechanisms are described in
   [RFC5221], while solutions are discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-6man-addr-select-sol] and
   [I-D.ietf-6man-addr-select-considerations].  Those documents have
   helped shape the improvements in [I-D.ietf-6man-rfc3484-revise] as
   well as the DHCPv6 option defined here.

2.  Address Selection Policy Option

   The Address Selection Policy Option provides the policy table for
   address selection rules as described in RFC 3484 and updated in
   [I-D.ietf-6man-rfc3484-revise].

   Each end node is expected to configure its policy table, as described
   in RFC 3484, using the Address Selection Policy option information as
   described in the section below on processing the option.

   The format of the Address Selection Policy option is given below:

   option-code:  OPTION_DASP (TBD)

   option-len:  The total length of the label fields, precedence fields,
        zone-index fields, prefix-len fields, and prefix fields in
        octets.

   label:  An 8-bit unsigned integer; this value is used to make a
        combination of source address prefixes and destination address
        prefixes.

   precedence:  An 8-bit unsigned integer; this value is used for
        sorting destination addresses.

   z bit:  'zone-index' bit.  If z bit is set to 1, 32 bit zone-index
        value is included right after the "prefix-len" field, and
        "Prefix" value continues after the "zone-index" field.  If z bit
        is 0, "Prefix" value continues right after the "prefix-len"
        value.

   reserved:  6-bit reserved field.  Initialized to zero by sender, and
        ignored by receiver.

   zone-index:  If the z-bit is set to 1, this field is inserted between
        "prefix-len" field and "Prefix" field.  The zone-index field is
        an 32-bit unsigned integer and used to specify zones for scoped
        addresses.  This bit length is defined in RFC3493 [RFC3493] as
        'scope ID'.

   prefix-len:  An 8-bit unsigned integer; the number of leading bits in
        the prefix that are valid.  The value ranges from 0 to 128.  The
        Prefix field is 0, 4, 8, 12, or 16 octets, depending on the
        length.

   Prefix:  A variable-length field containing an IP address or the
        prefix of an IP address.  An IPv4-mapped address [RFC4291] must
        be used to represent an IPv4 address as a prefix value.



3.  Appearance of this Option

   The Address Selection Policy option MUST NOT appear in any messages
   other than the following ones: Solicit, Advertise, Request, Renew,
   Rebind, Information-Request, and Reply.

4.  Processing the Address Selection Policy Option

   This section describes how to process received Address Selection
   Policy Options at the DHCPv6 client.

   This option's concept is to serve as a hint for a node about how to
   behave in the network.  So, basically, it should be up to the node's
   administrator how to make use of or even ignore the received policy
   information.

   However, we need to define the default behavior of the receiving node
   in order to reduce operational complexity.

4.1.  Handling the local policy table

   RFC3484 defines the default policy for the policy table.  Also, a
   user is usually able to configure the policy table to satisfy his
   requirement.

   The client node SHOULD provide the following choices:

   a) It receives distributed policy table, and replaces the existing
      policy tables with that.
   b) It preserves the default policy table, or manually configured
      policy.

4.2.  Processing multiple received policy tables

   The policy table is node-global information by its nature.  So, the
   node cannot use multiple received policy tables at the same time.

   It should be noted that adopting a received policy table as the node-
   global information can cause security problems, such as DOS attack,
   and leak of privacy information.

   Moreover, it also should be noted that, when a node is single-homed
   and has only one upstream line, adopting a received policy table does
   not degrade the security level.

   Under the above assumptions, we specify how to handle multiple
   received policy tables below.

   A node MAY use OPTION_DASP in any of the following two cases:

Internet-Draft     DHCPv6 Address Selection Policy Opt         June 2011


   1: The address selection option is delivered across a secure, trusted
      channel.
   2: The address selection option is not secured, but the node is
      single-homed.

   In other cases the node MUST NOT use OPTION_DASP unless the node is
   specifically configured to do so.


5.  Implementation Considerations

   o  The value 'label' is passed as an unsigned integer, but there is
      no special meaning for the value, that is whether it is a large or
      small number.  It is used to select a preferred source address
      prefix corresponding to a destination address prefix by matching
      the same label value within the DHCP message.  DHCPv6 clients need
      to convert this label to a representation specified by each
      implementation (e.g., string).

   o  Currently, the label and precedence values are defined as 8-bit
      unsigned integers.  In almost all cases, this value will be
      enough.

   o  The maximum number of address selection rules that may be conveyed
      in one DHCPv6 message depends on the prefix length of each rule
      and the maximum DHCPv6 message size defined in RFC 3315.  It is
      possible to carry over 3,000 rules in one DHCPv6 message (maximum
      UDP message size), but the usual number would be much smaller,
      e.g. the default policy table defined in RFC 3484 contains 5
      rules.

   o  Since the number of selection rules could be large, an
      administrator configuring the policy to be distributed should
      consider the resulting DHCPv6 message size.



6.  Security Considerations

   A rogue DHCPv6 server could issue bogus address selection policies to
   a client.  This might lead to incorrect address selection by the
   client, and the affected packets might be blocked at an outgoing ISP
   because of ingress filtering.  Alternatively, an IPv6 transition
   mechanism might be preferred over native IPv6, even if it is
   available.

   To guard against such attacks, both DCHP clients and servers SHOULD
   use DHCP authentication, as described in section 21 of RFC 3315,

Internet-Draft     DHCPv6 Address Selection Policy Opt         June 2011


   "Authentication of DHCP messages."


7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign option codes to OPTION_DASP from the
   option-code space as defined in section "DHCPv6 Options" of RFC 3315.

Appendix A.  Past Discussion

   o  The 'zone index' value is used to specify a particular zone for
      scoped addresses.  This can be used effectively to control address
      selection in the site scope (e.g., to tell a node to use a
      specified source address corresponding to a site-scoped multicast
      address).  However, in some cases such as a link-local scope
      address, the value specifying one zone is only meaningful locally
      within that node.  There might be some cases where the
      administrator knows which clients are on the network and wants
      specific interfaces to be used though.  However, in general case,
      it is hard to use this value.

   o  Since we got a comment that some implementations use 32-bit
      integers for zone index value, we extended the bit length of the
      'zone index' field.  However, as described above, there might be
      few cases to specify 'zone index' in policy distribution, we
      defined this field as optional, controlled by a flag.

   o  There may be some demands to control the use of special address
      types such as the temporary addresses described in RFC4941
      [RFC4941], address assigned by DHCPv6 and so on. (e.g., informing
      not to use a temporary address when it communicate within the an
      organization's network).  It is possible to indicate the type of
      addresses using reserved field value.
