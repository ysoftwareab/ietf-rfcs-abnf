i    = number (i.e. position) of an octet within the TPDU
               (see 13.2);
L    = length of TPDU in octets.

T1 = ELR + ERL + AR + X

ELR = Expected maximum transit delay local-to-remote,
ERL = Expected maximum transit delay remote-to-local,
AR  = Remote acknowledge time, and
X   = local processing time for a TPDU.




L = MLR + MRL + R + AR

MLR = NSDU lifetime local-to-remote,
MRL = NSDU lifetime remote-to-local,
R   = Persistence time, and
AR  = Remote acknowledgement time.

W = (T1 * N)/(N-1) when the procedures are not used.




LWE  = lower window edge
UWE  = upper window edge
KUWE = lower bound on upper window edge
                 held by remote transport entity

X = -C1 + (L-n).CO
Y =  C1 - (L-n+1).C0
