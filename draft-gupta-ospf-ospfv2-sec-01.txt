1.   Introduction 
    
   OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) Version 2 [N1] defines the fields 
   AuType and Authentication in its protocol header to provide security.  
   These fields do not provide any confidentiality and also the

   authentication provided by these fields is weak [specific problems 
   here]. 
    
   The demands for securing the routing protocols have increased since 
   the OSPFv2 protocol was designed.  This document describes how IP 
   Security (Encapsulating Security Payload and Authentication Header 
   protocols) can be used to provide integrity, authentication, and/or 
   confidentiality to OSPFv2. 
    
   It is assumed that the reader is familiar with OSPFv2 [N1], 
   Authentication Header (AH) [N5], Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) 
   [N4], the concept of security associations, tunnel and transport mode 
   of IPsec, and the key management options available for AH and ESP 
   (manual keying [N3] and Internet Key Exchange (IKE)[I1]). 
 
 
2.   Transport Mode vs Tunnel Mode 
 
   The transport mode Security Association (SA) is generally used 
   between two hosts or routers/gateways when they are acting as hosts.  
   The SA must be a tunnel mode SA if either end of the security 
   association is a router/gateway.  Two hosts MAY establish a tunnel 
   mode SA between themselves.  OSPFv2 packets are exchanged between 
   routers.  However, since the packets are locally delivered, the 
   routers assume the role of hosts in the context of tunnel mode SA.   
   All implementations confirming to this specification MUST support 
   transport mode SA to provide required IPsec security to OSPFv2 
   packets.  They MAY also support tunnel mode SA to provide required 
   IPsec security to OSPFv2 packets. 
    
    
3.   Authentication 
    
   Implementations conforming to this specification MUST support 
   authentication for OSPFv2. 
    
   In order to provide authentication to OSPFv2, implementations MUST 
   support ESP and MAY support AH. 
    
   If ESP in transport mode is used, it will only provide authentication 
   to OSPFv2 protocol packets excluding the IP header and IP options. 
    
   If AH in transport mode is used, it will provide authentication to 
   OSPFv2 protocol packet, selected portions of IP header and selected 
   IP options. 
    
   When OSPFv2 authentication is enabled, 
    
      o OSPFv2 packets that are not protected with AH or ESP MUST be

        silently discarded. 
    
      o OSPFv2 packets that fail the authentication checks MUST be  
        silently discarded. 
    
    
4.   Confidentiality 
    
   Implementations conforming to this specification SHOULD support 
   confidentiality for OSPFv2. 
    
   If confidentiality is provided, ESP MUST be used. 
    
   When OSPFv2 confidentiality is enabled, 
    
      o OSPFv2 packets that are not protected with ESP MUST be silently 
        discarded. 
    
      o OSPFv2 packets that fail the confidentiality checks MUST be 
        silently discarded. 
    
    
5.   Distinguishing OSPFv2 from OSPFv3 [N2] 
    
   The IP/IPv6 Protocol Type for OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 is the same (89) and 
   OSPF distinguishes them based on the OSPF header version number.  
   However, current IPsec standards do not allow using arbitrary 
   protocol-specific header fields as the selectors.  Therefore, the 
   OSPF version field in the OSPF header cannot be used in order to 
   distinguish OSPFv2 packets from OSPFv3 packets.  As OSPFv2 is only 
   for IPv4 and OSPFv3 is only for IPv6, the version field in the IP 
   header can be used to distinguish OSPFv2 packets from OSPFv3 packets. 
 
 
6.   IPsec Requirements 
    
   In order to implement this specification, the following IPsec 
   capabilities are required. 
    
   Transport mode 
      IPsec in transport mode MUST be supported. [N3] 
       
   Multiple Security Policy Databases (SPDs) 
      The implementation MUST support multiple SPDs with a specific SPD 
      selection function. [N3] 
       
   Selectors 
      The implementation MUST be able to use source address, destination 
      address, protocol, and direction as selectors in the SPD.

Internet Draft Authentication/Confidentiality for OSPFv2      Aug 2009 
 
 
    
   Interface ID tagging 
      The implementation MUST be able to tag the inbound packets with 
      the ID of the interface (physical or virtual) via which it 
      arrived. [N3] 
    
   Manual key support 
      Manually configured keys MUST be able to secure the specified 
      traffic. [N3] 
    
   Encryption and authentication algorithms 
 
      The implementation MUST NOT allow the user to choose stream 
      ciphers as the encryption algorithm for securing OSPFv2 packets 
      since the stream ciphers are not suitable for manual keys. 
    
      Except when in conflict with the above statement, the key words 
      "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", and "SHOULD NOT" that 
      appear in the [N6] document for algorithms to be supported are to 
      be interpreted as described in [N7] for OSPFv2 support as well. 
       
   Dynamic IPsec rule configuration 
      The routing module SHOULD be able to configure, modify and delete 
      IPsec rules on the fly.  This is needed mainly for securing 
      virtual links. 
       
   Encapsulation of ESP packet 
      IP encapsulation of ESP packets MUST be supported.  For 
      simplicity, UDP encapsulation of ESP packets SHOULD NOT be used. 
       
   Different SAs for different Differentiated Services Code Points 
   (DSCPs) 
      As per [N3], the IPsec implementation MUST support the 
      establishment and maintenance of multiple SAs with the same 
      selectors between a given sender and receiver.  This allows the 
      implementation to associate different classes of traffic with the 
      same selector values in support of Quality of Service (QoS).  
    
    
7.   Key Management 
    
   OSPFv2 exchanges both multicast and unicast packets.  While running 
   OSPFv2 over a broadcast interface, the authentication/confidentiality 
   required is "one to many".  Since IKE is based on the Diffie-Hellman 
   key agreement protocol and works only for two communicating parties, 
   it is not possible to use IKE for providing the required "one to 
   many" authentication/confidentiality.  This specification mandates 
   the usage of Manual Keying with current IPsec implementations.  
   Future specifications can explore the usage of protocols like

   Kerberized Internet Negotiation of Keys/Group Secure Association Key 
   Management Protocol (KINK/GSAKMP) when they are widely available.  In 
   manual keying, SAs are statically installed on the routers and these 
   static SAs are used to authenticate/encrypt packets. 
    
   The following discussion explains that it is not scalable and is 
   practically infeasible to use different security associations for 
   inbound and outbound traffic to provide the required "one to many" 
   security.  Therefore, the implementations MUST use manually 
   configured keys with the same SA parameters (Security Parameter Index 
   (SPI), keys etc.,) for both inbound and outbound SAs (as shown in 
   Figure 3). 
    
    
    
    
    
    
       A                  | 
     SAa     ------------>| 
     SAb     <------------| 
                          | 
       B                  | 
     SAb     ------------>| 
     SAa     <------------|                 Figure: 1

   If we consider communication between A and B in Figure 1, everything 
   seems to be fine.  A uses security association SAa for outbound 
   packets and B uses the same for inbound packets and vice versa.  Now 
   if we include C in the group and C sends a packet using SAa, then 
   only A will be able to understand it.  Similarly, if C sends a packet 
   using SAb, then only B will be able to understand it.  Since the 
   packets are multicast and they are going to be processed by both A 
   and B, there is no SA for C to use so that both A and B can 
   understand them.

     SAa     <------------|                 Figure: 2 
     SAc     <------------|

                      Broadcast  
                       Network 
    
    
   The problem can be solved by configuring SAs for all the nodes on 
   every other node as shown in Figure 2.  So A, B, and C will use SAa, 
   SAb, and Sac, respectively, for outbound traffic.  Each node will 
   lookup the SA to be used based on the source (A will use SAb and SAc 
   for packets received from B and C, respectively).  This solution is 
   not scalable and practically infeasible because a large number of SAs 
   will need to be configured on each node.  Also, the addition of a 
   node in the broadcast network will require the addition of another SA 
   on every other node. 
    
    
      A                   | 
     SAo     ------------>| 
     SAi     <------------| 
                          | 
      B                   | 
     SAo     ------------>| 
     SAi     <------------|                 Figure: 3 
                          | 
      C                   | 
     SAo     ------------>| 
     SAi     <------------| 
                          | 
                      Broadcast  
                       Network 
    
   The problem can be solved by using the same SA parameters (SPI, Keys, 
   etc.) for both inbound (SAi) and outbound (SAo) SAs as shown in 
   Figure 3. 
    
    
8.   SA Granularity and Selectors 
    
   The user SHOULD be given the choice of sharing the same SA among 
   multiple interfaces or using a unique SA per interface.

9.   Virtual Links 
    
   A different SA than the SA of the underlying interface MUST be 
   provided for virtual links.  The source IP address of the OSPF 
   packets sent over the virtual links does not belong to the same 
   subnet as the interface running OSPFv2.  The source IP address of all 
   the other OSPF packets, however, lies in the same subnet.  This 
   difference in the IP source address differentiates the packets sent 
   on virtual links from other OSPFv2 interface types. 
    
   As the virtual link end point IP addresses are not known, it is not 
   possible to install SPD/Security Association Database (SAD) entries 
   at the time of configuration.  The virtual link end point IP 
   addresses are learned during the routing table computation process.  
   The packet exchange over the virtual links starts only after the 
   discovery of the end point IP addresses.  In order to protect these 
   exchanges, the routing module must install the corresponding SPD/SAD 
   entries before starting these exchanges.  Note that manual SA 
   parameters are preconfigured but not installed in the SAD until the 
   end point addresses are learned. 
    
10.     Rekeying 
 
   To maintain the security of a link, the authentication and encryption 
   key values SHOULD be changed from periodically. 
    
10.1     . Rekeying Procedure 
    
   The following three-step procedure SHOULD be provided to rekey the 
   routers on a link without dropping OSPFv2 protocol packets or 
   disrupting the adjacency. 
    
   (1) For every router on the link, create an additional inbound SA for 
       the interface being rekeyed using a new SPI and the new key. 
    
   (2) For every router on the link, replace the original outbound SA 
       with one using the new SPI and key values.  The SA replacement  
       operation should be atomic with respect to sending OSPFv2 packets 
       on the link so that no OSPFv2 packets are sent without 
       authentication/encryption. 
    
   (3) For every router on the link, remove the original inbound SA. 
    
   Note that all routers on the link must complete step 1 before any 
   begin step 2.  Likewise, all the routers on the link must complete 
   step 2 before any begin step 3.

   One way to control the progression from one step to the next is for 
   each router to have a configurable time constant KeyRolloverInterval.  
   After the router begins step 1 on a given link, it waits for this 
   interval and then moves to step 2.  Likewise, after moving to step 2, 
   it waits for this interval and then moves to step 3. 
    
   In order to achieve smooth key transition, all routers on a link 
   should use the same value for KeyRolloverInterval and should initiate 
   the key rollover process within this time period. 
    
   At the end of this procedure, all the routers on the link will have a 
   single inbound and outbound SA for OSPFv2 with the new SPI and key 
   values. 
    
10.2     . KeyRolloverInterval 
    
   The configured value of KeyRolloverInterval should be long enough to 
   allow the administrator to change keys on all the OSPFv2 routers.  As 
   this value can vary significantly depending upon the implementation 
   and the deployment, it is left to the administrator to choose the 
   appropriate value. 
    
10.3     . Rekeying Interval 
    
   This section analyzes the security provided by manual keying and 
   recommends that the encryption and authentication keys SHOULD be 
   changed at least every 90 days. 
    
   The weakest security provided by the security mechanisms discussed in 
   this specification is when NULL encryption (for ESP) or no encryption 
   (for AH) is used with the HMAC-MD5 authentication.  Any other 
   algorithm combinations will at least be as hard to break as the ones 
   mentioned above.  This is shown by the following reasonable 
   assumptions: 
    
   o NULL Encryption and HMAC-SHA-1 Authentication will be more secure 
   as HMAC-SHA-1 is considered to be more secure than HMAC-MD5. 
    
   o NON-NULL Encryption and NULL Authentication combination is not 
   applicable as this specification mandates authentication when OSPFv2 
   security is enabled. 
    
   o Data Encryption Security (DES) Encryption and HMAC-MD5 
   Authentication will be more secure because of the additional security 
   provided by DES. 
    
   o Other encryption algorithms like 3DES and the Advanced Encryption 
   Standard (AES) will be more secure than DES.

   RFC 3562 [I4] analyzes the rekeying requirements for the TCP MD5 
   signature option.  The analysis provided in RFC 3562 is also 
   applicable to this specification as the analysis is independent of 
   data patterns. 
 
11.     IPsec rules 
    
   The following set of transport mode rules can be installed in the SPD 
   to provide the authentication/confidentiality to OSPFv2 packets. 
    
   Outbound Rules for interfaces running OSPFv2 security: 
    
   No.  source       destination      protocol               action 
   1   intfPrefix       any             OSPF                 apply 
    
   Outbound Rules for virtual links running OSPFv2 security: 
    
   No.  source       destination      protocol               action 
   2    src/32         dst/32           OSPF                 apply 
    
   Inbound Rules for interfaces running OSPFv2 security: 
    
   No.  source       destination      protocol                action 
   3   intfPrefix       any       ESP/OSPF or AH/OSPF         apply 
   4   intfPrefix       any             OSPF                  drop 
    
   Inbound Rules for virtual links running OSPFv2 security: 
    
   No.  source       destination      protocol                action 
   5    src/32        dst/32      ESP/OSPF or AH/OSPF         apply 
   6    src/32        dst/32            OSPF                  drop 
    
    
   "intfPrefix" means the prefix of the interface that OSPFv2 is running 
   on.  For example, if the IP address of the interface where OSPFv2 is 
   configured is 192.0.2.1/24, the value of "intfPrefix" would be 
   "192.0.2.0/24". 
    
   For outbound rules, action "apply" means encrypting/calculating ICV 
   and adding an ESP or AH header.  For inbound rules, action "apply" 
   means decrypting/authenticating the packets and stripping the ESP or 
   AH header. 
    
   Rules 4 and 6 are to drop the insecure OSPFv2 packets without ESP/AH 
   headers. 
    
   ESP/OSPF or AH/OSPF in rules 3 and 5 mean that it is an OSPF packet 
   secured with ESP or AH.

   Rules 1, 3 and 4 are meant to secure the unicast and multicast OSPF 
   packets that are not being exchanged over the virtual links.  These 
   rules MUST only be installed in the security policy database (SPD) of 
   the interface running OSPFv2 security. 
    
   Rules 2, 5 and 6 are meant to secure the packets being exchanged over 
   virtual links.  These rules are installed after learning the virtual 
   link end point IPv6 addresses.  These rules MUST be installed on at 
   least the interfaces that are connected to the transit area for the 
   virtual link.  These rules MAY alternatively be installed on all the 
   interfaces.  If these rules are not installed on all the interfaces, 
   clear text or malicious OSPFv2 packets with the same source and 
   destination addresses as the virtual link end point IPv6 addresses 
   will be delivered to OSPFv2.  Though OSPFv2 drops these packets 
   because they were not received on the right interface, OSPFv2 
   receives some clear text or malicious packets even when the security 
   is enabled.  Installing these rules on all the interfaces insures 
   that OSPFv2 does not receive these clear text or malicious packets 
   when security is turned enabled.  On the other hand, installing these 
   rules on all the interfaces increases the processing overhead on the 
   interfaces where there is no other IPsec processing.  The decision of 
   installing these rules on all the interfaces or on just the 
   interfaces that are connected to the transit area is a private 
   decision and doesn't affect the interoperability in any way.  Hence 
   it is an implementation choice. 
 
 
12.     Entropy of Manual Keys 
   The implementations MUST allow the administrator to configure the 
   cryptographic and authentication keys in hexadecimal format rather 
   than restricting it to a subset of ASCII characters (letters, numbers 
   etc.).  A restricted character set will reduce key entropy 
   significantly as discussed in [I2]. 
 
13.     Replay Protection 
 
   Since it is not possible using the current standards to provide 
   complete replay protection while using manual keying, the proposed 
   solution will not provide protection against replay attacks. 
    
   Detailed analysis of various vulnerabilities of the routing protocols 
   and OSPF in particular is discussed in [I3] and [I2]. The conclusion 
   is that replay of OSPF packets can cause adjacencies to be disrupted, 
   which can lead to a DoS attack on the network. It can also cause 
   database exchange process to occur continuously thus causing CPU 
   overload as well as micro loops in the network.

Internet Draft Authentication/Confidentiality for OSPFv2      Aug 2009 
 
 
   This memo discusses the use of IPsec AH and ESP headers in order to 
   provide security to OSPFv2 for IPv6.  Hence, security permeates 
   throughout this document. 
    
   OSPF Security Vulnerabilities Analysis [I2] identifies OSPF 
   vulnerabilities in two scenarios -- one with no authentication or 
   simple password authentication and the other with cryptographic 
   authentication.  The solution described in this specification 
   provides protection against all the vulnerabilities identified for 
   scenarios with cryptographic authentication with the following 
   exceptions: 
    
   Limitations of manual key: 
    
   This specification mandates the usage of manual keys.  The following 
   are the known limitations of the usage of manual keys. 
    
     o As the sequence numbers cannot be negotiated, replay protection  
       can not be provided.  This leaves OSPF insecure against all the 
       attacks that can be performed by replaying OSPF packets. 
    
     o Manual keys are usually long lived (changing them often is 
       a tedious task).  This gives an attacker enough time to discover 
       the keys. 
    
     o As the administrator is manually configuring the keys, there is 
       a chance that the configured keys are weak (there are known weak 
       keys for DES/3DES at least). 
    
   Impersonating attacks: 
    
   The usage of the same key on all the OSPF routers connected to a link 
   leaves them all insecure against impersonating attacks if any one of 
   the OSPF routers is compromised, malfunctioning or misconfigured. 
    
   Detailed analysis of various vulnerabilities of routing protocols is 
   discussed in [I3].
