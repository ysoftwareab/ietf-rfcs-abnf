   Network Portability Requirements and Models for Cloud Environment
          draft-shima-cloud-net-portability-reqs-and-models-00

Abstract

   Recent progress of virtual machine technology made it possible to
   host various Internet service nodes in a so called cloud environment.
   The virtual machine hosting technology provides a method to migrate a
   virtual machine from one hypervisor to another.  However, such a
   technology is mainly focusing on a migration between hypervisors
   attached to the same link, and tend not to consider migration over
   the Internet.  This document mentions the purpose of that type of
   operation and describe several possible operation methods to provide
   network portability in cloud systems.

1.  Introduction

   The document describes requirements and methodology of network
   migration for inter-datacenter and inter-clouds.  The progress of
   virtualization technology makes changes for services on the Internet
   to work on the infrastructure of virtual nodes, called PaaS (Platform
   as a Services.)

   A PaaS is built and provided in single datacenter by single
   organization nowadays, however, the needs of building distributed,
   inter-datacenters PaaS and inter-connecting existing PaaS(es) are
   growing.  Because inter-datacenters PaaS is required for
   administrative points.  If a datacenter is encountered network
   circuit or power troubles, administrators or users of PaaS want to
   move the virtual nodes in a datacenter to other datacenters or other
   PaaS(es) without service interruption.

   In order to migrate virtual nodes between inter-datacenters and
   inter-clouds without service interruptions and changes, network
   portability technologies are required between the datacenters and
   clouds.


2.  Network Portability Requirements

   The requirements of network portability for migrating vitrual nodes
   between datacenters and clouds are below.

   o  providing user service networks between each datacenter and cloud

      Each user has different service networks and it should be possible
      for users to use their networks on any datacenters and clouds.  It
      is provided using VLAN and VPN technologies, however, building
      user networks using such technologies is difficult in inter-
      datacenters or inter-clouds environments.  VLAN is layer-2
      technology and it requires direct circuit between datacenters, so
      it is difficult from costly point of view.  VPN is cost-effective
      technology and it makes possible to provide user networks on each
      datacenters and clouds.  However, if the clouds are administrated
      by different organizations, it is difficult and costly for
      administrators to build a lot of VPN connection for all user
      networks.

   o  High-Availability of user networks

      Even if using VLAN and VPN technologies, each user network has a
      single connecting point to the Internet.  It may be a single point
      of failure of inter-datacenter and inter-clouds PaaS service.

      Network potability in inter-datacenters and inter-clouds should
      provide High-Availability capability.


3.  Network Portability Models

   We consider two kinds of network portability models in this draft.
   One is the host-oriented portability model, and the other is the
   network-oriented portability model.

3.1.  Host-oriented Portability Model

   In this model, each host (virtual machine) manages the network
   portability.  To adpot this model, each host must be equipped with
   some kinds of host mobility protocol.  Every time a host migrates
   from one hypervisor to another hypervisor and the attached network
   environment of the migrated host changes, the host must be trigger
   mobility function to adapt the current attached network environment.

3.2.  Network-oriented Portability Model

   In this model, the network resource to which the host is attached
   before migration and after migration does not change.  Since the
   migrated host doesn't notice the network environment change, it can
   continue to work after the migration.  To provide the same network
   environment, the cloud system must support network resource migration
   between the previous location and current location of the host.


4.  Implementation Examples

   In this section, we show some of the implementation example of
   network portability in cloud system.  Section 4.1 describes an
   example of the network-based network portability implementation using
   wide area VLAN configuration.  Section 4.2 describes an example of
   the host-based network portability implementation using Mobile IPv6
   [RFC3775].  Section 4.3 describes another example of the network-
   based network portability implementation using NEMO BS.  [RFC3963]

4.1.  Wide area VLAN-based Network Porability

   One possible solution to provide network portability in a cloud
   system is that to provide a seamless layer 2 network to the entire
   cloud system.  Recently, since the wide area connectivity is getting
   faster and faster, so it becomes realistic to extend a layer 2
   network from one site to other site where is geographically far.

   In this case, the hypervisor and host configuration become simple.

   All the hypervisors are attached to the same layer 2 link which is
   widely extended to every sites which consist the entire cloud system.
   A host is configured with the network which is bridged to the wide
   area layer 2 network.

   The migration procedure does not require any additional configuration
   or operation.  Since all the hypervisors share the same layer 2
   network, hosts can migrate to any one of the hypervisors attached to
   the layer 2 network.

4.2.  Mobile IPv6-based Network Porability

   In this case, all the hosts (which are virtual machines in a cloud
   system) are assumed to have Mobile IP function.  A home agent must
   also exist as a part of the cloud system to serve home network of the
   mobile hosts.

   Each host attaches to any one of the virtual or bridged networks that
   hypervisors provide.  Based on the procedure of the Mobile IPv6, the
   host configures its care-of address using some kinds of address
   configuration mechanisms provided at the attached network, and
   register it with its home address to the home agent.  The detailed
   Mobile IPv6 operation procedure and configuration procedures is not
   described here.

   When a host is migrated from one hypervisor to another hypervisor,
   the network to which the migrated host attached changes, if the
   hypervisors are not attached to the same network segment.  The
   migrated host detects the new network environment using the Mobile
   IPv6 function, and acquire a new care-of address of the network under
   the new hypervisor.

   Similar to Mobile IPv6, the system may need to deploy some mechanisms
   to add high availability function to the home agent, since it is a
   single point of failure of Mobile IPv6-based mechanism.  The
   mechanism for high availability of home agents is out of scope of
   this document.

4.3.  NEMO-based Network Porability

   Another way to provide network portability is to use network mobility
   technology such as NEMO BS [RFC3963].  In this model, the cloud
   operator puts several mobile routers (MRs) in the cloud and assigns
   mobile network prefixes (MNPs) to each of the MR.  The MRs are
   basically hidden to the users of the cloud system.  Users do not need
   to know what is happning when the network migration occurs.

   The MRs are prepared as virtual machines in the cloud system as same

   as other normal host machines.  Since the MNP bound to each MR moves
   with the MR, all the hosts attached to the MNP must also move with
   the MR.  Below is an example operation of the migration procedure
   performed in this case.

   The cloud system first prepares a home network prefix used as a base
   network of all the MRs in the cloud system, and prepares a home agent
   (HA) to serve the network mobility function.  Each MR has two network
   interfaces; one is for the local attachment point to get a care-of
   address, the other is for the presistent network to host other
   virtual machines which move with the MR.

   As many virtual machies as possible can be put on the persistent
   network of the MR, however, when network migration is performed, all
   the machines inside the persistent network must be moved altogether.
   So, if we want to move a virtual machine one by one, we must put only
   one virtual machine in the persistent segment.  It depends on the
   configuration of the service system.  For example, if we design a
   kind of web service system that consists of a web server and a
   backend database server, then we may put these two into the one
   persistent network.  Because those two servers must be on the same
   segment anyway, simultaneous migration will not be a limitation in
   this scenario.

   The persistent networks that are bound to MNPs are virtual networks
   defined in hypervisors.  The requirement to the virtual network is
   that the network must be identified by a virtual machine with a
   static identifier (e.g. the name of the virtual network) independent
   of the hypervisors on which the virtual machine runs.  For example,
   if a virtual machine attaches to a virtual network whose name is
   'mobile-net-1' on hypervisor A and migrates to hypervisor B, then the
   hypervisor B must be able to provide a virtual network which is
   identified by the name 'mobile-net-1'.

   Whem a network is migrated, all the related virtual machines must be
   moved to the same destination hypervisor.  That includes a MR, all
   the hosts attached to the MNP of the MR.  Once a MR migrates to other
   hypervisor, it will detect the external interface status and find
   that the network is changed.  The MR then initiates the procedure of
   NEMO BS, acquires a new care-of address, and registers its new
   location to the HA.  For the hosts inside the MNP, no additional
   action is required, since the network environment of the MNP is
   maintained by the MR and no change happens to that network.

   Similar to Mobile IPv6, the system may need to deploy some mechanisms
   to add high availability function to the home agent, since it is a
   single point of failure of Mobile IPv6-based mechanism.  The
   mechanism for high availability of home agents is out of scope of
