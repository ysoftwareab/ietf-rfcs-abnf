Abstract

   This document advises of the deprecation of the use of "ip6.int" for
   Standards Conformant IPv6 implementations.

Notes

   [START: This section not for RFC publication]

   This memo has been prepared as part of the activities of an ad hoc
   advisory committee to advise the IAB on a number of matters relating

   to IPv6.  It is proposed that the note be published as an Internet
   Standards action for IPv6 as a BCP.

   This advice does not directly address legacy issues relating to
   continued of the "ip6.int" domain.  While the use of the ip6.int
   domain was deprecated in August 2001 upon the publication of BCP 49
   (RFC 3152), the document indicated that the use of the ip6.int domain
   would "likely be phased out in an orderly fashion."

   While it is apparent that implementors of IPv6 protocol stacks have
   noted this advice, and configured more recent IPv6 implementations to
   use the "ip6.arpa" domain as a means of mapping from an IPv6 address
   to a fully qualified domain name, there is still some level of
   activity associated with the ip6.int domain, including continued
   delegation requests and some level of queries.  The justification of
   the operational costs of continued maintenance of this domain is
   questionable, given its deprecated status, the now piecemeal
   population of the domain with delegated zones, and the continuing
   level of confusion to end users and network administrators while two
   reverse mapping domains remain operational.

   This document proposes the action to complete the phase out of
   ip6.int from use in IPv6 for the IPv6 DNS reverse mapping function on
   1 September 2005.

   There has been consideration of the inclusion in this document of an
   examination of the current status of implementations with respect to
   their support of ip6.int, a commentary on the implications of
   operating a protocol stack that continued to attempt reverse
   resolution using ip6.int queries, and an examination of possible
   mechanisms for an indefinite legacy functionality.  This has not been
   done here, as the consideration has been to constrain the scope of
   this document to that of a standards-related action related
   specifically to the deprecation of ip6.int.

   As a further note regarding legacy and backward compatibility
   measures, some exploratory activity has been noted that proposes the
   use of DNAME records in "ip6.int" using a redirection pointer to the
   relevant delegation points in the "ip6.arpa" domain.  There are some
   associated issues with the use of base relative names in reverse
   domains to allow the DNAME to work, and there may also be a need for
   some further investigatory activity relating to the soundness of the
   use of DNAME redirection in this context.  This activity falls more
   into an operational task regarding legacy management, and is
   considered to be outside the intentionally limited scope of this
   particular document.

1.  IPv6 Standards Action

   In August 2001 the IETF published [RFC3152], which advised that the
   use of "ip6.int" as the domain for reverse-mapping of IPv6 addresses
   to DNS names was deprecated.  The document noted that the use of
   "ip6.int" would be phased out in an orderly fashion.

   As of 1 September 2005, the IETF advises the community that the DNS
   domain "ip6.int" should no longer be used to perform reverse mapping
   of IPv6 addresses to domain names, and that the domain "ip6.arpa"
   should be used henceforth, in accordance with the IANA Considerations
   described in [RFC3596].  The domain "ip6.int" is deprecated, and its
   use in IPv6 implementations that conform to the IPv6 Internet
   Standards is discontinued.

   The Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) are advised that maintenance
   of delegation of entries in "ip6.int" is no longer required as part
   of infrastructure services in support of Internet Standards
   conformant IPv6 implementations as of 1 September 2005.  The RIRs are
   requested to work with their communities to adopt a schedule
   regarding cessation of support of registration services for the
   "ip6.int" domain.

2.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is advised that the "ip6.int" domain for reverse mapping of IPv6
   addresses to domain names is no longer part of Internet Standards
   Conformant support of IPv6 as of 1 September 2005.

3.  Security Considerations

   While DNS spoofing of address to name mapping has been exploited in
   IPv4, removal of the "ip6.int" zone from the standard IPv6
   specification creates no new threats to the security of the internet.
