Internet-Draft             MPLS PM UDP Return                  July 2014


1.  Introduction

   This document describes how Packet Loss and Delay Measurement for
   MPLS Networks protocol (MPLS-PLDM) [RFC6374] out-of-band responses
   can be delivered to the Querier using UDP/IP.

   The use of UDP may be required to support data path management such
   as passage through firewalls, or to provide the necessary
   multiplexing needed in bistatic operation where the querier and the
   collector are not co-located and the collector is gathering the
   response information for a number of responders.  In a highly scaled
   system some MPLS-PLDM sessions may be off-loaded to a specific node
   within a the distributed system that comprises the LSR as a whole.
   In such systems the response may arrive via any interface in the LSR
   and need to internally forwarded to the processor tasked with
   handling the particular MPLS-PLDM measurement.  Currently the MPLS-
   PLDM protocol does not have any mechanism to deliver the PLDM
   Response message to particular node within a multi-CPU LSR.

   The procedure described in this specification describes how the
   queryer requests delivery of the MPLS-PLDM response over IP to a
   dynamic UDP port.  It makes no other changes to the protocol and thus
   does not affect the case where the reponse is delivered over a MPLS
   Associated Channel [RFC5586].


2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Solution Overview

   This document specifies that, unless configured otherwise, if a UDP
   Return Object (URO) is present in a MPLS-PLDM Query, the responder
   MUST use the IP address and UDP port in the URO to reply back to the
   querier.  Multiple UROs MAY be present in a MPLS-PLDM Query
   indicating that an identical responses SHOULD be sent to each addess-
   port pair.  A responder MAY be designed or configured to only
   transmit a single response, in which case the response MUST be sent
   using the parameters specified in the first URO in the querry packet.

   The procedures defined in this document may be applied to both
   unidirectional tunnels and bidirectional LSPs.  In this document, the
   term bidirectional LSP includes the co-routed bidirectional LSP
   defined in [RFC3945] and the associated bidirectional LSP that is

Internet-Draft             MPLS PM UDP Return                  July 2014


   constructed from a pair of unidirectional LSPs (one for each
   direction) that are associated with one another at the LSP's ingress/
   egress points [RFC5654].  The mechanisms defined in this document can
   apply to both IP/MPLS and the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP).

3.1.  UDP Return Object

   [Note to reviewers - to be deleted before publication - We considered
   a number of approaches to the design.  The first was to use the
   existing address object and a separate UDP object, but concern in the
   WG was that there may be more than one collector that required this
   information, and the combined size of the two objects.  The next
   approach considered by the authors was to create a new object by
   appending a UDP port to the existing generalized address object.
   However by noting that UDP is only likely to be sent over IP and that
   it will be a long time before we design a third major version of IP
   we can compress the object either by having separate IPv4 and an IPv4
   objects, or using the address length as the discriminator.  The
   object design below uses the latter approach.  The resultant combined
   UDP port + address object is thus the same size as the original
   address object.]

   The format of the UDP Return Object (URO) is as follows:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      | URO TLV Type  | Length={6,18} |    UDP-Destination-Port       |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      ~                           Address                             ~
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   The Type and Length fields are each 8 bits long, and the Length field
   indicates the size in bytes of the remainder of the object (i.e. is
   the size of the address in bytes plus 2).  When the address is IPv4
   the length field is thus 6 and when the address is IPv6 the length
   field is thus 18.  The length field therefore acts as both the TLV
   parsing parameter and the address family type indicator.

   The UDP Return Object Type (URO TLV Type) has a value of <TBD>.

   The UDP Destination Port is a UDP Destination port as specified in
   [RFC0768].

   The Address is either an IPv4 or an IPv6 address.

   The URO MUST NOT appear in a response.

4.  Theory of Operation

   This document defines the UDP Return Object to enable the MPLS-PLDM
   Querier to specify the return path for the MPLS-PLDM reply using IP/
   UDP encapsulation.

   When the MPLS-PLDM Response is requested out-of-band by setting
   Control Code of the MPLS-PLDM Query to "Out-of-band Response
   Requested", and the URO is present, the responder SHOULD send the
   response back to Querier on the specified destination UDP port at the
   specified destination IP address as received in the URO.

   If the URO is expected but is not present in Query message and an
   MPLS-PLDM Response is requested out-of-band, the Query message MUST
   NOT be processed further.  If received over a bidirectional LSP, the
   control code of the Response message MUST be set to "Error - Missing
   TLV" and a Response SHOULD be sent over the reverse LSP.  The receipt
   of such a mal-formed request SHOULD be notified to the operator
   through the management system, taking the normal precautions with
   respect to the prevention of overload of the error reporting system.

4.1.  Missing TLV

   The control code "Missing TLV", which is classified as an Error
   response code, indicates that the operation failed because one or
   more required TLV Objects was not sent in the query message.

4.2.  Sending an MPLS-PM Query

   When sending an MPLS-PLDM Query message, in addition to the rules and
   procedures defined in [RFC6374]; the Control Code of the MPLS-PLDM
   Query MUST be set to "Out-of-band Response Requested", and a URO MUST
   be carried in the MPLS-PLDM Query message.

   If the Querier uses the UDP port to de-multiplexing of the response
   for different measurement type, there MUST be a different UDP port
   for each measurement type (Delay, loss and delay-loss combined).

   An implementation MAY use multiple UDP ports for same measurement
   type to direct the response to the correct management process in the
   LSR.

4.3.  Receiving an MPLS PM Query Request

   The processing of MPLS-PLDM query messages as defined in [RFC6374]
   applies in this document.  In addition, when an MPLS-PLDM Query
   request is received, with the Control Code of the MPLS-PLDM Query set
   to "Out-of-band Response Requested" with a URO present, then the



Bryant, et al.           Expires January 4, 2015                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft             MPLS PM UDP Return                  July 2014


   Responder SHOULD use that IP address and UDP port to send MPLS-PLDM
   response back to Querier.

   If an Out-of-band response is requested and the Address object or the
   URO is missing, the Query SHOULD be dropped in the case of a
   unidirectional LSP.  If both these TLVs are missing on a
   bidirectional LSP, the control code of Response message should set to
   "Invalid Message" and the response SHOULD be sent over the reverse
   LSP.  The receipt of such a mal-formed request SHOULD be notified to
   the operator through the management system, taking the normal
   precautions with respect to the prevention of overload of the error
   reporting system.

4.4.  Sending an MPLS-PM Response

   As specified in [RFC6374] the MPLS-PLDM Response can be sent over
   either the reverse MPLS LSP for a bidirectional LSP or over an IP
   path.  It MUST NOT be sent other than in response to an MPLS-PLDM
   Query message.

   When the requested return path is an IP forwarding path and this
   method is in use, the destination IP address and UDP port MUST be
   copied from the URO.  The source IP address and the source UDP port
   of Response packet is left to discretion of the Responder subject to
   the normal management and security considerations.  The packet format
   for the MPLS-PLDM response after the UDP header is as specified in
   [RFC6374].  As shown in Figure 1 the Associate Channel Header (ACH)
   [RFC5586] is not incuded.  The information provided by the ACH is not
   needed since the correct binding between the Querry and Response
   messages is achieved though the UDP Port and the Session Indentifier
   contained in the RFC6374 message.

                     Figure 1: Response packet Format

   If the return path is an IP path, only one-way delay or one-way loss
   measurement can be carried out.  In this case timestamps 3 and 4 MUST
   be zero as specified in [RFC6374].

4.5.  Receiving an MPLS-PM Response

   If the response was received over UDP/IP and an out-of-band response
   was expected, the Response message SHOULD be directed to the
   appropriate measurement process as determined by the destination UDP
   Port, and processed using the corresponding measurement type
   procedure specified in [RFC6374].

   If the Response was received over UDP/IP and an out-of-band response
   was not requested, that response should be dropped and the event
   SHOULD be notified to the operator through the management system,
   taking the normal precautions with respect to the prevention of
   overload of the error reporting system.


5.  Manageability Considerations

   The manageability considerations described in Section 7 of [RFC6374]
   are applicable to this specification.  Additional manageability
   considerations are noted within the elements of procedure of this
   document.

   Nothing in this document precludes the use of a configured UDP/IP
   return path in a deployment in which configuration is preferred to
   signalling.  In these circumstances the URO MAY be omitted from the

   MPLS-PLDM messages.


6.  Security Considerations

   The MPLS-PLDM system is not intended to be deployed on the public
   Internet.  It is intended for deployment in well manages private and
   service provider networks.  The security considerations described in
   Section 8 of [RFC6374] are applicable to this specification and the
   reader's attention is drawn to the last two paragraphs.
   Cryptographic measures may be enhanced by the correct configuration
   of access control lists and firewalls.

   There is no additional exposure of information to pervasive
   monitoring systems observing LSPs that are being monitored.


7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a new Optional TLV type from MPLS Loss/
   Delay Measurement TLV Object Registry contained within the g-ach-
   parameters registry set.
      Code              Description            Reference
       TBD     Return UDP Port                 [This]

   The TLV 131 is recommended.
