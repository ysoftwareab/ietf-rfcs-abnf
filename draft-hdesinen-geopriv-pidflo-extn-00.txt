Abstract

   The Presence Information Data Format Location Object (PIDF-LO)
   specification provides a flexible and versatile means to represent
   location information.  The XML Schema presented in this memo extends
   the 'geopriv' element defined in PIDF-LO with a complex XML element
   called "device-loc-capabilities".  A device can specify this element
   inside a 'geopriv' element to communicate the position determination
   methods and the location solutions supported by it to a location
   server.  Knowledge of the device's location capabilities can permit a
   server along the path of an emergency voice over IP call to

   immediately initiate position determination update procedures when

1.  Introduction

   The Presence Information Data Format Location Object (PIDF-LO)
   described in [2] is the IETF recommended way of encoding location
   information and associated privacy policies.  The current schema
   defined for PIDF-LO lacks the ability to specify the supported
   location methods and solutions by a device.  The XML schema extension
   described in this document extends the 'geopriv' element described in
   PIDF-LO with a complex XML element called "device-loc-capabilities".
   A device can use this element inside a 'geopriv' element to specify
   the position determination methods and the location solutions
   supported by it.  This may be useful to enable the most appropriate
   location method and solution to be selected by a network server for
   any later positioning.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

3.  Use Case

   A device making an emergency call can use the "device-loc-
   capabilities" extension to convey the position determination methods
   and solutions supported by it.  A location server can use this
   information to communicate with the device and extract the position
   details of the device.  During an emergency call, a location server
   may be able to determine that the currently provided location is
   insufficient or out of date; knowing the client's capabilities allows
   it to initiate the appropriate signalling to update the location
   without wasting time trying mechanisms which the client does not
   support or communicating with other network entities to determine the
   client's capabilities.

4.  Extensions to PIDF-LO to convey device location capabilities

   The XML Schema presented in Section 4.3 extends the 'geopriv' element
   of PIDF with a complex element called 'device-loc-capabilities'.
   There are two subelements that are encapsulated within device-loc-
   capabilities: one for supported position determination methods, and
   one for supported location solutions.  Both of these subelements are
   mandatory, and are described in subsequent sections.  Each subelement
   can be repeated multiple times to specify multiple position
   determination methods and solutions supported by the device.

4.1.  location-method

   Each 'device-loc-capabilities' element MUST contain at least one
   'location-method' element.  Multiple 'location-method' elements can
   be listed to convey multiple position determination methods supported
   by the device.

   An example of this element is:

      <location-method> A-GPS </location-method>

   The possible values of the 'location-method' element are enumerated
   within an IANA registry.  The IANA registry for these values is
   located at http://www.iana.org/assignments/method-tokens.
   Implementations MUST limit the use of this method to the values
   listed by IANA.

4.2.  location-signalling

   Each 'device-loc-capabilities' element MUST contain at least one
   'location-signalling' element.  Multiple 'location-signalling'
   elements can be listed to convey multiple location solutions
   supported by the device.  Each 'location-signalling' element
   identifies a specific position determination signalling procedure as
   specified by an appropriate standards body.  The value combines a
   descriptive name for the signalling procedure and where appropriate a
   version for the published specification.  The version identifier
   specifies an initial version; it implicitly includes all subsequent
   backwards-compatible updates, revisions, and versions.

   An example of this element is:

        <location-signalling> 3GPP_CP_UMTS_1.0 </location-signalling>

   The possible values of the 'location-signalling' element are
   enumerated within an IANA registry.  Implementations MUST limit the
   use of this method to the values limited by IANA.  This document pre-

6.  IANA Considerations for the 'location-signalling' element values

   This document requests that the IANA create a new registry for the
   values of 'location-signalling' element.  The 'location-signalling'
   element value is a text string.  The value string specifies a
   position determination signalling procedure and combines a
   descriptive name for the signalling procedure and where appropriate a
   version for the published specification.  The version identifier
   specifies an initial version; it implicitly includes all subsequent
   backwards-compatible updates, revisions, and versions.

   This section pre-registers eight new values for this element.
   Following are the location signalling values to be registered with
   the IANA.

   o  OMA_SUPL_1.0 (SUPL 1.0)

   o  OMA_SUPL_2.0 (SUPL 2.0)

   o  3GPP_CP_GSM_1.0 (3GPP Control Plane for GSM starting with R98).
      See [4]

   o  3GPP_CP_GPRS_1.0 (3GPP Control Plane for GPRS starting with
      Rel-5).  See [5]

   o  3GPP_CP_UMTS_1.0 (3GPP Control Plane for UMTS starting with R99).
      See [6]

   o  3GPP2_CP_Rev0 (3GPP2 Control Plane Revision 0).  See [7]

   o  3GPP2_UP_X.S0024_Rev0 (3GPP2 User Plane X.S0024 Revision 0).  See
      [8]

   o  3GPP2_UP_V1_V2 (3GPP2 User Plane V1/V2).  See [9]

   Further entries may be registered following the "Specification
   Required" rules as defined in RFC 2434 [3].  For each new
   registration, it is mandatory that a permanent, stable, and publicly
   accessible document exists.

   New values for the 'location-signalling' element SHOULD NOT be
   registered just because an updated version of the referenced
   specification is published.  New values SHOULD only be registered
   when the new version is not backwards compatible with an existing
   registered value.

   This document does not require IANA to assign any values in existing
   registries.

7.  Security Considerations

   Information about the client's capability may provide a hint that
   obfuscation or coarsening has occurred.  (This is also the case with
   the existing 'method' value.)  However, the client capability fields
   are not intended for general dissemination to location recipients;
   this information is primarily of value to a location server.  During
   an emergency call, the location server may be able to determine that
   the currently provided location is insufficient or out of date;
   knowing the client's capability allows it to initiate the appropriate
   signalling to update the location without wasting time and any
   resources while trying mechanisms which the client does not support
   or communicating with other network entities to determine the
   client's capabilities.

   Location servers SHOULD delete the 'device-capabilities' element
   before distributing the pidf-lo object except in the case where the
   location server is aware that an emergency call is being made and a
   downstream server may be able to make use of the information.
