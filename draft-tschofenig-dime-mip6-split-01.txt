1.  Introduction

   In Mobile IPv6 deployment, authentication, authorization and
   accounting issues in the protocol operations are approached by using
   the AAA infrastructure.  The [8] document presents a number of
   bootstrapping scenarios using the HA-AAA interface and defines a list
   of requirements that this interface should cover.  This document
   deals with the functional capabilities of the Diameter protocol as a
   AAA protocol applicable for the split scenario.

   Currently, two Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping solutions exist.  In the
   split scenario, only a HA-AAA interface is considered whereas in the
   integrated scenario both NAS-AAA and HA-AAA interface need to be
   addressed.

   This document focuses only on the split scenario.  A separate
   document describes a Diameter application for bootstrapping MIPv6 for
   the integrated scenario.

2.  Motivation

   Designed to cover network access requirements for AAA protocols [1],
   Diameter protocol provides a framework for applications offering AAA
   services.  This design approach gives to the protocol extensibility,
   interoperability and flexibility in offering AAA solutions in
   comparison to other AAA protocols.  Support of definition of new
   application Ids, commands and AVPs provides extensibility.
   Recommended re-use of commands and AVPs and careful consideration of
   the level of AVP's support provides interoperability.  Usage of IPsec
   and TLS for transport hop-by-hop security, possible support for AVP
   integrity and confidentiality and usage of peer-to-peer model (any
   Diameter node can initiate a request message) provide flexibility of
   the Diameter AAA applications to fit to specific requirements.

   In the following sections we try to specify by which means a possible
   Diameter application would cover the requirements for the HA-AAA
   interface specified in [8].

3.  Bootstrapping Mobile IPv6 in the Split Scenario

   In the split scenario for bootstrapping Mobile IPv6 [2], the MN
   discovers HA through DNS mechanism.  Then it uses IKEv2 [3] to setup
   IPsec SAs.  IKEv2 supports EAP to authenticate the Initiator and thus
   the MN.  As such, the MN can use its credentials (obtained from the
   MSA) to be authenticated for the IPv6 mobility service.  The HA MAY
   rely on a EAP server co-located on a AAA server for this purpose.  In
   this case, a HA-AAA interface is needed.  This interface MUST support
   transport of EAP packets.

   +----+      IKEv2  +----+    Diameter EAP      +---+
   | MN |<----------->| HA |<-------------------->|AAA|
   +----+             +----+                      +---+

   Figure 1: Diameter EAP as the HA-AAA       interface in Split
   scenario

   For this purpose, the HA can use Diameter EAP Application [4] (cf.
   Figure 1).  As shown in the previous section, this protocol fulfill
   goals described in [8]

   MN and HA start with an IKE_SA_INIT to setup the IKE SA.  The MN
   indicates its desire to use EAP by not including the AUTH payload in
   the third message.  However it indicates its identity (e.g.  NAI) by
   using the IDi field.  If the HA supports EAP for authentication, it
   forwards the identity to the AAAH by sending a Diameter-EAP-Request
   (DER) message containing the identity in the EAP-Payload AVP and in
   the User-Name AVP.  Based on this identity, the AAAH chooses an

   authentication method and sends the first EAP-Request in the
   Diameter-EAP-Answer message.  During the EAP authentication phase,
   the HA relays EAP packets between the MN and the AAAH.  If the
   authentication succeeds and if the MN is authorized to use Mobile
   IPv6 service, the AAAH sends a DEA message containing the EAP-success
   and the AAA-Key derived from the EAP authentication method .  Note
   that EAP authentication methods that do not derive keys are not
   recommended.  This key is used by both MN and HA to generate the AUTH
   payload.  In the latter message, MN and HA finish to setup IPsec SAs
   for Mobile IPv6.

4.  Goals

   In presentation of the analysis of goals and possible design
   solutions by Diameter we follow the classification, labels and naming
   assigned in the document [8], where these goals are identified.
   Since several of the issues might be addressed in similar way or by
   similar Diameter functionality, we have grouped these issues and have
   given a general description of the groups.

4.1.  General goals

4.1.1.  G1.1 - G1.4 Security

   As design goals for an AAA interface, G1.1 - G1.4 goals specify
   standard requirements for a AAA protocol - mutual authentication of
   the peers, integrity, replay protection and confidentiality.  IPsec
   or TLS provide the hop-by-hop security.  Combined, they SHOULD be
   able to provide the range of security services required for the HA-
   AAA interface.

4.1.2.  Dead peer detection - the HA-AAA interface SHOULD support
        inactive peer detection.

   Two possible approaches might be considered here:

   o  AAAH server and Home Agent establish a transport connection
      between each other.  In this case Diameter heartbeat messages
      called Device-Watchdog-Request/Answer [1], which are exchanged
      over this connection to test for its aliveness, MAY be used to
      detect inactivity in any of the two Diameter peers.


   o  AAAH server and Home Agent do not have transport connection.  In
      this case inactive peer detection functionality SHOULD be provided
      into the Diameter session - service stateless Diameter sessions
      might be established between the AAAH server and the range of
      MSP's Home Agents for detecting HAs availability.


4.2.  Service Authorization

4.2.1.  G2.1. The HA-AAA interface SHOULD allow the use of Network
        Access Identifier (NAI) to identify the mobile node.

   Identification by User-Name AVP [1], which has a format consistent
   with the NAI specifications, is common for Diameter applications.
   Diameter provides functionality for routing of Diameter requests
   based on the information included in the User-Name AVP.



Tschofenig, et al.      Expires September 7, 2006               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft      MIP6 Bootstrapping with Diameter          March 2006


4.2.2.  G2.2. The HA SHOULD be able to query the AAAH server to verify
        Mobile IPv6 service authorization for the mobile node.

   Based on the peer-to-peer model, Diameter design gives the
   functionality that any Diameter node can initiate a request message.
   This, combined with the support of EAP, would provide flexible
   solutions for this issue.  Currently several Diameter application
   standardized or under work-in-progress address different types of
   authorization - network access [5], credit control [9], quality of
   service [10].  This might allow re-use of present AVPs over the
   AAAH-HA interface.

4.2.3.  G2.3. The AAAH server SHOULD be able to enforce explicit
        operational limitations and authorization restrictions on the
        HA.( e.g. packet filters, QoS parameters).

   Several present Diameter applications, standardized or under work-in-
   progress address an operation and authorization control over specific
   services and have defined appropriate AVPs.  NAS-Filter-Rule AVP,
   defined by Diameter NASREQ application [5], provides IP packet filter
   description.  QoS-Filter-Rule AVP defined by Diameter NASREQ
   application and QSPEC AVP defined by Diameter QoS Authorization [10]
   provide QoS parameter description.  Credit Control application [9]
   provides cost control over requested services.  AVPs MAY be re-used
   for providing required functionality over the AAAH-HA interface.
   This, combined with the possibility that any node can initiate
   request message, gives control to the AAAH server over HA's
   functionality.

4.2.4.  G2.4 - G2.6. Issues addressing the maintenance of a Mobile IPv6
        session by the AAAH server, e.g. authorization lifetime,
        extension of the authorization lifetime and explicit  session
        termination by the AAAH server side.

   Diameter base protocol provides a powerful set of commands and AVPs
   for management of the authorization and accounting sessions.  A
   number of AVPs (Auth-Lifetime-AVP, Grace-Period-AVP, Session-Timeout-
   AVP) handle the duration (in time) of an authorization session [1].
   Additional AVPs for measuring the authorization duration in units
   different that time are specified too [9].  Exchanging of application
   specific authorization request/answer messages provides extension of
   the authorization session.  Initiation of the re-authorization by
   both sides could be supported.  Both sides could initiate session
   termination, by using Diameter Session Termination and Abort Session
   messages.

   All these are applied to the Diameter session used for authorization
   of a Mobile IPv6 session and need to be applied appropriately to this

Internet-Draft      MIP6 Bootstrapping with Diameter          March 2006


   Mobile IPv6 session too.

4.3.  Accounting - G3.1. The HA-AAA interface MUST support the transfer
      of accounting records needed for service control and charging

   Diameter accounting protocol provides a variety of options - real-
   time accounting, event/session-type accounting records, fault
   resilience, correlation of accounting records.  Requirements for the
   accounting services over AAAH-HA interface are standard.  Definition
   or re-used of AVPs for the specific accounting records combined with
   the functionality of the Diameter accounting protocol SHOULD provide
   desired accounting services.

4.4.  Mobile Node Authentication (G4.1.)

   These issues require the functionality of AAAH server working as a
   back-end authentication server and HA working as NAS and EAP
   authenticator in pass-through mode for providing a mobile node
   authentication.  These functionalities are provided by Diameter
   NASREQ and EAP applications, and might be re-used at the AAAH-AH
   interface.[5], [4]

4.5.  Provisioning of Configuration Parameters

   Several AVPs could be re-used for carrying the home address of the NM
   to the AAAH server.  Framed-IPv6-Prefix AVP in conjunction with
   Framed-Interface-Id AVP, Framed-IPv6-Route AVP or Login-IPv6-Host AVP
   defined by NASREQ might be used for home address communication to the
   AAAH [4].

   Even if not explicitly mentioned as goal the AAAH server needs in
   some cases the FQDN from the MN if he should do an DNS update of his
   behalf.  The MN FQDN could be delivered during the IKEv2 exchange
   between the HA and the MN (in the IDii field in IKE_AUTH).  This FQDN
   must, if not already known by the AAAH delivered to it.  [Editor's
   Note: An appropriate AVP for carrying the FQDN has not yet been
   found.]
