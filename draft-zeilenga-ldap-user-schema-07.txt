1. Background and Intended Use

  This document provides descriptions of additional for schema elements
  for use with the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
  [Roadmap].  The elements were originally introduced for use in the
  COSINE and Internet X.500 pilot projects [RFC1274].  This document
  adapts the schema elements for use in modern directory applications,
  while preserving established syntaxes and semantics.

  This document, together with RFC 2247 and [Schema], obsoletes RFC
  1274.  Some of these items were described in the inetOrgPerson
  [RFC2798] schema.  This document supersedes these descriptions.  This
  document, together with [Schema], replaces section 9.1.3 of RFC 2798.

2. Terminology and Conventions

  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
  document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119].

  DIT stands for Directory Information Tree.
  DN stands for Distinguished Name.
  DSA stands for Directory System Agent, a server.
  DSE stands for DSA-Specific Entry.
  DUA stands for Directory User Agent, a client.

  These terms are discussed in [Models].

  Schema definitions are provided using LDAP description formats
  [Models].  Definitions provided here are formatted (line wrapped) for
  readability.

3. Attribute Types

  This section details attribute types for use in LDAP.

3.1. associatedDomain

INTERNET-DRAFT      LDAP: Additional Schema Elements   27 September 2004

  The associatedDomain attribute type specifies DNS domains [RFC1034]
  which are associated with an object.  For example, the entry in the
  DIT with a DN <DC=example,DC=com> might have an associated domain of
  "example.com".

      ( 0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.37 NAME 'associatedDomain'

  attribute conform to the <domain> production [RFC1034].  It is the
  application responsibility to ensure domains it stores in this

  caseIgnoreMatch and caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch rules are described in
  [Syntaxes].

3.16. info

  The info (Information) attribute type specifies any general
  information pertinent to an object.  It is RECOMMENDED that specific
  usage of this attribute type is avoided, and that specific
  requirements are met by other (possibly additional) attribute types.
  Note that the description attribute type [Schema] is available for
  specifying descriptive information pertinent to an object.

      ( 0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.4
        NAME 'info'
        EQUALITY caseIgnoreMatch

INTERNET-DRAFT      LDAP: Additional Schema Elements   27 September 2004

  [Syntaxes].

3.17. mail

  The mail (rfc822mailbox) attribute type holds Internet mail addresses
  in Mailbox [RFC2821] form (e.g.: user@example.com).  1274)

  The IA5String (1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.26) syntax and the
  caseIgnoreIA5Match and caseIgnoreIA5SubstringsMatch rules are
  described in [Syntaxes].

  It is noted that the directory will not ensure that values of this
  attribute conform to the Mailbox production [RFC2821].  It is the
  application responsibility to ensure domains it stores in this
  attribute are appropriately represented.

  Additionally, the directory will compare values per the matching rules
  named in the above attribute type description.  As these rules differ
  from rules which normally apply to Mailbox comparisons, operational
  issues may arise.  For example, the assertion (mail=joe@example.com)
  will match JOE@example.com even though the local-parts differ.   Also,
  where a user has two mailboxes which whose addresses differ only by
  case of the local-part, both cannot be listed as values of the user's
  mail attribute (as they are considered by the caseIgnoreIA5Match rule
  to be equal).

  It is also noted that applications supporting internationalized domain
  names SHALL use the ToASCII method [RFC3490] to produce <sub-domain>
  components of the <Mailbox> production.

3.18. manager

  The Manager attribute type specifies managers of an object represented
  by an entry.

  telephone numbers (e.g., "+44 71 123 4567") associated with a person.

  The organizationalStatus attribute type specifies categories by which
  a person is often referred to in an organization.  Examples of usage
  in academia might include undergraduate student, researcher, lecturer,

  caseIgnoreMatch and caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch rules are described in

3.21. pager

  The pager (Pager Telephone Number) attribute type specifies pager
  telephone numbers (e.g., "+44 71 123 4567") for an object.

3.26. uniqueIdentifier

  The Unique Identifier attribute type specifies a "unique identifier"
  for an object represented in the Directory.  The domain within which
  the identifier is unique, and the exact semantics of the identifier,
  are for local definition.  For a person, this might be an institution-
  wide payroll number.  For an organizational unit, it might be a
  department code.  An attribute value for uniqueIdentifier is a
  DirectoryString.

        (2.5.4.45) which is called 'x500UniqueIdentifier' in LDAP
        [Schema].  The attribute detailed here ought not be confused
        with x500UniqueIdentifier.

3.27. userClass

  The userClass attribute type specifies categories of computer user.
  The semantics placed on this attribute are for local interpretation.
  Examples of current usage of this attribute in academia are
  undergraduate student, researcher, lecturer, etc.  Note that the
  organizationalStatus attribute type is now often be preferred as it
  makes no distinction between computer users and others.

        MUST associatedDomain )

  The top object class is described in [Models].  The associatedDomain
  attribute type is described in Section 3 of this document.

4.5.  friendlyCountry

  The friendlyCountry object class is used to define country entries in
  the DIT.  The object class is used to allow friendlier naming of
  countries than that allowed by the object class country [Schema].

      ( 0.9.2342.19200300.100.4.18
        NAME 'friendlyCountry'
        SUP country STRUCTURAL
        MUST co )
