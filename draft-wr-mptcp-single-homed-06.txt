           Multipath TCP Support for Single-homed End-systems
                     draft-wr-mptcp-single-homed-06

Abstract

   Multipath TCP relies on the existence of multiple paths between end-
   systems.  These are typically provided by using different IP
   addresses obtained by different ISPs at the end-systems.  While this
   scenario is certainly becoming increasingly a reality (e.g. mobile
   devices), currently most end-systems are single-homed (e.g. desktop
   PCs in an enterprise).  It seems also likely that a lot of network
   sites will insist on having all traffic pass a single network element
   (e.g. for security reasons) before traffic is split across multiple
   paths.  This memo therefore describes mechanisms to make multiple
   paths available to multipath TCP-capable end-systems that are not
   available directly at the end-systems but somewhere within the
   network.

1.  Introduction

   The IETF has specified a multipath TCP (MPTCP) architecture and
   protocol where end-systems operate a modified standard TCP stack
   which allows packets of the same TCP connection to be sent via
   different paths to an MPTCP-capable destination ([RFC6824],
   [RFC6182]).  Paths are defined by sets of source and destination IP
   addresses.  Using multiple paths has a number of benefits such as an
   increased reliability of the transport connection and an effect known
   as resource pooling [resource_pooling].  Most end-systems today do
   not have multiple paths/interfaces available in order to make use of
   multipath TCP, however further within the network multiple paths are
   the norm rather than the exception.  This memo therefore describes
   ways how these multiple paths in the network could potentially be
   made available to multipath TCP-capable hosts that are single-homed.

   In order to illustrate the general mechanism we make use of a simple
   reference scenario shown in Figure 1.

                       Figure 1: Reference Scenario

   The scenario in Figure 1 depicts e.g. a possible SOHO or enterprise
   setup where a gateway/router is connected to two ISPs and a DHCP
   server gives out leases to hosts connected to the local network.
   Note that both, the gateway and the DHCP server could be on the same
   device (similar to current home gateway implementations).

   The host is running a multipath-capable IP stack, however it only has
   a single interface.  The methods described in the following sections
   will let the host make use of the gateway's two interfaces without
   requiring modifications to the MPTCP implementation.

2.  Approaches to Use Multiple Paths in the Network

   All approaches in this document do not require changes to the wire
   format of MPTCP and both communicating hosts need to be MPTCP-
   capable.  The benefit this approach has is that a) it has no
   implications on MPTCP standards, b) it will hopefully encourage the
   deployment of MPTCP as the number of scenarios where MPTCP brings
   benefits vastly increases and c) these approaches do not require
   complex middle-boxes to implement MPTCP-like functionality in the
   network as other approaches have suggested before.

2.1.  Exposing Multiple Paths Through End-host Auto-configuration

   Multipath TCP distinguishes paths by their source and destination IP
   addresses.  Assuming a certain level of path diversity in the
   Internet, using different source and destination IP addresses for a
   given subflow of a multipath TCP connection will, with a certain
   probability, result in different paths taken by packets of different
   subflows.  Even in case subflows share a common bottleneck, the
   proposed multipath congestion control algorithm [RFC6356] will make
   sure that multipath TCP will play nicely with regular TCP flows.

   In order to not require changes to the TCP implementation, we keep
   the above assumptions multipath TCP makes, i.e. working with

   different IP addresses to use different paths.  Since the end-system
   is single-homed, all IP addresses are bound to the same physical
   interface.  In our reference scenario in Figure 1, the host would
   e.g. receive more than one RFC1918 [RFC1918] private IP address from
   the DHCP server as depicted in Figure 2.

                        Figure 2: Gateway internals

   The gateway that is shown in Figure 2 has received two IP addresses,
   one from each ISP that it is connected to (ISP1 and ISP2).  The NAT
   that the gateway is implementing needs to "map" each private IP
   address of the host consistently to a one of the addresses received
   by the ISPs, i.e. each private IP to a different public IP.  Packets
   sent by the host to the gateway are then routed based on the source
   address found in the packets as illustrated in the figure.  In other
   words, depending on the source address of the host, the packets will
   either go through ISP 1 or ISP 2 and TCP will balance the traffic
   across those two links using its built-in congestion control
   mechanism.

   The way the gateway has received its public IP addresses is not
   relevant.  It could be via DHCP, IPCP or static configuration.  In
   order to configure the hosts behind the gateway, we propose to make
   use of provisioning domains [RFC7556], more specifically one
   provisioning domain per external gateway interface (the two
   interfaces to ISP1 and ISP2 in Figure 2).  In order to signal to the
   host, that each provisioning domain will result in a different path
   towards the Internet, this memo introduces a new DHCP option called
   EXT_ROUTE, which will be included in each provisioning domain sent by
   the server.  The option value will determine which external interface
   is used to sent the traffic when using the configuration information
   present in the respective provisioning domain.

Internet-Draft             single-homed MPTCP               October 2015


   Upon receipt of a DHCP offer including multiple provisioning domains,
   or multiple offers each including one or more provisioning domains,
   the client SHOULD create up to n virtual interfaces, where n is one
   less than the number of different EXT_ROUTE option values found in
   all received provisioning domains.  Each virtual interface will
   contact the DHCP server and will request configuration information
   for the respective provisioning domains, excluding the configuration
   of the physical interface.

2.2.  Heuristic Use of Multiple Paths

   The auto-configuration mechanism above has the advantage that
   available paths and information on how to use them are directly sent
   to the end-host.  In other words, there is an explicit signalling of
   the availability of multiple paths to the end-host.  This has the
   advantage that the host can efficiently use these paths.

   This method works well when multiple paths are available close to the
   end-host and means for auto-configuration are available.  But that is
   not always the case.  Another method to use different paths in the
   network without prior knowledge of their existence is to apply
   heuristics in order to exploit setups where Equal Cost Multi-path
   [RFC2991], a widely deployed technology [ECMP_DEPLOYMENT], or similar
   per-flow load-balancing algorithms are employed.

   The ADD_ADDR option defined in [RFC6824] can be used to advertise the
   same address but a different port to open another subflow.
   Additionally, the MP_JOIN option can also be used to open another
   subflow with the same IP address and e.g. a different source port
   given that a different address ID is used.  This means there are
   multiple scenarios possible (e.g. either sender-initated or receiver-
   initiated) where single-homed end-hosts can influence the 5-tuple
   (source and destination IP addresses and port numbers plus protocol
   number) which is often used as the basis for per-flow load balancing.
   Changing the 5-tuple will only with a certain probability result in
   using a different path unless the load-balancing algorithm that is
   used is known to the MPTCP implementation (an assumption we cannot
   generally make).  This means that a number of subflows might end up
   on the same path.  Fortunately, the MPTCP congestion control
   algorithm will make sure that the collection of subflows on that path
   will not be more agressive than a single TPC flow.

3.  Other scenarios and extensions

   The reference scenario is only one conceivable setting.  Other
   scenarios such as DSL broadband customers or mobile phones are
   conceivable as well.  As an example, take the DSL scenario.  The home
   gateway could be provided with multiple IP addresses using extensions

   to IPCP.  The home gateway in turn can then implement the DHCP server
   and gateway functionality as described before.  More scenarios will
   be described in future versions of this document.

4.  Alternative approaches

   One alternative is that a DHCP server always sends n offers, where n
   is the number of interfaces at the gateway to different ISPs.  The
   client could then accept all or a subset of these offers.  This
   approach seems interesting in environments where there are multiple
   DHCP servers, one for each ISP connection (think multiple home
   gateways).  However, accepting multiple offers based on a single DHCP
   request is not standard's compliant behavior (at least for the DHCPv4
   case).  Also, to cater for a scenario that only contains a single
   DHCP server, server changes are needed in any case.  Finally, correct
   routing is not always guaranteed in these scenarios.

   An interesting alternative is the use of ECMP at the gateway for load
   distribution and let MPTCP use different port numbers for subflows.
   Assuming that ECMP is available at the gateway, this approach would
   work fine today.  The only drawback of the approach is that it
   involves a little trial and error to find port numbers that actually
   hash to different paths used by ECMP [RFC2991].
