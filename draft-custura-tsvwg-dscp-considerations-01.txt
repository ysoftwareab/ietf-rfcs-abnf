1.  Introduction

   The Differentiated Services (DiffServ) architecture has been deployed
   in many networks.  It provides differentiated traffic forwarding
   based on the value of the Diffserv field [RFC2474] carried in the IP
   packet header.

Internet-Draft    Considerations for assigning a DSCPs        March 2021


   This document discusses considerations for assigning a new DiffServ
   Code Point (DCSP).  It considers some commonly observed DSCP
   remarking behaviours that might be expected to be experienced along
   an Internet path.  It also notes some packet forwarding treatments
   that a packet can receive when using a specific DSCP.

   The document is motivated by new opportunities to use DiffServ end-
   to-end across multiple domains, such as [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-nqb],
   proposals to build mechanisms using DSCPs in other standards-setting
   organisations, and the desire to use a common set of DSCPs across a
   range of infrastructure (e.g., [I-D.learmonth-rfc1226-bis]).

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Current usage of DSCPs

   This section describes current usage of DSCPs.

3.1.  IP-Layer Semantics

   The DiffServ architecture specifies use of the Diffserv field in the
   IPv4 and IPv6 packet headers to carry one of 64 distinct DSCP values.
   Within a given administrative boundary, each DSCP value can be mapped
   to a distinct Per Hop Behavior (PHB)[RFC2474].  When a new PHB is
   standardized, a recommended DSCP value among those 64 values is
   normally reserved for that PHB.

   The DSCP space is divided into three pools for the purpose of
   assignment and management [DSCP-registry].  The pools are defined in
   the following table (where 'x' refers to either a bit position with
   value '0' or '1').

   DSCP Pool 1  A pool of 32 codepoints with a format 0bxxxxx0, to be
      assigned by IANA Standards Action [RFC8126].

   DSCP Pool 2  A pool of 16 codepoints with a format 0bxxxx11, reserved
      for experimental or local (private) use by network operators (see
      sections 4.1 and 4.2 of [RFC8126].

   DSCP Pool 3  A pool of 16 codepoints with a 0bxxxx01.  This was
      initially available for experimental or local use, but which was
      originally specified to be preferentially utilised for
      standardized assignments if Pool 1 is ever exhausted.  Pool 3

Internet-Draft    Considerations for assigning a DSCPs        March 2021


      codepoints are now utilised for standardized assignments and are
      no longer available for experimental or local use [RFC8436].

   The DiffServ architecture allows forwarding treatments to be
   associated with each DSCP, and the RFC series describes some of these
   as PHBs.  Although DSCPs are intended to identify specific treatment
   requirements.  Multiple DSCPs might also be mapped (aggregated) to
   the same forwarding treatment.  Several IP standards map treatment
   aggregates to DSCPs, that might result in remarking: RFC5160
   [RFC5160] suggests Meta-QoS-Classes to help enable deployment of
   standardized end-to-end QoS classes.

   Note: A DSCP is sometimes referred to by name, such as "CS1", and
   sometimes by a decimal, hex, or binary value [DSCP-registry].

3.2.  Network Control Traffic

   Network Control Traffic is defined as packet flows that are essential
   for stable operation of the administered network (see [RFC4594],
   Section 3).  This traffic is marked using a set of Class Selector
   (CS) DSCPs.  Such network control traffic is often a special case
   within a provider network, and ingress traffic with these DSCP
   markings can be remarked.

   DSCP CS2 is recommended for the OAM (Operations, Administration, and
   Maintenance) service class (see [RFC4594], Section 3.3).

   The DCSP CS6 is recommended for local network control traffic.  This
   includes routing protocols and OAM traffic that are essential to
   network operation administration, control and management.
   Section 3.2 of RFC4594 [RFC4594] recommends that "CS6 marked packet
   flows from untrusted sources (for example, end user devices) SHOULD
   be dropped or remarked at ingress to the DiffServ network".

   DSCP CS7 is reserved for future use by network control traffic.  "CS7
   marked packets SHOULD NOT be sent across peering points" [RFC4594].

4.  Remarking the DSCP

   It is a feature of the DiffServ architecture that the Diffserv field
   of packets can be remarked at domain boundaries (see section 2.3.4.2
   of RFC2475 [RFC2475]).  A DSCP can be remarked at the ingress of a
   DiffServ domain.  This can be with or without restoring the initial
   DSCP marking at the egress of the same domain.  The Diffserv field
   can also be re-marked based upon common semantics and agreements
   between providers at an exchange point.

Internet-Draft    Considerations for assigning a DSCPs        March 2021


   If packets are received that are marked with an unknown or an
   unexpected DSCP, RFC2474 [RFC2474] recommends forwarding the packet
   using a default (best effort) treatment, but without changing the
   DSCP.  This seeks to support incremental DiffServ deployment in
   existing networks as well as preserving DSCP markings by routers that
   have not been configured to support DiffServ.  (See also
   Section 4.3).

   Reports measuring existing deployments have categorised DSCP
   remarking [Custura] [Barik] into the following six behaviours:

   Bleach:  bleaches all traffic (sets the DSCP to zero);

   Bleach-ToS:  sets the first three bits of the DCSP field to 0b000
      (resets the 3 bits of the former ToS Precedence field) ;

   Remark-ToS:  sets the first three bits of the DCSP field to 0b001
      (replace the 3 bits of the former ToS Precedence field);

   Remark-ToS:  sets the first three bits of the DCSP field to 0b010
      (replace the 3 bits of the former ToS Precedence field);

   Reset-low:  sets the last three bits of the DCSP field to 0b000;

   Reset-some-low:  sets the last three bits of the DSCP field to 0b000,
      unless the first two bits of the DSCP field are 0b11;

   Remark:  remarks all traffic to one or more particular (non-zero)
      DSCP values.

4.1.  Bleaching the DSCP Field

   A specific form of remarking occurs when the DiffServ field is re-
   assigned to the default treatment, CS0 (0x00).  This results in
   traffic being forwarded using the BE PHB.  For example, AF31 (0x1a)
   would be bleached to CS0.

   Resetting all the bits of the DiffServ field to 0 is more prevalent
   at the edge of the network, and rather less common in core networks
   [Custura].

4.2.  IP Type of Service manipulations

   The IETF defined ToS precedence field for IP packets in RFC1349
   [RFC1349].  Since 1998, this practice has been deprecated by RFC2474
   [RFC2474].  RFC 2474 defines codepoints 0x xxx000 as the Class
   Selector codepoints, where PHBs selected by these codepoints MUST

   meet the Class Selector PHB Requirements" described in Sec. 4.2.2.2
   of that RFC.

   However, practices based on ToS semantics have not yet been
   eliminated from Internet, and these need to still currently be
   considered when making new DCSP assignments.

4.2.1.  Impact of ToS Precedence Bleaching

   ToS precedence bleaching (/Bleach-ToS/) is a practice that resets to
   zero the upper 3 bits of the DSCP field (the former ToS Precedence
   field), leaving the lower bits unchanged.  This behaviour is
   distinctive of non-DiffServ aware routers and one of the more common
   manipulations of the DiffServ field.

   Figure showing the ToS bleaching pathology, based on Section 3 of
   RFC1349 [RFC1349].

   If ToS precedence bleaching occurs, packets with a DSCP 'x' would be
   remarked and then would be treated according to the PHB specified for
   'x' & 0x07.  For example, AF31 (0x1a) would be remarked to DSCP 2
   (0x02).

   A variation of this behaviour clears the top three bits of a DSCP,
   unless these have values 0b110 or 0b111 (corresponding to CS6 and
   CS7).  As a result, a DSCP value greater than 48 decimal (0x30) is
   less likely to be impacted by ToS precedence bleaching.

4.2.2.  Impact of ToS Precedence Remarking

   Practices based on ToS precedence RFC1349 [RFC1349] were deprecated
   by RFC2474 [RFC2474].  These practices based on ToS semantics have
   not yet been eliminated from Internet.

   A less common behaviour, ToS precedence remarking /Remark-ToS/ sets
   the upper three bits of the DSCP field to a non-zero value
   corresponding to a CS PHB.  This behaviour is distinctive of non-
   DiffServ aware routers.

   If remarking occurs, packets are treated using the PHB specified for
   the resulting codepoint.  For example, the AF31 DSCP (0x1a) could be
   remarked to AF11 or AF21.

4.3.  Remarking to a Particular DSCP

   A network device might remark the Diffserv field of an IP packet
   based on a local policy to avoid marking with a specific (set of)
   DSCPs, /remark/. This is sometimes performed using a Multi-Field (MF)
   classifier [RFC2475] [RFC3290] [RFC4594].  For example, a common
   behaviour is to mark all traffic to a single DSCP, thus removing any
   traffic differentiation (see Section 4.1).  Bleaching (/Bleach/) is a
   specific example of this.

   In another example, some networks do not follow the recommendation in
   RFC2475 [RFC2475], and instead remark packets with an unknown or
   unexpected DSCP to the default class, CS0 (0x00) to ensure that
   appropriate DSCPs are used within a DiffServ domain.  (e.g., see
   [RFC8100]).

5.  Interpretation of the IP DSCP at Lower Layers

   Transmission systems and subnetworks can, and do, utilise the
   Diffserv field in an IP packet to select a lower layer forwarding
   treatment.  In many cases, this use is constrained by designs that
   utilise fewer than 6 bits to express the service class, and therefore
   infer mappings to a smaller L2 QoS field, for example, WiFi or Multi-
   Protocol Label Switching (MPLS).

5.1.  Mapping Specified for IEEE 802.11

   << This section is currently incomplete. >>

   A 3-bit Priority Code Point (PCP) is specified in the IEEE 802.1Q tag
   to mark Ethernet frames to one of eight priority values.  The value
   zero indicates the default best effort treatment, and the value one
   indicates a background traffic class.  The remaining values indicate
   increasing priority.  Internet control traffic can be marked as six,
   and network control is marked as seven.

   Section 6 of RFC 8325 RFC 8325 [RFC8325] provides a brief overview of
   IEEE 802.11 QoS.  The IEEE 802.11 standards [IEEE-802-11] provides
   MAC functions to support QoS in WLANs using Access Classes (AC).  The

   upstream User Priority (UP) in the 802.11 header has a 3-bit QoS
   value.  A DSCP can be mapped to the UP.  Most existing WiFi
   implementations [RFC8325] use a default mapping that utilises the
   three most significant bits of the DiffServ Field to the 802.11 UP.
   This is then in turn mapped to the four WiFi Multimedia (WMM) Access
   Categories.

   RFC 8325 [RFC8325] proposes several recommendations for mapping a
   DSCP to an IEEE 802.11 UP for wired-to-wireless interconnection.  The
   DSCP value of a downstream IP packet can be used (e.g., the Control
   And Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) protocol,
   RFC5415, maps an IP packet Diffserv field to the Diffserv field of
   outer IP headier in a CAPWAP tunnel).

   Some current constraints of WiFi mapping are discussed in section 2
   of RFC 8325 [RFC8325].  A QoS profile can be used to limit the
   maximum DSCP value used for the upstream and downstream traffic.

   |x x x|. . .|
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+


   Figure showing the DSCP bits commonly mapped to the UP in 802.11.

   This UP mapping can result in a specific DSCP remarking pathology.
   In the upstream direction, some Access Points (APs) currently use a
   default UP-to-DSCP mapping RFC8325 [RFC8325], wherein "DSCP values
   are derived from the layer 2 UP values by multiplying the UP values
   by eight (i.e., shifting the three UP bits to the left and adding
   three additional zeros to generate a 6 bit DSCP value).  This derived
   DSCP value is then used for QoS treatment between the wireless AP and
   the nearest classification and marking policy enforcement point
   (which may be the centralized wireless LAN controller, relatively
   deep within the network).  Alternatively, in the case where there is
   no other classification and marking policy enforcement point, then
   this derived DSCP value will be used on the remainder of the Internet
   path."  This behaviour can result in remarking /Reset-low/.

   RFC8325 [RFC8325] notes inconsistencies that can result from such
   remarking, and recommends how to perform this remarking.

5.2.  Mappings Specified for MPLS

   In MPLS there are eight MPLS Traffic Classes (TCs), which restricts
   the number of different treatments (e.g., see [RFC5129]).  RFC 5127
   describes aggregation of DiffServ TCs [RFC5127], and introduces four
   DiffServ Treatment Aggregates.  Traffic marked with multiple DSCPs
   can be forwarded in a single MPLS TC.

   ITU-T Y.1566 [ITU-T-Y-1566] further defined a set of four common QoS
   classes and four auxiliary classes to which a DSCP can be mapped when
   interconnecting Ethernet, IP and MPLS networks.  RFC8100 [RFC8100]
   proposes four treatment aggregates for interconnection with four
   defined DSCPs.  This was motivated by the requirements of MPLS
   network operators that use Short-Pipe tunnels, but can be applicable
   to other networks, both MPLS and non-MPLS.

   RFC8100 recommends preserving the notion of end-to-end service
   classes, and recommends that the original DSCP marking is not changed
   when treatment aggregates are used.  The key requirement is that the
   DSCP at the network ingress is restored at the network egress.  This
   is only feasible in general for a small number of DSCPs.  In this
   design, packets marked with other DSCPs can be re-marked (This can
   result in the /Remark/ behaviour) or dealt with via an additional
   agreement(s) among the operators of the interconnected networks.  Use
   of the MPLS Short Pipe Model favours re-marking unexpected DSCP
   values to zero in the absence of an additional agreement(s), as
   explained in RFC8100 [RFC8100].  This can result in the remarking:
   /Bleach/.

5.3.  Mapping Specified for Mobile Networks

   << This section on Standardized 5QI to QoS characteristics mapping is
   currently incomplete. >>

   [SA-5G].

   The GSM Association (GSMA) defines four traffic classes and seven
   associated DSCPs in their guidelines for IPX Provider networks GSMA
   IR.34 [GSMA-IR-34].  This was previously specified as the Inter-
   Service Provider IP Backbone Guidelines.

5.4.  Mappings Specified for Carrier Ethernet

   << This section on metro Ethernet Forum (MEF) mapping is currently
   incomplete. >>

Internet-Draft    Considerations for assigning a DSCPs        March 2021


5.5.  Remarking as a Side-effect of Another Policy

   The result of applying a QoS policy (such as matching the IP address,
   or traffic reaching a rate limit) could also result in a packet being
   remarked to a different DSCP when it is not admitted to a service.
   Traffic marked with an EF and VA DSCP are often policed by such
   policies.

   Policies and L2 procedures can also result in remarking traffic as a
   side-effect of other functions (e.g., in response to DDos).

6.  Considerations for DSCP Selection

   This section provides advice for the assignment of a new DSCP value.

   Diffserv domains can use the codepoints in Pool 2 for local or
   experimental use.

   New IETF assignments are normally made in Pool 1, but can also be
   made from Pool 3.

6.1.  Effect of Bleaching

   New DSCP assignments should consider the impact of bleaching, which
   can limit the ability to provide the expected treatment end-to-end.
   This is particularly important for cases where the codepoint is
   intended to result in lower than best effort treatment, as was the
   case when defining the LE PHB [RFC8622].  In this case, bleaching, or
   remarking to "CS0" would result in elevating the lower effort traffic
   to the default class.  This is an example of priority inversion.

6.2.  Where the proposed DSCP > 0x07 (7)

   Although the IETF requires systems use DSCP marking semantics for the
   former ToS field, the current recommendation is that any new
   assignment where the codepoint is greater than 0x07 should consider
   the semantics associated with the resulting DSCP when ToS precedence
   bleaching is experienced.  For example, it can be desirable to avoid
   choosing a DSCP that could be remarked to LE, Lower Effort [RFC8622],
   which could otherwise potentially result in a priority inversion in
   the treatment.

6.3.  Where the proposed DSCP < 0x07 (7)

   ToS bleaching can unintentionally result in extra traffic aggregated
   to the same DSCP.  For example, after experiencing ToS bleaching, all
   traffic marked AF11, AF21, AF31 and AF41 would be aggregated with
   traffic marked with DSCP 2 (0x02), increasing the volume of traffic



Custura, et al.        Expires September 16, 2021              [Page 10]

Internet-Draft    Considerations for assigning a DSCPs        March 2021


   which receives the treatment associated with DSCP 2.  New DiffServ
   codepoint assignments should consider unexpected consequences arising
   from ToS bleaching.

6.4.  Where the proposed DSCP&&0x07=0x01

   As a consequence of assigning the LE PHB [RFC8622], the IETF
   allocated the DSCP 000001b from Pool 3.

   When making assignments where the DSCP has a format: xxx 001b, the
   case of ToS Precedence Bleaching of a DSCP to a value of 0x01 needs
   to be considered.  ToS Precedence Bleaching will result in demoting
   the traffic to the lower effort traffic class.  Care should be taken
   to consider the implications that a DSCP in this category could be
   remarked as LE.

6.5.  Impact on deployed infrastructure

   Behaviour of deployed PHBs and conditioning treatments also needs to
   be considered when assigning a new DSCP.  In some domains, a network
   operator can provide transparent transport of unknown or unassigned
   DSCPs across their domain.  In other domains, policing can ensure
   that only traffic that matches a policy is permitted to use a
   specific DSCP (e.g., as in MPLS TC).

7.  Acknowledgments

   The authors acknowledge the helpful discussions and analysis by Greg
   White and Thomas Fossati in a draft concerning NQB.  We look forward
   to further comments and review.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This memo provides information to assist in considering new
   assignments the IANA DSCP registry (https://www.iana.org/assignments/
   dscp-registry/dscp-registry.xhtml).

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

9.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations are discussed in the security
   considerations of each cited RFC.
