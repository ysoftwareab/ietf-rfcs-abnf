1. Abstract

   RSVP [RFC 2205] signaling messages typically include policy data
   objects, which in turn contain policy elements. Policy elements may
   describe user and/or application information, which may be used by
   RSVP aware network elements to apply appropriate policy decisions to
   a traffic flow. This informational draft details the usage of policy
   elements that provide application information.

2. Overview

   RSVP aware network elements may act as policy enforcement points
   (PEPs). These work together with policy decision points (PDPs) to
   enforce QoS policy. Briefly, PEPs extract policy information from
   RSVP signaling requests and compare the information against
   information stored in a policy database or directory. A policy
   decision is made based on the results of the comparison.


bernet                                                               1

   One type of policy information describes the application on behalf
   of which an RSVP signaling request is generated. When application
   policy information is available, network administrators are able to
   manage QoS based on application type. So for example, a network
   administrator may establish a policy that prioritizes known mission
   critical applications over games.

   We propose a hierarchical structure for application policy elements.
   Specifically, the highest level of the hierarchy specifies an
   application name. The next level specifies a version. At the next
   level, an arbitrary number of sub-applications may be specified. An
   example of a sub-application is 'print data'.

   In this draft, we show the structure of the application policy
   element. We also propose keywords for the various levels of the
   hierarchy. However, we do not enumerate values for applications,
   version numbers or sub-applications. Such an enumeration is beyond
   the scope of this draft.

3. Application Policy Element Structure

   General application policy elements are defined in [identity]. These
   are policy elements with a P-type of AUTH_APP (value 3). Following
   the policy element header is a list of authentication attributes.

   The first authentication attribute should be of the A-type
   POLICY_LOCATOR (value 1). The sub-type of the POLICY_LOCATOR
   attribute should be of type ASCII_DN (value 1) [RFC 1779]. The
   actual attribute data is formatted as an X.500 distinguished name
   (DN), representing the application, version number and sub-
   application.

   The second authentication attribute should be of the A-type
   CREDENTIAL (value 2). The sub-type of the CREDENTIAL attribute is of
   type ASCII_ID. The actual attribute data is an ASCII string
   representing the application name.

   This structure is illustrated in the following diagram:

      |                         (e.g. SAP.EXE)                        |

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   The policy locator attribute for an application policy element is
   conformant with the X.500 DN format[RFC 1779]. We propose the
   following keywords:

   Key  Attribute
   --------------
   APP  Application Name
   VER  Application Version Number
   SAPP Sub Application

   The following is an example of a conformant policy locator:

   APP=SAP, VER=1.1, SAPP=Print

4. Security Considerations

   The proposed simple policy element does not guarantee that element
   is indeed associated with the application it claims to be associated
   with. In order to provide such guarantees, it is necessary to sign
   applications. Signed application policy elements may be proposed at
   a future date. Note that typically, the application policy element
   will be included in an RSVP message with an encrypted and
   authenticated user policy element. A level of security is provided
   by trusting the application policy element only if the user policy
   element is trusted.

   All RSVP integrity considerations apply to the message containing
   the application policy element.
