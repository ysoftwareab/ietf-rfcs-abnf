1. Introduction

   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) ([BIER-ARCH]) is an
   architecture that provides optimal multicast forwarding through a
   "multicast domain", without requiring intermediate routers to
   maintain any per-flow state. BIER doesn't engage in any explicit
   tree-building protocols, it can be thought of implicitly created
   P2MP tunnels from each "Bit Forwarding Ingress Router" (BFIR) to all
   the "Bit Forwarding Egress Routers" (BFERs) in the BIER domain. BIER
   is potentially applicable to many services where Multicast is used,
   especially as P-Tunnel for MVPN, EVPN, etc.

                     Figure 1 BIER Active-active access

   As illustrated in figure 1, to provide redundant connectivity, a CE
   is normally connected to multiple BFRs through an Ethernet Link
   Aggregation Group with LACP [802.1AX], the CE can be a multicast
   source or receiver. The BFRs offering multi-homing is called Active-
   Active BFR (AABFR) group.  In Active-Active case, the following two
   problems for multicast packet forwarding should be solved:



   1.Duplicated delivery of flooding traffic

   The issue occurs on the multi-homed BFERs connecting to one or more
   multicast receivers. If more than one BRER out of the AABFR group
   egress a copy of a multicast packet from BIER domain, the Multicast
   receiver will see packet duplication. Therefore, it is REQUIRED that
   a unique BFER is appointed as the multicast egress BFR. This unique
   multicast egress NVE can be appointed according to a unanimous
   agreed designated forwarder (DF) election algorithm by all BRRs in a
   AABFR group. The election algorithm should be used to ensure service
   carving balance among different BFRs in a redundant group, the
   service carving factor can be based on VPN instance, multicast group,
   access VLAN, etc, so it is carried service dependant rather than
   service agnostic. The DF election process defined in [EVPN] is an
   example for DF PE determination.



   2.Loop & Echo Forwarding among multi-homed PEs.

   The issue occurs on the multi-homed BFIRs connecting to one or more
   multicast sources. Assuming a multicast source S1 is multi-homed to
   BFIR1 and BFIR2 using an Ethernet Link Aggregation Group with LACP
   [802.1AX], when S1 sends a multicast packet to BFIR1, the BFIR1 will
   inject the packet to BIER domain and the packet will be received by
   BFIR2 from the BIER domain, then BFIR2 will perform BIER
   decapsulation and send the packet to S1 again. Split-horizon
   filtering mechanism should be used to prevent the loop between BFIR1
   and BFIR2. The split-horizon mechanism relies on the packet from
   ingress device carrying origin identification to identify the
   segment from which the frame entered the BIER network, the egress

   device performs filtering function based on the origin
   identification. The split-horizon mechanism should be service
   agnostic and should be maintained in transport layer, i.e, BIER
   should provide the Split-horizon capability.

   In summary, BIER as a transport layer technology, it should provide
   split-horizon capability for active-active access and can be shared
   by all multicast services. As for DF election mechanism, it should
   be provided in each multicast service. This document will define the
   data plane and control plane extension respectively for BIER split-
   horizon mechanism.

2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   The terms and acronyms in [RFC6325] are used with the following
   additions:

      o  Ethernet Segment (ES): When a customer site (device or network)
   is connected to one or more PEs via a set of Ethernet links, then
   that set of links is referred to as an 'Ethernet segment'.

      o  Ethernet Segment Identifier (ESI): A unique non-zero
   identifier that identifies an Ethernet segment is called an
   'Ethernet Segment Identifier'.

      o  MVPN: Multicast Virtual Private Network -- a VPN [RFC4364] in
   which multicast service is offered.

      o  P-tunnel. A multicast tunnel through the network of one or
   more SPs. P-tunnels are used to transport MVPN multicast data.

3. Solution overview

   Every BFR track the BFID(es) associated with the other BFR(s) with
   which it has shared multi-homed Ethernet Segments. When the BFIR
   receives a multi-destination frame from the BEIR domain, it examines
   the source BFID in the BIER header (which corresponds to the BFIR)
   and filters out the frame on all local interfaces connected to
   Ethernet Segments that are shared with the ingress BFR.

   Each BFIR performs replication locally to all directly attached
   Ethernet Segments for all flooded traffic ingress from the access

   interfaces (i.e. from the multicast source). This approach is
   referred to as "Local Bias".

4. Data plane format

   In [BIER-MPLS], the BIER header format is defined as follows:
      0                   1                   2                   3

   BFIR-id field is the BFR-id of the BFIR, it can be used for split-
   horizon filtering.

5. Discovery of Multi-homing BFRs

   Each Ethernet segment is assigned a global ESI as Ethernet segment
   identification. The ESI can be manually configured or automatically
   derived.

   A couple of different mechanisms are available to derive the ESI
   automatically, such as snooping LACP packets or LLDP packets. Once
   the ESI for an Ethernet segment is assigned for a multi-homed CE, it
   is advertised by the BFRs through IS-IS or OSPF extension.

   The following two ESI values are reserved:

      - ESI 0 denotes a single-homed site.

      - ESI {0xFF} (repeated 10 times) is known as MAX-ESI and is
   reserved.

      In general, an Ethernet segment SHOULD have a non-reserved ESI
   that is unique network wide (i.e., across all EVPN instances on all
   the PEs).

5.1. IS-IS extension

   BIER Info sub-TLV (Section 6.1 [BIER-ISIS])carries the information
   for the BIER sub-domains that the router participates in as BFR. A
   newly defined BIER ESI sub-sub-TLV carries the information of local
   ESIs and is carried within the BIER Info sub-TLV that the router
   participates in as BFR. The BIER ESI sub-sub-TLV format is as
   follows:
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |Type(1 octet)  |Length(1 octet)|
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |Ethernet Segment Identifier (1) (10 octets)                    |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                   ... ...                                     |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |Ethernet Segment Identifiern (N) (10 octets)                   |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   Type: TBD

   Length: 1 byte

   Ethernet Segment Identifier: It is encoded as a 10-octet integer in
   line format with the most significant octet sent first.



5.2. OSPF extension

      BIER ESI Sub-TLV is a sub-TLV of the BIER Sub-TLV [BIER-OSPF].
   BIER ESI Sub-TLV is used in order to advertise local connecting ESI
   used for BIER. The BIER ESI sub-TLV format is as follows:
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |Type(2 octet)  |Length(2 octet)|
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |Ethernet Segment Identifier (1) (10 octets)                    |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                   ... ...                                     |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |Ethernet Segment Identifiern (N) (10 octets)                   |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   Type: TBD

   Length: 1 byte

   Ethernet Segment Identifier: It is encoded as a 10-octet integer in
   line format with the most significant octet sent first.

   Implementations must assure that malformed TLV and Sub-TLV
   permutations do not result in errors which cause hard protocol
   failures.
