      Unified Control Architecture for Optical Transport Networks
               draft-chen-unified-control-architecture-00

Abstract

   This memo specifies a unified control architecture for Optical
   Transport Network (OTN) based on Software Defined Networking (SDN).
   The architecture can be applied over multi-domain multi-vendor
   networks.

1.  Introduction

   This memo introduce an Software Defined Networking (SDN) based
   architecture to monitor and analyse physical parameters on various
   types of network equipments, and control the adjustable part of whole
   parameters.  SDN is a programmable networks approach that supports
   the separation of control and forwarding plane via standardized
   interfaces, and make equipments foolish while centralizing control
   function on a logical entity named Controller.  The controller can
   achieve rapid and accurate fault location, dynamic parameter
   adjustment, device aging forecast, and cross-layer optimization via
   this memo.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

4.  Motivation and Goals

   In order to support various cloud services which are remote and
   geographically distributed, we need a high-capacity, high-reliability
   and high-flexibility network.  Optical network, as a strong
   candidate, could provide energy-efficiency, dynamic control, and
   recent technology advancements including software defined network
   (SDN) support.  Software defined optical network (SDON), which allows
   carriers to control the optical network using software running on a
   network operating system, leads to a more flexible control manner.

   On the other hand, in today's commercial optical transport networks
   (OTN), different domains, especially equipment of different vendors,
   are separately operated without dynamic interaction, which leads to
   low network efficiency, high OPEX and CAPAX.  In light of this, some
   latest activities have tried to apply SDON/Openflow to multi-domain
   optical networks.  This results in a lack of universality for
   promoting a unified control manner for multi-vendor multi-domain OTN.

4.1.  Architecture

   The unified control orchestrator (UCO) architecture for multi-vendor
   multi-domain OTN is illustrated.  The architecture aims to achieve
   the port discovery, resources collection, routing path computing, OTN
   connection creation, and connection deletion. 4 layers are presented
   for the required functions.
