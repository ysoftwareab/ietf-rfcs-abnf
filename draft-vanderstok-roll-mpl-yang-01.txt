1.  Introduction

   This document defines a YANG [RFC6020] data model for management of
   Multicast Protocol for Low power and lossy Networks (MPL) [RFC7731]
   implementations.  The data model covers configuration of per-
   interface MPL parameters.  It also provides information about which
   Multicast addresses are operationally used, and the seeds for which
   packets are forwarded

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The following terms are defined in [RFC6241] and are not redefined
   here:

   o  client

   o  configuration data

   o  server

Internet-Draft                  MPL-YANG                       June 2016


   o  state data

   The following terms are defined in [RFC6020] and are not redefined
   here:

   o  data model

   o  data node

   The terminology for describing YANG data models is found in
   [RFC6020].

   Terms like domain, seed, I, k, c are defined in [RFC7731].

1.1.1.  Tree Diagrams

   A simplified graphical representation of the data model is used in
   the YANG modules specified in this document.  The meaning of the
   symbols in these diagrams is as follows:

      Brackets "[" and "]" enclose list keys.

      Abbreviations before data node names: "rw" means configuration
      data (read-write) and "ro" state data (read-only).

      Symbols after data node names: "?" means an optional node, "!"
      means a presence container, and "*" denotes a list and leaf-list.

      Parentheses enclose choice and case nodes, and case nodes are also
      marked with a colon (":").

      Ellipsis ("...") stands for contents of subtrees that are not
      shown.

2.  MPL model

   This document defines the YANG module "ietf-yang-mpl", which
   specifies a data model for MPL servers.  The model consists of the
   following parts: (1) a "mpl-domain" part that describes the MPL-
   domains and associated Multicast addresses and the interfaces on
   which the Multicast addresses are enabled, (2) a "mpl-op" part that
   describes the parameters settings per seed, (3) a "mpl-seeds" part
   that describes the MPL buffer contents and the Trickle timer values,
   and (4) a "mpl-statistics" part that describes the number of lost and
   correctly forwarded messages.  The data model, divided in four
   modules, has the following structure for MPL configuration per node:

3.  yang-mpl modules

   This section describes four yang modules.  The model is based on the
   MPL specification published in [RFC7731] and the specification of
   [RFC6206].  The identification of the interfaces follows the
   specification of ietf-interfaces of [RFC7223].

   The data model allows to set values to the parameters of the MPL
   algorithm.  This approach requires an active manager process to set
   the values without use of DHCP as described in: [RFC7774].

   The names of the four modules are: yang-mpl-domain, yang-mpl-ops,
   yang-mpl-seeds, and yang-mpl-statistics, described in subsections
   with the same name.

3.1.  yang-mpl-domain module

   This modules describes (1) the MPL domains and the associated
   multicast addresses, and (2) the interfaces and the multicast
   addresses for which they are enabled.

   The model features a choice such that for constrained devices with
   only one "single" interface and only one "single" domain, the model
   specifies a list of MC addresses for which the single interface is
   enabled.

3.2.  yang-mpl-ops module

   This module models the operational aspects of MPL.  Per domain MPL
   specifies four parameters I_MAX, I_MIN, K, and TIMER_EXPIRATIONs for
   data and control messages.  The value of the MPL intervals are
   expressed in TUNIT.  The entry SE_LIFETIME taken over from [RFC7774]
   fixes TUNIT to milliseconds.  For very constrained devices with only
   one domain there can be only one instance of mpl-parameter list.

3.3.  yang-mpl-seeds module

   This module specifies the current values of the operation of the MPL
   forwarder.  The values are acquired by the client and set by the
   server.  The module specifies a set of message buffers, with a buffer

Internet-Draft                  MPL-YANG                       June 2016


   per seed and domain.  In constrained devices there will be only one
   domain, but probably multiple seeds.

   The message buffer contains a set of messages where each message is
   uniquely identified by its sequence number and seed.  The associated
   I, c, e, and t values indicate the progress of MPL with respect to
   this message, as specified in [RFC7731].  A forwarder sends and
   receives multiple copies of a message.  When a forwarder has sent
   (received) a copy of a message, the forwarder has sent (received)
   that message.

   For forwarders which are seeds, local has value true and seqno is the
   sequence number of the next message to send.

3.4.  yang-mpl-statistics module

   This module specifies the operation of the MPL forwarder expressed in
   number of messages and copies.  The values are acquired by the client
   and set by the server.  Statistics are specified per seed and domain.
   In constrained devices there will be only one domain, but probably
   multiple seeds.

   The parameter k determines how many copies of a message can be
   forwarded.  The counters c-too-high, nr-forwarded, and nr-not-
   forwarded give insight in the consequences of the current value of k.

   The other counters give insight in the loss of messages caused by the
   medium or forwarding delays.  The inconsistent/consistent counters
   indicate when consistent or inconsistent messages were received
   according to the definition of consistent in [RFC7731].
