Abstract

Given the large installed base of ring fiber-plants and the extensive 
experience operators have gained in operating SONET/SDH ring networks, 
optical rings are becoming increasingly important.  As such, optical 

Ghani et. al.								[Page 1]

rings will play a crucial role in the migration from existing TDM-based 
SONET/SDH architectures to more dynamic lightpath provisioning 
paradigms.  To date, various optical ring concepts have been tabled, 
proposing multi-services support and mirroring the fast protection 
switching capabilities of existing SONET/SDH rings.  Nevertheless, the
emerging MPL(ambda)S/GMPLS framework for optical networks is largely
based upon (optical) mesh routing concepts.  Clearly, there is a strong
need to formalize a more comprehensive architectural framework for 
optical rings and ensure its proper integration within the emerging
MPL(ambda)S/GMPLS architecture.  Along these lines, the various optical 
ring schemes are summarized and their associated dynamic provisioning 
concerns detailed.

1. Introduction

Many networks today are based upon fiber-ring architectures, as 
evidenced by the proliferation of SONET/SDH rings all the way from
the long-haul backbone to the metropolitan and regional areas.  Most
larger backbone rings represent significant investments on the
part of service providers, and expectedly will have longer lifetimes.
Additionally, in the regional metro space, hierarchical SONET/SDH
ring architectures are also very commonplace.  For example, at the 
access-side, smaller (optical carrier/synchronous transfer module) 
OC-3/STM-1 (155 Mb/s) tributary rings are used to aggregate and groom 
traffic from enterprise customers.  These rings are then connected to
larger granularity OC-12/STM-4 (622 Mb/s) and possibly OC-48/STM-16 
(2.5 Gb/s) rings spanning larger metropolitan distances.  Metropolitan 
rings are then used to feed into even larger regional (and possibly 
long-haul) fiber-ring topologies with increased bit rates, such as 
OC-192/STM-64 (10 Gb/s).  As a result, ring architectures will clearly
play a major role in the evolution of optical networks.

Given this large, entrenched base of ring topologies, currently many 
operators are planning for a migration to equivalent dynamic optical
ring architectures.  Dynamic optical rings can be defined as fiber
rings with dynamic lightpath provisioning capabilities (such as 
routing, add/drop, and protection).  These optical wavelength routing 
rings, commonly also referred to as optical add-drop ring multiplexer 
(O-ADM) rings, will form the mainstay architecture for most metro/
regional and even long-haul networks, helping operators ease their 
transition to future optical (mesh or hybrid ring-mesh) networks.  
Since many operators have significant experience in deploying and 
maintaining SONET/SDH rings, future optical analogs of such time-
division multiplexing (TDM) ring switching are of great transitional 
value.  Here, wavelength channels (as opposed to TDM circuits) undergo 
bypass, add, or drop operations at ring network elements [MARCENAC].  
Optical rings will allow operators to immediately leverage their current 
fiber topologies and avoid lengthy fiber-expansion costs (i.e., 
associated with deploying mesh networks).  Furthermore, ADM-based ring 
architectures are well-known for their operational simplicity and
inherently fast protection switching capabilities, and perhaps, this 
is the main reason for the widescale acceptance of SONET/SDH technology.
Network operators have become well-accustomed to the fast, timely 
recovery capabilities provided by SONET/SDH automatic protection 
switching (APS) schemes, such as uni-directional path switched rings 
(UPSR)/1+1 sub-network connection protection (SNCP) and bi-directional 
line switched rings (BLSR)/multiplex section shared protection rings 
(MS/SPRINGs) [GR1230],[T1.105.01],[G.841].  These architectures can 
achieve service recovery within 50 ms after a fault event, via 

Ghani et. al.								[Page 4]

detailed electronic frame monitoring and fast protection switchover 
signaling provisions.

Meanwhile, recently there have also been significant developments in 
extending the ubiquitous multi-protocol label switching (MPLS) framework 
to the optical networking domain, namely "IP over optical" via 
MPL(ambda)S [AWDUCHE],[GHANI1],[RAJAGOPALAN] and more recently, 
generalized MPLS (GMPLS) [ASHWOOD1],[XU].  Nevertheless, given its 
origins from (mesh) IP packet routing networks, this framework as it 
stands today, is largely geared to support dynamic optical mesh networks.
Conversely, no standards exist for optical rings and most offerings do 
not provide dynamic channel routing (add-drop) capabilities, relying 
instead upon proprietary, static solutions.  Now given the abundance and
strategic importance of ring fiber-plants (as detailed above), it is 
crucial to extend the existing MPL(ambda)S/GMPLS framework to provision 
dynamic optical ring networks.  Although some may state that rings are 
special cases of meshes (technically speaking), the various intricacies 
of ring networks require special attention in the MPL(ambda)S/GMPLS 
framework.  As most long-haul optical networks continue to migrate 
towards mesh-based GMPLS/MPL(ambda)S setups, along with increasingly 
MPLS-based "client" router networks, intermediate metro/regional 
networks (largely ring-based) must also evolve to a similar architecture.
Such a uniform provisioning framework will permit true optical services 
provisioning across all network/geographic domains.

In particular, the MPL(ambda)S/GMPLS framework must address ring 
channel provisioning and protection switching functions.  Undoubtedly, 
optical (ring) solutions must provide equivalent, or improved, 
capabilities in order to replace TDM rings in a timely manner.  Since 
each fiber (or wavelength) in an optical network can now carry a much 
higher degree of multiplexed traffic, APS capabilities are even more 
crucial.  This report details an architectural framework for optical 
rings, representing a logical, structured evolution (expansion) from 
existing SONET/SDH (TDM) ring paradigms.  Optical ring equivalents of 
SONET/SDH protection schemes are presented and detailed provisioning 
issues outlined within the context of the broader MPL(ambda)S/GMPLS 
framework.

2. Framework for Optical Rings

Many of the proposed concepts in optical ring networks derive their 
origins from those in SONET/SDH ring networks.  Here it is assumed that
readers are familiar with basic SONET/SDH constructs, albeit a brief 
introduction is presented in the Appendix (Section 4).  Due to the 
inherent transparency of optical switching technologies, optical rings 
can develop significantly upon existing TDM SONET/SDH rings.  Namely, 
the concept of "transparent" optical rings is envisioned, permitting a 
full range of protocols/bit-streams being carried in their native format, 
e.g., SONET/SDH, ATM, IP, GFP, ESCON, SDL, Gigabit Ethernet, etc.  
Note that there are also standardization efforts to define generic 
mappings/encapsulations for data protocols, such as the generic framing
procedure (GFP) [GFP] for the optical payload unit (OPUk), as defined 

Ghani et. al.								[Page 5]

in ITU-T G.709 [G709].  Fundamentally optical ring network elements must 
perform the optical "equivalents" of TDM ADM channel operations: pass-
through, add, drop, and fast APS functions [ARIJIS],[MARCENAC].  
Expectedly, "active" operations are implied here, otherwise the 
principles of dynamic wavelength provisioning, and hence MPL(ambda)S/
GMPLS are largely inapplicable.  Specifically, TDM circuit/timeslots are 
now replaced by wavelength-based lightpath entities.  These requirements 
can be met by either using optical add-drop multiplexer (O-ADM) or 
optical cross-connect (OXC)/wavelength routing switch (WRS) nodes.  
With regards to the latter, purely optical nodes can also be further 
classified as photonic cross-connect (PXC) nodes.  The latter types 
(OXC, PXC) are well-suited to larger inter-ring connection (i.e., 
switching) applications, which require added (mesh) spatial switching
capabilities.  Note that the terms O-ADM, OXC, and PXC in the context 
herein are used to refer to complete ring node systems (and not just
node sub-systems as may be done in a more detailed context).

         Figure 1: Sample optical ring node (2-fibers shown)

A generic overview of a two-fiber optical ring device is shown in 
Figure 1 and can easily be extended for four-fiber rings.  Optical 
demux (mux) devices split (combine) wavelength channels (wavelength 
bands) from incoming (outgoing) fibers and connect to a wavelength 
channel (band) add/drop/protection unit.  This stage can be implemented 
using a variety of techniques, such as optical switches (e.g., micro-
electro-mechanical systems (MEMS), bubble, thermo-optic, etc), 
digital/electronic cross-point switches (DXC/EXC), or simpler 2x1 
switching devices.  The add/drop channels help to form the access stage 
of a ring node and this is where signals are mapped/de-mapped onto/from 
wavelength transmitters/receivers.  Optionally, O-E designs can perform 
edge SONET/SDH (or digital wrappers [G.709]) payload mapping at the 
access stage.

Overall, optical ring nodes can exhibit many different levels of 
functionality.  For example, purely optical add-drop/switching fabrics 
are incapable of performing wavelength conversion but offer true signal
format transparency.  Conversely, EXC-based designs using opto-

Ghani et. al.								[Page 6]

electronic (O-E) conversion techniques will not have wavelength 
interchange restrictions, but will reduce signal format transparency.
Therefore, as a tradeoff, "hybrid" designs are also possible, using EXC 
switches or tunable lasers to offer partial wavelength conversion 
capabilities for selected wavelengths and/or links.  Moreover, numerous 
studies have shown that partial wavelength conversion capabilities yield 
network blocking probabilities close to those achieved with full 
wavelength conversion switches (i.e., O-E based).  Hence, for the 
foreseeable future, optical networks will comprise of non-conversion and
conversion-capable devices.  Note that all-optical wavelength conversion 
techniques are also being actively researched, but commercial components 
are not yet available.  Given all these variations of optical ring 
nodes, is important to define an optical ring framework that, to the 
extent possible, is independent of implementation and encompasses all 
(or as many of) these possibilities.

 Figure 2: Mapping between SONET (SDH) and optical ring architectures

To date, the ANSI T1X1 and ITU-T SG15 have been most active with regards 
To work/proposals for optical ring architectures, e.g., see [CHEN],
[CVIJETIC1-2],[SOULLIERE].  Although this work represents a good starting
point, detailed standards (comparable to SONET UPSR, BLSR) are yet to 
emerge.  Overall, optical ring proposals are classified into two major 
types, namely dedicated protection rings (DPRING) and shared protection 
rings (SPRING), and this delineation is re-used here to define the 
conceptual framework.  The general relationship between SONET/SDH and 
proposed/emerging WDM (optical) shared/dedicated ring architectures is 
shown in Figure 2, and details are discussed subsequently.  More specific 
provisioning (signaling) requirements are treated in Section 3.  Note 
that the terms optical channel and lightpath are used in an 
interchangeable manner to represent wavelength circuits.  Furthermore, 
the prefix "O" is used to identify "optical" ring concepts, in order to 
clearly discern them from existing TDM ring (SONET/SDH) schemes.

2.1 Dedicated Path Protection Rings (DPRING)

Dedicated protection rings are relatively simple in design and usually 
associated with two-fiber uni-directional (path-switched) O-ADM rings, 
O-UPSR/2.  These rings can implement "edge-to-edge" wavelength channel 

Ghani et. al.								[Page 7]

protection, and are therefore more commonly termed as optical channel 
DPRING (OCh-DPRING) [ARIJIS].  Note that the term "edge-to-edge" is 
chosen here, referring to a "sub-network" connection (SNC) entity, since 
it is most germane to a single ring (domain) and not necessarily a 
complete "end-to-end" client connection, see [XUE].  Both the 1+1 
(non-signaled) and 1:1 (signaled) protection switching paradigms can be 
used herein.  Each fiber in a OCh-DPRING carries wavelength channels in 
counter-propagating directions, with one fiber each for working and 
protection channels.  The 1+1 OCh-DPRING solution is similar to SONET 
UPSR rings, with bi-directional connections consuming wavelength 
resources on all fibers, i.e., permanent head-end bridging.  This OCh-
DPRING scheme is shown in Figure 3 for a uni-directional channel.  Note 
that an all-optical OCh-DPRING will likely require the same wavelength 
value on the working and protection path (i.e., unless ingress traffic 
bridging is done onto two separate wavelength transmitters).  Since 
receiver-based switchovers are performed, no complex signaling protocols 
are required for 1+1 optical protection unless 1+1 bi-directional 
switching is employed (see [MANCHESTER1]).  However, there is normally 
an added power penalty when performing optical head-end bridging, e.g., 
if a single laser's output signal is head-end bridged [SOULLIERE].

      Figure 3: 1+1 wavelength path protection (2-fiber OCh-DPRING)

Additionally, signaled 1:1 protection is also conceivable for the 
OCh-DPRING, essentially re-using protection wavelengths for lower-
priority traffic, i.e., head-end switching [SOULLIERE].  This requires 
an optical APS signaling protocol that has yet to be specified, a
major task.  However, note that overhead bytes have been proposed in the 
ITU for the OMS level, as per G.709 [G.709], and these can be used for 
conveying APS signaling.  Although 1:1 channel protection improves upon 
idle resource utilization here, it still has limited spatial wavelength 
re-use and is rather disruptive (i.e., full ring/path switch can affect 
many users, albeit lower pre-emptable priority).  The 1:1 OCh-DPRING 
structure is shown in Figure 4, where the lower-priority lightpath C-D 
occupies a protection wavelength/span for lightpath A-D.  Overall, 
however, signaled protection is mostly proposed for more advanced shared

(line, path) ring architectures, Section 2.2.  Note that the co-
existence of both 1+1 and 1:1 OCh protection mechanisms in the same two-
fiber DPRING may also be possible (i.e., since the underlying fiber/
wavelength plan is the same).  However this issue requires further, 
more careful investigation of non-homogeneous ring behaviors.

      Figure 4: 1:1 wavelength path protection (2-fiber OCh-DPRING)

Note that depending upon the ring node's fault detection mechanism, 
switchover signaling can be actuated using a variety of methods (see 
Section 2.4, Section 3.2).  For example, translucent designs using 
"inband overhead" monitoring (as defined by SONET B1-bytes [GR1230]
or digital wrappers defect indicator bytes [G.709]) can detect
progressive signal degradation and estimate bit-error rate (BER) 
values, etc.  Inband overhead byte monitoring can also be used to 
detect progressive signal degradation.  Alternatively, for transparent 
optical rings, optical monitoring techniques, such as power or 
signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) can be used to detect fiber (or 
wavelength) faults, Section 2.4.

In summary, the OCh-DPRING scheme requires full (100%) protection 
resource overhead and cannot achieve spatial re-use, somewhat akin 
to SONET UPSR rings.  Hence, the OCh-DPRING scheme is best suited 
for hubbed traffic demands, where wavelength counts (and not spatial
traffic demand distributions) are the dominant factors.

2.2 Shared Protection Rings (SPRING)

Shared protection ring (SPRING) architectures are designed to improve 
upon spatial resource utilization over UPSR designs.  These rings are 
derived from SONET BLSR rings and are usually more complex, requiring 
active signaling for fast recovery.  Overall, two shared ring schemes 
have been proposed, namely at the optical multiplex section (OMS) and 
the optical channel (OCh) level, respectively.  In all such schemes, bi-

Ghani et. al.								[Page 9]

directional connections between two endpoint nodes must traverse the 
same set of intermediate nodes.  Details are now presented (see also
[ARIJIS]).

2.2.1 Optical Multiplex Section-Shared Protection Rings (OMS-SPRING)

Fiber cuts are one of the most common faults in ring networks, and given 
the increased multiplexing of DWDM systems, it is very desirable to also
protect at the fiber span (i.e., OMS) level.  Since per-channel 
protection switching can involve excessive signaling for large channel 
counts, fiber (i.e., optical line) protection can be much more scalable.
Fiber protection basically provides an alternate fiber path between two 
adjacent nodes experiencing a fiber cut, and usually also requires 
signaling between the two end-points of fiber cut.  Fiber protection is 
best applied to "fiber-rich" four-fiber rings, although two-fiber 
schemes are also possible.  However, carefully note that line protection 
requires fiber fault detection and isolation capabilities, unlike end- 
to-end channel protection.  A variety of OMS shared protection rings 
are possible, termed OMS-SPRING, and details are presented.

Two-fiber OMS-SPRING line (fiber) protection schemes, termed herein as 
O-BLSR/2, are very similar conceptually to SONET BLSR/2 designs.  For 
example, to permit resource sharing and (intra-fiber) coordination 
between working/protection channels, these rings require a wavelength
numbering/assignment scheme to effect a grouping between working and 
protection channels.  This essentially creates two "virtual fibers" from
each physical fiber, albeit each with only half the number of 
wavelengths.  The rules for such a partitioning are somewhat similar to 
those for timeslot partitioning in SONET BLSR/2 rings.  Specifically, 
each fiber has an equal number of working and protection wavelengths 
traveling in the same direction, and the working wavelength group in a 
given fiber corresponds to the protection wavelength group in the other 
fiber.  This implies that opposing directions will be routed on the same 
side (i.e., through common nodes) but use different fibers.  Note that
the intra-fiber wavelength plan requirement of O-BLSR/2 rings complicates 
ring node design (e.g., if O-E based or all-optical based).  Also, for 
all-optical rings, added wavelength numbering qualifications are required
to enforce the wavelength-continuity constraint.  In particular, the 
actual wavelength values within each group (working, protection) have to 
match each other, thereby precluding the need for wavelength conversion 
upon switchover events.  For example, the first (W/2) fiber wavelengths 
can be assigned for working channels, whereas the last (W/2) wavelengths 
can be assigned for protection channels.  This condition can be relaxed 
for translucent (O-E) node designs, where wavelength values can also be 
interchanged upon protection switching.

        Figure 5: Loop-back span protection (O-BLSR/2)

Two-fiber OMS-SPRING (O-BLSR/2) protection is possible using "loop-
back" protection (i.e., conceptually similar to SONET BLSR/2 rings), 
namely, all failed fiber wavelengths are re-routed on to the protection 
fiber route on the counter-propagating side of the ring, see Figure 5.
Again, wavelength continuity concerns may arise for all-optical rings.  
As expected, protection signaling is done on the far-side.  Albeit an
alternative, optical loop-back protection, however, is not very 
attractive since it increases the distance and transmission delay of the
restored channels (nearly doubling path lengths, as per SONET BLSR/2).  
Related analog degradations and other parameters will likely further 
hinder applicability, especially in all-optical rings.  Furthermore, 
loop-back protection fully consumes protection fiber resources and 
limits recovery to single fiber-cut faults at any given time.  As a 
result, it is unlikely that two-fiber OMS loop-back schemes (O-BLSR/2) 
will see much favor in practical settings.

       Figure 6: Span protection, loop-back and near-side (O-BLSR/4)

Span switching is much more attractive for four-fiber rings since 
protection fibers have the same wavelength directionality as working 
fibers.  By logically extending SONET BLSR/4 architectures, four-fiber 
OMS-SPRING schemes can also be defined to protect against fiber cuts, 
termed O-BLSR/4.  Clearly, these rings can implement loop-back (i.e., 
far-side) span protection by simply re-routing all failed working 
wavelengths on a fiber onto their associated, counter-propagating 
protection fiber (like O-BLSR/2).  This will extend the channel routes 
as shown in Figure 6 (e.g., lightpath A-D protection via A-B-A-C-D, 
lightpath B-D protection via B-A-C-D).  Far-side loop-back switching is 
especially attractive if all working-side fibers are cut (e.g., conduit 
fault), but again suffers from increased analog degradations.

Unlike two-fiber rings, four-fiber OMS-SPRING designs also enable more 
interesting and less-disruptive "near-side" protection switching.  This 
form of protection switching is largely designed to protect against 
fiber (and channel) failures, and not node failures.  One of its main 
purposes is to relegate protection signaling actions to the failed side 
of the ring (i.e., working, near-side).  In other words, the "dual-
directional" nature of fiber diversity of the four-fiber ring is 
exploited to maintain the same edge-to-edge node route between working 
and protection paths.  Near-side protection switching is a generic 
concept that can be applied on both the line and path levels.  The line-
level case is illustrated for the O-BLSR/4 scheme in Figure 6, where 
the failed wavelengths are routed to the same-direction protection fiber 
on the near-side (only single direction shown for two working lightpaths 
A-D, B-D, traversing the outer working fiber).  Overall, near-side line
switching improves resource efficiencies since it does not disrupt 
traffic along the whole (long-side) protection route, as per loop-back 
techniques.  However, near-side switching is less robust since it can 
only protect against working fiber faults, and not those that may also
affect near-side protection fibers.

2.2.2 Optical Channel-Shared Protection Ring (OCh-SPRING)

Bi-directional SONET rings have only considered line protection since
individual channel (time-slot) failures within the ring were considered
relatively rare.  However, when considering the types of failures that
optical rings may be required to protect against, yet another type of 
SPRING design may emerge as a more viable alternative to a simpler 
optical analog of two- and four-fiber multiplex-section SPRING's, namely 
the optical channel-level SPRING (OCh-SPRING).  Specifically, for the 
case of both all-optical and transponder-based (i.e., translucent) 
optical rings, the need arises to protect against isolated opto-
electronic (source or intermediate wavelength transmitter/receiver) 
failures that will affect only a single optical channel entity at a time.
This implies the need for a protection architecture that performs OCh-
level switching, based upon OCh-level indications, independently for 

Ghani et. al.								[Page 12]

each optical channel on the ring.  As the OMS-SPRING switches based upon 
OMS-level failure indications, and switches all optical channel entities 
as a group within the OMS, it is incapable of protecting lightpath 
connections independently of one another based upon OCh-level failure
indications.  A protection architecture that can protect optical channels
individually based upon per-channel failure indications is the OCh-SPRING 
[MANCHESTER1], as facilitated by per-wavelength routing/processing/
monitoring capabilities.  In other words, this is essentially the optical 
bi-directional path switched ring (O-BPSR) concept for shared protection 
rings.  Again, two variants of the OCh-SPRING are possible, namely for 
two- (O-BPSR/2) and four-fiber (O-BPSR/4) rings.

    Figure 7: Bi-directional path protection schemes (O-BPSR/2)

The O-BPSR/2 proposal is based upon 1:1 wavelength protection (i.e., 
signaled switchover) and utilizes the same wavelength plan as its line-
switching counterpart, O-BLSR/2.  The scheme implements full bi-
directional edge-to-edge switching on the "far-side" of the ring, i.e., 
on the side away from the fault.  For example, lightpath A-D (D-A) 
re-routed from A-B-D (D-B-A) to A-C-D (D-C-A), Figure 7.  Again, 
depending upon the translucency level, wavelength continuity may be 
required along all edge-to-edge routes.  Channel switchovers are 
performed for channels in both directions, regardless of which one 
actually failed.  This is more beneficial in case of both working and 
protection fiber cuts on the working side, e.g., conduit cuts.  Lightpath 
faults are detected by downstream nodes (see Section 2.4), which then 
effect switchover actions via expedited upstream signaling along the 
far-side (albeit no standards are defined yet).  Clearly, far-side 
edge-to-edge path switching will be the most disruptive, since (lower-
priority) traffic and fast signaling are required on the opposite side 
of the ring.  However, far-side switching can protect against 
intermediate node failures.  It should, however, be noted that signaling
latencies will dictate maximum ring sizes (node count limits) for all 
edge-to-edge ring switching schemes.

Ghani et. al.								[Page 13]

By utilizing the SPRING wavelength plan, O-BPSR/2 solutions also
significantly improve spatial resource sharing over their UPSR 
counterparts, especially for "non-hubbed" traffic demands [ARIJIS].
Furthermore, differing levels of protection resource sharing can also 
be allowed.  For example, obviously, idle protection wavelengths can be 
used to carry lower-priority pre-emptable traffic (termed 1:1 shared).
Furthermore, protection wavelengths (on the far-side) themselves can be
shared between multiple working channels.  This achieves a "1:N" 
protection resource multiplexing effect for each wavelength (hop), and 
not just the complete protection path.  This feature improves resource
efficiency significantly, especially for all-optical rings without 
wavelength conversion, and will yield reduced call setup blocking 
probabilities.  Additionally, customers transporting relatively low-
priority (cost) traffic may be satisfied with pre-emptable lightpath
connections, namely ones that can be dropped (squelched) in the favor
of allocating resources to higher-priority connections (e.g., at
call setup request or protection switching times).  These multiple 
levels of protection/sharing (e.g., 1:1 dedicated, 1:1 shared, 
1:N shared, pre-emptable) will allow operators to define several 
differing classes (or grades) of service.  Further variations to the 
O-BPSR/2 framework are for future study.

Four-fiber optical path-switched rings (O-BPSR/4) have also been 
defined and can provide more advanced capabilities.  These rings also 
require a wavelength numbering plan, and it is best to choose one that 
mirrors the counterpart four-fiber OMS-SPRING scheme (and therefore,
conceptually parallel to four-fiber SONET ring time-slot assignments). 
Specifically, due to increased fiber resources, there is no need for 
intra-fiber wavelength partitioning, and therefore, two counter-
rotating fibers (i.e., all wavelengths) can be reserved for working 
and protection traffic, respectively.  Differing directions of a bi-
directional connection are therefore routed on different working fibers 
between the same ring nodes.  O-BPSR/4 protection schemes are largely
variations of 1:1 protection switching scheme, as illustrated for a 
single direction in Figure 8.  Furthermore, strong conceptual parallels 
exist with O-BLSR/4 line-switching concepts with regards to protection 
routing.  In the most straightforward case, ubiquitous far-side path 
switching can be implemented, with both paths (of a bi-directional 
circuit) being switched over on to their corresponding protection fiber 
routes on the opposite side of the ring (as per OCh-SPRING O-BPSR/2).  
Far-side path switching can protect against failure of all standby 
resources on the working side (i.e., complete multi-fiber ring 
conduit cut).

   Figure 8: Path protection schemes (O-BPSR/4), one-direction shown

Furthermore, four-fiber ring near-side protection switching concepts 
(Section 2.2.2) can also be applied on a path-level.  In fact, more 
variations are possible, namely edge-to-edge and intermediate near-side 
path switching.  The first, O-BPSR/4 edge-to-edge near-side path 
switching, routes both the working and protection lightpaths from the 
working fiber on to the protection fiber in the same direction, see 
Figure 8.  Meanwhile, to minimize the drop-rate of possible low-
priority connections using the protection wavelengths (and to an extent,
to also reduce signaling overheads), intermediate near-side path
switching can be considered.  This form of protection switching only 
performs partial working path re-routing, as illustrated for lightpath 
A-D in Figure 8, where the failed segment B-D is switched to the 
associated wavelength on the protection set of the second fiber.  This 
largely limits protection signaling to the two adjacent ring nodes, 
but cannot overcome node failures.  Due to the bi-directionality 
requirement, both channel directions are switched regardless of if one
or both failed.  For both forms of (O-BPSR/4) near-side switching, 
all-optical nodes will have to ensure that wavelength continuity 
considerations are met.  Note that O-BPSR/2/4 concepts can also be 
applied at the wavelength band level and this can be studied further.

Depending upon the optical ring node designs, protection resource 
sharing can also be achieved for four-fiber rings (and hence multi-
level service definitions).  For example, some have proposed a 
straightforward fiber protection implementation using 2x1 fiber 
switches before any mux/de-mux stages (Figure 1).  This implementation 
precludes complimentary wavelength-level processing capabilities (such 
as pass-through, add, drop), and hence will hinder wavelength sharing
on protection fibers (more restrictive).  Clearly, in order to share
wavelengths on the protection spans and improve resource utilization 
(i.e., for OMS/OCh-SPRING O-BLSR/4), per-wavelength processing is 
required for both working and protection fiber channels.  This 
essentially means that a fiber cut can also be handled by multiple 
channel-level re-routing actions, although implementation concerns can 
be more challenging.  Here, "batch" control commands (to switch 
multiple wavelengths) can be developed, since all wavelengths on a 
failed span are re-routed along a common route.  Furthermore, sharing 
protection resources will require larger add/drop or switching fabrics
(Figure 1).  Clearly, "full-blown" four-fiber rings can support many 
more users of any given service category, as compared to two-fiber 
ring schemes.

Ghani et. al.								[Page 15]

In general, operators may also want to provision multiple (ring) 
protection schemes off of the same fiber infrastructure.  In this 
regard, a generic limitation of fiber protection is that it treats all 
wavelengths (channels) in a fiber equally, and therefore alone it 
cannot achieve (channel-specific) service differentiation.  However, 
span protection can co-exist with channel protection if a priority 
mechanism is used to "arbitrate" between the two recovery mechanisms.
Various such mechanisms are conceivable, either signaling or non-
signaling based (for possible further study).  For two-fiber UPSR 
schemes (O-UPSR/2), span protection is not applicable for 1+1 channel
protection.  However, (signaled) bi-directional OMS/OCh-SPRING schemes 
(i.e., those using the O-BLSR/2 or O-BLSR/4 wavelength plans) can 
support both mechanisms, with idle protection spans carrying lower-
priority traffic.  As an example, co-existence between channel (O-BPSR)
and line (O-BLSR) protection mechanisms can be achieved in the 
protection signaling specification via an appropriate "priority" 
mechanism.  Typically, span protection should be done first since it 
represents "lower-level" (or more coarse) recovery.  This can be 
achieved by inhibiting all channel failure message responses and only 
responding to fiber/span failure messages.  Further details and 
intricacies are outside the current scope and require careful future
considerations.

2.3 Signaling Channel Architectures

Optical rings allow for significant latitude in signaling channel
architectures, and two overall categories are possible, namely in-band 
and out-band signaling.  In-band signaling requires the use of overhead 
framing bytes (as reserved in a SONET/SDH or OCh (digital wrapper) frame 
header) that are reserved on data channels.  Such mechanisms are best 
suited for O-E based optical node designs, where edge client signals 
are mapped into synchronized electronic frames that already contain 
the required signaling bytes.  Alternatively, out-band signaling can 
be used to more clearly decouple the data and control planes.  Out-band
signaling can be done using a dedicated control wavelength, commonly 
termed as the optical supervisory channel (OSC), or even via a 
physically separate, out-of-band network (such as an Ethernet LAN).  
Note that some have termed the OSC approach as in-band also, since 
the control wavelength (typically 1510 nm) "physically" resides in 
the fiber itself.  However, as far as data-control channel interaction 
is concerned, there is no interaction and hence this approach is termed 
as out-band.  Note that the OSC channel will require appropriate 
hardware support (filters, receivers, laser transmitters, etc).  
Recently efforts are beginning to emerge for defining a broad range 
of OSC standards, see [FREDETTE],[SZERENYI].

In general, an out-band OSC-based approach is more attractive to some 
since it allows for genuine service-transparent optical ring paradigms, 
also stated in [SOULLIERE].  Specifically, this approach utilizes the 
same fiber plant, precluding limitations with a completely external 
out-of-band signaling network, yet still permitting true client 
wavelength (payload) transparency.  However, out-band signaling systems 
need to ensure adequate bandwidth levels for increasingly large data 

Ghani et. al.								[Page 16]

wavelengths counts (in the hundreds).  As a result, further 
considerations are needed for the out-band OSC channel approach (see 
T1X1 generic proposal [SZERENYI]).  For example, some have proposed
using sub-rate (synchronous) TDM circuit streams to partition and
guarantee OSC bandwidth to all data wavelengths, typically for SONET/
SDH in-band signaling transport.  Others have proposed (asynchronous) 
packet signaling on the OSC channels.  In either case, whenever fast 
recovery guarantees are required, some form of bandwidth scheduling, be 
it TDM or packet scheduling (possibly with priority drop mechanisms), 
will likely be required on the OSC channels.  This introduces added, 
but necessary, complexity concerns.  Additionally, signaling channel 
robustness is also of concern and here, backup control channel 
provisions are also being considered, see [LANG],[FREDETTE].

2.4 Fault Detection and Isolation

The ability to quickly detect, and preferably localize, fault events 
is crucial to achieving fast service recovery.  So far, the above 
discussions have focused more upon switchover actions, and assume that 
fault detection (possibly localization) is already done.  Now a key 
differentiating aspect of optical networks, unlike SONET/SDH networks, 
is that more variations of fault detection and localization mechanisms
can be utilized (as will be detailed subsequently).  In order to allow 
for full flexibility, it is therefore preferable that network-level
optical (ring) fault recovery, notification, and detection/isolation
mechanisms be clearly separable and independent of each other (more
detailed discussion in Section 3.2.2).  A review of the various 
monitoring solutions is now presented, see also [CEUPPENS],[GHANI2],
[MANCHESTER1].

Many first-generation and even current-generation WDM systems simply 
re-use existing SONET/SDH schemes to detect and isolate channel faults 
inside the core optical (ring) network.  These solutions include re-
using B1 byte monitoring and loss of framing (LOF)/loss of signal 
(LOS) alarm information.  Such solutions have been commonly referred to 
as opto-electronic (O-E) and/or frame-monitoring schemes [GHANI2],
[CUEPPENS], since they require that all monitored data wavelengths be 
"opaque" or "translucent".  The digital wrappers approach, which 
represents a counterpart to SONET/SDH framing, also essentially embodies 
a similar O-E based solution, e.g., forward/reverse defect indicator 
(FDI/RDI) bytes, etc [G.709].  Since most operators are quite familiar 
with SONET/SDH overhead monitoring, O-E type schemes have one definite 
advantage, namely, well-defined standards.  This permits faster vendor 
interoperability (albeit not considering proprietary usages of various 
unused overhead bytes).  However, opaque monitoring represents some 
serious limitations.  First of all, per-channel electronic overheads 
usually pose increased systems costs and power requirements.  More 
importantly, such designs are largely unscalable to very large, ultra-
dense WDM systems, and generally inhibit evolutions to truly 
transparent networks [BHANDARI]. Furthermore, O-E monitoring requires 
mappings for all client payload types.  Now although well-defined
encapsulations exist for IP, ATM, and Frame Relay protocols, further 
extensions may be necessary, e.g., for new gigabit Ethernet standards, 
ESCON, cable video signals, etc.  Note however, that O-E monitoring 
may be suitable for monitoring out-band control channels, since these

Ghani et. al.								[Page 17]

are electrically terminated at each node.

To get around the limitations of opaque monitoring, various vendors 
have proposed optical monitoring schemes using non-intrusive signal 
tapping setups.  These solutions are particularly germane to monitoring
non-SONET/SDH payload types, and analyze such parameters as fiber/
wavelength (optical signal) power levels, optical signal-to-noise ratios 
(O-SNR), Q-factors, etc (see [GHANI2],[CUEPPENS]).  For example, power
monitoring can detect fiber cuts in under 10 ms, and this is capable of 
meeting the most stringent of recovery requirements.  Power monitoring 
is also termed as loss of signal (LOS)/loss of light (LOL) fault, and 
can trigger various protection actions, such as 1+1 receiver switchovers 
or fault/alarm messaging.  However, although optical monitoring is of 
high interest to vendors and service providers alike, the current lack 
of standards (and to an extent, advanced features) is hindering its 
widescale adoption.  Most current all-optical solutions simply perform 
line power-level monitoring, and are therefore best-suited for O-BLSR 
support.  Although per-wavelength power-level monitoring can also be 
done, this approach is not cost-effective at all for large channel 
counts (i.e., hundreds of wavelengths, as per DWDM).  Nevertheless, 
such per-wavelength monitoring capabilities inside the network core 
will be needed in order to support transparent O-BPSR schemes, in the 
absence of any O-E (SONET) frame monitoring.  Although optical 
monitoring resources (such as spectrum scanners) can be shared between 
multiple fibers/wavelengths to control costs, the resulting fault 
detection times will be much longer.  Further adding in transient 
switching times (milliseconds range), achieving the "50 ms" SONET/SDH 
recovery time ceiling may prove difficult.  Regardless, since optical 
component technologies are continually undergoing rapid improvements and
miniaturization, it remains to be seen if these concerns, indeed, may be
mitigated in the foreseeable future.  Moreover, some network designers 
may actually want to use optical monitoring techniques to complement 
capabilities in opaque networks, e.g., observe transponder performance/
behaviors to predict failure conditions.

A more timely and cost-effective alternative may be to perform "edge" 
channel (OCh) fault isolation, as suggested in [BHANDARI].  Specifically, 
no channel-level monitoring is performed inside the network (between
the edge points), thereby precluding excessive (expensive) O-E 
conversions or OCh-level optical monitoring.  Instead, fault isolation is
only done at the channel edge points.  This can be achieved using a 
variety of techniques, implemented in the appropriate receiver/interface 
cards (either optical power monitoring or electronic frame monitoring 
after O-E conversion).  All that is required is that the channel 
protection sub-path be "dis-joint" (Section 3.1.2) from the working 
paths.  This approach is very attractive in all-optical networks (both 
ring and mesh), where operators request service transparency with 
"SONET-like" recovery times.  Also, this solution is well-suited for 
"edge-to-edge" channel protection schemes, such as those detailed for 
O-UPSR/2 or O-BPSR (far-side, edge-to-edge near-side) setups.  Note here
that the "edge" regions can either comprise single rings (i.e., SNC 
portion) or a series of rings (or hybrid ring-meshes), forming a larger 
(optical) sub-domain (also see discussions in Section 3.3.1).

Ghani et. al.								[Page 18]

3. Dynamic Provisioning Issues

Recent developments have extended the MPLS protocol framework from the 
packet/flow switching domain to the optical lightpath switching domain.  
Termed multi-protocol lambda switching, MPL(ambda)S [AWDUCHE],[GHANI1],
[RAJAGOPALAN], this work draws analogies between labels and wavelengths
and intends to re-use/extend signaling and resource discovery protocols 
for the optical domain.  Optical nodes (such as cross-connects or 
add-drop multiplexers) use IP addressing schemes and run extended MPLS 
routing and generalized signaling protocols, i.e., lambda switch routers.  
More importantly, recent proposals for a generalized MPLS (GMPLS) 
[ASHWOOD1] framework are furthering this trend, extending basic MPLS
concepts to provision more generalized label switched path (G-LSP) 
entities, e.g., TDM circuits via SONET ADM's, lightpaths via wavelength 
cross-connects, etc.  In parallel, there has been a lot of focus on 
defining LSP recovery schemes for MPLS networks, albeit, mostly at the 
packet flow level [DOVOLSKY],[OWENS1],[KINI2].  Possibly, these schemes
can also be investigated for their potential applicability to "optical 
LSP" (i.e., lightpath) protection.   However, in general, due to the 
IP-centric origins of the MPLS framework, the above work is generally 
tailored for mesh (optical) networks, even though its generic nature 
does not preclude specialized, topology-specific applications or 
extensions.

Given all the variations of optical rings (Section 2), it is very 
advantageous to develop a comprehensive provisioning framework and align 
it with the larger MPL(ambda)S/GMPLS architecture.  In particular, two 
signaling mechanisms are required for optical rings:

- First, signaling is required for dynamic ring configuration and 
  lightpath provisioning operations, such as setup/takedown.  These 
  mechanisms must specify both the working and protection entities of the
  lightpaths and incorporate all of the intricacies of (ring) protection 
  switching mechanisms.  Ring resource management will also be a critical 
  part of the provisioning stage.  

- Second, a signaling mechanism is required to perform the automatic 
  protection switching (APS) actions, as determined by related ring 
  protection schemes, Section 2.

An initial look at these two crucial topics is now presented and is 
intended to serve as basis for further, more defining work.

3.1 Channel Setup Requirements

>From an operator's point of view, ring networks will likely interface to 
(or even migrate into) mesh networks in the near future (e.g., metro 
rings to regional/long-haul mesh).  Given the likely adoption of
MPL(ambda)S/GMPLS type protocols for optical mesh provisioning, it is 
prudent to choose likewise for ring networks, thereby enabling an even 
closer interworking.  For optical ring channel setup/takedown, the 
overall provisioning capabilities developed under the ubiquitous 
MPL(ambda)S/GMPLS frameworks are quite applicable.  Namely extensions to 
MPLS signaling protocols are already being proposed to handle the 
specifics of optical lightpath routing [ASHWOOD2-3],[KOMPELLA1-3],[YU].
However, provisioning ring lightpaths (working, protection) will require 

Ghani et. al.								[Page 19]

added considerations, and some of these are now considered more closely.

3.1.1 Signaling Extensions

At the core of ring channel provisioning is the concept of a service 
definition, as commonly extended through various means, e.g., either
from a element/network management system (EMS/NMS) or via an "optical 
user network interface" (O-UNI).  Since the latter approach has been 
the focus of many standardization efforts, discussions herein will
give it closer consideration.  Recently, many "O-UNI" definitions have 
been tabled for optical networks, proposing various new "signaled" 
interfaces [ARVIND],[ABOULMAGD],[MCADAMS],[XUE] along with expanded
features in the MPLS LSP setup messaging [YU],[KOMPELLA3].  In short, 
service definitions supply the signaled information "attributes" for 
subsequent channel setups.  Channel setup, in turn, implies the more 
general category of routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) and policy 
control (Section 3.1.3).  Setup information usually includes many 
details, such as the channel framing type (e.g., SONET/SDH, digital
wrappers, IEEE Ethernet, etc), bit-rate (2.5 Gb/s OC-48/STM-16, 10 Gb/s 
OC-192/STM-64, 1.0 Gb/s 10 Gb/s Ethernet, etc), protection type (shared, 
dedicated, enhanced, unprotected), and priority (non-pre-emptable, 
pre-emptable), etc, see [ABOULMAGD],[ASHWOOD1].  Provisions have also 
been suggested for indicating lightpath diversity levels (e.g., node, 
link, etc), see [XUE],[ABOULMAGD].  By and large, these generic 
attributes also apply to ring networks, although their detailed usages 
and applications require further considerations.  

The above-mentioned service definition "attributes" need to be "mapped" 
into appropriate signaling messages in order to setup the lightpath 
channels (e.g., as per RSVP-TE, CR-LDP signaling [ASHWOOD2-3],
[KOMPELLA3]).  Here, a key step in this mapping will be to first 
translate the desired (requested) user lighpath attributes into 
appropriate ring channel request types, i.e., as per the various types 
of optical rings (Section 2).  Specifically, users may request various 
channel priority or protection types (amongst other attributes), and 
these must be translated to the appropriate channel types given the 
underlying ring specifics.  For example, a user request for a non-pre-
emptable, non-shared protected channel in a O-UPSR/2 (two-fiber) setup 
may be translated into a simple 1+1 working/protection channel request.
Alternatively, the same request in a O-BPSR/4 (four-fiber) setup may be 
resolved as a 1:1 working/protection channel request.  Such mappings 
are required before any ligthpath routing can be performed (Section 
3.1.3).  Overall, the mapping of (signaled) channel attributes from 
user requests to the exact ring lightpath types is very implementation-
specific and hence should not be the subject of standardization (i.e., 
vendor-value add feature).

Once the user request is properly mapped (on to the ring) and its
lightpath route computed (Section 3.1.3), various MPLS LSP signaling 
capabilities can be exploited for the actual setup [ASHWOOD2-3].  
Clearly, one such feature is explicit route (ER) signaling, which can 
explicitly indicate the required path and reserve resources.  

Ghani et. al.								[Page 20]

Specifically, ER inserts the complete route specification in appropriate 
route specification objects (i.e., explicit route fields in RSVP-TE PATH 
or CR-LDP LABEL_REQUEST messages).  Additionally, bi-directional channel 
setup provisions have also been considered [ASHWOOD2-3],[GUO1], helping 
ensure that both uni-directional lightpaths of a bi-directional LSP/G-LSP
traverse the same set of nodes.  In conjunction with shared risk link 
group (SRLG) "disjointness" information (Section 3.1.2), this signaling 
feature is directly applicable to O-BLSR/2/4 and O-BPSR/2/4 setups (i.e., 
where bi-directional channels must traverse the same set of ring nodes).  
Sample proposals for lightpath setup signaling using appropriately 
defined TLV objects are presented in [KOMPELLA3],[YU] and the additional 
related references therein.  Any extensions to the setup signaling 
message (object) types for ring channel provisioning need further study.  

3.1.2 Resource and State Dissemination

In addition to the above setup information requirements, provisioning 
algorithms (Section 3.1.3) need to know the existing static topological 
details and available dynamic resource levels (as detailed in [CHIU],
[BERNSTEIN]) in order to compute ring routes.  Consider the first 
requirement.  Examples of basic static topological information are the 
number of fibers, ring nodes, and their connectivity.  For fiber 
elements, information is required to indicate the link type 
(transparent, service-aware), the number and location of supported 
wavelength channels (e.g., ITU-T grid spacing, offsets, guard bands), 
related analog metrics (loss, dispersion figures), etc.  Meanwhile, 
for ring node elements, many (static) details are pertinent.  Examples 
include the ring configuration type (O-UPSR, O-BLSR, O-BPSR, or 
multiple), number of fiber ports (e.g., incoming, outgoing, add, drops), 
fiber port protection type (1+1 protected or unprotected), type of 
ports supported (e.g., transparent, opaque), performance monitoring 
capabilities (e.g., optical, electrical, per-channel, per-span), signal 
regeneration (e.g., 1R, 2R, 3R), wavelength conversion capabilities 
(e.g., none, partial/selected, full), protection switching capabilities 
(e.g., per-channel, per-fiber, per-conduit), etc.  Since ring schemes 
are intricately associated with the directionality and protection 
association (working, protection) of fibers or wavelength groups 
inside fibers, this information must also be incorporated.

In traditional data networks, interior gateway protocols (IGP) are used 
to disseminate static topology and dynamic resource information.  
Recent additions for supporting opaque link state attribute (LSA) 
definitions (RFC 2370) will help further facilitate extensions to 
"non-data" routing applications.  More recently, many proposals have 
tabled extensions thereof for optical networks, and in fact, many of 
the above-discussed requirements (for static topology and dynamic 
resource information) have already been proposed within the context of
mesh-routing MPL(ambda)S/GMPLS networks [KOMPELLA1-3].  For example, IGP 
provisions have been considered to indicate wavelength conversion 
capabilities and dynamic link-level resource (wavelength) utilizations/
levels.  Such active resource updates are vital for dynamic ring 
RWA algorithms.  Delineations between different link-level resource 
classes have also been proposed (i.e., active, free, reserved, pre-
emptable wavelength sets), see [KINI1-2].  The actual control/
specification of wavelength plans can be done either statically (via

Ghani et. al.								[Page 21]

the NMS) or dynamically (e.g., based upon changing network topologies).
As an application here, such resource class delineations can be 
leveraged to control intra-fiber wavelength plans (e.g., per O-BLSR/2, 
O-BPSR/2 schemes).

In addition, recently the concept of a shared risk link group (SRLG)
definition has also been proposed to help identify risk associations 
between various entities, see [RAJAGOPALAN],[PAPADIMITRIOU1].  By using
this information, adequate resource "disjointness" can be introduced
into the constraint-based path computation (routing, Section 3.1.3)
phase, thereby reducing simultaneous lightpath failures (e.g., between
working and protection paths).  Recently, a detailed, comprehensive 
treatment of the SRLG concept has been presented in [PAPADIMITRIOU1],
in order to formalize the link between risk groups and route computation.  
Here, two different hierarchical resource inference/diversity models 
are defined, namely physical (e.g., wavelength, fiber, conduit, etc) 
and logical (or geographical, i.e., node, zone, region).  An encoding 
scheme is also presented for encoding/summarizing SRLG identifiers 
(e.g., between logical boundaries) along with possible mechanisms for 
risk assignment.  Collectively, SRLG information and the associated 
lightpath risk derivation mechanisms are crucial for service 
provisioning in optical networks, given the high levels of traffic 
multiplexing and also resource co-location (e.g., wavelengths in 
fibers, fibers in conduits, etc), see also Section 3.1.3.

Overall, many of the above-described informational (IGP) extensions are
also very applicable to optical ring networks.  As these concepts mature, 
along with their usage definitions, their application herein will indeed 
be highly practical.  Additional specifications or applications of such
augmented LSA's are for future study.

3.1.3 Constraint-Based Routing/Path Computation

During the channel (i.e., LSP/G-LSP) setup phase, lightpath route 
computation is performed by utilizing the available network 
information (e.g., topology, ring-type, resource levels, risk groups, 
etc).  Specifically constrained routing/path computation is required, 
and this can be deemed as a subset of the more generic constraint-based 
routing paradigm [GHANI1].  Here, the constraints are now more specific 
to optical parameters (e.g., topologies, wavelengths, converters, 
amplifiers, etc) and policies (e.g., as per SLA requirements).  As an 
aside, generic policy control (management issue) can also be implemented 
(in addition to the compute-centric RWA processes) in order to enforce 
user SLA guidelines.  A sample application using the well-defined, 
generic common open policy service protocol (COPS RFC 2748) is presented
in [GHANI3].  

To date, much detailed research has been done on the subject of 
constraint-based lightpath routing, technically termed as the routing
and wavelength assignment (RWA) [ZANG] and/or virtual topology design 
[DUTTA] problem.  In performing lightpath channel routing, typically, 
there are two sub-problems which have to be resolved, namely lightpath 
route computation and subsequent wavelength selection [DUTTA].  Overall, 

Ghani et. al.								[Page 22]

many types of RWA algorithms have been proposed in the literature, 
ranging from complex optimization-type formulations, to constrained 
shortest-path methods, to various simplified heuristics.  Usually, RWA 
algorithms aim to optimize specific objectives, subject to various broad 
constraints such as hop counts, wavelength re-use (in given network 
segments), propagation delays, protection/priority levels, residual 
resources, revenues, risk probabilities, etc.  The objectives could either 
be resource oriented, namely high resource efficiency, or performance 
oriented, such as low blocking probability, etc.  Moreover, many ring-
specific lightpath routing algorithms have also been researched, see 
[MARCENAC] and related references.  Clearly, any ring lightpath RWA 
algorithms will be very tightly coupled with the actual ring types (uni-
directional, bi-directional), wavelength plans, wavelength conversion 
capabilities, and various other specific considerations.  For example, 
in O-UPSR/2 rings for a 1+1 protected channel request, two "disjoint" 
paths must be found between the source and destination nodes, along with 
necessary permanent bridging/receiving resources at the endpoints.  
Alternatively, in O-BLSR/4 rings for a 1:1 shared long-side protected 
channel request, the RWA schemes will only need to search the long-side 
of the ring for protection channel routes, and this can include any 
assigned protection wavelengths.  Note that the actual computation phase 
can be implemented in a variety of ways, such as distributed shortest-
path/heuristic computations (e.g., specific renditions of Dijkstra 
algorithms) or via centralized route/policy control servers. 

Note that for (ring) protection schemes, further RWA considerations are 
required.  Specifically, at setup time "joint" RWA algorithms are
necessary for resolving the routes and associated wavelengths for both 
the working and protection (sub)paths, see [DOSHI] for sample proposal.  
These computations can (should) further utilize SRLG-based information to 
ensure adequate resource/risk diversity between working and protection 
channels, see [PAPDIMITRIOU1] Appendix.  For example, (ring) protection 
paths require shared-resource (i.e., risk) separation from working 
entities, i.e., "disjoint".  In this context, an entity can be a full 
edge-to-edge lightpath (as per O-BPSR/2/4 near/far-side and O-UPSR/2), 
a portion of a lightpath (i.e., sub-path as per O-BPSR/4 intermediate 
near-side), or a complete fiber span (as per O-BLSR/2/4).  Moreover, 
SRLG definitions can be used to effect inter-fiber delineation between 
working and protection fibers (for the case of O-UPSR/2 and O-BLSR/4 
rings), i.e., working and protection SRLG identifiers.  Generic 
discussion of routing diversity (dis-jointness) is also presented in 
[DOVOLSKY],[OWENS2],[XUE].  

Overall, it is highly likely that the lightpath routing algorithms 
themselves will not be the subject of standardization.  Conversely, this
is certainly an area of vendor-value add, and many suppliers will prefer
implementing their own proprietary algorithms/policy control as best
suited to their individual customer needs.  Therefore, what needs to be
standardized is more the actual informational framework required to 
perform proper lightpath RWA computation.

3.2 Protection Signaling

It is safe to assume that operators will demand SONET/SDH-type recovery 

Ghani et. al.								[Page 23]

timescales for protected optical ring services (i.e., 50 ms ceiling), and 
meeting this stringent requirement is perhaps the foremost concern when 
trying to apply the MPL(ambda)S/GMPLS framework to optical ring control 
[GHANI2].  Now for most optical ring types (excluding 1+1 uni-directional 
O-UPSR/2 designs), millisecond recovery requires fast "APS-like" 
signaling capabilities, akin to the SONET/SDH K1/K2-byte APS protocol.  
Generally speaking, all such schemes can be subsumed under a more 
encompassing model, namely that of two (or more) switching end-point 
nodes and intermediate, physically disjoint protection resource(s). 
(This excludes loop-back switching techniques, which are largely deemed 
unfavorable for optical networks, Section 2.2.2).  For example, for 
channel protection, the end-point nodes are either the source and 
destination nodes (O-BPSR/2, edge-to-edge near-side and far-side 
O-BPSR/4), or the appropriate intermediate nodes (intermediate near-side 
O-BPSR/4).  Likewise, for span protection, the end-point nodes are simply 
the adjacent optical ring nodes.  By developing appropriate switchover 
signaling capabilities to implement this generic model, conceivably most 
relevant ring protection schemes can be covered.

For the special case of optical ring networks, two possible options 
exist for implementing such fast protection switching.  One is to 
develop enhancements to the existing RSVP-TE/CR-LDP LSP protection 
(survivability) signaling proposals and tailor them for "optical 
lightpath LSP" protection, termed herein as the direct interworking 
approach (originally proposed in [GHANI2]).  The other would be to 
develop an altogether new, dedicated protection-switching protocol, 
namely an optical APS (O-APS) protocol, to complement the overall 
MPL(ambda)S/GMPLS framework.  This new protocol would only perform 
protection switchover signaling for fault events but not any setup 
provisioning (relegated to existing setup signaling mechanisms, 
as detailed previously in Section 3.1).  These two cases are presented 
in a broader context in Figure 9, which shows an example of multi-level 
recovery protocols.  On the packet routing level, service recovery 
actions can be performed by existing IGP path re-computation/re-routing 
schemes (longer convergence times).  On the virtual circuit (i.e., packet
LSP) level, emerging enhancements to RSVP-TE/CR-LDP signaling can effect 
improved recovery timescales (sub-second or lower).  Finally, on the 
lightpath circuit level, recovery actions can be implemented either via 
further RSVP-TE/CR-LDP enhancements or an (above-mentioned) O-APS 
protocol, Figure 9.  Further details are now discussed.

3.2.1 Direct Interworking

It is instructive to first briefly review MPLS LSP protection concepts. 
Clearly, simple non-signaled protection is possible by establishing

Ghani et. al.								[Page 24]

multiple (LSP) paths between source and destination LSR nodes and 
streaming data across these paths, essentially like 1+1 ("make-before-
break") protection.  However, more advanced protection signaling 
proposals are also beginning to emerge within the extended RSVP-TE and 
CR-LDP protocols framework [BHANDARI],[HUANG],[KINI1-2],[OWENS1-3].  
The basic idea with MPLS LSP protection is to provision back LSP 
(sub)-paths, and in case of fault discovery, perform a signaled 
switchover.  Generic protection switch LSR (PSL) and protection merge 
LSR (PML) nodes are defined and these entities define the edges of the 
protected LSP segments.  Specifically, a desired LSP segment, termed 
working (or active) path [OWENS1], is setup for protection by having 
the PML/PSL nodes source and sink two distinct (sub)-paths, working and 
protection, as shown in Figure 10.  As a generalization, PSL/PML node 
pairs can protect multiple LSP segments, termed protected MPLS traffic 
group (PMTG) [OWENS1], reducing signaling overheads for improved 
scalability.  Downstream nodes detecting a fault event propagate a 
failure indication signal (FIS) in the upstream direction, containing 
a list of protected LSP's on the failed PMTG entity.  Various timer 
mechanisms are used to control the inter-FIS packet timing, duration of
FIS transmissions, and hold-off time for initial FIS indication, see 
[OWENS1] for discussions on timer settings.  Upon receiving the FIS 
message, the PML node performs a switchover from the working to 
protection sub-paths for all affected LSP's specified in the PMTG. 
Additionally, a failure recovery signal (FRS) is also propagated after 
the fault has been repaired (along the same route as the FIS message).  
Similar timer mechanisms as with the FIS message also exist for the FRS
message, and neither message type requires reliable transport, e.g., no 
TCP connection.  Note that both the FIS and FRS message types are 
"protection-related" additions to the MPLS signaling framework (CR-LDP, 
RSVP).  Owing to the generic nature of this specification, the PML and 
PSL nodes need not be the "end-point" source and destination nodes, 
respectively, and hence technically speaking, judicious placement 
thereof allows this framework to incorporate path, sub-path, and hop 
protection schemes.  Although this overall framework seems most 
applicable to 1:1 or 1:N protection schemes (downstream nodes signal
fault switchover requests to upstream nodes), a 1+1 protection type
is also mentioned in [OWENS3].  Finally, proposals for sharing 
protection resources between multiple protection paths (and lower-
priority traffic) are also beginning to emerge [BHANDARI],[GHANI1],
[KINI2].

     Figure 10: MPLS LSP protection concept (PSL/PML LSR nodes)

A paramount concern for network operators is fast recovery times.  The 
MPLS LSP protection proposals are increasingly aware of this need, 
especially in comparison with the relatively longer timescales of IP 
re-routing schemes.  Along these lines, the MPLS LSP protection 
framework includes the concept of a reverse notification tree (RNT) 
[OWENS1-2] entity that traverses from the PSL to the PML node.  This
provides an "express" signaling path for protection and recovery 
messages, significantly more efficient that "flooding-type" recovery 
schemes.  The RNT is basically an "inverse" label-lookup (cross-connect) 
table that is constructed at the time of working/protection LSP setup 
and allows for resolving the incoming links on which to forward the 
backwards-propagating FIS message.  As such, this construct implements
"near-side" protection signaling.  By using the RNT, hop-by-hop routing 
of FIS messages can be avoided, helping to expedite switchover times.  
In the latest specification, hop-by-hop routing (layer 3), packet LSP 
(MPLS), or SONET K1/K2 bytes (layer 2) mechanisms can be used to 
implement the RNT (see [OWENS1]).  Also note that the RNT concept 
extends to multicast LSP's and is implemented for both working and 
protected paths.  The latter allows it to be used to indicate failures 
on the protection path (requiring subsequent manual operator 
intervention, however).  The actual setup of protection segment is
implemented via extensions to the ER field of CR-LDP and RSVP-TE setup 
messages, e.g., LABEL_REQ, PATH [HUANG],[OWENS3].  Specifically, 
attributes are added for identifying the PSL/PML pair, protection 
type (1:1, 1+1) RNT implementation, timer values, etc.  Note that 
there have also been related proposals for augmenting IGP protocols to 
support LSP protection (e.g., delineate active/back bandwidths), see 
[KINI1].  These can be extended to the optical case to specify active/
backup wavelength sets, etc. 

Now consider the application of the above MPLS "packet LSP" protection 
framework within the context of protection switching in optical (ring) 
networks.  For the case of channel (OCh) protection, the optical (O-ADM, 
OXC) LSR devices can now serve as PML and PSL nodes and "disjoint" 
protection lightpaths (or hops) can be specified between the two nodes, 
as per [GHANI2].  The PMTG entity at this level is the lightpath channel.
For example, for edge-to-edge channel protection (e.g., O-BPSR/2, 
O-BPSR/4), the PSL/PML nodes can be the (sub)connection end-points 
themselves. Alternatively, for intermediate near-side channel protection 
(O-BLSR/4 case only), the PSL/PML pair can be the appropriate 
intermediate ring nodes.  Given the appropriate information (via 
requirements specified in Section 3.1.2), RWA algorithms can 
appropriately setup the ring working/protection routes and switching 
points by using the ER signaling function.  Note, further, that the PMTG 
concept can be used to group "lambdas" and define appropriate class of 
service (CoS) for the optical domain (i.e., from the service protection 
perspective).


Ghani et. al.								[Page 26]

The case of line protection, as proposed in O-BLSR/2/4 schemes, is 
somewhat different, since spans are more static (physical) entities and 
not dynamically created ones, as are lightpaths.  However, using the 
protection group concept, all wavelengths on a given fiber span can be 
grouped into a common "span" PMTG and the diverse PMTG "span" route 
established.  This route can either be a single span (O-BLSR/4) or a 
series of spans (O-BLSR/2 with loop-back), with the two adjacent nodes 
serving as the PML/PSL pair.  Note that depending upon the span-
switching implementation, wavelength switching may not be required.  
More clearly, O-BLSR/4 schemes using simple 2x1 switches for fiber 
protection do not permit wavelength re-use on protection fibers.  In 
this case, a FIS message (pertaining to a fiber cut) will simply 
trigger a 2x1 span switch.  However, simpler O-BLSR/2 schemes and 
more elaborate O-BLSR/4 schemes (e.g., without 2x1 span switches) 
can carry lower-priority traffic on protection wavelengths.  In 
these cases, all individual channels of a PMTG have to be switched.

Although the above high-level interworking seems amenable, there are 
some concerns regarding recovery timing, particularly with regards to 
RNT setups and fault signaling.  Consider the RNT issue first.  During 
MPLS LSP setup, LSR nodes must keep track of the upstream node, 
incoming link and interface, and list of LSP(s) (unicast case) in order
to construct the RNT.  The procedure assumes bi-directional links 
between intermediate LSR nodes, since FIS messages are subsequently 
transmitted on the "reverse-table" incoming link interface.  This 
implies an "inband" signaling setup.  However, in optical rings (even 
meshes), especially transparent rings (meshes), there is likely a much 
higher degree of orthogonality between control and data flows.  For 
example, if control signaling is done on out-band OSC channels and 
not "embedded" in data wavelengths, even though RNT setups can extract 
the above-detailed state at channel setup time, the actual FIS (and 
FRS) messages are not sent on the "reverse-lookup" incoming interface 
links.  Additionally, the current MPLS RNT setup performs near-side 
protection signaling, since fault messaging traverses the same set of 
nodes but in the opposite direction.  For long-side protection 
signaling (as required per some O-BLSR/O-BPSR designs, Section 2.2), 
however, protection signaling is required on the RNT of the protection 
path.  This is slightly different from the existing possibility of MPLS
protection-path RNT signaling [OWENS1], since it implies failure of the 
working and not protection side.  All of these intricacies will require 
further setup signaling considerations.

Now consider the MPLS fault signaling message types, namely FIS and 
FRS and their usage for optical channel protection.  Initially, the 
various fault detection (isolation) schemes, Section 2.4, are expected 
to trigger FIS message transmissions within a few milliseconds of an 
occurring fault (note that associated FIS hold-off timers must set 
appropriately).  Once the FIS messages are generated, the remaining 
recovery latency is largely controlled by MPLS-layer signaling 
protocols and ensuing optical switchover times.  The latter issue 
depends upon the actual switching technology used in the ring node's 
protection stage, Figure 1, and realistically, millisecond timeframes 
can be expected via solutions such as MEMS or (O-E based) EXC designs.
Meanwhile, this stresses the need for expedient FIS processing in order 
to match stringent benchmarks set by SONET/SDH APS.  Here, the RNT 
architecture is of particular importance (as detailed above).  It is 

Ghani et. al.								[Page 27]

expected that high-priority MPLS packet LSP's (routed on the OSC) will 
be required to expedite fault message transmissions along the reverse
path.  Specifically, improvements can be achieved using a variety 
of solutions.  One is to use priority queuing for (reverse) FIS 
messages, and dedicate a fixed minimum amount of bandwidth via some
scheduler mechanisms.  A further extension would be to perform 
FIS message processing (e.g., RNT label lookups and fast switchover) 
via dedicated hardware, such as FPGA devices.  Clearly, both of 
these schemes entail added system complexity, and demonstrable 
evidence is required to determine if SONET/SDH recovery times can be 
effectively matched.  Otherwise, the advantage of fast protection
switching yielded by ring networks cannot be realized.

Another important issue arises with regards to "operational modes." 
Specifically, the emerging MPLS protection signaling framework still 
lacks some of the vital, "externally-initiated" [GR1230] features which 
SONET operators are well-accustomed to.  Namely, the SONET K1/K2 byte 
protocol enables multiple operating "modes" via a well-defined message 
priority structure.  For example, messages are defined (in decreasing 
order of priority) for lockout, forced switching, fault events (signal 
fail, signal degrade), and manual switching, see [GR1230].  Such 
procedures are vital to operations-related tasks and are used during 
various phases (i.e., maintenance, diagnostics, and upgrades).  
Controlling the "operating mode" is instrumental in avoiding excessive 
service disruptions to live customer traffic.  Undoubtedly, similar 
functions must eventually be provided by MPL(ambda)S/GMPLS-based optical 
signaling protocols, in both ring and mesh networks, if optical channel 
services are to be deployed in carrier-class networks.  This area has 
not received much attention to date and significant further work will
be required.  Provisioning such operating modes will require additional 
message types to be added to RSVP-TE and CR-LDP messaging, e.g., a 
forced or manual switching message type, etc.  In summary, there are
clearly a number of issues that need to be resolved before MPLS LSP
protection schemes can be confidently applied to optical ring networks.

3.2.2 O-APS Protocol

As an alternative to generalizing MPLS LSP protection capabilities, a 
specialized, fast optical APS (O-APS) protocol is possible for optical
rings.  This entity can be considered as an orthogonal addition to the
MPL(ambda)S/GMPLS protocols suite to achieve fast protection signaling, 
see Figure 9.  For some, there are various compelling reasons to develop 
such an alternative.  First of all, given the relatively stringent 
recovery requirements, many may argue that modifying or specializing 
MPLS signaling protocols (e.g., added failure-recovery messages, 
prioritized processing/implementations) may become too complicated 
and lengthy a process.  Instead, a lightweight O-APS protocol can be 
designed, and this would be functionally equivalent to an "optical" 
version of the ubiquitous SONET K1/K2 byte protocol. Nevertheless, 
unlike the SONET K1/K2 byte APS protocol [GR1230] the O-APS protocol 
should be defined as "fast" packet-based protocol, in order to keep it
in-line with the packet-oriented control philosophy of MPLS networks. 

Ghani et. al.								[Page 28]

How the O-APS protocol's packet messages are actually transported on 
control channels, however, can be left open to vendor implementation, 
but likely, bandwidth guarantees will be necessary in order to meet 
recovery timing requirements (similar to discussions for FIS message 
transport, Section 3.2.1).  For example, some vendors may choose to 
explicitly map the message bytes into appropriate inband overhead 
bytes (e.g., SONET/SDH or digital wrappers bytes).  Note that this 
case is somewhat different from that of standardizing explicit 
signaling bytes, i.e., "non-packetized" O-APS protocol.  However,
since protection timing is such a critical issue, some guidelines
will likely be required to ensure satisfactory performance across 
larger networks (consisting of multi-vendor equipment).  Such 
guidelines are for further study and can include guard-band times for
message processing, etc.

Some of the key components of an O-APS protocol are briefly highlighted 
here, although a more detailed specification is clearly beyond the 
scope of this discussion and intended for further study.  Among other 
things, message fields must identify the switching nodes, lightpath 
channels/spans, fault type (channel, span, node), and requested 
protection actions (channel or span switching, near-side, far-side), 
etc.  Additional parameters must also be specified for alarm messaging,
such as durations, spacings, even priorities (e.g., span, channel).  
A complete state machine definition and related rules are also required, 
and examples include triggering recovery actions, starting/stopping 
alarm messaging, alarm squelching for multiple types of alarms (e.g., 
channel versus span, etc).  Another issue is inter-node keepalive 
messaging.  Such "hello" message formats are common in IGP protocols 
and are directly embedded into the SONET APS protocol, i.e., non-alarm 
K1/K2 byte fields serve as constant "hello" updates.  O-APS peer nodes 
must also have this capability, and one alternative is to add explicit 
hello messaging for non-failure time periods.  Note that the LMP
protocol also has some provisions for "liveness" message updates, but
this protocol is currently more geared towards mesh network support,
i.e., OXC-to-OXC or router-to-OXC connectivity maintenance with likely
longer inter-message periods, see [LANG],[FREDETTE].  (Nevertheless, 
new WDM-related provisions are being considered for LMP, and their 
applicability within the O-APS context is discussed later).  Hence a 
fast, dedicated liveness/hello mechanism (and fast detection mechanism)
is desirable for optical rings.  Finally, since the O-APS protocol will 
be "new" protocol, it presents a good opportunity to properly define 
crucial "operator-initiated" functionalities, Section 3.2.1.  For 
example, explicit message types (or fields, as appropriate) and 
appropriate priorities can be assigned for features such as resource 
lockout, forced and/or manual protection switching, etc.  In fact, this 
option is one clear advantage of defining an altogether new protection 
O-APS switching protocol.  However, significant further work is required 
to specify a truly generalized O-APS framework to implement the 
previously-defined transparent optical ring architectures, Section 2.
Overall, an O-APS function will be an orthogonal, complimentary addition
to the MPL(ambda)S/GMPLS suite.

Note that from a broader perspective, a dedicated O-APS protocol can 
also be deployed in a "standalone" manner, an added benefit.  This is 

Ghani et. al.								[Page 29]

important for many vendors who need to provide optical ring solutions, 
but at the same time, want to gradually transition into a full-blown 
"MPLS-based" control frameworks.  In such cases, the orthogonal nature 
of the O-APS protocol will allow vendors to either couple its 
protection switching features with their own (proprietary) NMS-based
provisioning solutions, or with their MPL(ambda)S/GMPLS-based control 
framework.  In the former case, an NMS controller(s) will explicitly 
setup and takedown ring channel lightpaths and "fill in" the required 
information for the O-APS protocols to operate from, e.g., such as 
ring maps, etc.  However, future migrations towards truly open, 
distributed provisioning paradigms (i.e., in lieu of proprietary 
NMS-based provisioning setups) will clearly necessitate added 
interworkings between the O-APS protocol and the other (orthogonal)
MPL(ambda)S/GMPLS components.  In particular, proper interfaces have 
to be identified (and developed) to enable any information exchange.
Although the details of such interworkings are for further study, 
some preliminary possibilities can be highlighted here.

At channel setup time, the O-APS protocol may require various pieces of
information from the related setup signaling entities (CR-LDP or RSVP-TE, 
Section 3.1) in order to perform its functions, i.e., since the O-APS 
protocol itself does not implement any channel provisioning 
functionalities.  As a particular example, "connection ring map" 
information must be supplied after the appropriate signaling procedures 
have setup the associated lightpath channels, identifying the source and 
destination endpoints of the lighpath connection.  Additional information 
will likely be required from the lighpath routing engine which computes 
details of the working/protection routes, e.g., protection types (e.g., 
channel, span), switching endpoints (source/destination or intermediate 
node pairs), etc.  For example, the source/destination ring nodes are 
the switching end-points for edge-to-edge long/near-side channel 
protection (as per O-UPSR and O-BPSR designs), whereas the selected 
intermediate nodes are the end-points for near-side intermediate 
channel switching (as per some O-BPSR/4 designs).  Alternatively, for 
span protection, the end-points are the two nodes adjacent to the 
failure.  Another requirement for information exchange (with the O-APS 
protocol) can also arise during fault event occurrences.  Specifically, 
it was stated earlier that optical rings provide the added benefit of
decoupling fault detection mechanisms from the subsequent recovery 
procedures, Section 2.4.  Now in order to develop a more structured, 
formal mapping between the actual fault detection, notification, and 
recovery mechanisms, interworking with the emerging LMP protocol [LANG] 
can be considered.  Specifically, LMP provides generic fault correlation/
notification functionalities which are independent of the actual fault 
detection schemes, a very germane feature.  Moreover, recent proposals 
for new WDM-transport related considerations within the LMP framework 
[FREDETTE] will undoubtedly help improve its scalability and fault 
notification timings in optical (ring) networks.  As this work matures, 
mapping LMP notifications to O-APS recovery mechanisms (e.g., via 
defining switching triggers) can improve overall architectural 
modularities/orthogonalities and this requires further investigation.

3.2.3 Multi-Layer Escalation Strategies

Ghani et. al.								[Page 30]


Assuming that fast optical (ring) lightpath protection schemes will 
emerge, inter-layer protection "collisions" will be of concern.  Since
multiple protocols can provide recovery mechanisms operating across
multiple domains, the simultaneous interference of such functionalities 
(e.g., optical lightpath protection, SONET/SDH APS, MPLS LSP protection 
switching, IP flow re-routing) can lead to serious shortcomings, such as
reduced resource utilization and data routing instabilities [DEMEESTER],
[MANCHESTER2].  For example, optical lightpath recovery times can overlap 
with (client) SONET/SDH circuit or MPLS LSP protection timescales.  
Clearly, a mechanism is required to coordinate recovery actions between 
the various layers (packet, circuit, wavelength, fiber).  This issue is 
commonly termed as escalation strategy design and has been treated in 
the broader research literature [GHANI1],[DEMEESTER],[MANCHESTER2].
Specifically, two types of escalation strategies have been proposed, 
namely bottom-up and top-down approaches, see [DEMEESTER] for full 
details.  The former scheme assumes that "lower-level" recovery schemes 
(e.g., optical ring protection) are more efficient and expedient, and 
therefore inhibits higher-layer protection switching (such as IP re-
routing, MPLS/ATM LSP protection switching, or SONET/SDH APS).  
Alternatively, the top-down approach attempts service recovery at the 
higher layers first before invoking "lower layer" (e.g., optical) 
recovery.  The reasoning here is that higher-layer protection can be 
more service selective, and therefore efficient.  Clearly, these are 
both advanced mechanisms and require complex signaling and hold-off 
timer mechanisms [GHANI2] to coordinate the different layer recovery 
procedures.  Overall, the SLA's between the network operators and their 
clients will determine the necessary timescales for protection recovery 
(e.g., 50 ms, 200 ms, 5 minutes, etc) and will also impact escalation 
strategy design.  Note that a broader delineation of escalation 
strategies is also presented in [MANCHESTER2], i.e., serial and parallel
approaches.

As far as the proposed optical (ring) protection framework is concerned, 
escalation strategies can be implemented using either MPLS/GMPLS or 
non-MPLS (non-GMPLS) type control-planes.  Carefully note that this 
pertains to how protection capabilities are initiated and not the 
subsequent switching signaling actions.  Consider the former case, in 
which the "higher layers" (e.g., packet LSP) are also controlled 
(provisioned and protected) by the MPLS (GMPLS) framework.  Assuming a 
generalized MPLS LSP restoration framework [XU] at all layers, escalation
strategy timing is facilitated by this common control framework.  The
appropriate LSP protection timer mechanisms can specify hold-off times, 
alarm message (FIS) spacings, and alarm message durations.  Clearly, 
judicious choices of these parameters at different LSP levels (packet, 
circuit, wavelength lightpath, fiberpath) can be used to design advanced 
"inter-layer" escalation strategies.  For example, at the wavelength LSP 
level, small hold-off times and FIS spacings can be used to enact fast 
(sub-50 ms) recovery.  Additionally, the duration of lightpath-level FIS
messaging can be restricted to a timescale window, beyond which lightpath 
FIS notification is terminated.  This duration (plus an acceptable 
guard-time) can be the hold-off time for "higher-layer" packet LSP FIS 
message generation.  Note that this example details a "bottom-up" 
recovery case, and a complimentary "top-down" case can also be detailed.  
Specifically, lightpath recovery hold-off times can be set larger than 

Ghani et. al.								[Page 31]

packet LSP notification durations, thereby permitting more selective "per-
CoS" or "per-LSP/G-LSP" re-routing (based upon priorities, policies, etc).  
However, given the increased complexity and signaling requirements of 
top-down approaches, many operators may not find them very attractive in 
practical network settings.

Meanwhile, for the non-MPLS (non-GMPLS) control specific case, escalation 
strategy design can be more complicated since generalized timing control 
and signaling mechanisms may not exist at all protocol layers.  In 
particular, this situation will arise if MPLS (GMPLS) protection is not 
used at the various networking "levels", e.g., O-APS at optical 
lightpath level, SONET/SDH APS at the circuit tributary level, MPLS LSP 
protection at flow level, etc.  In general, this makes it more difficult 
to control inter-layer protection recovery timings, since inter-layer
synchronization needs to be addressed/defined.  For example, optical 
(WDM)-SONET/SDH protection interworkings may possibly need SONET/SDH 
hold-off timers, requiring changes to existing standards and deployed 
equipment [MANCHESTER2], raising even further challenges and complexities.
In such cases, simpler "all-or-nothing" interworkings may be more 
feasible.  For example, for the case of traditional "SONET-over-WDM", 
either optical ring or SONET APS recovery can be disabled.  Nevertheless, 
for higher-layer IP packet traffic, "bottom-up" escalation strategies can
usually be implemented safely by simply ensuring small enough FIS message
windows, i.e., versus IGP re-routing timescales.  In general, escalation
strategy design is a complex issue and needs significant investigation.

3.3 Additional Considerations

Albeit detailed, the above discussions have only focused on basic 
optical ring definitions and provisioning issues.  Clearly, many more 
advanced concerns relating to optical rings can be tabled, but their 
detailed treatment is beyond the scope of this document.  Nevertheless, 
a brief synopsis is presented in order to stimulate further work.

3.3.1 Multi-Ring Provisioning

In most current SONET networks, multi-ring architectures are very 
common.  Specifically, smaller rings are used to aggregate traffic from 
local domains onto larger rings spanning increased distances (metro, 
regional), and standards exist for so-called dual ring interworking
(DRI) interconnection between multiple SONET/SDH rings [GR1230],[G.842].
Likewise, as optical rings emerge (most likely re-using much of the 
existing SONET/SDH ring fiber infrastructures), there will be a strong 
requirement for similar optical ring interworkings, namely to route 
lightpaths in between multiple rings.  In addition to applying the
conventional DRI concepts, inter-connection can be achieved by simpler, 
static "back-to-back" O-ADM co-location or via more advanced, dynamic 
OXC switching devices [ARIJIS].  Now conceivably, different optical 
ring types (e.g., O-BLSR, O-BLSR, O-UPSR) can be used for an 
end-to-end circuit connection, along with their respective "localized"
protection mechanisms (i.e., protection zones).  Clearly, this may also 
permit greater latitudes in user SLA definitions.

>From a routing/provisioning point of view, there are various ways to 
handle such "multi-ring" architectures.  In the longer run (and for 

Ghani et. al.								[Page 32]

larger rings) it may be advantageous to move to a hierarchical routing
setup.  Specifically, individual rings would be grouped into separate 
domains, e.g., autonomous systems (AS), and multi-ring provisioning 
would be performed under the broader context of inter-domain 
provisioning [GHANI1],[GUO2],[PAPADIMITRIOU2],[RAJAGOPALAN].  Here, 
added enhancements to emerging (optical) network interface definitions 
(O-NNI) [PAPADIMITRIOU2] may be required, e.g., for setup signaling, 
protection switching between multiple rings, etc (further study needed).
Alternatively, a more immediate alternative is that of intra-domain 
provisioning between rings, especially where multiple smaller rings 
constitute a domain, i.e., single ring represents an area instead.  
Here, since opaque LSA's only have area scope, further work is required 
in order to define summary LSA's to provide enough information for 
inter-ring (i.e., intra-domain) provisioning, yet without flooding the 
network with message updates.

3.3.2 Hybrid Mesh-Ring Interworking

Similar to the case of multi-ring provisioning (above), the broader
evolution towards mesh/mesh-ring network topologies is also an important
concern.  From an operator migration point of view, both ring and mesh
topologies have their respective advantages/disadvantages.  Ring 
topologies allow for fast, well-defined protection switching concepts but 
have reduced connectivity (degree two).  Meanwhile, mesh networks offer 
better connectivity and improved resource efficiencies but lack well-
defined protection switching features.  Hence, a likely, cost-effective 
migration path will be for operators to first migrate their existing 
SONET/SDH (TDM-based) rings to counterpart optical rings and then move 
towards mesh or "hybrid" mesh-ring topologies, inline with growth in 
traffic demand and operational experience.  These evolutions can be done 
either via phased expansions to existing ring topologies (i.e., adding 
fibers between non-adjacent ring nodes to "break" the ring) or altogether 
new (i.e., "greenfield-type") deployments.  Such cases present two 
foreseeable interworking requirements, namely for ring emulation and 
ring-mesh interconnection purposes (and others may also emerge) [GUO2].  
Either way, it is clear that provisioning features for hybrid topologies 
will be a crucial requirement for operators as they move to deploy or
expand their optical network offerings.

On a high level, ring emulation basically entails provisioning/operating 
"virtual" rings on top of mesh (network) topologies, e.g., via the 
concept of ring covers [PAPADIMITRIOU3].  For operators accustomed to 
operating ring networks, this capability will still allow them to expand 
to mesh topologies, and is particularly germane to the case of phased-in
ring-to-mesh expansions.  For example, different ring types (O-UPSR, 
O-BLSR, O-BPSR) can be deployed in selective parts of a mesh network 
topology, thereby exploiting the advantages of fast ring-based 
protection switching.  Additionally, for richly-connected mesh networks, 
operators can offer virtual private optical ring (VPOR) services to large 
clients, an attractive proposition.  Note that ring emulation will 
require that specific network nodes (i.e., those sitting on multiple 
rings) have more advanced spatial switching characteristics, as yielded 
by OXC/PXC designs and not basic O-ADM designs.  Moreover, these nodes 
must be "ring-enabled", and most notably, be capable of meeting fast 
protection switching requirements.  

Ghani et. al.								[Page 33]

Meanwhile, the issue of ring-mesh interconnection arises when 
provisioning lighpath channels across multiple, separate ring and mesh 
topologies (e.g., metro-regional rings to long-haul meshes).  Here, 
the mesh network segments themselves may or may not perform ring 
emulation, and therefore this becomes a generalization of the multi-ring 
interconnection case (Section 3.3.1).  However, many of the concepts 
discussed for the multi-ring case, such as intra- and inter-domain 
partitioning, are also applicable here.  Of particular concern will be 
achieving commensurate protection switching timescales in the mesh-
network segments.  However, here it is expected that as standards 
evolve, many of the optical ring protection switching concepts/protocols 
will likely also be leveraged for mesh architectures.  For example, mesh 
span protection or mesh end-to-end channel protection (via diverse 
routing) can re-use or extend the working/protection channel setup and 
protection signaling mechanisms developed for optical rings.

Overall, hybrid topology provisioning, for both ring emulation and ring-
mesh interconnection, will require additional specifications.  
Considering the more likely case of intra-domain provisioning, topology/
resource discovery methods will need to perform summarization/aggregation 
of ring information.  Some early work along these lines is emerging, 
proposing "ring ID" and "ring type" sub-TLV definitions for opaque LSA's, 
see [GUO2],[PAPADIMITRIOU3].  Provisioning lightpaths across ring-mesh
topologies or "virtual ring" mesh networks will require new resource/
constrained-routing algorithms also.  A related, key issue here will
be implementing protection switching signaling (as per the user SLA
requirements), e.g., protecting a fiber cut between multiple "virtual" 
rings or an optical channel failure across multiple network ring/mesh 
network segments.  Cleary, there is a strong need for more detailed work 
in the area of hybrid topology provisioning.

3.3.3 Resilient Packet Ring (RPR) Synergies 

So far, only "full-granularity" lightpaths have been considered, i.e., 
ring channels utilizing full wavelength capacity, such as OC-48/STM-16 
and OC-192/STM-64.  However, new generations of advanced integrated edge 
devices (IED's) are beginning to appear, integrating (sub-rate) packet, 
circuit, and wavelength/fiber switching capabilities onto a common 
platform.  In a timely manner, the broader GMPLS framework is also being
extended to provision related sub-rate tributary channels [ASHWOOD1],
[XU] (both packet and circuit).  Therefore, for improved generality, 
GMPLS ring provisioning mechanisms/concepts can also be considered for 
various "sub-rate ring" architectures.  Sub-rate rings can improve 
wavelength utilization and provide finer-granularity connections between 
smaller users.  A very good example of a sub-rate (packet) ring 
technology is the emerging resilient packet ring (RPR) architecture 
(IEEE 802.17).  Recently there has been significant interest and 
development in this space, as noted by work on IP over RPR (IPoRPR) 
architectures, see [HERRERA].
  
Since packet rings operate on an "electronic" level and require 
visibility into the packet stream, from a technology point of view, 
they are quite different from the optical rings proposed herein.  
Nevertheless, there are many generic architectural aspects of optical 

Ghani et. al.								[Page 34]

rings which can also apply to packet rings, and these can be further 
investigated.  Examples include setup signaling procedures, protection 
signaling, constrained routing, etc.  Furthermore, RPR's can be mapped 
onto optical ring wavelength channels, thereby permitting potential 
traffic/resource engineering synergies, i.e., advanced "multi-ring" 
architectures with "embedded" sub-rate packet ring channels being 
carried in larger granularity optical ring channels.  Additionally, 
given the fast fault detection/recovery mechanisms being proposed for 
RPR designs (in comparison with mesh IP packet re-routing), the 
likelihood of protection "collisions" between optical ring and RPR 
recovery mechanisms increases.  Hence protection escalation strategies 
(Section 3.2.3) are of importance in such interworkings and should be 
designed to properly arbitrate between the respective protection 
protocol(s) or different levels thereof (packet, circuit).  All of 
these topics need further, more detailed investigation.

4. APPENDIX A: Review of SONET Ring Architectures

SONET (SDH) ring architectures have emerged to dominate the transport 
landscape.  Termed also as self-healing rings (SHR), perhaps their 
defining characteristic is stringent recovery timescales.  Namely, 
SONET (and SDH) standards stipulate a service recovery time of 50 ms 
after the fault condition (i.e., including detection, guard time, 
switching time, ring propagation delays, and re-synchronization).  
These values are derived from frame synchronization at the lowest 
frame speed, namely DS1 (1.5 Mb/s).  A very brief outline of the 
SONET/SDH ring framework is given here.  However, this summary is only 
intended to serve as a background reference, and interested readers 
are referred to the specifications for complete details [ANSI],[ITU],
[GR1230].  As will be seen, these existing architectures will form 
the basis for much of the counterpart optical ring frameworks.

4.1 Uni-directional Path-Switched Ring (UPSR)

The UPSR concept is designed for channel level protection in two-fiber 
rings.  Although two-fiber BLSR architectures also exist, termed BLSR/2,
the UPSR architecture is significantly less complex.  UPSR rings 
dedicate one fiber for working TDM channels (timeslots) and the other 
for corresponding protection channels (counter-propagating directions).
Traffic is permanently bridged at the head-end and sent along both 
fibers, namely 1+1 protection.  UPSR working traffic travels in the 
clockwise direction and protection traffic travels in the counter-
clockwise direction.  This implies that bi-directional connections 
will consume resources on all working and protection fibers, 
restricting ring throughput to that of a single fiber.  Clearly, UPSR
rings represent simpler designs and do not require any notification or 
switchover signaling mechanisms between ring nodes, i.e., receiver nodes
perform channel switchovers.  As such, they are resource inefficient 
since they do not re-use fiber capacity (both spatially and between 
working/protection paths).  Moreover, span (i.e., fiber) protection is 
undefined for UPSR rings, and such rings are typically most efficient 
in access rings where traffic patterns are concentrated around 
collector hubs.

Ghani et. al.								[Page 35]

4.2 Bi-Directional Line Switched Ring (BLSR)

BLSR rings are designed to protect at the line (i.e., fiber) level, and 
there are two possible variants, namely two-fiber (BLSR/2) and four-
fiber (BLSR/4) rings.  The BLSR/2 concept is designed to overcome the 
spatial reuse limitations associated with two-fiber UPSR rings and only
provides path (i.e., line) protection.  Specifically, the BLSR/2 
scheme divides the capacity timeslots within each fiber evenly between 
same-direction working and protection channels (with working channels
on a given fiber being protected by protection channels on the other
fiber).  Therefore bi-directional connections between nodes will now 
traverse the same intermediate nodes but on differing fibers.  This 
allows for sharing loads away from saturated spans and increases the 
level of spatial re-use (sharing), a major advantage over two-fiber 
UPSR rings.  Protection slots for working channels are pre-assigned 
based upon a fixed odd/even numbering scheme, and in case of a fiber 
cut, all affected timeslots are looped back in the opposite direction 
of the ring.  This is commonly termed "loop-back" line/span protection 
and avoids any per-channel processing.  However, loop-back protection 
increases the distance and transmission delay of the restored channels 
(nearly doubling path lengths in the worst case).  More importantly, 
since BLSR rings perform line switching at the switching nodes (i.e.,
adjacent to the fault), more complex active signaling functionality 
is required.  Further bandwidth utilization improvements can also be 
made here by allowing lower-priority traffic to traverse on idle 
protection spans.

Four-fiber BLSR rings extend upon the BLSR/2 concepts by providing 
added span switching capabilities.  In BLSR/4 rings, two fibers are 
used for working traffic and two for protection traffic (counter-
propagating pairs, one in each direction).  Again, working traffic 
can be carried in both directions (clockwise, counter-clockwise), 
and this minimizes spatial resource utilization for bi-directional 
connection setups.  Line protection is used when both working and 
protection fibers are cut, looping traffic around the long-side path.  
If, however, only the working fiber is cut, less disruptive switching 
can be performed at the fiber level.  Here, all failed channels are 
switched to the corresponding protection fiber going in the same 
direction (and lower-priority channels pre-empted).  Overall, the 
BLSR/4 ring capacity is twice that of the BLSR/2 ring, and the four-
fiber variant can handle more failures.  Also, it should be noted 
that both two- and four-fiber rings provide node failure recovery 
for pass-through traffic.  Essentially, all channels on all fibers 
traversing the failed node are line switched away from the node.

As mentioned above, BLSR rings (unlike UPSR rings) require a 
protection signaling mechanism.  Since protection channels can be 
shared, each node must have global state, and this requires state 
signaling over both spans (directions) of the ring.  This is achieved 
via an automatic protection switching (APS) protocol running on the 
"embedded" K1/K2 bytes in the SONET/SDH frame overhead, also commonly 
termed as the SONET APS or BLSR K1/K2 byte protocol [GR1230],
[T1.105.01],[G.841].  This protocol uses a 4-bit node identifier (in 
the K1 byte) and hence only allows up to 16 nodes per ring.  Additional 

Ghani et. al.								[Page 36]

bits are designated to identify the type of function requested (e.g., 
bi-directional or unidirectional switching) and the fault condition 
(i.e., channel state).  Control nodes performing the switchover 
functions utilize frame-persistency checks to avoid premature actions 
and discard any invalid message codes.  Further details can be found 
in the associated references.

5. Security Considerations

Security considerations are for future study, in particular with 
regards to signaling extensions and a possibly new O-APS protocol.  
The overall optical ring provisioning framework, however, poses the 
same security requirements as those present in existing MPL(ambda)S 
or GMPLS provisioning architectures.
