 DNS Attrleaf Changes: Fixing Specifications with Underscored Node Name

Abstract

   Original uses of an underscore character as a domain node name
   prefix, which creates a space for constrained interpretation of
   resource records, were specified without the benefit of an IANA
   registry.  This produced an entirely uncoordinated set of name-
   creation activities, all drawing from the same namespace.  A registry
   now has been defined.  However the existing specifications that use
   underscore naming need to be modified, to be in line with the new
   registry.  This document specifies those changes.  The changes
   preserve existing software and operational practice, while adapting
   the specifications for those practices to the newer underscore
   registry model.

1.  Introduction

   Original uses of an underscore character as a domain node name
   [RFC1035] prefix, which creates a space for constrained
   interpretation of resource records, were specified without the
   benefit of an [IANA-reg] registry.  This produced an entirely
   uncoordinated set of name-creation activities, all drawing from the
   same namespace.  A registry has been now defined, and that document
   discusses the background for underscored domain name use [Attrleaf].

   The basic model for underscored name registration, as specified in
   [Attrleaf], is to have each registry entry be unique in terms of the
   combination of a resource record type and a 'global' (highest-level)

   underscored name; that is, the node name beginning with an
   underscore, which is the closest to the DNS root.

   The existing uses of underscored naming have specifications that do
   not reflect the existence of this integrated registry.  For the new
   reader or the new editor of one of those documents, there is
   currently nothing signaling that the underscore name(s) defined in
   the document are now processed through an IANA registry.  This
   document remedies that, by marking such a published document with an
   update, indicating the nature of the change.

   Further, the documents that define the SRV [RFC2782] and URI
   [RFC7553] DNS resource records provide a meta-template for
   underscored name assignments, partially based on separate registries
   [RFC6335].  For the portion that selects the global (highest-level)
   underscored name, this perpetuates uncoordinated assignment
   activities by separate technical specifications, out of the same name
   space.  This document remedies that by providing detail for revisions
   to the SRV and URI specifications, to bring their use in line with
   the single, integrated global underscore registry.

   The result of these changes preserves existing software and
   operations practices, while adapting the technical specifications to
   the newer underscore registry model.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Underscored RRset Use in Specifications

   The use of underscored node names is specific to each RRTYPE that is
   being scoped.  Each name defines a place, but does not define the
   rules for what appears underneath that place, either as additional
   underscored naming or as a leaf node with resource records.  Details
   for those rules are provided by specifications for individual
   RRTYPEs.  The sections below describe the way that existing
   underscore labels are used with the RRTYPEs that they name.

2.1.  TXT RRset Use



      NOTE -  Documents falling into this category include:

         [RFC6763], [RFC6120], [RFC5518], [RFC5617], [RFC6376],
         [RFC7208], and [RFC7489]

   This section provides a generic approach for changes to existing
   specifications that define straightforward use of underscored node
   names, when scoping the use of a "TXT" RRset.  The approach provides
   the information needed for adapting such specifications to the use of
   the IANA DNS Underscore Global Scoped Entry Registry [Attrleaf].
   Hence the approach is meant both as an update to these existing
   specifications, and as guidance for changes when those documents are
   revised.

   For any document that specifies the use of a "TXT" RRset under one or
   more underscored names, the 'global' name is expected to be
   registered in the IANA DNS Underscore Global Scoped Entry Registry
   [Attrleaf].  An effort has been made to locate existing drafts that
   do this, register the global underscored names, and list them in the
   initial set of names added to the registry.

   If a public specification defines use of a TXT RRset and calls for
   the use of an underscore-prefixed domain name, here is a template of
   suggested text for registering the global underscored name -- the one
   closest to the root -- through the IANA Considerations section of the
   specification:

      "Per" [Attrleaf] "please add the following entry to the DNS
      Underscore Global Scoped Entry Registry:"

   +--------+----------------+-----------------------------------------+
   | RR     | _NODE NAME     | REFERENCE                               |

   Specification of the SRV [RFC2782] resource record provides a
   template for use of underscored node names.  The global name is
   characterised as referencing the 'protocol' that is associated with
   "SRV" RRset usage.

   This section provides a generic approach for changes to existing

2.3.  URI RRset Use

   Specification of the URI [RFC7553] resource record provides a
   template for use of underscored node names.  The global name is
   characterised as naming the 'protocol' that is associated with "URI"
   RR usage or by reversing an Enumservice sequence [RFC6117].

3.  Underscored Template Specifications

3.1.  SRV Specification Changes

   The specification for a domain name, under which an SRV [RFC2782]
   resource record appears, provides a template for use of underscored
   node names.  The global underscored name is characterised as
   indicating the 'protocol' that is associated with "SRV" RR usage.

   Text of that existing specification is changed as follows:

      OLD:

   The format of the SRV RR

    Here is the format of the SRV RR, whose DNS type code is 33:
          _Service._Proto.Name TTL Class SRV Priority Weight Port Target
    ...
    Proto
         The symbolic name of the desired protocol, with an underscore
         (_) prepended to prevent collisions with DNS labels that occur
         in nature.  _TCP and _UDP are at present the most useful values
         for this field, though any name defined by Assigned Numbers or
         locally may be used (as for Service).  The Proto is case
         insensitive.

      NEW:

         The format of the SRV RR



         Here is the format of the SRV RR, whose DNS type code is 33:



            "_Service._Proto.Name TTL Class SRV Priority Weight Port
            Target"

            _..._

         Proto

            The symbolic name of the desired protocol, with an
            underscore (_) prepended to prevent collisions with DNS
            labels that occur in nature. _TCP and _UDP are at present
            the most useful values for this field.  The Proto is case
            insensitive.

            The SRV RRset protocol (global) underscored name SHOULD be
            registered in the IANA DNS Underscore Global Scoped Entry
            Registry [Attrleaf].

3.2.  URI Specification Changes

   Specification for the domain name, under which a URI [RFC7553]
   resource record occurs, is similar to that for the SRV [RFC2782]
   resource record, although the text refers only to 'service' name,
   rather than distinguishing 'service' from 'protocol'.  Further, the
   URI RR specification permits alternative underscored naming schemes:




Crocker                    Expires May 7, 2019                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft              DNS AttrLeaf Fix               November 2018


      One matches what is used for "SRV", with the global underscored
      name called "protocol'.

      The other is based on a reversing of an Enumservice [RFC6117]
      sequence.

   Text of that existing specification is changed as follows:

      OLD:

   4.1.  Owner Name, Class, and Type

   The URI owner name is subject to special conventions.

   Just like the SRV RR [RFC2782], the URI RR has service information
   encoded in its owner name.  In order to encode the service for a
   specific owner name, one uses service parameters.  Valid service
   parameters are those registered by IANA in the "Service Name and
   Transport Protocol Port Number Registry" [RFC6335] or as "Enumservice
   ---
   Registrations [RFC6117].  The Enumservice Registration parameters are
   reversed (i.e., subtype(s) before type), prepended with an underscore
   (_), and prepended to the owner name in separate labels.  The
   underscore is prepended to the service parameters to avoid collisions
   with DNS labels that occur in nature, and the order is reversed to
   make it possible to do delegations, if needed, to different zones
   (and therefore providers of DNS).

   For example, suppose we are looking for the URI for a service with
   ENUM Service Parameter "A:B:C" for host example.com.  Then we would
   query for (QNAME,QTYPE)=("_C._B._A.example.com","URI").

   As another example, suppose we are looking for the URI for a service
   with Service Name "A" and Transport Protocol "B" for host
   example.com.  Then we would query for
   (QNAME,QTYPE)=("_A._B.example.com","URI").

      NEW:

         4.1.  Owner Name, Class, and Type

         The URI owner name is subject to special conventions.

         As for the SRV RRset [RFC2782], the URI RRset global (highest-
         level) underscored name SHOULD be registered in the IANA DNS
         Underscore Global Scoped Entry Registry [Attrleaf].

         Just like the SRV RRset, the URI RRset has service information
         encoded in its owner name.  In order to encode the service for
         a specific owner name, one uses service parameters.  Valid
         service parameters are:

         +  Those registered by IANA in the "Service Name and Transport
            Protocol Port Number Registry" [RFC6335] . The underscore is
            prepended to the service parameters to avoid collisions with
            DNS labels that occur in nature, and the order is reversed
            to make it possible to do delegations, if needed, to
            different zones (and therefore providers of DNS).

         +  Those listed in "Enumservice Registrations" [RFC6117].  The
            Enumservice Registration parameters are reversed (i.e.,
            subtype(s) before type), prepended with an underscore (_),
            and prepended to the owner name in separate labels.  The
            highest-level (global) underscored Enumservice name becomes
            the global Attrleaf name to register.

         For example, suppose we are looking for the URI for a service
         with ENUM Service Parameter "A:B:C" for host example.com.  Then
         we would query for
         (QNAME,QTYPE)=("_C._B._A.example.com","URI").

         As another example, suppose we are looking for the URI for a
         service with Service Name "A" and Transport Protocol "B" for
         host example.com.  Then we would query for
         (QNAME,QTYPE)=("_A._B.example.com","URI").

3.3.  DNSSEC Signaling Specification Changes

   "Signaling Trust Anchor Knowledge in DNS Security Extensions
   (DNSSEC)" [RFC8145] defines a use of DNS node names that effectively
   consumes all names beginning with the string ""_ta-"", when using the
   NULL RR in the query.

   Text of Section 5.1, "Query Format", of that existing specification,
   is changed as follows:

      OLD:

   For example, a validating DNS resolver ...
                              QNAME=_ta-4444.

      NEW:

         For example, a validating DNS resolver ...  "QNAME=_ta-4444".

         Under the NULL RR, an entry is registered in the IANA DNS
         Underscore Global Scoped Entry Registry [Attrleaf] for all node
         names beginning with ""_ta-"".
