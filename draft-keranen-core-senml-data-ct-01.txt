               SenML Data Value Content-Format Indication
                  draft-keranen-core-senml-data-ct-01

Abstract

   The Sensor Measurement Lists (SenML) media type supports multiple
   types of values, from numbers to text strings and arbitrary binary
   data values.  In order to simplify processing of the data values this
   document proposes to specify a new SenML field for indicating the
   Content-Format of the data.

1.  Introduction

   The Sensor Measurement Lists (SenML) media type [RFC8428] can be used
   to send various different kinds of data.  In the example given in
   Figure 1, a temperature value, an indication whether a lock is open,
   and a data value (with SenML field "vd") read from an NFC reader is
   sent in a single SenML pack.

   [
     {"bn":"urn:dev:ow:10e2073a01080063:","n":"temp","u":"Cel","v":7.1},
     {"n":"open","vb":false},
     {"n":"nfc-reader","vd":"aGkgCg"}
   ]

            Figure 1: SenML pack with unidentified binary data

   The receiver is expected to know how to decode the data in the "vd"
   field based on the context, e.g., name of the data source and out-of-
   band knowledge of the application.  However, this context may not
   always be easily available to entities processing the SenML pack.  To
   facilitate automatic decoding it is useful to be able to indicate an
   Internet media type and content-coding right in the SenML Record.
   The CoAP Content-Format (Section 12.3 in [RFC7252]) provides just
   this information; enclosing a Content-Format number (in this case
   number 60 as defined for media type application/cbor in [RFC7049]) in
   the Record is illustrated in Figure 2.  All registered CoAP content

   formats are listed in the Content Formats subregistry of the CoRE
   Parameters registry [IANA.core-parameters].

   {"n":"nfc-reader", "vd":"gmNmb28YKg", "ct":60}

        Figure 2: SenML Record with binary data identified as CBOR

   In this example SenML Record the data value contains a string "foo"
   and a number 42 encoded in a CBOR [RFC7049] array.  Since the example
   above uses the JSON format of SenML, the data value containing the
   binary CBOR value is base64-encoded.  The data value after base64
   decoding is shown with CBOR diagnostic notation in Figure 3.

   82           # array(2)
      63        # text(3)
         666F6F # "foo"
      18 2A     # unsigned(42)

         Figure 3: Example Data Value in CBOR diagnostic notation

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Readers should also be familiar with the terms and concepts discussed
   in [RFC8428].  Awareness of terminology issues discussed in
   [I-D.bormann-core-media-content-type-format] can also be very
   helpful.

3.  SenML Content-Format ("ct") Field

   When a SenML Record contains a Data Value field ("vd"), the Record
   MAY also include a Content-Format indication field.  The Content-
   Format indication uses label "ct" and an unsigned integer value in
   the range of 0-65535 indicating the CoAP Content-Format of the data
   (similar to CoRE Link Format [RFC6690] "ct" attribute, except that
   the Link Format attribute happens to be encoded as a string).

4.  SenML Content-Type ("content-type") and Content-Coding ("content-
    coding") Fields

   Since some Internet media types and their content coding and
   parameter alternatives do not have assigned CoAP Content-Format
   identifiers, a Content-Type field ("content-type") can be



Keranen & Bormann      Expires September 13, 2019               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft SenML Data Value Content-Format Indication     March 2019


   alternatively used to indicate the Content-Type of the data.
   Content-Coding of the Content-Type can be identified using a
   "content-coding" field.  If Content-Coding is not specified with
   Content-Type, identity (i.e., no) transformation is used.  The
   Content-Type field MUST NOT be used in the same record as a Content-
   Format field and records with Content-Format field MUST NOT contain a
   Content-Coding field.

5.  SenML Base Content-Format ("bct"), Base Content-Type ("bcontent-
    type), and Base Content-Coding ("bcontent-coding") Fields

   The Base Content-Format Field, label "bct", provides a default value
   for the Content-Format Field (label "ct") within its range.  The
   range of the base field includes the record containing it, up to (but
   not including) the next record containing a "bct" field, if any, or
   up to the end of the pack otherwise.  Resolution (Section 4.6 of
   [RFC8428]) of this base field is performed by adding its value with
   the label "ct" to all records in this range that carry a "vd" field
   but do not already contain a Content-Format ("ct") field.

   The Base Content-Type Field, label "bcontent-type", provides a
   default value for the Content-Type Field (label "content-type")
   within its range.  The Base Content-Coding Field, label "bcontent-
   coding", provides a default value for the Content-Coding Field (label
   "content-coding") within its range.  The range and resolution rules
   for both are identical to Base Content-Format Field, except that the
   value is added with label "content-coding" (for Base Content-Coding)
   or with label "content-type" (for Base Content-Type).

6.  Security Considerations

   The indication of a media type in the data does not exempt a
   consuming application from properly checking its inputs.  Also, the
   ability for an attacker to supply crafted SenML data that specify
   media types chosen by the attacker may expose vulnerabilities of
   handlers for these media types to the attacker.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign new labels in the "SenML Labels"
   subregistry of the SenML registry [IANA.senml] (as defined in
   [RFC8428]) for the Content-Format indication as per Table 1:
