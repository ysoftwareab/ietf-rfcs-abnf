Abstract

   This document describes a set of extensions (protocol operations and
   textual conventions) to the existing SNMP framework architecture
   [RFC2571].  These extensions provide mechanisms for efficient bulk
   retrieval of virtual SNMP tables that are user-defined in terms of
   similarly-instanced column entries from existing MIB tables.

1.  The SNMP Network Management Framework


   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

      -  An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].

      -  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
         purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
         Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
         RFC 1155 [RFC1155], RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC 1215 [RFC1215].
         The second version, called SMIv2, is described in RFC 2578
         [RFC2578], RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

      -  Message protocols for transferring management information. The
         first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
         described in RFC 1157 [RFC1157]. A second version of the SNMP
         message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
         protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [RFC1901]
         and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version of the message
         protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [RFC1906],
         RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].

      -  Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
         first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
         described in RFC 1157 [RFC1157]. A second set of protocol
         operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
         [RFC1905].

      -  A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573
         [RFC2573] and the view-based access control mechanism described
         in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB. Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine

Internet Draft     SNMP Bulk Data Transfer Extensions       1 March 2002


   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.


2.  Overview

   This document describes a set of SNMP extensions to current protocol
   operations [RFC1905] to provide for efficient management operations
   (i.e. bulk retrieval of mib data).


2.1.  Terms

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.2.  Motivations for the Extensions

   Experience has shown that current SNMP protocol operations and
   management structures are not ideally suited to retrieving large
   amounts of information.  The extensions described in this document
   are specifically designed to minimize, or provide opportunities to
   minimize, the following problems which inhibit the effectiveness of
   SNMP:

      -  The existing bulk transfer mechanism (GetBulk) is difficult to
         use and difficult to control (can overshoot table boundaries).

      -  No mechanism is currently provided for transfering large tables
         to the NMS without constant, active NMS participation.

      -  No mechanism is currently provided to allow filtering of large
         tables by column constraints.

      -  No mechanism is currently provided to allow creation of
         synthetic tables by combining columns from existing tables.


2.3.  Design Goals

   Several goals were identified when considering the kind and nature of
   extensions that were needed:

      -  Define a mechanism that is easy for normal humans to implement
         and use.




EOS Working Group        Expires September 2002                 [Page 4]

Internet Draft     SNMP Bulk Data Transfer Extensions       1 March 2002


      -  Define a mechanism that can be used to transfer large tables to
         the NMS without constant NMS participation.  Both a "push" and
         "pull" model is supported.


3.  The Extensions

   The extension consists of a mib document together with a description
   of how it can be incorporated into an existing SNMP Agent in order to
   achieve the desired bulk data retrieval behavior.

4.  Elements of Procedure


4.1.  Creating a row in the sliceTable

   This can be a partial or complete MIB table or even a synthetic table
   which is user-defined and created by listing a set of column Object
   Identifiers together as a group.  Entries in this table are expected
   to persist and be useful in repeated snapshot requests.


4.2.  Creating a row in the xferTable

   This includes information about the fileserver(s) (either local or
   remote) IP address, pathname, login authentication and file transfer
   protocol.  Entries in this table are expected to persist and be
   useful in repeated file "push" operations.



4.3.  Activating a snapshot and file transfer

   Perform an SNMP Set to the RowStatus variable 'snapshotEntryStatus',
   giving it the value of 'createAndGo' or 'active'.  This will initiate
   the snapshot operation as well as file transfer(s).  Note that this
   variable could be set via remote SNMP Sets, via the local agent's
   craft interface, or via a threshold or timer event, such as found in
   the DISMAN-SCHEDULE-MIB.



4.4.  Monitoring/Controlling a queued transfer

   Perform an SNMP Get to the xferCtlTable to monitor or control (cancel
   or retry) individual file transfers.

5.  Coexistence and Transition

   Since this extension doesn't directly impact existing SNMP Protocol
   operations, coexistence and transition issues are minimized.  If an
   NMS attempts to use this extension and an agent supports it, life is
   good.  Otherwise, fallback to traditional protocol operations is
   still possible.

APPENDIXES


A.  Impact to SNMP and other Protocols


A.1.  SNMPv3

   An issue remains whether a new message processing model MUST be
   specified as part of the SNMPv3 (or later) standard. Otherwise, it is
   not seen that these extensions pose any impact to other SNMPv3
   architectural components (i.e. USM, VACM) because the new protocol
   operations and their contents contain sufficient information (along
   with the information provided in whatever version-specific message
   wrapper they are contined within) to satisfy the abstract service
   interfaces for those components.
