Internet-Draft              XMPP URI Format                   March 2004


1. Introduction

   The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) [XMPP-CORE]
   specifies that within the context of the streaming XML technology
   that forms the foundation of XMPP, the addresses of XMPP entities
   MUST NOT be prepended with a URI scheme (as defined in RFC 2396
   [URI]).  However, many applications external to the existing network
   would like to address XMPP entities as full URIs; examples are
   databases that need to store XMPP addresses as URIs and non-native
   user agents (such as web browsers) that provide an interface to XMPP
   services.  This memo defines an xmpp: URI scheme for use by such
   applications, and conforms to both the requirements in Registration
   Procedures for URL Scheme Names [URL-REG] and the recommendations in
   Guidelines for new URL Schemes [URL-GUIDE].

1.1 Terminology

   This document inherits terminology described in [XMPP-CORE].

   The capitalized key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
   "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [TERMS].

1.2 Discussion Venue

   The author welcomes discussion and comments related to the topics
   presented in this document.  The preferred forum is the
   <xmppwg@jabber.org> mailing list, for which archives and subscription
   information are available at <http://www.jabber.org/cgi-bin/mailman/
   listinfo/xmppwg/>.

2. Narrative

2.1 Rationale

   Many types of application can be built using XMPP.  The best-known
   such application is instant messaging (IM) and presence (as described
   in [IMP-MODEL] and [IMP-REQS] and defined for XMPP in [XMPP-IM]).
   Therefore it might seem appropriate to use the im: and pres: URI
   schemes specified by Common Profile for Instant Messaging (CPIM)
   [CPIM] and Common Profile for Presence (CPP) [CPP], rather than to
   define an XMPP-specific URI scheme.  However, while the im: and pres:
   URI schemes are appropriate for instant messaging and presence
   applications and are therefore mentioned normatively in [XMPP-IM],
   they are not necessarily appropriate for all XMPP applications.
   Because XMPP is fundamentally an XML streaming technology rather than
   an instant messaging and presence technology per se, XMPP

Internet-Draft              XMPP URI Format                   March 2004


   applications may conform to [XMPP-CORE] but not [XMPP-IM] and thus
   not implement instant messaging and presence semantics.  Indeed, XMPP
   is already used in applications such as network management, workflow
   applications, generic publish-subscribe, remote procedure calls,
   content syndication, gaming, and middleware.  These applications
   require an addressing scheme that is not tied to the particular
   semantics of the im: and pres: URI schemes.  Therefore, this document
   defines a generic URI scheme that will enable applications to address
   as a URI any entity that can communicate via XMPP.

   Note well that on the XMPP network itself, entities MUST be addressed
   as <[node@]domain[/resource]> (i.e., without a URI scheme) rather
   than as <xmpp:[node@]domain[/resource]>.  The xmpp: URI format is
   provided for the sake of non-native interfaces and applications only,
   and MUST NOT be used by native applications when addressing XML
   stanzas sent over the XMPP network.

2.2 Form

   The syntax for an xmpp: URI is as follows (where the jid rule is
   defined in [XMPP-CORE]).

         "xmpp:" jid [ "?" query ]

   An xmpp: URI is opaque rather than hierarchical, and thus is similar
   to a mailto: URI specified in RFC 2368 [MAILTO].  Because an xmpp:
   URI is opaque, the JID contained therein SHOULD include only a node
   identifier (OPTIONAL) and domain identifier (REQUIRED) as defined in
   [XMPP-CORE].  An xmpp: URI MAY include the resource identifier
   portion of a JID if the XMPP entity must be addressed as such, but
   this is not recommended since the delimiter used before a resource
   identifier in XMPP addresses is the slash character ("/"), which is
   discouraged by [URI] in opaque URIs.

2.3 Query Component

   If an xmpp: URI is presented in an end-user application that provides
   a non-native interface to an XMPP service (e.g., a web browser),
   interacting with such a URI SHOULD trigger the application to present
   a user with an appropriate interface to complete an action such as
   sending a message or sending presence.  In order to specify the
   possible actions, two "header" values of the query component are
   defined: "presence" and "message", as described below.

2.3.1 Messages

   In order to invoke an interace for sending a message, the URI SHOULD
   be of the form <xmpp:user@host?message>.

Internet-Draft              XMPP URI Format                   March 2004


   The query component MAY include parameters that further specify the
   message to be sent to the intended recipient.  The following
   parameters are OPTIONAL for messages, corresponding to the <body/>,
   <subject/>, and <thread/> children of the XML <message/> stanza as
   defined in [XMPP-IM]:

   o  body

   o  subject

   o  thread (for conversation tracking)

   The following example illustrates the use of these parameters:

   Sending a message

      xmpp:user@host?message&subject=hi&body=Hello%20World&thread=abc123


2.3.2 Presence

   In order to invoke an interace for sending presence information, the
   URI SHOULD be of the form <xmpp:user@host?presence>.

   The query component MAY include parameters that further specify the
   presence information to be sent to the intended recipient.  The
   following parameters are OPTIONAL for presence, corresponding to the
   'type' attribute and the <show/>, <status/>, and <priority/> children
   of the <presence/> stanza as defined in [XMPP-IM]:

   o  type ('unavailable' only; if not specified, the sender is defined
      to be online and available)

   o  show (one of 'away', 'xa', 'dnd', or 'chat')

   o  status (user-defined status message)

   o  priority (an integer specifying rough likelihood of receiving
      messages at this resource)

   The following example illustrates the use of these parameters:

   Sending Presence Information

      xmpp:user@host?presence&show=dnd&status=taking%20a%20nap

3. xmpp: URI IANA Registration

   This section provides the information required to register the xmpp:
   URI scheme.

3.1 URI Scheme Name

   xmpp

3.2 URI Scheme Syntax

   The syntax for an xmpp: URI is defined below using Augmented
   Backus-Naur Form as specified by [ABNF].  The jid rule is defined in
   [XMPP-CORE].

   XMPP-URI = "xmpp:" jid [ "?" query ]


3.3 Character Encoding Considerations

   Representation of non-ASCII character sets in local-part strings is
   limited to the standard methods provided as extensions to RFC 2822
   [IMF].  Specifically, for each byte, if the byte is not in the set
   A-Za-z0-9!$*.?_~+= then transform the byte to %hexhex as described in
   Section 2.2.5 of [URL-GUIDE].

3.4 Intended usage

   The xmpp: URI is intended to be used by interfaces to the XMPP
   network from non-native user agents such as web browsers, as well as
   by applications that need to address XMPP entities as full URIs.

3.5 Security considerations

   See Security Considerations (Section 5) of this document.

3.6 Relevant publications

3.9 Applications and/or protocols which use this URI scheme name

   Applications that provide an interface to XMPP services or that need
   to address XMPP entities as full URIs.

4. IANA Considerations

   This entire document addresses IANA considerations.

5. Security Considerations

   Detailed security considerations for XMPP are given in [XMPP-CORE].
   Providing an interface to XMPP services from non-native applications
   introduces new security concerns.  For example, the ability to
   interact with XMPP entities via a web browser may expose sensitive
   information to attacks that are not possible or that are unlikely on
   a native XMPP network.  Due care must be taken in deciding what
   information is appropriate for representing in xmpp: URIs; in
   particular, passwords MUST NOT be represented.
