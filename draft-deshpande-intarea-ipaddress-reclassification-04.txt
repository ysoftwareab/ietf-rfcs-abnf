Internet-Draft       IP address reclassification           April 2019

   1. Introduction
   
   This draft proposes IPv6 address re-classification. An attempt is
   made to identify the significant traffic bottlenecks in the
   Internet. IPv6 address space is re-classified by adding a new virtual
   address space which facilitated a highly parallelized traffic control
   system to resolve the traffic bottleneck problems.
   By assuming a mathematical premise of a finite topological space
   with interior, exterior and closure an attempt is made to
   retain the open system interconnection characteristic of the
   Internet in the virtual address space through virtual BGP
   neighborship. Multipath and Multipath TCP connections are also
   recognized as being suitable for implementing the virtual BGP
   neighborship. The IPv6 ULA addressing scheme is recognized as being
   well suited for address assignment in the virtual address space.
   A more detailed architecture is beyond scope as of now however an
   attempt is made to spell out the design guidelines. A glossary at
   the end contains the meaning of terms and definitions used in this
   draft.
   
   2. The Mathematical premise for the electromagnetic equivalent
   
   The electromagnetic phenomenon observed in a waveguide is that the
   wave propagation can be restricted to one dimension through total
   internal reflection. At the critical angle the wave is split into
   two or more waves. This is the principle behind multipath
   propagation and also the basis for MIMO technology. Mathematically
   this is similar to the path connectedness in a finite topological
   space. The MIMO routing principles are thus applicable to wired
   networks. MIMO is equivalent to Multipath. Therefore as MIMO routing
   is cluster by cluster, multipath routing in wired networks is also
   restricted to occur through clusters rather than between nodes.
   
   3. Design considerations for the Internet architecture
   
   Rather than viewing Computer communication as Host to Host as in
   the traditional OSI and TCP models the computational and algorithmic
   complexity of a network can be better understood by taking a step
   back and viewing the communication as Machine to Machine.
   
   On applying the principles of the Von Neumann bottleneck the
   significant traffic can be identified as transit traffic between
   ISPs and peer to peer traffic between ISPs. In other words the
   Inter-AS traffic and the CsC traffic.

   4. Complexities in analyzing the Internet as a topological space
   
   4.1 Complexity of Computation
   4.1.1 A local computation may not yield a global routing table which
   can resolve global routing problems. 
   4.1.2 OSPF computation is evenly spread through the area or the core
   AS.
   
   4.2 Complexity of Algorithms
   4.2.1 OSPF is based on Heap sort which is a maximally efficient
   priority queue based on the heap data structure
   4.2.2 OSPF redistribution repeats the advertisement of routes. A
   classful boundary exists between areas as OSPF reoriginates
   summary routes at an ABR
   4.2.3 The above constraints bring about restrictions on
   redistribution,re-routing, multipath routing due to the classful
   queuing and addressing limits.
   4.2.4 BGP selects and inserts certain routes (path selection
   attributes) and merges routes. Therefore BGP can be considered as
   having characteristics of selection, insertion sorts as well as
   merge sort.
    
   4.3 Complexity of Connectedness
   4.3.1 Path connectedness in a finite space acts as a limitation
   for multipath routing. Thus multipath routing in wired networks
   need to evolve from MIMO routing.
   4.3.2 A Tree is a (Un)Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
   4.3.3 A Polytree (sort of a tree on top of a tree) is a DAG whose
   underlying undirected graph is a tree (Refer Figure 3).
   4.3.4 In order to design the Internet architecture the acyclic
   aspects of a Tree structure must be considered.
   4.3.5 DAG traversal can be performed in-order, pre-order,
   post-order and in-level.
   4.3.6 The IBGP full mesh is similar to a strongly connected
   component in a DAG.
   4.3.7 Critical path analysis is needed to enhance the Internet
   architecture.
   4.3.8 Features such as Transitive reduction and Critical path
   Analysis should resolve the Internet routing, congestion and
   convergence challenges.

   4.4 The Problem of Observability
   The above complexities of Computation, algorithms and connectedness
   are bounded by an AS. Thus all must be concurrently observed at
   multiple provider edge points on an AS to serve any purpose from a
   control plane perspective.
   Observability can be more clearly understood through the concept
   of a virtual state that is assumed to be occurring in Virtual BGP.
   This is similar to the BGP modes Read-only, Calculating best path,
   and Read and Write.

   5. Internet architecture based on the design considerations
   
   The significant traffic is controlled by BGP and Route
   reflectors. The flow of this significant traffic traverses a
   hierarchical tree structure through various tiers of the service
   provider network. Therefore it can be inferred that the traffic is
   flowing in top-down(north-south manner). In order to introduce
   parallelism (east-west traffic) for this significant traffic,
   Multipath TCP, dynamic path recalculation and re-routing by virtual
   redistribution(transit reduction) through RR clusters are feasible
   techniques. These techniques can be implemented within an AS. But
   due to the problem of Observability the analytical data needed for
   these techniques is present at the provider edges of the AS. Due to
   this point presence at various edges of an AS and the classful queue
   and algorithmic boundaries as described previously, a control plane
   in a separate address space is needed. The complex plane
   characteristics of the topological space indicates that the new
   address space needs to be a virtual address space.

   The virtual address space can facilitate pre-ordering of flows,
   pre-establishment of connections and pre-originating of routes. The
   virtual address space can also pre-classify QoS for the significant
   traffic.
   There is an implicit redundancy between distributed firewalls.
   This suggests that virtual redistribution is feasible. Virtual
   redistribution is a pre-origination and re-origination of a route as
   usually happens on an Area Border Router in OSPF. However in the
   IBGP Core the pre-origination and re-origination must occur at a
   Route Reflector through clusters. However the reorigination is for
   a route or a set of routes already present in the routing table to
   follow an alternate feasible path.

   However a major challenge exists at the boundary of the AS due to
   closure property.  There exists a boundary value problem or in other
   words the boundary between EBGP and IBGP needs to be analyzed as a
   closed set. Therefore a unique mapping is needed at each point that
   connects to the Virtual address space at the AS boundary. As the
   critical network information is at the boundary of the AS the
   virtual address space needs to connect to each AS boundary on at
   the most 2 to 3 points for each AS. The Data folds onto itself at
   the AS boundary.

   Thus by introducing virtual neighborship via virtual EBGP
   neighborship between local and global controllers and virtual IBGP
   neighborship within local and global controllers in the virtual
   address space the Internet can still retain its Open system
   characteristics. This circuvemtion of the closure property is by
   k-nearest neighbor algorithm. The local and global controllers are
   tightly coupled with the nearest neighbors as identified through the
   routing data set and loosely coupled with farthest neighbors. In
   this manner the Open system interconnection characteristic of the
   Internet is retained. By incorporating a local and global controller
   label in every IPv6 packet a routing data set can be computed at the
   Controllers which can dynamically detect which controllers are
   loosely coupled and which controllers are tightly coupled. The local
   and global controllers pairing and virtual EBGP neighborship
   segregates the virtual address space facilitating proper
   administrative control by different service providers.
   The virtual address space should only be utilized on a best effort
   basis for transit stability and peer to peer stability. Critical path
   analysis is mandatory. The virtual address space can facilitate a
   highly parallelized redundant traffic control system.  
   Implementation of the virtual neighborship through EBGP would
   require another address family. For convenience it can be called
   as Virtual address family. As the Virtual address space facilitates
   a highly parallelized traffic control system, Virtual neighborship
   needs redundancy between each node. This capability can be
   implemented through Multipath TCP, and BGP Multihop.

   6. IPv6 address assignment for the Virtual address space
   
   The IPv6 ULA address blocks match the requirements of the Virtual
   address space perfectly except that the address requirement is not
   for sites but within AS and between Service provider networks.
   fc00::/8 address block can be assigned for virtual EBGP sessions
   between Controllers as the block was also intended for global
   allocation.
   fd00::/8 address block can be assigned for virtual IBGP sessions
   within a Controller as the upper half (fd00::/8) is used for 
   "probabilistically unique" addresses in which the /8 prefix is
   combined with a 40-bit locally generated pseudorandom number to
   obtain a /48 private prefix. The way addresses in fd00::/8 are
   chosen, means that there is only a negligible chance that two AS
   that wish to merge or communicate with each other, will have
   conflicting ULA addresses.
   Additionally a local and global controller label must be present
   in every IPv6 packet a routing data set can be computed at the
   Controllers which can dynamically detect which controllers are
   loosely coupled and which controllers are tightly coupled.

   7. Glossary of terms and definitions:
   
   Node: A redistribution point having one or more Network interface
   cards with addresses.
   
   Host: A Computer is a node connected to a Computer network and
   assigned a network address.
   
   Abstract Machine: An abstract model of Computation used for
   analyzing the complexity of algorithms.
   
   MIMO Routing: Routing a cluster by cluster in each hop, where the
   number of nodes is larger or equal to one.
   
   Path Connected space: A path connected space is a stronger notion
   of connectedness. Every path connected space is connected. In a
   finite connected space a connected space is the same as path
   connected space.
   
   Transitive reduction: a transitive reduction of a directed graph D
   is another directed graph with the same vertices and as few edges
   as possible, such that if there is a (directed) path from vertex v
   to vertex w in D, then there is also such a path in the reduction. 
   
   The Von Neumann bottleneck(as described by John Backus):
   Surely there must be a less primitive way of making big changes in
   the store than by pushing vast numbers of words back and forth
   through the Von Neumann bottleneck. Not only is this tube a
   literal bottleneck for the data traffic of a problem, but, more
   importantly, it is an intellectual bottleneck that has kept us tied
   to word-at-a-time thinking instead of encouraging us to think in
   terms of the larger conceptual units of the task at hand. Thus,
   programming is basically planning and detailing the enormous traffic
   of word through the Von Neumann bottleneck, and much of that traffic
   concerns not significant data itself, but where to find it.

   8. Security Considerations
   A more robust security model can be built around the Virtual
   address space.

   9. IANA Considerations
   This document describes the need for IP address space
   reclassification
   
   10. Conclusions
   The IPv6 address space reclassification into a Physical address
   space and a Virtual address space is proposed. The mapping between
   these two occurs at the BGP AS Boundary. Together these two address
   spaces provide the ability to build an ideal Topological space for
   the Internet which facilitates a highly parallelized redundant
   traffic control system.
