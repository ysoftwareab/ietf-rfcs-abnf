1.  Overview

   Intelligence in the whole industry has a huge demand for computing,
   which put forwards immense challenges to cloud computing and network.
   Network Architecture is undergoing a transformation towards cloud and
   service, providing rapid response and flexible deployment for
   different industries.  The perfomance, function and management
   requirements of network's development need to be considered.

2.  Requirements of Network

   Computing in the network has some requirements of performance,
   function and management, to ensure the operation of future business
   and user experience.

2.1.  Performance requirement

2.1.1.  Precision

   Precision of the network refers to the deterministic of latency,
   packet loss rate and computing resource.

   The traditional network's best-effort forwarding mode can no longer
   meet the demand of such services for network latency.  The
   deterministic latency brings forward a new measure latitude for
   network, which changes from in-time to on-time.

   Packet loss rate is another factor to evaluate the precision of the
   network.  Utilizing the ubiquitous computing capability of the
   network, network prediction and segment-by-segment path
   retransmitting are realized based on AI, network transmission can be
   optimized and service QoS can be ensured.

   Besides those, how to precisely distribute network computing power to
   meet the requirements of business requests is also a challenge to the
   network.  It considers the network status and the performance status
   of computing resources to dynamic match the computing power.  So the
   user experience, utilization rate of computing resources and the
   network efficiency can be optimum.

   Some technologies such as time-sensitive network TSN, deterministic
   network DETNET, etc., have proposed corresponding technical means to
   provide network bearers with deterministic latency(IEEE802.1Qbv,
   IEEE802.1Qbu) and packet loss rate and guarantee the user's business
   experience.  However, it also needs to consider how to guarantee the
   service's end-to-end latency, packet loss rate and resource
   utilization rate.

2.1.2.  Concurrent

   In the network computing system, the number of computing nodes
   increases, so there is a lot of parallel computing needs between
   nodes, coupled with the trend of interconnection of everything in the
   future, it will bring great challenges to the network connection.

   Therefore, how to build and deploy these distributed computing nodes,
   ensure the processing capacity of the network element, and the
   storage and call capacity of the database are worth studying.

2.1.3.  Security

   Computing In network has brought the trend of network convergence in
   different regions.  For example, 5g network of operators can go deep
   into the vertical industry user site to provide users with higher
   quality network services, which will bring the convergence of
   operator's network and user site network.  Besides, industrial
   Internet brings the trend of integration of industrial OT network and
   IT network to further improve the production efficiency of the
   industry.  It need to ensure the security of the network, including
   the mutual trust and non aggression of information among regions,
   which may require further protection and detection measures.

2.2.  Function requirement

2.2.1.  Computing aware scheduling

   Computing in network needs a reasonable scheduling strategy, which
   means computing aware scheduling.  According to the business
   requests, dynamicly computing power matching is carried out based on
   network status and performance of computing resources to achieve
   optimal user experience, optimal utilization of computing resources
   and optimal network efficiency.  In computing aware scheduling,
   computing is seen as "link state" and the computing resource
   information should be exposed.

2.2.2.  Function based addressing

   Traditional application-based addressing can not accurately grasp the
   network performance in real time.  The comprehensive performance of
   addressing results based on application layer may not be the best,
   resulting in poor business experience.  In the function based
   addressing, the application deconstruction components on the server
   side are distributed on the cloud platform, and the business logic in
   the server is transferred to the client side.  So the client only
   needs to care about the computing function itself, not about the
   computing resources such as server, virtual machine, container and so
   on, so as to realize the function as a service.

2.2.3.  Network programmability

   Network programmability requires the network to configure parameters
   according to users' needs, such as the network requirements including
   bandwidth, latency and jitter , and computing requirements, such as
   CPU, storage and memory.  Users can transfer requirements based on
   network capabilities or states, like network resources and computing
   resources.  Thus it can effectively support future business
   requirements requiring high quality of service.

2.3.  Management requirement

2.3.1.  Cross domain management

   Computing in the network should guarantee the end-to-end network
   management to meet the needs of different network topology,
   performance and function, which involves cross domain network
   arrangement.  In the process of network data transmission, different
   services will be forwarded by different ways or different network
   protocols.  For example, in cross enterprise network construction,
   business requests from branches to headquarters may go through the
   VPN protocol of layer 2, and the routing protocol of layer 3.  The
   branches send business requests to the cloud, may go through the
   conversion from passive optical network to wavelength division
   multiplexing, etc.  It is necessary to realize the seamless
   connection of all levels of network transformation, ensure the end-
   to-end identifiability of business data flow, and provide a dedicated
   network for carrying and forwarding.

2.3.2.  Simple management

   Compared with the traditional network, computing in the network is a
   new architecture and system.  Scheduling and cooperation among
   different network domains, different operators and different users
   are very complex problems.  However, an effective management system
   is still needed to make the network capability and computing
   capability to cooperate with each other, and distribute the computing
   power reasonably.

3.  Conclusion

   In the new business requirements, the existing network technology can
   not meet the needs of transmission, computing and efficiency.  It
   need to meet the new network system requirements from the
   performance, function and management aspects, to ensure that the
   connectivity is everywhere, computing is everywhere, and intelligent
   support is everywhere.

4.  Security Considerations

   TBD.

5.  IANA Considerations

   TBD.
