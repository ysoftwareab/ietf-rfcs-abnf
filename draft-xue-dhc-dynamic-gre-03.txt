                      Dynamic Stateless GRE Tunnel
                      draft-xue-dhc-dynamic-gre-03

Abstract

   Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) is regarded as a popular
   encapsulation tunnel technology.  When a node tries to encapsulate
   the user traffic in GRE, it needs the IP address of the destination
   node which decapsulates the GRE packets.  In practice, the GRE tunnel
   destination IP address may be manually configured.  This
   configuration may introduce efficiency issues for operators.  This
   work proposes an approach to configure the GRE information
   dynamically.

1.  Introduction

   Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE, see [RFC1701] and [RFC2784]) is
   widely deployed in the operators' networks.  When a node tries to
   encapsulate the user traffic in a GRE tunnel, it needs the IP address
   of the destination node which can decapsulate the GRE packets.  In
   practice, the manual configuration happens on the nodes.  This may
   introduce efficiency issues for operators.  As an example, if GRE
   tunneling is used in the access network, there may a large amount of
   configuration needed at the access side.  This specification
   introduces a use case requiring the deployment of a large amount of
   GRE tunnels, which motivates a dynamic approach.  The specification
   proposes a solution to enable the dynamic discovery of the GRE
   decapsulation device through use of a Dynamic Host Configuration
   Protocol (DHCP) option.

2.  Terminology

   The following terms are used in this document:

   Access Controller (AC):  The network entity that provides Wireless
      Termination Point (WTP) access to the network infrastructure in
      the data plane, control plane, management plane, or a combination
      therein.

   Customer Premises Equipment (CPE):  The box that a provider may
      distribute to the customers.  When CPE is using DHCP to obtain
      network address, CPE is acting as "DHCP Client".

   Wireless Termination Point (WTP):  The physical or logical network
      entity that contains an RF antenna and wireless physical layer
      (PHY) to transmit and receive station traffic for wireless access
      networks.

3.  GRE Use Case - WLAN Network

   Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) has emerged as an important access
   technology for service operators.  A typical WLAN network contains a
   large number of WTPs, centrally managed and controlled by the Access
   Controller (AC).  It is desirable to distribute customer data frames
   to an endpoint through an Access Router (AR) different from the AC.
   GRE encapsulation can be used between a WTP and an AR as one of the
   optional tunneling technologies shown in
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-capwap-alt-tunnel].

   An illustration of a WLAN network is shown in Figure 1.  In order for
   a WTP to encapsulate the user traffic in a GRE tunnel, it needs to
   know the Access Router (AR) IP address.  This IP address is usually
   deployed on WTPs manually, which may introduce efficiency issues for
   operators.  An AC may dynamically configure the WTP with the AR
   address via extended CAPWAP message elements (see
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-capwap-alt-tunnel]).  However, this approach does
   not apply to a WLAN network where the CAPWAP protocol is not
   deployed, as the network shown in Figure 2.  In fact, it is quite
   common for operators to have their own private control plane between
   the WTP and the AC rather than CAPWAP.  Moreover, there are also WLAN
   deployments without AC, as in the FAT WTPs scenario (see Figure 3).
   A general approach to resolve this problem is desirable.

                       Figure 8: Dynamic GRE Tunnel

   The steps to set up a GRE tunnel between the CPE and the AR are as
   follows:

   1.  The CPE, as one endpoint of GRE tunnel, sends the DHCP request
       message to the DHCP server to acquire the AR access.  The GRE
       Discovery DHCP Option should be included, with AR IPv4 address
       set to zero.  When the DHCP server receives this request, it
       replies to the CPE the DHCP Reply message, containing the AR
       address and the tunnel information if needed.

   2.  The CPE can encapsulate the upstream packets from the hosts
       within GRE packets.  Generally, upstream packets are either data
       packets or control packets.  When the AR gets an encapsulated GRE
       packet, the AR checks whether there is an existing GRE tunnel

       with the CPE.  If this is a new endpoint without GRE record, the
       AR should add this CPE into the tunnel client list.

   3.  A keepalive mechanism may be required for a GRE tunnel between
       the CPE and the AR.  If there is neither keepalive packet nor
       data packet, when a keepalive timer expires, the AR or the CPE
       will tear down the tunnel and release resources.
