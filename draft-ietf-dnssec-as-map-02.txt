INTERNET-DRAFT                         Mapping A.S. Numbers into the DNS


Abstract

   One requirement of secure routing is that independent routing
   entities, such as those identified by Internet Autonomous System
   Numbers, be able to authenticate messages to each other.
   Modifications currently being developed (see draft-ietf-dnssec-
   secext-*.txt) to the Domain Name System will enable it to be used for
   authenticated public key distribution.  This draft maps all
   Autonomous System numbers into DNS Domain Names so that the DNS can
   be used to distribute their public keys.

INTERNET-DRAFT                         Mapping A.S. Numbers into the DNS


1. Introduction

   There are a number of elements that will be required to secure
   routing in the Internet.  One of these is a way that independently
   operated top level routing domains be able to authenticate messages
   to each other.

   Sharing a private symmetric key between each pair of such domains is
   impractical.  The Autonomous System numbering scheme provides for
   2**16 such domains which implies approximately 2**31 pairs, an
   impractical number of keys to securely generate, install, and
   periodically replace.

   The solution is to use public key technology whereby each domain has
   a private key it can use to sign messages.  Other domains that know
   the corresponding public key can then authenticate these messages.
   Such authenticated messages can be used to set up and maintain
   efficient symmetric keys on an as needed basis.

   But how do the domains securely obtain the Autonomous System number
   to public key mapping?

   Extensions currently being developed for the Domain Name System will
   enable it to be conveniently used for authenticated public key
   distribution (see draft-ietf-dnssec-secext-*.txt). A variety of key
   types is supported.  All that is required is a mapping of Autonomous
   System numbers into domain names, which is provided by this draft.

   It should be noted that the public keys retrieved from DNS will
   likely be used primarily to authenticate initial connection set up
   messages.  Autonomous Systems that need to converse with any
   frequency will probably negotiate more efficient session keys.

2. Autonomous System Number Mapping

   Autonomous System (A.S.) numbers are 16 bit quantities, usually
   written as decimal number whose maximum value would be 65,535.  For
   example, ANS is autonomous system 690.  The A.S. number is mapped
   into a domain name as described below.

   Take the thousands part of the A.S. number and the number modulo
   1,000 as decimal numbers, reverse their order and put a period
   between them, and then append ".in-as.arpa".  This mapping is
   analogous to the IPv4 address mapping into the in-addr.arpa DNS
   domain.

   Thus the domain name correspond to Autonomous System 690 (decimal) is

        690.0.in-as.arpa.

   and the domain corresponding to the largest possible A.S. number is

        535.65.in-as.arpa.

3. Meaning of RRs

   The following guidance is given for some RR types that could be
   stored under the names mapped from A.S. numbers.  The KEY RR is given
   first, followed by the SIG RR, the NXT RR, and then some additional
   RR types in alphabetic order.

        KEY: This type of resource record associates a public key with
   the Autonomous System (A.S.) designated by its name.  Such a public
   key can be used to authenticate communications with or between A.S.s.
   The existence of KEY RRs in the reason for mapping A.S. names into
   the DNS.  Under DNS security as proposed in draft-ietf-dnssec-
   secext-*.txt the KEY RR can be used to store a variety of digital
   keys.

        SIG: The SIG signature resource record authenticates the RRs
   that it signs as described in draft-ietf-dnssec-secext-*.txt.
   Assuming the signer who generated the SIG is trustworthy, such as the
   in-as.arpa zone owner, then the signed RRs can be trusted.

        NXT: An NXT RR is used in DNS security to provide authenticated
   denial of the existence of types and names as described in draft-
   ietf-dnssec-secext-*.txt.

        A: DO NOT place type A RRs at A.S. nodes.  A.S. domain names are
   reserved for Autonomous Systems only and should NOT be used for a
   host or any type of end entity other than an Autonomous System.

        CNAME: This type of RR is an alias pointing to another domain
   name.  An A.S. could have a CNAME pointing to a different A.S. but
   this is not likely to be very useful as A.S. RRs will normally be
   looked up when the A.S. number is actually encountered in use.

        MX: There is no special use for an MX RR for an A.S. name.  It
   could point to a host that would accept mail related to that A.S.

        NS: The presence of NS records under an in-as.arpa name means
   that it has been carved out as a subzone.  This gives the A.S.
   complete control over the zone refresh parameters and control over
   the creation of inferior names.  No special meaning is currently
   assigned to such inferior names so, although this is not advised,
   they could be used for hosts or whatever.

        PTR: The part of the forward domain tree that administratively
   corresponds to the A.S. should be indicated by a PTR RR.  It some
   entity, say example.net, has several A.S.s, there would be PTRs to
   example.net from several names in the in-as.arpa hierarchy.

        RP: A Responsible Person RR SHOULD appear under each A.S. name
   telling you who you should contact in the case of problems with that

        TXT: Text RRs can be used for comments, postal address, or
   similar notes under an A.S. name.

4. Security Considerations

   The entirety of this document concerns a means to map Internet
   Autonomous System numbers into the Domain Name System (DNS) so that
   DNS can be used to provide secure distribution of Autonomous System's
   public keys.
