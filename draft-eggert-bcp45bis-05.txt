Abstract

   The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) discussion mailing list
   furthers the development and specification of Internet technology

   mailing lists exists.  As this is the most general IETF mailing list,
   considerable latitude is allowed, but there are posts and topics that
   are unsuitable for this mailing list.

   This document obsoletes RFC3005.

Internet-Draft        IETF Discussion List Charter        September 2021


1.  Introduction

   The IETF discussion list [IETF-DISCUSS] furthers the development and
   specification of Internet technology through the general discussion
   of topics for which no dedicated mailing lists exists.  As this is
   the most general IETF mailing list, considerable latitude is allowed.
   However, there are posts and topics that are unsuitable for this
   mailing list.  This document defines the charter for the IETF
   discussion list and explains its scope.

   The IETF Note Well [NOTE-WELL] applies to discussions on the IETF
   discussion list and all other IETF mailing lists, and requires
   conformance with the IETF Guidelines for Conduct [RFC7154] and the
   Anti-Harassment Policy [IETF-AHP], among others.

2.  Charter for the IETF Discussion List

   The IETF discussion list is meant for discussions for which a more
   appropriate list does not exist, such as discussions that do not fall
   within the area of any working group, area or other established list.
   When discussions are started on the IETF discussion list for which
   such venues do exist, they should be continued there as soon as this
   is pointed out.

   When no dedicated mailing list exists, it may be preferable to
   request the creation of one [NON-WG-LISTS] and only announce the
   availability of the new list on the IETF discussion list and on other
   related lists, such as area lists.

   Appropriate postings to the IETF discussion list include:

   *  Initial discussion of technical issues that are candidates for
      IETF work, but have not yet identified appropriate mailing lists.

   *  Questions and clarifications concerning practical aspects of IETF
      meetings, although most of these topics are better brought up on
      the discussion list for IETF LLC administrative issues
      [ADMIN-DISCUSS] or the attendee discussion list for a given IETF
      meeting.

   *  Announcements of conferences, events, or activities that are
      sponsored or endorsed by the Internet Society or the IETF,
      although the IETF announcement list [IETF-ANNOUNCE] is the
      preferred list for these.

   These topics used to be in scope for the IETF discussion list, but
   have since moved to dedicated lists:

Internet-Draft        IETF Discussion List Charter        September 2021


   *  Last Call discussions of proposed document actions now take place
      on the IETF Last Calls mailing list [LAST-CALLS].

   *  Discussion of IETF administrative policies now take place on the
      discussion list for IETF LLC administrative issues
      [ADMIN-DISCUSS].

   Inappropriate postings include:

   *  Advertising and other unsolicited bulk e-mail

   *  Discussion of subjects unrelated to IETF policy, meetings,
      activities, or technical topics

   *  Unprofessional commentary, regardless of the general subject

   *  Announcements of conferences, events, or activities that are not
      sponsored or endorsed by the Internet Society or the IETF.

3.  Moderation

   A sergeant-at-arms (SAA) "is an officer appointed by a deliberative
   body (...) to keep order during its meetings" [SAA-WIKIPEDIA].  SAAs
   for the IETF discussion list are appointed by the IETF Chair and are
   empowered to restrict posting by a person, or of a thread, when the
   content is inappropriate and represents a pattern of abuse.  They are
   encouraged to take into account the overall nature of the postings by
   an individual and whether particular postings are an aberration or
   typical.

   The SAAs are intended to establish a self-moderation function on the
   community, by the community.  The IETF Chair therefore should not
   appoint an SAA who is serving in a NomCom-appointed IETF leadership
   position.  If an SAA is selected for such a position, they will step
   down as SAA.

   Apart from appointing SAAs, the IETF Chair should stay away from the
   day-to-day operation and management of the SAA team.  This has been
   in practice for a while, and the SAA team has independently
   maintained definitions of abuse patterns [SAA-UPC] and operating
   procedures [SAA-SOP] for them.  The SAA team should reach out to the
   IETF Chair for any conflict resolution in a timely manner.

   Because an SAA serves at the discretion of the IETF Chair - even if
   the IETF Chair is not otherwise involved in the operation of the SAA
   team - any SAA decision can be appealed to the IETF Chair, per
   [RFC2026].  Decisions by the IETF Chair can be appealed to the IESG
   as whole, again per [RFC2026].
