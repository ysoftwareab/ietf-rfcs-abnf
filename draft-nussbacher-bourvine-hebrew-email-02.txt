Abstract

  This document describes the  encoding  used  in  electronic  mail  for
  transferring Hebrew over the Internet.

introduction

  Hebrew needs special treatment while being sent inside electronic mail
  due to the following reasons:
  - The Hebrew character set commonly used today  is  using  the  "upper
    half"  of  the  ASCII  table, thus the correct character set must be
    specified for the text to be rendered correctly.
  - Since Hebrew is  written  right-to-left  a  directionality  must  be
    specified, so the text is displayed correctly and not reversed.

  This memo is based on the Israeli standard IS-1904 and  is  compatible
  with it.  This memo makes use of MIME [RFC2045] and ISO-8859-8.

  This document replaces the specification of  RFC  1555.   The  default
  directionality  in  a  composed Hebrew message was changed to Implicit
  from Visual, and a receiving entity needs to  understand  both  visual
  and  implicit  messages.  Explicit directionality has been removed, as
  it was never used.

Requirements Terminology

  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",  "SHALL",  "SHALL  NOT",
  "SHOULD",  "SHOULD  NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
  document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

Description

  All Hebrew text when transferred via e-mail MUST first  be  translated
  into  ISO-8859-8,  and  then  encoded  using  either  Quoted-Printable
  (preferable) or Base64, as defined in MIME.

  The following table provides the four most  common  Hebrew  encodings;
  the ISO-8859-8 is the dominating encoding while the others might still
  be used on few old legacy systems.

  Note:  All values are in decimal ASCII except for  the  EBCDIC  column
  which is in hexadecimal.

  The default directionality of the text is  logical  (implicit).   This
  means  that the Hebrew text is encoded according to the directionality
  of the involved characters, and is trasmitted in the same order  as  a
  person   would   type   the  stated  text.   The  methods  to  control
  directionality are supported and are covered in the complementary  RFC
  1556,  "Handling of Bi-directional Texts in MIME".  The algorithm used
  to convert from logical directionality to visual is the  Unicode  one.
  This  algorithm  is  used  to  reformat  the  text for displaying on a
  non-Hebrew aware terminal.

  All discussion regarding Hebrew in email, as well  as  discussions  of
  Hebrew   in   other  TCP/IP  protocols,  is  discussed  in  the  ilan-
  h@vm.tau.ac.il list.  To subscribe send mail to  listserv@vm.tau.ac.il
  with one line of text as follows:

                   subscribe ilan-h firstname lastname

Character set

  Due to the lack of directionality field in MIME headers it was decided
  to  superimpose  the directionality over the character set.  Thus, the
  following character sets are available:

            ISO-8859-8 for visual directionality
            ISO-8858-8-i for implicit (logical) directionality.

MIME Considerations

  Mail that is sent that contains Hebrew SHOULD  contain  the  following
  minimum amount of MIME headers:

            MIME-Version:  1.0
            Content-type:  text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-8-i
            Content-transfer-encoding:  BASE64 | Quoted-Printable

  Users SHOULD keep their text to within 72 columns so as to allow email
  quoting  via the prefixing of each line with a ">".  Users SHOULD also
  realize  that  not  all  MIME  implementations  handle  email  quoting
  properly,  so  quoting  email  that  contains  Hebrew text may lead to
  problems.
  In the future, when all email systems implement fully  transparent  8-
  bit email as defined in STD0010 and RFC 1652 this standard will become
  partially  obsolete.   The  "Content-type:"  field   will   still   be
  necessary,  as  well  as  directionality  (which might be implicit for
  8BIT, but is something  for  future  discussion),  but  the  "Content-


                                - 3 -

  transfer-encoding"  will  be altered to use 8BIT rather than Base64 or
  Quoted-Printable.

Optional

  It is RECOMMENDED, although NOT REQUIRED, to support  Hebrew  encoding
  in   mail  headers  as  specified  in  RFC  2047.   Specifically,  the
  Q-encoding format is to be the default method used for encoding Hebrew
  in Internet mail headers and not the B-encoding method.

Conformance

  A conforming sender MUST use Logical order (charset=ISO-8858-8-i).   A
  conforming  receiver  MUST  be  able  to properly decode logical order
  (charset=ISO-8859-8-i) encoding and SHOULD be able to properly  decode
  visual order encoding (charset=ISO-8859-8).  The latter is for support
  older software which implemented RFC-1555 visual mode.

Caveats

  Within Israel there are in excess of 40 Listserv lists which will  now
  start  using  Hebrew  for  part  of  their  conversations.   Normally,
  Listserv will deliver mail from a distribution list with a "shortened"
  header,  one  that does not include the extra MIME headers.  This will
  cause the MIME encoding to be left intact and the user agent  decoding
  software will not be able to interpret the mail.  Each user is able to
  customize how Listserv delivers mail.  For lists that contain  Hebrew,
  users SHOULD send mail to Listserv with the following command:

                            set listname full

  where listname is the name of the list  which  the  user  wants  full,
  unabridged  headers  to  appear.  This will update their private entry
  and all subsequent mail from  that  list  will  be  with  full  RFC822
  headers, including MIME headers.

  In addition, Listserv usually  maintains  automatic  archives  of  all
  postings  to  a list.  These archives, contained in the file "listname
  LOGyymm", do not contain the MIME headers, so all encoding information
  will be lost.  This is a limitation of the Listserv software.


Example

  Below is a short example of Quoted-Printable encoded Hebrew email:

     From:         Hank Nussbacher <HANK@VM.BIU.AC.IL>
     Subject:      Sample Hebrew mail
     To:           Hank Nussbacher <Hank@BARILVM>,
                   Yehavi Bourvine <yehavi@hujivms>
     MIME-Version: 1.0

  There are no security issues which are directly related to this  memo.
  However,  users  SHOULD  notice  that  if  one  mixes Hebrew and ASCII
  characters in a message, there are multiple messages that will display
  on screen in the same way.  Although this is not believed to raise any
  serious security issue, users  SHOULD  be  aware  of  it  in  case  of
  sensitive or ambigous issues.
