Abstract

   For debugging, it is often helpful to have information about the
   implementation of a peer.  The present specification defines a link
   relation type, "impl-info", that can be used to convey such
   information via self-description, such as in the "/.well-known/core"
   resource.

1.  Introduction

   When debugging an interoperability problem, it is often helpful to
   have information about the implementation version of a peer.  To
   enable the disclosure of such information, HTTP defines header fields
   such as Server and User-Agent [RFC7231].

   In CoAP [RFC7252], it is rarely appropriate to send information of
   this kind in every request or response.  Instead, the present
   specification defines a link relation type, "impl-info", that can be
   used to convey this information via the self-description capabilities
   of the /.well-known/core resource [RFC6690] and the CoRE resource
   directory [I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory].

2.  IANA Considerations

   This specification requests the registration of the link relation
   type "impl-info".

   The registration template as per [RFC8288] follows.

   *  _Relation Name_: "impl-info"

   *  _Description_: Refers to implementation information that may be
      helpful in diagnosing technical problems with the implementation
      of the context, such as lists of components and their
      implementation versions.

   *  _Reference_: [THIS]

3.  Security considerations

   The security considerations listed in Section 9.6 of [RFC7231] and
   the sections referenced there apply.

   The security considerations listed in Section 11.3 of [RFC7252]
   apply.  As adding another link to "/.well-known/core" does increase

   the size of a response to a GET request for that resource, the
   mitigation mentioned in that section to limit the amplification
   factor becomes even more important.

   Disclosing information about an implementation can make it easier for
   an attacker to select an attack, or to build automated tools that
   search for promising victims.  Fingerprinting techniques can provide
   information to attackers that is usable in the same way, so adding
   information via self-description may or may not actually exacerbate
   this problem.

Acknowledgements

   The need for implementation information in the CoRE resource
   directory has been identified by Peter van der Stok.  Discussions
   with Peter and with Christian Amsüss (U+0043 U+0068 U+0072 U+0069
   U+0073 U+0074 U+0069 U+0061 U+006E U+0020 U+0041 U+006D U+0073 U+00FC
   U+0073 U+0073) led to the present proposal of employing self-
   description for this purpose.
