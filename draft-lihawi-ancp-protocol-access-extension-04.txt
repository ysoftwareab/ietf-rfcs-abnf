1.  Introduction

   RFC6934 introduces application of ANCP to PON.  However, RFC6320
   [RFC6320] haven't been updated to support PON.  Besides, DSL
   technology is also evolving.  G.fast, VDSL2 Vectoring and VDSL2 Annex
   Q were introduced as upgraded versions to provide higher bandwidths
   for the last mile..

   This document considers all existing Access technologies used in a
   Telco network, yet not supported by RFC6320 and specifies new TLVs
   accordingly.

2.  Terminology

   This section repeats some definitions from RFC6320 and RFC6934
   [RFC6934], but also updates some definitions where appropriate.

   Access Node (AN): [RFC5851] Network device, usually located at a
   service provider central office or street cabinet that terminates
   access (local) loop connections from subscribers.  In case the access
   loop is a Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), the Access Node provides DSL
   signal termination and is referred to as a DSL Access Multiplexer
   (DSLAM).  In case the access loop is a Passive Optical Network (PON),
   the Access Node is referred to as an Optical Line Terminal (OLT).

   Optical Line Terminal (OLT): is located in the service provider's
   central office (CO) or street cabinet.  It terminates and aggregates
   multiple PONs (providing fiber access to multiple premises or
   neighborhoods) on the subscriber side and interfaces with the Network
   Access Server (NAS) that provides subscriber management.

   Optical Network Terminal (ONT): terminates PON on the network side
   and provides PON adaptation.  The subscriber side interface and the
   location of the ONT are dictated by the type of network deployment.
   For an FTTP deployment (with fiber all the way to the apartment or
   living unit), ONT has Ethernet (Fast Ethernet (FE) / Gigabit Ethernet
   (GE) / Multimedia over Coax Alliance (MoCA)) connectivity with the
   Home Gateway (HGW) / Customer Premises Equipment (CPE).  In certain
   cases, one ONT may provide connections to more than one Home Gateway
   at the same time.

   Optical Network Unit (ONU): a generic term denoting a device that
   terminates any one of the distributed (leaf) endpoints of an Optical
   Distribution Network (ODN), implements a PON protocol, and adapts PON
   PDUs to subscriber service interfaces.  In the case of a multi-

   dwelling unit (MDU) or multi-tenant unit (MTU), a multi-subscriber
   ONU typically resides in the basement or a wiring closet (FTTB case)
   and has FE/GE/Ethernet over native Ethernet link or over xDSL
   (typically VDSL2) connectivity with each CPE at the subscriber
   premises.  In the case where fiber is terminated outside the premises
   (neighborhood or curb side) on an ONT/ONU, the last-leg-premises
   connections could be via existing or new copper, with xDSL physical
   layer (typically VDSL2).  In this case, the ONU effectively is a
   "PON-fed DSLAM".  In new FTTdp based deployments the access node is
   named DPU (Distribution Point Unit).  Basically from ANCP perspective
   this node provides the same functionality.  Besides VDSL2, G.fast is
   beginning to play an important role.

3.  Modification to ANCP - General Aspects

   ANCP message formats remain the same as described in section 3.5.1 of
   RFC6320 when it is applied to PON.  However, some message
   descriptions need to be modified to make them applicable to variant
   Access Networks, other than DSL specific.

   The ANCP Adjacency message is extended to other Access Technologies
   than DSL.  Generalize the message format to following:

   The following capabilities are defined for ANCP:

   o Capability Type: Access Topology Discovery = 0x01

      Access technology: ANY

      Length (in bytes): 0

      Capability Data: NULL

   For the detailed protocol specification of this capability, see
   Section 6 of RFC6320.

   o Capability Type: Access Line Configuration = 0x02

      Access technology: ANY

      Length (in bytes): 0

      Capability Data: NULL

   For the detailed protocol specification of this capability, see
   Section 7 of RFC6320.

   o Capability Type: Access Remote Line Connectivity Testing = 0x04

      Capability Data: NULL

   For the detailed protocol specification of this capability, see
   Section 8 of RFC6320.

4.  Modification to DSL-Type TLV 0x0091

   Add following new DSL-Type values.

   Value: 32-bit unsigned integer

      G.fast = 8

      VDSL2 Annex Q = 9

      SDSL bonded = 10

      VDSL2 bonded = 11

      G.fast bonded = 12

      VDSL2 Annex Q bonded = 13

5.  Extension to DSL Sub TLV

   DSL sub TLVs are listed in Section 6.5 of RFC6320.  G.Fast requires
   beside existing TLVs the following new TLVs.

   The format of the ANCP Port Up and Port Down Event messages is shown
   in Figure xx1.  It has the same format as the one described in
   section 6.3 of RFC6320.  The only difference is that DSL-Line-
   Attributes TLV is updated as Access-Line-Attributes TLV.

      Format of the ANCP Port Up and Port Down Event Messages for PON
                            Topology Discovery

   NOTE: TLVs MAY be in a different order from what is shown in this
   figure.

   Figure xx1: Format of the ANCP Port Up and Port Down Event Messages
   for PON Topology Discovery

   See Section 3.6.1 of RFC6320 for a description of the ANCP general
   message header.  The Message Type field MUST be set to 80 for Port
   Up, 81 for Port Down.  It is applicable to both DSL and PON based
   access systems.  The 4-bit Result field MUST be set to zero
   (signifying Ignore).  The 12-bit Result Code field and the 24-bit
   Transaction Identifier field MUST also be set to zeroes.  Other
   fields in the general header MUST be set a as described in
   Section 3.6 of RFC6320.

   The five-word Unused field is a historical leftover.  The handling of
   unused/reserved fields is described in Section 3.4 of RFC6320.

   The remaining message fields belong to the "extension block", and are
   described as follows:

   Extension Flags (8 bits): The flag bits denoted by 'x' are currently
   unspecified and reserved.

   Message Type (8 bits): Message Type has the same value as in the
   general header (i.e., 80 or 81).

   Tech Type (8 bits): MUST be set to 0x01 (PON).

   Reserved (8 bits): set as described in Section 3.4 of RFC6320.

   # of TLVs (16 bits): The number of TLVs that follow, not counting
   TLVs encapsulated within other TLVs.

   Extension Block Length (16 bits): The total length of the TLVs
   carried in the extension block in bytes, including any padding within
   individual TLVs.

   TLVs: One or more TLVs to identify a PON Access line and zero or more
   TLVs to define its characteristics.

6.2.  PON Access Line Identification

   Most ANCP messages involve actions relating to a specific access
   line.  Thus, it is necessary to describe how PON access lines are
   identified within those messages.  This section defines four TLVs for
   that purpose and provides an informative description of how they are
   used in PON.  TLVs not addressed here remain unchanged as applied for
   DSL.

6.2.1.  Access-Loop-Circuit-ID TLV

   Type: 0x0001

   Description: A locally administered human-readable string generated
   by or configured on the Access Node, uniquely identifying the
   corresponding access loop logical port on the user side of the Access
   Node, as described in Section 5.7 of [TR-156]..

   Length: Up to 63 bytes

   Value: ASCII string

6.2.2.  Access-Loop-Remote-ID TLV

   Type: 0x0002

   Description: An operator-configured string that uniquely identifies
   the user on the associated access line, as described in Section 5.7
   of [TR-156].

   Length: Up to 63 bytes

   Value: ASCII string

6.3.  TLVs for PON Access Line Attributes

6.3.1.  PON-Access-Line-Attributes TLV

   Type: 0x0012

   Description: This TLV encapsulates attribute values of a PON access
   line serving a subscriber.

   Length: Variable (up to 1023 bytes)

   Value: One or more encapsulated TLVs corresponding to PON access line
   attributes.  The PON-Access-Line-Attributes TLV MUST contain at least
   one TLV when it is present in a Port Up or Port Down message.  The
   actual contents are determined by the AN control application.
   Technology-independent attributes of RFC6320, such as TLV0x0090, are
   valid for PON and not repeated here.

6.3.2.  PON-Access-Type TLV

   Type: 0x0097

   Description: Indicates the type of PON transmission system in use.

   Length: 4 bytes

   Value: 32-bit unsigned integer

      OTHER = 0

      GPON = 1

      XG-PON1 = 2

      TWDM-PON = 3

   Length: 4 bytes

   Value: Rate in kbits/s as a 32-bit unsigned integer

6.3.4.  ONT/ONU-Peak-Data-Rate-Downstream TLV
