Internet-Draft              IANA SRV registry               October 2008


Abstract

   DNS SRV record was specified in RFC2052 and RFC2782.  These two RFC
   did not specify an IANA registry for names of the protocols using SRV
   records.  This document creates such a registry.

1.  Introduction

   SRV record was introduced in RFC2052 [RFC2052] an experimental
   extension, it proved highly valuable addition to the DNS to be used
   for service location and provisioning.  SRV record was thus
   standardized in RFC2782 [RFC2782].  The main difference between the
   versions is the use of the "_" prefix character in names to avoid
   naming conflicts between service names and regular names.

   The SRV record has a recommended naming structure for its use:

   _service._Proto.name SRV priority weight PORT Target

   The "_Proto" field is the name of the transport protocol to be used,
   the "_service" name on the other hand is a name of the Service/
   Application that is being offered.  "Name" is the domain name that is
   offering the service.  The PORT field is the port number the service
   is provide at the Target name.  The priority and weight fields are
   used for selecting among multiple SRV records.

   RFC2782 says that the source of names of "services" is "Assigned
   names" and cites document STD2.  STD2 series was obsoleted by RFC3232
   [RFC3232] and registration services was handed over to on-line
   registries maintained by IANA.  Unfortunately it is not explicitly
   explained in RFC2782 which section of STD2 it is referring nor does
   RFC3232 help.  By common knowledge the corresponding IANA registry's
   are the two "Port Numbers" registries.

   Upon reflection it does not seem to make sense to have a registered
   port number for a service that is going to be looked up via SRV
   record.  As the SRV record contains the port at where each server
   provides the service.  The number of ports available is small
   compared to the possible names that can be registered.  For these
   reasons this document creates a separate registry that is only for
   SRV services.  This explicitly removes the constraint that services
   need a port number registrations.  The registration requirement for
   this new registry as set low as to make it relatively easy to
   register a new name.

   To large extent the requirement to register port numbers can be
   eliminated by encouraging SRV use in all new application protocols.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].

2.  SRV registry considerations

   Registering a new service should be easy and painless process, but
   registering a new transport protocol should be hard.  For service a
   pointer to specification is optional, but required for transportation
   protocol.

2.1.  To _ or not to _

   The original SRV RFC used regular DNS names for service and transport
   names, this was shown to cause some name conflicts.  For example it
   is impossilbe to have the name "TCP" delegation and also provide a
   service on http.tcp.  For this reason the current SRV RFC specifies
   the use of "_" in front of all names both transports and services.
   The argument for following this nomenclature for transports is clear
   and needed.  On the other hand having a full DNS name space created
   on the left of each transport name, the argument for same
   namecollision in the services does not apply.  While arguments that
   the pressence of the "_" character make it easier to spot this is a
   service are not convincing.

2.2.  Regular expression in service registrations

   There are cases were a registrant may want to register a collection
   of names that are followed an pattern.  Instances like "my-updates-
   21yy" or "Producer-model_number".  In the first case the registration
   would be for "My-updates-21[0-9][0-9]" and in the second case
   "Producer-.+".  These registrations should be as specific as possible
   avoiding cases like "http.+" that collides with https.  If a regular
   expression in a requiest collides with an existing string then it
   should be rejected.  Only registrations with regular expressions at
   the end of the string are allowed.

2.3.  Name collisions in service registrations

   As this document allows registrations of NEW services without the the
   "_" prefix, these registrations MUST NOT collide with pre-existing
   registrations that start with the prefix "_".  Further more to
   provide grace period where existing names can be registered, for one
   calendar year after this document is published as an RFC no
   registrations without "_" will be accepted.

6.  IANA considerations

   This document creates a new IANA registry with 2 sub registries.  The
   registry is named "DNS SRV protocol strings".  Policy for creating in
   sub-registries is "IETF consensus".

   First sub-registry is: "DNS SRV transport protocol names" Allocation
   policy is "IETF consensus" Initial Contents of the registry are in
   section 3.

   Second sub-registry is: "SRV Application identifiers" Allocation
   policy is "First Come First Served".  Rules for registration names
   are in section 4.  Template for registrations is in section 4.1, IANA
   will archive and make available all accepted registrations via links
   from the registry.  Initial contents of the registry is in section
   4.2
