1.  Introduction

   This document presents advice on the design choices that arise when
   designing IPv6 networks (both dual-stack and IPv6-only).  The
   intended audience is someone designing an IPv6 network who is
   knowledgeable about best current practices around IPv4 network
   design, and wishes to learn the corresponding practices for IPv6.

   The focus of the document is on design choices where there are
   differences between IPv4 and IPv6, either in the range of possible
   alternatives (e.g. the extra possibilities introduced by link-local
   addresses in IPv6) or the recommended alternative.  The document
   presents the alternatives and discusses the pros and cons in detail.
   Where consensus currently exists around the best practice, this is
   documented; otherwise the document simply summarizes the current
   state of the discussion.  Thus this document serves to both to
   document the reasoning behind best current practices for IPv6, and to
   allow a designer to make an intelligent choice where no such
   consensus exists.

   This document does not present advice on strategies for adding IPv6
   to a network, nor does it discuss transition mechanisms.  For advice
   in these areas, see [RFC6180] for general advice, [RFC6782] for
   wireline service providers, [RFC6342] for mobile network providers,
   [RFC5963] for exchange point operators, [RFC6883] for content
   providers, and both [RFC4852] and
   [I-D.ietf-v6ops-enterprise-incremental-ipv6] for enterprises.  Nor
   does the document cover the ins and outs of creating an IPv6
   addressing plan; for advice in this area, see [RFC5375].

   This document focuses on unicast network design only.  It does not
   cover multicast, nor supporting infrastructure such as DNS.

   The current version is still work in progress, and it is expected
   that the presentation and discussion of additional design choices
   will be added as the document matures.

2.  Design Choices

   This section consists of a list of specific design choices a network
   designer faces when designing an IPv6-only or dual-stack network,
   along with guidance and advice to the designer when making a choice.

2.1.  Links

2.1.1.  Mix IPv4 and IPv6 on the Same Link?

   Should IPv4 and IPv6 traffic be logically separated on a link?  That
   is:

   a.  Mix IPv4 and IPv6 traffic on the same layer 2 connection, OR

   b.  Separate IPv4 and IPv6 by using separate physical or logical
       links (e.g., two physical links or two VLANs on the same link)?

   Option (a) implies a single layer 3 interface at each end with both
   IPv4 and IPv6 addresses; while option (b) implies two layer 3
   interfaces, one for IPv4 addresses and one with IPv6 addresses.

   The advantages of option (a) include:

   o  Requires only half as many layer 3 interfaces as option (b), thus
      providing better scaling;

   o  May require fewer physical ports, thus saving money;






Matthews & Kuarsingh     Expires March 22, 2015                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft             IPv6 Design Choices            September 2014


   o  Can make the QoS implementation much easier (for example, rate-
      limiting the combined IPv4 and IPv6 traffic to or from a
      customer);

   o  Works well in practice, as any increase in IPv6 traffic is usually
      counter-balanced by a corresponding decrease in IPv4 traffic to or
      from the same host (ignoring the common pattern of an overall
      increase in Internet usage);

   o  And is generally conceptually simpler.

   For these reasons, there is a pretty strong consensus in the operator
   community that option (a) is the preferred way to go.  Most networks
   today use option (a) wherever possible.

   However, there can be times when option (b) is the pragmatic choice.
   Most commonly, option (b) is used to work around limitations in
   network equipment.  One big example is the generally poor level of
   support today for individual statistics on IPv4 traffic vs IPv6
   traffic when option (a) is used.  Other, device-specific, limitations
   exist as well.  It is expected that these limitations will go away as
   support for IPv6 matures, making option (b) less and less attractive
   until the day that IPv4 is finally turned off.

2.1.2.  Links with Only Link-Local Addresses?

   Should the link:

   a.  Use only link-local addresses ("unnumbered"), OR

   b.  Have global or unique-local addresses assigned in addition to
       link-locals?

   There are two advantages of unnumbered links.  The first advantage is
   ease of configuration.  In a network with a large number of
   unnumbered links, the operator can just enable an IGP on each router,
   without going through the tedious process of assigning and tracking
   the addresses for each link.  The second advantage is security.
   Since link-local addresses are unroutable, the associated interfaces
   cannot be attacked from an off-link device.  This implies less effort
   around maintaining security ACLs.

   Countering this advantage are various disadvantages to unnumbered
   links in IPv6:

   o  It is not possible to ping an interface that has only a link-local
      address from a device that is not directly attached to the link.
      Thus, to troubleshoot, one must typically log into a device that



Matthews & Kuarsingh     Expires March 22, 2015                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft             IPv6 Design Choices            September 2014


      is directly attached to the device in question, and execute the
      ping from there.

   o  A traceroute passing over the unnumbered link will return the
      loopback or system address of the router, rather than the address
      of the interface itself.

   o  In cases of parallel point to point links it is difficult to
      determine which of the parallel links was taken when attempting to
      troubleshoot unless one sends packets directly between the two
      attached link-locals on the specific interfaces.  Since many
      network problems behave differently for traffic to/from a router
      than for traffic through the router(s) in question, this can pose
      a significant hurdle to some troubleshooting scenarios.

   o  On some devices, by default the link-layer address of the
      interface is derived from the MAC address assigned to interface.
      When this is done, swapping out the interface hardware (e.g.
      interface card) will cause the link-layer address to change.  In
      some cases (peering config, ACLs, etc) this may require additional
      changes.  However, many devices allow the link-layer address of an
      interface to be explicitly configured, which avoids this issue.

   o  The practice of naming router interfaces using DNS names is
      difficult and not recommended when using link-locals only.  More
      generally, it is not recommended to put link-local addresses into
      DNS; see [RFC4472].

   o  It is often not possible to identify the interface or link (in a
      database, email, etc) by giving just its address without also
      specifying the link in some manner.

   It should be noted that it is quite possible for the same link-local
   address to be assigned to multiple interfaces.  This can happen
   because the MAC address is duplicated (due to manufacturing process
   defaults or the use of virtualization), because a device deliberately
   re-uses automatically-assigned link-local addresses on different
   links, or because an operator manually assigns the same easy-to-type
   link-local address to multiple interfaces.  All these are allowed in
   IPv6 as long as the addresses are used on different links.

   For more discussion on the pros and cons, see
   [I-D.ietf-opsec-lla-only].  See also [RFC5375] for IPv6 unicast
   address assignment considerations.

   Today, most operators use numbered links (option b).

2.2.  Static Routes

2.2.1.  Link-Local Next-Hop in a Static Route?

   What form of next-hop address should one use in a static route?

   a.  Use the far-end's link-local address as the next-hop address, OR

   b.  Use the far-end's GUA/ULA address as the next-hop address?

   Recall that the IPv6 specs for OSPF [RFC5340] and ISIS [RFC5308]
   dictate that they always use link-locals for next-hop addresses.  For
   static routes, [RFC4861] section 8 says:

      A router MUST be able to determine the link-local address for each
      of its neighboring routers in order to ensure that the target
      address in a Redirect message identifies the neighbor router by
      its link-local address.  For static routing, this requirement
      implies that the next-hop router's address should be specified
      using the link-local address of the router.

   This implies that using a GUA or ULA as the next hop will prevent a
   router from sending Redirect messages for packets that "hit" this
   static route.  All this argues for using a link-local as the next-hop
   address in a static route.

   However, there are two cases where using a link-local address as the
   next-hop clearly does not work.  One is when the static route is an
   indirect (or multi-hop) static route.  The second is when the static
   route is redistributed into another routing protocol.  In these
   cases, the above text from RFC 4861 notwithstanding, either a GUA or
   ULA must be used.

   Furthermore, many network operators are concerned about the
   dependency of the default link-local address on an underlying MAC
   address, as described in the previous section.

   Today most operators use GUAs as next-hop addresses.

2.3.  IGPs

2.3.1.  IGP Choice

   One of the main decisions for an IPv6 implementer is the choice of
   IGP (Interior Gateway Protocol) within the network.  The primary
   choices are the IETF protocols of RIP [RFC2080], OSPF [RFC2328]
   [RFC5340] and IS-IS [RFC5120] [RFC5308], though some operators may

   consider non-IETF protocols.  Here we limit our discussion to the
   pros and cons of OSPF vs. IS-IS.

   Considering just OSPF vs. IS-IS, the discussion in this section
   revolves around the options in the table below:

   +--------+--------+---------+---------+------------+----------------+
   | Option |  IGP   | IGP for |  Known  |    Hard    |    Similar     |
   |        |  for   |   IPv6  | to work | separation | configuration  |
   |        |  IPv4  |         |   well  |            |    possible    |
   +--------+--------+---------+---------+------------+----------------+
   |        |        |         |         |            |                |
   +--------+--------+---------+---------+------------+----------------+
   |   a    | IS-IS  |  IS-IS  |   YES   |     -      |      YES       |
   +--------+--------+---------+---------+------------+----------------+
   |   b    | IS-IS  |  OSPFv3 |    -    |    YES     |       -        |
   +--------+--------+---------+---------+------------+----------------+
   |        |        |         |         |            |                |
   +--------+--------+---------+---------+------------+----------------+
   |   c    | OSPFv2 |  IS-IS  |   YES   |    YES     |       -        |
   +--------+--------+---------+---------+------------+----------------+
   |   d    | OSPFv2 |  OSPFv3 |   YES   |    YES     |      YES       |
   +--------+--------+---------+---------+------------+----------------+
   |        |        |         |         |            |                |
   +--------+--------+---------+---------+------------+----------------+
   |   e    | OSPFv3 |  IS-IS  |    -    |    YES     |       -        |
   +--------+--------+---------+---------+------------+----------------+
   |   f    | OSPFv3 |  OSPFv3 |    -    |     -      |      YES       |
   +--------+--------+---------+---------+------------+----------------+

   Three of the options above are marked as "Known to work well".  These
   options have seen significant deployments and are generally
   considered to be good choices.  The other options represent valid
   choices, but have not seen widespread use, so it is hard to offer
   comments on how well they work.  In particular, options (e) and (f)
   use OSPFv3 to route IPv4 [RFC5838], which is still rather new and
   untested.

   A number of options are marked "Gives hard separation".  These
   options use a different IGP for IPv4 vs IPv6.  With these options, a
   problem with routing IPv6 is unlikely to affect IPv4 or visa-versa.

   Three options are marked "Similar configuration possible".  This
   means it is possible (but not required) to use very similar IGP
   configuration for IPv4 and IPv6: for example, the same area
   boundaries, area numbering, link costing, etc.  If you are happy with
   your IPv4 IGP design, then this will likely be a consideration.  By
   contrast, the options that uses IS-IS for one IP version and OSPF for

Internet-Draft             IPv6 Design Choices            September 2014


   the other version will require quite different configuration, and
   will also require the operations staff to become familiar with the
   difference between the two protocols.

   With option (a), there is an additional choice of whether to run IS-
   IS in single-topology mode (where IPv4 and IPv6 share a single
   topology and a single set of link costs[RFC5308]) or multi-topology
   mode (where IPv4 and IPv6 have separate topologies and potentially
   different link costs[RFC5120]).  A big problem with single-topology
   mode is that it cannot easily accommodate devices that support
   IPv4-only or IPv6-only.  Thus, today there is general agreement that
   multi-topology is the right choice as this gives the greatest
   flexibility in network design.

   It should be noted that a number of ISPs have run OSPF as their IPv4
   IGP for quite a few years, but have selected IS-IS as their IPv6 IGP.
   However, there are very few (none?) that have made the reverse
   choice.  This is, in part, because routers generally support more
   nodes in an IS-IS area than in the corresponding OSPF area, and
   because IS-IS is seen as more secure because it runs at layer 2.

2.4.  BGP

   The discussion in this section revolves around the following table.

   The first column lists various route families, where "unlabeled"
   means SAFI 1, "labeled" means SAFI 4, and "VPN" means SAFI 128.  The
   second column lists the protocol used to transport the BGP session,
   frequently specified by giving either an IPv4 or IPv6 address in the
   "neighbor" statement.

   The third column comments on the combination in the first two
   columns:

   o  For combinations marked "Works well", these combinations are
      widely supported and are generally recommended.

   o  For combinations marked "Next-hop issues", these combinations are
      less-widely supported and when supported, often have next-hop

      issues.  That is, the next-hop address is typically a v4-mapped
      IPv6 address, which is based on some IPv4 address on the sending
      router.  This v4-mapped IPv6 address is often not reachable by
      default using IPv6 routing.  One common solution to this problem
      is to use routing policy to change the next-hop to a different
      IPv6 address.

   o  For combinations marked as "???", it is believed that these
      combinations will not be supported until MPLS over IPv6 becomes
      available.  [Need to Confirm].

   Also, it is important to note that changing the set of address
   families being carried over a BGP session requires the BGP session to
   be reset (unless something like [I-D.ietf-idr-dynamic-cap] or
   [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-multisession] is in use).  This is generally more
   of an issue with eBGP sessions than iBGP sessions: for iBGP sessions
   it is common practice for a router to have to two iBGP sessions, one
   to each member of a route reflector pair, and so one can change the
   set of address families on first one session and then the other.

   The following subsections discuss specific scenarios in more detail.

2.4.1.  BGP Sessions for Unlabeled Routes

   Unlabeled routes are commonly carried on eBGP sessions, as well as on
   iBGP sessions in networks where Internet traffic is carried unlabeled
   across the network.  In these scenarios, operators today most
   commonly use two BGP sessions: one session is transported over IPv4
   and carries the unlabeled IPv4 routes, while the second session is
   transported over IPv6 and carries the unlabeled IPv6 routes.

   There are several reasons for this choice:

   o  It gives a clean separation between IPv4 and IPv6.

   o  This avoids the next-hop problem described in note 1 above.

   o  The status of the routes follows the status of the underlying
      transport.  If, for example, the IPv6 data path between the two
      BGP speakers fails, then the IPv6 session between the two speakers
      will fail and the IPv6 routes will be withdrawn, which will allow
      the traffic to be re-routed elsewhere.  By contrast, if the IPv6
      routes were transported over IPv4, then the failure of the IPv6
      data path might leave a working IPv4 data path, so the BGP session
      would remain up and the IPv6 routes would not be withdrawn, and
      thus the IPv6 traffic would be sent into a black hole.

   o  It avoids resetting the BGP session when adding IPv6 to an
      existing session, or when removing IPv4 from an existing session.

2.4.2.  BGP sessions for Labeled or VPN Routes

   In these scenarios, it is most common today to carry both the IPv4
   and IPv6 routes over sessions transported over IPv4.  This can be
   done with either: (a) one session carrying both route families, or
   (b) two sessions, one for each family.

   Using a single session is usually appropriate for an iBGP session
   going to a route reflector handling both route families.  Using a
   single session here usually means that the BGP session will reset
   when changing the set of address families, but as noted above, this
   is usually not a problem when redundant route reflectors are
   involved.

   In eBGP situations, two sessions are usually more appropriate.

2.4.3.  eBGP Endpoints: Global or Link-Local Addresses?

   When running eBGP over IPv6, there are two options for the addresses
   to use at each end of the eBGP session (or more properly, the
   underlying TCP session):

   a.  Use link-local addresses for the eBGP session, OR

   b.  Use global addresses for the eBGP session.

   Note that the choice here is the addresses to use for the eBGP
   sessions, and not whether the link itself has global (or unique-
   local) addresses.  In particular, it is quite possible for the eBGP
   session to use link-local addresses even when the link has global
   addresses.

   The big attraction for option (a) is security: an eBGP session using
   link-local addresses is impossible to attack from a device that is
   off-link.  This provides very strong protection against TCP RST and
   similar attacks.  Though there are other ways to get an equivalent
   level of security (e.g.  GTSM [RFC5082], MD5 [RFC5925], or ACLs),
   these other ways require additional configuration which can be
   forgotten or potentially mis-configured.

   However, there are a number of small disadvantages to using link-
   local addresses:

   o  Using link-local addresses only works for single-hop eBGP
      sessions; it does not work for multi-hop sessions.

   o  One must use "next-hop self" at both endpoints, otherwise re-
      advertising routes learned via eBGP into iBGP will not work.
      (Some products enable "next-hop self" in this situation
      automatically).

   o  Operators and their tools are used to referring to eBGP sessions
      by address only, something that is not possible with link-local
      addresses.

   o  If one is configuring parallel eBGP sessions for IPv4 and IPv6
      routes, then using link-local addresses for the IPv6 session
      introduces extra operational differences between the two sessions
      which could otherwise be avoided.

   o  On some products, an eBGP session using a link-local address is
      more complex to configure than a session that use a global
      address.

   o  If hardware or other issues cause one to move the cable to a
      different local interface, then reconfiguration is required at
      both ends: at the local end because the interface has changed (and
      with link-local addresses, the interface must always be specified
      along with the address), and at the remote end because the link-
      local address has likely changed.  (Contrast this with using
      global addresses, where less re-configuration is required at the
      local end, and no reconfiguration is required at the remote end).

   o  Finally, a strict interpretation of RFC 2545 can be seen as
      forbidding running eBGP between link-local addresses, as RFC 2545
      requires the BGP next-hop field to contain at least a global
      address.

   For these reasons, most operators today choose to have their eBGP
   sessions use global addresses.

3.  General Observations

   There are two themes that run though many of the design choices in
   this document.  This section presents some general discussion on
   these two themes.

3.1.  Use of Link-Local Addresses

   The proper use of link-local addresses is a common theme in the IPv6
   network design choices.  Link-layer addresses are, of course, always
   present in an IPv6 network, but current network design practice
   mostly ignores them, despite efforts such as
   [I-D.ietf-opsec-lla-only].

   There are three main reasons for this current practice:

   o  Network operators are concerned about the volatility of link-local
      addresses based on MAC addresses, despite the fact that this
      concern can be overcome by manually-configuring link-local
      addresses;

   o  It is impossible to ping a link-local address from a device that
      is not on the same subnet.  This is a troubleshooting
      disadvantage, though it can also be viewed as a security
      advantage.

   o  Most operators are currently running networks that carry both IPv4
      and IPv6 traffic, and wish to harmonize their IPv4 and IPv6 design
      and operational practices where possible.

3.2.  Separation of IPv4 and IPv6

   Currently, most operators are running or planning to run networks
   that carry both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.  Hence the question: To what
   degree should IPv4 and IPv6 be kept separate?  As can be seen above,
   this breaks into two sub-questions: To what degree should IPv4 and
   IPv6 traffic be kept separate, and to what degree should IPv4 and
   IPv6 routing information be kept separate?

   The general consensus around the first question is that IPv4 and IPv6
   traffic should generally be mixed together.  This recommendation is
   driven by the operational simplicity of mixing the traffic, plus the
   general observation that the service being offered to the end user is
   Internet connectivity and most users do not know or care about the
   differences between IPv4 and IPv6.  Thus it is very desirable to mix
   IPv4 and IPv6 on the same link to the end user.  On other links,
   separation is possible but more operationally complex, though it does
   occasionally allow the operator to work around limitations on network
   devices.  The situation here is roughly comparable to IP and MPLS
   traffic: many networks mix the two traffic types on the same links
   without issues.

   By contrast, there is more of an argument for carrying IPv6 routing
   information over IPv6 transport, while leaving IPv4 routing
   information on IPv4 transport.  By doing this, one gets fate-sharing
   between the control and data plane for each IP protocol version: if
   the data plane fails for some reason, then often the control plane
   will too.
