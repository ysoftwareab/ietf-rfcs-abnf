1.  Introduction

   Internet of Things (IoT) involves the interconnection of a variety of
   heterogeneous devices.  Managing these diverse sets of devices is
   however extremely challenging.  In certain usage scenarios, it is
   essential to identify the IoT devices that have semantically similar
   properties as a group and control them with a single management
   command, so that they can substitute for each other in case any of
   them fails.  IoT devices may be employed by the device owner in
   operational contexts or usage scenarios that were not originally
   envisioned at production time by the device vendor.

   This document defines firstly functionality levels for IoT devices
   that describe the device capabilities at the granularity of devices,
   objects and resources.  It additionally presents a metric to measure
   the functional similarity between the manageable properties of any
   two IoT devices, called Functionality Distance (FD).  FD calculates a
   specific distance between the two devices, with the said distance
   being an indication of the extent to which one device can be
   substituted for the other.  In experimental evaluations [LwRSD], the
   results show that this mechanism successfully uncovers similarities
   between resources that are not that straightforward at first glance.
   For example, network connected TVs, smart speakers and light-bulbs
   can be used as emergency warning systems in a building.

2.  Functionality Levels

   An IoT device can be considered to be semantically composed as a set
   of objects, with each object being a set of resources.  The resource
   is an atomic piece of device information that can be managed.  This
   document presents three level of functionalities as shown in
   Figure 1: Device Functionality, Object Functionality, Resource
   Functionality, that together delineate the complete functionality of
   the device.  (TODO provides specific definition for each one)

                      Figure 1: Functionality Levels.

   The Devices could present different functionalities, for example, the
   one that is given by the Manufacturer and then, the user can define
   different functionalities for the devices.  For example, Figure 2
   depicts a device composed of 2 objects.  The manufacturer provides
   Functionality 1 (composed of both objects, and their resources), as
   well as Functionality 2 (composed only of object 2 and resource 3).
   Upon obtaining ownership of the device, the user defines two
   additional functionalities: Functionality 3 (composed only of object
   1 and resource 2) and Functionality 4 (composed of object 1, resource
   1 and object 2, resource 3).

3.  Use cases

   Some use cases where defining Functionalities and FDs for grouping
   and managing IoT devices are presented here:

   o  Alert in case of fire: The goal in this use case is to group the
      devices that present some type of features that can be used to
      alert a user in case of fire.

   o  Reduction of the sound in a room: The goal in this use case is to
      identify (group) devices that produce some type of sound like
      audio, buzzer and turn them off.

   o  Event Notification to a disabled person: The goal in this use case
      is to find the devices that present features that can be used for
      disabled people to get information about the environment.  For
      example for a deaf person, we are interested in grouping devices
      that can notify to that person about events, such as the
      dishwasher stop, through a sighted-sensor like light-bulb change
      color.

   o  TODO add more use cases.

4.  Functionality Distance

   In certain usage scenarios, it is required to identify the IoT
   devices that have similar properties as a group and control them with
   a single management command.  This can not only lead to efficiency
   gains at the protocol level, but also improve the overall user
   experience.  As an example, consider the case of a fire emergency in
   a smart building.  In such a scenario, it would be useful to group
   all Internet-connected IoT devices that have any output capability,
   to warn the users in their vicinity about the danger of a fire, so
   that they can substitute for each other if any of them fails.

   One way to address the above requirement is to calculate the
   relatedness between devices through what we call functionality
   distance.  The functionality distance in this document is defined as
   the capability between two devices to perform the same function.  We
   define a set of contextual requirements, e.g., the device should be
   able to alert in case of fire, and based on that we define weights to
   each resource.  Then, we calculate the distance between the resources
   as per the contextual requirements.

   The method that calculates the semantic distance between two objects
   should have these properties:

   o  The objects that are equal semantically should have distance of 0.

   o  The objects that are quite close semantically should have distance
      close to 0

   o  The objects that are far semantically should have distance close
      to 1.

   o  The objects that are not related semantically should have distance
      of 1.

   o  The distance between object A and B should be the same that
      between the object B and A.

   o  The method should be able to be adapted to any type of environment
      and objects.

   The Functionality Distance metric considers the following components:

   1.  A Set of Contextual Requirements (SCoRq): These requirements have
       the function to fulfill one or more goals, e.g., I have a goal to
       group devices that are able to alert about a fire.  Namely, these
       requirements help to identify the relevance of a property to
       fulfill the goal, e.g. a device with a dimmable feature allows
       alerts in case of fire by changing the color of the device.  In
       this scenario, a property that indicates if the device has a
       dimmable feature has more relevance than the property that define
       the name of the device.  SCoRq is defined as a set of properties.
       The amount of properties of a SCoRq is indicated with tr.  SCoRq
       = {pr_1, pr_2, ..., pr_{tr}},

   2.  The weight assigned to the resource property (p): Indicates the
       relevance of the property to fulfill a goal, namely the
       contextual requirement (SCoRq).  The values close to 1 for p
       indicate that the property is relevant to fulfill the contextual
       requirement and values close to 0 indicate that the relevance is
       minimal, e.g., a dimmable property is going to have p = 0.95,
       since it is relevant to alert in case of fire.  On the other
       hand, the name of the device does not provide useful information
       since it can be an arbitrary name, then the weight should not be
       high, we could assign a value of p = 0.10.

   3.  Direct Links (DL) between resources: If two resources have the
       same property, it implies that there exists a link (Direct Link)
       between them, e.g., if a Smart Tv object and a light bulb both
       have a dimmable property, it means that there exists a link
       between the Smart Tv and the light bulb.  The value of the DL is
       the weight assigned to a property.

   The relatedness between properties of two devices is defined as
   FD(a,b)= (n-dl)/(1+SDL(a,b)), where "n" is the total number of
   properties, "dl" is the total number of direct links between
   properties and "SDL" indicates the Sum of all Direct Links between
   properties of two devices.

   The mechanisms described in this document have been applied to two
   research papers described in the following subsections to two
   specific architectures.
