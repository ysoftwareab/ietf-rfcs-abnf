Abstract

   SIP is being used more an more today for everyday communication
   purposes.  With this widespread adoption comes the inevitability of
   abuse.  This document describes the problems that fit into the
   category of "unwanted Communication".

Terminology

Internet-Draft           RUCUS Problem statement           February 2008


1.  Introduction

   As worldwide communication infrastructure is shifting to IP the
   potential for disruption or abuse is increasing as well (see cost
   analysis brought down in [RFC5039]).  As such it is important to be
   able to assess the potential threat so that possible remedies can be
   sought.  It is important to stress, however, that this document and
   by extension this WG is not focusing ONLY on fraud or
   misrepresentation attacks such as those mentioned in [RFC5039]) but
   on all types of "unwanted" communications.

   Fortunately (or unfortunately) we have a large body of work already
   completed in other similar areas such as email and as such the
   guiding principles of this WG MUST be:

   What has been done right

   What has been done wrong

   What should have been done earlier


2.  Unwanted Communication

   So what constitutes Unwanted Communication?  Until now, most of the
   work that has been done in this area in the various IETF WGs has
   focused on the "misrepresentation" issue ([RFC5039]) suggesting
   strong Identity (e.g.  [RFC4474]) as the cornerstone of any solution.
   Lately, there has been a lot of discussion on the various lists
   trying to extend the identity protection (or better yet - give it
   some meaning) to e.164 numbers as well as sip URIs.

   Still, this is only one aspect of "Unwanted Communications" and
   focusing or solving only this issue (if at all possible) will clearly
   not eliminate SPAM.  As an example, one attack that is cropping up of
   late is a hybrid email VoIP attack which upgrades the age old
   phishing attack by replacing a compromised web server with a
   compromised PBX (or one set up just for this purpose) and includes an
   e.164 number in the email message that supposedly is sent by your
   bank instead of the traditional fake URL.  Since there is no "whois"
   equivalent for e.164 numbers there is no way today to combat this
   attack.  While not much can be done if the unsuspecting caller
   initiates the call from the PSTN, if the call is initiated using SIP,
   there may be some help we can provide.  But this help is contingent
   on us realizing that the problem scope is wider than we previously
   imagined.

   Following is an initial list of possible unwanted communication

   categories:

    Data Mining -       This category includes messaging whose sole
                        purpose is to mine for information.
                        Included in this category are things like Number
                        Harvesting via SIP or ENUM

    B-side attacks -    This category is rooted in the lack of a
                        "whois" equivalent for e.164 numbers and
                        includs attacks where the originating
                        party has no information attesting to the
                        credibility or authenticity of the signaled
                        party

    Lack of policy -    This category deals with the non-malicious
                        middle-of-the-night or foreign-language
                        communication.  Strong identity will not
                        prevent this sort of communication.

    Misrepresentation - The one we all like to hate. In this
                        category are included:

                        * Telemarketing
                        * Fraudulent access (e.g. voice mail)

                        Any application where access is based
                        on the signaling party's phone number
                        falls into this category

    "underprivileged" - Malicious applications just trying to
                        gain a foothold on a remote computer fall
                        into this category. This class addresses
                        attacks that use IP communications as
                        a means rather than an end.

               Figure 1: Unwanted Communications Categories

   You will note in the list above I have included things like number
   mining even though the is not part of a "communication" process.  I
   did this since this is a prepatory attack for unwanted communcations
   I felt it should be dealt with in this context as well.


3.  Data Mining

   As opposed to the URI namespace which is infinite, the e.164
   namespace which is in use for the majority of SIP voice calls today
   is not large in computing terms.  As a result, it is quite trivial to



Schwartz                 Expires August 21, 2008                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft           RUCUS Problem statement           February 2008


   gather or mine this information for use (individually or for resale)
   in misrepresentation attacks.  Low volume SIP INVITE messages
   recording failures (e.g. 404 Not found) and successes (e.g. 183
   Session Progress) are highly effective and relatively hard to defend
   against.  These kind of attacks have been seen in the field using
   both SIP [RFC3261] and ENUM [RFC3761]


4.  B-Side Attacks

   It is important to understand that SPAM is not static but rather is
   all about economics and adapts accoridignly.  While the return on
   investment for the misrepresentation attacks does not yet justify
   widespread use, the ROI for B-side attacks is clearer and is being
   seen in the field today.  Basically, the spammers go with what works
   - and phishing works better than telemarketing.  When you do the math
   you see that a very small hit percentage is needed for a highly
   successful phishing campaign to materialize.  Continual improvement
   in protection against this sort of attack is forcing the phishers to
   adapt as well (e.g. inline GIFs instead of embedded URLs that can be
   verified).

   Against this backdrop it is to be expected that the next step in the
   evolution of phishing is to include an instruction to dial a DID or
   virtual phone number that the caller has no way to verify - where
   this will lead to nefarius activities.  In a sense it is the "B-side"
   that is threatening the "A-side" and hence the name of this category.
   It is important to realize that this attack is not unique to IP
   communications.  The compromised "B-side" could belong a PSTN
   compromised switch.  The thing is that (a) its harder to comparmise a
   PSTN switch (b) who ever said that we have to limit ourselves to the
   protection available on the PSTN?


5.  Lack Of Policy

   Unwanted communication is subjective - not objective.  As such it is
   entirely possible for a legitimate call to be unwanted (even at the
   level of not having the phone ring and force me to answer) at its
   intended destination and it is completely reasonable to arm the
   receiving party with the ability to prevent this sort of occurance
   a-priori.  In order to combat this form of unwanted communication
   there is a need for policy exchange mechanisms as discussed in
   [I-D.tschofenig-sipping-framework-spit-reduction]

6.  Misrepresentation

   This category deals with propagation of trusted identity across trust
   boundaries and is covered in [RFC5039].


7.  Regulatory

   It wouldn't be right to finish a document describing the RUCUS
   problem statement without raising the specter of regulatory
   involvement.  An incident which occurred in 1997 in which House
   Speaker Newt Gingrich's cellular telephone conversation was illegally
   intercepted, taped and published by the media prompted calls in
   Congress for stronger anti-eavesdropping legislation.  One can only
   imagine what unwanted communications to one of these legislatures
   will cause to IP communications.


8.  Security Considerations

   document.]]

   phishing.
