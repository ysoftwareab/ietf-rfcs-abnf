Abstract

   This document defines the MIME sub-type audio/t38.  The packetization
   and usage of this MIME type, which is intended for use within SDP [2]
   and H.248 [3] systems, is specified within ITU-T Recommendation T.38
   [1].

1. Introduction

   ITU-T Recommendation T.38 defines the Internet Facsimile Protocol
   (IFP) and packetization of that protocol for carriage over IP
   networks.  As one option, IFP packets may be carried within an RTP
   stream, either as the only content within the media stream or
   switched along with other audio payload types.

   Utilizing RTP for the carriage of facsimile signals over IP networks
   allows devices to take advantage of the forward error correction,
   redundancy, and security mechanisms designed for RTP.  In addition,
   RTCP provides valuable statistics including packet loss and jitter,
   which may be utilized to improve service quality.

   Switching between payload types, such as audio and IFP, allows
   devices such as media gateways to transition between audio and fax
   relay very gracefully.  It should be noted that in the context of a
   media gateway, the IFP encoding is merely an alternative encoding of
   the audio channel and the main driver for introducing the carriage of
   facsimile via RTP.

2. audio/t38 Usage

   The usage of audio/t38 for SDP and H.248-based systems is defined in
   Annexes D and E of Recommendation T.38, respectively.

   This media sub-type registration is not intended for use with e-mail.

3. IANA Registration

   To: ietf-types@iana.org
   Subject: Registration of Standard MIME media type audio/t38

   MIME media type name: audio

   MIME subtype name: t38

   Require parameters: none

   Optional parameters: none

   Encoding considerations: binary

   Security considerations:

      The IFP packets carried via RTP do not carry any particular
      security risks in and of themselves.  However, as with other
      audio packets, there is the potential for unauthorized
      eavesdropping on facsimile transmissions if the media stream is
      not properly secured.

   Interoperability considerations:

      ITU-T Recommendation T.38 defines the procedures, syntax, and
      parameters for the carriage of T.38 over RTP within the context
      of H.323 [4], SIP [5], and H.248 [3] systems.

      facsimile communication over IP networks", with Amendment TBD,

   Applications which use this media type:

      Real-time facsimile (fax)

4. Security Considerations

   The IFP packets carried via RTP do not carry any particular security
   risks in and of themselves.  However, as with other audio packets,
   there is the potential for unauthorized eavesdropping or manipulation
   of facsimile transmissions if the media stream is not properly
   secured.
