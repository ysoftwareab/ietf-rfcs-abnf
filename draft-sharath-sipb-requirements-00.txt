Abstract 
    
   This informational internet draft describes the requirements for a 
   standard business telephone based on the Session Initiation Protocol 
   (SIP). The objective of this document is to provide a minimum set of 
   requirements for implementing business features on SIP endpoints.  
    
   This draft is intended to serve as a requirements document for 
   vendors    implementing    business    features    on    SIP    based 
   devices/entities. Details of how each capability or feature is best 
   implemented in SIP, is beyond the scope of this document and may be 
   tracked through the working group draft submissions.

1. Introduction 
   The next generation voice market has seen the introduction of User 
   Agents  that  are  equipped  with  powerful  processors,  rich  user 
   interfaces, and the ability to provide end user features well beyond 
   that of their predecessors.  
    


     
   Venkatesh                                                         3 
Internet-Draft                  SIP-B                       June 2003 
                                    
    
   This draft is intended to serve as a requirements document for 
   vendors    implementing    business    features    on    SIP    based 
   devices/entities. Details of how each feature is best implemented in 
   SIP, is beyond the scope of this document and may be tracked through 
   the working group draft submissions. 
    
   In order to illustrate certain features, this draft makes use of the 
   terms ÊÊtelephone∆∆, ÊÊphone∆∆ or ÊÊbusiness phone∆∆. It is not a literal 
   interpretation of a device or its capabilities but rather a term 
   used to describe the functional attributes of a business endpoint. 
   This in no way limits the scope and applicability of this document 
   to physical devices available in the marketplace. The requirements 
   specified in this document may be applied to any SIP user agent, SIP 
   enabled device or soft phone in a business context. 
    
   This document first describes the various capabilities that are 
   required on a SIP business phone and then lists the required 
   services that need to be supported on the phone. 
 
    
2. SIP Business Phone Capabilities 
   In order to function in a business context, a SIP business phone 
   needs to have a base set of capabilities. This section defines the 
   requirements  for  supporting  these  capabilities  in  four  general 
   categories: 
    
     . Device Capabilities. 
      
     . Line Capabilities. 
 
     . Display and Alerting Capabilities. 
      
     . Business Application Capabilities. 
 
2.1 Device Capabilities 
   Device  capabilities  are  a  set  of  capabilities  needed  for  the 
   business phone to send and receive SIP signaling and media. In order 
   to configure a SIP business phone and authenticate it within a 
   domain,  a  set  of  configuration  capabilities  is  needed.  These 
   configuration options are part of the device capabilities, which 
   determine how the phone is configured and integrated into the 
   network. 
    
 2.1.1 Requirements for supporting Device Capabilities: 
    
   DC-1: A SIP business phone MUST have a network connection on which 
   SIP signaling messages may be received and sent. 
    
   DC-2: The SIP business phone MUST be addressable by an IP Address 
   either through automatic configuration (DHCP) or through manual 
   configuration. 
    

     
   Venkatesh                                                         4 
Internet-Draft                  SIP-B                       June 2003 
                                    
    
   DC-3: A SIP business phone MUST support handset and hands-free mode. 
   It MUST have an option to toggle between handset mode and hands-free 
   mode. 
    
   DC-3: A SIP business phone MUST receive and send media (RTP). 
    
   DC-4: A SIP business phone MUST support the G.711 Codec for media. 
   Additionally, the phones MAY support additional codecs like G.729. 
    
   DC-5: A SIP business phone MUST support RFC 2833 [20] for the 
   transport of DTMF digits in RTP. 
    
   DC-6: The phone MUST support SIP REGISTER semantics per RFC 3261 [2] 
   for registering with a registrar.  
    
   DC-7: SIP business phones MUST allow for direct registrations where, 
   the phone sends a REGISTER to the registrar and gets authenticated 
   [2]. 
    
   DC-8: SIP business phones SHOULD allow for third party registrations 
   where the phone may be registered by the operator/user through some 
   external interface (without an explicit REGISTER message). 
    
   DC-9: SIP business phones MUST have a configuration option for its 
   outbound proxy or feature server. This is the address where it will 
   register. 
    
   DC-10: SIP business phones SHOULD support HTTP. 
    
    
2.2 Line Capabilities 
   Line capabilities are a set of capabilities needed for basic call 
   processing,  and  enable  basic  telephony  services.  This  set  of 
   capabilities enable users to place calls, receive calls and perform 
   basic call control operations. Line capabilities provide the ability 
   to select between multiple lines or choose to monitor the state of 
   another phone line. 
    
 2.2.1 Requirements for supporting Line Capabilities 
    
   LC-1: A SIP business phone MUST support RFC 3261 [2] 
    
   LC-2: A SIP business phone MUST support RFC 2782 [22] and query DNS 
   SRV for resolving hostnames. 
    
   LC-3: SIP business phones MUST support SDP media negotiation RFC 
   2327 [23] and RFC 3264[7]. 
    
   LC-4: SIP business phones MUST support RFC 3262 [20] for ensuring 
   that  provisional  responses  to  all  SIP  requests  are  delivered 


     
   Venkatesh                                                         5 
Internet-Draft                  SIP-B                       June 2003 
                                    
    
   reliably  end-to-end  independent  of  the  underlying  transport 
   mechanism.  
    
   LC-5: SIP business phones MUST support RFC 3515 [19] for support of 
   the SIP REFER method. 
    
   LC-6: SIP business phones MUST support RFC 3326 [24] so that parties 
   in a SIP session can send out detailed information about the actual 
   reason for a call disconnect. 
    
   LC-7: SIP business phones MUST support RFC 3325 [25] to enable a 
   network of trusted servers to assert the identity of authenticated 
   users. 
    
   LC-8: SIP business phones MUST support RFC 3265 [26] so that 
   notifications may be received from remote endpoints indicating that 
   certain events have occurred. 
    
   LC-9: SIP business phones MUST support RFC 3265 [26] for sending 
   SUBSCRIBE   messages   to   subscribe   to   the   state   of   other 
   lines/endpoints and accept NOTIFY messages that indicate any change 
   in state of the remote device/line. 
    
   LC-10: SIP business phones SHOULD SUBSCRIBE to the dialog state 
   event [10] and Message Waiting Indication (MWI) event [27]. These 
   subscriptions must be available on a per line basis. Phones MAY 
   additionally SUBSCRIBE to other event packages based on the features 
   served. 
    
   LC-11: SIP business phones MUST be able to decode and interpret the 
   text/xml MIME type. 
    
   LC-11: A SIP business phone MUST support at least two or more calls. 
   The phone must be able to initiate another call by placing the 
   current call on hold.  
      
   LC-12: A business phone SHOULD support two or more lines each 
   identified by a separate address or single address. 
    
    
2.3 Audio / Visual Capabilities 
   These capabilities define the audio/visual, display and alerting 
   capabilities of a SIP business phone.  
 
 2.3.1 Requirements for supporting Audio and Visual Capabilities 
    
   AVC-1: The business phone SHOULD provide a visual indicator that 
   informs the user whether some invoked phone feature is active or 
   inactive.  
    
   AVC-2: SIP Business phones SHOULD provide a means to visually 
   indicate media state during the invocation of a particular feature. 
     
   Venkatesh                                                         6 
Internet-Draft                  SIP-B                       June 2003 
                                    
    
   For example the visual indication MAY be a flashing icon to indicate 
   media state on HOLD, or MAY be a steady icon to indicate that media 
   state is two way.  
    
   AVC-3: SIP Business phones SHOULD have the capability to provide 
   different alerting capabilities (like playing different wav files or 
   providing a dialog box based on information provided by a network 
   element) to the end user.  
    
   AVC-4: SIP Business phones SHOULD allow a network element OR phone 
   based configuration option to specify whether the alert mechanism is 
   visual or audio or both. 
    
   AVC-5: SIP Business phones SHOULD have a display that MAY be used 
   for enabling a variety of features, such as indicating incoming 
   calling name and number.  
    
   AVC-6: The display SHOULD support context sensitive soft keys. Soft 
   Keys are specialized feature keys that are not associated with a 
   particular feature. Rather, the feature may be defined either on the 
   UA or in the network, and assigned to a soft key using a label on 
   the screen.  
    
    
2.4 Business Application Capabilities 
   Application capabilities are those capabilities that enable one or 
   more business features to be loaded, removed or invoked on a 
   business phone. 
    
 2.4.1 Requirements for supporting Application Capabilities: 
    
   BAC-1: SIP Business phones SHOULD support a toolkit approach to 
   implementing features on the phone. Rather than negotiate each 
   feature variant, this document suggests using a ÊÊtool kit∆∆ approach, 
   wherein all SIP UA∆s provide and understand a generic set of 
   services that can be used as building blocks to provide advanced 
   business features. 
    
   BAC-2: SIP Business phones SHOULD provide an end user with the 
   capability to update or add new applications at any time.  
    
   BAC-3: Application capabilities MAY be implemented locally on the 
   user agent, or the user agent MAY have the capability to request 
   services from the network upon invocation of a particular feature. 
   SIP business phones SHOULD have a configuration option to indicate 
   which features are implemented directly on the phone and which 
   features require signaling with a feature server. 
    
   BAC-4: The feature assigned to a particular soft key SHOULD be 
   programmable (along with the label on the screen).

3. SIP Business Phone Services 
   This section lists the services that need to be implemented on a SIP 
   business phone. Business phone services are those features that are 
   required on a business telephone based on the desired functionality 
   of the end user in a business environment. Based on the variety of 
   features that are required for business communications, we have 
   classified the services under one of the following five categories: 
    
     . Dial Services. 
      
     . Audio/Visual Indication Services. 
 
     . Digit collection Services. 
 
     . User Interface Services. 
 
     . Advanced Applications. 
    
    
3.1 Dial Services 
   All business telephony features that require a phone to accept a URL 
   from an external application or use a pre-configured URL, and send 
   out an INVITE towards its configured proxy are classified under this 
   category of features.  
    
   DS-1: This draft requires the origination of calls through the 
   business phone on invocation of a specific feature. Configuration of 
   auto-origination  of  calls  for  dial  services  is  left  to  the 
   implementation of the phone. The user MAY be prompted to go off hook 
   to originate the call. Alternatively, the user MAY request the phone 
   to auto-originate the call through some prompt or configuration 
   option. 
    
 3.1.1 Redial 
   DS-2: A SIP business phone MUST support redial operation. The last 
   dialed URL / address must be cached on the phone and when the redial 
   button is pressed (or activated by some other means) the phone 
   should send the INVITE to the cached address. The cached redial 
   URL/address SHOULD persist across phone reboots. 
    
 3.1.2 Last call return 
   DS-3: A SIP business phone MUST be able to call the last incoming 
   unanswered call. The topmost via address of the last unanswered 
   incoming call must be cached on the phone and when the last call 
   return feature is invoked, the phone should send an INVITE to the 
   cached address. The cached last call return URL/address SHOULD 
   persist across phone reboots. 
    
 3.1.3 Call Hold 
   DS-4: All SIP business phones MUST support Call Hold. The user must 
   be able to place an answered call on hold (by press a hold button or 
   through some other means). Phones MUST support negotiating no-media 

     
   Venkatesh                                                         8 
Internet-Draft                  SIP-B                       June 2003 
                                    
    
   during call hold. Phones MAY stream music to the caller during call 
   hold. 
    
 3.1.4 Call UnHold 
   DS-5: All SIP business phones MUST support taking the call off hold. 
   The caller (listening to silence/music) must be reconnected to the 
   called party. 
    
 3.1.5 Do Not Disturb (DND) 
   DS-6: All SIP business phones MUST support DND. The DND feature, 
   when activated, MUST reject any incoming call meant for the phone 
   with a 486 Busy response code or MAY redirect the call to voice 
   mail. If the user invokes the DND feature on an incoming call, the 
   same behavior should apply for the incoming call. The DND feature 
   may  be  programmed  directly  through  the  phone  or  through  some 
   external interface. 
    
 3.1.6 Call Transfer 
   DS-7:  SIP  business  phones  MUST  support  blind  AND  consultative 
   transfer. A user should be able to invoke a blind transfer and 
   transfer the call to a specified address. The user must also have 
   the flexibility of a consultative transfer where the current call is 
   put on hold while a call is made to an address and some conversation 
   ensues before the transfer is invoked. 
    
 3.1.7 Speed Dial 
   DS-8:  SIP  business  phones  MUST  support  speed  dials.  On  the 
   invocation of the speed-dial feature, the phone MUST send out an 
   INVITE to its configured proxy providing the number stored against 
   this button (or the invoking key) in the Request URI. A detail of 
   how  the  speed  dials  are  configured  is  left  to  the  phone 
   implementation. 
    
 3.1.8 Unconditional Call Forwarding 
   DS-9: The SIP business phone MUST have a provision to specify an 
   unconditional forwarding address. This setting would allow users or 
   administrators  to  forward  all  incoming  calls  to  a  designated 
   address. 
    
   DS-10: The phone SHOULD allow the user or operator to manually 
   configure the ring no answer (RNA) timeout associated with this 
   forwarding. The phone must ring the existing destination for the 
   specified number of seconds (RNA) before forwarding the call.  
    
 3.1.9 Conferencing 
   DS-11: SIP Business phones MAY support multi-way conferencing. The 
   business phone MAY support local conferencing where the media mixing 
   is performed directly on the device itself.  
    
   DS-12: Conferencing through a centralized conference controller MAY 
   be supported. In a centralized conference, the central conference 
   controller handles the audio mixing.

Internet-Draft                  SIP-B                       June 2003 
                                    
    
 3.1.10 Hotline 
   DS-13: The SIP business phone SHOULD support the hotline feature. 
   When this feature is invoked, the phone must automatically make a 
   call to a predesignated number/address.  
    
 3.1.11 Warmline 
   DS-14: The SIP business phone SHOULD support the warmline feature 
   which is similar in operation to the hotline feature, except that on 
   invocation, the phone waits for a predetermined time interval for 
   the user to dial a number or url, after which time it automatically 
   makes a call to a predesignated number/address.  
         
 3.1.12 Auto Off Hook 
   DS-15: SIP business phones MUST support auto offhook. The phone must 
   be able to go offhook through some external instruction to the 
   phone. 
    
 3.1.13 Call Park 
   DS-16: The SIP business phones MUST support call park. The phone 
   should be able to park an incoming call at a specified extension 
   number or address.  
    
 3.1.14 Call Pickup (Picking up a parked call) 
   DS-17: SIP business phones MUST support call pickup. The phone must 
   be able to pick up a parked call from any number. By dialing out a 
   specified address/URL the parked call should be picked up (thereby 
   connected) to the phone. 
    
 3.1.15 Directed Call Pickup 
   DS-18: SIP business phones SHOULD support directed call pickup. This 
   feature is a variant of regular call pickup. A user can pick up a 
   call that is ÊÊringing∆∆ at a SIP URL by dialing the SIP URL of the 
   phone that is ringing. The phone should be able to pickup any 
   incoming call to any business phone by invoking this feature. 
    
 3.1.16 Group Call Pickup 
   DS-19: SIP business phones SHOULD support group call pickup. This 
   feature is a variant of regular call pickup. Any phone within a 
   specified group should be able to pickup any incoming call to a 
   business phone within the group. Methods of assigning phones to 
   groups are outside the scope of this document. 
    
 3.1.17 Camp On 
   DS-20: SIP business phones SHOULD support Camp on. When a user 
   receives a busy condition when making a call, may invoke the Camp on 
   feature. Activation of this feature allows the user to hang up. The 
   phone should continue calling the destination address until the call 
   is answered at which time; it alerts the user that the call was 
   successful.  
    
 3.1.18 Bridged Line Appearances (BLA) 
   DS-21: SIP business phones SHOULD support Bridged Line Appearances. 
   The BLA feature allows a single DN to be monitored by multiple 
     
   Venkatesh                                                        10 
Internet-Draft                  SIP-B                       June 2003 
                                    
    
   phones. When a call is offered to this DN, the call is offered to 
   all phones that have a mapping to this DN.  
    
   When a user answers the incoming call, the other users in the BLA 
   group MUST be able to monitor the status of the call. When a call is 
   in progress, other users in the BLA group MUST NOT be able to pick 
   up that call.  
    
   If a user places the call on hold, another member of the BLA group 
   MAY pickup the call.  
    
   Provisioning bridged line appearances and assignment of groups is 
   left to the implementation of the phone. 
    
    
3.2 Audio/Visual Indication Services 
   All business telephony features that require a phone to provide 
   various types of alert indications, be it visual or audible, require 
   the  phone  to  automatically  accept  an  incoming  request,  are 
   classified under this category of services. 
    
   There are a number of business telephony services that rely upon the 
   ability to generate different ring cadences based on the type of 
   incoming call that is being offered to a telephone. Examples include 
   providing ringing cadences based on incoming caller groups, incoming 
   call types, incoming calling number.  
    
   There  may  be  other  features  where-by  an  incoming  call  simply 
   provides visual notification as against providing an audible ring 
   tone. An example where such a capability is required is in a boss-
   secretary arrangement where by the secretary∆s phone is the one that 
   normally  rings,  where  as  the  bosses  phone  has  simply  visual 
   indication. 
    
   A third set of features requires that a specific tone be played 
   before automatically answering an incoming call. Examples where such 
   capabilities are desired include features like attendant barge-in, 
   intercom, and group paging.  
    
   The base SIP specification [2] enables supporting this feature by 
   means of the Alert-Info header.  
    
 3.2.1 Calling Name/Number Display 
   AV-1: A SIP business phone MUST display the calling name OR calling 
   number OR both for an incoming call. Additionally, phones may 
   translate the incoming number into a name (or Ênickname∆) based on a 
   directory search. In case, the calling number/name is blocked, the 
   phone MUST display ÊÊAnonymous∆∆ OR ÊÊUnknown∆∆ to denote that the 
   incoming call has calling number or name blocked.

Internet-Draft                  SIP-B                       June 2003 
                                    
    
 3.2.2 Message Waiting Indication 
   AV-2: SIP business phones MUST support message-waiting indication 
   (MWI). This is typically a visual indication that alerts the user 
   that there is a voice message that has not been read.  
    
 3.2.3 Call Waiting Indication 
   AV-3: SIP business phones MUST support call-waiting indication. When 
   a call is in progress if another call comes to the user, a visual 
   indication that shows the call waiting ID or audible beep MUST be 
   implemented so that the user may place the existing call on hold and 
   pickup the incoming call. 
    
 3.2.4 Distinctive ringing 
   AV-4: SIP business phones MUST support distinctive ringing. The user 
   or operator should have the ability to apply different ring tones to 
   different call types. Assignment of ring tones may be based on type 
   of call (local, international etc) or based on the caller (friend, 
   family, coworker etc). Assignment of ring tones and basis for 
   choosing ring types are left to the phone implementation. 
    
 3.2.5 Intercom 
   AV-5: All SIP business phones SHOULD support the intercom feature. 
   By invoking this feature, the destination phone should automatically 
   go off hook and accept the incoming call. When an intercom session 
   is in progress, the phone MUST display a visual indication for the 
   length of the session. 
    
 3.2.6 Barge 
   AV-6: SIP phones SHOULD support the barge or executive override 
   feature. When a call is in progress between two phones, another 
   phone must be able to invoke the barge feature and ÊÊbarge-in∆∆ to the 
   existing  conversation  or  silently  monitor  the  conversation. 
   Additionally, the operator SHOULD have the flexibility to ÊÊwhisper∆∆ 
   to one of the call participants. This feature is typically used in 
   emergency management situations.  
    
 3.2.7 Paging 
   AV-7: SIP business phones SHOULD support paging or group paging. A 
   phone within a group must be able to invoke this feature whereby 
   calls are made all the phones (within a group) and the phones 
   automatically understand that this is a paging feature and thereby 
   answer the phone so that the operator invoking the paging feature 
   may relay a message. 
  
    
3.3 Digit Collection Services 
   All business telephony features require that a phone support digit 
   collection at various phases of a call set up. These services 
   constitute the digit collection services. 
    
   3.3.1 Authorization/Billing Codes 
   DIGC-1: SIP business phones MUST support inputting authorization or 
   billing codes. When the user dials a URL where the call is to be 
     
   Venkatesh                                                        12 
Internet-Draft                  SIP-B                       June 2003 
                                    
    
   placed, one of the downstream feature proxies may decide that the 
   user has mandatory billing codes enabled. It thus rejects the 
   request with a 407 response providing the realm and domain where in 
   the user needs to be authorized before letting the call through.  
    
   3.3.2 Overlap Dialing 
   DIGC-2: SIP Business phones MUST support overlap dialing where the 
   user is prompted for more digits before completing the call. 
    
    
3.4 User Interface Services 
   The user interface services per this classification deals with 
   providing a user interface for end users to use a particular 
   feature. It is expected that the phone implement a user-friendly 
   interface that clearly denotes the feature that is being invoked and 
   the action expected from the user. The mechanics provided to allow 
   the end user update phone configuration or settings are left to the 
   individual vendor implementing these features and are outside the 
   scope of this draft. 
    
    
3.5 Advanced Applications 
   Phone vendors may choose to implement advanced applications like 
   stock quotes, calendar, match scores etc, over and above those 
   listed  in  this  document.  These  applications  may  be  specially 
   tailored to meet the business requirements for a specific usage. 
   These applications may also serve to differentiate phones offered by 
   different vendors. The definition of these applications and services 
   is beyond the scope of this document. 
    
    
4. Security Considerations 
   SC-1: The requirements specified in this document mandates that SIP 
   business phones MUST support all the security measures defined in 
   RFC 3261 [2].  
    
   SC-2: Adequate security measures need to be taken while implementing 
   the  auto-offhook  feature,  which  can  be  easily  misused.  It  is 
   recommended that a configuration option SHOULD be specified so that 
   the user or operator may enable or disable this feature by logging 
   into the phone or some external interface. 
    
   SC-3: SIP business phones MUST have a way by which its configuration 
   options on the phone or external interface are accessible only after 
   authentication (through a logging in mechanism).
