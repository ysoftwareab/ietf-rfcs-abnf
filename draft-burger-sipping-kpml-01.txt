Abstract

   Keypad Markup Language (KPML) is a markup language used in
   conjunction with SIP and HTTP to provide instructions to SIP User
   Agents for the reporting of user key presses.

Conventions used in this document

   RFC2119 [1] provides the interpretations for the key words "MUST",
   "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
   "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" found in this document.

   In the narrative discussion, the "user device" is a User Agent that
   will report stimulus.  An "application" is a User Agent requesting
   the user device to report stimulus.  The "user" is an entity that

   the application is an application server or proxy server, and the
   user presses keys to generate stimulus.

1. Introduction

   This document describes the Keypad Markup Language, KPML.  KPML is a
   markup [7] that enables "dumb phones" to report on basic user
   key-press interactions.

   This document refers to a "dumb phone" as a user device that does not
   have a display.  Otherwise, it is actually a rather smart device.
   Most KPML implementations require the user device to be an http [2]
   client and interpret KPML markup.

   We strongly discourage the use of non-validating XML parsers, as one
   can expect problems with future versions of KPML.  That said, one can
   envision user devices that only accept SIP reporting and have a fixed
   parser, rather than a full XML parser.  This means that KPML can fit
   in to an extremely small memory and processing footprint.  Note KPML
   has a corresponding lack of functionality.  For those applications
   that require more functionality, please refer to VoiceXML [11] and
   MSCML [10].

   The name of the markup, KPML, reflects its legacy support role.  The
   public switched telephony network (PSTN) accomplished end-to-end
   signaling by transporting Dual-Tone, Multi-Frequency (DTMF) tones in
   the bearer channel.  This is in-band signaling.

      NOTE: The spelunking community already took the name KML for their
      cave data base interchange format.

   From the point of view of an application being signaled, what is
   important is the fact the stimulus occurred, not the tones used to
   transport the stimulus.  For example, an application may ask the
   caller to press the "1" key.  What the application cares about is the
   key press, not that there were two cosine waves at 697 Hz and 1209 Hz
   transmitted.

   A SIP-signaled [3] network transports end-to-end signaling with
   RFC2833 [9] packets.  In RFC2833, the signaling application inserts
   RFC2833 named signal packets instead of generating tones.  The
   receiving application gets the signal information, which is what it
   wanted in the first place.

   RFC2833 is the only method that can correlate the time the end user
   pressed a digit with the user's media.  However, out-of-band
   signaling methods, as are appropriate for user device to application
   signaling, do not need millisecond accuracy.  On the other hand, they
   do need reliability, which RFC2833 does not provide.

   An interested application could request notifications of every key

   press.  However, many of the use cases for such signaling has the
   application interested in only one or a few keystrokes.  Thus we need
   a mechanism for specifying to the user device what stimulus the
   application would like notification of.

2. Overview

   KPML is a stateless, declarative markup.  A KPML document contains a
   <pattern> tag with a series of <regex> tags.  The <regex> tag has a
   value attribute which is a RFC3015 [4] (H.248) digit map.

      NOTE: We use H.248 digit maps instead of MGCP [13] digit maps
      because the former is an IETF standard and the latter is not.

      NOTE: We do not use SRGS [14] DTMF grammars because it is unlikely
      one would use KPML for independent digit collection in a browser
      context.

   Interface attributes, such as the interdigit timeout and what
   constitutes a long key press, are implementation matters beyond the
   scope of this document.

   For many applications, the user device needs to quarantine (buffer)
   digits.  Some applications use modal interfaces where the first few
   key presses determine what the following digits mean.  For a novice
   user, the application may play a prompt describing what mode the
   application is in.  However, "power users" often barge through the
   prompt.

   KPML provides a barge attribute to the <pattern> tag.  The default is
   "barge=yes".  Enabling barge means that the user device buffers
   digits and applies them immediately when the next KPML document
   arrives.  Disabling barge by specifying "barge=no" means the user
   device flushes any collected digits before collecting more digits and
   comparing them against the <pattern> tags.

      NOTE: Quarantine and barge are separate actions.  However, the
      barge action directly determines the quarantine action.  Thus KPML
      only specifies the barge action request.

   If the user presses a key not matched by the <regex> tags, the user
   device discards the key press from consideration against the current
   or future KPML documents.  However, as described above, once there is
   a match, the user device quarantines any keys the user enters
   subsequent to the match.

   KPML documents are independent.  Thus it is not possible for the
   current document to know if a following document will enable barging
   or want the digits flushed.  Therefore, the user device MUST
   quarantine all digits detected between the time of the report (http
   POST or SIP NOTIFY) and the interpretation of the next script, if
   any.  If the next script has "barge=no", then the interpreter MUST
   flush all collected digits.  If the next script has "barge=yes", then



Burger                 Expires September 1, 2003                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                    KPML                        March 2003


   the interpreter MUST apply the collected digits against the digit
   maps presented by the script's <regex> tags.  If there is a match,
   the interpreter MUST quarantine the remaining digits.  If there is no
   match, the interpreter MUST flush all of the collected digits.

   Because it is not possible to know if the signaled digits are for
   local KPML processing or for other recipients of the media stream,
   the user device transmits the digits to the far end in real time,
   using either RFC2833 or by generating the appropriate tones.

      NOTE: If KPML did not have this behavior, then a user device
      executing KPML could easily break called applications.  For
      example, take a personal assistant that uses "*9" for attention.
      If the user presses the "*" key, KPML will hold the digit, looking
      for the "9".  What if the user just enters a "*" key, possibly
      because they accessed an IVR system that looks for "*"?  In this
      case, the "*" would get held by the user device, because it is
      looking for the "*9" pattern.  The user would probably press the
      "*" key again, hoping that the called IVR system just did not hear
      the key press.  At that point, the user device would send both "*"
      entries, as "**" does not match "*9".  However, that would not
      have the effect the user intended when they pressed "*".

3. HTTP Reporting

   For HTTP reporting, each <regex> tag in the markup has an href
   attribute.  When the user enters keypress(es) that match a <regex>
   tag, the user device issues an http POST to the URI specified by the
   href.  The body of the POST is a report of the actual digits entered.
   This is so the user device can indicate what digit string matched a
   pattern with wildcards.

   If the resulting document returned by the http POST is empty, the
   user device terminates the KPML session.

      NOTE: This is different than the behavior for VoiceXML as
      described in Basic Network Media Services with SIP [12], where an
      empty document results in the termination of the session.

   If the KPML document includes "sip:" href targets, and the KPML
   interpreter does not support SIP Reporting, the KPML interpreter MUST
   reject the document in its entirety at interpretation time with the
   appropriate SIP error as described in ?????.

      NOTE: draft-jennings-sip-app-info-00.txt should cover document
      rejection.  It does not right now.  This draft should not address
      document rejection, other than the criteria for rejection.  This
      draft focuses on KPML, not on the initiation mechanism.

4. SIP Reporting

   For SIP reporting, the href attribute of the <regex> tag MUST be
   "sip:".  When the user enters keypress(es) that match a <regex> tag,
   the user device will issue a SIP NOTIFY to the Contact of the
   original INVITE.  A KPML interpreter MUST NOT direct the NOTIFY to
   other SIP endpoints.  See the Security Considerations (Section 10)
   section for the rationale for this restriction.

      The reason one must specify a sip: scheme, and not simply make
      href optional, is to catch a HTTP-based script error where one
      forgets to specify the href tag.  If href was optional, then this
      error would result in the user device generating a SIP NOTIFY,
      which would not be the desired action.

   The specification of any scheme-specific part, that is, anything
   following the colon in "sip:", is an error.  The interpreter MUST
   reject the request.

      NOTE: This greatly simplifies the security issues about who can
      send a NOTIFY to what dialog.  Here we say simply that if someone
      asks you for service, you can tell them about it.  However, you
      cannot tell someone else about it.

   After reporting a SIP <regex>, the interpreter terminates the KPML
   session.  To collect more digits, the requestor must issue a
   re-INVITE on the dialog.

      NOTE: This highlights the "one shot" nature of KPML, reflecting
      the balance of features and ease of implementing an interpreter.
      If your goal is to build an IVR session, we strongly suggest you
      investigate more appropriate technologies such as VoiceXML [11] or
      MSCML [10].

   If the KPML document includes "http:" href targets, and the KPML
   interpreter does not support HTTP Reporting, the KPML interpreter
   MUST reject the document in its entirety at interpretation time with
   the appropriate SIP error as described in ?????.

      NOTE: draft-jennings-sip-app-info-00.txt should cover document
      rejection.  It does not right now.  This draft should not address
      document rejection, other than the criteria for rejection.  This
      draft focuses on KPML, not on the initiation mechanism.

5. Mixing HTTP and SIP

      NOTE: So, now that Pandora's Box is open...

   There is nothing to prevent mixing SIP and HTTP reporting requests in
   the same KPML document.  While this may be a benefit, it has definite
   drawbacks.

   The major drawback is that one cannot negotiate SIP-ness or
   HTTP-ness.  As far as the endpoints are concerned it is all KPML.
   One could use "application/KPML+SIP+XML" and "application/
   KPML+HTTP+XML", but that is pretty ugly.

6. Examples

6.1 Monitoring for Octorhorpe

   A common need for pre-paid and personal assistant applications is to
   monitor a conversation for a signal indicating a change in user focus
   from the party they called through the application to the application
   itself.  For example, if you call a party using a pre-paid calling
   card and the party you call redirects you to voice mail, digits you
   press are for the voice mail system.  However, many applications have
   a special key sequence, such as the octothorpe (#, or pound sign) or
   *9 that terminate the called party leg and shift the user's focus to
   the application.

   The following figure shows the KPML for long octothorpe.  Note that
   the href is really on one line, but divided for clarity.

     <?xml version="1.0">
       <kpml version="1.0">
         <request>
           <pattern>
             <regex value="ZF"
                     href="http://app.example.net/cgi-bin/prepaid? \
                        session=19fsjcalksd&keypress=long-pound" />
           </pattern>
         </request>
       </kpml>

   Figure 1 - Long Octothorpe Example

   In this example, the parameter "session=19fsjcalksd" associates the
   http POST with the SIP call session.  One can use other methods to
   associate the POST with a SIP call.  The following examples will show
   these various methods.

   The regex value Z indicates the following digit needs to be a
   long-duration key press.  F, from the H.248 DTMF package, is the
   octothorpe key.  In fact, KPML supports all digits, 1-9, *, #, A-D
   from the H.248 DTMF package.

6.2 VoiceXML Digit Collection

   One could imagine a VoiceXML [11] platform that wants to have the
   user device signal the user's key presses, while the VoiceXML
   platform still streams prompts to the user device.  Of course, by
   definition, the VoiceXML platform receives all of the user device's
   media.  This is because the user hears prompts from the VoiceXML
   platform and the platform hears all of the user's utterances (e.g.,

Internet-Draft                    KPML                        March 2003


   for recording a message).

   However, let us say that the VoiceXML platform would like to receive
   the stimulus in http, rather than in RFC2833.  Moreover, the KPML
   mechanism enables the user device to immediately barge the prompt,
   saving at least a round-trip-time of latency.

   In this example, a VoiceXML script builds a menu.  The VoiceXML
   interpreter has pulls out a grammar definition similar to the
   following.

     <menu>
       <property name="inputmodes" value="dtmf"/>
       <prompt>
         For sports press 1, For weather press 2, For Stargazer
         astrophysics press 3.  To speak to a person press 0.
       </prompt>
       <choice dtmf="1"
               next="http://www.sports.example.com/vxml/start.vxml"/>
       <choice dtmf="2"
               next="http://www.weather.example.com/intro.vxml"/>
       <choice dtmf="3"
               next="http://www.stargazer.example.com/astronews.vxml"/>
       <choice dtmf="0"
               next="http://www.stargazer.example.com/transfer.vxml"/>
     </menu>

   Note the targets of the href's are opaque strings that have meaning
   only to the VoiceXML platform.

6.3 Dial String Collection

   In this example, the user device collects a dial string.  The
   application uses KPML to quickly determine when the user enters a
   target number.  In addition, KPML indicates what type of number the
   user entered.

       </kpml>

   As before, the targets of the href's are opaque to KPML.  Here the
   href's indicate the type of dial string, such as direct dial (ddd) or
   international direct dial (iddd).

6.4 Interactive Digit Collection

   This is an example where one would probably be better off using a
   full scripting language such as VoiceXML or a device control language
   such as H.248.

   In this example, an application requests the user device to send the
   user's signaling directly to the platform in HTTP, rather than
   monitoring the entire RTP stream.  Figure 5 shows a voice mail menu,
   where presumably the application played a "Press K to keep the
   message, R to replay the message, and D to delete the message"
   prompt.  In addition, the application does not want the user to be
   able to barge the prompt.

   Figure 5 - IVR KPML Example Code

   The target of the http post, "sess$9aej08asd7", identifies the SIP
   session.

      NOTE: It is unclear if this usage of KPML is better than using a
      device control protocol like H.248.  From the application's point
      of view, it has to do the low-level prompt-collect logic.
      Granted, it is relatively easy to change the key mappings for a
      given menu.  However, often more of the call flow than a given
      menu mapping gets changed.  Thus there would be little value in
      such a mapping to KPML.


6.5 SIP Request

   For example, the following figure is the example from Figure 1, but
   with SIP NOTIFY reporting.

     <?xml version="1.0">
       <kpml version="1.0">
         <request>
           <pattern>
             <regex value="ZF"
                     href="sip:" />
           </pattern>
         </request>
       </kpml>

   Figure 6 - Long Octothorpe Example

   The response body is identical to the response that Figure 1 would
   generate.

7. Report Body

   For HTTP or SIP responses, the body of the response from the user
   device is a KPML response form.

   The <response> tag has an attribute, "digits".  The digits attribute
   is the digit string.  The digit string uses the conventional
   characters '*' and '#' for star and octothorpe respectively.

   Figure 7 shows a sample response body to the example in the Dial
   String Collection (Section 6.3) section.

     <?xml version="1.0">
       <kpml version="1.0">
         <response digits="0113224321234"/>
       </kpml>

   Figure 7 - Response Body

      NOTE: KPML does not include a timestamp.  There are a number of
      reasons for this.  First, what timestamp would in include?  Would
      it be the time of the first detected keypress?  The time the
      interpreter collected the entire string?  A range?  Second, if the
      RTP timestamp is a datum of interest, why not simply get RTP in
      the first place?  That all said, if it is really compelling to
      have the timestamp in the response, it will be an attribute to the
      <response> tag.

8. Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Data Type
   Definition (DTD) as described in XML [7].

   <!ELEMENT kpml (request | response)>
   <!ATTLIST kpml version (1.0) #REQUIRED>

   <!ELEMENT request (pattern)>

   <!ELEMENT pattern (regex)>
   <!ATTLIST pattern barge (yes | no) "yes">

   <!ELEMENT regex (value | href)>
   <!ATTLIST regex
           value CDATA #IMPLIED
           href  CDATA #REQUIRED>

   <!ELEMENT response EMPTY>
   <!ATTLIST response
           digits CDATA #IMPLIED>

   Figure 8 - KPML DTD

   And, if you prefer XML Schema [5], here it is.

9. IANA Considerations

9.1 IANA Registration of MIME media type application/kpml+xml

   MIME media type name: application

   MIME subtype name: kpml+xml

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: charset



      charset This parameter has identical semantics to the charset
         parameter of the "application/xml" media type as specified in
         XML Media Types [6].

   Encoding considerations: See RFC3023 [6].

   Interoperability considerations: See RFC2023 [6] and this document.

   Published specification: This document.

   Applications which use this media type: Session-oriented applications
   that have primitive user interfaces.

   Intended usage: COMMON

9.2 Schema Registration

   We really need a place to register the XML Schema.  Where would that
   be?

10. Security Considerations

   KPML presents no further security issues beyond the startup issues
   addressed in the companion documents to this document.

   As an XML markup, all of the security considerations of RFC3023 [6]
   apply.
