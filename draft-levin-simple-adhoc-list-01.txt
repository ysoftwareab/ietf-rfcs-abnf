Abstract

   This document presents an extension to the Session Initiation
   Protocol (SIP)-Specific Event Notification mechanism for subscribing
   to a homogeneous list of resources.  Instead of the subscriber
   sending a SUBSCRIBE for each resource individually, the subscriber
   can define an ad-hoc resource list, subscribe to it, and maintain it
   – all within a single SUBSCRIBE dialog. Changes in the state of the
   resources are reported using NOTIFY within the same dialog in any
   standard SIMPLE format for conveying notifications for lists of
   resources or for individual resources and specified as "accepted"
   during the SUBSCRIBE dialog establishment.

Internet-Draft    Ad-hoc Resource Lists using SUBSCRIBE         Nov 2003


1. Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [2].

   This document uses the Resource List Server (RLS) definition from
   [8].

2. Introduction

   This document presents an extension to the Session Initiation
   Protocol (SIP)-Specific Event Notification mechanism for subscribing
   to a homogeneous list of resources.  Instead of the subscriber
   sending a SUBSCRIBE for each resource individually, the subscriber
   can define an ad-hoc resource list, subscribe to it, and maintain it
   – all within a single SUBSCRIBE dialog. Changes in the state of the
   resources are reported using the same dialog in any standard SIMPLE
   format for conveying notifications for lists of resources (such as
   [8] and [9]) or individual resources (such as [6]) and agreed during
   the SUBSCRIBE dialog establishment.

   This document defines a new XML schema for creation and maintenance
   of a homogeneous list of resources and a new SIP option tag for
   expressing support for this schema.

3. Overview of Operation

   Before using the ad-hoc list subscription, a subscriber needs to know
   that the RLS supports this mode of operation. In order to do so, the
   subscriber SHOULD issue OPTIONS request and ensure that the SIP
   "adhoclist" option tag is included in the RLS response.

   Once the subscriber knows that the RLS supports ad-hoc list
   operations, a Require header MUST be set to "adhoclist" and an
   initial resources list can be included in the SUBSCRIBE.

   It is the responsibility of the subscriber to create the list name.
   The "adhoclist" attributes "uri" and "name" together MUST uniquely
   identify the list within the SUBSCRIBE dialog. The value in the
   Request URI in SUBSCRIBE MAY match the value of "uri" attribute of
   the "adhoclist". The RLS MUST store and maintain the ad-hoc list for
   the life of the SUBSCRIBE dialog.

   Notification format is negotiated by including appropriate SIP option
   tags in the Accept headers of SUBSCRIBE and corresponding Responses
   and is out of scope of this document.

Internet-Draft    Ad-hoc Resource Lists using SUBSCRIBE         Nov 2003


   The subscriber can update the list by using the defined "create",
   "add", and "delete" primitives. "create" primitive means that the old
   list MUST be removed and replaced with the new data. Consequently,
   "create" primitive with an empty list means that the old list MUST be
   emptied. Adding an already existing resource MUST result in
   triggering of appropriate notifications.

   Deleting of a non-existent resource SHOULD NOT result in an error
   condition. If a subset of the resources specified in (re-)SUBSCRIBE
   cannot be served within the context of this dialog, error or
   redirection indications (preferably specified per resource) SHOULD be
   reported using subsequent NOTIFY(s) in accordance with the
   notification format(s) established for this SUBSCRIBE dialog.

   When any in-band operation is performed  on a resource in the list,
   the RLS SHOULD generate a NOTIFY as if the operation has been
   performed by any possible out-of-band means and in accordance with
   the notification mechanism and the format established for this
   dialog.

4. Example Message Flow

   This message flow illustrates how a User (i.e. watcher) subscribes to
   its Presence Server for a list of resources, receives presence
   information about the resources, manipulates the list and receives
   updated information about the resources.

   When the value of the Content-Length header field is "..." this means
   that the value is whatever the computed length of the body is.

   For brevity some of the headers (e.g. Via, CSeq, and Max-Forwards)
   are omitted from the message flows.

   friends are added to the list and one is deleted.

6. Security Considerations

   The functionality described in this document doesn't introduce new
   security risks beyond described in [7] for subscription to a single
   resource. Note that security considerations related to conveying
   resources' information using NOTIFYs are addressed by corresponding
   drafts (e.g. [8], [9], and [6]).

7. IANA Considerations

7.1 New SIP Option Tag: adhoclist

   This section defines a new option tag for the registry established by
   section 27.1 of RFC 3261[1].

   Option Tag Name: adhoclist

   Description: Extension to allow creation of and subscription to lists
   of resources

   Published specification: RFC xxxx [[Note to RFC editor: replace xxxx
   with the RFC number of this document when published]]

7.2 New MIME type for Resource List Meta-Information

   MIME Media Type Name: application

   MIME subtype name: adrl+xml

   Required parameters: None

   Optional parameters: charset

   See RFC 3023 [12] for a discussion of the charset parameter on
   XML-derived MIME types.  Since this MIME type is used exclusively in
   SIP, the use of UTF-8 encoding is strongly encouraged.

   Encoding considerations: 8-bit text

   Security considerations: Security considerations specific to uses of
   this MIME type are discussed in RFC xxxx [[Note to RFC editor:
   replace xxxx with the RFC number of this document when published]].
   RFC-1874 [4] and RFC-3023 [5] discuss security issues common to all
   uses of XML.

   Interoperability considerations: The use of this MIME body is
   intended to be generally interoperable.  No unique considerations
   have been identified.

   Published specification: RFC xxxx [[Note to RFC editor: replace xxxx
   with the RFC number of this document when published]]

   Applications which use this media type: This media type is used to
   convey meta-information for the state of lists of resources within a
   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) subscription.

   Additional information:

   Magic Number(s): None.

   File Extension(s): None.

   Macintosh File Type Code(s): None.

   Object Identifier(s) or OID(s): None.

   Intended usage: Limited Use

   Other Information/General Comment: None.

7.3 URN Sub-Namespace

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:adrl

   Description: This is the XML namespace URI for XML elements defined
   by [RFCXXXX] to describe identifiers of resources when the
   information about such resources is aggregated within a single SIP
   subscription.  It is used in the application/adrl+xml body type.
