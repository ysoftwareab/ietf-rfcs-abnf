     Abstract 
         
        Assured Service refers to the set of capabilities used to ensure 
        that mission critical communications are setup and remain connected. 
        [Pierce] describes the requirements, one of which is to provide 
        preferential treatment to higher priority calls. IEPS refers to a 
        set of capabilities used to provide a higher probability of call 
        completion to emergency calls made by authorized personnel, usually 
        from ordinary telephones. This also requires some form of 
        preferential treatment. This informational memo describes some of 
        the methods which may be applied to provide that preferential 
        treatment.

     Internet Draft    Examples of Preferential Treatment        April 2004 

     1.   Introduction 
         
        The requirements for Assured Service in support of networks 
        requiring precedence treatment for certain calls is are described in 
        [Pierce]. One of those requirements is Preferential treatment, which 
        is the following: 
         
        It must be possible to provide preferential treatment to higher 
        precedence calls in relation to lower precedence calls. Examples of 
        preferential treatments are: 
         
        - reservation of network resources for precedence calls 
           
        - usage of higher Call Admission Control (CAC) limits for acceptance 
          of new higher precedence calls 
           
        - preferential queuing of signaling messages based on precedence 
          level 
           
        - preferential queuing of user data packets based on precedence 
          level 
           
        - discarding of packets of lower precedence call 
           
        - preemption of one or more existing calls of lower precedence level 
           
        - preemption of some of the resources being used by a call of lower 
          precedence level 
           
        - preemption of the reservation of resources being held for other 
          traffic 
         
        Several documents describe the requirements for provision of the 
        International Emergency Preparedness Scheme (IEPS). This service 
        requires some types of preferential treatment for these calls, which 
        can be viewed as a subset of the requirements for Assured Service 
        listed above. These requirements include: 
         
        - higher probability of call completion 
           
        - lower probability of premature disconnect 
           
        - distinguish IEPS data packets from other types of VoIP Packets in 
          order to give them "priority". 
           
        - alternate path routing 
         
        This informational memo describes some ways in which the above 
        listed preferential treatments may be provided by utilizing current 
        or new capabilities.

     2.   Background 
         
        The requirement for Precedence Level marking of a call setup attempt 
        using SIP [RFC3261] will be met by the Resource Priority header 
        [Resource]. The value carried in this header represents the relative 
        precedence level of the call, and is used to control any of the 
        following described procedures for providing Preferential Treatment. 
         
         
     3.   Potential Preferential Treatments 
         
        The requirement to provide preferential treatment to calls may be 
        met by applying the appropriate combination of the following 
        procedures. Due to the complexity of the network and the protocols 
        being used, it is not expected that any one of these procedures will 
        be sufficient by itself. 
         
        In addition, there may be other procedures and treatments not 
        described herein. 
         
     3.1.  Reservation of Network Resources 
         
        This procedure involves pre-reserving certain network resources 
        during periods when no higher precedence traffic is present so as to 
        be prepared to handle a given level of high precedence traffic in 
        the case of an emergency. While this method is already used in the 
        circuit switched environment, it is less than desirable since it 
        requires a tradeoff between the amount of wasted resources during 
        non-emergency periods and the amount of emergency traffic which can 
        be handled using those reserved facilities. 
         
        IETF defined QoS mechanisms for packet-mode operation offer some 
        improvement to this situation by allowing the amount of reserved 
        resources to be adjusted. 
      
     3.1.1. RSVP 
         
     3.1.1.1.  Reservation of Trunk Groups 
         
        RSVP may be used to establish multiple trunk groups between 
        switching points, with each trunk group serving a different 
        precedence level of calls. Each trunk group would be sized based on 
        the number of simultaneous calls of that precedence level to be 
        supported. (In this context, a trunk group refers to a facility 
        which can support a certain number of voice connections at a certain 
        Quality of Service level. As noted later, the number of connections 
        can be increased with a corresponding decease in the QoS level.) 
         
        With TE, the reserved sizes of these trunk groups could be adjusted 
        during times of emergency. 
         

      
     Mike Pierce              Expires October 2004                 [Page 4] 

     Internet Draft    Examples of Preferential Treatment        April 2004 

        No preemption of these trunk groups is needed. However, reducing the 
        size of a group to near zero would prevent further calls from using 
        it while allowing existing calls to continue. 
         
     3.1.1.2.  Reservation for Individual Calls 
         
        RSVP may be used to establish paths for individual calls (packet 
        flows) with aggregation taking place as described in RFC 3175. This 
        also provides the ability to preempt such as flow. 
         
     3.1.2. MPLS 
         
        MPLS may be used to establish the equivalent of dedicated trunk 
        groups between switching entities, enterprise network, etc. Each of 
        these "trunk groups" could exist to support a specific precedence 
        level of traffic between two points and could be setup using the 
        procedures of CR-LDP [RFC3212] or RSVP-TE [RFC3209]. These support 
        the signaling of the required five levels of precedence. 
         
     3.1.2.1.  Constraint-based LSP Setup using LDP 
         
        CR-LDP [RFC3212] defines an extension to LDP to provide a 
        constraint-based routing using MPLS. One of the constraints is based 
        on the notion of a "priority" level for the new setup. It includes 
        the signaling of a setup priority and a holding priority with the 
        value of each being 0-7 (0 is the highest priority). When setting up 
        an LSP as a trunk group to carry the traffic of one of the expected 
        precedence levels defined in [Pierce], the following mapping would 
        be used: 
         
        +------------------+------------------------+ 
        | Assured Service  | RFC3212 Preemption TLV | 
        | Precedence       +-----------+------------+ 
        | Level            |  SetPrio  |  HoldPrio  | 
        +------------------+-----------+------------+ 
        | Routine          |     4     |     0      | 
        | Priority         |     3     |     0      | 
        | Immediate        |     2     |     0      | 
        | Flash            |     1     |     0      | 
        | Flash Override   |     0     |     0      | 
        +------------------+-----------+------------+ 
         
        This mapping prevents any preemption of a trunk group for the 
        establishment of another. Rather, it is expected that trunk groups 
        for all precedence levels would be initially created and remain. 
        Only their allocated size might be changed. 
         
        If actual preemption were desired, the appropriate HoldPrio values 
        would be used.

     3.1.2.2.  RSVP-TE: Extensions to RSVP for LSP Tunnels 
         
        As an alternative to LDP, RSVP-TE [RFC3209] defines the use of RSVP 
        with extensions to perform the label distribution for MPLS. It also 
        includes the same setup and holding priorities as defined in CR-LDP 
        [RFC3212]. When using RSVP as the label distribution protocol, the 
        same mapping shown above for LDP would be used. 
         
     3.2.  Use of Higher Call Admission Control Limits 
         
        One aspect of preferential treatment may be provided by allowing 
        higher precedence calls to be setup even when they result in 
        exceeding the engineered traffic limit on a facility (on an MPLS 
        LSR, for example). This operation is based on an assumption of 
        normal traffic behavior in which calls are continuously releasing. 
        It also presumes that the actual packet flow for the new call will 
        not be started until some time after call setup, for example, at 
        answer. Any exceeding of the engineered limit is expected to be 
        short-term. 
         
        Note: "Engineered traffic limit" here is intended to mean values, 
        either calculated or obtained through experience, of the limits on 
        loading which can occur and still meet the desired performance, for 
        example, packet loss rate < 0.1%. In some cases, "congestion" means 
        going over this limit. 
         
        This procedure presumes the existence of a Call Admission Control 
        function which is aware of the traffic loading on various links and 
        entities, and compares these against some thresholds before allowing 
        the establishment of a new call (packet flow). 
         
        For example, the limits for Call Admission Control for new calls 
        could be set as depicted in the following table, where the 
        engineered capacity of a route or facility is "x". A new call of 
        each precedence level would be allowed only if the current load is 
        within the limit shown: 
         
        +------------------+-----------+ 
        | Precedence Level | Capacity  | 
        |                  | limit of  | 
        +------------------+-----------+ 
        | Routine          |   .9x     | 
        | Priority         |  .95x     | 
        | Immediate        |     x     | 
        | Flash            | 1.05x     | 
        | Flash-override   |  1.1x     | 
        +------------------+-----------+ 
         
        Explanation of table: In this example, a new Flash call is allowed 
        to be setup if the current traffic load for all traffic on the 
        facility is less than 1.1x. In the example shown in this table, 
        Routine traffic is always prevented from using the last 10% of the 
      
     Mike Pierce              Expires October 2004                 [Page 6] 

     Internet Draft    Examples of Preferential Treatment        April 2004 

        engineered capacity. The choice of the multipliers would be based on 
        an analysis of the tradeoff between getting the high precedence 
        level call through vs. sacrificing its QoS. It would depend on the 
        voice encoding algorithms typically used and the end user 
        expectations. 
         
        Note: As an example, the values in the above table may have been 
        derived from a calculation that, for the codec being used, 
        oversubscribing by 10% will lead to a certain packet loss rate 
        which, although serious, is preferable to blocking the setup of the 
        new Flash override call. 
         
        This procedure is based on a requirement that Flash override calls 
        should "never" be blocked. (In a probability-based system, there is 
        no such thing as "never".) In the circuit-switched environment this 
        could only be guaranteed by having as many circuits as there might 
        be Flash override calls. For IP-based service, there is no fixed 
        number of "circuits" on any facility. The "x" referred to above is 
        only an engineering limit based on a guarantee for the provision of 
        a certain QoS for normal traffic, i.e., Routine and Priority. This 
        "x" may be thought of as the number of "circuits" for normal 
        traffic. It is preferable to allow the setup of additional higher 
        precedence calls with reduced QoS rather than blocking their setup. 
        For example, while a particular facility may support 100 normal 
        calls (Routine and Priority) at the guaranteed QoS, it might support 
        110 flash-override calls at a reduced, yet acceptable, QoS (due to 
        packet loss) when in an emergency situation. 
         
        Since the packet preferential treatment using Diff-Serv described in 
        Section 3.5 could result in the discard or loss of the packets for 
        the lower precedence calls, the higher precedence calls could still 
        be provided a sufficient QoS even though they may have caused the 
        engineered capacity of the route to be exceeded. The lower 
        precedence calls will then experience higher packet discard rates or 
        queuing delay times. If the discard rate or delay for these lower 
        precedence calls is excessive, the end user will experience poor QoS 
        and will likely disconnect, thereby freeing up the resources. 
         
     3.3.  Preferential Queuing of Signaling Messages 
         
        There is no plan to apply preferential queuing to signaling messages 
        (ahead of other signaling messages), just as this was not done in 
        the circuit switched network. No advantage can be shown for such a 
        procedure and it would only aggravate the problem of out-of-order 
        messages. 
         
     3.4.  Preferential Queuing of User Data Packets 
         
        It is not expected that priority queuing of user data packets (ahead 
        of other user data packets of the same type) would provide a useful 
        capability.

     3.5.  Discarding of Packets using DiffServ 
         
        Within DiffServ, Assured Forwarding [RFC2597] provides four classes 
        and three drop precedences for each class (12 DSCP code points). One 
        of these classes could be used for the signaling messages for 
        session establishment and release. AF is not considered as being 
        appropriate for audio. 
         
        Expedited Forwarding [RFC3246] defines a single class (DSCP code 
        point) and operation, but does not include multiple drop precedences 
        as AF does. The intention of EF is to "provide low loss, latency and 
        jitter" and is understood to be intended for traffic such as speech, 
        although RFC 3246 does not explicitly mention speech or voice. 
        However, speech is less susceptible to loss than the signaling 
        traffic and, under some traffic situations, will constitute a much 
        larger portion of the overall load. Therefore, multiple drop 
        precedences to alleviate overload may be more appropriate to EF than 
        they are to AF. 
         
        The result of this use of DiffServ classes is that voice packets are 
        always given priority over the signaling packets and all voice 
        packets are treated the same. While this is the desired behavior in 
        many cases, it is not desired in those cases in which a limited 
        sized facility could become completely occupied by voice traffic 
        (using EF). In this situation, further signaling messages (using 
        AF), including those to setup new high precedence calls and those to 
        release low precedence calls, would be lost or excessively delayed. 
         
        Therefore, it is necessary to reserve a small capacity for use by 
        the AF class which serves the signaling traffic as described in 
        Section 2.10 of EF [RFC3246]. 
         
        For that portion of the capacity using EF for voice, part of the 
        required preferential treatment for the five call precedence levels 
        may be provided by the use of multiple drop precedence (probability) 
        levels for packets. The procedures for these drop precedence levels 
        would be similar to that defined currently for the three levels for 
        each class in AF [RFC2597]. 
         
        Five such levels for packet marking, using DSCPs, are needed to 
        provide the required functionality. In the absence of "standardized" 
        DSCP values, local values could be assigned. Based on the 
        definitions for AF, these levels are referred to here as: 
         
        - Very low (i.e., lowest probability of being dropped) 
        - Low 
        - Medium 
        - High 
        - Very high (i.e., highest probability of being dropped) 
         
        The following possible mappings are shown to illustrate the concept 
        of using DiffServ codepoints to assist in the provision of

        preferential treatment to the individual packets which make up the 
        information transfer (both the connection setup signaling and the 
        voice transfer) of an Assured Service call. 
         
     3.5.1. Treatment for Signaling Packets 
         
        Consideration could be given to utilization of different drop 
        precedences for the signaling messages associated with different 
        precedence sessions. However, using SS#7 in the PSTN as a basis, it 
        might also be meaningful to provide different drop precedences based 
        on the type of message rather than only based on the precedence of 
        the call. For example, for routine traffic, those messages which 
        cause the release of sessions could be given a lower drop precedence 
        than those which set up new sessions in order to allow such releases 
        to take place properly under overload conditions. High precedence 
        calls, on the other hand could use a lower drop precedence level for 
        session setup messages than those of routine precedence calls. The 
        following table shows the Congestion Priority Level assignments 
        defined for SS#7 [T1.111], including High Probability of Completion 
        [T1.631] and MLPP [T1.619], and a suggestion of what might be used 
        for SIP for the corresponding messages. 
         
        (Note: The highest SS#7 Congestion Priority Level, i.e., "3", is the 
        last to be dropped during congestion.) 
         
        (Refer to RFC 3398 for mapping of ISUP to SIP messages.)

     3.5.2. Treatment for Voice Packets 
         
        This example is for the case of the use of DiffServ to provide the 
        packet forwarding preferential treatment through multiple drop 
        precedence levels. It uses the Multi-Level Expedited Forwarding Per 
        Hop Behavior [Silverman]. Each packet containing user data (voice) 
        is marked with a unique DiffServ codepoint to indicate one of the 
        following levels and resulting treatment: 
         
        +--------------+--------------------+-----------------+ 
        |  Precedence  | Indication in user | Drop if current | 
        |     Level    |   voice packets    |  queue is more  | 
        |              +-------+------------+ than -- % full  | 
        |              | Class |    Drop    |     (note 1)    | 
        |              |       | precedence |                 | 
        +--------------+-------+------------+-----------------+ 
        |Routine       | MLEF  |  Very high |      80%        | 
        |Priority      | MLEF  |    High    |      90%        | 
        |Immediate     | MLEF  |   Medium   |     100%        | 
        |Flash         | MLEF  |    Low     |     110%        | 
        |Flash Override| MLEF  |  Very low  |     120%        | 
        +--------------+-------+------------+-----------------+ 
         
        All voice traffic is then served by a single instance of MLEF, and 
        served by a single (strict FIFO) queue. This results is an equal 
        treatment in terms of delay variation (often called "jitter") for 
        all precedence levels for those packets which are delivered, but 
        achieves this by selective packet discard. The discard may use a 
        simple tail dropping algorithm as shown in the above table or a form 
        of "Random Early Detection" as described in [RFC2309] to drop some 
        packets before the queue actually reaches the fill shown above. 
        However, since the packets in this queue are not using TCP and can 
        not be bursty or "aggressive" or of large size, there appears to be 
        no advantage gained by the complexity of early detection and random 
        dropping algorithms. 
         
        Note 1: The "queue full" here refers to the engineered limit, that 
        is, the limit which needs to be applied in order to meet the 
        requirements of the EF PHB and the desired QoS in terms of maximum 
        delay introduced by this queue. Since this calculation of maximum 
        queue length is based on probabilities of achieving a certain target 
        QoS, it can be temporarily exceeded as described in Section 3.6.2. 
        This is shown in the above table by using values greater than 100% 
        for Flash and Flash override. It is essentially this "over-
        subscription" of higher precedence packets which causes packets of 
        the lower precedence calls to be discarded. This presumes that the 
        condition of packet drop will be temporary as calls normally release 
        and new calls are prevented from being established. 
         
        It should be emphasized that selective packet discard based on DSCP 
        (which is based on the call precedence level) can not by itself 
        provide a useful service. Without effective CAC, excess offered

        traffic will lead to congestive collapse, and selective packet 
        discard can not prevent this collapse. 
         
     3.6.  Preemption 
         
     3.6.1. Call Preemption 
         
        If possible, actual preemption of existing calls may be provided in 
        order to achieve the same functionality as previously available in 
        the circuit-switched environment with MLPP, that is, use of the 
        proper notifications sent to the users whose call is being 
        preempted. Such preemption would have to be based on knowledge of: 
        1) the current loads on links, 2) which links require freed-up 
        capacity for a higher precedence call, and 3) which packet flows 
        need to be terminated to free-up that capacity. It would also 
        required appropriate signaling. 
         
        When interworking with circuit switched portions of the 
        telecommunications network, preemption procedures are still required 
        within transport facilities which are based on fixed numbers of 
        circuits. In some cases, this preemption results in specific 
        procedures being applied in the packet portion, such as 
        notifications of preemption and forced disconnect of a call. 
         
     3.6.2. Preemption of Some of the Resources Being Used 
         
        The procedures described above for use of higher call acceptance 
        limits and selective discard of voice packets based on the 
        precedence level of the call may reduce or eliminate the need to 
        perform preemption of existing calls within the IP domain. The 
        statistical nature of packet transmission makes it possible to 
        "squeeze" an additional high precedence call into an already "full" 
        facility, as illustrated in the previous section. It should be noted 
        that, in the extreme case, these procedures would result in a 
        similar effect as preemption, but without the required user 
        notification, since the resources of the lower precedence calls 
        would be so severely degraded (via packet loss) that communication 
        would be impossible and the users would eventually disconnect. 
         
        Because each packet flow arrives at somewhat regular intervals, it 
        is expected that, when packet loss is occurring due to discard, the 
        loss will not be random across all flows using the DSCP with the 
        highest discard probability. Rather, losses will likely be bursty on 
        each flow, with most discards being on one flow for many consecutive 
        packets.

     3.7.  Preemption of the Reservation 
         
        Based on traffic engineering, the amount of resources allocated to 
        reserved paths (e.g., MPLS or RSVP) could be adjusted. For example, 
        when an emergency situation occurs, the need for more resources to 
        support higher priority traffic could be recognized. The existing 
        LSPs could be changed using the procedures of [RFC3214] to allow the 
        size of those LSPs supporting the higher priority traffic to be 
        increased while others are decreased. 
         
     3.8.  Exemption from Network Management Controls 
         
        Network Management controls may sometimes restrict call setup, for 
        example, during times of natural disasters a network may 
        intentionally block calls going into that area in order to reserve 
        facilities for calls coming from that area. One preferential 
        treatment which may be applied to higher precedence calls is to 
        allow them to override such Network Management controls.
