          Enhanced JWT Claim Constraints for STIR Certificates
                   draft-ietf-stir-enhance-rfc8226-00

Abstract

   RFC 8226 provides a certificate extension to constrain the JWT claims
   that can be included in the PASSporT as defined in RFC 8225.  If the
   signer includes a JWT claim outside the constraint boundaries, then
   the recipient will reject the entire PASSporT.  This document defines
   additional ways that the JWT claims can be constrained.

1.  Introduction

   The use of certificates [RFC5280] in establishing authority over
   telephone numbers is described in [RFC8226].

   Section 8 of [RFC8226] provides a certificate extension to constrain
   the JWT claims that can be included in the PASSporT [RFC8225].  If
   the signer includes a JWT claim outside the constraint boundaries,
   then the recipient will reject the entire PASSporT.

   This document defines an enhanced JWTClaimConstraints certificate
   extension, which provides all of the capabilities available in the
   original certificate extension as well as some additional ways to
   constrain the allowable JWT claims.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Enhanced JWT Claim Constraints Syntax

   Certificate subjects are limited to specific values for PASSporT
   claims with the Enhanced JWT Claim Constraints certificate extension;
   issuers permit all claims by omitting the Enhanced JWT Claim
   Constraints certificate extension from the extension field of the
   certificate [RFC5280].  The certificate extension is non-critical,
   applicable only to end-entity certificates, and defined with ASN.1
   [X.680].  The syntax of the JWT claims in a PASSporT is specified in
   [RFC8225].

   The Enhanced JWT Claim Constraints certificate extension is optional,
   but when present, it constrains the JWT claims that authentication
   services may include in the PASSporT objects they sign.  Constraints
   are applied by certificate issuers and enforced by recipients when
   validating PASSporT claims as follows:

   1.  mustInclude indicates JWT claims that MUST appear in the PASSporT
       in addition to the iat, orig, and dest claims.  The baseline
       PASSporT claims ("iat", "orig", and "dest") are considered to be
       permitted by default, and these claims SHOULD NOT be part of the
       mustInclude list.  If mustInclude is absent, the iat, orig, and
       dest claims MUST appear in the PASSporT.

   2.  permittedValues indicates that if the claim name is present, the
       claim MUST contain one of the listed values.

   3.  mustExclude indicates JWT claims that MUST NOT appear in the
       PASSporT. in addition to the iat, orig, and dest claims.  The
       baseline PASSporT claims ("iat", "orig", and "dest") are
       considered to be permitted by default, and these claims MUST NOT
       be part of the mustExclude list.

   4.  excludedValues indicates that if the claim name is present, the
       claim MUST NOT contain any of the listed values.

   The Enhanced JWT Claim Constraints certificate extension is
   identified by the following object identifier (OID):

      id-pe-eJWTClaimConstraints OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pe TBD1 }

   The Enhanced JWT Claim Constraints certificate extension has the
   following syntax:

           -- If the claim name is present, the claim MUST NOT contain
           -- any of the listed values.

         WITH COMPONENTS { ..., permittedValues PRESENT } |

       JWTClaimNames ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF JWTClaimName

       JWTClaimName ::= IA5String

4.  Usage Examples

   Consider these usage examples with a PASSporT claim called
   "confidence" with values "low", "medium", and "high".  These examples
   illustrate the constraints that are imposed by mustInclude,
   permittedValues, mustExclude, and excludedValues:

   *  If a CA issues to an authentication service certificate that
      includes an Enhanced JWT Claim Constraints certificate extension
      that contains the mustInclude JWTClaimName "confidence", then an
      authentication service is required to include the "confidence"
      claim in all PASSporTs it generates and signs; a verification
      service will treat as invalid any PASSporT it receives with a
      PASSporT claim that does not include the "confidence" claim.

   *  If a CA issues to an authentication service certificate that
      includes an Enhanced JWT Claim Constraints certificate extension
      that contains the permittedValues JWTClaimName "confidence" and a
      permitted "high" value, then a recipient authentication service

      will treat as invalid any PASSporT it receives with a PASSporT
      "confidence" claim with a value other than "high".  However, a
      recipient authentication service will not treat as invalid a
      PASSporT it receives without a PASSporT "confidence" claim at all.

   *  If a CA issues to an authentication service certificate that
      includes an Enhanced JWT Claim Constraints certificate extension
      that contains the mustExclude JWTClaimName "confidence", then a
      recipient authentication service will treat as invalid any
      PASSporT it receives with a PASSporT "confidence" claim regardless
      of the claim value.

   *  If a CA issues to an authentication service certificate that
      includes an Enhanced JWT Claim Constraints certificate extension
      that contains the excludedValues JWTClaimName "confidence" and a
      permitted "low" value, then a recipient authentication service
      will treat as invalid any PASSporT it receives with a PASSporT
      "confidence" claim with a value of "low".  However, a recipient
      authentication service will not treat as invalid a PASSporT it
      receives without a PASSporT "confidence" claim at all.

5.  Certificate Extension Example

   A certificate containing an example of the
   EnhancedJWTClaimConstraints certificate extension is provided in
   Figure 1.  The certificate is provided in the format described in
   [RFC7468].  The example of the EnhancedJWTClaimConstraints extension
   from the certificate is shown in Figure 2.  The example imposes four
   constraints:

   1.  The "confidence" claim must be present in the PASSporT.

   2.  The "confidence" claim must have a value of "high" or "medium".

   3.  The "priority" claim must not be present in the PASSporT.

   4.  The "assurance" claim, if present in the PASSporT, must not have
       a value of "low".

   NOTE: This certificate in Figure 1 will need to be corrected once
   IANA assigns the object identifier for the certificate extension.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes use of object identifiers for the Enhanced JWT
   Claim Constraints certificate extension defined in Section 3 and the
   ASN.1 module identifier defined in Appendix A.  Therefore, IANA is
   asked to made the following assignments within the SMI Numbers
   Registry.

   For the Enhanced JWT Claim Constraints certificate extension in the
   "SMI Security for PKIX Certificate Extension" (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.1)
   registry:

         TBD1  id-pe-eJWTClaimConstraints

   For the ASN.1 module identifier in the "SMI Security for PKIX Module
   Identifier" (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.0) registry:

         TBD2  id-mod-eJWTClaimConstraints-2021

7.  Security Considerations

   For further information on certificate security and practices, see
   [RFC5280], especially the Security Considerations section.

   The Enhanced JWT Claim Constraints certificate extension can be used
   by certificate issuers to provide limits on the acceptable PASSporT
   that will be accepted by recipient verification services.
   Enforcement of these limits depends upon proper implementation by the
   recipient verification services.  The digital signature on the
   PASSportT data structure will be valid even if the limits are
   violated.

8.  Acknowledgements

   Many thanks to Chris Wendt for his insight into the need for the for
   the Enhanced JWT Claim Constraints certificate extension.
