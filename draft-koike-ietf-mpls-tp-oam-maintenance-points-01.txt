Internet-Draft     MPLS-TP OAM Maintenance Points           March 2010


Abstract

   MPLS transport profile (MPLS-TP) is designed to enable carrier grade
   packet transport and complement converged packet network deployments.
   Among the most important features of MPLS-TP are comprehensive OAM
   functions which enable network operators or service providers to
   provide various kinds of service characteristics such as prompt fault
   location, substantial survivability, performance monitoring and
   preliminary or in-service measurements.

   For the realization of those features by the MPLS Transport Profile,
   the definition of the maintenance points at which OAM messages are
   initiated, terminated and processed is very important. Based on the
   MPLS-TP OAM requirements this document elaborates on and gives
   guidance about maintenance points in MPLS-TP networks.

   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force
   (IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications
   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
   Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the
   capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network.

Internet-Draft     MPLS-TP OAM Maintenance Points           March 2010


1. Introduction

   A packet transport network will enable carriers or service providers
   to use network resources efficiently and reduce network cost. For
   carrier grade network operation appropriate maintenance operations
   such as prompt fault location, substantial survivability, performance
   monitoring, preliminary and in-service measurement are essential
   factors to ensure quality and reliability of the network. These
   operational characteristics are essential features of transport
   networks and have evolved long with TDM evolution, ATM, SDH and OTN.

   Unlike in SDH or OTN networks where OAM is an inherent part of every
   frame and frames being also transmitted in idle mode, in packet
   networks it is not per se possible to constantly monitor the status
   of individual connections. In other words, packet transport networks
   rely on additional measures, i.e. OAM functions and proper location
   of maintenance points. On the other hand, packet based OAM functions
   are flexible and selectively configurable to operator's needs.

   According to the MPLS-TP OAM requirements [6] mechanisms MUST be
   available for a service provider to be aware of a fault or defect
   affecting the service(s) he provides.

   To ensure that faults can be localized and connections can be traced
   through network elements, links, intra-domain and inter-domain
   interfaces, it is important to define the appropriate location of OAM
   maintenance points which are responsible for processing OAM messages
   and performing OAM functions. If maintenance points are not defined
   properly, any excellent OAM function for pro-active and on-demand
   maintenance may become meaningless or less effective.

   In addition, it is also important to clarify how those OAM
   maintenance points are utilized by each maintenance mechanism, in
   other words, each OAM function. If OAM processing at each OAM
   maintenance point is not clarified, network management view and
   operability of network elements might be unsufficient.

   This document clarifies requirements on OAM maintenance points by
   elaborating on the technical background and on deployment cases.
   Moreover requirements for every OAM function are also clarified based
   on the newly introduced deployment of maintenance points.

3. General characteristics of maintenance operations in transport
   networks

   The following two characteristics (C1-C2) are significant in
   transport networks.

   C1) When a fault occurs with client traffic, it must be possible to
   locate the cause of the fault or defect in client data traffic, that



Koike et al.          Expires September 9, 2010               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft     MPLS-TP OAM Maintenance Points           March 2010


   is, whether it is within one administrative domain or outside the
   domain.

   If a fault occurs in client traffic, it is necessary to identify
   whether the cause is within the responsible operator's administrative
   domain or outside of it. Immediate fault identification and location
   is an important factor for providing effective maintenance actions
   and avoiding high efforts for manual interventions.
   Therefore, C1 is an inevitable characteristic of the transport
   profile.

   C2) When a fault or a defect occurs in a connection within one
   administrative domain, it must be possible to locate whether the
   cause is within a node or between two neighboring nodes.

   If the fault is within one administrative domain, the next action is
   to determine if the problem is located within one node or
   transmission line, i.e. to determine whether it is an equipment alarm
   or communication alarm. The basic reason the two alarms are
   separately defined in a transport network is dependent on the
   characteristic difference of the two network components, the node or
   the transmission line. The performance and quality of the network
   node is mainly determined by the switching or forwarding component,
   whose implementation can differ among system vendors. The performance
   and quality of the transmission line is mainly determined by the line
   card/IF component and physical transmission media. The line card/IF
   package is more generalized and less vendor specific as forwarding
   and switching components. Accordingly, the separation between the
   switching and transmission section is quite reasonable from the
   perspective of architectural design.

   When a fault is detected, it MUST be possible to locate the affected
   component or narrow the causes of the fault. This enables prompt and
   well-directed actions, by e.g. a replacment of packages/line
   cards/modules or by changing settings of the package, port, section,
   or connection unit. Efficiently handling this problem and avoiding
   any effect on other client traffic, which does not encounter faults
   and is not related to the fault, are important.

4.  Location of maintenance points

   OAM maintenance points need to be specified clearly in order to meet
   the MPLS-TP OAM requirements [6] and the characteristics described in
   section 3 of this draft. OAM maintenance points include MEP and MIP.

  4.1. Types of MEP location

   Note: Following sections will be copied to section 3.2 MEG End Points
   (MEPs) of OAM framework[7].

   An end node within a point-to-point MEG will support per-node MEP or
   per-interface MEP.


4.1.1. Per-node MEP

   Per-node MEP is a MEP which is located somewhere within one NE. There
   is no other MIP on the same LSP/PW within the same NE.

                          Source/Destination node
                             -----------------
                            |                 |
                            |      -----      |
                            |     |     |     |
                         ->-|     | MEP |     |->-
                            |     |     |     |
                            |      -----      |
                            |                 |
                             -----------------

                          Figure.1: Per-node MEP

   In this case, the location of MEP within NE is unspecified. In other
   words, MEP is located at ingress interface(I/F), forwarding
   engine(FW), egress I/F, or other parts, if any.

   Note: It is said that most common implementation of MEP in LSP/PW is
   located at ingress interface and the second common one is located at
   FW. However, per-node MEP doesn't restrict its location within one NE.


4.1.2. Per-interface MEP

   Per-interface MEP is a MEP which is located on the interface facing
   the client network (UNI) and being specified independently from
   forwarding engine.
   In the most cases, a per-interface MEP will be combined with a per-
   interface MIP which is located on the interface facing the provider
   network (NNI) on the same LSP/PW within the same NE.

   egress per-interface MEP in source/destination node

   Figure   2   shows   two   examples   of   per-interface   MEP   at
   source/destination node of LSP/PW. In left hand case (1) in fig.2,
   the destination/source MEP is located at the ingress interface before
   the FW in the source node and in right hand case (2) in fig.2, the
   source/destination MEP is located at the egress interface after the
   FW in destination/source node.


  4.2. Types of MIP location

   Note: Following sections will be copied to section 3.3 MEG
   Intermediate Points (MIPs) of the MPLS-TP OAM framework[7].

   An end or intermediate node within a point-to-point MEG will support
   per-node MIP or per-interface MIP.


4.2.1. Per-node MIP

   Per-node MIP is a MIP which is located somewhere within one NE. There
   is no other MIP on the same LSP/PW within the same NE.

                             Intermediate node

                          Figure.3: Per-node MIP

   Fig.3 shows the per-node MIP model. In this model, the location of
   MIP within a node is unspecified. In other words, MIP is located at
   ingress interface (I/F), forwarding engine (FW), egress I/F or other
   part if any.

   Note: In the most cases, per-node MIPs for LSP/PW are located at
   ingress interface or at the FW. However, the location of per-node
   MIPs within one NE isn't constrained to that.


4.2.2. Per-interface MIP

   Per-interface MIP is a MIP which is located on a node interface,
   independently from the forwarding engine.
   In the most cases, per-interface MIP will be combined with another
   per-interface MIP which is located on the egress interface of the
   same LSP/PW within the same NE.

   Figure 4 shows per-interface MIP model. This model has one MIP placed
   at the ingress interface and one MIP placed at the egress interface
   at a source/intermediate/destination node of LSP/PW. An ingress MIP
   is located at the ingress interface before the FW in an
   intermediate/destination node and an egress MIP is located at the
   egress interface after the FW in a source/intermediate node.

5. Dependency of OAM capability and the location of maintenance points

   In this section, the difference of OAM functional capabilities
   between type1 and type2 of locations of maintenance points are
   described.

   One of the most important features for maintenance operation is to
   appropriately set and use points at which fault location, performance
   monitoring or diagnostic test is done. As described in section 4,
   there are mainly two different assignments of maintenance points,
   that is, type1 and type2. In case of type 1 MIP or MEP, only one
   maintenance point exists somewhere within a node. In case of type2
   MIP or MEP, two maintenance points exist per node, i.e. one at the
   ingress interface and one at the egress interface.

   Following section shows the comparison of OAM maintenance
   capabilities between type1 and type2. For type 1, the location of a
   maintenance point (MIP or MEP) is not specified within one NE. Type1
   is basically classified into two options (located at ingress
   interface or at the forwarding engine), when currently deployed
   implementations are considered. The most common location of
   maintenance point of LSP/PW is at ingress interface. Therefore the
   location of maintenance point is assumed at ingress interface in the
   following comparisons.

Internet-Draft     MPLS-TP OAM Maintenance Points           March 2010


   Fig.5 shows the per-node model of maintenance points when some
   connection service is provided between CE1 and CE2. A LSP is
   established between PE1 and PE2. MEP1 in forward direction and MEP1'
   in backward direction are located within a same PE1. In the same
   manner, a pair of MIP1 and MIP1' and a pair of MPE2 and MEP2' are
   located within a same P1 and PE2 respectively.

   In fig.5, MIP and MEP at each label edge router (LER) is located at
   different position within the router in forward direction and
   backward direction respectively for comparison between per-node
   MIP&MEP(fig.5) and per-interface MIP&MEP(fig.6). Strictly speaking,
   in forward direction MEP1 is set at ingress interface of PE1 and MEP2
   is set at ingress interface of PE2. MIP1 is set at ingress interface
   P1. Moreover, MIP1', MEP1' and MEP2' in unidirectional LSP of
   backward direction from egress interface of PE2 to egress interface
   of PE1 is also described.

   Figure 6 shows the per-interface model of maintenance points when
   some connection service is provided between CE1 and CE2. A LSP is set
   between PE1 and PE2. In forward direction, MEP1 is set at ingress
   interface(In) of PE1 and MEP2 is set at egress interface(Out) of PE2.
   MIP1 is set at egress interface of PE1, MIP2 is at in-I/F of P2, MIP3
   is at out-I/F of P3, MIP4 is at in-I/F of PE2. Moreover, LSP of
   backward direction from out-I/F of PE2 to in-I/F of PE1 is also
   described. In this case, MIPs and MEPs at each label edge router are
   located at the same position within the router in forward direction
   and backward direction respectively.

  5.1. Fault location

   The following two cases based on Fig.5 and Fig.6 compare the
   different characteristic between per-node MIP&MEP and per-interface
   MIP&MEP in terms of fault location. Locations of maintenance points
   in per-node MIP&MEP in fig.5 can cause two concrete problems,
   relating to characteristics (C1) and (C2) in section 3.

   The following 2 cases are considered, where on-demand CV is
   exemplified as mechanism for fault location:

   Case 1: Customer traffic between CE1 and CE2 contains a fault and on-
   demand CV from PE1 to PE2 is OK

   Case 2: On-demand CV from PE1 to P fails (NG).

Internet-Draft     MPLS-TP OAM Maintenance Points           March 2010


   Case 1 highlights a scenario where the fault is located in the client
   domain or operator domain. The suspected fault points are forwarding
   engine(FW) in PE2, out-going interface(Out) in PE2, transmission line
   between PE2 and CE2 or CE2.

   In case of the per-node model in fig.5, on-demand CV can only be
   performed on segment2(S2). With only one maintenance point per node,
   it is impossible to precisely identify the fault location.
   In case of per-interface model in fig.6, there are five segments
   where on-demand CV can be performed. Although S2 in fig.5 corresponds
   to S4' in fig.6, on-demand CV can also be conducted in S'5 in case of
   per-interface model in fig.6. Adding MEP2 in PE2 enables to obtain
   additional information and more precisely locate the fault by using
   on-demand CV.

   If the result of on-demand CV in S4' is OK, the fault location range
   can be limited to the transmission line between ME2 and CE2 or out-
   going IF(Out) in PE2. If the result of on-demand CV in S4' is NG, the
   fault is at egress IF(Out) in PE2 or at the forwarding engine in PE2.
   In packet network, miss-configuration might be the cause of
   connection fault more often than hardware failure of packages. As a
   result, per-interface model provide more effective fault location
   function than per-node model.
   Per-interface model makes it easy to locate the cause of the fault or
   defect in client data traffic, that is, whether it is within one
   administrative domain or outside the domain.

   Note: Interaction with client OAM / attachment circuit has to be done
   on another OAM level, i.e. by link OAM or an end-to-end service OAM
   on the client service layer and by OAM message mapping. This is for
   further study.



   Case 2 highlights a scenario where the fault is located on the
   interface or transmission line within operator's domain.

   In case of the per-node model in fig.5, segment1 (S1) is the only
   pattern where on-demand CV can be performed. With only one
   maintenance point per node, it is impossible to precisely identify
   the fault location. On the other hand, in case of per-interface model
   in fig.6, there are five segments in total where on-demand CV can be
   performed. Although S1 in fig.5 corresponds to S2' in fig.6, on-
   demand CV can also be conducted in S'1 in case of per-interface model
   in fig.6. Adding MIP2 in PE1 enables to obtain additional information
   and more precisely locate the fault by using on-demand CV.

Internet-Draft     MPLS-TP OAM Maintenance Points           March 2010


   As explained above, setting maintenance points on both sides of the
   switch fabric in per-interface model enables operators to locate
   faults more precisely and as a result, perform maintenance more
   efficiently than in per-node model. Operators have to indentify the
   location of MEP particularly in per-node model.

   This comparison of maintenance capability is applied to not only on-
   demand CV which is exemplified in this section but also other OAM
   functions such as a proactive continuity check, proactive on-demand
   connectivity verification, on-demand route tracing, on-demand loss
   measurement, on-demand delay measurement and diagnostic test.


  5.2. Performance Monitoring

   According to MPLS-TP OAM requirements, performance monitoring has to
   be supported by loss measurement and delay measurement function.
   Those are supported between two MEPs.

   In case of per-node MEP model as per fig.5, the segment where the
   performance of LSP/PW is monitored is S2 between MEP1 and MEP2 in the
   forward direction. Therefore, if some degrade happened between In and
   Out in PE2, it is impossible to detect the degradation on this
   segment.

   In case of per-interface MEP model as per fig.6, the measurable
   segment is S'5 between MEP1 and MEP2 in the forward direction and
   whole connection is covered end-to-end. There is no segment which is
   not measurable.

   It is highly propable that the LER can become a cause for degradation
   of services. In that case, the difference between per-node model and
   per-interface model could be critical. Operators have to be careful
   about the location of MEP in per-node model.



6. Analysis of MEP&MIP location for different OAM functions

   Note: Following sections will be copied to section 5 OAM Functions
   for proactive monitoring and to 6. OAM Functions for on-demand
   monitoring of the MPLS-TP OAM framework[7]. The most appropriate
   destination will be the passages which describe defects for each OAM
   function.

  6.1. Continuity Check

   There is a difference of defect detection capability between per-
   interface and per-node model. In case of per-node model, maintenance
   points are not specified with in NE, therefore, there is a
   possibility that some defects are not detected depending on the
   location of the defect. In case of per-interface model, there is no
   missing segment where defects can not be detected, compared with per-
   node model.

   In addition, in case of per-interface model, it is possible to
   differentiate whether the cause of the defect(s) is(are) within one
   administrative domain or outside the domain. It is also possible to
   differentiate whether the cause is within a node or between two
   neighboring nodes.

  6.2. Connectivity Verifications

   There is a difference of defect detection capability between per-
   interface and per-node model. In case of per-node model, maintenance
   points are not specified with in NE, therefore, there is a
   possibility that some defects are not detected depending on the
   location of the defect.
   In case of per-interface model, there is no missing segment where
   defects can not be detected.

   In addition, in case of per-interface model, it is possible to
   differentiate whether the cause of the defect(s) is(are) within one
   administrative domain or outside the domain. It is also possible to
   differentiate whether the cause is within a node or between two
   neighboring nodes.

  6.3. Route Tracing

   There is a difference of route tracing capability between per-
   interface and per-node model. In case of per-node model, maintenance
   points are not specified with in NE, therefore, there is a
   possibility that some segments of the route of client traffic within
   operator domain cannot be traced.
   In case of per-interface model, there is no missing segment - the
   route can be traced completely.

   In addition, in case of per-interface model, it is possible to
   differentiate whether the point of the failure of the route tracing
   is(are) within one administrative domain or outside the domain. It is
   also possible to differentiate whether the point is within a node or
   between two neighboring nodes.

  6.4. Diagnostic Test

   There is a difference of diagnostic capability between per-interface
   and per-node model. In case of per-node model, maintenance points are
   not specified with in NE, therefore, there is a possibility that some
   segments of the route of the client traffic within operator domain
   cannot be tested. In case of per-interface model, there is no missing
   segment where the diagnostic test can not be conducted.

   In addition, in case of per-interface model, it is possible to
   differentiate whether the cause of the defect(s) is(are) within one
   administrative domain or outside the domain. It is also possible to
   differentiate whether the cause is within a node or between two
   neighboring nodes.

  6.5. Lock Instruct

   To be incorporated in a future revision of this document, when this
   feature is specified in OAM framework[7].

  6.6. Lock Reporting

   No difference between per-interface and per-node model.
   Function is independent of the location of maintenance points within
   one node.

  6.7. Alarm Reporting

   No difference between per-interface and per-node model.
   Function is independent of the location of maintenance points within
   one node.

  6.8. Remote Defect Indication

   No difference between per-interface and per-node model.
   Function is independent of the location of maintenance points within
   one node.

  6.9. Client Failure Indication

   No difference between per-interface and per-node model.
   CFI is associated with client failure and sent from MEP to MEP as a
   result of detection of client signal fail. Therefore, there is no
   direct impact on its capability.

  6.10. Packet Loss Measurement

   There is a difference of packet loss measurement capability between
   per-interface and per-node model. In case of per-node model, the
   location of maintenance points is not specified within NE, therefore
   there is a possibility that some segments of the route of the client
   traffic within operator domain are not measurable. In case of per-
   interface model, there is no missing segment where the packet loss
   measurement can not be conducted.

   In addition, in case of per-interface model, it is possible to
   differentiate whether the cause of the defect(s) is(are) within one
   administrative domain or outside the domain. It is also possible to
   differentiate whether the cause is within a node or between two
   neighboring nodes.

  6.11. Packet Delay Measurement

   There is a difference of packet delay measurement capability between
   per-interface and per-node model. In case of per-node model, the
   location of maintenance points is not specified within NE, therefore,
   there is a possibility that some segments of the route of the client
   traffic within operator domain are not measurable. In case of per-
   interface model, there is no missing segment where the packet delay
   measurement can not be conducted.

   In addition, in case of per-interface model, it is possible to
   differentiate whether the cause of the defect(s) is(are) within one
   administrative domain or outside the domain. It is also possible to
   differentiate whether the cause is within a node or between two
   neighboring nodes.

7. Requirements for the location of MPLS-TP OAM maintenance points

   According to the MPLS-TP OAM requirements [6] mechanisms MUST be
   available for a service provider to be aware of a fault or defect
   affecting the service(s) he provides, even if the fault or defect is
   located outside of his domain. It is further defined that OAM
   information MUST include identifiers related to the nodes and
   interfaces composing that route.

   MPLS-TP OAM maintenance points need to be specified properly in order
   to meet the requirements and characteristics of transport networks,
   as highlighted by this draft.

   Thus, the following detailed requirements are to be considered in the
   MPLS-TP OAM framework and for the MPLS-TP OAM solutions:

   1) Per-node and per-interface deployment models MUST be supported.

   2) At intermediate nodes, for each PW or LSP it MUST be possible to
   set two MIPs; one MIP on the ingress interface and another MIP on the
   egress interface.

   3) At edge nodes, for each PW or LSP it MUST be possible to set one
   MIP and one MEP; one MIP on the interface facing the provider
   network(NNI) and one MEP on the interface facing the client network
   (UNI).

   4) MEPs have to be set at the time when the PW or LSP is provisioned.
   MIPs have to be set at any time, when it is necessary or required.

8. Security Considerations

   This document does not by itself raise any particular security
   considerations.

9. IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA actions required by this draft.
