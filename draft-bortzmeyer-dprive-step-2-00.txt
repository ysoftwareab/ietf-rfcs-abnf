1.  Introduction and background

   To improve the privacy of the DNS user ([RFC7626]), the standard
   solution is to encrypt the requests with TLS ([RFC7858]).  Just
   encrypting, without authenticating the remote server, leaves the
   user's privacy vulnerable to active man-in-the-middle attacks.
   [RFC7858] and [I-D.ietf-dprive-dtls-and-tls-profiles] describe how to
   authenticate the DNS resolver, in the stub-to-resolver link.  We have
   currently no standard way to authenticate the authoritative name
   server, in the resolver-to-auth link.

   The two cases are quite different: a stub resolver has only a few
   resolvers, and there is typically a pre-existing relationship.  But a
   resolver speaks to many authoritative name servers, without any prior
   relationship.  This means that, for instance, having a static key for
   the resolver makes sense while it would be clearly unrealistic for
   the authoritative server.

   Another difference is that resolvers are typically known by IP
   address (obtained by DHCP or manual configuration) while
   authoritative name servers are known by name (obtained from zone
   delegation).  This makes things easier for techniques similar to
   DANE: the manager of the ns1.example.net name server can always add a

   TLSA record under example.net while she may have problems modifying
   the zone under in-addr.arpa or ip6.arpa.

   The original charter of the DPRIVE working group, in force at the
   time of this draft, says "The primary focus of this Working Group is
   to develop mechanisms that provide confidentiality between DNS
   Clients and Iterative Resolvers" and adds "but it may also later
   consider mechanisms that provide confidentiality between Iterative
   Resolvers and Authoritative Servers".  This document is here for this
   second step, "between Iterative Resolvers and Authoritative Servers".
   It will probably require a rechartering of the group.

2.  Possible solutions

   We can express the problem this way: if we want to use TLS-over-DNS
   to secure the link between the resolver and the authoritative server,
   it would be important to have a standard way to authenticate the
   authoritative server.  Basically, the client will get the public key
   of the server in the TLS session, how will it know that this key is
   the right one?

   Here is a comprehensive list of the four possible solutions to this
   problem.  First, the two where the key (or a hash of it) is available
   somewhere else than in the TLS session.

2.1.  Encode key in name

   We could encode the key in the authoritative server name (as in
   DNScurve [dnscurve] [I-D.dempsky-dnscurve]).  Here is an example of a
   domain using DNScurve: the names of the authoritative name servers
   are a Base-32 encoded form of the server's Curve25519 public key.

   % dig +short NS yp.to
   uz5dz39x8xk8wyq3dzn7vpt670qmvzx0zd9zg4ldwldkv6kx9ft090.ns.yp.to.
   uz5hjgptn63q5qlch6xlrw63tf6vhvvu6mjwn0s31buw1lhmlk14kd.ns.yp.to.
   uz5uu2c7j228ujjccp3ustnfmr4pgcg5ylvt16kmd0qzw7bbjgd5xq.ns.yp.to.

   Securely transmitting the key would therefore be a by-product of
   delegation.  Among the limits of this solution, the length of these
   names limit the number of possible name servers, if we want to keep
   the delegation short.  Also, it requires a cryptographic algorithm
   where keys are short (which means no RSA).

2.2.  Key in DNS

   We could publish keys in the DNS, secured with DNSSEC (as in DANE
   [RFC6698]).  This raises an interesting bootstrap problem: we need to

   have an "unsecure" mode to retrieve the initial key material.  A
   possible algorithm is:

      (0)The resolver remembers the keys of the authoritative name
      servers (in the same way it remembers the lowest RTT among a NS
      RRset),

      (1)When the resolver needs to talk to a server (say
      ns1.example.net) for which it does not know the key, it does a
      TLSA request for _953._tcp.ns1.example.net,

      (2)If the resolution of this request requires to talk to the very
      server we search the key for, the resolver connects to this server
      with TLS to port 953, does not authenticate, and sends the query.
      This step offers no authentication.

   The real algorithm will need to be more complicated since there are
   several servers per zone.  A resolver may use the knowledge of TLS
   authentication it has to choose an authoritative name server among a
   NS RRset.

2.3.  PKIX

   We could use the X.509 security model [RFC5280]).  The certificates
   for authoritative name servers would be signed by regular CAs, with
   the name of the server in the Subject Alternative Name.

   One of the problems is that resolvers will probably have different
   sets of trusted CA so an authoritative name server will not know in
   advance what percentage of the resolvers may authenticate it.

2.4.  Lax security

   Finally, we could simply not check the keys at all, accepting
   anything.  This would break privacy promises, when there is an active
   attacker, able to pose as the authoritative name server.  But it is
   still better, privacy-wise, than the current situation where DNS
   requests are sent in clear text.

3.  Miscellaneous

   A resolver may use a combination of these solutions.  For instance,
   trying PKIX authentication (it does not require an extra lookup,
   except may be OCSP), if it fails, search a TLSA record, if there is
   none, depending on the resolver's policy, accept anyway.

   All these solutions can be improved by things like automatic key
   pinning ([RFC6797]).

   An authoritative name server cannot know if the resolver authentified
   it, and how.  In the future, it may be interesting to have a EDNS
   option to signal a successful authentication, or a failure, but this
   is out of scope currently.

4.  IANA Considerations

   There is currently nothing to do for IANA.  The future chosen
   solution may require some IANA action, such as a registry.

5.  Security Considerations

   For the time being, refer to each subsection under Section 2 to have
   an analysis of its security.
