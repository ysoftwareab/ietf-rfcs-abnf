Internet-Draft          URNs for message headers                Sep 2001


1. Introduction

   This specification defines a form of URI to be used to identify email
   and MIME message headers, defined by RFC 2822 [20]	and related
   documents.  The URI scheme used is 'urn:' as defined by RFC 2141
   [11], and the URN namespace used is 'ietf', defined by RFC 2648 [18]
   and extended by RFC ???? [26]  to include names for IETF protocol
   parameters.

1.1 Message metadata

   Internet message headers convey a range of information about a
   message that can be useful to applications other than those involved
   directly in message transfer and presentation.  Much personal and
   corporate knowledge resides in email and other message stores, and
   message headers are a rich source of metadata about the contents of
   these stores.

   There has been a growth of interest in extracting, storing and using
   metadata about Internet resources, particularly in connection with
   the World Wide Web.  Traditionally, message headers have been used
   during the process of transferring and presenting a message, and
   otherwise pretty much ignored.  This specification aims to facilitate
   the exchange of metadata derived from message headers.

   Much of the work on WWW information and metadata structures is based
   on XML [23].  XML employs an extensibility model, XML namespaces
   [24], that uses URIs to qualify local element and attribute names
   used in an XML document.  One XML-based metadata format developed by
   the World Wide Web consortium is RDF [25]; this uses URIs to identify
   the resources described, and the relationships between them.

   The goal of this specification is to define a URI form for
   identifying Internet message headers, which allows them to be
   incorporated into XML formatted data; e.g.  as in "An XML format for
   mail and other messages" [27].  This form might also be used with
   non-XML specifications that employ a URI-based extensibility model,
   such as the common profile for instant messaging format specification
   [28].

1.2 Definitions of message headers

   RFC 2822 [20] defines a general syntax for Internet message headers.
   It also defines a number of headers to be used with Internet mail.
   Other specifications define additional headers that can appear in an
   Internet message: RFC 1036 [1], RFC 2156 [12], RFC 1496 [2], RFC 1766
   [4], RFC 2183 [13], RFC 1864 [5], RFC 2421[15] and RFC 2045 [6], to
   name a few.

Internet-Draft          URNs for message headers                Sep 2001


   Internet applications that use (some of) these message headers
   include Internet mail [19][20], NNTP newsgroup feeds [1], HTTP web
   access [17] and any other that uses MIME [6] encapsulation of message
   content.

2. Registration template

   The URN sub-namespace for message headers is defined as follows.

   Registry name:
      message-header

   Specification:
      RFC 2822 [16].

   Repository:
      The primary definition of Internet message headers is RFC 2822
      [16].  Currently, there is no IANA registry for Internet message
      headers, and additional header names are defined in a variety of
      standards-track RFC documents, including: RFC 1036 [1], RFC 1496
      [2], RFC 1505 [3], RFC 1766 [4], RFC 1864 [5], RFC 2156 [12], RFC
      2183 [13], RFC 2045 [6], RFC 2110 [8], RFC 2298 [9], RFC 2369
      [10], RFC 2421 [15], RFC 2912 [21] and RFC 2919 [22].

      A summary of defined message headers can be found in RFC 2076 [7],
      and updates [29].

   Index value:
      The header name is the index value.  RFC 2822 allows a header name
      to contain any printable, non-space US-ASCII character (i.e.,
      characters that have US-ASCII codes between 33 and 126,
      inclusive), except colon (":").  Header names are case-
      insensitive.

   URN formation:
      The URN for a message header name is formed as:
      "urn:ietf:params:message-header:<header-name>", where <header-
      name> is the message header index value expressed using lower-case
      letters.

      RFC 2141 [11] defines the format of URNs.  Allowable characters
      include upper- or lower-case ASCII letters, decimal digits, "(",
      ")", "+", ",", "-", ".", ":", "=", "@", ";", "$", "_", "!", "*"
      and "'".  Any other character, or any '%' character, that appears
      as part of a header name should be replaced by its %-encoded
      equivalent (per URI specification [14]); e.g.  '%' is represented
      as '%25', '/' as '%2f', etc.

Internet-Draft          URNs for message headers                Sep 2001


      URNs are defined by RFC 2141 [11] as lexically equivalent if they
      are identical following case normalization of the urn scheme name,
      the namespace name and any %-escaping used.  Header names are
      defined such that upper- and lower-case ASCII characters are not
      distinguished.  Therefore, in forming a URN, all ASCII characters
      in the header name must be expressed in lower case.


3. Examples

   This table lists some header names, and the corresponding urn: URIs.

   From:
      urn:ietf:params:message-header:from

   To:
      urn:ietf:params:message-header:to

   X-Envelope-From:
      urn:ietf:params:message-header:x-envelope-from

   Content-MD5:
      urn:ietf:params:message-header:content-md5


4. IANA considerations

   This document calls for the creation of a new IETF sub-namespace, per
   RFC???? [26].  Registration details are in the preceding section.

5. Security considerations

   No security considerations are introduced by this specification
   beyond those already inherrent in use of message headers.
