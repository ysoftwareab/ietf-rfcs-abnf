1.  Introduction

   In order to help ensure interworking between instant messaging (IM)
   systems that conform to the instant messaging / presence requirements
   [RFC2779], it is important to clearly define protocol mappings
   between such systems.  Within the IETF, work has proceeded on two
   instant messaging technologies:

   o  Various extensions to the Session Initiation Protocol ([RFC3261])
      for instant messaging, in particular the MESSAGE method extension
      [RFC3428].

   o  The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), which
      consists of a formalization of the core XML streaming protocols
      developed originally by the Jabber open-source community; the
      relevant specifications are [RFC6120] for the XML streaming layer
      and [RFC6121] for basic presence and instant messaging extensions.

   One approach to helping ensure interworking between these protocols
   is to map each protocol to the abstract semantics described in
   [RFC3860]; that is the approach taken by
   [I-D.ietf-simple-cpim-mapping] and [RFC3922].  By contrast, the
   approach taken in this document is to directly map semantics from one
   protocol to another (i.e., from SIP/SIMPLE to XMPP and vice-versa),
   since that is how existing systems solve the interworking problem.

   Both XMPP and IM-capable SIP systems enable entities to exchange
   "instant messages".  The term "instant message" usually refers to a

Internet-Draft          SIP-XMPP Interworking: IM             March 2015


   message sent between two entities for delivery in close to real time
   (rather than a message that is stored and forwarded to the intended
   recipient upon request).  This document covers single messages only
   (sometimes called "page-mode" messaging), since they form the lowest
   common denominator for IM.  Separate documents cover "session-mode"
   instant messaging in the form of one-to-one chat sessions
   [I-D.ietf-stox-chat], as well as multi-party chat sessions
   [I-D.ietf-stox-groupchat].  In particular, session-mode instant
   messaging supports several features that are not part of page-mode
   instant messaging, such as a higher level of assurance regarding end-
   to-end message delivery.

   The architectural assumptions underlying such direct mappings are
   provided in [RFC7247], including mapping of addresses and error
   conditions.  The mappings specified in this document cover basic
   instant messaging functionality, i.e., the exchange of a single
   instant message between a SIP user and an XMPP user in either
   direction.  Mapping of more advanced functionality is out of scope
   for this document, but other documents in this "series" cover such
   topics.

2.  Intended Audience

   The documents in this series are intended for use by software
   developers who have an existing system based on one of these
   technologies (e.g., SIP), and would like to enable communication from
   that existing system to systems based on the other technology (e.g.,
   XMPP).  We assume that readers are familiar with the core
   specifications for both SIP [RFC3261] and XMPP [RFC6120], with the
   base document for this series [RFC7247], and with the following IM-
   related specifications:

   o  Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Extension for Instant Messaging
      [RFC3428]

   o  Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol: Instant Messaging and
      Presence [RFC6121]

   Note well that not all protocol-compliant messages are shown (such as
   SIP 100 TRYING messages), in order to focus the reader on the
   essential aspects of the protocol flows.

3.  Terminology

   A number of terms used here are explained in [RFC3261], [RFC3428],
   [RFC6120], and [RFC6121].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

4.  XMPP to SIP

   As described in [RFC6121], a single instant message is an XML
   <message/> stanza of type "normal" sent over an XML stream (since
   "normal" is the default for the 'type' attribute of the <message/>
   stanza, the attribute is often omitted).

   When the XMPP user Juliet <juliet@example.com> wants to send an
   instant message to Romeo, she interacts with her XMPP client, which
   generates an XMPP <message/> stanza.  The syntax of the <message/>
   stanza, including required and optional elements and attributes, is
   defined in [RFC6121] (for single instant messages, Section 5.1 of
   [RFC6121] recommends that the value of the 'to' address be a "bare
   JID" of the form "localpart@domainpart").  The following is an
   example of such a stanza:

   Example 1: XMPP user sends message

   |  <message from='juliet@example.com/yn0cl4bnw0yr3vym'
   |           to='romeo@example.net'>
   |    <body>Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?</body>
   |  </message>

   Upon receiving such a message stanza, the XMPP server needs to
   determine the identity of the domainpart in the 'to' address, which
   it does by following the procedures explained in Section 5 of
   [RFC7247].  If the domain is a SIP domain, the XMPP server will hand
   off the message stanza to an XMPP-to-SIP gateway that natively
   communicates with IM-aware SIP servers.

   The XMPP-to-SIP gateway is then responsible for translating the XMPP
   message stanza into a SIP MESSAGE request from the XMPP user to the
   SIP user:

Internet-Draft          SIP-XMPP Interworking: IM             March 2015


   Example 2: XMPP user sends message (SIP transformation)

   |  MESSAGE sip:romeo@example.net SIP/2.0
   |  Via: SIP/2.0/TCP x2s.example.com;branch=z9hG4bK776sgdkse
   |  Max-Forwards: 70
   |  To: sip:romeo@example.net
   |  From: <sip:juliet@example.com;gr=yn0cl4bnw0yr3vym>;tag=12345
   |  Call-ID: D9AA95FD-2BD5-46E2-AF0F-6CFAA96BDDFA
   |  CSeq: 1 MESSAGE
   |  Content-Type: text/plain
   |  Content-Length: 35
   |
   |  Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?

   The destination SIP server is responsible for delivering the message
   to the intended recipient, and the recipient is responsible for
   generating a response (e.g., 200 OK).

   Example 3: SIP user agent indicates receipt of message

   |  SIP/2.0 200 OK
   |  Via: SIP/2.0/TCP x2s.example.com;branch=z9hG4bK776sgdkse
   |  From: sip:juliet@example.com;tag=12345
   |  To: sip:romeo@example.net;tag=vwxyz
   |  Call-ID: D9AA95FD-2BD5-46E2-AF0F-6CFAA96BDDFA
   |  CSeq: 1 MESSAGE
   |  Content-Length: 0

   As described in [RFC3428], a downstream proxy could fork a MESSAGE
   request, but it would return only one 200 OK to the gateway.

      Note: This document does not specify handling of the 200 OK by the
      XMPP-to-SIP gateway (e.g., to enable message acknowledgements).
      See [I-D.ietf-stox-chat] for a mapping of message acknowledgements
      in the context of one-to-one chat sessions.

   The mapping of XMPP syntax to SIP syntax MUST be as shown in the
   following table.

   Table 1: Message syntax mapping from XMPP to SIP

      +-----------------------------+--------------------------+
      |  XMPP Element or Attribute  |  SIP Header or Contents  |
      +-----------------------------+--------------------------+
      |  <body/>                    |  body of MESSAGE         |
      |  <subject/>                 |  Subject                 |
      |  <thread/>                  |  Call-ID                 |
      |  from                       |  From (1)                |
      |  id                         |  transaction identifer   |

      |  xml:lang                   |  Content-Language        |
      +-----------------------------+--------------------------+

   1.  As shown in the foregoing example and described in [RFC7247], the
       XMPP-to-SIP gateway MUST map the bare JID
       ("localpart@domainpart") of the XMPP sender to the SIP From
       header and include the resourcepart of the full JID as the GRUU
       portion [RFC5627] of the SIP URI.

   2.  Because there is no SIP header field that matches the meaning of
       the XMPP message 'type' values ("normal", "chat", "groupchat",
       "headline", "error"), no general mapping is possible here.

5.  SIP to XMPP

   As described in [RFC3428], a single instant message is a SIP MESSAGE
   request sent from a SIP user agent to an intended recipient who is
   most generally referenced by an Instant Message URI of the form
   <im:user@domain> but who might be referenced by a SIP or SIPS URI of
   the form <sip:user@domain> or <sips:user@domain>.

   When the SIP user Romeo <sip:romeo@example.net> wants to send an
   instant message to Juliet, he interacts with his SIP user agent,
   which generates a SIP MESSAGE request.  The syntax of the MESSAGE
   request is defined in [RFC3428].  The following is an example of such
   a request:

Internet-Draft          SIP-XMPP Interworking: IM             March 2015


   Example 4: SIP user sends message

   |  MESSAGE sip:juliet@example.com SIP/2.0
   |  Via: SIP/2.0/TCP s2x.example.net;branch=z9hG4bKeskdgs677
   |  Max-Forwards: 70
   |  To: sip:juliet@example.com
   |  From: sip:romeo@example.net;tag=vwxyz
   |  Call-ID: 9E97FB43-85F4-4A00-8751-1124FD4C7B2E
   |  CSeq: 1 MESSAGE
   |  Content-Type: text/plain
   |  Content-Length: 44
   |
   |  Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.

   Section 5 of [RFC3428] stipulates that a SIP User Agent presented
   with an im: URI should resolve it to a sip: or sips: URI.  Therefore
   we assume that the Request-URI of a request received by an IM-capable
   SIP-to-XMPP gateway will contain a sip: or sips: URI.  Upon receiving
   the MESSAGE, the SIP server needs to determine the identity of the
   domain portion of the Request-URI or To header, which it does by
   following the procedures explained in Section 5 of [RFC7247].  If the
   domain is an XMPP domain, the SIP server will hand off the MESSAGE to
   an associated SIP-to-XMPP gateway that natively communicates with
   XMPP servers.

   The SIP-to-XMPP gateway is then responsible for translating the
   request into an XMPP message stanza from the SIP user to the XMPP
   user and returning a SIP "200 OK" message to the sender:

   Example 5: SIP user sends message (XMPP transformation)

   |  <message from='romeo@example.net/dr4hcr0st3lup4c'
   |           to='juliet@example.com'>
   |    <body>Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.</body>
   |  </message>

   Note that the stanza handling rules specified in [RFC6121] allow the
   receiving XMPP server to deliver a message stanza whose 'to' address
   is a bare JID ("localpart@domainpart") to multiple connected devices.
   This is similar to the "forking" of messages in SIP.

   The mapping of SIP syntax to XMPP syntax MUST be as shown in the
   following table.

      |  transaction identifier  |  id                         |
      +--------------------------+-----------------------------+

   1.  As shown in the foregoing example and described in [RFC7247], if
       the IM-capable SIP-to-XMPP gateway has information about the GRUU
       [RFC5627] of the particular endpoint that sent the SIP message
       then it MUST map the sender's address to a full JID
       ("localpart@domainpart/resourcepart") in the 'from' attribute of
       the XMPP stanza and include the GRUU as the resourcepart.

   When transforming SIP pager-mode messages, an IM-capable SIP-to-XMPP
   gateway MUST specify no XMPP 'type' attribute or, equivalently, a
   'type' attribute whose value is "normal" [RFC6121].

   See Section 7 of this document about the handling of SIP message
   bodies that contain content types other than plain text.

6.  Message Size

   [RFC3428] specifies that (outside of a media session) the size of a
   MESSAGE request is not allowed to exceed 1300 bytes.  Although in
   practice XMPP instant messages do not often exceed that size, neither
   [RFC6120] nor [RFC6121] sets an upper limit on the size of XMPP
   stanzas.  However, XMPP server deployments usually do limit the size
   of stanzas in order to help prevent denial of service attacks, and
   [RFC6120] states that if a server sets a maximum stanza size then the
   limit is not allowed to be less than 10,000 bytes.  Because of this
   mismatch, an XMPP-to-SIP gateway SHOULD return a <policy-violation/>
   stanza error if an XMPP user attempts to send an XMPP message stanza
   that would result in a SIP MESSAGE greater than 1300 bytes.  Although
   such a gateway might decide to "upgrade" from page mode to session
   mode using the Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) and thus
   treating the instant message as part of a chat session as described
   in [I-D.ietf-stox-chat], such behavior is application-specific and
   this document provides no guidelines for how to complete such an
   upgrade.

Internet-Draft          SIP-XMPP Interworking: IM             March 2015


7.  Content Types

   SIP requests of type MESSAGE are allowed to contain essentially any
   content type.  The recommended procedures for SIP-to-XMPP gateways to
   use in handling these content types are as follows.

   An IM-aware SIP-to-XMPP gateway MUST process SIP messages that
   contain message bodies of type "text/plain" and MUST encapsulate such
   message bodies as the XML character data of the XMPP <body/> element.

   An IM-aware SIP-to-XMPP gateway SHOULD process SIP messages that
   contain message bodies of type "text/html"; if so, a gateway MUST
   transform the "text/html" content into XHTML content that conforms to
   the XHTML-IM Integration Set specified in [XEP-0071].

   Although an IM-aware SIP-to-XMPP gateway MAY process SIP messages
   that contain message bodies of types other than "text/plain" and
   "text/html", the handling of such content types is a matter of
   implementation.

8.  Internationalization Considerations

   Both XMPP and SIP support the UTF-8 encoding [RFC3629] of Unicode
   characters [UNICODE] within messages, along with tagging of the
   language for a particular message (in XMPP via the 'xml:lang'
   attribute and in SIP via the Content-Language header).  Gateways MUST
   map these language tagging mechanisms if they are present in the
   original message.  Several examples follow, using the "XML Notation"
   [RFC3987] for Unicode characters outside the ASCII range.

   Example 6: SIP user sends message

   |  MESSAGE sip:juliet@example.com SIP/2.0
   |  Via: SIP/2.0/TCP s2x.example.net;branch=z9hG4bKeskdgs677

   |    </body>

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests no actions of IANA.

10.  Security Considerations

   Detailed security considerations for instant messaging protocols are
   given in [RFC2779], for SIP-based instant messaging in [RFC3428] (see
   also [RFC3261]), and for XMPP-based instant messaging in [RFC6121]
   (see also [RFC6120]).  The security considerations provided in
   [RFC7247] also apply.

   This document specifies methods for exchanging "page-mode" instant
   messages through a gateway that translates between SIP and XMPP, and
   [I-D.ietf-stox-chat] specifies such methods for "session-mode"
   instant messaging between MSRP and XMPP.  Such a gateway MUST be
   compliant with the minimum security requirements of the textual chat
   protocols for which it translates (i.e., SIP or MSRP and XMPP).

   The addition of gateways to the security model of instant messaging
   specified in [RFC2779] introduces some new risks.  In particular,
   end-to-end security properties (especially confidentiality and
   integrity) between instant messaging clients that interface through a
   gateway can be provided only if common formats are supported.
   Specification of those common formats is out of scope for this
   document.  For instant messages, it is possible to use [RFC3862] and
   [RFC3923], but those methods are not widely implemented.  A more
