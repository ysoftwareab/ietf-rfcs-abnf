<h1><br />Policy Considerations for Internet Protocols<br />draft-morris-policy-cons-00.txt</h1>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>Without doubt the Internet infrastructure developed far beyond the expectations 
       of the original funding agencies, architects, developers, and early users. 
       The society's current use and expectations often lead to the need to take the 
       economical and political context in which technology is deployed into consideration.
</p>
<p>This document aims to make protocol designers aware of the public policy-related 
       questions that may impact standards development. This document contains questions, 
       as opposed to guidelines or strict rules that should in all cases be followed.  
       This document provides a framework for identifying and discussing questions
       of public policy concern and serves as an umbrella for related policy documents.

<a name="rfc.section.1"></a><h3>1.&nbsp;
Introduction</h3>

<p>
   This document suggests public policy questions that the authors 
   believe should be considered and possibly addressed within the IETF 
   when it is working on new or revised standards or protocols.  This 
   document offers questions to be considered, rather than guidelines to 
   be followed.  These questions are somewhat similar to the "Security 
   Considerations" section required in IETF documents.
    
</p>
<p>
   This document is inspired by and directly modeled on RFC 3426 <a class='info' href='#RFC3426'>[RFC3426]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Floyd, S., &ldquo;General Architectural and Policy Considerations,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>, 
   entitled "General Architectural and Policy Considerations" and 
   published by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) in November 2002.  In 
   RFC 3426, the IAB raises architectural questions that should be 
   considered in design decisions, without asserting that there are 
   clear guidelines that should be followed in all cases.  This document 
   attempts to follow in the spirit of RFC 3426 by raising questions to 
   be considered without asserting that any particular answers must be 
   followed. 

</p>
<p>    
   This document is motivated by the recognition that technical design 
   decisions made within the IETF and other standards bodies can have 
   significant impacts on public policy concerns.  One well known and in the meanwhile historical example 
    of this possible impact can be found in the standardization efforts around 
   IPv6 on Ethernet networks.  <a class='info' href='#RFC2464'>[RFC2464]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Crawford, M., &ldquo;Transmission of IPv6 Packets over Ethernet Networks,&rdquo; December&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a>, published in December 1998, 
   specified that the interface identifier of an IPv6 address was constructed in a way that it uses the unique MAC address associated with the Ethernet interface
   adapter.  After the publication of RFC 2464, a significant policy 
   concern arose because the use of the unique and unchangeable MAC 
   address would significantly reduce a user's ability to conduct 
   private and/or anonymous communications using IPv6.  The IETF 
   responded to those concerns by publishing RFC 3041 <a class='info' href='#RFC3041'>[RFC3041]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Narten, T. and R. Draves, &ldquo;Privacy Extensions for Stateless Address Autoconfiguration in IPv6,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a>
   entitled "Privacy Extensions for Stateless Address Autoconfiguration 
   in IPv6" in January 2001. Privacy concerns relating this aspect in IPv6 still exist today.  
   
</p>
<p>
   The goal of this document is that potential public policy impacts of 
   technical design decisions will be identified and considered during 
   the initial design process.  Some would refer to this approach as "privacy by design". 
   This type of policy consideration    already happens in many cases within the IETF, but not in any 
   systematic way or with any assurance that public policy concerns will 
   be identified in most cases. We will provide some examples throught this document.
   
</p>
<p>
   The goal of the document is not to suggest that the IETF 
   should "do" policy in the sense of intentionally conducting extensive 
   debates on public policy issues.  However, many of the actions taken within the IETF have an impact on 
   public policy 
   concerns.  This document seeks to encourage the IETF to acknowledge 
   those times when a design decision might affect a policy concern, so 
   that the community can make a reasoned decision on whether and how to 
   address the concern in the particular situation. 
   
</p>
<p>
   Public policy concerns often cannot be avoid:  Some beneficial technologies might 
   have secondary harmful impacts, and the benefits may 
   outweigh the harms.  More generally, some technologies (such as those 
   that facilitate government surveillance) might intentionally 
   compromise a public concern such as privacy.  Similarly, the inherent 
   goal of some technologies (such as those that discriminate among 
   traffic to provide assured levels of quality of service) might 
   simultaneously be viewed by some as beneficial and by others as 
   harmful. 
   
</p>
<p>
   In all of these cases, there may well be good reasons to develop the 
   technology notwithstanding the asserted harms to a policy concern.  
   The main goal of this document is simply to suggest that impacts on a 
   public concern should not happen without clear recognition of the 
   impacts, and without appropriate consideration of whether it is 
   possible to minimize harmful impacts while still meeting the design 
   requirements.

<a name="rfc.section.2"></a><h3>2.&nbsp;
Scope</h3>

<p> 
   This 
   document cannot possibly predict and identify all possible societal 
   impacts of future IETF protocol and architectural design decisions.  It does try, however, to 
   identify a broad range of possible public policy impacts that 
   experience suggests are most likely to arise.     
</p>
<p> 
   There are two broad categories of public policy impacts that this 
   document does not seek to cover with any thoroughness.  First, this 
   document does not articulate the full range of concerns raised by 
   traditional security problems in the network.  The IETF is already 
   appropriately focused on security issues, and those in the Security 
   Area are well able to identify and articulate the types of technical 
   design decisions that can lead to security problems.  Many of the 
   privacy concerns highlighted in this document raise related security 
   concerns. 
   
</p>
<p>
   Second, this document does not attempt to identify the enormous range 
   of positive societal impacts that flow from network technology.  The 
   vast majority of the work of the IETF -- from the introduction of an 
   entirely new method of Internet use to the fine tuning of an existing 
   routing protocol -- yields concrete and important social benefits.  
   This document does not discuss these positive benefits, but takes as 
   a given that technology proposals will not advance within the IETF
   unless at least some portion of the community views the proposals as 
   beneficial. 
   
</p>
<p>
   This document is by no means an exhaustive list of public policy 
   concerns that relate to the Internet.  This draft has instead focused 
   on policy issues that the authors believe are most likely to arise in 
   the IETF context.  In addition,  the views on public policy varies 
   among countries and cultures to a certain degree.

<a name="rfc.section.3"></a><h3>3.&nbsp;
Terminology</h3>

<p>   
   This document will use a limited number of defined terms, which 
   admittedly will not be precisely applicable in all situations: 
    
</p>
<p> 
   TECHNOLOGY shall refer to a technical standard or innovation being 
   considered within the IETF, whether it is a "new" technology or 
   standard or a modification to an "old" technology or standard. 
    
</p>
<p>
   END USER shall refer to the user at one or the other end of a network 
   communication, or an automated or intelligent proxy for a user 
   located at the end of the communication.  Thus, a concern over, for 
   example, the privacy of the End User would be applicable in cases 
   where a client-side application communicated on behalf of an End 
   User.  In some contexts, a corporation or other organized collection 
   of human users might stand in the role of an End User.  In some but 
   not all contexts, a communication might be from one End User to 
   another End User; in other context, a communication might be between 
   a Service Provider (defined below) and an End User. 
   
</p>
<p>
   ACCESS PROVIDER shall refer to the entity that most directly provides 
   network access to an End User or Service Provider.  In the case of 
   End Users on the public Internet, a Access Provider will often be an 
   Internet Service Provider that provides dedicated or dial-up network 
   access.  In other cases a Access Provider might be a company 
   providing access to its employees, or a university providing access 
   to its students and faculty. 
    
</p>
<p>
   SERVICE PROVIDER shall refer to an entity (human, corporate or 
   institutional) that provides or offers services or content to End 
   Users over the network (regardless of whether charges are sought for 
   such services or content).  Thus, for example, a web site would be 
   viewed as a Service Provider. 
    
</p>
<p>
   A given entity (such as a company offering content on the web) might 
   be viewed as an Access Provider (vis-a-vis its employees), as an End 
   User (vis-a-vis the ISP from which it obtains network access), and as 
   a Service Provider (vis-a-vis End Users elsewhere on the Internet). 
    
</p>
<p>
   TRANSIT PROVIDERS shall refer to one or more entities that transport 
   communications between the Access Providers at either end of a 
   communication.  Transit Providers are often thought to transport 
   packets of communications without regard to their content (other 
   than, of course, their destination), but increasingly some Transit 
   Providers may handle traffic differently depending on the type of 
   traffic. 
    
</p>
<p>
   THIRD PARTY shall refer to any individual or entity other than End 
   Users, Access Providers, Service Providers, and Transit Providers.  
   For a given communication, Third Parties could include, for example, 
   governments seeking to execute lawful interceptions, hackers seeking 
   to interfere with or intercept communications, or in some situations 
   entities that provide, under contract, content or functionality to a

   In some cases the distinction between a Transit Provider and a Third

   among traffic based on characteristics such as its content, sender, 
   or receiver.  Similarly, the line between a Service Provider and a 
   Third Party may blur as more service functions are contracted out.

Potential Public Policy Concerns</h3>

<p>
   Below are brief discussions of common categories of public policy 
   concern that might be raised by technologies developed by the IETF.  
   The discussions are not intended to present comprehensive analyses of 
   the policy concern, but are intended to assist in identifying 
   situations in which the concern is implicated and should be 
   considered.

General Comments</h3>

<p>
   The fundamental design principles of the Internet, including 
   openness, interoperability, and the end-to-end principle, have 
   themselves been critical contributors to the value of the Internet 
   from a public policy perspective.  Thus, as a first rule of promoting 
   healthy public policy impacts, the IETF should continue to maintain 
   and promote the architectural goals that it has historically pursued. 
    
</p>
<p>
   Because of this congruence between architectural values and public 
   policy values, many of the design considerations in RFC 3426 <a class='info' href='#RFC3426'>[RFC3426]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Floyd, S., &ldquo;General Architectural and Policy Considerations,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>, 
   "General Architectural and Policy Considerations" directly promote 
   an Internet that is supportive of good public policy values.  As one 
   of many examples, Section 12.1 of <a class='info' href='#RFC3426'>[RFC3426]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Floyd, S., &ldquo;General Architectural and Policy Considerations,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>  discusses the value of user choice, 
   and quotes <a class='info' href='#CWSB02'>[CWSB02]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Clark, D., Wroslawski, J., Sollins, K., and R. Braden, &ldquo;Tussle in Cyberspace: Defining Tomorrow's Internet,&rdquo; 2002.</span><span>)</span></a> to say that "user empowerment is a basic building 
   block, and should be embedded into all mechanism whenever possible."  
   User choice is a fundamental public policy concern, discussed more 
   below. 
    
</p>
<p>
   <a class='info' href='#CWSB02'>[CWSB02]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Clark, D., Wroslawski, J., Sollins, K., and R. Braden, &ldquo;Tussle in Cyberspace: Defining Tomorrow's Internet,&rdquo; 2002.</span><span>)</span></a>, titled "Tussle in Cyberspace: Defining Tomorrow's 
   Internet," is itself a valuable exploration of the intersection 
   between technology design and public policy concerns.  A key premise 
   of <a class='info' href='#CWSB02'>[CWSB02]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Clark, D., Wroslawski, J., Sollins, K., and R. Braden, &ldquo;Tussle in Cyberspace: Defining Tomorrow's Internet,&rdquo; 2002.</span><span>)</span></a> is that "different stakeholders that are part of the 
   Internet milieu have interests that may be adverse to each other, and 
   these parties each vie to favor their particular interests."  Many of 
   the "tussles" that <a class='info' href='#CWSB02'>[CWSB02]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Clark, D., Wroslawski, J., Sollins, K., and R. Braden, &ldquo;Tussle in Cyberspace: Defining Tomorrow's Internet,&rdquo; 2002.</span><span>)</span></a> analyzes are situations in which public 
   policy considerations should be assessed in making design decisions.  
   More broadly, <a class='info' href='#CWSB02'>[CWSB02]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Clark, D., Wroslawski, J., Sollins, K., and R. Braden, &ldquo;Tussle in Cyberspace: Defining Tomorrow's Internet,&rdquo; 2002.</span><span>)</span></a> provides to technology designers a conceptual 
   framework that recognizes the existence of "tussles" and seeks to 
   accommodate them constructively within a design.

<a name="rfc.section.4.2.1"></a><h3>4.2.1.&nbsp;
Government Censorship</h3>

<p>[Editor's Note: Add more references in an upcoming version of the draft.]
</p>
<p>
   "Censorship" is most commonly thought of as government-imposed 
   control or blocking of access to content.  Many believe that as a 
   matter of public policy, censorship should be minimized or avoided.  
   For example, in May 2003 the Council of Europe stated in its 
   "Declaration on freedom of communication on the Internet" that 
   "Public authorities should not, through general blocking or filtering 
   measures, deny access by the public to information and other 
   communication on the Internet, regardless of frontiers." <a class='info' href='#COE03'>[COE03]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Council of Europe, &ldquo;Declaration on freedom of                    communication on the Internet,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a>.  
   But not all censorship is viewed by all as contrary to public policy.  
   In November 2002 in <a class='info' href='#COE02'>[COE02]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Council of Europe, &ldquo;Additional Protocol to the Convention                    on Cybercrime concerning the criminalisation of acts                    of a racist and xenophobic nature committed through                    computer systems,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>, the same Council of Europe specifically 
   endorsed government regulation of "hate speech" on the Internet. 
    
</p>
<p>
   Harder to identify are technologies not intended for content control 
   but which can be used to censor or restrict access to content.  Any 
   technology that creates or permits bottlenecks or choke-points in the 
   network, through which significant traffic must pass, increases the 
   risk of censorship.  Governments seeking to censor content or 
   restrict access to the Internet will exploit network bottlenecks 
   (albeit often bottlenecks created by network topology not technology 
   standards).     
</p>

<a name="rfc.section.4.2.2"></a><h3>4.2.2.&nbsp;
Private Control of Content</h3>

<p> 
   Governments are not the only entities that attempt to restrict the 
   content to which Internet users have access.  In some cases Access 
   Providers (commonly Internet Service Providers) seek to control the 
   content available to their customers.  Some do so with full knowledge 
   and consent of the customers (to provide, for example, a "family 
   friendly" online experience).  Others, however, favor certain content 
   (for example, that of contractual business partners) over competing 
   content, and do so without the clear understanding of their 
   customers. 
    
</p>
<p>
   Whether such private content control is contrary to public policy 
   will turn on a host of specific considerations (including notice and 
   alternative choice), but undeniably such content control raises 
   policy concerns.  These policy 
   concerns are commonly phrased in terms of discrimination among 
   content, and are discussed more fully in the next section.

<a name="rfc.section.4.3"></a><h3>4.3.&nbsp;
Discrimination Among Users and Content</h3>

<p>
   In a simplistic conception of the early Internet, all traffic of any 
   kind was broken into packets and all packets were treated equally 
   within the network.  This idea has promoted a broad and strong 
   perception of equality within the Internet -- one class of traffic 
   will not take priority over other classes, and a lone individual's 
   packets will be treated the same as a large corporation's packets. 
   
</p>
<p>
   Any technology that moves away from this notion of equality -- even 
   technologies that are clearly beneficial -- raise significant public 
   policy questions, including "who controls the preferential 
   treatment," "who qualifies for it," "will it require additional 
   expenditure to obtain it," and "how great a disparity will it 
   create." 
   
</p>
<p>
   Thus, for example, quality of service and content distribution 
   networks both raise questions about what and who will be favored, 
   whether the rough equality of the Internet will be lost, and whether 
   the financially strong will come to dominate the Internet and make it 
   less useful for the less well off. 
   
</p>
<p> 
   The concern over discrimination addresses both discrimination based 
   on identity of user, and on type of traffic.  Content distribution 
   networks enable, for example, individual web sites able to afford the 
   CDN services to be delivered more quickly than competing web sites 
   that are not able to afford such services.  In contrast, a core focus 
   of quality of service efforts is on the need to provide enhanced 
   levels of service to some types of traffic (e.g., Internet 
   telephony).   
    
</p>
<p>
   Concern about discrimination does not suggest that technologies that 
   handle certain categories of traffic more efficiently should never be 
   pursued.  The concern, however, may in some cases suggest that an 
    efficiency enhancement be structured so as to be available to the 
   broadest classes of traffic or users.

<a name="rfc.section.4.4"></a><h3>4.4.&nbsp;
Competition and Choice</h3>

<p> 
   Critical elements of the Internet's development and success have been 
   the ability to create new and innovative uses of the network, the 
   relative ease in creating and offering competitive services, 
   products, and methods, and the ability of Internet users to choose 
   from a range of providers and methods.  Anything that reduces 
   innovation, competition, or user choice raises significant public 
   policy concerns. 
   
</p>
<p>
   Indeed, the need for competition and user choice is perhaps greater 
   now than in earlier days of the Internet.  There is a greater 
   divergence today in the interests and agendas of users and service 
   providers than in the past, and that divergence makes it more 
   important that users be able to choose among service providers (in 
   part to seek providers that they trust the most). 
   
</p>
<p>
   <a class='info' href='#CWSB02'>[CWSB02]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Clark, D., Wroslawski, J., Sollins, K., and R. Braden, &ldquo;Tussle in Cyberspace: Defining Tomorrow's Internet,&rdquo; 2002.</span><span>)</span></a> extensively addresses the important need for competition and 
   user choice, and provides detailed suggestions and guidelines for 
   Internet designer to consider.

<a name="rfc.section.4.5"></a><h3>4.5.&nbsp;
User Consent</h3>

<p> 
   A familiar public policy concern over user consent focuses on the use 
   of personal data (as discussed more fully below under "Privacy").  
   The usage here, however, has a broader meaning:  the consent (or lack 
   of consent) of a user regarding an action or function executed by or 
   within the network.   
   
</p>
<p>
   Many actions performed using IETF protocols require the specific 
   initiation by a user, and the user's consent can fairly be assumed.  
   Thus, if a user transmits a request using SIP, the Session Initiation 
   Protocol, it is safe to assume that the user consents to the normal 
   handling and execution of the SIP request. 
   
</p>
<p>
   Other actions performed using IETF protocols are not initiated by a 
   user, but are so inherently a part of normal network operations that 
   consent can be assumed.  For example, if in the middle of the network 
   certain packets are slowed by congestion, it is safe to assume 
   sufficient consent for congestion control mechanisms and rerouting of 
   the packets. 
   
</p>
<p>
   Uncertainty about consent arises, however, in areas where IETF 
   protocols can be viewed as deviating from some conception of 
   "normal."  A simple example relates to the evolution of caching, 
   where as caching of various types of data became the norm, there 
   emerged a need to be able to set flags to prevent caching, which in a 
   sense can be thought of as a form of negative consent. 
   
</p>
<p>
   Middle boxes and other functions that deviate from the historic 
   "norm" -- the end-to-end principle -- also can raise issues of 
   consent.  For example, Section 3 of <a class='info' href='#RFC3238'>[RFC3238]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Floyd, S. and L. Daigle, &ldquo;IAB Architectural and Policy Considerations for Open Pluggable Edge Services,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>, titled "IAB 
   Architectural and Policy Considerations for Open Pluggable Edge 
   Services," explores a range of consent and data integrity issues 
   raised by the OPES protocol proposals.  As that analysis makes clear, 
   the consent issue is not necessarily confined to the consent of the 
   client in a client/server transaction, but may also involve the 
   consent of the server to an action undertaken on the request of the 
   client.

<a name="rfc.section.4.7"></a><h3>4.7.&nbsp;
Accessibility</h3>

<p>
   The concept of "accessibility" addresses the ability of persons with 
   disabilities to use the Internet in general and the full range of 
   applications and network functions that are commonly available to 
   persons without disabilities. 
   
</p>
<p>
   The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) Technical Activity illustrates the 
   concern and explains that a focus on accessibility is needed "to 
   ensure that the full range of core technologies of the Web are 
   accessible . . . .  Barriers exist when these technologies lack 
   features needed by users with visual, hearing, physical, cognitive or 
   neurological disabilities, or when the accessibility potential in the 
   technology is not carried through into the Web application or Web 
   content.  For instance, in order for a multimedia presentation to be 
   accessible to someone who is blind, the markup language for the 
   presentation must support text equivalents for images and video; the 
   multimedia player used must support access to the text equivalents; 
   and the content author must make appropriate text equivalents 
    available. These text equivalents can then be rendered as speech or 
   braille output, enabling access to the content regardless of 
   disability or device constraints." 
   
</p>
<p>   
   Many policy concerns about accessibility relate specifically to the 
   user interfaces used by applications, and as such these concerns 
   generally fall outside of the province of the IETF.  But in the 
   Applications Area and to a lesser extent elsewhere within the IETF, 
   some design decisions could ultimately constrain the accessibility of 
   applications based on IETF protocols. 
   
</p>
<p>
   The W3C's WAI initiative reflects a very well developed and comprehensive analysis of the 
   technical and design issues raised by accessibility concerns.

<a name="rfc.section.4.8"></a><h3>4.8.&nbsp;
Personal Privacy</h3>

<p>
   Individual privacy concerns are often divided into two components:  
   First, "consumer privacy" (also termed "data protection") commonly 
   addresses the right of individuals to control information about 
   themselves generated or collected in the course of commercial 
   interactions.  Second, "privacy rights vis-a-vis the government" 
   addresses individuals' protection against unreasonable government 
   intrusions on privacy, including the interceptions of communications.   
   
</p>
<p>
   In the IETF context, a third category of privacy concern -- privacy 
   against private interception of or attacks on data or communications 
   -- is largely covered by the IETF's focus on security considerations.  
   Although security considerations are crucial to privacy 
   considerations, "consumer privacy" and "privacy vis-a-vis the 
   government" raise significantly different issues than traditional 
   security considerations.  With security considerations, a key focus 
   is on maintaining the privacy of information against unauthorized 
   attack.  Other forms of privacy, however, focus not on unauthorized 
   access to information, but on the "secondary use" of information for 
   which access was (at least temporarily) authorized.  The question 
   often is not "how can I keep you from seeing my information" but "how 
   can I give you my information for one purpose and keep you from using 
   it for another." 
    
</p>
<p>
   The questions raised in <a class='info' href='#questions'>Section&nbsp;5<span> (</span><span class='info'>Questions about Technical Characteristics or Functionality</span><span>)</span></a> above do not differentiate between 
   the different categories of privacy, because for most purposes within 
   the IETF, technologies that create risk for one type of privacy 
   likely also create risk for other types of privacy.  Once a potential 
   privacy concern is identified, however, the different types of 
   privacy concern may present different public policy considerations.  
   Indeed, the policy considerations may well be in tension -- a 
   technology that permits a lawful governmental interception of a 
   communication may also increase the risk of unlawful private 
   interception. 
   
</p>
<p>  
   Privacy considerations are too numerous and multifaceted to be 
   adequately addressed in this document. For a more detailed treatment please 
   refer to <a class='info' href='#I-D.morris-privacy-considerations'>[I&#8209;D.morris&#8209;privacy&#8209;considerations]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Aboba, B., Morris, J., Peterson, J., and H.

Privacy vis-a-vis the Government</h3>

<p>
   Although privacy is internationally recognized as a human right, most 
   governments claim the authority to invade privacy through the 
   following means, among others: 
    </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>interception of communications in real-time;  
     
</li>
<li>interception of traffic data (routing information) in real-time;  
      
</li>
<li>access to data stored by service providers, including traffic 
   data being stored for billing purposes; and  
      
</li>
<li>access to data stored by users.  
    
</li>
</ul><p> 
    
</p>
<p>
   These means of access to communications and stored data should be 
   narrowly defined and subject to independent controls under strict 
   standards.  Real-time interception of communications should take 
   place only with prior approval by the judicial system, issued under 
   standards at least as strict as those for police searches of private 
   homes. 
    
</p>
<p>
   In 1999, in the "Raven" discussions, the IETF considered whether it 
   should take action to build wiretapping capability into the Internet.  
   Ultimately, as detailed in <a class='info' href='#RFC2804'>[RFC2804]<span> (</span><span class='info'>IAB and IESG, &ldquo;IETF Policy on Wiretapping,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a>, the community decided that an 
   effort to build wiretapping capability into the Internet would create 
   significant and unacceptable security risks.
