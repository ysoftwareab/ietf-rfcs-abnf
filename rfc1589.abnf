time_adj = 0;                /* tick adjust (scaled 1 / HZ) */

         The time_adj variable is the adjustment added to the value of
         tick at each timer interrupt. It is computed once each second
         from the time_offset, time_freq and, if the PPS signal is
         present, the ps_ybar variable once each second.
pps_disp = MAXFREQ;     /* dispersion estimate (scaled ppm) */

         The pps_disp variable represents the average sample dispersion
         measured over the last three samples. It is scaled in the same
         units as the time_freq variable.

pps_dispmax = MAXFREQ / 2; /* dispersion threshold */

         The pps_dispmax variable is used as a dispersion threshold. If
         pps_disp is less than this threshold, the median sample is used
         to update the pps_ybar estimate; if not, the sample is
         discarded.

pps_dispinc = MAXFREQ >> (PPS_SHIFT + 4); /* pps dispersion
pps_shift = PPS_SHIFT;       /* interval duration (s) (shift) */

         The pps_shift variable determines the duration of the
         calibration interval, 1 << pps_shift s.

pps_intcnt = 0;              /* intervals at current duration */

         The pps_intcnt variable counts the number of calibration
         intervals at the current interval duration. It is reset to zero
         after four intervals and when the interval duration is changed.
