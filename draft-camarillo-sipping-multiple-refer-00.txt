Abstract

   This document defines extensions to the SIP REFER method so that this
   method can be used to refer to multiple resources. These extensions
   include the use of pointers to URI-lists in the Refer-To header
   field, the use of bodies to describe the requests to be sent by the
   server, and the use of a new event package to report the state of
   several transactions.

Internet-Draft               Multiple REFER                February 2004


1. Introduction

   The need for exploders in SIP [2] is described in [6]. Mechanisms to
   invoke exploders in SIP need to meet the requirements listed there.

   The SIP REFER method [4] allows a user agent to request a server to
   send a request to a third party. Still, a number of applications need
   to request a server to initiate transactions towards a set of
   destinations. We define several extensions to REFER so that REFER can
   be used to refer to multiple destinations (e.g., a user agent
   requesting a conferencing server to INVITE several new participants).

2. Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
   RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as
   described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [1] and indicate requirement levels for
   compliant implementations.

   We define the following three new terms:

      REFER-Issuer: the UA issuing the REFER request.

      REFER-Recipient: the UA receiving the REFER request.

      REFER-Target: the UA designated in the Refer-To URI.


3. Carrying Multiple Destinations

   We represent the multiple REFER-Targets of a REFER using a URI list.
   We use the Refer-To header field to carry a pointer to that URI-list.

   draft-camarillo-sipping-uri-list provides rules to carry a pointer to
   a URI list in a URI parameter called list. Refer-To header fields
   carring a pointer to a URI-list follow the same rules. That is, the
   Refer-To header field of REFER with multiple REFER-Targets MUST
   contain a URI that points to a URI list. The XCAP resource list
   format [5] MUST be supported; any other URI list formats MAY be
   supported.

   The following is an example of a REFER with a Refer-To header field
   that points to a URI list which is carried in the message body. The
   option-tag "multiple-refer" in the Require header, which is defined
   in Section 5, ensures that the REFER-Recipient understands Refer-To
   header fields with pointers to URI lists.

4. The Transaction State Event Package

   REFER requests establish an implicit subscription to the "refer"
   event package, defined in [4]. The data format used in this event
   package is message/sipfrag, which is defined in [3]. The REFER
   specification says the following about the NOTIFIES triggered by the
   REFER's implicit subscription:

      Each NOTIFY MUST contain an Event header field with a value of
      refer and possibly an id parameter.

      Each NOTIFY MUST contain a body of type "message/sipfrag".

   We keep the first statement, but relax the second statement (about
   the body format) so that the refer event package is aligned with any
   other event package. That is, the notifier can choose any format that
   is applicable to the event package and that appears in the Accept
   header field of the request that created the subscription (the REFER,
   in our case). The resulting normative statement is the following:

Internet-Draft               Multiple REFER                February 2004


      The notifications generated by the server MUST be in one of the
      formats specified in the Accept header field in the REFER request.

   The default format, which MUST be supported by all UAs that generate
   REFERs with the option-tag "multiple-refer" in a Require header
   field, is "application/transaction-info+xml", as defined in
   (draft-camarillo-sipping-transac-package).

   The following is an example of the body of a NOTIFY generated by the
   REFER-Recipient of the REFER in Figure 1.


   <?xml version="1.0"?>
      <transaction-info xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:transaction-info"
                   version="0"
                   state="full"
                   entity="sip:b@atlanta.example.com">
        <transaction id="frgd870th87" r-uri="sip:bill@example.com">
          <state code="200">complete</state>
        </transaction>
        <transaction id="234f12345" r-uri="sip:joe@example.com">
          <state code="404">complete</state>

        <transaction id="fghd2345" r-uri="sip:ted@example.com">

        </transaction>
      </transaction-info>

5. The Multiple-Refer SIP Option-Tag

   We define a new SIP option-tag for the Require and Supported header
   fields: multiple-refer.

   A UA including the multiple-refer option-tag in a Supported header
   understands Refer-To header fields that point to URI lists and
   understands the "application/transaction-info+xml" body type.

   A UA generating a REFER with a pointer to a URI-list in its Refer-To
   header field MUST include the multiple-refer option-tag in the
   Require header field of the REFER.

Internet-Draft               Multiple REFER                February 2004


6. The Template Disposition-Type

   When using REFER, the new request to be sent is described using URI
   parameters. For example, the following Refer-To header field contains
   the values of the Accept-Contact and Call-ID header fields of the new
   request.


   Refer-To: <sip:bob@biloxi.example.net?Accept-Contact=sip:bobsdesk.
          biloxi.example.net&Call-ID%3D55432%40alicepc.atlanta.example.com>

   REFERs with multiple REFER-Targets usually request that the
   REFER-Recipient sends a set of similar requests. Describing a set of
   similar requests by adding the same URI parameters to all the URIs in
   the definition of the URI list is not an efficient way to encode that
   information.

   We define a new disposition-type: template. Bodies of this
   disposition-type (typically sipfrag bodies as defined in RFC 3420
   [3]) provide the server with a template for the messages to be sent.

   The following example shows a body whose disposition-type is
   template. It indicates that the requests to be sent should be
   MESSAGEs carrying the text "Hello world."


   Content-Disposition: template;handling=required
   Content-type: message/sipfrag
   Content-Length: xxx

   MESSAGE sip:whoever.invalid SIP/2.0
   Content-Type: text/plain
   Content-Length: 12

   Hello World.

   If any of the URIs defining the REFER-Targets has a URI parameter
   indicating a different value for a header field than the one
   indicated in the template, the exploder MUST use the value in the URI
   parameter.

   Note that in order to include the method in a sipfrag body, it is
   necessary to include the Request-URI as well (the whole Request-line
   needs to be included as specified in RFC 3420 [3]. If the REFER
   request contains a single REFER-Target, the URI of the Request-Target
   SHOULD be placed in the Request-URI of the template body. Otherwise,
   it is RECOMMENDED that the Request-URI in the template body is an
   invalid URI.

   OPEN ISSUE: we may want to define an option-tag for this
   disposition-type, or to include support for this disposition type in
   the multiple-refer option tag.

7. Example

   We need to add the whole call flow.

8. Security Considerations

   TBD

9. IANA Considerations

   TBD: we need to register the multiple-refer option-tag and the
   template disposition type.
