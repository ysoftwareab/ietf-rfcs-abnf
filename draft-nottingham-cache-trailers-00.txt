1.  Introduction

   Web content that is "dynamically" generated -- i.e., with the
   response body streamed by the server to the client as it is created
   -- is often assumed to be uncacheable.  In practice, though, there
   are some scenarios where caching is beneficial; for example, when a
   private cache might be able to reuse a personalised, dynamic response
   for a period, or when such a response can be shared by a number of
   clients.

   A server choosing a caching policy for such a response faces a
   conundrum: if an error or other unforeseen condition happens during
   the generation of the response, that caching policy might be too
   liberal.  Currently, the only available solutions are to:

   1.  prevent or severely curtail downstream caching, or

   2.  buffer the response until a caching policy can be confidently
       assigned.

   In both cases, performance suffers; in the former, caching efficiency
   is less than it could be in the common case, In the latter, the
   server consumes additional resources and delays the response.

   This specification provides a third solution: updating the caching
   policy in HTTP trailer fields, after the content has been sent.
   Doing so allows content to be streamed, while caching policy can be
   determined after the content is actually generated.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  The "trailer-update" HTTP Cache Directive

   The "trailer-update" cache response directive indicates that the
   caching policy for that response (as indicated by the header field
   that contains the directive) might be updated by a corresponding
   trailer field.

   When it is present as a cache directive in a header field and a
   trailer field with the same field name is received, a cache that
   implements this specification MUST completely replace the stored
   header field value for that response with the trailer field's value,
   MUST update its handling of that response to account for the new
   field value (after any outstanding requests are satisfied), and MUST
   use that value for the header field in responses to future requests
   satisfied from that cache entry (i.e., the trailer field is
   "promoted" to a header field).

   In responses where the trailer field value has replaced the header
   field value, the "trailer-update" directive will have been removed as
   part of that process.  Note that the presence of "trailer-update"
   does not guarantee that a trailer field will follow.

   Caches MAY temporarily store a response that has a caching policy
   with both the "no-store" and "trailer-update" directives, but MUST
   NOT reuse that response until the caching policy is updated in a
   manner that allows it.  If the caching policy is not updated or the
   "no-store" directive is still present in the updated response, the
   cache MUST immediately and permanently discard the temporarily stored
   response.

   For purposes of calculating a stored response's age
   ([I-D.ietf-httpbis-cache], Section 4.2.3), caches receiving such a
   trailer SHOULD consider the response_time to be when the trailer is
   received, but only when calculating resident_time (not
   response_delay, as that would be counterproductive for the purpose of
   estimating network delay).

2.1.  Examples

   Given a resource that supports this specification but encounters no
   errors in the generation of a response's content, that response might
   look like this:

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: text/html
   Cache-Control: max-age=3600, trailer-update

   [body]

   Caches that do not implement this specification will cache it by the
   header policy; caches that do implement will see no updates in the
   trailer and do the same.

   If a change in caching policy is encountered during the generation of
   the response content, the resource can prevent reuse by caches that
   implement this specification by sending:

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: text/html
   Cache-Control: max-age=3600, trailer-update

   [body]
   Cache-Control: no-store

   In this case, caches that do not implement this specification will
   again act as instructed by the header policy, but caches that do
   implement will see the update in the trailers and prevent reuse of
   the response after the trailer is received (although it might have
   been used to satisfy requests that were received in the meantime).

   If a resource wishes to prevent non-implementing caches from storing
   the response, they can send:

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: text/html
   Cache-Control: no-store; trailer-update

   [body]
   Cache-Control: max-age=3600

   Here, a non-implementing cache will only see "no-store", and so will
   not store the response.  An implementing cache can optimistically
   store the response based upon "trailer-update", but only allow its
   reuse after the caching policy is updated to something which permits
   that in trailers.

   Note that when a downstream cache does not implement this
   specification, and also does not forward a message's trailer section
   (as allowed by HTTP), any updates will effectively be lost, even if
   further downstream caches do implement.
