1. Introduction

The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) issued in March 2003 a set 
of RFCs for Internationalized Domain Names (IDN) [N1, N2, N3] are
supposed to become the de facto standard for all languages.  In 2007, 
new versions of the internet-drafts proposing the revisions to the IDNA
protocol have been released and are as follows:

   - Klensin, J., "Internationalizing Domain Names for Applications 
   (IDNA): Issues and Rationale", Work in Progress, November 2007.
   - Klensin, J., "Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications 
   (IDNA): Protocol", Work in Progress, November 2007.
   - Alvestrand, H. and Karp, C., "An IDNA problem in right-to-left 
   scripts", Work in Progress, July 2007.
   - Faltstrom, P., "The Unicode Codepoints and IDN", Work in Progress,
   November 2007.

This document constitutes a technical specification for the 
implementation of the IDN standards in the case of the Arabic Language.
It will allow the use of standard language tables to write domain names
in Arabic characters.  Therefore, it should be considered as a logical
extension to the IDN standards.

This document reflects the recommendations of the Arab Working Group on
Arabic Domain Names (AWG-ADN) established by The League of Arab States
(LAS), based on standardisation efforts of the United Nations Economic
and Social Commission for Western Asia (UN-ESCWA) and its Internet-
Draft: Farah, et al. "Guidelines for an Arabic Internet Domain Name"
(draft-farah-adntf-adns-guidelines-03.txt).

The key words "MUST", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "RECOMMENDED", and "MAY" in	
this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

2. Arabic Language-Specific Issues

Farah, et al.                  Standards Track                  [Page 2]
Internet-Draft            Linguistic Guidelines            February 2008

The main objective of the creation of Arabic Domain Names is to have a
vehicle to increase Internet use amongst all strata of the Arabic-
speaking communities.

Furthermore, a non-user friendly Domain Name would further add to the
ambiguity and the eccentricity of the Internet to the Arabic-speaking 
communities, thus contributing negatively to the spread of the Internet 
and leading to further isolation of these communities at the global
level.

Hence, there have been intensive efforts especially those spearheaded by
Dr. Al-Zoman and contributed to by UN-ESCWA and its Arabic Domain Names
Task Force (ADN-TF) to reach consensus on a multitude of linguistic
issues with the following goals:

   - To define the accepted Arabic character set to be used for writing
   domain names in Arabic; which is the subject of this document.
   - To define the top-level domains of the Arabic domain name tree
   structure (i.e., Arabic gTLDs and ccTLDs).  This goal will be handled
   in a separate document.

The first meeting of the AWG-ADN, held in Damascus January-February 
2005, gave special attention to the following:

   (a) Simplification of the domain names, whenever possible, to
   facilitate
   the interaction of the Arabic user with the Internet.
   (b) Adoption of solutions that do not lead to confusion either in
   reading or in writing, provided that this does not compromise the 
   linguistic correctness of used words.
   (c)Mixing Arabic and non-Arabic letters in the domain name is not 
   acceptable.

   2.1 Linguistic issues

   There are a number of linguistic issues that have been proposed with
   respect to the use of the Arabic language in domain names.  This
   section will highlight some of them.  This section is based on a the
   paper of Dr Al-Zoman [I1] and the report of the first meeting of 
   AWG-ADN [N4].  For details the reader is encouraged review the	
   references.

      2.1.1. Tashkeel (diacritics) and Shadda

      Both Tashkeel and Shadda must not be supported in the zone file,
      yet they can be supported only in the user interface, and stripped
      off at the preparation of internationalized strings (stringprep)
      phase.  The following are their Unicode presentations:

         U+064B ARABIC FATHATAN
         U+064C ARABIC DAMMATAN 
         
Farah, et al.                  Standards Track                  [Page 3]
Internet-Draft            Linguistic Guidelines            February 2008
         
         U+064D ARABIC KASRATAN
         U+064E ARABIC FATHA
         U+064F ARABIC DAMMA
         U+0650 ARABIC KASRA
         U+0651 ARABIC SHADDA
         U+0652 ARABIC SUKUN

      2.1.2. Kasheeda or Tatweel (Horizontal Character Size Extension)

      Kasheeda (U+0640 ARABIC TATWEEL) must not be used in Arabic domain
      names.

      2.1.3. Character folding

      Character folding is the process where multiple letters (that may
      have some similarity with respect to their shapes) are folded into
      one shape.  This includes:

         - Folding Teh Marbuta (U+0629) and Heh (U+0647) at the end of a
         word;
         - Folding different forms of Hamzah (U+0622, U+0623, U+0625, 
         U+0627);
         - Folding Alef Maksura (U+0649) and Yeh (U+064A) at the end of
         a word;
         - Folding Waw with Hamzah Above (U+0624) and Waw (U+0648).

      With respect to the Arabic language, character folding is not 
      acceptable because it changes the meaning of words and it is 
      against the principle of spelling rules.  Replacing a character 
      with another character, which may have a similar shape, will give 
      a different meaning.  This will lead to have only one word 
      representing several words consisting of all the combinations of
      folded characters.  Hence, the other words will be masked by a 
      single word [I1].

      Mis-spelling or handwriting errors do occur leading to mixing 
      different characters despite the fact that this is not the case in
      published and printed materials.  One of the motivations of this 
      effort is to preserve the language particularly with the spread of
      the globalization movement.  Within this context, character 
      folding is working against this motivation since it is going to
      have a negative affect on the principle and ethics of the 
      language.  Technology should work for preserving the language and
      not for destroying it.  Thus, character folding should not be 
      allowed.
	
   2.2 Supported Character Set

   A domain name to be written in Arabic must be composed of a sequence
   of the following UNICODE characters.  These are based on UNICODE 
   version 5.0.

   2.3 Arabic Linguistic Issues Affected By Technical Constraints

   In this section, technical aspects of some linguistic issues are 
   discussed.

      2.3.1. Numerals

      In the Arab countries, there are two sets of numerical digits 
      used:
         - Set I: (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) mostly used in the 
         western part of the Arab world.
         - Set II: (u+0660, u+0661, u+0662, u+0663, u+0664, u+0665, 
         u+0666, u+0667, u+0668, u+0669) mostly used in the eastern part
         of the Arab world.

      Although visual differentiation between the Arabic zero (u+0660)
      and the dot (u+002E) in printed material is possible (the zero is
      larger in size and is printed higher than the dot), using it in 
      domain names may lead to confusion.  Folding set II to set I will
      eliminate the problem of the zero, in specific, and that of 
      numerals in general.

      Both sets may be supported in the user interface but both must be
      folded to one set (Set I) at the preparation of internationalized
      strings (e.g., "stringprep") phase; i.e. storage of numerals in 
      the zone file is done in ASCII format.

      2.3.2. The Space Character

      The space character is strictly not allowed in domain names, as it
            
Farah, et al.                  Standards Track                  [Page 6]
Internet-Draft            Linguistic Guidelines            February 2008

     is a control character.  Instead, the hyphen (Al-sharta) 
     (i.e.u+02D) is proposed as a separator between Arabic words: 
     confusion can take place if the words are typed without a 
     separator, unlike in ASCII.

      It is acceptable to use the hyphen to separate between words 
      within the same domain name label.

3. Security Considerations

No particular security considerations could be identified regarding the
use of Arabic characters in writing domain names.  In particular, any
potential visual confusion between different character strings is 
avoided using the guidelines proposed in this document.

4. IANA Considerations

This document has no action for IANA.

5. Conclusion

The proposed guidelines are in full accordance with the IETF IDN 
standards and take into account Arabic language-specific issues within a
compromise between grammatical rules of the Arabic language and the ease
of use of the language on the Internet.
