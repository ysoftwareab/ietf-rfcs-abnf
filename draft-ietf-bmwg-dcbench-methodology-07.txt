1.  Introduction

   Traffic patterns in the data center are not uniform and are
   constantly changing. They are dictated by the nature and variety of
   applications utilized in the data center. It can be largely east-west
   traffic flows in one data center and north-south in another, while
   others may combine both. Traffic patterns can be bursty in nature and
   contain many-to-one, many-to-many, or one-to-many flows. Each flow
   may also be small and latency sensitive or large and throughput
   sensitive while containing a mix of UDP and TCP traffic. All of these
   can coexist in a single cluster and flow through a single network
   device simultaneously. Benchmarking of network devices have long used
   [RFC1242], [RFC2432], [RFC2544], [2] and [3] which have largely been

   focused around various latency attributes and Throughput [2] of the
   Device Under Test (DUT) being benchmarked. These standards are good
   at measuring theoretical Throughput, forwarding rates and latency
   under testing conditions; however, they do not represent real traffic
   patterns that may affect these networking devices.

   The following provides a methodology for benchmarking Data Center DUT
   including congestion scenarios, switch buffer analysis, microburst,
   head of line blocking, while also using a wide mix of traffic
   conditions. The terminology [1] is a pre-requisite.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


1.2. Methodology format and repeatability recommendation

   The format used for each section of this document is the following:

   -Objective

   -Methodology

   -Reporting Format: Additional interpretation of RFC2119 terms: 

   MUST: required metric or benchmark for the scenario described
   (minimum)

   SHOULD or RECOMMENDED: strongly suggested metric for the scenario
   described

   MAY: Comprehensive metric for the scenario described

   For each test methodology described, it is critical to obtain
   repeatability in the results. The recommendation is to perform enough
   iterations of the given test and to make sure the result is
   consistent. This is especially important for section 3, as the
   buffering testing has been historically the least reliable. The
   number of iterations SHOULD be explicitly reported. The relative
   standard deviation SHOULD be below 10%.


2. Line Rate Testing

2.1 Objective

   Provide a maximum rate test for the performance values for
   Throughput, latency and jitter. It is meant to provide the tests to
   perform, and methodology to verify that a DUT is capable of
   forwarding packets at line rate under non-congested conditions.


2.2 Methodology

   A traffic generator SHOULD be connected to all ports on the DUT. Two
   tests MUST be conducted: a port-pair test [RFC 2544/3918 section 15
 


Avramov & Rapp          Expires November 1, 2017                [Page 5]

INTERNET-DRAFT    Data Center Benchmarking Methodology      May 30, 2017


   compliant] and also in a full mesh type of DUT test [2889/3918
   section 16 compliant]. 

   For all tests, the percentage of traffic per port capacity sent MUST
   be 99.98% at most, with no PPM adjustment to ensure stressing the DUT
   in worst case conditions. Tests results at a lower rate MAY be
   provided for better understanding of performance increase in terms of
   latency and jitter when the rate is lower than 99.98%. The receiving
   rate of the traffic SHOULD be captured during this test in % of line
   rate.

   The test MUST provide the statistics of minimum, average and maximum
   of the latency distribution, for the exact same iteration of the
   test.

   The test MUST provide the statistics of minimum, average and maximum
   of the jitter distribution, for the exact same iteration of the test.

   Alternatively when a traffic generator CAN NOT be connected to all
   ports on the DUT, a snake test MUST be used for line rate testing,
   excluding latency and jitter as those became then irrelevant. The
   snake test consists in the following method: 

   -connect the first and last port of the DUT to a traffic generator

   -connect back to back sequentially all the ports in between: port 2
   to 3, port 4 to 5 etc to port n-2 to port n-1; where n is the total
   number of ports of the DUT

   -configure port 1 and 2 in the same vlan X, port 3 and 4 in the same
   vlan Y, etc. port n-1 and port n in the same vlan ZZZ.

   This snake test provides a capability to test line rate for Layer 2
   and Layer 3 RFC 2544/3918 in instance where a traffic generator with
   only two ports is available. The latency and jitter are not to be
   considered with this test.



2.3 Reporting Format

   The report MUST include:

   -physical layer calibration information as defined into Data Center
   Benchmarking Terminology (draft-ietf-bmwg-dcbench-terminology)
   section 4.

   -number of ports used
 


Avramov & Rapp          Expires November 1, 2017                [Page 6]

INTERNET-DRAFT    Data Center Benchmarking Methodology      May 30, 2017


   -reading for "Throughput received in percentage of bandwidth", while
   sending 99.98% of port capacity on each port, for each packet size
   from 64 bytes to 9216 bytes. As guidance, an increment of 64 byte
   packet size between each iteration being ideal, a 256 byte and 512
   bytes being are also often used. The most common packets sizes order
   for the report is: 64b,128b,256b,512b,1024b,1518b,4096,8000,9216b.

   The pattern for testing can be expressed using RFC 6985 [IMIX Genome:
   Specification of Variable Packet Sizes for Additional Testing]

   -Throughput needs to be expressed in % of total transmitted frames

   -For packet drops, they MUST be expressed as a count of packets and
   SHOULD be expressed in % of line rate

   -For latency and jitter, values expressed in unit of time [usually
   microsecond or nanosecond] reading across packet size from 64 bytes
   to 9216 bytes

   -For latency and jitter, provide minimum, average and maximum values.
   If different iterations are done to gather the minimum, average and
   maximum, it SHOULD be specified in the report along with a
   justification on why the information could not have been gathered at
   the same test iteration

   -for jitter, a histogram describing the population of packets
   measured per latency or latency buckets is RECOMMENDED

   -The tests for Throughput, latency and jitter MAY be conducted as
   individual independent trials, with proper documentation in the
   report but SHOULD be conducted at the same time.




3. Buffering Testing

3.1 Objective

   To measure the size of the buffer of a DUT under
   typical|many|multiple conditions. Buffer architectures between
   multiple DUTs can differ and include egress buffering, shared egress
   buffering SoC (Switch-on-Chip), ingress buffering or a combination.
   The test methodology covers the buffer measurement regardless of
   buffer architecture used in the DUT.

3.2 Methodology

 


Avramov & Rapp          Expires November 1, 2017                [Page 7]

INTERNET-DRAFT    Data Center Benchmarking Methodology      May 30, 2017


   A traffic generator MUST be connected to all ports on the DUT.

   The methodology for measuring buffering for a data-center switch is
   based on using known congestion of known fixed packet size along with
   maximum latency value measurements. The maximum latency will increase
   until the first packet drop occurs. At this point, the maximum
   latency value will remain constant. This is the point of inflection
   of this maximum latency change to a constant value. There MUST be
   multiple ingress ports receiving known amount of frames at a known
   fixed size, destined for the same egress port in order to create a
   known congestion condition. The total amount of packets sent from the
   oversubscribed port minus one, multiplied by the packet size
   represents the maximum port buffer size at the measured inflection
   point.

   1) Measure the highest buffer efficiency

   First iteration: ingress port 1 sending line rate to egress port 2,
   while port 3 sending a known low amount of over-subscription traffic
   (1% recommended) with a packet size of 64 bytes to egress port 2.
   Measure the buffer size value of the number of frames sent from the
   port sending the oversubscribed traffic up to the inflection point
   multiplied by the frame size.

   Second iteration: ingress port 1 sending line rate to egress port 2,
   while port 3 sending a known low amount of over-subscription traffic
   (1% recommended) with same packet size 65 bytes to egress port 2.
   Measure the buffer size value of the number of frames sent from the
   port sending the oversubscribed traffic up to the inflection point
   multiplied by the frame size.

   Last iteration: ingress port 1 sending line rate to egress port 2,
   while port 3 sending a known low amount of over-subscription traffic
   (1% recommended) with same packet size B bytes to egress port 2.
   Measure the buffer size value of the number of frames sent from the
   port sending the oversubscribed traffic up to the inflection point
   multiplied by the frame size.

   When the B value is found to provide the largest buffer size, then
   size B allows the highest buffer efficiency.

   2) Measure maximum port buffer size

   At fixed packet size B determined in procedure 1), for a fixed
   default DSCP/COS value of 0 and for unicast traffic proceed with the
   following:

   First iteration: ingress port 1 sending line rate to egress port 2,
 


Avramov & Rapp          Expires November 1, 2017                [Page 8]

INTERNET-DRAFT    Data Center Benchmarking Methodology      May 30, 2017


   while port 3 sending a known low amount of over-subscription traffic
   (1% recommended) with same packet size to the egress port 2. Measure
   the buffer size value by multiplying the number of extra frames sent
   by the frame size.

   Second iteration:  ingress port 2 sending line rate to egress port 3,
   while port 4 sending a known low amount of over-subscription traffic
   (1% recommended) with same packet size to the egress port 3. Measure
   the buffer size value by multiplying the number of extra frames sent
   by the frame size.

   Last iteration: ingress port N-2 sending line rate traffic to egress
   port N-1, while port N sending a known low amount of over-
   subscription traffic (1% recommended) with same packet size to the
   egress port N. Measure the buffer size value by multiplying the
   number of extra frames sent by the frame size.

   This test series MAY be repeated using all different DSCP/COS values
   of traffic and then using Multicast type of traffic, in order to find
   if there is any DSCP/COS impact on the buffer size.

   3) Measure maximum port pair buffer sizes

   First iteration: ingress port 1 sending line rate to egress port 2;
   ingress port 3 sending line rate to egress port 4 etc. Ingress port
   N-1 and N will respectively over subscribe at 1% of line rate egress
   port 2 and port 3. Measure the buffer size value by multiplying the
   number of extra frames sent by the frame size for each egress port.

   Second iteration: ingress port 1 sending line rate to egress port 2;
   ingress port 3 sending line rate to egress port 4 etc. Ingress port
   N-1 and N will respectively over subscribe at 1% of line rate egress
   port 4 and port 5. Measure the buffer size value by multiplying the
   number of extra frames sent by the frame size for each egress port.

   Last iteration: ingress port 1 sending line rate to egress port 2;
   ingress port 3 sending line rate to egress port 4 etc. Ingress port
   N-1 and N will respectively over subscribe at 1% of line rate egress
   port N-3 and port N-2. Measure the buffer size value by multiplying
   the number of extra frames sent by the frame size for each egress
   port.

   This test series MAY be repeated using all different DSCP/COS values
   of traffic and then using Multicast type of traffic.

   4) Measure maximum DUT buffer size with many to one ports

   First iteration: ingress ports 1,2,... N-1 sending each [(1/[N-
 


Avramov & Rapp          Expires November 1, 2017                [Page 9]

INTERNET-DRAFT    Data Center Benchmarking Methodology      May 30, 2017


   1])*99.98]+[1/[N-1]] % of line rate per port to the N egress port.

   Second iteration: ingress ports 2,... N sending each [(1/[N-
   1])*99.98]+[1/[N-1]] % of line rate per port to the 1 egress port.

   Last iteration: ingress ports N,1,2...N-2 sending each [(1/[N-
   1])*99.98]+[1/[N-1]] % of line rate per port to the N-1 egress port.

   This test series MAY be repeated using all different COS values of
   traffic and then using Multicast type of traffic.

   Unicast traffic and then Multicast traffic SHOULD be used in order to
   determine the proportion of buffer for documented selection of tests.
   Also the COS value for the packets SHOULD be provided for each test
   iteration as the buffer allocation size MAY differ per COS value. It
   is RECOMMENDED that the ingress and egress ports are varied in a
   random, but documented fashion in multiple tests to measure the
   buffer size for each port of the DUT.


3.3 Reporting format

   The report MUST include:

    - The packet size used for the most efficient buffer used, along
   with DSCP/COS value

    - The maximum port buffer size for each port

    - The maximum DUT buffer size

    - The packet size used in the test

    - The amount of over-subscription if different than 1%

    - The number of ingress and egress ports along with their location
   on the DUT

    - The repeatability of the test needs to be indicated: number of
   iteration of the same test and percentage of variation between
   results for each of the tests (min, max, avg)

   The percentage of variation is a metric providing a sense of how big
   the difference between the measured value and the previous ones. 

   For example, for a latency test where the minimum latency is
   measured, the percentage of variation of the minimum latency will
   indicate by how much this value has varied between the current test

   executed and the previous one. 

   PV=((x2-x1)/x1)*100 where x2 is the minimum latency value in the
   current test and x1 is the minimum latency value obtained in the
   previous test. 

   The same formula is used for max and avg variations measured. 

4 Microburst Testing

4.1 Objective

   To find the maximum amount of packet bursts a DUT can sustain under
   various configurations. 

4.2 Methodology

   A traffic generator MUST be connected to all ports on the DUT. In
   order to cause congestion, two or more ingress ports MUST send bursts
   of packets destined for the same egress port. The simplest of the
   setups would be two ingress ports and one egress port (2-to-1). 

   The burst MUST be sent with an intensity of 100%, meaning the burst
   of packets will be sent with a minimum inter-packet gap. The amount
   of packet contained in the burst will be trial variable and increase
   until there is a non-zero packet loss measured. The aggregate amount
   of packets from all the senders will be used to calculate the maximum
   amount of microburst the DUT can sustain.

   It is RECOMMENDED that the ingress and egress ports are varied in
   multiple tests to measure the maximum microburst capacity.

   The intensity of a microburst MAY be varied in order to obtain the
   microburst capacity at various ingress rates.

   It is RECOMMENDED that all ports on the DUT will be tested
   simultaneously and in various configurations in order to understand
   all the combinations of ingress ports, egress ports and intensities. 

   An example would be:

   First Iteration: N-1 Ingress ports sending to 1 Egress Ports

   Second Iterations: N-2 Ingress ports sending to 2 Egress Ports

   Last Iterations: 2 Ingress ports sending to N-2 Egress Ports

   The report MUST include:

    - The maximum number of packets received per ingress port with the
   maximum burst size obtained with zero packet loss

    - The packet size used in the test

    - The number of ingress and egress ports along with their location
   on the DUT

    - The repeatability of the test needs to be indicated: number of
   iterations of the same test and percentage of variation between
   results (min, max, avg) 


5. Head of Line Blocking

5.1 Objective

   Head-of-line blocking (HOL blocking) is a performance-limiting
   phenomenon that occurs when packets are held-up by the first packet
   ahead waiting to be transmitted to a different output port. This is
   defined in RFC 2889 section 5.5, Congestion Control. This section
   expands on RFC 2889 in the context of Data Center Benchmarking.

   The objective of this test is to understand the DUT behavior under
   head of line blocking scenario and measure the packet loss.

5.2 Methodology

   In order to cause congestion in the form of head of line blocking,
   groups of four ports are used. A group has 2 ingress and 2 egress
   ports. The first ingress port MUST have two flows configured each
   going to a different egress port. The second ingress port will
   congest the second egress port by sending line rate. The goal is to
   measure if there is loss on the flow for the first egress port which
   is not over-subscribed.


   A traffic generator MUST be connected to at least eight ports on the
   DUT and SHOULD be connected using all the DUT ports.

   1) Measure two groups with eight DUT ports

   First iteration: measure the packet loss for two groups with
   consecutive ports

   The first group is composed of: ingress port 1 is sending 50% of

   traffic to egress port 3 and ingress port 1 is sending 50% of traffic
   to egress port 4. Ingress port 2 is sending line rate to egress port
   4. Measure the amount of traffic loss for the traffic from ingress
   port 1 to egress port 3. 

   The second group is composed of: ingress port 5 is sending 50% of
   traffic to egress port 7 and ingress port 5 is sending 50% of traffic
   to egress port 8. Ingress port 6 is sending line rate to egress port
   8. Measure the amount of traffic loss for the traffic from ingress
   port 5 to egress port 7.

   Second iteration: repeat the first iteration by shifting all the
   ports from N to N+1.

   The first group is composed of: ingress port 2 is sending 50% of
   traffic to egress port 4 and ingress port 2 is sending 50% of traffic
   to egress port 5. Ingress port 3 is sending line rate to egress port
   5. Measure the amount of traffic loss for the traffic from ingress
   port 2 to egress port 4. 

   The second group is composed of: ingress port 6 is sending 50% of
   traffic to egress port 8 and ingress port 6 is sending 50% of traffic
   to egress port 9. Ingress port 7 is sending line rate to egress port
   9. Measure the amount of traffic loss for the traffic from ingress
   port 6 to egress port 8.

   Last iteration: when the first port of the first group is connected
   on the last DUT port and the last port of the second group is
   connected to the seventh port of the DUT.

   Measure the amount of traffic loss for the traffic from ingress port
   N to egress port 2 and from ingress port 4 to egress port 6.


   2) Measure with N/4 groups with N DUT ports

   The traffic from ingress split across 4 egress ports (100/4=25%).

   First iteration: Expand to fully utilize all the DUT ports in
   increments of four. Repeat the methodology of 1) with all the group
   of ports possible to achieve on the device and measure for each port
   group the amount of traffic loss.

   Second iteration: Shift by +1 the start of each consecutive ports of
   groups

   Last iteration: Shift by N-1 the start of each consecutive ports of
   groups and measure the traffic loss for each port group.

   For each test the report MUST include:

   - The port configuration including the number and location of ingress
   and egress ports located on the DUT

   - If HOLB was observed in accordance with the HOLB test in section 5

   - Percent of traffic loss

   - The repeatability of the test needs to be indicated: number of
   iteration of the same test and percentage of variation between
   results (min, max, avg) 

6. Incast Stateful and Stateless Traffic 

6.1 Objective

   The objective of this test is to measure the values for TCP Goodput
   [4] and latency with a mix of large and small flows. The test is
   designed to simulate a mixed environment of stateful flows that
   require high rates of goodput and stateless flows that require low
   latency.

6.2 Methodology

   In order to simulate the effects of stateless and stateful traffic on
   the DUT, there MUST be multiple ingress ports receiving traffic
   destined for the same egress port. There also MAY be a mix of
   stateful and stateless traffic arriving on a single ingress port. The
   simplest setup would be 2 ingress ports receiving traffic destined to
   the same egress port. 

   One ingress port MUST be maintaining a TCP connection trough the
   ingress port to a receiver connected to an egress port. Traffic in
   the TCP stream MUST be sent at the maximum rate allowed by the
   traffic generator. At the same time, the TCP traffic is flowing
   through the DUT the stateless traffic is sent destined to a receiver
   on the same egress port. The stateless traffic MUST be a microburst
   of 100% intensity.

   It is RECOMMENDED that the ingress and egress ports are varied in
   multiple tests to measure the maximum microburst capacity.

   The intensity of a microburst MAY be varied in order to obtain the
   microburst capacity at various ingress rates.

   It is RECOMMENDED that all ports on the DUT be used in the test.

   For example:

   Stateful Traffic port variation:

   During Iterations number of Egress ports MAY vary as well.

   First Iteration: 1 Ingress port receiving stateful TCP traffic and 1
   Ingress port receiving stateless traffic destined to 1 Egress Port

   Second Iteration: 2 Ingress port receiving stateful TCP traffic and 1
   Ingress port receiving stateless traffic destined to 1 Egress Port

   Last Iteration: N-2 Ingress port receiving stateful TCP traffic and 1
   Ingress port receiving stateless traffic destined to 1 Egress Port

   Stateless Traffic port variation:

   During Iterations, the number of Egress ports MAY vary as well. First
   Iteration: 1 Ingress port receiving stateful TCP traffic and 1
   Ingress port receiving stateless traffic destined to 1 Egress Port

   Second Iteration: 1 Ingress port receiving stateful TCP traffic and 2
   Ingress port receiving stateless traffic destined to 1 Egress Port

   Last Iteration: 1 Ingress port receiving stateful TCP traffic and N-2
   Ingress port receiving stateless traffic destined to 1 Egress Port

6.3 Reporting Format

   The report MUST include the following:

   - Number of ingress and egress ports along with designation of
   stateful or stateless flow assignment.

   - Stateful flow goodput

   - Stateless flow latency

   - The repeatability of the test needs to be indicated: number of
   iteration of the same test and percentage of variation between
   results (min, max, avg)

7.  Security Considerations

   Benchmarking activities as described in this memo are limited to
   technology characterization using controlled stimuli in a laboratory

   environment, with dedicated address space and the constraints
   specified in the sections above.

   The benchmarking network topology will be an independent test setup
   and MUST NOT be connected to devices that may forward the test
   traffic into a production network, or misroute traffic to the test
   management network.

   Further, benchmarking is performed on a "black-box" basis, relying
   solely on measurements observable external to the DUT/SUT.

   Special capabilities SHOULD NOT exist in the DUT/SUT specifically for
   benchmarking purposes. Any implications for network security arising
   from the DUT/SUT SHOULD be identical in the lab and in production
   networks.

8.  IANA Considerations

   NO IANA Action is requested at this time.
