Abstract

     
     The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) [LDAPV3] is gaining
     widespread	acceptance as a	method for accessing Internet directories.
     Many of the LDAP clients accessing	these directories also provide
     support for emitting the directory	information in the form	of a vCard
     electronic	business card object.

     The schema	defined	by this	memo should be used when accessing a
     directory via LDAP	Version	3 and the X.500	family of protocols and
     searching or retrieving directory information based on vCard related
     attributes.  The schema describes the attribute types and object
     classes that have a 1-to-one correspondence with vCard properties.

1.  Introduction

   This	specification proposes a mapping between LDAP and vCard	for use	as
   an online address book.

   The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol [LDAPV3] defines a	standard
   protocol for	accessing Internet directory services.	A common purpose
   for such directory services is the collection of directory information
   related to people and resources.  The vCard Electronic Business Card
   Format [VCARD] defines a standard format for	exchanging information
   about people	and resources.	These two standards are	linked by their
   technical foundations on the	International Telecommunications Union
   Recommendations for The Directory Services [X500].  However,	up to this
   point a more	formal correlation between the two standards has been
   missing.  This memo links the two standards by defining the LDAP schema
   to be used for LDAP-based access to a directory, when the resultant
   information is intended to be in the	form of	the attributes that make up
   a vCard object.

   The [VCARD] specification defines a relatively flat schema.	Each
   instance of a vCard is a container for a set	of peer	attributes, which
   vCard calls properties.  These attributes describe various facets of	a
   physical person or resource in terms	of their identification, delivery
   addressing, telecommunications addressing, geographical, organizational,
   explanatory and security properties.	 Additionally, non-standardized,
   implementation-specific attributes may be present.  With minor
   exceptions, all of the features of the [VCARD] specification	are
   supported by	this schema.


2.  Notation
   The notation	used to	describe object	classes	and attribute types in this
   memo	is the same that is used in [LDAPSYN].	The ABNF used in this memo
   is the same as in [ABNF].

   The use of the terms	attribute and property are used	interchangeably	in
   this	memo.

   The object identifier (OID) used by this schema is rooted at:

	     "1.3.6.1.4.1.2309.1.1.1.1".

   The Internet	Mail Consortium	(IMC) is the authority for the name spaced
   under this root object identifier.


3.  Object Naming
   This	attribute provides the RDN for the object.  This attribute is based
   on the Common Name attribute	of [X.500], as defined in [VCARD].  Values
   should adhere to the	guidelines for the Common Name attribute, as
   specified in	[LDAPV3].

   In addition,	the uniqueID attribute may be present to provide a method


<TBD>				     2		   Expires January 2001
Internet Draft		     LDAP vCard	Schema		    August 22, 2000


   for correlating different vCardObject objects that refer to the same
   physical person or resource,	yet contain differing descriptions.  For
   example, a single person or resource	might be described by a	Canadian-
   French language-based vCardObject and also an US-English language-based
   vCardObject.	 This would be accomplished by both vCardObjects containing
   the uniqueID	property with the same value.

   The uniqueID	attribute is also used to refer	to the vCardObject
   corresponding to the	physical person	or resource in the agent property.


4.  Grouping
   The [VCARD] specification supports to forms of grouping or collections.
   The "vCard Grouping"	capability permits a vCardObject to be the
   container for a sequence of one or more vCardObjects.  For example a
   vCardObject describing a work group might consist of	the vCardObjects
   for each member of that work	group.	The vCard Grouping is not supported
   by this memo.

   The "Property Grouping" capability permits individual attributes within
   a vCard object to be	further	grouped	by the pre-concatenation of a
   textual, group label.  For example the telephone number and delivery
   label for a vacation	residence might	be prefixed with a group label of
   "VACATION.".	 Property Grouping is not supported by this memo.


5.  Structured Property	Values
   Some	of the attributes defined by the [VCARD] specification consist of
   multiple components.	 Structured attribute values are also supported	by
   this	schema.	 The components	are separated by either	the "$"	or "#"
   character.


6.  Property Parameters
   The [VCARD] specification allows attribute values to	be qualified with
   "property parameters".  For example,	"home" and "office" telephone
   numbers can be distinguished	by the property	parameters "TYPE=HOME" and
   "TYPE=OFFICE" being applied to the respective home and office telephone
   number values.  Property parameters are supported using attribute
   description options,	as defined in [LDAPV3].


7.  Property Value Types
   The [VCARD] specification provides for the optional specification of	the
   attribute value data	type as	a property parameter.  The data	type of	all
   attributes defined by this schema are implicitly defined by their
   attribute type description.	The property value parameter type is not
   further supported by	this schema.

8.  Encoding Options
   The default encoding	or format for vCardObject attribute values is 8bit
   textual data.  The encoding may be overridden for an	individual property
   value by the	specification of an encoding option on the attribute
   description.	 These options allow for the return of the attribute value
   in a	format other than the default textual format.  These options may be
   specified only on the logo, photo and sound attributes defined by this
   schema.

   An encoding option is based on the following	ABNF:
	   Encodeoption	   = ["encoding-"] binaryencode	/ b64encode

	   Binaryencode	   = "binary"		   ;As defined by [LDAPV3]

	   b64encode	   = "base64"		   ;As defined by [RFC2045]


9.  Binary Encoding
   The "binary"	option is as described in [LDAPV3].


10.  Base-64 Encoding
   The "base64"	option overrides the default format for	attribute values so
   that	they are transferred as	7-bit text, thus making	it safe	to carry
   over	restricted transports.	[RFC2045] defines the encoding of this
   format.


11.  Language Option
   [NOTE - this	is old text - may just refer to	RFC2596]
   The language	used in	the vCardObject	attribute values may be	explicitly
   specified for an individual property	value by the specification of a
   language option on the attribute description.  The language is specified
   as a	string consistent with [RFC1766].  This	option may be specified	on
   any attribute defined by this schema.

   The language	option is based	on the following ABNF:

	   langoption	   = "language-" langtype

	   langtype	   = <A	language string	as defined in RFC 1766>

   For example,	"vcardNOTE;language=us-eng" for	a Comment attribute
   description whose textual value is written in US English.


12.  Image Format Option
   This	option specifies the image format for the photo	and logo attributes
   value.  The image format option MUST	be specified only on the photo and
   logo	attribute.  These attributes MUST specify this option in order to
   specify the graphic image format of the photo or logo value.

   The image format option is based on the following ABNF:


<TBD>				     4		   Expires January 2001
Internet Draft		     LDAP vCard	Schema		    August 22, 2000


	   imageoption	   = "format-" formattype

	   formattype	   = <Any AINA registered image	format subtype>

   For example,	"photo;format=jpeg" for	a Photo	attribute description for a
   value in a JPEG image format.


13.  Delivery Type Option
   This	option specifies the characteristics of	delivery address and
   delivery label attributes value.  The delivery type option may be
   specified only in the vcardADR or vcardLABEL	attributes.

   The delivery	address	type option is based on	the following ABNF:

	   deliveroption    = (["dom"]	    ;An	domestic delivery
			   / ["intl"])	   ;An international delivery
			     ["postal"]	   ;A postal delivery
			     ["parcel"]	   ;A parcel delivery
			     ["home"]	   ;A residential delivery
			     ["work"]	   ;A business delivery
			     ["pref"]	   ;A preferred	delivery

   For example,	"adr;dom;postal;parcel;home" for an attribute description
   for a domestic delivery address for a residence that	is used	for postal
   and parcel service delivery.


14.  Telephone Type Option
   This	option specifies the characteristics of	telephone number attribute
   value.  The telephone type option may be specified only in the vcardTEL
   attribute.

   The telephone type option is	based on the following ABNF:

	    teleoption = ["home"]      ;A residential number
			     ["work"]	   ;A business number
			     ["voice"]	   ;A voice number
			     ["fax"]	   ;A facsimile	number
			     ["msg"]	   ;A number with voice	mail
			    ( ["cell"]	   ;An analog cellular number
			    / ["pager"]	   ;A pager number
			    / ["pcs"]	   ;A digital PCS number
			    / ["bbs"]	   ;A bulletin board system number
			    / ["modem"]	   ;A number with a MODEM attached
			    / ["car"]	   ;A car cellular number
			    / ["isdn"]	   ;An ISDN SPID
			    / ["video"])   ;A video conferencing number
			      ["pref"]	   ;A preferred	number

   For example,	"tel;pref;work;voice;msg" for a	Telephone Number property
   which is preferred over other telephone numbers for work.  In addition,
   the telephone number	is a voice line	with voice mail	support.

15.  Electronic	Mail Type Option
   This	option specifies the characteristics of	electronic mail	attribute
   value.  The electronic mail type option may be specified only in the
   electronicMail attribute.

   The electronic mail type option is based on the following ABNF:

	   emailoption	     = (["internet"]  ;An internet email address
			     / ["x400"]	      ;A X.400 OR address
			     / ["video"]      ;A video conferencing number
			     / [word] )	      ;Any other email address type
			       ["pref"]	      ;A preferred number

	  word		    = 1*char	      ;A word

   For example,	"email;internet" for an	attribute description with a value
   that	is an Internet,	RFC822 address format.


16.  Sound Format Type Option
   This	option specifies the format of the sound attribute value.  The
   sound format	type option may	be specified only in the sound attribute.

   The sound format type option	is based on the	following ABNF:

	 soundoption	  = <Any AINA registered sound format subtype>

   For example,	"sound;basic" for a Sound attribute description	whose value
   is single channel audio encoded using 8bit ISDN mu-law [PCM]	at a sample
   rate	of 8000	Hz.


17.  Object Definitions
   The following object	classes	are defined by this schema.  LDAP servers
   should recognize the	object classes listed in this section as values	of
   the objectClass attribute.


17.1.  VCard Object
   The vCardObject is a	container for collecting together attributes
   describing a	person or resource.

24.  Security Attributes

24.1.
   The attribute specifies a public key	or authentication certificate
   associated with the vCardObject.  This attribute corresponds	to the
   [VCARD] "KEY" property.  If the value of the	attribute is a public key,
   then	the value is encoded in	the vCardString	syntax.	 If the	value of
   the attribute is a certificate, then	the binary option MUST be specified
   and the value is an octet-string.

	   (1.3.6.1.4.1.2309.1.1.1.1.24	NAME 'key'
		DESC 'key or certificate'
		EQUALITY caseIgnoreMatch SUBSTR	caseIgnoreSubstringMatch
		SYNTAX 'vCardString{255}' SINGLE-VALUE)


24.2.  Syntax Definitions
   The following syntax	descriptions are defined by this schema.  New
   syntax definitions were defined by this memo	in order to assure an
   unambiguous rendering of the	directory information in a syntax
   consistent with the [VCARD].	 Reuse of existing syntax definitions from
   either X.500	or other person	schemas	would not guarantee delivery of	the
   directory information in a syntax consistent	with [VCARD].  For example,
   the existing	date/time syntax is not	consistent with	ISO 8601 or the
   emerging Internet date/time specification.  The directory string syntax
   does	not convey the form of the multi-line label text.

   Servers should recognize all	the syntax definitions described in this
   memo.


24.3.  VCardString
   Values with the vCardString syntax are encoded in the [UTF8]	form.
   Servers and clients MUST be prepared	to receive encodings of	arbitrary
   Unicode characters.	Values with the	vCardString syntax are encoded
   according to	the following ABNF:

	     string		  = *char

	     char		  = <Any character in [UTF8]>

	     (1.3.6.1.4.1.2309.1.1.1.1.25 DESC 'vCardString')


24.4.  vcardNAMEtype
   Values with the vcardNAMEtype syntax	are encoded as if they were
   vCardString types.  The value is structured text consisting of the
   family name component, the given names component, the other names
   component, honorific	prefix components and honorific	suffix components.
   The value is	encoded	according to the following ABNF:


	      name	   = family delim given	[delim other [delim prefix

24.5.  vCardImage
   Values with the vCardImage syntax are encoded as graphical images in	the
   format specified by the image type option.  This can	be any IANA
   registered graphical	image format.  These binary data formats MUST
   either be passed as a binary	object using the binary	encoding option	or
   as packed binary text data when the base64 encoding option is specified.

	   (1.3.6.1.4.1.2309.1.1.1.1.27	DESC 'vCardImage')


24.6.  vCardDate
   Values with the vCardDate syntax are	encoded	as if they were	vCardString
   types.  The values are text representations of the calendar date as
   specified in	ISO 8601 and by	the following ABNF:

	   date	   = fulldate

	   digit   = <any [UTF8] decimal digit>	    ;0-9
	   date-fullyear    = 4digit
	   date-month  = 2digit		       ;01-12
	   date-mday   = 2digit		       ;01-28, 01-29, 01-30, 01-31
						   ;based on month/year
	   full-date   = date-fullyear date-month date-mday

   vCardString types.  The value is structured text consisting of the
   extended component, post office box component, street address component,
   locality component, region component, postal	code component and country
   component.  If the address option includes indicates	that the value is
   an international address, then the country component	MUST be	present.

24.9.  vCardMultiLineString
   Value with the vCardMultiLineString syntax are encoded as if	they were
   vCardString types.  The value may consist of	multiple lines of text as
   defined in [VCARD].	However, the multiple line values are specified	in
   this	syntax by the following	ABNF:

	     char	  = <Any character in [UTF8]>
	     space	  = 1*"	"
	     delim	  = "$"	/ "#"
	     linetext	  = 1*char *(space 1*char)

   vCardString types.  Telephone numbers are recommended to be in
   international form.

	     (1.3.6.1.4.1.2309.1.1.1.1.33 DESC 'vCardTelephone')


24.12.	vCardPosition
   Values with the vCardPosition syntax	are encoded as if they were
   vCardString types.  The value is structured text consisting of the
   floating point longitude global position followed by	the latitude global
   position and	by the following ABNF:

	      position	  = float delim	float

24.14.	vCardSound
   Values with the vCardSound syntax are encoded as digital audio in the
   format specified by the sound type option.  This can	be any IANA
   registered digital audio format.  This binary data MUST either be passed
   as a	binary object using the	binary encoding	option or as packed binary
   text	data when the base64 encoding option is	specified.

		(1.3.6.1.4.1.2309.1.1.1.1.36 DESC 'vCardSound')


25.  Matching Rule Definitions
   The vCardObject data	is primarily encoded as	textual	information.
   Therefore, only the following matching rules	from [LDAPSYN] are required
   by this schema.

	       caseIgnoreMatch
	       caseIgnoreSubstringMatch

   Servers should allow	all matching rules listed in this section to be
   used	in the extensibleMatch.	 In general, these servers should allow
   matching rules to be	used with all attribute	types known to the server,
   when	the assertion syntax of	the matching rule is the same at the value
   syntax of the attribute.

   Servers may implement additional matching rules.

   For all these rules,	the assertion syntax is	the same as the	value
   syntax.

   When	performing the caseIgnoreMatch and caseIgnoreSubstringMatch,
   multiple adjoining whitespace characters are	treated	the same, as an
   individual space, and leading and trailing whitespace is ignored.


26.  Example Usage
   The following is an example of LDAP URL query to get	the formatted name
   and work telephone number for anyone	in the USA named Smith.

   ldap:///c=US?vcardFN,vcardTEL;work??(vcardFN=Smith*)

   The following is an example of a vCardObject	using the LDIF format of
   [LDIF].

   dn:vcardFN =	John Smith
   objectClass:top
   objectClass:vCardObject
   vcardFN:John	Smith

27.  Security Considerations
   In addition to the security considerations specified	in [LDAPV3] the
   following considerations should be reviewed by implementors of this
   memo.


27.1.  Disclosure
   Attributes of directory entries are used to provide descriptive
   information about the real-word objects they	represent, which be people
   or resources.  Most countries have privacy laws regarding the
   publication of information about people.


27.2.  Security	Concerns
   The [VCARD] specification provides a	robust schema for representing
   information about people or resources.  Publication of this information
   in Internet directories providing LDAP support for this schema may
   provide an inadvertent means	for unauthorized use of	the information
   once	it has been retrieved.	Care should be taken in	managing both the
   access of directories containing personal data.

   In addition,	the flexible nature of the vCard format	may facilitate the
   spoofing of a person	or resource or other such fraudulent activities	by
   an untrusted	individual.  Care should be taken to authenticate the
   originator of any vCard based personal data.


28.  Acknowledgments:
   This	document is based on the [VCARD] specification.	 This work is
   heavily influenced by the early contributions of Roland Alden, Mike
   O'Brien, Gary Hand, Pat Megowan and others who helped draft the original
   specification.

   In addition,	the following have participated	in the review and
   discussion of this memo: Roland Alden, Harald Alvestrand, Mike Dugan,
   Alec	Dun, David Goodman, Bruce Greenblatt, Frode Hernes, Paul Hoffman,
   Tim Howes, Burton Lee, Chris	Newman,	Dave Mease, Vinod Seraphin, Richard
   Shusterman, and Mark	Wahl.
