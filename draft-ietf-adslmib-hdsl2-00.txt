1.  Abstract

   This document defines an experimental portion of the Management
   Information Base (MIB) MIB module for use with network management
   protocols in the Internet community.  In particular, it describes
   objects used for managing HDSL2 and SHDSL interfaces.

   This document specifies a MIB module in a manner that is both
   compliant to the SNMPv2 SMI, and semantically identical to the peer
   SNMPv1 definitions.

2.  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        STD 16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4].
        The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC
        2578 [5], STD 58, RFC 2579 [6] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [7].

    o   Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].  A second version of the SNMP
        message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
        protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and
        RFC 1906 [10].  The third version of the message protocol is

INTERNET-DRAFT               HDSL2-LINE MIB                     May 2000

        called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and
        RFC 2574 [12].

    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].  A second set of protocol
        operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
        [13].

    o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14]
        and the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC
        2575 [15].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [16].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [17].

2.1.  Object Definitions

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB. Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
   defined in the SMI. In particular, each object type is named by an
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name. The object
   type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a
   specific instantiation of the object. For human convenience, we
   often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to also refer to
   the object type.

3.  Introduction

   This document describes an SNMP HDSL2 Line MIB which is intended to
   work with both the SNMPv1 and the SNMPv2.  The MIB, however, is based
   on SNMPv2 Structure of Management Information [18] and SNMPv2 Textual
   Conventions [19].  This does not, however, mean that either the Agent

   or Manager must be SNMPv2 protocol compliant.  All MIB definitions
   are backward compatible for SNMPv1 implementation.

   The MIB definitions are attached.  These definitions are based upon
   the specification for the HDSL2 and SHDSL Embedded Operations Channel
   (EOC) as defined in ANSI T1E1.4/2000-006 [20] and ITU G.991.2 (ex
   G.SHDSL) [21].  The MIB will eventually be located in the MIB tree
   under MIB 2 transmission, as discussed in the MIB-2 Integration (RFC
   1213 [22] and RFC 2233 [23]) section of this document.  Until
   approved by the IETF, vendors may also choose to support it under
   their own enterprise IDs.

   hdsl2LineMIB MODULE-IDENTITY ::= { VendorEnterpriseID nnn }

3.1.  Relationship of the HDSL2 Line MIB with Standard MIBs

   This section outlines the relationship of this MIB with other MIBs
   described in RFCs and in various degrees of "standardization".
   Specifically, MIB-2 as presented in RFC 1213 [22] and RFC 2233 [23]
   is discussed.

3.1.1  General MIB-2 Integration (RFCs 1213 and 2233)

   The HDSL2 Line MIB specifies the detailed attributes of a data
   interface.  As such, it needs to integrate with RFC 2233 [23]. The
   IANA has assigned the following ifTypes to HDSL2 and SHDSL:

       IANAifType ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
       ...
       SYNTAX INTEGER {
       ...
          hdsl2 (168), -- High Bit-Rate DSL, 2nd generation
          shdsl (169), -- Multirate HDSL2
       ...
       }

   Therefore, pending approval of the IETF, RFC 2233 [23] mandates that
   this MIB will be accessed through one of the two following
   mib-2.transmission.ifTypes as shown:

       hdsl2Interface  ::= { transmission 168 }
       shdslInterface ::= { transmission 169 }

3.1.2  Usage of ifTable

   The MIB branch identified by this ifType contains tables appropriate
   for this interface type.  Most such tables extend the ifEntry table,
   and are indexed by ifIndex.

   The following attributes are part of the mandatory ifGeneral group in
   RFC 2233 [23], and are not duplicated in the HDSL2 Line MIB.

4.2.  Structure

   The MIB has tables for:

   o HU inventory

   o line topology

   o HU performance

   - Current and up to 96 buckets of 15 min performance history

   - Current and Previous 1 Day bucket performance history

   o HTU DS1 performance

   - Current and up to 96 buckets of 15 min performance history

   - Current and Previous 1 Day bucket performance history

   o profiles - configuration and alarm parameters

   o maintenance - test configuration and control parameters

4.2.1  Line Topology

   An HDSL2 Line consists of a minimum of two HDSL2 modems.  These
   modems are the HTU-C, for central site terminal unit, and HTU-R,
   for remote site terminal unit.  Further, between these two units
   are from one to eight optional regenerators, called HRUs.  Each
   HRU contains two HDSL2 modems, one on the network side which
   communicates "upstream" towards the HTU-C, and one on the customer
   side which communicates "downstream" towards the HTU-R.

   For the purposes of this MIB, each HDSL2 modem, whether resident
   in an HTU or HRU, is considered an "endpoint".  Connection between
   two endpoints (HTU to HRU, HRU to HRU, HTU to HTU) is considered a
   "segment".

   The relationship between physical equipment inventory and the
   segments is accomplished through the use of three tables:

   o hdsl2InventoryTable, which contains equipment inventory
     information

   o hdsl2EndpointTable, which identifies each endpoint and contains
     performance data

   o hdsl2SegmentTable, which identifies the pairs of endpoints
     that comprise the Line.

   SHDSL supports both 2 and 4 wire implementations.  To support
   4-wire implementations, each wire pair is considered a separate
   segment.  For example, consider the following HDSL2 line:

                +-------+   +-----+   +-------+
                | HTU-C +---+ HRU +---+ HTU-R |
                +-------+   +-----+   +-------+

                   Figure 2: Sample HDSL2 line

   The following table entries would represent this line:

        Inventory    Endpoints       Segments
        ---------    ------------    --------
        1 (HTU-C)    1  (HTU-C)      1,2
        2 (HRU)      2  (HRU-N)      3,4
        3 (HTU-R)    3  (HRU-C)
                     4  (HTU-R)

              Figure 3: Sample HDSL2 line topology

   For a 4-wire SHDSL Line, the following table entries would
   represent the line:

        Inventory    Endpoint        Segments
        Index        Index           Index/Pair
        ---------    ------------    --------
        1 (HTU-C)    1  (HTU-C)      1    1,2
        2 (HRU)      2  (HRU-N)      2    1,2
        3 (HTU-R)    3  (HRU-C)      3    3,4
                     4  (HTU-R)      4    3,4

           Figure 4: Sample 4-wire SHDSL line topology

4.3.  Counters, Interval Buckets and Thresholds

   For SNR Margin, Loop Attenuation, ES, SES, CRC anomalies, LOSWS, and
   UAS, there are event counters, current 15-minute and one (up to 96)
   15-minute history bucket(s) of "interval-counters", as well as
   current and previous 1-day interval-counters. Each current 15-minute
   event bucket has an associated threshold trap.  The buckets are
   defined using the textual conventions of RFC 2493 [24].

   For HDSL2 implementations which support DS1 interfaces on the HTUs,
   there are similar counters, buckets, and thresholds for DS1 ES,
   DS1 SES, DS1 CV-L, and DS1 LOSS.

   Unlike RFC 2493 [24] and RFC 2662 [25], there is no representation
   in the MIB for invalid buckets.  In those cases where the data for
   an interval is suspect or known to be invalid, the agent should
   not report the interval.

INTERNET-DRAFT               HDSL2-LINE MIB                     May 2000

   There is no requirement for an agent to ensure a fixed relationship
   between the start of a fifteen minute and any wall clock; however
   some implementations may align the fifteen minute intervals with
   quarter hours. Likewise, an implementation may choose to align one
   day intervals with the start of a day.

   Counters are not reset when an HU is reinitialized, only when the
   agent is reset or reinitialized (or under specific request outside
   the scope of this MIB).

4.4.  Profiles

   As a managed node can handle a large number of HUs, (e.g., hundreds
   or perhaps thousands of HDSL2 lines), provisioning every parameter
   on every HU may become burdensome. In response, four MIB tables have
   been created to define HDSL2 equipment configuration data profiles,
   as well as a mechanism to associate the equipment to these profiles.

   The four tables are:

   o   hdsl2EndpointAlarmConfProfileTable, used for configuring
       alarm thresholds for each endpoint.

   o   hdsl2DS1ProfileTable, used for configuring DS1-specific
       interfaces.  This group is optional for SDHSL interfaces.

   o   hdsl2DS1AlarmConfProfileTable, used for configuring DS1-specific
       alarm thresholds.  This group is optional for SHDSL interfaces.

   o   hdsl2ShdslProfileTable, used for configuring SHDSL lines.
       This group is optional for HDSL2 interfaces.

   Implementations will enable the manager to dynamically create and
   delete profiles as needed. The index of each profile is a locally-
   unique administratively assigned name for the profile having the
   textual convention `SnmpAdminString' (RFC 2571 [26]).

   One or more HDSL2 lines may be configured to share parameters of a
   single profile (e.g., hdsl2EndpointAlarmConfProfile = `silver') by
   setting its hdsl2EndpointAlarmConfProfile objects to the value of
   this profile. If a change is made to the profile, all lines that refer
   to it will be reconfigured to the changed parameters. Before a profile
   can be deleted or taken out of service it must be first unreferenced
   from all associated lines.

   Implementations must provide a default profile whose name is `DEFVAL'
   for each profile type.  The values of the associated parameters will
   be vendor specific unless otherwise indicated in this document. Before
   a line's profiles have been set, these profiles will be automatically
   used by setting hdsl2EndpointAlarmConfProfile, hdsl2ShdslProfile,
   hdsl2DS1ConfProfile, and hdsl2DS1AlarmConfProfile to `DEFVAL' where
   appropriate.

INTERNET-DRAFT               HDSL2-LINE MIB                     May 2000

   Profiles are created, assigned, and deleted dynamically using the
   profile name and profile row status in each of the four tables.

4.5.  Traps

   The ability to generate the SNMP traps coldStart/WarmStart (per [23])
   which are per agent (e.g., per DSLAM in such a device), and linkUp /
   linkDown (per [23]) -- which are per interface (i.e., HDSL2 line)
   is required.

   A linkDown trap may be generated whenever any of ES, SES, CRC Anomaly,
   LOSWS, or UAS event occurs.  At this operational point, a manager
   can use hdsl2EndpointCurrStatus for additional detailed information. The
   corresponding linkUp trap may be sent when all link failure conditions
   are cleared.

   The traps defined in this MIB are for initialization failure and for
   the threshold crossings associated with the following events: ES,
   SES, CRC Anomaly, LOSWS, UAS, DS1 ES, DS1 SES, DS1 CVL, and DS1 LOSS.
   Each threshold has its own enable/threshold value. When that value is
   0, the trap is disabled.

   The current status object, hdsl2EndpointCurrStatus, indicates, through
   a bitmask, all outstanding error conditions or that the line is
   operational. Note that this object claims to represent the status of
   a particular HDSL2 interface. However, since the SNMP agent likely
   co-resides with only one end of the line such as a HTU-C, the
   status object for interfaces 'down the line' (such as HRUs and the
   HTU-R) may be incomplete. For example, when there are errors on the
   line, the far-end HTU may not be able to correctly report this
   condition. Therefore, not all conditions are included in its current
   status.

   A threshold trap occurs whenever the corresponding current 15-minute
   interval error counter becomes equal and/or exceeds to the threshold
   value. One trap may be sent per interval per interface. Since the
   current 15-minute counter are reset to 0 every 15 minutes, if the
   condition persists, the trap may recur as often as every 15 minutes.
   For example, to get a trap whenever a "loss of" event occurs (but at
   most once every 15 minutes), set the corresponding threshold to 1.
   The agent will generate a trap when the event originally occurs.

   Note that the NMS may receive a linkDown trap, as well, if enabled.
   At the beginning of the next 15 minute interval, the counter is reset.
   When the first second goes by and the event occurs, the current
   interval bucket will be 1, which equals the threshold and the trap
   will be sent again.

5.  Conformance and Compliance

   The MIB is organized to cover all elements of an HDSL2 line.  In
   addition, objects have been added to provide support for SHDSL lines.

        "The MIB module defining objects for the management
        of a series of HDSL2 modems on a HDSL2 line.  An
        agent may reside at either end of the HDSL2 line,
        however the MIB is designed to require no management
        communication between the modems beyond that
        inherent in the low-level HDSL2 EOC line protocol
        as defined in ANSI T1E1.4/2000-006.  The agent may
        monitor and control this protocol for its needs."
