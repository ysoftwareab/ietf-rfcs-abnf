<h1><br />Requirements for SIP-based Media Recording (SIPREC)<br />draft-ietf-siprec-req-06</h1>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>Session recording is a critical requirement in many business
   	communications environments such as call centers and financial
   	trading floors.  In some of these environments, all calls must be
	recorded for regulatory and compliance reasons.  In others, calls may
   	be recorded for quality control or business analytics.
</p>
<p>Recording is typically done by sending a copy of the session media 
   	to the recording devices.  This document specifies requirements for 
   	extensions to SIP that will manage delivery of RTP media from an end-point 
   	that originates media (or that has access to it) to a recording device.  
   	This is being referred to as SIP-based Media Recording.

Introduction</h3>

<p>Session recording is a critical operational requirement in many
    	businesses, especially where voice is used as a medium for commerce
    	and customer support.  A prime example where voice is used for trade
    	is the financial industry.  The call recording requirements in this
    	industry are quite stringent.  The recorded calls are used for
    	dispute resolution and compliance.  Other businesses such as customer
    	support call centers typically employ call recording for quality
    	control or business analytics, with different requirements.
</p>
<p>Depending on the country and its regulatory requirements, financial
    	trading floors typically must record all calls.  In contrast, call centers typically only
    	record a subset of the calls, and calls must not fail regardless of
    	the availability of the recording device.
</p>
<p>Respecting the privacy rights and wishes of users engaged in a call
    	is of paramount importance. In many jurisdictions participants have a right to 
        know that the session is being recorded or might be recorded, and have a 
        right to opt out, either by terminating the call or by demanding that the 
        call not be recorded. Therefore this document contains requirements for being 
       able to notify users that a call is being recorded and for users to be able 
       to request that a call not be recorded.
       
       Use cases where users participating in a call are not informed that the 
       call is or might be recorded are outside the scope of this document. 
       In particular, lawful intercept is outside the scope of this document.
    	
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the scale and cost burdens vary widely, in all markets,
   	where the different needs for solution capabilities such as media
   	injection, transcoding, and security-related needs do not conform
   	well to a one-size-fits-all model.  If a standardized solution
   	supports all of the requirements from every recording market, but
   	doing so would be expensive for markets with lesser needs, then
   	proprietary solutions for those markets will continue to propagate.
   	Care must be taken, therefore, to make a standards-based solution
   	support optionality and flexibility.
</p>
<p>This document specifies requirements for using SIP <a class='info' href='#RFC3261'>[RFC3261]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., Schulzrinne, H., Camarillo, G., Johnston, A., Peterson, J., Sparks, R., Handley, M., and E. Schooler, &ldquo;SIP: Session Initiation Protocol,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> between a 
   	Session Recording Client and a Session Recording Server to control the 
   	recording of media that has been transmitted in the context of a Communication Session.
   	
  	A Communication Session is the "call" between participants. 
  	The Session Recording Client is the source of the recorded media. The Session Recording Server is the sink of
   	recorded media. It should be noted that the requirements for the protocol between a
   	Session Recording Server and Session Recording Client have very similar requirements
   	(such as codec and transport negotiation, encryption key interchange,
   	firewall traversal) as compared to regular SIP media sessions.  The
   	choice of SIP for session recording provides reuse of an existing
   	protocol.  
</p>
<p>The recorded sessions can be any RTP media sessions 
   	including voice, DTMF (as defined by [RFC4733]), video, and text (as defined by [RFC4103]).
</p>
<p>An archived session recording is typically comprised of the Communication Session media content and 
   	the Communication Session Metadata.  The Communication Session Metadata allows recording archives to be searched and
   	filtered at a later time and allows a session to be played back in a meaningful way, 
   	e.g., with correct synchronization between the media. 
   	
   	The Communication Session Metadata needs to be conveyed from the Session Recording Client 
   	to the Session Recording Server.
</p>
<p>This document only considers active recording, where the Session Recording
   	Client purposefully streams media to a Session Recording Server.  Passive
   	recording, where a recording device detects media directly from the
	network, is outside the scope of this document.

Definitions</h3>

<p>Session Recording Server (SRS): A Session Recording Server (SRS) is a SIP User Agent (UA) that is a 
	specialized media server or collector that acts as the sink of the recorded media.  An
	SRS is a logical function that typically archives media for extended durations of time and
	provides interfaces for search and retrieval of the archived media.
	An SRS is typically implemented as a multi-port device that is capable
	of receiving media from several sources simultaneously.  An SRS is
	typically also the sink of the recorded session metadata.  
	
</p>
<p>Session Recording Client (SRC): A Session Recording Client (SRC) is a SIP User Agent
	(UA) that acts as the source of the recorded media, sending it to the SRS.  An SRC is a logical
	function.  Its capabilities may be implemented across one or more
	physical devices.  In practice, an SRC could be a personal device
	(such as a SIP phone), a SIP Media Gateway (MG), a Session Border
	Controller (SBC) or a SIP Media Server (MS) integrated with an
	Application Server (AS).  This specification defines the term SRC such
	that all such SIP entities can be generically addressed under one
	definition.  The SRC itself or another entity working on its behalf
	(such as a SIP Application Server) may act as the source of the
	recording metadata.
</p>
<p>Communication Session (CS): A session created between two or more SIP User Agents (UAs) 
	that is the target for recording.
</p>
<p>Recording Session (RS): The SIP session created between an SRC and SRS for the
   	purpose of recording a Communication Session.
</p>
<p>Figure 1 pictorially represents the relationship between a Recording Session and Communication Session.

    	Applications include enterprise, contact center, and financial trading floors.

<p>Also commonly known as Total Recording.
</p>
<p>Use Case 2: Selective Recording: Start a Recording Session when a 
    	Communication Session to be recorded is established.
</p><br /><hr class="insert" />
<a name="selective"></a>

<p>In this example, Communication Sessions 1 and 3 are recorded but CS 2 is not.
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
CS  |--- CS 1 ---|      |--- CS 2 ---|     |--- CS 3 ---|

RS  |--- RS 1----|                         |--- RS 2 ---|
</pre></div>
<p>
</p><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="2" align="center"><tr><td align="center"><font face="monaco, MS Sans Serif" size="1"><b>&nbsp;Figure&nbsp;3&nbsp;</b></font><br /></td></tr></table><hr class="insert" />

<p>Use Case 3:  Dynamic Recording:  Start/Stop a Recording Session during a Communication Session.
</p>
<p>The Recording Session starts during a Communication Session, either manually via a user-controlled mechanism 
    	(e.g. button on user&rsquo;s phone) or automatically via an application (e.g. a Contact Center customer service application) 
    	or business event. 
    	A Recording Session either ends during the Communication Session, or when the Communication Session ends.
</p><br /><hr class="insert" />
<a name="dynamic"></a>

<p>One or more Recording Sessions per Communication Session:
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
CS  |------------- Communication Session -----------|

RS           |---- RS 1 ----|  |---- RS 2 -----|
</pre></div>
<p>
</p><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="2" align="center"><tr><td align="center"><font face="monaco, MS Sans Serif" size="1"><b>&nbsp;Figure&nbsp;4&nbsp;</b></font><br /></td></tr></table><hr class="insert" />

<p>Also known as Mid-session or Mid-call Recording.
</p>
<p>Use Case 4: Persistent Recording: A single Recording Session captures one or more Communication Sessions, 
   	in sequence (Fig. 6) or in parallel (Fig. 7).   	
   	
</p><br /><hr class="insert" />
<a name="persistent"></a>

<p>
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
	  |--- CS 1 ---|      |--- CS 2 ---|     |--- CS 3 ---|

RS  |---------------------- Recording Session ---------------------|
</pre></div>
<p>
</p><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="2" align="center"><tr><td align="center"><font face="monaco, MS Sans Serif" size="1"><b>&nbsp;Figure&nbsp;5&nbsp;</b></font><br /></td></tr></table><hr class="insert" />

<p>A Recording Session records continuously without interruption.  
	
	Silent periods must be reproduced upon playback 
	(e.g. by recording the silent period, by not recording the silent periods 
	but marking them as metadata for a player to utilize, etc.)
	
	Applications include financial trading desks and emergency (first-responder) service
	bureaus. The length of a Persistent Recording Sessions is
	independent from the length of the actual Communication Sessions.
	Persistent Recording Sessions avoid issues such as media clipping
	that can occur due to delays in Recording Session establishment.
</p>
<p>The connection and attributes of media in the Recording
   	Session are not dynamically signaled for each Communication Session before
   	it can be recorded; however, codec re-negotiation is possible.
   	
   	CS details and CS metadata will still be
   	signaled, and can be correlated to the recorded media.  There
   	will still need to be a means of correlating the recorded media
   	connection/packets to the Communication Session.
</p><br /><hr class="insert" />
<a name="mixing"></a>

<p>In some cases, more than one concurrent Communication Session 
		(on a single end-user apparatus, e.g. trading floor turret) 
		is mixed into one Recording Session:
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
              |-------- CS 1 -------|
	         |-------- CS 2 -------|
	    |-------- CS 3 -------|

RS  |----------- Recording Session --------------|
</pre></div>
<p>
</p><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="2" align="center"><tr><td align="center"><font face="monaco, MS Sans Serif" size="1"><b>&nbsp;Figure&nbsp;6&nbsp;</b></font><br /></td></tr></table><hr class="insert" />

<p>Use Case 5: Real-time Recording Controls.
</p>
<p>For an active Recording Session, privacy or security reasons may
   	demand not capturing a specific portion of a conversation.  An
   	example is for PCI (payment card industry) compliance where credit
	card info must be protected.  One solution is to not record a caller
   	speaking their credit card information.
</p>
<p>An example of a real-time controls is Pause/Resume.
</p>
<p>Use Case 6: IVR / Voice Portal Recording.
</p>
<p>   Self-service Interactive Voice Response (DTMF or ASR) applications
   	may need to be recorded for application performance tuning or to meet
   	compliance requirements.
</p>
<p>Metadata about an IVR session recording must include session information 
   	and may include application context information (e.g. VoiceXML session variables, dialog names, etc.)
</p>
<p>Use Case 7: Enterprise Mobility Recording.
</p>
<p>Many agents and enterprise workers are not located on company premises.
</p>
<p>Examples:
</p>
<p>o Home-based agents or enterprise workers.
</p>
<p>o Mobile phones of knowledge workers when they conduct work related
   	(and legally required recording) calls. i.e. insurance agents,
   	brokers, physicians.
</p>
<p>Use Case 8: Geographically distributed or centralized recording.
</p>
<p>Global banks with multiple branches up to thousands of small sites.
</p>
<p>o Only phones and network infrastructure in branches, no recording
   	services.
</p>
<p>o Internal calls inside or between branches must be recorded.
</p>
<p>o Centralized recording system in data centers together with
   	telephony infrastructure (e.g. PBX).
</p>
<p>Use Case 9: Record complex call scenarios.
</p>
<p>Record a call that is associated with another call.
</p>
<p>Example:
</p>
<p>o Customer in conversation with Agent
</p>
<p>o Agent puts customer on hold in order to consult with a Supervisor.
</p>
<p>o Agent in conversation with Supervisor.
</p>
<p>o Agent disconnects from Supervisor, reconnects with Customer.
</p>
<p>o The Supervisor call must be associated with the original customer call.
</p>
<p>Use case 10: High availability and continuous recording.
</p>
<p>Specific deployment scenarios present different requirements for system availability, 
   	error handling, etc. including:
</p>
<p>o An SRS must always be available at call setup time.
</p>
<p>o No loss of media recording, including during failure of an SRS.
</p>
<p>o The Communication Session must be terminated (or suitable notification) 
   	in the event of a recording failure.
</p>
<p>Use Case 11: Record multi-channel, multi-media session.
</p>
<p>Some applications require the recording of more than one media
	stream, possibly of different types.  Media is synchronized, either
	at storage or at playback.
</p>
<p>Speech analytics technologies (e.g. word spotting, emotion detection,
	speaker identification) may require speaker-separated recordings for
	optimum performance.
</p>
<p>Multi-modal Contact Centers may include audio, video, IM or other
	interaction modalities.
</p>
<p>In trading floors environments, in order to save resources, 
	it may be preferable to mix multiple concurrent calls (Communication Sessions) 
	on different handsets/speakers on the same turret into single recording session.
</p>
<p>Use Case 12: Real-time media processing.
</p>
<p>Recorder must support real-time media processing, such as speech analytics.
</p>
<p>Recording and real-time analytics of trading floor interactions
	(including video and instant messaging).  Real time analytics is
	required for automatic intervention (stopping interaction or alert)
	if for example, trader is not following regulations.
</p>
<p>Speaker separation is required in order to reliably detect who is
	saying specific phrases.

       	play a message at the beginning of a session, a visual indicator on a display, etc.
</p>
<p>o REQ-019 The  mechanism MUST provide a way for metadata to be conveyed to the SRS incrementally during the CS.
</p>

<a name="rfc.section.6"></a><h3>6.&nbsp;
Privacy Considerations</h3>

<p>Respecting the privacy rights and wishes of users engaged in a call
    	is of paramount importance. In many jurisdictions participants have a right to 
        know that the session is being recorded or might be recorded, and have a 
        right to opt out, either by terminating the call or by demanding that the 
        call not be recorded. Therefore this document contains requirements for being 
       able to notify users that a call is being recorded and for users to be able 
       to request that a call not be recorded.
       
       Use cases where users participating in a call are not informed that the 
       call is or might be recorded are outside the scope of this document. 
       In particular, lawful intercept is outside the scope of this document.
</p>
<p>
       Requirements for participant notification of recording 
       varies widely by jurisdiction. In a given deployment, not all users will be 
       authorized to stop the recording 
	of a CS (although any user can terminate a CS). Typically users within the 
	domain that is carrying out the recording will be subject to policies of 
	that domain concerning whether CSs are recorded. For example, in a call centre, 
	agents will be subject to policies of the call centre and may or may not have 
	the right to prevent the recording of a CS or part of a CS. Users calling into 
	the call centre, on the other hand, will typically have to ask the agent not 
	to record the CS. If the agent is unable to prevent recording, or if caller 
	does not trust the agent, the only option generally is to terminate the CS.
</p>
<p>Privacy considerations also extend to what happens to a recording once it 
	has been created. Typical issues are who can access the recording (e.g., 
	receive a copy of the recording, view the metadata, play back the media, etc.), 
	for what purpose can the recording be used (e.g., for non-repudiation, for 
	training purposes, for quality control purposes, etc.) and for how long the 
	recording is to be retained before deletion. These are typically policies of 
	the domain that makes the recording, rather than policies of individual users 
	involved in a recorded CS, whether those users be in the same domain or in a 
	different domain. Taking the call centre example again, agents might be made 
	aware of call centre policy regarding retention and use of recordings as part 
	of their employment contract, and callers from outside the call centre might 
	be given some information about policy when notified that a CS will be recorded 
	(e.g., through an announcement that says that calls may be recorded  for quality purposes).
</p>
<p>This document does not specify any requirements for a user engaged in
	a CS to be able to dictate policy for what happens to a recording, or
	for such information to be conveyed from an SRC to an SRS. It is
	assumed that the SRS has access to policy applicable to its
	environment and can ensure that recordings are stored and used in
	accordance with that policy.

Security Considerations</h3>

<p>Session recording has substantial security implications, for the
       SIP UA's being recorded, the SRC, and the SRS.
</p>
<p>For the SIP UA's involved in the Communication Session, the requirements
       in this draft enable the UA to identify that a Communication Session is being
       recorded and for the UA to request that a given Communication Session is not
       subject to recording.
</p>
<p>Since humans don't typically look at or know about protocol signaling
       such as SIP, and indeed the SIP session might have originated through
       a PSTN Gateway without any ability to pass on in-signaling
       indications of recording, users can be notified of recording in the
       media itself through voice announcements, a visual indicator on
       the endpoint, or other means.
</p>
<p>With regards to security implications of the protocol(s), clearly
       there is a need for authentication, authorization, eavesdropping
       protection, and non-repudiation for the solution.  The SRC needs to
       know the SRS it is communicating with is legitimate, and vice-versa,
       even if they are in different domains.  Both the signaling and media
       for the Recording Session need the ability to be authenticated and protected from
       eavesdropping and non-repudiation.  Requirements are
       detailed in the requirements section.
