Internet-Draft               ICP Transition                 October 2009


1.  Introduction

   The exhaustion of IPv4 addresses is coming, while due to many
   reasons, no significant IPv6 deployment has occured.  The transition
   of users, networks and services from IPv4 to IPv6 is not so smoothly
   and expeditiously as expected.  The solutions now available are not
   sufficient for all the scenarios, so the IPv6 deployment models are
   revisited, and some new methods used for transition have been
   developed to complement the existing ones.  This document discusses
   the transition of services and the use of these new mechanisms from
   the ISP's point of view to provide approaches to the transition for
   ICPs.

   The transition of services to IPv6 will get started in succession
   from now or sooner in the future.  As we all know, the IPv4 users or
   various Requests to IPv4 services dominate in current networks, and
   even in the future the co-existence of IPv4 and IPv6 will persist for
   a long time. so how to preserve the continuity and availability of
   legacy services while migrating to IPv6 concerns ICPs deeply.  Since
   ICPs have different requirements of service level agreement, some
   care mostly about the stability and User Experience, and some care
   about the cost of migration mostly, the ISP should choose different
   migration solutions for ICPs to meet their needs and help them
   migrating to IPv6 rapidly.  Some recommendations on how to do it are
   given in this document.

   Approaches

   Dual Stack

   In order to provide full functional services for both IPv4 and IPv6,
   Dual stack may be a good choice.  It has less limitations and is
   suitable for ICPs that require high availability.  While it may be
   not cost efficient compared to the utilization of the IPv6 stack
   especially at the early stage of transition, so may be not acceptable
   to all.

   NAT64

   There must be some conservative ICPs that are sensitive to the cost
   and possible interruption caused by the migration.  They want to make
   experimental provision of IPv6 services firstly based on current
   infrastructures with no change or the system platforms that are not
   upgradable.  In this case, one could use some translation mechanism
   for the communication initiated from IPv6 Internet.

   IVI

Internet-Draft               ICP Transition                 October 2009


   On the other hand, there are some radical ICPs relatively that wish
   to migrate to IPv6 purely without IPv4 stack enabled, or maybe at
   later stage more IPv6-only servers are put in the network, while
   under the pressure of large quantity of IPv4 users, the reachability
   for them needs to be preserved.  IVI is fit for this case.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Dual Stack

   As specified in RFC4213, Dual Stack is the most well understood and
   recommended approach today providing complete implementations for
   both IPv4 and IPv6.  Through Dual Stack routing infrastructure, the
   Dual Stack servers could interoperate with IPv4 and IPv6 user devices
   respectively using IPv4 and IPv6.  Of course, both stack and
   application capabilities of IPv4 and IPv6 must be enabled on the
   "Dual Stack servers".  For the application aspects of transition,
   please refer to RFC4038.

2.1.  Operational Issues

   For Dual stack mechanism, more issues may come from the business
   aspect rather than techniques, which are about how to better align
   the costs and benefits of the migration.  We only discuss the
   technical issues of all these approaches here.

   The migration can not be done in one day, the issues of adding DNS
   records should be considered in cases where some services are more
   IPv6-ready than others.

   MORE, TBD..

2.2.  Requests to ICPs

   The system software of the servers should be upgradable, and the
   hardware may need to be upgraded to support both IPv4 and IPv6
   capabilities, as more resources like memery are needed to run two
   sets of stacks and applications concurrently.

   Further more, based on new API, some service applications may need to

   be redeveloped, see RFC3493 and RFC3542 about the API for IPv6.


3.  NAT64

   NAT64 defines a stateful translation mechanism used for communication
   between IPv4 and IPv6 nodes, the suitable scenarios include "an IPv6
   network to the IPv4 Internet" and "the IPv6 Internet to an IPv4
   network", implying that the communication should be iniciated from
   the IPv6 side.  The latter scenario applies to the case here.

3.1.  Operational Issues

   At least on IPv4 address pool used for translation should be
   configured on the GW and the capacity is limited by the size of the
   pool which is for the whole IPv6 Internet.  Then one has to determine
   where and how to deploy the DNS64 server which is used for
   synthesizing AAAA records from A records using special IPv6 prefix.
   Moreover, all the limitations of translators apply here.

   MORE, TBD..

3.2.  Requests to ICPs

   Nearly no changes are required in the servers, while there will be
   information lost during the translation, so necessary functional
   tests may be needed before the migration and deployment of some
   services in this way.


4.  IVI

   IVI is a stateless translation mechanism, the nodes are configured
   with IVI format IPv6 addresses which are formed by embedding IPv4
   addresses in IPv6 prefixes.  They appear as normal IPv6 nodes in the
   IPv6 network.  Meantime, the IVI nodes are connected to the legacy
   IPv4 Internet by IVI boxes which appear as normal IPv4 routers or
   gateways.  So the communications with IPv6 nodes could be achieved
   directly, and the communications with IPv4 Internet could be achieved
   via the stateless translator, IVI.

4.1.  Operational Issues

   One should better use the servers' original IPv4 addresses to form
   the IVI format IPv6 addresses, that will maintain the stability of
   the legacy IPv4 routing infrastructure.  The part of network where
   the IVI nodes are located should be designed accordingly.

4.2.  Requests to ICPs

   TBD.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document includes no request to IANA.


6.  Security Considerations

   WILL BE ADDED IN THE NEXT VERSION..
