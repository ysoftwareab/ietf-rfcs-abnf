1.0 INTRODUCTION

   This specification defines the addressing architecture of the IP
   Version 6 protocol.  It includes the basic formats for the various
   types of IPv6 addresses (unicast, anycast, and multicast).

2.0 IPv6 ADDRESSING

   IPv6 addresses are 128-bit identifiers for interfaces and sets of
   interfaces (where "interface" is as defined in Section 2 of [IPV6]).
   There are three types of addresses:


    Unicast:   An identifier for a single interface.  A packet sent to a
               unicast address is delivered to the interface identified
               by that address.

    Anycast:   An identifier for a set of interfaces (typically
               belonging to different nodes).  A packet sent to an
               anycast address is delivered to one of the interfaces
               identified by that address (the "nearest" one, according
               to the routing protocols' measure of distance).

    Multicast: An identifier for a set of interfaces (typically
               belonging to different nodes).  A packet sent to a
               multicast address is delivered to all interfaces
               identified by that address.

   There are no broadcast addresses in IPv6, their function being
   superseded by multicast addresses.

   In this document, fields in addresses are given a specific name, for
   example "subnet".  When this name is used with the term "ID" for
   identifier after the name (e.g., "subnet ID"), it refers to the
   contents of the named field.  When it is used with the term "prefix"
   (e.g., "subnet prefix") it refers to all of the address from the left
   up to and including this field.

   In IPv6, all zeros and all ones are legal values for any field,



draft-ietf-ipv6-addr-arch-v4-04.txt                             [Page 3]

INTERNET-DRAFT        IPv6 Addressing Architecture              May 2005


   unless specifically excluded.  Specifically, prefixes may contain, or
   end with, zero-valued fields.


2.1 Addressing Model

   IPv6 addresses of all types are assigned to interfaces, not nodes.
   An IPv6 unicast address refers to a single interface.  Since each
   interface belongs to a single node, any of that node's interfaces'
   unicast addresses may be used as an identifier for the node.

   All interfaces are required to have at least one link-local unicast
   address (see Section 2.8 for additional required addresses).  A
   single interface may also have multiple IPv6 addresses of any type
   (unicast, anycast, and multicast) or scope.  Unicast addresses with
   scope greater than link-scope are not needed for interfaces that are
   not used as the origin or destination of any IPv6 packets to or from
   non-neighbors.  This is sometimes convenient for point-to-point
   interfaces.  There is one exception to this addressing model:

      A unicast address or a set of unicast addresses may be assigned to
      multiple physical interfaces if the implementation treats the
      multiple physical interfaces as one interface when presenting it
      to the internet layer.  This is useful for load-sharing over
      multiple physical interfaces.

   Currently IPv6 continues the IPv4 model that a subnet prefix is
   associated with one link.  Multiple subnet prefixes may be assigned
   to the same link.


2.2 Text Representation of Addresses

   There are three conventional forms for representing IPv6 addresses as
   text strings:

   1. The preferred form is x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x, where the 'x's are one to
      four hexadecimal digits of the eight 16-bit pieces of the address.
      Examples:

         ABCD:EF01:2345:6789:ABCD:EF01:2345:6789

         2001:DB8:0:0:8:800:200C:417A

      Note that it is not necessary to write the leading zeros in an
      individual field, but there must be at least one numeral in every
      field (except for the case described in 2.).




draft-ietf-ipv6-addr-arch-v4-04.txt                             [Page 4]

INTERNET-DRAFT        IPv6 Addressing Architecture              May 2005


   2. Due to some methods of allocating certain styles of IPv6
      addresses, it will be common for addresses to contain long strings
      of zero bits.  In order to make writing addresses containing zero
      bits easier a special syntax is available to compress the zeros.
      The use of "::" indicates one or more groups of 16 bits of zeros.
      The "::" can only appear once in an address.  The "::" can also be
      used to compress leading or trailing zeros in an address.

      For example the following addresses:

         2001:DB8:0:0:8:800:200C:417A   a unicast address
         FF01:0:0:0:0:0:0:101           a multicast address
         0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1                the loopback address
         0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0                the unspecified address

      may be represented as:

         2001:DB8::8:800:200C:417A      a unicast address
         FF01::101                      a multicast address
         ::1                            the loopback address
         ::                             the unspecified address

   3. An alternative form that is sometimes more convenient when dealing
      with a mixed environment of IPv4 and IPv6 nodes is
      x:x:x:x:x:x:d.d.d.d, where the 'x's are the hexadecimal values of
      the six high-order 16-bit pieces of the address, and the 'd's are
      the decimal values of the four low-order 8-bit pieces of the
      address (standard IPv4 representation).  Examples:

         0:0:0:0:0:0:13.1.68.3

         0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:129.144.52.38

      or in compressed form:

         ::13.1.68.3

         ::FFFF:129.144.52.38


2.3 Text Representation of Address Prefixes

   The text representation of IPv6 address prefixes is similar to the
   way IPv4 addresses prefixes are written in CIDR notation [CIDR].  An
   IPv6 address prefix is represented by the notation:

      ipv6-address/prefix-length




draft-ietf-ipv6-addr-arch-v4-04.txt                             [Page 5]

INTERNET-DRAFT        IPv6 Addressing Architecture              May 2005


   where

      ipv6-address    is an IPv6 address in any of the notations listed
                      in Section 2.2.

      prefix-length   is a decimal value specifying how many of the
                      leftmost contiguous bits of the address comprise
                      the prefix.

   For example, the following are legal representations of the 60-bit
   prefix 20010DB80000CD3 (hexadecimal):

      2001:0DB8:0000:CD30:0000:0000:0000:0000/60
      2001:0DB8::CD30:0:0:0:0/60
      2001:0DB8:0:CD30::/60

   The following are NOT legal representations of the above prefix:

      2001:0DB8:0:CD3/60   may drop leading zeros, but not trailing
                           zeros, within any 16-bit chunk of the address

      2001:0DB8::CD30/60   address to left of "/" expands to
                           2001:0DB8:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:CD30

      2001:0DB8::CD3/60    address to left of "/" expands to
                           2001:0DB8:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0CD3

   When writing both a node address and a prefix of that node address
   (e.g., the node's subnet prefix), the two can combined as follows:


      the node address      2001:0DB8:0:CD30:123:4567:89AB:CDEF
      and its subnet number 2001:0DB8:0:CD30::/60

      can be abbreviated as 2001:0DB8:0:CD30:123:4567:89AB:CDEF/60

2.4 Address Type Identification

   The type of an IPv6 address is identified by the high-order bits of
   the address, as follows:


      Address type         Binary prefix        IPv6 notation   Section
      ------------         -------------        -------------   -------
      Unspecified          00...0  (128 bits)   ::/128          2.5.2
      Loopback             00...1  (128 bits)   ::1/128         2.5.3
      Multicast            11111111             FF00::/8        2.7
      Link-local unicast   1111111010           FE80::/10       2.5.6
      Global unicast       (everything else)


   Anycast addresses are taken from the unicast address spaces (of any
   scope) and are not syntactically distinguishable from unicast
   addresses.

   The general format of global unicast addresses is described in
   Section 2.5.4.  Some special-purpose subtypes of global unicast
   addresses which contain embedded IPv4 addresses (for the purposes of
   IPv4-IPv6 interoperation) are described in Section 2.5.5.

   Future specifications may redefine one or more sub-ranges of the
   global unicast space for other purposes, but unless and until that
   happens, implementations must treat all addresses that do not start
   with any of the above-listed prefixes as global unicast addresses.


2.5 Unicast Addresses

   IPv6 unicast addresses are aggregatable with prefixes of arbitrary
   bit-length similar to IPv4 addresses under Classless Interdomain
   Routing.

   There are several types of unicast addresses in IPv6, in particular
   global unicast, site-local unicast (deprecated, see Section 2.5.7),
   and link-local unicast.  There are also some special-purpose subtypes
   of global unicast, such as IPv6 addresses with embedded IPv4
   addresses.  Additional address types or subtypes can be defined in
   the future.

   IPv6 nodes may have considerable or little knowledge of the internal
   structure of the IPv6 address, depending on the role the node plays
   (for instance, host versus router).  At a minimum, a node may
   consider that unicast addresses (including its own) have no internal
   structure:



draft-ietf-ipv6-addr-arch-v4-04.txt                             [Page 7]

INTERNET-DRAFT        IPv6 Addressing Architecture              May 2005


   |                           128 bits                              |
   +-----------------------------------------------------------------+
   |                          node address                           |
   +-----------------------------------------------------------------+


   A slightly sophisticated host (but still rather simple) may
   additionally be aware of subnet prefix(es) for the link(s) it is
   attached to, where different addresses may have different values for
   n:

   |          n bits               |           128-n bits            |
   +-------------------------------+---------------------------------+
   |       subnet prefix           |           interface ID          |
   +-------------------------------+---------------------------------+


   Though a very simple router may have no knowledge of the internal
   structure of IPv6 unicast addresses, routers will more generally have
   knowledge of one or more of the hierarchical boundaries for the
   operation of routing protocols.  The known boundaries will differ
   from router to router, depending on what positions the router holds
   in the routing hierarchy.

   Except for the knowledge of the subnet boundary discussed in the
   previous paragraphs nodes should not make any assumptions about the
   structure of an IPv6 address.


2.5.1 Interface Identifiers

   Interface identifiers in IPv6 unicast addresses are used to identify
   interfaces on a link.  They are required to be unique within a subnet
   prefix.  It is recommended that the same interface identifier not be
   assigned to different nodes on a link.  They may also be unique over
   a broader scope.  In some cases an interface's identifier will be
   derived directly from that interface's link-layer address.  The same
   interface identifier may be used on multiple interfaces on a single
   node, as long as they are attached to different subnets.

   Note that the uniqueness of interface identifiers is independent of
   the uniqueness of IPv6 addresses.  For example, a global unicast
   address may be created with a local scope interface identifier and a
   link-local address may be created with a universal scope interface
   identifier.

   For all unicast addresses, except those that start with binary value
   000, Interface IDs are required to be 64 bits long and to be



draft-ietf-ipv6-addr-arch-v4-04.txt                             [Page 8]

INTERNET-DRAFT        IPv6 Addressing Architecture              May 2005


   constructed in Modified EUI-64 format.

   Modified EUI-64 format based Interface identifiers may have universal
   scope when derived from a universal token (e.g., IEEE 802 48-bit MAC
   or IEEE EUI-64 identifiers [EUI64]) or may have local scope where a
   global token is not available (e.g., serial links, tunnel end-points,
   etc.) or where global tokens are undesirable (e.g., temporary tokens
   for privacy [PRIV]).

   Modified EUI-64 format interface identifiers are formed by inverting
   the "u" bit (universal/local bit in IEEE EUI-64 terminology) when
   forming the interface identifier from IEEE EUI-64 identifiers.  In
   the resulting Modified EUI-64 format the "u" bit is set to one (1) to
   indicate universal scope, and it is set to zero (0) to indicate local
   scope.  The first three octets in binary of an IEEE EUI-64 identifier
   are as follows:


          0       0 0       1 1       2
         |0       7 8       5 6       3|
         +----+----+----+----+----+----+
         |cccc|ccug|cccc|cccc|cccc|cccc|
         +----+----+----+----+----+----+


   written in Internet standard bit-order , where "u" is the
   universal/local bit, "g" is the individual/group bit, and "c" are the
   bits of the company_id.  Appendix A: "Creating Modified EUI-64 format
   Interface Identifiers" provides examples on the creation of Modified
   EUI-64 format based interface identifiers.

   The motivation for inverting the "u" bit when forming an interface
   identifier is to make it easy for system administrators to hand
   configure non-global identifiers when hardware tokens are not
   available.  This is expected to be case for serial links, tunnel end-
   points, etc.  The alternative would have been for these to be of the
   form 0200:0:0:1, 0200:0:0:2, etc., instead of the much simpler
   0:0:0:1, 0:0:0:2, etc.

   IPv6 nodes are not required to validate that interface identifiers
   created with modified EUI-64 tokens with the "u" bit set to universal
   are unique.

   The use of the universal/local bit in the Modified EUI-64 format
   identifier is to allow development of future technology that can take
   advantage of interface identifiers with universal scope.

   The details of forming interface identifiers are defined in the



draft-ietf-ipv6-addr-arch-v4-04.txt                             [Page 9]

INTERNET-DRAFT        IPv6 Addressing Architecture              May 2005


   appropriate "IPv6 over <link>" specification such as "IPv6 over
   Ethernet" [ETHER], "IPv6 over FDDI" [FDDI], etc.


2.5.2 The Unspecified Address

   The address 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0 is called the unspecified address.  It
   must never be assigned to any node.  It indicates the absence of an
   address.  One example of its use is in the Source Address field of
   any IPv6 packets sent by an initializing host before it has learned
   its own address.

   The unspecified address must not be used as the destination address
   of IPv6 packets or in IPv6 Routing Headers.  An IPv6 packet with a
   source address of unspecified must never be forwarded by an IPv6
   router.


2.5.3 The Loopback Address

   The unicast address 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 is called the loopback address.
   It may be used by a node to send an IPv6 packet to itself.  It must
   not be assigned to any physical interface.   It is treated as having
   link-local scope, and may be thought of as the link-local unicast
   address of a virtual interface (typically called "the loopback
   interface") to an imaginary link that goes nowhere.

   The loopback address must not be used as the source address in IPv6
   packets that are sent outside of a single node.  An IPv6 packet with
   a destination address of loopback must never be sent outside of a
   single node and must never be forwarded by an IPv6 router.  A packet
   received on an interface with destination address of loopback must be
   dropped.


2.5.4 Global Unicast Addresses

   The general format for IPv6 global unicast addresses is as follows:

   |         n bits         |   m bits  |       128-n-m bits         |
   +------------------------+-----------+----------------------------+
   | global routing prefix  | subnet ID |       interface ID         |
   +------------------------+-----------+----------------------------+

   where the global routing prefix is a (typically hierarchically-
   structured) value assigned to a site (a cluster of subnets/links),
   the subnet ID is an identifier of a link within the site, and the
   interface ID is as defined in Section 2.5.1.



draft-ietf-ipv6-addr-arch-v4-04.txt                            [Page 10]

INTERNET-DRAFT        IPv6 Addressing Architecture              May 2005


   All global unicast addresses other than those that start with binary
   000 have a 64-bit interface ID field (i.e., n + m = 64), formatted as
   described in Section 2.5.1.  Global unicast addresses that start with
   binary 000 have no such constraint on the size or structure of the
   interface ID field.

   Examples of global unicast addresses that start with binary 000 are
   the IPv6 address with embedded IPv4 addresses described in Section
   2.5.5.  An example of global addresses starting with a binary value
   other than 000 (and therefore having a 64-bit interface ID field) can
   be found in [GLOBAL].


2.5.5 IPv6 Addresses with Embedded IPv4 Addresses

   Two types of IPv6 addresses are defined that carry an IPv4 address in
   the low-order 32 bits of the address.  These are the "IPv4-Compatible
   IPv6 Address" and the "IPv4-Mapped IPv6 Address".


2.5.5.1 IPv4-Compatible IPv6 Address

   The "IPv4-compatible IPv6 address", was defined to assist in the IPv6
   transition.  The format of the "IPv4-compatible IPv6 address" is:

   |                80 bits               | 16 |      32 bits        |
   +--------------------------------------+--------------------------+
   |0000..............................0000|0000|    IPv4 address     |
   +--------------------------------------+----+---------------------+

   Note: The IPv4 address used in the "IPv4-compatible IPv6 address"
   must be a globally-unique IPv4 unicast address.

   The "IPv4-compatible IPv6 address" is now deprecated because the
   current IPv6 transition mechanisms no longer use these addresses.
   New or updated implementations are not required to support this
   address type.


2.5.5.2 IPv4-Mapped IPv6 Address

   A second type of IPv6 address that holds an embedded IPv4 address is
   defined.  This address type is used to represent the addresses of
   IPv4 nodes as IPv6 addresses.  The format of the "IPv4-mapped IPv6
   address" is:

INTERNET-DRAFT        IPv6 Addressing Architecture              May 2005


   |                80 bits               | 16 |      32 bits        |
   +--------------------------------------+--------------------------+
   |0000..............................0000|FFFF|    IPv4 address     |
   +--------------------------------------+----+---------------------+

   See [RFC4038] for background on the usage of the "IPv4-mapped IPv6
   address".


2.5.6 Link-Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses

   Link-Local addresses are for use on a single link.  Link-Local
   addresses have the following format:

   |   10     |
   |  bits    |         54 bits         |          64 bits           |
   +----------+-------------------------+----------------------------+
   |1111111010|           0             |       interface ID         |
   +----------+-------------------------+----------------------------+

   Link-Local addresses are designed to be used for addressing on a
   single link for purposes such as automatic address configuration,
   neighbor discovery, or when no routers are present.

   Routers must not forward any packets with link-local source or
   destination addresses to other links.


2.5.7 Site-Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses

   Site-local addresses were originally designed to be used for
   addressing inside of a site without the need for a global prefix.
   Site-Local addresses are now deprecated as defined in [SLDEP].

   Site-Local addresses have the following format:

   |   10     |
   |  bits    |         54 bits         |         64 bits            |
   +----------+-------------------------+----------------------------+
   |1111111011|        subnet ID        |       interface ID         |
   +----------+-------------------------+----------------------------+

   The special behavior of this prefix defined in [RFC3513] must no
   longer be supported in new implementations (i.e., new implementations
   must treat this prefix as Global Unicast).

   Existing implementations and deployments may continue to use this
   prefix.

2.6 Anycast Addresses

   An IPv6 anycast address is an address that is assigned to more than
   one interface (typically belonging to different nodes), with the
   property that a packet sent to an anycast address is routed to the
   "nearest" interface having that address, according to the routing
   protocols' measure of distance.

   Anycast addresses are allocated from the unicast address space, using
   any of the defined unicast address formats.  Thus, anycast addresses
   are syntactically indistinguishable from unicast addresses.  When a
   unicast address is assigned to more than one interface, thus turning
   it into an anycast address, the nodes to which the address is
   assigned must be explicitly configured to know that it is an anycast
   address.

   For any assigned anycast address, there is a longest prefix P of that
   address that identifies the topological region in which all
   interfaces belonging to that anycast address reside.  Within the
   region identified by P, the anycast address must be maintained as a
   separate entry in the routing system (commonly referred to as a "host
   route"); outside the region identified by P, the anycast address may
   be aggregated into the routing entry for prefix P.

   Note that in the worst case, the prefix P of an anycast set may be
   the null prefix, i.e., the members of the set may have no topological
   locality.  In that case, the anycast address must be maintained as a
   separate routing entry throughout the entire Internet, which presents
   a severe scaling limit on how many such "global" anycast sets may be
   supported.  Therefore, it is expected that support for global anycast
   sets may be unavailable or very restricted.

   One expected use of anycast addresses is to identify the set of
   routers belonging to an organization providing Internet service.
   Such addresses could be used as intermediate addresses in an IPv6
   Routing header, to cause a packet to be delivered via a particular
   service provider or sequence of service providers.

   Some other possible uses are to identify the set of routers attached
   to a particular subnet, or the set of routers providing entry into a
   particular routing domain.


2.6.1 Required Anycast Address

   The Subnet-Router anycast address is predefined.  Its format is as
   follows:




draft-ietf-ipv6-addr-arch-v4-04.txt                            [Page 13]

INTERNET-DRAFT        IPv6 Addressing Architecture              May 2005


   |                         n bits                 |   128-n bits   |
   +------------------------------------------------+----------------+
   |                   subnet prefix                | 00000000000000 |
   +------------------------------------------------+----------------+


   The "subnet prefix" in an anycast address is the prefix which
   identifies a specific link.  This anycast address is syntactically
   the same as a unicast address for an interface on the link with the
   interface identifier set to zero.

   Packets sent to the Subnet-Router anycast address will be delivered
   to one router on the subnet.  All routers are required to support the
   Subnet-Router anycast addresses for the subnets to which they have
   interfaces.

   The subnet-router anycast address is intended to be used for
   applications where a node needs to communicate with any one of the
   set of routers.


2.7 Multicast Addresses

   An IPv6 multicast address is an identifier for a group of interfaces
   (typically on different nodes).  An interface may belong to any
   number of multicast groups.  Multicast addresses have the following
   format:

   |   8    |  4 |  4 |                  112 bits                   |
   +------ -+----+----+---------------------------------------------+
   |11111111|flgs|scop|                  group ID                   |
   +--------+----+----+---------------------------------------------+

      binary 11111111 at the start of the address identifies the address
      as being a multicast address.

                                    +-+-+-+-+
      flgs is a set of 4 flags:     |0|R|P|T|
                                    +-+-+-+-+

         The high-order flag is reserved, and must be initialized to 0.

         T = 0 indicates a permanently-assigned ("well-known") multicast
         address, assigned by the Internet Assigned Number Authority
         (IANA).

         T = 1 indicates a non-permanently-assigned ("transient" or
         "dynamically" assigned) multicast address.



draft-ietf-ipv6-addr-arch-v4-04.txt                            [Page 14]

INTERNET-DRAFT        IPv6 Addressing Architecture              May 2005


         The P flag's definition and usage can be found in [RFC3306].

         The R flag's definition and usage can be found in [RFC3956].

      scop is a 4-bit multicast scope value used to limit the scope of
      the multicast group.  The values are:

         0  reserved
         1  interface-local scope
         2  link-local scope
         3  reserved
         4  admin-local scope
         5  site-local scope
         6  (unassigned)
         7  (unassigned)
         8  organization-local scope
         9  (unassigned)
         A  (unassigned)
         B  (unassigned)
         C  (unassigned)
         D  (unassigned)
         E  global scope
         F  reserved

         interface-local scope spans only a single interface on a
         node, and is useful only for loopback transmission of
         multicast.

         link-local multicast scope spans the same
         topological region as the corresponding unicast scope.

         admin-local scope is the smallest scope that must be
         administratively configured, i.e., not automatically
         derived from physical connectivity or other, non-
         multicast-related configuration.

         site-local scope is intended to span a single site.

         organization-local scope is intended to span multiple
         sites belonging to a single organization.

         scopes labeled "(unassigned)" are available for
         administrators to define additional multicast regions.

      group ID identifies the multicast group, either permanent or
      transient, within the given scope.  Additional definitions of the
      multicast group ID field structure is defined in [RFC3306].




draft-ietf-ipv6-addr-arch-v4-04.txt                            [Page 15]

INTERNET-DRAFT        IPv6 Addressing Architecture              May 2005


   The "meaning" of a permanently-assigned multicast address is
   independent of the scope value.  For example, if the "NTP servers
   group" is assigned a permanent multicast address with a group ID of
   101 (hex), then:


      FF01:0:0:0:0:0:0:101 means all NTP servers on the same interface
      (i.e., the same node) as the sender.

      FF02:0:0:0:0:0:0:101 means all NTP servers on the same link as the
      sender.

      FF05:0:0:0:0:0:0:101 means all NTP servers in the same site as the
      sender.

      FF0E:0:0:0:0:0:0:101 means all NTP servers in the Internet.


   Non-permanently-assigned multicast addresses are meaningful only
   within a given scope.  For example, a group identified by the non-
   permanent, site-local multicast address FF15:0:0:0:0:0:0:101 at one
   site bears no relationship to a group using the same address at a
   different site, nor to a non-permanent group using the same group ID
   with different scope, nor to a permanent group with the same group
   ID.

   Multicast addresses must not be used as source addresses in IPv6
   packets or appear in any Routing header.

   Routers must not forward any multicast packets beyond of the scope
   indicated by the scop field in the destination multicast address.

   Nodes must not originate a packet to a multicast address whose scop
   field contains the reserved value 0; if such a packet is received, it
   must be silently dropped.  Nodes should not originate a packet to a
   multicast address whose scop field contains the reserved value F; if
   such a packet is sent or received, it must be treated the same as
   packets destined to a global (scop E) multicast address.


2.7.1 Pre-Defined Multicast Addresses

   The following well-known multicast addresses are pre-defined.  The
   group ID's defined in this section are defined for explicit scope
   values.

   Use of these group IDs for any other scope values, with the T flag
   equal to 0, is not allowed.

                                      FF0F:0:0:0:0:0:0:0

   The above multicast addresses are reserved and shall never be
   assigned to any multicast group.

      All Nodes Addresses:    FF01:0:0:0:0:0:0:1
                              FF02:0:0:0:0:0:0:1

   The above multicast addresses identify the group of all IPv6 nodes,
   within scope 1 (interface-local) or 2 (link-local).

      All Routers Addresses:   FF01:0:0:0:0:0:0:2
                               FF02:0:0:0:0:0:0:2

   The above multicast addresses identify the group of all IPv6 routers,
   within scope 1 (interface-local), 2 (link-local), or 5 (site-local).

      Solicited-Node Address:  FF02:0:0:0:0:1:FFXX:XXXX

   Solicited-node multicast address are computed as a function of a
   node's unicast and anycast addresses.  A solicited-node multicast
   address is formed by taking the low-order 24 bits of an address
   (unicast or anycast) and appending those bits to the prefix
   FF02:0:0:0:0:1:FF00::/104 resulting in a multicast address in the
   range

         FF02:0:0:0:0:1:FF00:0000

   to

         FF02:0:0:0:0:1:FFFF:FFFF

INTERNET-DRAFT        IPv6 Addressing Architecture              May 2005


   For example, the solicited node multicast address corresponding to
   the IPv6 address 4037::01:800:200E:8C6C is FF02::1:FF0E:8C6C.  IPv6
   addresses that differ only in the high-order bits, e.g. due to
   multiple high-order prefixes associated with different aggregations,
   will map to the same solicited-node address thereby, reducing the
   number of multicast addresses a node must join.

   A node is required to compute and join (on the appropriate interface)
   the associated Solicited-Node multicast addresses for all Unicast and
   Anycast Addresses that have been configured for the node's interfaces
   (manually or automatically).


2.8 A Node's Required Addresses

   A host is required to recognize the following addresses as
   identifying itself:

      o Its required Link-Local Address for each interface.
      o Any additional Unicast and Anycast Addresses that have been
        configured for the node's interfaces (manually or
        automatically).
      o The loopback address.
      o The All-Nodes Multicast Addresses defined in Section 2.7.1.
      o The Solicited-Node Multicast Address for each of its unicast and
        anycast addresses.
      o Multicast Addresses of all other groups to which the node
        belongs.

   A router is required to recognize all addresses that a host is
   required to recognize, plus the following addresses as identifying
   itself:

      o The Subnet-Router Anycast Addresses for all interfaces for which
        it is configured to act as a router.
      o All other Anycast Addresses with which the router has been
        configured.
      o The All-Routers Multicast Addresses defined in Section 2.7.1.


3. Security Considerations

   IPv6 addressing documents do not have any direct impact on Internet
   infrastructure security.  Authentication of IPv6 packets is defined
   in [AUTH].

4. IANA Considerations

   The "IPv4-compatible IPv6 address" is deprecated by this document.
   The IANA should continue to list the address block containing these
   addresses at http://www.iana.org/assignments/ipv6-address-space as
   "Reserved by IETF" and not reassign it for any other purpose.  For
   example:

      0000::/8        Reserved by IETF        [RFC3513]      [1]

   The IANA is requested to add the following note and link it to this
   address block.

      [5]  0000::/96 was previously defined as the "IPv4-compatible IPv6
           address" prefix.  This definition has been deprecated by
           [RFC-ietf-ipv6-addr-arch-v4-04.txt].

   The IANA is requested to update the references for the IPv6 Address
   Architecture in the IANA registries to this RFC when it is published.

APPENDIX A: Creating Modified EUI-64 format Interface Identifiers
------------------------------------------------------------------

   Depending on the characteristics of a specific link or node there are
   a number of approaches for creating Modified EUI-64 format interface
   identifiers.  This appendix describes some of these approaches.


   Links or Nodes with IEEE EUI-64 Identifiers

   The only change needed to transform an IEEE EUI-64 identifier to an
   interface identifier is to invert the "u" (universal/local) bit.  For
   example, a globally unique IEEE EUI-64 identifier of the form:

   |0              1|1              3|3              4|4              6|
   |0              5|6              1|2              7|8              3|
   +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
   |cccccc0gcccccccc|ccccccccmmmmmmmm|mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm|mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm|
   +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+

   where "c" are the bits of the assigned company_id, "0" is the value
   of the universal/local bit to indicate universal scope, "g" is
   individual/group bit, and "m" are the bits of the manufacturer-
   selected extension identifier.  The IPv6 interface identifier would
   be of the form:

   |0              1|1              3|3              4|4              6|
   |0              5|6              1|2              7|8              3|
   +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
   |cccccc1gcccccccc|ccccccccmmmmmmmm|mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm|mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm|
   +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+

   The only change is inverting the value of the universal/local bit.


   Links or Nodes with IEEE 802 48 bit MAC's

   [EUI64] defines a method to create a IEEE EUI-64 identifier from an
   IEEE 48bit MAC identifier.  This is to insert two octets, with
   hexadecimal values of 0xFF and 0xFE, in the middle of the 48 bit MAC
   (between the company_id and vendor supplied id).  For example the 48
   bit IEEE MAC with global scope:

   |0              1|1              3|3              4|
   |0              5|6              1|2              7|
   +----------------+----------------+----------------+
   |cccccc0gcccccccc|ccccccccmmmmmmmm|mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm|
   +----------------+----------------+----------------+

   where "c" are the bits of the assigned company_id, "0" is the value
   of the universal/local bit to indicate global scope, "g" is
   individual/group bit, and "m" are the bits of the manufacturer-
   selected extension identifier.  The interface identifier would be of
   the form:

   |0              1|1              3|3              4|4              6|
   |0              5|6              1|2              7|8              3|
   +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
   |cccccc1gcccccccc|cccccccc11111111|11111110mmmmmmmm|mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm|
   +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+

   When IEEE 802 48bit MAC addresses are available (on an interface or a
   node), an implementation may use them to create interface identifiers
   due to their availability and uniqueness properties.


   Links with Other Kinds of Identifiers

   There are a number of types of links that have link-layer interface
   identifiers other than IEEE EUI-64 or IEEE 802 48-bit MACs.  Examples
   include LocalTalk and Arcnet.  The method to create an Modified
   EUI-64 format identifier is to take the link identifier (e.g., the
   LocalTalk 8 bit node identifier) and zero fill it to the left.  For
   example a LocalTalk 8 bit node identifier of hexadecimal value 0x4F
   results in the following interface identifier:

   |0              1|1              3|3              4|4              6|
   |0              5|6              1|2              7|8              3|
   +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
   |0000000000000000|0000000000000000|0000000000000000|0000000001001111|
   +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+

   Note that this results in the universal/local bit set to "0" to
   indicate local scope.


   Links without Identifiers

   There are a number of links that do not have any type of built-in
   identifier.  The most common of these are serial links and configured
   tunnels.  Interface identifiers must be chosen that are unique within

INTERNET-DRAFT        IPv6 Addressing Architecture              May 2005


   a subnet-prefix.

   When no built-in identifier is available on a link the preferred
   approach is to use a universal interface identifier from another
   interface or one which is assigned to the node itself.  When using
   this approach no other interface connecting the same node to the same
   subnet-prefix may use the same identifier.

   If there is no universal interface identifier available for use on
   the link the implementation needs to create a local-scope interface
   identifier.  The only requirement is that it be unique within a
   subnet prefix.  There are many possible approaches to select a
   subnet-prefix-unique interface identifier.  These include:

      Manual Configuration
      Node Serial Number
      Other node-specific token

   The subnet-prefix-unique interface identifier should be generated in
   a manner that it does not change after a reboot of a node or if
   interfaces are added or deleted from the node.

   The selection of the appropriate algorithm is link and implementation
   dependent.  The details on forming interface identifiers are defined
   in the appropriate "IPv6 over <link>" specification.  It is strongly
   recommended that a collision detection algorithm be implemented as
   part of any automatic algorithm.

APPENDIX B: Changes from RFC-3513
---------------------------------

   The following changes were made from RFC-3513 "IP Version 6
   Addressing Architecture":

    o The restrictions on using IPv6 anycast addresses were removed
      because there is now sufficient experience with the use of anycast
      addresses, the issues are not specific to IPv6, and the GROW
      working group is working in this area.

    o Deprecated the Site-Local unicast prefix.  Changes included
       - Removed Site-Local from special list of prefixes in Section
         2.4.
       - Split section titled "Local-use IPv6 Unicast Addresses" into
         two sections, "Link-Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses" and "Site-
         Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses".
       - Added text to new section describing Site-Local deprecation.

    o Changes to resolve issues raised in IAB response to Robert Elz
      appeal.  Changes include:
       - Added clarification to Section 2.5 that nodes should make no
         assumptions about the structure of an IPv6 address.
       - Changed the text in Section 2.5.1 and Appendix A to refer to
         the modified EUI-64 format interface identifiers with the "u"
         bit set to one (1) as universal.
       - Added clarification to Section 2.5.1 that IPv6 nodes are not
         required to validate that interface identifiers created in
         modified EUI-64 format with the "u" bit set to one are unique.

    o Changed the reference indicated in Section 2.5.4 "Global Unicast
      Addresses" to RFC3587.

    o Removed mention of NSAP addresses in examples.

    o Clarified that the "x" in the textual representation can be one to
      four digits.

    o Deprecated the "IPv6 Compatible Address" because it is not being
      used in the IPv6 transition mechanisms.

    o Added the "R" and "P" flags to Section 2.7 on Multicast addresses,
      and pointers to the documents that define them.

    o Editorial changes.
