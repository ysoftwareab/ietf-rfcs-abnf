           draft-spallagatti-rtgwg-bandwidth-based-metric-01

Abstract

   This document describes a method to group multiple interfaces and
   assign metric to that group based on the cumulative bandwidth of all
   the interfaces in that group.  Each link in a group takes same group
   metric irrespective of its own bandwidth.

1.  Introduction

   A low cost path is always preferred to carry traffic from source to
   destination.  If a application is more interested in bandwidth than
   the cost itself and most preferred path does not satisfy bandwidth
   then this could potentially lead to congestion and packet loss for an
   application.  Bandwidth critical applications needs minimum bandwidth
   to be satisfied even if traffic is carried over multiple alternative
   paths to reach a destination.

                        Figure 1: Example Topology

   Consider the topology as show in Figure 1.  The device R1 uses a
   links L1, L2 and L3 to carry traffic to destination D1.  Similarly it
   uses links L4, L5 and L6 for destination D2.  However in the event of
   links L1 and/or L2 fails traffic is still forwarded on link L3
   causing traffic congestion.

   In such situations operators will prefer the traffic for destination
   D1 is forwarded on L4, L5 and L6, as there is lesser chance of
   congestion.  Similarly when links L4 and L5 also fails, the operator
   will prefer the traffic for D1 is forwarded is switched back on link
   L3 again.  This document proposes a method called Bandwidth Based
   Metrics (hereafter referred as BBM), which helps achieving this
   desired behaviour.

   BBM, on detecting a local link event, attempts to re-route traffic,
   based on remaining bandwidth across the links on the primary and
   alternate paths.  When the remaining available bandwidth on the
   primary link(s) goes below a permissible limit (to be specified by
   the operator), traffic should be re-routed to one or more groups of
   alternative paths, and re-distributed onto multiple alternate paths
   with lesser likeliness of congesting them.

   This document also specifies how to extend Fast Re-Route (FRR) for
   BBM to meet stringent re-convergence time constraints, and minimize
   traffic loss due to network congestion caused by standard FRR
   mechanisms.

2.1.  Interface-Group

   BBM method proposed in this document requires grouping of all the
   local links (or interfaces) attached to a node into one or more
   logical bundles.  Such a logical grouping of multiple local
   interfaces is called an interface-group, and needs to be provisioned
   manually by the operator on each node.  While assigning the local
   interfaces to a interface-group, all links connecting the local node
   to the same one-hop neighbor, SHOULD be assigned to a single
   interface-group.  In other words the number of interface-group to be
   created on a node SHOULD be at the least, the number of one-hop
   neighbor nodes the particular node is connected to.

   In Figure 1 links L1, L2, and L3 connecting R1 and R2 can be grouped
   into a single interface group (say IG1) on both R1 and R2.  Similarly
   links L4, L5 and L6 connecting R1 and R3 can be grouped into another
   single interface-group (say IG2) on both R1 and R3.

2.2.  BBM Metric Configurations

   All the interfaces under a given interface-group shall share a metric
   that is proportionate to the cumulative bandwidth available using the
   individual links under the interface-group. if a link is associated
   with interface-group then interface-group metric MUST override
   individual link metric configuration.  Implementations SHOULD allow
   operator to specify what metric should be associated for a given
   total remaining available bandwidth for each interface group.
   Implementations SHOULD also allow operator specify the default metric
   to be used for each interface-group.

   In Figure 1, considering all the links L1 to L6 having bandwidth
   capacity of 100G each, and assigned into two interface-groups IG1 and
   IG2 (as shown in Section 2.1), following is an example of simple BBM
   config for each of these interface-group.

          IG1:
             Member-Links: L1,L2,L3
             Total-Available-BW: 200G,  Metric: 10
             Total-Available-BW: 100G,  Metric: 50
             Default-Metric: 1000

          IG2:
             Member-Links: L4,L5,L6
             Total-Available-BW: 200G,  Metric: 10
             Total-Available-BW: 100G,  Metric: 50
             Default-Metric: 1000

2.4.  Metric Derivation

   Once a interface has been assigned to a interface-group, and the
   corresponding BBM metric configurations has been provisioned, metric
   to be associated with the member interfaces can be derived as
   follows:

Sort igp.BBM_Metric_Cfg_List in descending order based on BBM_Metric_Cfg_Entry.Bandwidth
Set Intf.Metric = 0
For (all BBM_Metric_Cfg_Entry in igp.BBM_Metric_Cfg_List
     in descending order)
    - If (igp.BW_Curr >=
          igp.BBM_Metric_Cfg_List.BBM_Metric_Cfg_Entry.Bandwidth)
          - Set Intf.Metric =
                igp.BBM_Metric_Cfg_List.BBM_Metric_Cfg_Entry.Metric.
                                end the loop.
If (Intf.Metric == 0)
    - Set Intf.Metric = igp.Default_Metric.

   Considering the BBM metric configurations for interface-group IG1 in
   Figure 2, Table 2 below shows how metric for individual interfaces of
   IG1 SHALL be computed at any point of time.

3.  Bandwidth Based Routing

   Once the metric of individual interfaces are derived from the
   corresponding interface-group BBM configuration, the same are used in
   the local IGP SPF computations.  In addition to using the metrics in
   SPF computations, the same are also advertised as the corresponding
   link cost (instead of the original cost associated with the
   individual links) in the locally-generated IGP link-state
   advertisements.  This is done to eliminate any looping possible
   otherwise.

   Considering the topology in Figure 1, Table 3 below shows how traffic
   for destination D1 shall be re-routed based on a series of events and
   BBM metric configurations as shown in Figure 2.

4.  Bandwidth-based Fast Reroute

4.1.  Overview

   The BBM solution described in Section 2 requires IGPs running on the
   control plane of the network device, to detect the link failures,
   determine remaining available bandwidth, re-compute new optimum
   paths, and finally install the new best paths to the forwarding
   plane.  This may take some time (in the order of 500 ms) for the
   traffic to switch to a better path.

Internet-Draft         IGP bandwidth based metric            August 2015


   Also, even if regular FRR mechanism using LFA [RFC5286] and Remote-
   LFA [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-remote-lfa] has been deployed, the alternate
   paths chosen is not guaranteed to meet bandwidth constraints.  Also,
   though, [RFC5286] does not specify anything, most LFA implementations
   in link-state protocols running on the network devices around the
   world, employs use of a single backup link.  Also if there are
   multiple primary interfaces for a specific destinations, most
   implementations do not install a alternate path in the forwarding
   plane.  So in the event of the primary link (or one of the multiple
   primary links) going down, traffic is either switched to a single
   interface, or not switched to any other link at all.  In the first
   case, there is more likeliness of the single alternate path getting
   congested (as it might be already carrying some primary traffic for
   other destinations already).  In the latter case, there is more
   likeliness of causing a congestion on the remaining primary links
   (e.g. for destination D1, if both L1 and L2 goes down R1 still keeps
   the traffic on L3 during local repair, trying to push 300G traffic on
   a single 100G link L5).

   Service providers who have stringent bandwidth requirements would
   need the device to switch the traffic during local repair to multiple
   alternate paths that have bandwidth constraints satisfied.  When the
   remaining primary OR alternate paths alone cannot satisfy bandwidth
   requirements, it will also be desirable, to redistribute the traffic
   over a combination of primary AND alternate paths, during local
   repair as well as next SPF computations in IGP.

   This document proposes a solution the above problem, based on
   combination of BBM logic (referred to in Section 2) and protection
   using LFA [RFC5286] and Remote-LFA [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-remote-lfa].  It
   requires a group of primary links to be protected using multiple non-
   best feasible alternate paths.  The same group of alternate links
   shall also be pre-installed in forwarding table to facilitate fast
   re-route (FRR).  The details of the solution is specified in the
   following sub-sections.

4.2.  Assumptions and Pre-requisites

   Following are some of the assumptions that the solution proposed in
   this document is based on.

      The forwarding plane SHOULD be able handle multiple paths per
      route and let control plane set the preference for each path over
      the others.  The forwarding machinery shall utilize this, to
      select a subset of preferred paths, and use them to forward actual
      traffic at any given point in time.  Forwarding machinery SHOULD
      also load balance traffic with next-hops having same preference

      All the links attached to the network device are bundled to create
      one or more interface-group(s).  Also a link MUST belong to one
      and only one interface-group.

      Loops are possible if protection is enabled on all three routes
      R1, R2 and R3 as shown in Figure 1.  To avoid loops implementation
      MUST have downstream Path Criterion as explained in LFA [RFC5286]

      For each interface-group, operator MAY enable protection by
      configuring the following two parameters.

         Minimum-bandwidth: When the remaining bandwidth goes below this
         the outgoing traffic can no more be carried entirely on this
         bundle.  Some of it shall be distributed across links of other
         best/non-best interface-groups.

         Restore-bandwidth: When the remaining bandwidth exceeds this,
         the outgoing traffic can entirely be back over the members of
         this bundle and there is no need to use any other backup for
         all destinations reachable over the links of the bundle.

4.3.  Additional Configuration and Attributes

   This document defines the following configuration parameters to be
   associated with each interface-group for facilitating Bandwidth-based
   Fast Re-Route.  Implementations MUST allow operators to configure
   these parameters for each interface-group on a network device that
   implements this solution.

   |            | traffic MUST not be carried on this interface-group. |

   |            | best interface-groups as well.                       |

4.4.  Enhancements to Local Repair in Forwarding Plane

   Additionally, the solution proposed in this document also mandates,
   that the forwarding plane SHOULD implement the following enhanced
   local-repair logic, to facilitate BBM based fast-re-route, on
   detecting a link-down event.

For each affected prefix (a prefix is affected if the fated link was
one of the preferred active paths used for forwarding).
- Find the actual affected path, and mark it unusable.
- For all other paths downloaded from control-plane,
  - If the preference is same as that of the affected path,
    - Modify its preference to value even lower than normal backup paths.
Finally, go through all remaining active paths
- Select a subset of paths (that share the same highest preference among all),
- Use the selected subset of paths to actually forward traffic.

4.5.  Influencing Path Preferences

   Like mentioned in Section 4.2 the solution proposed in this document
   relies on the preference-based local-repair logic implemented in
   forwarding-plane to facilitate fast re-route.  This solution requires
   IGPs to indirectly influence the local-repair action taken by the
   forwarding-plane by choosing an suitable alternate path with an
   appropriate preference-value pre-computed and installed in the
   forwarding-plane, well ahead of the actual link failure event.

   Table 7 below, specifies a set path-preference types that this
   document proposes IGP to define and use while downloading any path
   for a given destination in the forwarding table.

   | Pri_Nh_Pref         | Preference type for normal primary paths.   |
   |                     |                                             |
   | Bkup_Nh_Pref_High   | Preference type for paths, which are        |
   |                     | preferred, more than normal backup paths    |
   |                     | but less compared to normal primary paths.  |
   |                     |                                             |

4.6.  Path Selection and Preference

   and attributes the document proposes IGPs to implement the following
   logic for computing primary and alternate paths for each destination,

5.  Limitations

   The BBM method proposed in this document does NOT ensure end to end
   bandwidth requirement.  It, only ensures that the metric is altered
   only on local interfaces, based on the BBM metric configurations and
   remaining available bandwidth.

   The solution proposed in this documents attempts to provide
   protection for single link failures only.  It always assumes that
   link with the highest individual bandwidth capacity shall fail next.
   In case if any other link with lesser individual bandwidth capacity
   fails instead, the local repair action taken by the forwarding plane
   may not be exactly as expected, even though the forwarding plane will
   still take care of protecting the traffic.

6.  Security Consideration

   Changes suggested in the draft does not raise any security concerns.
