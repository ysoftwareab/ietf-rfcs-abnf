    Internet-Draft          Spectrum Map for PAWS             December 2013 
        

                                                                   Abstract 

       White space allocation and reutilization has attracted increasing 
       attention since they allow a more efficient way to gather spectrum 
       usage information and keep assigning a proper spectrum to a 
       secondary user. This document provides an extended protocol to 
       construct a specific white space usage map with better interaction 
       between devices and spectrum database. By this mechanism, the Master 
       device or Slave Device sends the environmental spectrum to the 
       Database and obtains more frequency points to select the most 
       appropriate white space spectrum it could use in the local 
       regulatory domain. With regard to White Space Database, more white 
       space information can be recorded for devices to choose. The 
       mechanism is an extension of protocol to access spectrum database. 
       We develop extended protocol data models under different scenarios 
       to enhance interaction of these networks.

    1. Introduction 

       By virtue of dynamic spectrum access technologies, PAWS protocol and 
       technology have developed into a standardized process and the 
       related industrial solutions have been gradually implemented. In 
       theory, the Database manages and distributes the available spectrum 
       in a regulatory domain to the Master Device, but in reality, these

       available spectra that could cover this whole area are much scarcer. 
       According to the white space access experiments such as Google, when 
       the white space device (WSD) queries a trusted white space database 
       (WSDB) for a list of white space spectrum or channels, the database 
       responsible for this area often provide some spectra sensed which 
       can be covered through the whole area. Consequently, too many 
       requests will lead available spectrum congestion, which violates the 
       white space spirit, while more local white spaces with small limited 
       coverage are neglected. This is because the spectrum information is 
       often collected by database direct sensing, which is insufficient 
       and inefficient. Actually the available spectrum in a certain area 
       is more than that WSDB can provide. This low spectrum accuracy 
       problem might lead to a great waste for available spectrum in a 
       local area. Unfortunately, little work has been done for this. 

       With respect to such spectrum measurement and management issues, the 
       European scholars are endeavoring to construct Radio Environmental 
       Maps (REMs) via FARAMIR project, to obtain reliable spatial spectrum 
       measurements. Some prototype and exploratory experiments such as 
       spectrum use in London are deployed and finished. But this topic is 
       mainly focused on spectrum sensing and cooperating use of sensing 
       devices such as USRP2s, WARP, SunSPOTs and etc. Challenges remain 
       that how to enhance spectrum information exchange via ground data 
       with the operation entities.  

       To solve this problem, we propose a spectrum map method and a 
       protocol to handle the accuracy issue and provide more spectra to 
       WSD. When a WSD is requesting the white space spectrum from database, 
       they locally send available spectrum information to the WSDB to 
       piece them together and form a specific spectrum map at a given time 
       and location. A primary goal is to improve the available spectrum 
       accuracy. Correspondingly, more spectra can be allocated to the WSD 
       to improve the white space usage ratio and scalability. Our protocol 
       is an expansion of the existing PAWS protocol. By virtue of existing 
       parameters definition, the proposed function is easy to implement 
       since no extra parameters would be introduced.

       This is an advanced function of WSDB with a more specific 
       description for spectrum usage situation. Through the interaction 
       between WSD and WSDB instead of arbitrary assignment by WSDB to a 
       WSD, more spectrum usage information can be exchanged to improve the 
       spectrum resource efficiency.   

       This function can be integrated into a normal WSDB or an advanced 
       server administrator with other auxiliary functions such as spectrum 
       discovering or identifying. It depends on the regulatory domain 
       scope and performance requirement. 

       This draft is in scope for the reason that it could provide more 
       spectrum information to solve the database sensing accuracy problem. 
       Moreover, the white space device could receive a list of available 
       white space spectra fully qualified via a specified user activity 
       condition with a reasonable efficiency boosting. 

    3. Protocol Overview 

       In this section we will introduce an improved general protocol 
       process of spectrum query based on the collected spectrum 
       information, which is noted as the spectrum usage map, to provide 
       more available spectra. Our method can enhance the database spectrum 
       accuracy, further solving the efficiency and scalability problems. 

    3.1. Problem description 

       PAWS is proposed to achieve interoperability among multiple devices 
       and databases to maximize overall unused spectrum utilization. In 
       general operation of spectrum request, the Master Device discovers 
       the Database in this regulatory domain and sends a spectrum request. 
       Then the Database responses a schedule of spectrum from the spectrum 
       list, so that WSD could select the appropriate spectrum to use.  

       In this process, an available spectrum is locally sensed by Database 
       in a specific area. In another word, the spectrum is available if 
       this spectrum can be used within this whole regulatory domain range. 
       For example, at Haidian District in Beijing, a few of largely 
       sensible spectra can be used in this local area at a certain time 
       interval. But for a more specific spot, in addition to the largely 
       sensed spectra, more tiny and dense white spaces are free to occupy. 
       So these white space detection and utilization can immensely relieve 
       the pressure of largely sensible spectrum access. 

       Motivated by these observations, our goal is to acquire more locally 
       available spectra to improve the spectrum accuracy. The interaction 
       between WSD and Database could be divided into the following steps: 
     
     
    <Zhang>                 Expires June 12, 2014                 [Page 4]

       local spectrum join, map construction, spectrum response and 
       spectrum reallocation. Databases would be responsible of recording 
       and analyzing the information to build the map and provide more 
       spectra to WSD. Meanwhile, if a new WSD with similar activity 
       requests a spectrum, the Database can provide a similar available 
       spectrum list in this area. This mechanism can greatly increase the 
       resources availability.  

    3.2. Parameter definition 

       Obviously we need a parameter to describe such a spectrum join 
       request. According to a series of parameter definitions in the 
       latest PAWS protocol draft version 6, the GeoSpectrumSchedule 
       parameter format is originally used in AVAIL_SPECTRUM_BATCH_RESP 
       request, to return a schedule of available spectrum at a location. 
       Here in order to extend the protocol with compatibility and 
       continuity, this format can be used in AVAIL_SPECTRUM_BATCH_REQ, to 
       directly provide a schedule of locally available spectrum at current 
       location and time. Hence the existing data structure can be 
       exploited immediately without new data structure modification. As 
       shown in the table 1: 

           +-------------------------------+------------------------------+ 
           |AVAIL_SPECTRUM_BATCH_REQ       |                              |

           |geoSpectrumSchedules:list      | required                     |

       The starttime and stoptime in GeoSpectrumSchedule can be extracted 
       either or quantized to a time interval later. 

       On the other hand, we can combine location and SpectrumSchedule 
       parameters to provide such a Spectrum Join Request with temperal-
       spatial spectrum information instead of the GeoSpectrumSchedule 
       parameter ahead. As shown in the table 2:

    3.3. Map data model 

       The temperal-spatial spectrum information will be stored in map 
       model in the form of multi-dimensional distribution. How to build a 
       data structure in database to analyze the data is a critical issue. 
       Such historic observations processed by related big data technology 
       support and dynamic database solutions will be discussed in future. 
       As well as the detailed map formulation, for the sake of monitor the 
       realtime incoming data, user interface display will benefit to 
       visualize a description to the spectrum occupancy activity. 

    3.4. General process 

       1 Spectrum Join Request 

       A WSD keeps detecting available white spectrum in a sensible range. 
       When idle spectra detected, The WSD sends a spectrum request with 
       white space information to the database. White space information 
       mainly includes WSD geographical location, the detection time, a 
       list of available spectrum and etc. 

       2 Spectrum Map Construction 

       WSDB gathers the received information to construct spectrum activity 
       map. This is a dynamic process of data processing via interaction 
       with WSD. The database could update spectrum information 
       periodically and rank them with usage priority. 

       3 Spectrum Response 

       Within the spectrum response message, WSDB chooses available 
       spectrum information according to the updated spectrum map, assigns 
       it to WSD. This spectrum list could be shortlisted but actually more 
       reasonable information is contained than before.  
     
     
    <Zhang>                 Expires June 12, 2014                 [Page 6] 
        
    Internet-Draft          Spectrum Map for PAWS             December 2013 
        

       4 Spectrum Reallocation 

       Furthermore, when a new request from this WSD or another WSD with 
       similar activity arriving, the database can quickly provide it with 
       the same expanded spectrum information. In addition, WSD could claim 
       the spectrum usage request to database for a permission of spectrum 
       occupancy. 

    4. Scenario Application 

       In this section we will elaborate the implementation process of two 
       basic message exchange mechanisms under real scenarios. According to 
       the spectrum query manner, we classify the protocol form as passive 
       mode and proactive mode. The passive mode is thought to build Map 
       and assign spectrum to WSD by database. The proactive mode is 
       thought to launch Map construction spectrum request by WSD. 
       According to the relationship between devices, we classify the 
       scenarios as master-slave type and mixed type scenarios. 

       Generally speaking, the spectrum coverage of macrocell or microcell 
       could be divided into several blocks by power strength and 
       transmitter location. In our protocol, the database can be deployed 
       in view of WSD activity as well as signal sensing and practical 
       network scale consideration. In this regard, our proposed scheme can 
       reduce the number of required spectrum-sensing databases while 
       offering more locally adapted spectrum information to improve 
       equipment utilization. 

    4.1. Passive mode 

       In most cases, a master device is in charge of a group of Slave 
       Devices physically located to it and distributes them a spectrum 
       uniformly. Here we suppose this case as master-slave scenario. In 
       mixed scenario, Slave Devices will be treated as a standalone entity 
       with master device, together regarding as WSD or secondary users, to 
       exploit tiny spectrum opportunity flexibly. Our protocol can be 
       shown as follows.

        Figure 1 An overview of procedures of spectrum query in passive mode 

       (1) Spectrum Join Request procedure 

       The first two messages are used to send available spectrum 
       information to WSDB by Master Device collected by a Slave Device. It 
       conveys the available spectrum list at the WSD's given location at 
       that time interval. The data structure is in line with 
       GeoSpectrumSchedule format aforementioned. Other types of related 
       information will TBD. 

       (2) Spectrum Map Construction Procedure 

       These two steps of database are used to gather available spectrum 
       information to construct map by WSDB. It conveys the available 
       spectrum list at a certain location of Slave Device at that time. In 
       this process, time quantization and spectrum sorting are necessary 
       to simplify the big data produced by numerous Slave Devices along 
       the time distribution. This kind of good spectrum with high 
       priority would be qualified as QoS criteria such as less handoff,

       strong signal strength and etc. The specific process methods will 
       depend on actual conditions. 

       (3) Spectrum Response procedure 

       The second two messages are used to return available spectrum 
       information to a Slave Device by WSDB. This procedure conveys a 
       listing of one or more proper spectra to Master Device. Since 
       locally sensed and user detected spectra are both taken into account 
       by the database, this available spectrum list is more practical and 
       effective than that in original protocol. 

       After WSDB returning the spectrum information, the master device can 
       straightly select a best one from the list and assign it to that 
       Slave Device or a group of Slave Devices. The subsequent interaction 
       of spectrum acknowledgement follows the original protocol. 

       (4) Spectrum reallocation procedure 

       In next spectrum request initiated by a same Slave Device or a new 
       Slave Device with similar activity, that is, in neighborhood at a 
       time very close to it, they can quickly receive a shortlisted 
       spectrum response. 

       For the original Slave Device, it could quickly apply available 
       white space spectrum from the WSDB with such historical information 
       stored in spectrum Map. For a new WSD, it could enjoy more spectra 
       to choose and apply a proper spectrum from the WSDB with such 
       historical information. This will facilitate and accelerate the 
       white space negotiation process. 

       We can further generalize the master device and Slave Device as 
       white space device. Such a WSD can communicate with Database 
       directly without delivered by Master Device. 

    4.1.2. Mixed scenario 

       We can further generalize the master device and Slave Device as a 
       WSD. This could be deemed as a mixed user case where single white 
       space user is involved as main device, same as base station acted as 
       the Master Device. Such a WSD can straightly communicate with 
       Database to apply a spectrum independently without delivered by 
       Master Device.

    4.2. Proactive mode 

       Other than the mechanisms that the WSD awaits the database to 
       analyze data and send a response, we have an alternative solution to 
       supplement the passive mode aforementioned. The WSD will query the 
       database if it could arbitrarily occupy a detected spectrum. The 
       message exchange process is shown as follows.

                    |    WSD     |           |     WSDB    |

        Figure 2 An overview of procedures of spectrum query in proactive mode 

       (1) Spectrum Usage Request procedure 

       The WSD locally selects a proper spectrum and send a request with a 
       spectrum Usage Request. This request also takes a 
       GeoSpectrumSchedule format and usually carried one or more pieces of 
       wanted spectrum information. Thus a boolean flag may be required to 
       denote the message as a usage request rather than a join request. 

       (2) Spectrum Usage Response procedure 

       The WSDB would check the historical spectrum information with the 
       map to judge if this spectrum has been assigned. If the spectrum is 
       either available or never recorded before, the database will 
       directly return a SPECTRUM_USE_RESP message. Correspondingly, the 
       spectrum information will be added into the map. 
     
     
    <Zhang>                 Expires June 12, 2014                [Page 10] 
        
    Internet-Draft          Spectrum Map for PAWS             December 2013 
        

       Or else, if the spectrum is unsuitable for use like assigned or 
       blacklisted, the database will straightly return a spectrum response 
       with a refuse acknowledgement. Since now spectrum access is not 
       authorized at the WSD physical location, the database will 
       response an AVAIL_SPEC_BATCH RESP message contained an error code 
       and selected spectra information list for use. Error code can be 
       defined to label the reject type. Then the WSD makes a spectrum 
       decision and send SPECTRUM_USE_NOTIFY message to confirm the 
       spectrum usage in accordance with the original protocol. The 
       database simply acknowledges the notification. 

    5. Security Considerations 

       By using the aforementioned protocol, the Master Device and the 
       Database expose themselves to the following risks: 

          Accuracy: A Master Device may receive inaccurate spectrum 
          availability information, such as incorrect or outdated spectrum. 

          DDos attack: a database may receive false information by a WSD. 

       But do not worry. This protocol exploits inherent protection from 
       these risks depending on the following reasons. 

       When such risks occur, if a database keeps receiving false or 
       malicious information by a WSD, the database and other users could 
       not be affected. With regard to the WSD itself, the false spectrum 
       list will be returned to this WSD for self-use. For other WSDs, such 
       false information can be treated as isolated point in big data 
       gathered from numerous users and the influence is tiny. Besides, 
       some other illegal use of spectrum threats and relevant terrorist 
       model would be discussed in future. 

    6. IANA Considerations 

       This document makes no request of IANA. 

    7. Conclusions 

       This memo discusses the accuracy problems arise from the white space 
       database access, and describes some solutions.
