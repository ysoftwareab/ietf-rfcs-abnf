   Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) Repository Requirements
              draft-sidrops-bruijnzeels-deprecate-rsync-00

Abstract

   This document updates the profile for the structure of the Resource
   Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) distributed repository [RFC6481] by
   describing how the RPKI Repository Delta Protocol (RRDP) [RFC8182]
   can be used, and stipulating that repositories which are made
   available over RRDP are no longer required to be available over
   rsync.

   The Profile for X.509 PKIX Resource Certificates [RFC6487] uses rsync
   URIs in the Authority Information Access, Subject Information Access,
   and CRL Distribution Points extensions.  This document leaves this
   unchanged, meaning that rsync URIs are still used for naming and
   finding objects in the RPKI.  However, it is no longer guaranteed
   that objects can be retrieved using these URIs.

1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Motivation

   The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) [RFC6480] as originally
   defined uses rsync as its distribution protocol, as outlined in
   [RFC6481].  Later, the RPKI Repository Delta Protocol (RRDP)
   [RFC8182] was designed to provide an alternative.  In order to
   facilitate incremental deployment RRDP has been deployed as an
   additional optional protocol, while rsync was still mandatory to
   implement.

   RPKI Repository operators are still required to provide 24/7 up-time
   to their rsync infrastructure, as long as the requirement to support
   rsync stands.  Thus, the benefit that they get from supporting RRDP,
   which enables the use of content delivery networks (CDNs) for this
   purpose, is limited.

   And as long as not all RPKI Repositories support RRDP, Relying Party
   software is still required to support rsync.  Because there is a lack
   of rsync client libraries, this is typically implemented by calling a
   system installed rsync binary.  This is inefficient, and has issues
   with regards to versioning of the rsync binary, as well as reporting
   errors reliably.

   This document requires that all RPKI repositories and all Relying
   Parties support RRDP.  It also stipulates that these parties are no
   longer required to support rsync.  This way all parties are freed of
   direct operational dependencies on rsync.

3.  Rsync URIs as object identifiers

   [RFC6481] defines a profile for the Resource Certificate Repository
   Structure.  In this profile objects are identified through rsync
   URIs.  E.g. a CA certificate has an Subject Information Access
   descriptor which uses an rsync URI to identify its manifest
   [RFC6486].  The manifest enumerates the relative names and hashes,
   for all objects published under the private key of the CA
   certificate.  This the full rsync URI identifiers for each object can
   be resolved relative to the manifest URI.

   Though it would be possible in principle to build up an RPKI tree
   hierarchy of objects based on key identifiers and hashes [RFC8488],
   most Relying Party implementations have found it very useful to use
   rsync URIs for this purpose.  Furthermore, these identifiers make it
   much easier to name object in case of validation problems, which help
   operators to address issues.

   For these reasons, RRDP still includes rsync URIs in the definition
   of the publish, update and withdraw elements in the snapshot and
   delta files that it uses.  See section 3.5 of [RFC8182].  Thus,
   objects retrieved through RRDP can be mapped easily to files and
   URIs, similar to as though rsync would have been used to retrieve
   them.

4.  Updates to RFC6481

   OLD:

   o  The publication repository SHOULD be hosted on a highly available
      service and high-capacity publication platform.

   o  The publication repository MUST be available using rsync [RFC5781]
      [RSYNC].  Support of additional retrieval mechanisms is the choice
      of the repository operator.  The supported retrieval mechanisms

      MUST be consistent with the accessMethod element value(s)
      specified in the SIA of the associated CA or EE certificate.

   NEW:

   o  The publication repository MUST be available using the RPKI
      Repository Delta Protocol [RFC8182].  The RRDP server SHOULD be
      hosted on a highly available platform.

   o  The publication repository MAY be available using rsync [RFC5781].

   o  Support of additional retrieval mechanisms is the choice of the
      repository operator.  The supported retrieval mechanisms MUST be
      consistent with the accessMethod element value(s) specified in the
      SIA of the associated CA or EE certificate.

5.  Deployment Considerations

   Relying Parties can drop support for rsync only when all RPKI
   repositories support RRDP.

   RPKI repositories can drop support for rsync only when Relying
   Parties support RRDP.  Even when all actively maintained RP software
   packages support RRDP, there will still be old versions of the
   software in operational use.  It is most likely impossible to find
   that all deployed software supports RRDP, but since RRDP SHOULD be
   used when it is available [section 3.4.1 of @!RFC8182] it will be
   possible to measure adoption.
