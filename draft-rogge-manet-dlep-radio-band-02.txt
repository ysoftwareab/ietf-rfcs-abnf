1.  Introduction

   The dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP) is defined in [RFC8175].
   It provides the exchange of link-related control information between
   DLEP peers.  DLEP peers are comprised of a modem and a router.  DLEP
   defines a base set of mechanisms as well as support for possible
   extensions.  This document defines one such extension.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Extension Usage and Identification

   The use of the Radio Band Extension SHOULD be configurable.  To
   indicate that the Radio Band Extension is to be used, an
   implementation MUST include the Radio Band Extension Type Value in
   the Extensions Supported Data Item.  The Extensions Supported Data
   Item is sent and processed according to [RFC8175].

   The Radio Band Extension Type Value is TBD; see Section TBD.

3.  Radio Band Data Item

   Radio Band Data Item contains information which radio frequency
   resources are being used.  These values are usually interface
   specific and static during the DLEP session.

   The Radio Band Data Item can be used multiple times to represent
   multiple radio bands.

   The Item can be used in a neighbor specific message if the radio use
   dedicated subcarriers to talk to neighbors.

   The format of the Radio Band Data Item is:

   0                   1                   2                   3

4.  Security Considerations

   The extension introduces a new Data Item for DLEP.  The extension
   does not inherently introduce any additional vulnerabilities above
   those documented in [RFC8175].  The approach taken to security in
   that document applies equally when running the extension defined in
   this document.

5.  IANA Considerations

   As described below, IANA has assigned two values per this document.
   Both assignments are to registries defined by [RFC8175].

5.1.  Extension Type Value

   IANA has assigned the following value in the "Extension Type Values"
   registry within the "Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP)
   Parameters" registry.  The new value is in the range with the
   "Specification Required" [RFC8126] policy:

                           +------+-------------+
                           | Code | Description |
                           +------+-------------+
                           | TBD  | Radio Band  |
                           +------+-------------+

                           Table 1: New Extension
                                 Type Value

5.2.  Data Item Value

   IANA has assigned the following value in the "Data Item Type Values"
   registry within the "Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP)
   Parameters" registry.  The new value is in the range with the
   "Specification Required" [RFC8126] policy:

                        +-----------+-------------+
                        | Type Code | Description |
                        +-----------+-------------+
                        | TBD       | Radio Band  |
                        +-----------+-------------+

                                   Value
