STATUS OF THIS MEMO

   This document is an Internet-Draft and is in full conformance with
   all provisions of Section 10 of RFC2026.

   Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering
   Task Force (IETF), its areas, and its working groups.  Note that
   other groups may also distribute working documents as Internet-
   Drafts.

   Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months
   and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any

Abstract

   This document defines a new SIP header field for communications
   resource priority, called "Resource-Priority". This header field
   influences the behavior of gateways and SIP proxies. It does not
   influence the forwarding behavior of IP routers.

2 Introduction

   This document defines a new SIP [2] header field for communications
   resource priority, called "Resource-Priority". This header MAY be

   used by GSTN gateways and SIP proxy servers to influence their
   treatment of SIP requests, including the priority afforded to GSTN
   calls. For GSTN gateways, the behavior translates into the ITU
   Recommendation Q.735.3 [3] prioritization mechanism, in both GSTN-
   to-IP and IP-to-GSTN directions. For IP networks, proxies may offer
   mechanisms beyond the scope of this document to influence, for
   example, admission control or IP packet marking.

   The Resource-Priority header field may be inserted by proxies and SIP
   user agents.

   The Resource-Priority header field may be used in several situations:

        1.   Requesting elevated priority for access to PSTN gateway
             resources such as trunk circuits.

        2.   Carrying information from one multi-level priority domain
             in the telephone network, e.g., using the facilities of
             Q.735.3 [3], to another, without the SIP proxies themselves
             inspecting the header field.

        3.   Indicating signaling priority in SIP proxies and back-to-
             back user agents, with higher priorities displacing
             existing signaling requests or bypassing PSTN gateway
             capacity limits in effect for lower priorities.

   This header is related to, but differs in semantics from, the
   Priority header field (RFC 2543, Section 6.25). The Priority header
   field describes the priority that the SIP request should have to the
   receiving human or its agent. For example, it may be factored into
   decisions about call routing and acceptance. It does not influence
   the use of communications resources such as packet forwarding
   priority in routers.

   The mechanism described here is only a small part of an emergency
   preparedness network.

   SIP entities supporting this specification MUST be able to generate
   and process this header.

3 The Resource-Priority Header Field

   This document defines the Resource-Priority general header field.



        Resource-Priority _  "Resource-Priority" HCOLON Resource-value
        Resource-value    _  namespace "." priority

Internet Draft             Resource Priority           December 28, 2001


        namespace         _  alphanum / "-"
        priority          _  alphanum / "-"


   The resource value is formatted as "namespace" "." "priority value".
   The name space and priority value are assigned by IANA (see IANA
   Considerations). An initial namespace, "dsn" (Defense Switched
   Network), contains the priority values, "critic-ecp", "flash-
   override", "flash", "immediate", "priority", "routine", where
   "flash-override" is the highest priority and "routine" is the lowest.
   [TBD: Should this just be registered by IANA rather than appear in
   the document?]

   As a response header, the value indicates the actual priority
   selected by the recipient. This priority value may be lower or higher
   than the request header value.

   If the header field is missing, the SIP request is treated as if it
   had the Resource-Priority value of "routine".

   The values are adopted from RFC 791 [4], omitting the levels "network
   control" and "internetwork control", as these are inappropriate here.

   The values are prioritized in the order "critic-ecp" (highest),
   "flash-override", "flash", "immediate", "priority" and "routine"
   (lowest). Additional values in the extension parameter are treated as
   "routine" by entities that do not understand the value.

   The value "critic-ecp" stands for "Critical and Emergency Call
   Processing" [4]. This value SHOULD only be used for authorized
   emergency communications, for example in the United States Government
   Emergency Telecommunications Service (GETS) [5], the United Kingdom
   Government Telephone Preference Scheme (GTPS) and similar government
   emergency preparedness or reactionary implementations elsewhere.

   _____________________________________________________________
   Resource-Priority    c     ar     -    -    -    o    -    -


   Proxies MAY downgrade the Resource-Priority of unauthenticated
   requests. Details are specific to each administrative domain and
   beyond the scope of this document. Proxies SHOULD NOT reject requests
   with such headers but instead downgrade the resource priority value.

   A proxy or user agent MAY return status code 503 (Service
   Unavailable) if there are insufficient resources at the resource
   priority level specified. The response MAY also include a Warning

   header with warning code 370 (Insufficient Bandwidth) if the request
   failed due to insufficient capacity for the media streams, rather
   than insufficient signaling capacity.

4 IANA Considerations

   Additional name spaces and priority values are registered with IANA.
   Within each namespace, The registration MUST indicate the relative
   precedence levels, expressed as an ordered list. Existing lists of
   priorities SHOULD NOT be extended. TBD: Any restrictions on new
   namespaces?

5 Security Considerations

   The Resource-Priority header field can be abused to consume scarce
   communications resources. Thus, authentication of the requester is of
   particular importance. Authentication MAY be SIP-based.
