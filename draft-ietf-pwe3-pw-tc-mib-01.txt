1  Abstract 
   
  This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management 
  Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in 
  the Internet community.  In particular, it describes the textual 
  conventions to be used in the various Pseudo Wire (PW) MIB modules.

2  Introduction 
   
  This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base 
  (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet 
  community. In particular, it defines Textual Conventions used in 
  IETF PW and PW-related MIBs. 
      
  Comments should be made directly to the MPLS mailing list at 
  pwe3@ietf.org.

4  The SNMP Management Framework  
    
  The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major 
  components: 
   
  o An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571]. 
   
  o Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the 
  purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of 
  Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD 
  16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC 1215 
  [RFC1215].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 
  58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 
  2580 [RFC2580]. 
   
  o Message protocols for transferring management information.  The 
  first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and 
  described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second version of the 
  SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track 
  protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [RFC1901] and 
  RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version of the message protocol is 
  called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [RFC1906], RFC 2572 
  [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574]. 
   
  o Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The 
  first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is 
  described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second set of protocol 
  operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 
  [RFC1905]. 
  o A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [RFC2573] 
  and the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575 
  [RFC2575]. 
   
  A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management 
  Framework can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570]. 
  Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, 
  termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB 
  are defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI. 
  This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A 
  MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate 
  translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically 
  equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no 
  translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable 
  information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in 
  SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of 
  machine readable information is not considered to change the 
  semantics of the MIB.

4.1  Object Definitions  
   
  Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, 
  termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB 
  are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One 
  (ASN.1) defined in the SMI. In particular, an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an 
  administratively assigned name, names each object type. The object 
  type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a 
  specific instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we 
  often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to also refer to 
  the object type.

  This memo defines textual conventions and object identities for use 
  in MPLS MIB modules. Security issues for these MIB modules are 
  addressed in the memos defining those modules.
