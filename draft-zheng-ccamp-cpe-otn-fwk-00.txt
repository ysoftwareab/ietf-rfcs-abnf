Abstract 
 
   The term Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) describes the terminals 
   that are associated with a carrier's telecommunication network. The 
   CPE provides access between a customer's devices and the network.  

   This document describes the framework for control of CPEs in optical 
   transport networks. Gap analysis is also included as guidance for 
   potential solutions such as protocol extensions.

1. Introduction 

   Carriers are providing leased line business-to-business (B2B) 
   services to their customers. These kinds of service have special 
   requests on bandwidth, latency, and other performance features. As 
   the leased line services start at the Customer Premises Equipment 
   (CPEs), the end-to-end (E2E) services need to be coordinated over 
   heterogeneous networks with the support of CPE control mechanisms. 

   The Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) techniques 
   [RFC3945] have been widely applied in metro and backbone network,

   providing effective deployment and efficient recovery mechanisms. A 
   detailed summary is provided in Section 4 of this document.  

   The YANG models specified by the IETF can also be applied to satisfy 
   the requirement of CPE control. The models' applicability is 
   analyzed in Section 5.  

   This document describes the framework for control of the CPE in 
   optical transport networks. Gap analysis is also included as 
   guidance for potential solutions such as protocol extensions.

       Figure 1: Architecture for OTN CPE Scenario 

   In the Figure 1, a two-domain example of OTN network is used with 
   CPE devices accessed to respective OTN domains. This architecture is 
   an extension of existing one with controller hierarchies. The dashed 
   line shows a logical of controller that directly controls the OTN 
   domain via DCN. More specifically, besides traditional NMS/EMS, 
   there is another CPE control/Management functional block in the 
   system, to accomplish the control function of CPE devices. This 
   logical system is further connected to carrier orchestration system.  

    

3. Requirement Analysis for CPE Control 

   In order to support the above scenarios, the following 
   functionalities need to be satisfied. 

     Interaction between CPE and NMS/EMS:  

     - Report and Query the basic information from the CPE;  

     - Configuration of CPE and OTN Access; 

     - Management of the Connections/CPEs; 

     Interaction between CPE and OTN Access:  

     - Discovery and mapping to the right OTN access;

Internet-Draft        CPE Control in OTN        October 2018 


     - Set up of connection between CPE and OTN via access protocol;  

   The above interactions are should be automatically processed rather 
   than manually. The main challenges are the limited resources 
   (storage/memory/computation) on the CPE are not as good as on core 
   nodes, so the solution may be different with core networks. If there 
   are potential different protocols for the CPE, the interworking 
   between the CPE and the core network would also need to be 
   investigated.  

4. GMPLS Applicability 

   GMPLS [RFC3945] is capable of three different kind of functionality: 
   discovery, routing, and signaling.  

   The Link Management Protocol (LMP) [RFC4204] runs between a pair of 
   physically or virtually adjacent nodes and is used to manage TE 
   links. In addition to setting up and maintaining control channels, 
   LMP can be used to discover and verify data link connectivity and to 
   correlate the properties of the link. LMP is also applicable to the 
   CPE scenario.  

   Routing protocols, especially OSPF-TE [RFC4203], have been extended 
   to provide link state capabilities for GMPLS. The same 
   characteristics may be used for CPE control.  

   In GMPLS, the signaling function is basically accomplished via RSVP-
   TE [RFC3473], with the definition of generalized label request and 
   label set.  

   Even if the current solution set is complete, it is challenging in 
   the CPE scenario to support all the functions with limited resources 
   on a simple CPE device. In order to support the automation of 
   control in CPE environments, it is necessary to specify a simplified 
   version of control protocols, to satisfy specific requirements in 
   CPE control.  

    

5. YANG Model Applicability 

   [RFC7895] describes a YANG library that provides information about 
   all the YANG modules used by a network management server. The 
   NETCONF protocol defined in [RFC6241] can be used to support these 
   YANG modules with the XML based data encoding.  

   [RFC7407] defines the usage of YANG data models for the 
   configuration of SNMP engines, which can also be applied for CPE 
   configuration. A set of YANG submodules that share the same

Internet-Draft        CPE Control in OTN        October 2018 


   namespace have been specified to add configuration support for SNMP 
   features. These submodules include a common session, together with 
   configurations to SNMP engine, target, notification, proxy, 
   community and so on. These functions are required in CPE control, 
   and these submodules can be applied in the system.  

   [RFC8343] defines a YANG data model for the management of network 
   interfaces, including the definitions for configuration and system 
   state (status information and counters for the collection of 
   statistics), satisfying the Network Management Datastore 
   Architecture (NMDA), as a fundamental model. A few interface-type-
   specific models augment to this model, to support the interface 
   management in tech-specific network scenarios, such as [RFC8344] for 
   IP interfaces and [draft-ietf-netmod-intf-ext-yang] for Ethernet.   

   Other functions have also been modeled in various other documents. 
   Routing functions and DHCP have also been supported in [RFC8349]. 
   [draft-ietf-ccamp-alarm-module] provides a module for alarm 
   management, [draft-ietf-netconf-ssh-client-server] and [draft-ietf-
   netconf-tls-client-server] specify the usage of communication 
   protocols. 

   Potential gaps in the current set of models for CPE control may 
   include performance monitoring and management, fault diagnosis and 
   management, configuration and collection on device port and so on. 
   These modules need to be covered in future documents for a complete 
   CPE control solution.

9. IANA Considerations
