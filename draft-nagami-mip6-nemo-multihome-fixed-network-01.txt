Abstract

    Multi-homing technology improves the availability of host and
    network connectivity. Since the node and network behavior of
    mobile networking and fixed networking are different, the
    different architecture has been discussed and proposed. This
    document proposes the common architecture both for mobile and
    fixed networking environment, using the mobile IP and NEMO. The
    proposed architecture only requires a modification of the mobile
    IP and NEMO so that multiple-CoA can be used. In addition,
    multiple HAs which are located in different place, are required
    for redundancy.

Internet-Draft        Multihoming for Fixed Network            July 2004


1. Motivation

    Users of small-scale network need to improve the network
    availability and to get load balance of several links by easy
    method. Multi-homing technology is one of solutions to improve the
    availability. Conventional major multi-homing network uses
    BGP. But it has some issues. Therefore, we propose a multi-homing
    architecture using the mobile IP and NEMO for small-scale fixed
    network.

1.1 General Benefits of Multi-homing

    In a multi-homing network environment, both users and network
    managers takes several benefits by controlling out-going traffic,
    in-comming traffic or both of them.  Those benefits are listed in
    the draft [GMUL] as the goals and benefits of multi-homing. The
    following is a summary of those goals and benefits listed in the
    draft.

     o Ubiquitous Access
     o Redundancy/Fault-Recovery
     o Load Sharing
     o Load Balancing
     o Bi-casting
     o Preference Settings


1.2 Problems to be Solved to Accomplish Multi-homing

     Several multi-homing technologies have been proposed so far.
     Conventional major multi-homing network uses BGP. But it has some
     issues as follows.

    (1) Increasing route entries in the Internet

       In the multi-homing environments, each user's network needs to
       advertise its address block to all ISPs connected to them. If
       multi-homed user connects only one ISP, the ISP can advertise
       routing information to aggregate them. But some multi-homed
       user needs to connect with different ISPs in preparation for
       failure of ISP. In this case, ISPs need to advertise routing
       information for multi-homed user without aggregation.
       Therefore, the number of routing entries in the Internet is
       increasing one by one.

    (2) Difficulty to efficiently use multiple links

       It is not easy to control in-coming traffics in the case of the
       conventional multi-homing architecture using BGP. Therefore,
       load balancing of connected links are difficult.

1.3 Using the Architecture of Mobile IP and NEMO to Solve the Problems

    Basically, the Mobile IP and the NEMO have been proposed for mobile
    host or mobile network, however the architecture and the protocol
    of them can be used for fixed networks. The following problems
    mentioned avobe can be solved by using the architecture and the
    protocol of them. The details of the solution is being described
    in the later section.

     o increasing route entries in the Internet
     o difficulty to efficient use multiple links

    Moreover, by using the architecture and the protocol of the MIP
    and the NEMO, a cost of network operation will be decreased.  For
    instance, in the architecture of the MIP and the NEMO, renumbering
    IP addresses when relocation of an office or network equipments
    becomes needless in consequence of that the network address prefix
    used in a user network in a Mobile IP environment is not depend on
    the upstream ISP's network prefix.

2. Multi-homing Architecture Using Mobile IP and NEMO

2.1 Mobile Network Includes Fixed Network

    NEMO and Mobile IP must work with multi-homing by its nature. This
    is because mobile nodes need to use multiple links for improving
    the availability of network connectivity since the wireless link
    is not always stable. Therefore, we propose that multihoming for
    fixed nodes (routers and hosts) use the framework of NEMO and
    Mobile IP.

2.2 Overview multi-homing network architecture using Mobile IP

    Figure 1 shows basic multi-homing network architecture. In this
    architecture, a mobile router (MR), which is boarder router of
    multi-homed network, sets up several tunnels between the MR and
    the HA by multiple-CoA registration. A HA or a router which the HA
    belongs advertise user's network prefix (Prefix X in Fig.1) to
    ISPs via routing protocol. If HA has several multi-homed network
    (Prefix X and Y in Fig.1), they can advertise an aggregated
    network prefix to ISPs. Therefore, the Internet routing entries do
    not increase one by one when multi-homed user is increased.

    Packets to multi-homed users go to HA and the HA sends packets to
    MR using CoA1 and CoA2. The HA selects a route which CoA is
    used. The route selection algorithm is out of scope of this
    document. This can improve availability of user network and
    control an in-coming traffic between ISP and MR. In the basic
    architecture, HA1 is single point of failure. In order to improve
    availability of user network, multiple HA is needed. This is
    described in later section.

3. Requirements for Mobile IP and NEMO

3.1 Multiple Care-of-Addresses (CoA)

    Multiple Care-of-Addresses needs to improve the availability and
    to control in coming and out going traffic. The current Mobile
    IPv6 and the NEMO Basic Support protocol does not allow to
    register more than one care-of address bound to a home address to
    the home agent. Therefore, [MCoA] is proposed to extend the MIP6
    and the NEMO Basic Support to allow multiple care-of address
    registrations for the particular Home Address.

3.2 Multiple Home Agents

    Multiple Home Agents should be geographically distributed across
    the Internet, for the improvement of service availability and for
    the load balancing of HA. When all the networks that have HA
    advertise the same network prefix to their adjacent
    router/network, the traffic is automatically routed to the nearest
    Home Agent from the view point of routing protocol topology. This
    operation has been already proven operational technology in the
    area of web server application, such as CDN (Contents Delivery
    Network), regarding IGP and EGP.

    In order to operate multiple HAs, all HAs must have the same
    information such as binding information. This is the
    synchronization of database among the HA.  The HAHA protocol
    [HAHA] introduces the binding synchornozation among HAs.  This is
    the same architecture as I-BGP.  The database is synchronized by
    full-mesh topology. In addition, in order to simplify operation of
    HA, the database is synchronized using star topology. This is
    analogy with I-BGP route reflector.

                               sync
                          HA1 <----> HA2
