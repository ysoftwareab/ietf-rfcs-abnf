1.  Introduction


2.  Terminology

2.1.  References

2.2.  BCP 14

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Purpose of this document

   "Static Context Header Compression (SCHC) and fragmentation for
   LPWAN, application to UDP/IPv6" [SCHC] defines a generic compression
   and fragmentation protocol that is optimized for LPWAN networks.

   SCHC needs to be instanciated to be applied to a particular
   networking technology.  This is being done at the LPWAN WG for
   [LoRaWAN], [Sigfox], and [NB-IOT].

   SCHC does not have to be limited to compression and fragmentation; it
   can be extended for other purposes, e.g., to transport commands and
   responses.  The necessary commands appear to be very similar across
   technologies and it makes sense to create a share IANA registry that
   is valid across technologies.  It does not mean that all technologies
   need to implement all the command and controls defined in the IANA
   registry that this document creates, either.

4.  Security Considerations

   This specification creates a registry.  There is no security
   consideration about the registry itself.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This specification creates a new Subregistry for the LPWAN command
   and control values for use within the [SCHC] protocol.

   *  Possible values are 8-bit unsigned integers (0..255).

   *  Registration procedure is "Standards Action" [RFC8126].

   *  Initial allocation is as indicated in Table 1:

                      +-------+---------+-----------+
                      | Value | Meaning | Reference |
                      +=======+=========+===========+
                      | 0     | Reset   | RFC THIS  |
                      +-------+---------+-----------+
                      | 1     | Ack     | RFC THIS  |
                      +-------+---------+-----------+
                      | 2     | Rekey   | RFC THIS  |
                      +-------+---------+-----------+
