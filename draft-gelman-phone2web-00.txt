1. Abstract

   This document presents a proposed search engine designed to link any
   10 digit telephone number to any webpage(s) associated with the
   telephone number. The search engine will be accessed via existing web
   browsers and Internet infrastructure, using IP addresses instead of
   domain names.

   To use this search engine, 10 digit telephone numbers will entered
   directly into the browser in a common format, in the place of a URL.                          Phone2Web Project               January 2000

2. Intended Purpose

   This search engine will provide webpage links for all webpages
   associated with any 10 digit telephone number in its databases.
   Users may type a telephone number into their web browser in one of
   these two formats: ###/###-####  or  ###/#######.  The browser will
   produce a webpage with all available links to webpage(s) associated
   with that telephone number.  If there are no associated webpages, an
   appropriate message will be presented.



3. Details of Operation

   When the user enters a telephone number, the actual area code (the
   first three digits) are recognized by the browser as the decimal
   equivalent of an IP address.  For example, if '800/239-5677' is
   entered, the '800' is recognized as IP address 0.0.3.32.

   Once queried, the search engine server will run a Perl script which
   will analyze the URL, access the appropriate database, and produces a
   webpage.



4. Special Requirements

   1) This project requires the use of IP addresses 0.0.0.200 through
   0.0.3.231.  These numbers correspond to possible area codes 200
   through 999.

   2) Routers must be set to allow routing of these IP numbers.



5. Cooperation with Other Projects

   This search engine will be available for use to other projects that
   integrate telephone and Internet technologies, with the requirement
   that they do not interfere with the functions described in sections 2
   and 3 in this draft.
