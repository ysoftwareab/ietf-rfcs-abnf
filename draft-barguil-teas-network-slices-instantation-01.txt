   Instantiation of IETF Network Slices in service providers networks
           draft-barguil-teas-network-slices-instantation-01

Abstract

   The IETF has produced several YANG data models to support the
   Software-Defined Networking and Network Slice Architecture.  This
   document describes the relationship between IETF Network Slice models
   utilized for requesting the IETF Network Slices and the Network
   Models (e.g.  L3NM, L2NM) used during their realizations.  This
   document describes the communication between the IETF Network Slice
   Controller and the network controllers for realization of IETF
   network slices.

   The IETF Network Slice YANG model provides the customer-oriented view
   of the network slice.  Thus, once the IETF Network Slice controller
   (NSC) receives a request, it needs to map it to accomplish the
   specific parameters expected by the network controllers.  The network
   models are analyzed in terms of how they can satisfy the IETF Network
   Slice requirements.  Identified gaps on existing models are reported.

Internet-Draft   Network models for IETF Network Slices        July 2021


1.  Introduction

   The IETF has produced several YANG data models to support the
   Software-Defined Networking and Network Slice Architecture.  This
   document describes the relationship between the IETF Network Slice
   models utilized for requesting the IETF Network Slices and the
   Network Models (e.g.  L3NM, L2NM) used during their realizations.
   This document describes the communication between the IETF Network
   Slice Controller and the network controllers for realization of IETF
   network slices.

   The IETF Network Slice YANG service model provides the customer-
   oriented view of the network slice.  Once the IETF Network Slice
   controller (NSC)receives a request, it needs to map it to accomplish
   the specific parameters expected by the network controller.  The
   network models are analyzed in terms of how they can satisfy the IETF
   Network Slice requirements.  Identified gaps on existing models are
   reported.

   Editor's Note: the terminology in this draft will be aligned with the
   final terminology selected for describing the notion of IETF Network
   Slice when applied to IETF technologies, which is currently under
   discussion.  By now same terminology as used in
   [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slice-definition] and
   [I-D.nsdt-teas-ns-framework] is primarily used here.  Consensus to
   use "IETF Network Slice" term has been reached.

1.1.  Terminology

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Reference architecture

   As described in [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slice-definition], the
   IETF Network Slice Controller (NSC) is a functional entity for
   control and management of IETF network slices.  As shown in Figure A,
   NSC from its Norht Bound Interface (NBI exposes set of APIs that
   allow a higher level system to request an IETF network slice.  The
   NSC NBI supports the request for enablement of an IETF Network Slice
   (i.e., creation, modification or deletion).  Upon receiving a request
   from its NBI, NSC finds the resources needed for realization of the
   IETF Network Slice and in turn interfaces from its South Bound
   Interface (SBI) with one or more Network Controllers for the
   realization of the requested IETF Network Slice.

   be implemented in operator's network.

   Figure 1 Network Slice Controller as a module of the Hierarchical SDN
   controller.

   Several architectural definitions have arisen on the IETF to support
   SDN and network slicing deployments.  The architectural proposal
   defined in [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slice-definition] includes a
   three-level hierarchy and expresses how each level relates with the
   ACTN architecture framework.

   Figure 2 defines depicts a possible architecture using those
   concepts.  It starts from a top consumer or high-level operational
   systems.  Next, the IETF Network Slice Controller function migth be
   part of the Hierarchical network controller (e.g., as the MDSC in the
   ACTN context [RFC8453]) as a modular function.  At the bottom, two
   network controllers, each one can handle multiple or single underlay
   technologies.

   In other implementations, the IETF Network Slice Controller can be a
   stand-alone element and directly interact with the network
   controller, as depicted in Figure 2.  In this scenario, the services
   request follows a data-enrichment path, where each entity adds more
   information to the service request.  This document describes how the
   available service models and network models interact to deliver the
   network slices in a service provider environment.

   As another implementation possibility, the IETF Network Slice

Internet-Draft   Network models for IETF Network Slices        July 2021


   To accomplish those requirements, a set of YANG data models have been
   proposed.  Those Yang models, summarized in table xx, could be used
   by an IETF Network Slice Controller to manage CRUD operations on the
   IETF Network Slice.  That is, these models aim capturing the
   requirements from the consumer of the slice point of view and avoid
   entering into the detail of how the slice is actually created.

   *  [draft-wd-teas-ietf-network-slice-nbi-yang]: A Yang Data Model for
      IETF Network Slice NBI.

   *  [draft-liu-teas-transport-network-slice-yang]: Transport Network
      Slice YANG Data Model.

4.  Yang Models for Network Controllers

   As a functional entity responsible for managing a network domain, the
   network controller, can expose its northbound interface based on YANG
   models.  The IETF Network Slice Controller can use the network
   controller's NBI during the realization of IETF Network Slice.  The
   following network models can be used for realization of IETF Network
   slices:

   *  LxVPN Network models:

      -  These models describe a VPN service from the network point of
         view.  It supports the creation of Layer 3 and Layer 2 services
         using several control planes.

   *  Traffic Engineering models:

      -  These models allow to manipulate Traffic Engineering tunnels
         within the network segment.  Technology-specific extensions
         allow to work with a desired technology (e.g.  MPLS RSVP-TE
         tunnels, Segment Routing paths, OTN tunnels, etc.)

   *  TE Service Mapping extensions:

      -  These extensions allow to specify for LxVPN the details of an
         underlay based on TE.

   *  ACLs and routing policies models:

      -  Even though ACLs and routing policies are device models, it's
         exposure in the NBI of a domain controller allows to provide an
         additional granularity that the network domain controller is
         not able to infer on its own.

4.1.  LxVPN Network Models

   The framework defined in [RFC8969] compiles a set of YANG data models
   for automating network services.  The data models can be used during
   the service and network management life cycle (e.g., service
   instantiation, service provisioning, service optimization, service
   monitoring, service diagnosing, and service assurance).  The so
   called Network models could be reused for the realization of Network
   slice requests.

   The following models are examples of Network models that describe
   services.

   *  [I-D.ietf-opsawg-l3sm-l3nm]: A Layer 3 VPN Network YANG Model

   *  [I-D.ietf-opsawg-l2nm]: A Layer 2 VPN Network YANG Model

4.2.  Traffic Engineering Models

   TEAS has defined a collection of models to allow the management of
   Traffic Engineering tunnels.

   *  [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te]: A YANG Data Model for Traffic Engineering
      Tunnels, Label Switched Paths and Interfaces.  The model allows to
      instantiate paths in a TE enabled network.  Note that technology
      augmented models are require to particular per-technology
      instantiations.

4.3.  Traffic Engineering Service Mapping

   The IETF has defined a YANG model to set up the procedure to map VPN
   service/network models to the TE models.  This model, known as
   service mapping, allows the network controller to assign/retrieve
   transport resources allocated to specific services.  At the moment
   there is just one service mapping model
   [I-D.ietf-teas-te-service-mapping-yang].  The "Traffic Engineering
   (TE) and Service Mapping Yang Model" augments the VPN service and
   network models.

5.  Compliance of Network Controller models with IETF Network Slice
    Requirements.

   Section 3 presented the requirements of the IETF Network slices.
   This section analyses how YANG models used by a Network Controller
   can satisfy those requirements and identifies the potencial gaps.

5.1.  Availability

   As per [draft-ietf-teas-te-service-mapping-yang], Availability is a
   probabilistic measure of the length of time that a VPN/VN instance
   functions without a network failure.  As per RFC 8330, The parameter
   "availability", as described in [G.827], [F.1703], and [P.530], is
   often used to describe the link capacity.  The availability is a time
   scale, representing a proportion of the operating time that the
   requested bandwidth is ensured".

   The calculation of the availability is not trivial and would need to
   be clearly scoped to avoid misunderstandings.

   The set of Yang models proposed today allow to request tunnels/paths
   with different resiliency requirements in terms of protection and
   restoration.  However, none of them include the possibility of
   requesting a specific availability (e.g. 99.9999%).

5.2.  Downlink throughput / Uplink throughput.

   The LxVPN Models ([I-D.ietf-opsawg-l3sm-l3nm] and
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-l2nm]) allow to specify the bandwdidth at the
   interface level between the slice and the customer.  In addition, the
   Service Mapping model [draft-ietf-teas-te-service-mapping-yang]
   allows to bind a VPN to a given LSP, which have its bandwidth
   requirements.  Additionally, TE models can force a give bandwidth in
   the connection between Provider Edges.

   Previous comment applies to the incoming and outgoing bandwidth
   parameters required for the NFV-based services use case in
   [I-D.contreras-teas-slice-nbi].  The Network sharing use case has
   Maximum and Guaranteed Bit Rate parameters.  These parameters can be
   mapped to the TE tunnel models when setting up LSPs [draft-ietf-teas-
   yang-te].

5.3.  Protection scheme

   Protection schemes are mechanisms to define how to setup resources
   for a given connection.  TE tunnel models [draft-ietf-teas-yang-te]
   includes protection and restoration as two main attributes.  The
   parameters included in the containers for protection and restoration
   cover the requirements of the IETF NS related with protection
   schemes.  Similarly, TE models cover the parameter 'recovery time'
   for the network sharing use case.

Internet-Draft   Network models for IETF Network Slices        July 2021


5.4.  Delay

   Delay is a critical parameter for several IETF NS types.  Every use-
   case defined in [I-D.contreras-teas-slice-nbi] contains delay
   constraints. 5G use cases require 'delay tolerance', NFV-based
   services have the delay information within 'QoS metrics' and 'Bounded
   latency' in the network sharing use case.

   During the realization of the IETF Network Slice, these parameters
   are part of the requirements of a TE tunnel configuration [draft-
   ietf-teas-yang-te].  They can be included within the 'path-metric-
   bounds' parameter, so the created LSP fulfils the given metrics
   bounds like 'path-metric-delay-average' or 'path-metric-delay-
   minimum'.

5.5.  Packet loss rate

   The packet loss rate indicates the maximum rate for lost packets that
   the service tolerates in the link.  During the realization of the
   IETF Network Slice, this attribute will influence the tunnel
   selection and the value is included in the [draft-ietf-teas-yang-te]
   document as the 'path-metric-loss".  The 'path-metric-loss' is a
   metric type, which measures the percentage of packet loss of all
   links traversed by a P2P path.  This parameter is required for 5G
   services and network sharing use-case, while it is part of the 'QoS
   metrics' for the NFV-based services.

6.  Interactions

   Draft [draft-contreras-teas-slice-controller-models] shows the
   internal structure of an IETF Network Slice Controller which can be
   divided into two components:

   *  IETF Network Slice Mapper: this high-level component processes the
      customer request, putting it into the context of the overall IETF
      Network Slices in the network.

   *  IETF Network Slice Realizer: this high-level component processes
      the complete view of transport slices including the one requested
      by the customer, decides the proper technologies for realizing the
      IETF Network Slice and triggers its realization.

   The details of IETF network slice mapper and realize are provided
   below for various implementation of NCS.

6.1.  IETF Network Slice requested to Hierarchical Network Controller

   Referring to Figure 1 in an integrated architecture, the IETF Network
   Slice Controller (NCS) is part of a Hierarchical SDN controller
   module, the NSC's and the Hierarchical Network Controller should
   share the same internal data and the same NBI.  Thus, the H-SDN
   module must be able to:

   *  Map: The customer request received using the [draft-wd-teas-ietf-
      network-slice-nbi-yang] must be processed by the NCS.  The mapping
      process takes the network-slice SLAs selected by the customer to
      available Routing Policies and Forwarding policies.

Internet-Draft   Network models for IETF Network Slices        July 2021


   *  Realize: Create necessary network requests.  The slice's
      realization can be translated into one or several LXNM Network
      requests, depending on the number of underlay controllers.  Thus,
      the NCS must have a complete view of the network to map the orders
      and distribute them across domains.  The realization should
      include the expansion/selection of Forwarding Policies, Routing
      Policies, VPN policies, and Underlay transport preference.

   To maintain the data coherence between the control layers, the IETF
   Network Slice ID "ns-id" used of the [draft-wd-teas-ietf-network-
   slice-nbi-yang] must be directly mapped to the "transport-instance-
   id" at the VPN-Node level.

6.2.  IETF Network Slice requested to Network Slice Controller

   Referring to Figure 2 when the Network Slice Controller is a stand-
   alone controller module, the NSC's should perform the same two tasks
   described in section 6.1:

   *  Map: Process the customer request.  The customer request can be
      sent using the [draft-liu-teas-transport-network-slice-yang].
      This draft allows the topology mapping of the Slice request.

   *  Realize: Create necessary network requests.  The slice's
      realization will be translated into one LXNM Network request.  As
      the NCS has a topological view of the network, the realization can
      include the customer's traffic engineering transport preferences
      and policies.

6.3.  Network Slice Controller as part of the domain controller

   The Network Slice Controller can be a module of the Network
   controller.  In that case, two options are available.  One is to
   share the same device data model in the NBI and SBI of the SDN
   controller.  The direct translation would reduce the service logic
   implemented at the SDN controller level, grouping the mapping and
   translation into a single task:

   *  Realize: As the device models are part of the network controller's
      NBI thus, the realization can be done by the network controller
      applying a simple service logic to send the Network elements.

   A second option introduces a more complex logic in the network
   controller and creates an abstraction layer to process the transport
   slices.  In that case, the controller should receive network slices
   creation requests and maintain the whole set of implemented slices:

   *  Map & Realize: The mapping and realization can be done by the
      Domain controller applying the service logic to create policies
      directly on the Network elements.

7.  Security Considerations

   There are two main aspects to consider.  On the one hand, the IETF
   Network Slice has a set of security related requirements, such as
   hard isolation of the slice, or encryption of the communications
   through the slice.  All those requirements need to be analyzed in
   detailed and clearly mapped to the Network Controller and device
   interfaces.

   On the other hand, the communication between the IETF network slicer
   and the network controller (or controllers or hierarchy of
   controllers) need to follow the same security considerations as with
   the network models.

   The network YANG modules defines schemas for data that is designed to
   be accessed via network management protocols such as NETCONF
   [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer is the
   secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8466].  The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM)
   [RFC8341] provides the means to restrict access for particular
   NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available
   NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   The following summarizes the foreseen risks of using the Network
   Models to instantiate IETF network Slices:

   *  Malicious clients attempting to delete or modify VPN services that
      implements an IETF network slice.  The malicious client could
      manipulate security related aspects of the network configuration
      that impact the requirements of the slice, failing to satisfy the
      customer requirement.

   *  Unauthorized clients attempting to create/modify/delete a VPN hat
      implements an IETF network slice service.

   *  Unauthorized clients attempting to read VPN services related
      information hat implements an IETF network slice

   *  Malicious clients attempting to leak traffic of the slice.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document is informational and does not require IANA allocations.

9.  Conclusions

   A wide variety of yang models are currently under definition in IETF
   that can be used by Network Controllers to instantiate IETF network
   slices.  Some of the IETF slice requirements can be satisfied by
   multiple means, as there are multiple choices available.  However,
   other requirements are still not covered by the existing models.  A
   more detailed definition of those uncovered requirements would be
   needed.  Finally a consensus on the set of models to be exposed by
   Network Controllers would facilitate the deployment of IETF network
   slices.
