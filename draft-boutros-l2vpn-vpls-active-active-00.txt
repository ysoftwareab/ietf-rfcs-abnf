INTERNET DRAFT      VPLS Active/Active Multi-homing    February 28, 2011


1  Introduction

   VPLS currently supports multi-homing with active/standby redundancy,
   for e.g. as discussed in draft-ietf-l2vpn-vpls-multihoming. While
   this redundancy model is sufficient for certain deployments, there
   are evolving network applications that require support for
   active/active redundancy with per flow load-balancing. VPLS support
   for active/active multi-homing is applicable only when the access
   network Layer 2 redundancy mechanism supports it. For example mLACP,
   as defined in [ICCP], can support active/active redundancy. It is
   worth noting that active/active multi-homing can be achieved using a
   virtual switch solution, and that approach has its own set of
   advantages and drawbacks that are outside the scope of this document.
   Consider the simple network topology that follows:


      +-----PE1 +--------+
    CE1         |  VPLS  | PE3 -- CE3
      +-----PE2 +--------+

   CE1 is dual homed to PE1 and PE2. PE1, PE2 and PE3 are connected to
   the same VPLS instance with a full mesh of PWs. If both of the ACs
   connecting CE1 to PE1 and PE2 are active, the following issues would
   arise in the network, if it were running current VPLS: 1- Unknown
   unicast, multicast and broadcast traffic originating from CE1 on the
   active AC towards PE1 may be looped back to CE1 from PE2 on the other
   active AC. 2- Unknown unicast, multicast and broadcast traffic
   originating from CE3 and flooded by PE3, would arrive to PE1 and PE2,
   and duplicate packets will be delivered to CE1. 3- Traffic with a
   particular source MAC address (M1) originating from CE1 towards the
   core, and load-balanced to both PE1 and PE2, will cause MAC address
   table instability on PE3. The latter will see M1 flip-flopping
   between the 2 PWs originating from PE1 and PE2, respectively. This
   document describes a flexible multi-homing solution with all-active
   ACs using VPLS data-path extensions. In the sections that follow, we
   will describe: (1) The VPLS data-path forwarding extensions to
   support all-active multi-homing. (2) The mechanism to achieve optimum
   forwarding for both unicast and multicast flows between single-homed
   and multi-homed sites connected to the same VPLS domain. (3) The
   mechanism to achieve fast convergence on port, link or node failures.
   (4) The requirements for the control plane signaling extensions as
   they apply to the VPLS signaling procedures defined in [rfc4761] and
   [rfc4762]. (5) The DF election mechanism requirements for eliminating
   frame duplication in the case of flooded multi-destination traffic.
   (6) The support of E-TREE service restrictions The fundamental idea
   behind this proposal is as follows: when a PE (PEr) receives a frame
   from the MPLS backbone, it needs to know 1) from which source site it
   is coming (this is known as SSID, the source site ID. Each site has a

   unique site ID) and the 'cast status of the frame' (whether the
   source PE (PEs) sent the frame to one single PE or to several PE's).
   Once this information is available, the receiving PEr can:- ensure to
   not send the frame back into the source site (PEr filters any local
   AC which has the same SSID as the source site)- if the frame needs to
   be flooded, decide whether the frame can be flooded on a local multi-
   homed AC (if the cast status is unicast, yes it can be flooded; if
   the cast status is flooded, then PEr can only flood on the local MH
   AC if PEr is DF for that MH AC). The encoding of these two pieces of
   information within a packet is performed with an additional upstream
   label pushed after the classical VPLS PW label. A source PE signals
   (BGP or LDP) such upstream label beforehand and binds two pieces of
   semantics to each upstream label: the SSID of the source site and the
   cast status of the frame. At minimum, two upstream labels are
   required per connected site at a PE: one for each cast status. If a
   specific deployment uses P2M LSP for flooding multicast, broadcast
   and unknown unicast, then the cast status can be derived from the top
   label (p2p PW vs P2M LSP) and one single upstream label is required
   per PE per site.

3  Active-Active Extensions to VPLS
3.1 SSID

   A site connected to a PE is either singled-home (SH) (one single AC
   between that site and any PE of the VPLS domain) or multi-homed (MH)
   (multiple AC's between that site and multiple PE's). A MH site has a
   globally unique site ID. A SH site has a unique site ID in the
   context of the PE advertising it. When a PE advertises connectivity
   to a site, it indicates the site nature (SH or MH), its site ID, two
   upstream labels bound to the site and the VPLS instances associated
   with the site. A PE connected to 5 SH sites can either advertise one
   single SH site route for all the 5 SH sites or advertise 5 individual
   SH site routes. At least 2 upstream labels are required to identify
   the site: one upstream label is used for known unicast traffic
   originating from the site (the PE which sent the frame sent it to one
   single remote PE), and another upstream label is used for multi-
   destination traffic from the site (the PE which sent the frame sent
   it to multiple remote PE's either via ingress replication or P2MP
   LSP). The use of different upstream labels will be described in more
   details in sections below. We call 'Cast status' whether the source
   PE unicast the frame to one single PE or to multiple remote PE's.
   This is an important piece of information to let a remote PE
   connected to a multi-homed site know whether it should flood the
   packet to the multi-homed site or not. MH-Site labels are withdrawn
   by a PE when the site gets disconnected from the PE, e.g. due to link
   failures.

3.2 Modified VPLS Label Stack

   When a PE connected to a MH-Site floods traffic originating from that
   site over a P2MP LSP, it MUST use the following label stack:

   1- Using a P2MP aggregate inclusive tree:

 


Boutros et al.         Expires September 1, 2011                [Page 7]

INTERNET DRAFT      VPLS Active/Active Multi-homing    February 28, 2011


   [P2MP Label]          [Identify Source PE]
   [VSI Label]           [Identify VPLS instance]
   [Source site Label]   [Identify SH/MH site, Cast Status]

   2- Using a P2MP inclusive tree:

   [P2MP Label]          [Identify Source PE]
   [Source site Label]   [Identify SH/MH site, cast status]

   The source site label is the upstream label advertised by the PE
   connected to the site and corresponding to the advertised MH-ID or
   SH-ID. When a PE connected to a MH-Site forwards unicast traffic
   originating from that site over a P2P PW, it MUST use the following
   label stack:

   [PW Label]         [Identify Source PE + and VPLS instance]
   [Source site Label][Identify SH/MH site, cast stat]

   The source site label is the upstream label advertised by the PE
   connected to the site and corresponding to the advertised MH-ID or
   SH-ID. The same label stack can be used to flood multi-destination
   traffic originating from the MH-Site, using P2P PWs, in case of
   ingress replication.

3.3 Forwarding Rules - Active/Active

3.3.1 A frame is received from a local AC

   The PE associates a SSID with the packet (the SSID of the source AC).
   The PE performs a MAC lookup in the VPLS instance associated with the
   source AC.
   A. a match is found
   A.1 the match is a local AC
       The behavior is the same as when a packet is received from the
   core and a MAC lookup gives a match on a local AC. See later section
   C.
   A.2 the match is a remote SHID
       The packet is sent to the remote PE. The label encapsulation is
   as described in section 3.1 (specifically, the upstream label
   identifies the source site ID and the cast status as unicast)
   A.3 the match is a remote MHID
        A hash is computed on L2/L3/L4 flow-defining fields and a single
   PE connected to the remote MHID site is selected. The packet is sent
   to this remote PE with the label stack as described in section 3.1
   (specifically, the upstream label identifies the source site ID and
   the cast status as unicast)
   B. No match is found
   The packet is flooded on local ACs and all the remote PEs within the
 


Boutros et al.         Expires September 1, 2011                [Page 8]

INTERNET DRAFT      VPLS Active/Active Multi-homing    February 28, 2011


   VPLS instance. Some specific filtering is required for flooding on
   local ACs. This behavior is similar to the one performed when a
   packet is received from the MPLS backbone and the MAC lookup gives no
   match. See section D for specific details. The label encapsulation
   for packets flooded to remote PEs is as described in section 3.1
   (specifically, the upstream label identifies the source site ID and
   the cast status as flooded).

3.3.2 A packet is received from the backbone

   When a packet P is received from the backbone, the receiving PE (PEr)
   will determine the four following pieces of information: from which
   remote site ID the packet is coming, what is the cast status of
   packet P and what is its VPLS instance.

   PEr first learns that the SMAC of packet P is reachable via the
   source site ID (learning is done to a site ID, not to a PE). If the
   source site is MH, then the SMAC is in fact learned against a load-
   balancing data-structure of 2 or more PEs.

   Second PEr performs a MAC destination address lookup in the VPLS
   instance.

   C. A match is found on a local AC
   - PEr forwards on the local AC only if [the site ID of the local AC
   is <> from the source site ID]

   D. No match is found
   The packet is flooded on all local AC's which meet ALL the following
   properties:
   - The local AC site ID is <> from the source site ID
   - If P's cast status is flooded, then PEr can flood on a local AC 
        part of a multi-homed site if PEr is the DF for that MH site

   Note: in case D, note that if the cast status of the packet is
   unicast, then P should be flooded on all local MH AC's whether PEr is
   DF or not. Indeed, the packet was unicast to PEr by the source PE and
   hence there is no need to apply DF filtering to avoid duplication
   between several PEs connected to the same MH site. Note: Core split
   horizon rule MUST be enforced as per classic VPLS: a frame received
   from PW cannot be flooded back onto PWs

3.3.3 EIBGP Multipath Behavior

   When a frame is received from a local AC, and the MAC lookup gives a
   match on a MHID site which has a local AC and a remote PE, this
   revision specifies that the local AC should be preferred. A later
   revision might support the load-balancing of traffic between the
 


Boutros et al.         Expires September 1, 2011                [Page 9]

INTERNET DRAFT      VPLS Active/Active Multi-homing    February 28, 2011


   local path and the remote path. Such a behavior is commonly known as
   EIBGP multipath in L3VPN.

3.3.4 Active Standby 

   The only difference occurs in step A3. No hashing is required: the
   packet is always sent to the primary PE within the load-balancing
   structure. Note: In Active/Standby mode, the standby PE MAY configure
   the blocking behavior in both directions for the MH-Site.

3.3.5 MH Site label usage

   When a PE PEr advertises a label L bound to a local MHID, the local  
   and remote PEs will install the label differently in their forwarding
   table. PEr, the local PE, will install L as a downstream label. Any
   packet received with this label is cross-connected (a la VPWS) onto
   an AC leading to the MHID site. This forwarding entry is key to
   deliver sub-50msec protection upon AC failure (see later). A remote
   PEt installs L in a context table indexed by 'PEr'. More
   specifically, when PEt receives a frame from PEr, a first label will
   identify 'PEr', the source PE and then the next label will be L. PEt
   will look up L into the context table related to PEr and will deduce
   what is the source MHID of the packet and what is the cast status of
   the packet.

3.3.6 MAC Learning Logic Extensions

   MAC learning for packet coming from the backbone is performed against
   the source site ID. In the case of a MH source site ID, this is very
   important as the MAC address is learned to the MHID and hence traffic
   later sent to this MAC address can be load-balanced to all the PEs
   connected to that MHID site. In the case of a SH source site ID, as a
   single PE is connected to such site, the MAC learning is in fact
   similar to classic VPLS.

3.3.7 MAC Flush Logic Extensions

   When one of the SH site ACs goes down, existing mechanisms for MAC
   flush for the VPLS instances associated with this AC MUST be used.
   Allocating a distinct SSID to each SH AC allows a PE to limit the
   flush to the minimum set of impacted MAC addresses. When a PE
   attached to the MH site goes down, remote PEs MUST remove the failed
   PE from the ECMP of PWs associated with the MH Site with no MAC
   flushing. When the AC attached to a MH-Site goes down, the PE MUST
   send a withdrawal for the MH Site ID and associated label. Remote PEs
   MUST then remove the PE from the ECMP of PWs associated with the MH
   Site without MAC flushing. MAC entries learnt via MH site on a given
   VPLS instance must be flushed only when all PEs withdraw their

INTERNET DRAFT      VPLS Active/Active Multi-homing    February 28, 2011


   advertisements for that MH Site.


4 Fast convergence 
4.1 PE Node Failure

   When a PE attached to a MH site goes down, remote PEs can detect the
   PE failure using existing fast detection mechanisms and update their
   load-balancing structure for the MHID site by removing the failed
   PE's PW from the load-balancing path-list.

4.2 AC Failure

   Two PEs PE1 and PE2 are connected to the same MH site S with
   respective ACs AC1 and AC2. PE1 advertises a label L bound to site S
   hence PE1 cross-connects any packet received with label L onto AC1 (a
   la VPWS). PE2 pre-computes and pre-installs a backup structure for
   AC2: any traffic that should be sent on AC2, would be backed up on an
   LSP to PE1 with an extra label L being pushed. Upon AC2 failure, this
   backup structure is immediately enabled and the traffic is rerouted
   to PE1 which reroutes it onto AC1 and hence towards the resilient
   site S.

5 Policy

   Detailed procedures on support of forwarding policies, such as those
   mandated by E-TREE service will be described in the next revision of
   this document.

6 Control Plane Signaling Extension Requirements

   Each PE MUST signal (1) a MH-ID advertisement for each MH site it is
   connected to and a set of one or more associated upstream label(s) to
   identify the MH site, (2) an SH-ID advertisement (0) for all single
   homed sites it is connected to and a set of one or more associated
   upstream non null label(s) and (3) the list of VPLS instances
   associated with the MH and SH site advertisements. The upstream
   labels that identify the source SH or MH site are used to distinguish
   whether the traffic is being unicast or flooded over the core. This
   is to allow the disposition PE to decide whether it needs to enforce
   the AC split-horizon and DF filtering.

7 Eliminating Duplicate Frames: DF Election Requirement

   Designated Forwarder (DF) election is needed to eliminate duplicates
   for flooded traffic coming from core to the MH site. Only the PE that
   is elected as the DF MUST forward the flooded traffic.

   The mechanisms of DF election are outside the scope of this document.

   1. Packet with src MAC M2 arrives at PE2.
   2. PE2 encap packet with SH Site upstream label (Unicast packet).
   3. PE2 matches M1 behind MHID1. It hashes and picks PE1. PE2 sends the packet over PW to PE10 with upstream label identifying SHID at PE2 and cast status=unicast. 
   4. PE10 receives packet over PE2 PW, does mac learning against SHID at PE2 (basically PE2).
   5. Once PE10 detects AC10 failure, it sends packet to PE1 encaping the packet with the PE1 advertised upstream label (unicast) for MH Site-1.
   6. PE1 receives packet and PE1 pop the label, and sends packet to AC1 with no mac learning.
   7. PE10 sends a withdraw for the MH Site1 route to all PEs, all PEs would remove the PE10 PW from the ECMP.
