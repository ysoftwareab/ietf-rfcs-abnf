1 Introduction

   This document defines the use of multimedia protocols and the set up
   of multimedia sessions in the Secure Internet Live Conferencing (SILC)
   protocol [SILC1].  The SILC protocol supports multimedia messages
   with the Message Payload [SILC2] and SILC_MESSAGE_FLAG_DATA which
   has the ability to define what type of content is delievered within
   the payload.  The Message Payload is used to encapsulate the multimedia
   session set up procedure and the actual multimedia session data.  We
   define the recommended multimedia session protocol for SILC and also
   consider some other protocols in the scope of SILC.


1.1 Requirements Terminology

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED,
   MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this document, are to be
   interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2 Recommended Protocol

   Since SILC protocol can encapsulate practically any protocol for setting
   up a multimedia session we have selected the Session Description Protocol
   (SDP) as RECOMMENDED protocol.  It was chosen for its maturity, simplicity
   and versatility.  If multimedia features are implemented in SILC
   application it is recommended that at least support for SDP is added.


3 Session Description Protocol (SDP)

   The SDP [SDP] protocol defines a general purpose multimedia session
   description protocol.  SDP is one of the simplest protocols to negotiate
   multimedia sessions and is suited perfectly for SILC protocol.  Since SDP
   does not itself define how it is used to set up the session, we define it
   here for SILC.  The definition is based on the [RFC3264] and [RFC4145].

   In SILC the SDP messages are sent as data messages (MIME message).  They
   can be destined directly to a client for direct conferencing, or to a
   channel for group conferencing.  It is also possible to send the message
   directly to client to invite them to group conferencing before they have
   joined the channel.  The MIME type used is application/sdp.

Internet-Draft                                           15 January 2007


   To set up a multimedia session a client sends SILC message with
   SILC_MESSAGE_FLAG_DATA and SILC_MESSAGE_FLAG_REQUEST flags set and with
   MIME SDP message in the message payload.  If the receiver wants to
   participate in the multimedia session it sends MIME SDP message back with
   SILC_MESSAGE_FLAG_DATA and SILC_MESSAGE_FLAG_REPLY flags set to the
   sender.  If reply is not received after an application defined period of
   time the message may be retransmitted or the session set up may be
   terminated.

   After reply has been received the multimedia session is started according
   to the SDP and all multimedia data is sent using SILC data messages.  When
   performing peer-to-peer connection the SDP defines which party initiates
   the connection.  After initiation the SILC Key Exchange protocol MUST be
   performed.  The resulted key material will be used to protect the multimedia
   session.  Multimedia data transmission may start after the key exchange
   has been performed.  When performing group conferencing all parties
   independently connect to the SILC server specified in the SDP.  In other
   cases when performing the multimedia session inside the SILC network, any
   party may start transmitting the multimedia data after the SDPs have been
   exchanged.

   To terminate the session, or to reject incoming request, an MD5 digest
   MUST be computed from the original SDP data, and the digest is sent back
   with the SILC_MESSAGE_FLAG_DATA and SILC_MESSAGE_FLAG_STOP flags set.
   The receiver of such message should verify the MD5 digest and terminate
   the session if it matches any active session.  The session may also be
   terminated by closing network connection.  In group sessions simply by
   leaving the channel terminates the session.  The original sender of the
   SDP message may send the terminating message to notify all clients on the
   channel to terminate the session.  If the original sender on channel
   receives the terminating message it takes no action on it.

3.1 SDP field usage in SILC

   The Encryption Keys (k=) field describes encryption key to protect the
   multimedia session.  As SILC protocol transport and the multimedia session
   is secured by default this field SHOULD NOT be used.


   The Origin (o=) field describes from where the session originates.  The
   <username> sub-field is the sender's SILC nickname.  Examples:

        o=foobar 2890844521 2890842804 IN IP4 10.2.1.7


   The Connection Data (c=) field describes the connection information for
   the multimedia session.  When performing peer-to-peer multimedia session
   the <network type> is 'IN', indicating Internet connection.  When

Internet-Draft                                           15 January 2007


   performing multimedia session inside SILC network it is 'SILC'.  When
   the 'SILC' network type is used the <address type> and <connection address>
   sub-fields are omitted.  Examples:

        c=SILC
        c=IN IP4 10.2.1.7


   The Media Announcements (m=) field describes the media information for the
   multimedia session.  If the network type in c= field is 'SILC' the <port>
   sub-field MUST be set to 9 (discard).  The <transport> for RTP over UDP
   is 'RTP/AVP', for RTP over TCP it is 'TCP/RTP/AVP', and for non-RTP protocol
   over UDP it is 'udp' and over TCP it is 'tcp'.  The <fmt> sub-field
   includes the RTP media payload number when using RTP.  When using non-RTP
   protocol it includes MIME subtype.  Examples:

        c=SILC
        m=audio 9 TCP/RTP/AVP 3
        a=rtpmap:3 GSM/8000

        c=SILC
        m=audio 9 tcp mpeg


   The Attributes (a=) field can be used to set various session and media
   specific attributes.  For SILC we define attribute "silc".

        a=silc:<session type> <parameters>

   The <session type> is either "direct" or "group".  When it is "direct"
   and the c= field defines a connection point the connection will be
   peer-to-peer connection to the remote client.  If it is "group" and the
   the c= field defines a connection point the connection will be to a remote
   SILC server for group conferencing.  If c= field includes "SILC" network
   type, then "direct" is for direct session with a client in SILC network
   and "group" is for group conferencing in SILC network.  If the "silc"
   attribute is omitted the session type is expected to be "direct".  The
   following parameters are defined for attribute "silc".

        channel        The name of the channel for group conferencing.
                           Can be used only with "group" session type.
                           More than one channel parameters may be defined.


   The [RFC4145] specifies a "setup" attribute that defines which party of the
   session will initiate the connection when performing peer-to-peer session.
   Its use in SILC is as specified in [RFC4145] and MUST be present in SDP
   when the c= field includes an actual connection point and when the "silc"

Internet-Draft                                           15 January 2007


   attribute session type is "direct", or if the attribute is not present at
   all.  When performing group conferencing each party always need to create
   the connection to the server and the "setup" attribute need not be present
   in SDP.

3.2 SDP Examples

        v=0
        o=foobar 2890844521 2890842804 IN IP4 10.2.1.100
        s=peer-to-peer example
        t=0 0
        m=audio 5000 TCP/RTP/AVP 3
        c=IN IP4 10.2.1.100
        a=rtpmap:3 GSM/8000
        a=silc:direct
        a=setup:active

   This example sets up a peer-to-peer session to remote client at
   10.2.1.100 at port 5000.

        v=0
        o=foobar 2890844521 2890842804 IN IP4 10.2.1.32
        s=Group conferencing example
        c=IN IP4 10.2.1.7
        t=0 0
        a=silc:group channel=foobar
        m=audio 706 TCP/RTP/AVP 3
        a=rtpmap:3 GSM/8000

   This example sets up a session to a remote SILC server 10.2.1.7 at port
   706.  Once connected the channel "foobar" will be joined for group
   conferencing.

        v=0
        o=foobar 2890844521 2890842804 IN IP4 10.2.1.32
        s=SILC network chat example
        c=SILC
        t=0 0
        m=audio 9 TCP/RTP/AVP 3
        a=rtpmap:3 GSM/8000

   This example sets up a session inside SILC network with the remote user
   "foobar".

        v=0
        o=foobar 2890844521 2890842804 IN IP4 10.2.1.32
        s=SILC network group conferencing example
        t=0 0

Internet-Draft                                           15 January 2007


        m=audio 9 TCP/RTP/AVP 3
        c=SILC
        a=rtpmap:3 GSM/8000
        a=silc:group channel=group-chat

   This example sets up a group conferencing session inside SILC network on
   channel "group-chat".


4 Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)

   The SIP [SIP] protocol is a general purpose protocol for setting up,
   modifying and terminating different kinds of sessions, including
   multimedia sessions.  The SIP protocol use the SDP to describe the
   multimedia session.

   In SILC the SIP messages are sent as data messages (MIME message).  They
   can be destined directly to a client for direct conferencing, or to a
   channel for group conferencing.  It is also possible to send the message
   directly to client to invite them to group conferencing before they have
   joined the channel.  The MIME type used is application/sip.  The
   SILC_MESSAGE_FLAG_DATA flag must be set in each message and the message
   payload includes a MIME SIP message.  The actual SIP session set up and
   termination is described in the SIP protocol specification, and SILC
   protocol merely provides a secure transport for the session.  After the
   session is set up all multimedia data is sent using SILC data messages.
   The MIME type for the multimedia data messages is defined during the SIP
   session set up.

   The rules for SDP fields described in previous section also applies for
   SDP with SIP in the context of SILC.

   Proxy and redirection servers usually would not be used in the context of
   SILC, unless the sessions are redirected to outside SILC network.  This
   may compromise the security of the session.

   The S/MIME need not be used when using SIP in SILC protocol.  The SILC
   protocol transport and the created multimedia session is secured by
   default.


5 Other Protocols

   There are other open and proprietary protocols for setting up multimedia
   sessions.  One important is H.323 using the H.225 to set up the session.
   This document should later define the use of H.323 with SILC.
   Practically any protocol to set up multimedia sessions may be used with
   SILC by using SILC as a secure transport to set up the session, and to use

Internet-Draft                                           15 January 2007


   SILC data messages (MIME messages) to secure and deliver the actual
   multimedia data once the session has been established.


6 Security Considerations

   Security is central to the design of this protocol, and these security
   considerations permeate the specification.  Common security considerations
   such as keeping private keys truly private and using adequate lengths for
   symmetric and asymmetric keys must be followed in order to maintain the
   security of this protocol.
