1.  Introduction

   In 2013, after a great deal of community discussion, the decision was
   made to shift from the plain text, ASCII-only canonical format to XML
   [XML-ANNOUNCE].  The high-level requirements for the format of RFCs
   were defined in RFC Series Format Requirements and Future Development
   [RFC6949].  Several different publication formats will be rendered
   from that canonical XML, including HTML, PDF, TXT, and EPUB.

   The Unicode Consortium defines 'plain text' as "Computer-encoded text
   that consists only of a sequence of code points from a given
   standard, with no other formatting or structural information.  Plain
   text interchange is commonly used between computer systems that do
   not share higher-level protocols." [unicode-glossary]

   While a plain text output for RFCs will continue to be required for
   the foreseeable future, the details of what that means for RFCs in
   terms of which character encoding may be used, what the page layout
   will look like, how to handle figures and artwork, and pagination are
   documented in this draft.

   The following assumptions drive the changes in the plain text output
   for RFCs:

   o  The existing tools to create the text file are extremely
      sensitive; manual manipulation is required in the final output.
      In particular, handling page breaks for text is tricky.

   o  Additional publication formats--for example: PDF, HTML-- will be
      available that will offer features such as markup, pretty
      printing, etc.

   o  There is an extensive tool chain in existence among the community
      to work with plain text documents.  Similar functionality may be
      possible with other publication formats, but the workflow that
      uses the existing tool chain must be supported as much as is
      considered practical.

2.  Character Encoding

   The use of non-ASCII characters will be allowed in a limited and
   controlled fashion.  The details regarding the guidance for how to
   include non-ASCII characters is under development and documented in
   The Use of Non-ASCII Characters in RFCs [I-D.flanagan-nonascii].
   Please view the PDF version of that draft.

   The character encoding for all plain text documents will be UTF-8
   [RFC3629].  The file will include a byte order mark (BOM) to provide
   text reader software with in-band information about the character
   encoding scheme used.

3.  Figures and Artwork

   Authors may continue to include figures drawn with ASCII characters.
   If the canonical format includes figures or artwork other than ASCII-
   art, then the plain text output must include a pointer to the HTML
   version of the RFC to allow readers to see the relevant artwork.

   Authors who wish to include ASCII-art for the plain text file and SVG
   art for the other outputs may do so, but they should be aware of the
   potential for confusion to individuals reading the RFC with two
   unique diagrams describing the same content.

   ASCII art will have a character width limit of no more than 85
   characters.

4.  Page Layout

   Arguments both in favor of and against pagination have been offered
   by members of the community and summarized in RFC 6949.  After
   further discussion, two plain text outputs will be created during the
   publication process - one with basic pagination that includes a form
   feed instruction every 58 lines at most, depending on the text and
   artwork layout, and a second with no pagination at all.  This will
   allow for both easier cut and paste from the plain text file,
   uninterupted diff output, better understanding when you can't tell if

   a page break is also a paragraph break, and a better printing
   experience for those working with the plain text output .

   Line lengths for both text and artwork, will increase to 80
   characters in order to take advantage of wider screens and
   unnecessarily wide page margins.

4.1.  Headers and Footers

   The front matter on the front page (such as the RFC number and
   category), and the back matter on the last page (the author's full
   names and contact information) will continue with the structure
   described in RFC 5741 [RFC5741], "RFC Streams, Headers, and
   Boilerplates".  Given the removal of the pagination requirement,
   running headers and footers will no longer exist.

4.2.  Table of Contents

   Given the removal of the pagination requirement, the Table of
   Contents will list section and subsection numbers and titles, but
   will not include page numbers.
