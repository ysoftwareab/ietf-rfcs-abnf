                         The WebSocket protocol
                  draft-abarth-websocket-handshake-01

Abstract

   The WebSocket protocol enables two-way communication between a user
   agent running untrusted code running in a controlled environment to a
   remote host that has opted-in to communications from that code.  The
   security model used for this is the Origin-based security model
   commonly used by Web browsers.  The protocol consists of an initial
   handshake followed by basic message framing, layered over TCP.  The
   goal of this technology is to provide a mechanism for browser-based
   applications that need two-way communication with servers that does
   not rely on opening multiple HTTP connections (e.g. using
   XMLHttpRequest or <iframe>s and long polling).

   Please send feedback to the hybi@ietf.org mailing list.

1.  Opening Handshake

1.1.  Client Requirements

   User agents running in controlled environments, e.g. browsers on
   mobile handsets tied to specific carriers, may offload the management
   of the connection to another agent on the network.  In such a
   situation, the user agent for the purposes of conformance is
   considered to include both the handset software and any such agents.

   When the user agent is to *establish a WebSocket connection* to a
   host /host/, on a port /port/, from an origin whose ASCII
   serialization is /origin/, with a flag /secure/, with a string giving
   a /resource name/, with a (possibly empty) list of strings giving the
   /protocols/, and optionally with a /defer cookies/ flag, it must run
   the following steps.  [ORIGIN]

   1.   Verify that the WebSocket URL and its components are valid
        according to ???.  If any of the requirements are not met, the
        client MUST fail the WebSocket connection and abort these steps.

   2.   If the user agent already has a WebSocket connection to the
        remote host (IP address) identified by /host/, even if known by
        another name, wait until that connection has been established or
        for that connection to have failed.  If multiple connections to
        the same IP address are attempted simultaneously, the user agent
        must serialize them so that there is no more than one connection
        at a time running through the following steps.

        If the user agent cannot determine the IP address of the remote
        host (for example because all communication is being done
        through a proxy server that performs DNS queries itself), then
        the user agent must assume for the purposes of this step that
        each host name refers to a distinct remote host, but should
        instead limit the total number of simultaneous connections that
        are not established to a reasonably low number (e.g., in a Web
        browser, to the number of tabs the user has open).

        NOTE: This makes it harder for a script to perform a denial of
        service attack by just opening a large number of WebSocket
        connections to a remote host.  A server can further reduce the
        load on itself when attacked by making use of this by pausing
        before closing the connection, as that will reduce the rate at
        which the client reconnects.

        NOTE: There is no limit to the number of established WebSocket
        connections a user agent can have with a single remote host.
        Servers can refuse to connect users with an excessive number of

        connections, or disconnect resource-hogging users when suffering
        high load.

   3.   _Connect_: If the user agent is configured to use a proxy when
        using the WebSocket protocol to connect to host /host/ and/or
        port /port/, then connect to that proxy and ask it to open a TCP
        connection to the host given by /host/ and the port given by
        /port/.

           EXAMPLE: For example, if the user agent uses an HTTP proxy
           for all traffic, then if it was to try to connect to port 80
           on server example.com, it might send the following lines to
           the proxy server:


              CONNECT example.com:80 HTTP/1.1
              Host: example.com

           If there was a password, the connection might look like:


              CONNECT example.com:80 HTTP/1.1
              Host: example.com
              Proxy-authorization: Basic ZWRuYW1vZGU6bm9jYXBlcyE=

        Otherwise, if the user agent is not configured to use a proxy,
        then open a TCP connection to the host given by /host/ and the
        port given by /port/.

        NOTE: Implementations that do not expose explicit UI for
        selecting a proxy for WebSocket connections separate from other
        proxies are encouraged to use a SOCKS proxy for WebSocket
        connections, if available, or failing that, to prefer the proxy
        configured for HTTPS connections over the proxy configured for
        HTTP connections.

        For the purpose of proxy autoconfiguration scripts, the URL to
        pass the function must be constructed from /host/, /port/,
        /resource name/, and the /secure/ flag using the steps to
        construct a WebSocket URL.

        NOTE: The WebSocket protocol can be identified in proxy
        autoconfiguration scripts from the scheme ("ws:" for unencrypted
        connections and "wss:" for encrypted connections).

   4.   If the connection could not be opened, then fail the WebSocket
        connection and abort these steps.

   5.   If /secure/ is true, perform a TLS handshake over the
        connection.  If this fails (e.g. the server's certificate could
        not be verified), then fail the WebSocket connection and abort
        these steps.  Otherwise, all further communication on this
        channel must run through the encrypted tunnel.  [RFC2246]

        User agents must use the Server Name Indication extension in the
        TLS handshake.  [RFC4366]

   6.   Let the client-nonce be a 16 byte sequence chosen uniformly at
        random.

   7.   Send the following strings (in order):

        1.  Send the UTF-8 string "CONNECT websocket.invalid:443
            HTTP/1.1".

        2.  Send a UTF-8-encoded U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN U+000A LINE FEED
            character pair (CRLF).

        3.  Send the UTF-8 string "Host: websocket.invalid:443".

        4.  Send a UTF-8-encoded U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN U+000A LINE FEED
            character pair (CRLF).

        5.  Send the UTF-8 string "Sec-WebSocket-Key: ".

        6.  Send the client-nonce encoded in base64.

        7.  Send a UTF-8-encoded U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN U+000A LINE FEED
            character pair (CRLF).

        8.  Send the UTF-8 string "Sec-WebSocket-Metadata: ".

   8.   Let /hostport/ be an empty string.

   9.   Append the /host/ value, converted to ASCII lowercase, to
        /hostport/.

   10.  If /secure/ is false, and /port/ is not 80, or if /secure/ is
        true, and /port/ is not 443, then append a U+003A COLON
        character (:) followed by the value of /port/, expressed as a
        base-ten integer, to /hostport/.

   11.  Let the metadata-dictionary be the following dictionary:

        1.  Key "resource_name" maps to value /resource name/.

        2.  Key "host" maps to value /host/.

        3.  Key "origin" maps to value /origin/.

        4.  Key "protocols" maps to the array containing each protocol
            in /protocols/.

        5.  If the client has any cookies that would be relevant to a
            resource accessed over HTTP, if /secure/ is false, or HTTPS,
            if it is true, on host /host/, port /port/, with /resource
            name/ as the path (and possibly query parameters), then key
            "cookie" maps to the cookie-string for that resource
            (including http-only cookies).[RFC2616][RFC2109][RFC2965]

   12.  Let the metadata-string be the JSON serialization of the
        metadata-dictionary in UTF-8.

   13.  Let the handshake-mask be the HMAC-SHA1 of the UTF-8 string
        "C1BA787A-0556-49F3-B6AE-32E5376F992B" keyed with the client-
        nonce.

   14.  Let the masked-metadata be a sequence of bytes where the /i/th
        byte is the XOR of the /i/th byte of the metadata-string with
        the /i mod 20/th byte of the handshake-mask.

   15.  Send the following strings (in order):

        1.  Send the masked metadata encoded in base64.

        2.  Send a UTF-8-encoded U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN U+000A LINE FEED
            character pair (CRLF).

        3.  Send a UTF-8-encoded U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN U+000A LINE FEED
            character pair (CRLF).

   16.  Read bytes from the server until either the connection closes or
        until 17 bytes are read.  If the read bytes are not exactly the
        UTF-8 string "HTTP/1.1 200 OK" followed by a UTF-8-encoded
        U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN U+000A LINE FEED character pair (CRLF),
        then _fail the WebSocket connection_ and abort these steps.

        User agents may apply a timeout to this step, failing the
        WebSocket connection if the server does not send back data in a
        suitable time period.

   17.  Let /fields/ be a list of name-value pairs, initially empty.

   18.  _Field_: Let /name/ and /value/ be empty byte arrays.

   19.  Read bytes from the server.

        If the connection closes before this byte is received, then fail
        the WebSocket connection and abort these steps.

        Otherwise, handle the byte as described in the appropriate entry
        below:

        -> If the byte is 0x0D (UTF-8 CR)
           If the /name/ byte array is empty, then jump to the fields
           processing step.  Otherwise, fail the WebSocket connection
           and abort these steps.

        -> If the byte is 0x0A (UTF-8 LF)
           Fail the WebSocket connection and abort these steps.

        -> If the byte is 0x3A (UTF-8 :)
           Move on to the next step.

        -> If the byte is in the range 0x41 to 0x5A (UTF-8 A-Z)
           Append a byte whose value is the byte's value plus 0x20 to
           the /name/ byte array and redo this step for the next byte.

        -> Otherwise
           Append the byte to the /name/ byte array and redo this step
           for the next byte.

        NOTE: This reads a field name, terminated by a colon, converting
        upper-case letters in the range A-Z to lowercase, and aborting
        if a stray CR or LF is found.

   20.  Let /count/ equal 0.

        NOTE: This is used in the next step to skip past a space
        character after the colon, if necessary.

   21.  Read a byte from the server and increment /count/ by 1.

        If the connection closes before this byte is received, then fail
        the WebSocket connection and abort these steps.

        Otherwise, handle the byte as described in the appropriate entry
        below:

        -> If the byte is 0x20 (UTF-8 space) and /count/ equals 1
           Ignore the byte and redo this step for the next byte.

        -> If the byte is 0x0D (UTF-8 CR)
           Move on to the next step.

        -> If the byte is 0x0A (UTF-8 LF)
           Fail the WebSocket connection and abort these steps.

        -> Otherwise
           Append the byte to the /value/ byte array and redo this step
           for the next byte.

        NOTE: This reads a field value, terminated by a CRLF, skipping
        past a single space after the colon if there is one.

   22.  Read a byte from the server.

        If the connection closes before this byte is received, or if the
        byte is not a 0x0A byte (UTF-8 LF), then fail the WebSocket
        connection and abort these steps.

        NOTE: This skips past the LF byte of the CRLF after the field.

   23.  Append an entry to the /fields/ list that has the name given by
        the string obtained by interpreting the /name/ byte array as a
        UTF-8 byte stream and the value given by the string obtained by
        interpreting the /value/ byte array as a UTF-8 byte stream.

   24.  Return to the "Field" step above.

   25.  _Fields processing_: Read a byte from the server.

        If the connection closes before this byte is received, or if the
        byte is not a 0x0A byte (UTF-8 LF), then fail the WebSocket
        connection and abort these steps.

        NOTE: This skips past the LF byte of the CRLF after the blank
        line after the fields.

   26.  Let the /list of cookies/ be empty.

   27.  If there is not exactly one entry in the /fields/ list whose
        name is "sec-websocket-accept", or if there is not exactly one
        entry in the /fields/ list whose name is "sec-websocket-key", or
        if there is not exactly one entry in the /fields/ list whose
        name is "sec-websocket-origin", or if there is not exactly one
        entry in the /fields/ list whose name is "sec-websocket-

        exactly one entry in the /fields/ list whose name is "sec-
        websocket-protocol", or if there are any entries in the /fields/
        list whose names are the empty string, then fail the WebSocket
        connection and abort these steps.  Otherwise, handle each entry
        in the /fields/ list as follows:

        -> If the entry's name is "sec-websocket-accept"
           If the value is not exactly equal to the base64 encoding of
           the HMAC-SHA1 of the UTF-8 string "258EAFA5-E914-47DA-95CA-
           C5AB0DC85B11" keyed with the client-nonce, then _fail the
           WebSocket connection_ and abort these steps.

        -> If the entry's name is "sec-websocket-key"
           If the read bytes are not the base64 encoding of a 16 byte
           sequence, then _fail the WebSocket connection_ and abort
           these steps.  Otherwise, let the server-nonce be that 16 byte
           sequence.  If the server-nonce is identical to the client-
           nonce, then _fail the WebSocket connection_ and abort these
           steps.

        -> If the entry's name is "sec-websocket-origin"
           If the value is not exactly equal to /origin/, then fail the
           WebSocket connection and abort these steps.  [ORIGIN]

        -> If the entry's name is "sec-websocket-location"
           If the value is not exactly equal to a string obtained from
           the steps to construct a WebSocket URL from /host/, /port/,
           /resource name/, and the /secure/ flag, then fail the
           WebSocket connection and abort these steps.

        -> If the entry's name is "sec-websocket-protocol"
           If there was a /protocols/ string specified, and the value is
           not exactly equal to one of the items in /protocols/, then
           fail the WebSocket connection and abort these steps.  (If no
           /protocols/ was specified, the field is ignored.)

        -> If the entry's name is "set-cookie" or "set-cookie2" or
        another cookie-related field name
           If the relevant specification is supported by the user agent,
           add the cookie, interpreted as defined by the appropriate
           specification, to the /list of cookies/, with the resource
           being the one with the host /host/, the port /port/, the path
           (and possibly query parameters) /resource name/, and the
           scheme |http| if /secure/ is false and |https| if /secure/ is
           true.  [RFC2109] [RFC2965]

           agent, then the field must be ignored.

           The cookies added to the /list of cookies/ are discarded if
           the connection fails to be established.  Only if and when the
           connection is established do the cookies actually get
           applied.

        -> Any other name
           Ignore it.


   28.  If the /defer cookies/ flag is not set, apply the cookies in the
        /list of cookies/.

   29.  The *WebSocket connection is established*.  Now the user agent
        must send and receive to and from the connection as described in
        the next section.  The handshake has established two keys:

        *  The client-to-server-mask is the intial 16 bytes of the HMAC-
           SHA1 of the UTF-8 string "363A6078-74D2-4C0B-8CBC-
           1E6A36E83442" keyed with the concatenation of the client-
           nonce and the server-nonce.

        *  The server-to-client-mask is the initial 16 bytes of the
           HMAC-SHA1 of the UTF-8 string "2306C3BE-0ACF-42C0-B69E-
           DFFE02CFA346" keyed with the concatentation of the client-
           nonce and the server-nonce.

        All subsequent bytes sent from the user agent to the server are
        masked as follows:

        3.  The /i/th byte is XORed with the /i mod 20/th byte of the
            client-to-server-mask.

        All subsequence bytes read by the user agent from the server are
        unmasked as follows:

        4.  The /i/th byte is XORed with the /i mod 20/th byte of the
            server-to-client-mask.

   30.  If the /defer cookies/ flag is set, store the /list of cookies/
        for use by the component that invoked this algorithm.

   Where the algorithm above requires that a user agent fail the
   WebSocket connection, the user agent may first read an arbitrary
   number of further bytes from the connection (and then discard them)
   before actually *failing the WebSocket connection*.  Similarly, if a
   user agent can show that the bytes read from the connection so far

   are such that there is no subsequent sequence of bytes that the
   server can send that would not result in the user agent being
   required to *fail the WebSocket connection*, the user agent may
   immediately *fail the WebSocket connection* without waiting for those
   bytes.

   NOTE: The previous paragraph is intended to make it conforming for
   user agents to implement the algorithm in subtlely different ways
   that are equivalent in all ways except that they terminate the
   connection at earlier or later points.  For example, it enables an
   implementation to buffer the entire handshake response before
   checking it, or to verify each field as it is received rather than
   collecting all the fields and then checking them as a block.

   When the user agent is to "apply the cookies" in a /list of cookies/,
   it must handle each cookie in the /list of cookies/ as defined by the
   appropriate specification.  [RFC2109] [RFC2965]

1.2.  Server-side requirements

   _This section only applies to servers._

   Servers may offload the management of the connection to other agents
   on the network, for example load balancers and reverse proxies.  In
   such a situation, the server for the purposes of conformance is
   considered to include all parts of the server-side infrastructure
   from the first device to terminate the TCP connection all the way to
   the server that processes requests and sends responses.

   EXAMPLE: For example, a data center might have a server that responds
   to Web Socket requests with an appropriate handshake, and then passes
   the connection to another server to actually process the data frames.
   For the purposes of this specification, the "server" is the
   combination of both computers.

1.2.1.  Reading the client's opening handshake

   When a client starts a WebSocket connection, it sends its part of the
   opening handshake.  The server must parse at least part of this
   handshake in order to obtain the necessary information to generate
   the server part of the handshake.

   The client handshake consists of the following parts.  If the server,
   while reading the handshake, finds that the client did not send a
   handshake that matches the description below, the server should abort
   the WebSocket connection.

   1.  The UTF-8 string "CONNECT websocket.invalid:443 HTTP/1.1".

   2.  A UTF-8-encoded U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN U+000A LINE FEED character
       pair (CRLF).

   3.  The UTF-8 string "Host: websocket.invalid:443".

   4.  A UTF-8-encoded U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN U+000A LINE FEED character
       pair (CRLF).

   5.  The UTF-8 string "Sec-WebSocket-Key: ".

   6.  A string of base64 encoded bytes terminated by a UTF-8-encoded
       U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN U+000A LINE FEED character pair (CRLF).
       The decoded bytes are the client-nonce.

   7.  The UTF-8 string "Sec-WebSocket-Metadata: ".

   8.  A string of base64 encoded bytes terminated by a UTF-8-encoded
       U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN U+000A LINE FEED character pair (CRLF).
       The decoded bytes are the masked-metadata.

   Let the handshake-mask be the HMAC-SHA1 of the UTF-8 string
   "C1BA787A-0556-49F3-B6AE-32E5376F992B" keyed with the client-nonce.

   Let the metadata-string be the masked-metadata unmasked by XORing the
   /i/th byte of the masked-metadata with the /i mod 20/th byte of the
   handshake-mask.

   Let the metadata-dictionary by the result of parsing the metadata-
   string as a UTF-8 encoded JSON string.

   The expected dictionary keys, and the meaning of their corresponding
   values, are as follows.

   |host|
      The value gives the hostname that the client intended to use when
      opening the WebSocket.  It would be of interest in particular to
      virtual hosting environments, where one server might serve
      multiple hosts, and might therefore want to return different data.

      Can be safely ignored, though the server should abort the
      WebSocket connection if this field is absent or has a value that
      does not match the server's host name, to avoid vulnerability to
      cross-protocol attacks and DNS rebinding attacks.

Internet-Draft           The WebSocket protocol            November 2010


   |origin|
      The value gives the scheme, hostname, and port (if it's not the
      default port for the given scheme) of the page that asked the
      client to open the WebSocket.  It would be interesting if the
      server's operator had deals with operators of other sites, since
      the server could then decide how to respond (or indeed, _whether_
      to respond) based on which site was requesting a connection.
      [ORIGIN]

      Can be safely ignored, though the server should abort the
      WebSocket connection if this field is absent or has a value that
      does not match one of the origins the server is expecting to
      communicate with, to avoid vulnerability to cross-protocol attacks
      and cross-site scripting attacks.

   |protocols|
      The value gives an array of the subprotocols that the client is
      intending to select.  It would be interesting if the server
      supports multiple protocols or protocol versions.

      Can be safely ignored, though the server may abort the WebSocket
      connection if the field is absent but the conventions for
      communicating with the server are such that the field is expected;
      and the server should abort the WebSocket connection if the field
      has a value that does not match one of the subprotocols that the
      server supports, to avoid integrity errors once the connection is
      established.

   Other keys
      Other fields can be used, such as "cookie", for authentication
      purposes.  Their semantics are equivalent to the semantics of the
      HTTP headers with the same names.

   Unrecognized fields can be safely ignored, and are probably either
   the result of clients that support future versions of the protocol
   offering options that the server doesn't support.

1.2.2.  Sending the server's opening handshake

   When a client establishes a WebSocket connection to a server, the
   server must run the following steps.

   1.  If the server supports encryption, perform a TLS handshake over
       the connection.  If this fails (e.g. the client indicated a host
       name in the extended client hello "server_name" extension that
       the server does not host), then close the connection; otherwise,
       all further communication for the connection (including the
       server handshake) must run through the encrypted tunnel.

       [RFC2246]

   2.  Establish the following information:

       /host/
          The host name or IP address of the WebSocket server, as it is
          to be addressed by clients.  The host name must be punycode-
          encoded if necessary.  If the server can respond to requests
          to multiple hosts (e.g. in a virtual hosting environment),
          then the value should be derived from the client's handshake,
          specifically from the "Host" field.  The /host/ value must be
          lowercase (not containing characters in the range U+0041 LATIN
          CAPITAL LETTER A to U+005A LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Z).

       /port/
          The port number on which the server expected and/or received
          the connection.

       /resource name/
          An identifier for the service provided by the server.  If the
          server provides multiple services, then the value should be
          derived from the resource name given in the client's
          handshake.

       /secure flag/


          True if the connection is encrypted or if the server expected
          it to be encrypted; false otherwise.

       /origin/
          The ASCII serialization of the origin that the server is
          willing to communicate with, converted to ASCII lowercase.  If
          the server can respond to requests from multiple origins (or
          indeed, all origins), then the value should be derived from
          the client's handshake, specifically from the "Origin" field.
          [ORIGIN]

       /subprotocol/
          Either null, or a string representing the subprotocol the
          server is ready to use.  If the server supports multiple
          subprotocols, then the value should be derived from the
          client's handshake, specifically by selecting one of the
          values from the "protocols" array.  The absence of such a
          field is equivalent to the null value.  The empty string is
          not the same as the null value for these purposes.

   3.  Let /location/ be the string that results from constructing a
       WebSocket URL from /host/, /port/, /resource name/, and /secure
       flag/.

   4.  Let acceptance-proof be the base64 encoding of the HMAC-SHA1 of
       the UTF-8 string "258EAFA5-E914-47DA-95CA-C5AB0DC85B11" keyed
       with the client-nonce.

   5.  Let server-nonce be a sequence of 16 bytes chosen uniformly at
       random.

   6.  Send the following line, terminated by the two characters U+000D
       CARRIAGE RETURN and U+000A LINE FEED (CRLF) and encoded as UTF-8,
       to the client:

           HTTP/1.1 200 OK

   7.  Send the following fields to the client.  Each field must be sent
       as a line consisting of the field name, which must be an ASCII
       case-insensitive match for the field name in the list below,
       followed by a U+003A COLON character (:) and a U+0020 SPACE
       character, followed by the field value as specified in the list
       below, followed by the two characters U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN and
       U+000A LINE FEED (CRLF).  The lines must be encoded as UTF-8.
       The lines may be sent in any order.

       |Sec-WebSocket-Accept|
          The value must be the acceptance-proof.

       |Sec-WebSocket-Key|
          The value must be the server-nonce encoded in base64.

       |Sec-WebSocket-Location|
          The value must be /location/

       |Sec-WebSocket-Origin|
          The value must be /origin/

       |Sec-WebSocket-Protocol|
          This field must be included if /subprotocol/ is not null, and
          must not be included if /subprotocol/ is null.

          If included, the value must be /subprotocol/

       Optionally, include "Set-Cookie", "Set-Cookie2", or other cookie-
       related fields, with values equal to the values that would be
       used for the identically named HTTP headers.  [RFC2109] [RFC2965]

   8.  Send two bytes 0x0D 0x0A (UTF-8 CRLF).

   9.  Send /response/.

   This completes the server's handshake.  If the server finishes these
   steps without aborting the WebSocket connection, and if the client
   does not then fail the WebSocket connection, then the connection is
   established and the server may begin sending and receiving data, as
   described in the next section.  The handshake has established two
   keys:

   o  The client-to-server-mask is the HMAC-SHA1 of the UTF-8 string
      "363A6078-74D2-4C0B-8CBC-1E6A36E83442" keyed with the
      concatenation of the client-nonce and the server-nonce.

   o  The server-to-client-mask is the HMAC-SHA1 of the UTF-8 string
      "2306C3BE-0ACF-42C0-B69E-DFFE02CFA346" keyed with the
      concatentation of the client-nonce and the server-nonce.

   All subsequent bytes read by the server from the user agent are
   unmasked as follows:

      The /i/th byte is XORed with the /i mod 20/th byte of the client-
      to-server-mask.

   All subsequence bytes sent from the server to the user agent are
   masked as follows:

      The /i/th byte is XORed with the /i mod 20/th byte of the server-
      to-client-mask.
