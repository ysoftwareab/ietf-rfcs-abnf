Internet-Draft    CAPWAP Access Controller DHCP Option         June 2007


1.  Introduction

   The Control And Provisioning of Wireless Access Points Protocol
   (CAPWAP) [5] allows a Wireless Termination Point (WTP) to use DHCP to
   discover the Access Controllers (AC) it is to connect to.

   Prior to the CAPWAP Discovery process, the WTP MAY use one of many
   methods to identify the proper AC to establish a CAPWAP connection
   with.  One of these methods is through the DHCP protocol.  This is
   done through the CAPWAP AC DHCPv4 or CAPWAP AC DHCPv6 Option.

1.1.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].

1.2.  Terminology

   This document uses terminology defined in [6] and [5].

Internet-Draft    CAPWAP Access Controller DHCP Option         June 2007


2.  CAPWAP AC DHCPv4 Option

   This section defines a DHCPv4 option that carries a list of 32-bit
   (binary) IPv4 addresses indicating one or more CAPWAP AC available to
   the WTP.

   The DHCPv4 option for CAPWAP has the format shown in the following
   figure:

         0                   1
         0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
         |  option-code  | option-length |
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
         |                               |
         +       AC IPv4 Address         +
         |                               |
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
         |             ...               |
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   option-code:   OPTION_CAPWAP_AC_V4 (TBD)

   option-length:   Length of the 'options' field in octets; MUST be a
      multiple of four (4).

   AC IPv4 Address:  IPv4 address of a CAPWAP AC which the WTP may use.
      The ACs are listed in the order of preference for use by the WTP.

   A CAPWAP WTP, acting as a DHCPv4 client, SHOULD request the CAPWAP AC
   DHCPv4 Option in a Parameter Request List as described in [2] and
   [3].

   If configured with a (list of) CAPWAP AC address(es), a DHCPv4 server
   SHOULD send the client the CAPWAP AC DHCPv4 option, even if this
   option is not explicitly requested by the client.

   A CAPWAP WTP, acting as a DHCPv4 client, receiving the CAPWAP AC
   DHCPv4 option MAY use the (list of) IP address(es) to locate AC.  The
   CAPWAP protocol [5] provides guidance on the WTP's discovery process.

   The WTP, acting as a DHCPv4 client, SHOULD try the records in the
   order listed in the CAPWAP AC DHCPv4 option received from the DHCPv4
   server.

3.  CAPWAP AC DHCPv6 Option

   This section defines a DHCPv6 option that carries a list of 128-bit
   (binary) IPv6 addresses indicating one or more CAPWAP AC available to
   the WTP.

   The DHCPv6 option for CAPWAP has the format shown in the following
   figure:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |       option-code             |       option-length           |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                                                               |
       +                                                               +
       |                                                               |
       +                          AC IPv6 Address                      +
       |                                                               |
       +                                                               +
       |                                                               |

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   option-code:   OPTION_CAPWAP_AC_V6 (TBD)

   option-length:   Length of the 'options' field in octets; MUST be a
      multiple of sixteen (16).

   AC IPv6 Address:  IPv6 address of a CAPWAP AC which the WTP may use.
      The ACs are listed in the order of preference for use by the WTP.

   A CAPWAP WTP, acting as a DHCPv6 client, SHOULD request the CAPWAP AC
   DHCPv6 Option in a Parameter Request List as described in [2] and
   [3].

   If configured with a (list of) CAPWAP AC address(es), a DHCPv6 server

   DHCPv6 option MAY use the (list of) IP address(es) to locate AC.  The
   CAPWAP protocol [5] provides guidance on the WTP's discovery process.

   The WTP, acting as a DHCPv6 client, SHOULD try the records in the
   order listed in the CAPWAP AC DHCPv6 option received from the DHCPv6
   server.

4.  IANA Considerations

   The following DHCPv4 option code for CAPWAP AC option MUST be
   assigned by IANA:

           Option Name            Value       Described in
           -----------------------------------------------
           OPTION_CAPWAP_AC_V4    TBD         Section 2

   The following DHCPv6 option code for CAPWAP AC options MUST be
   assigned by IANA:

           Option Name             Value       Described in
           ------------------------------------------------
           OPTION_CAPWAP_AC_V6     TBD         Section 3

Internet-Draft    CAPWAP Access Controller DHCP Option         June 2007


5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations in [2], [3] and [4] apply.  If an
   adversary manages to modify the response from a DHCP server or insert
   its own response, a WTP could be led to contact a rogue CAPWAP AC,
   possibly one that then intercepts call requests or denies service.
   CAPWAP's use of DTLS MUST be used to authenticate the CAPWAP peers in
   the establishment of the session.

   In most of the networks, the DHCP exchange that delivers the options
   prior to network access authentication is neither integrity protected
   nor origin authenticated.  Therefore, the options defined in this
   document are not the only methods used to determine which AC a WTP
   should connect to.  The CAPWAP protocol [5] defines other AC
   discovery procedures a WTP MAY utilize.
