<a name="rfc.section.1"></a><h3>1.&nbsp;
Introduction</h3>

<p>It is often desirable to allow users to access a service that
provides a common function, but is actually offered by a variety of
local service providers.  In many of these cases, the service provider
chosen depends on the location of the person wishing to access that
service.  Among the best-known public services of this kind is
emergency calling, where emergency calls are routed to the most
appropriate public safety answering point (PSAP), based on the
caller's physical location.  Other services, from food delivery to
directory services and roadside assistance, also follow this general
pattern.  This is a mapping <a class='info' href='#RFC5012'>problem<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schulzrinne, H. and R. Marshall, &ldquo;Requirements for Emergency Context Resolution with Internet Technologies,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC5012],
where a geographic location and <a class='info' href='#RFC5031'>a service
identifier (URN)<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schulzrinne, H., &ldquo;A Uniform Resource Name (URN) for Emergency and Other Well-Known Services,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC5031] is translated into a set of URIs, the service
URIs, that allow the Internet system to contact an appropriate network
entity that provides the service.
</p>
<p>The caller does not need to know where the service is being
provided from, and the location of the service provider may change
over time, e.g., to deal with temporary overloads, failures in the
primary service provider location or long-term changes in system
architecture.  For emergency services, this problem is described in
more detail in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-ecrit-framework'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;ecrit&#8209;framework]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosen, B., Schulzrinne, H., Polk, J., and A. Newton, &ldquo;Framework for Emergency Calling using Internet Multimedia,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>The overall emergency calling <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-ecrit-framework'>architecture<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosen, B., Schulzrinne, H., Polk, J., and A. Newton, &ldquo;Framework for Emergency Calling using Internet Multimedia,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> [I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;ecrit&#8209;framework] separates
mapping from placing calls or otherwise invoking the service, so the
same mechanism can be used to verify that a mapping exists ("address
validation") or to obtain test service URIs.
</p>
<p>Mapping locations to URIs describing services requires a distributed,
scalable and highly resilient infrastructure.  Authoritative knowledge
about such mappings is distributed among a large number of autonomous
entities that may have no direct knowledge of each other.  In this
document, we describe an architecture for such a global service.  It
allows significant freedom to combine and split functionality among
actual servers and imposes few requirements as to who should operate
particular services.
</p>
<p>Besides determining the service URI, end systems also need to determine
the local service numbers.  As discussed in <a class='info' href='#configuration'>Section&nbsp;9<span> (</span><span class='info'>Configuring Service Numbers</span><span>)</span></a>, the architecture described here can also
address that problem.
</p>
<p>The architecture described here uses the <a class='info' href='#RFC5222'>Location-to-Service Translation (LoST)<span> (</span><span class='info'>Hardie, T., Newton, A., Schulzrinne, H., and H. Tschofenig, &ldquo;LoST: A Location-to-Service Translation Protocol,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC5222]
protocol, although much of the discussion would also apply for other
mapping protocols satisfying the mapping <a class='info' href='#RFC5012'>requirements<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schulzrinne, H. and R. Marshall, &ldquo;Requirements for Emergency Context Resolution with Internet Technologies,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC5012].

document uses the following terms to describe LoST clients and
servers:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>authoritative mapping server (AMS):</dt>
<dd> An authoritative
mapping server (AMS) is a LoST server that can provide the authoritative
answer to a particular set of queries, e.g., covering a set of PIDF-LO
civic labels or a particular region described by a geometric shape.  In
some (rare) cases of territorial disputes, two resolvers may be
authoritative for the same region.  An AMS may redirect or forward a
query to another AMS within the tree.
</dd>
<dt>child:</dt>
<dd>A child is an AMS that is authoritative for
a subregion of another AMS.  A child can in turn be parent for
another AMS.
</dd>
<dt>(tree node) cluster:</dt>
<dd>A node cluster is a group of LoST
servers that all share the same mapping information and return the same
results for queries.  Clusters provide redundancy and share query load. 
Clusters are fully-meshed, i.e., they all exchange updates with each
other.
</dd>
<dt>coverage region:</dt>
<dd>The coverage region of an AMS is the
geographic region within which the AMS is able to authoritatively answer
mapping queries.  Coverage regions are generally, but not necessarily,
contigous and may be represented as either a subset of a civic address
or a geometric object.
</dd>
<dt>forest guide (FG):</dt>
<dd>A forest guide (FG) has knowledge of
the coverage region of trees for a particular top-level service.
</dd>
<dt>mapping:</dt>
<dd>A mapping is a short-hand for 'mapping from a
location object to one or more URLs describing either another mapping
server or the desired service URLs'.
</dd>
<dt>parent:</dt>
<dd>A mapping server that covers the region of all of
its children.  A mapping server without a parent is a root AMS.
</dd>
<dt>resolver:</dt>
<dd>A resolver is contacted by a seeker, consults a
forest mapping server and then resolves the query using an appropriate
tree.  Resolvers may cache query results.
</dd>
<dt>seeker:</dt>
<dd>A seeker is a LoST client requesting a mapping.  A
seeker does not provide mapping services to others, but may cache
results for its own use.
</dd>
<dt>tree:</dt>
<dd> A tree consists of a self-contained hierarchy of
authoritative mapping servers for a particular service.  Each tree
exports its coverage region to the forest mapping servers.
</dd>

<a name="rfc.section.4.1"></a><h3>4.1.&nbsp;
The Principal Components</h3>

<p>The mapping architecture distinguishes four logical roles:  seekers,
resolvers, authoritative mapping servers (AMS) and forest guides (FGs). 
End users of the <a class='info' href='#RFC5222'>LoST-based<span> (</span><span class='info'>Hardie, T., Newton, A., Schulzrinne, H., and H. Tschofenig, &ldquo;LoST: A Location-to-Service Translation Protocol,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC5222] mapping
mechanism, called seekers, contact resolvers that cache query results
and know one or more forest guides.  Forest guides form the top level of
a conceptual hierarchy, with one or more trees providing a hierarchical
resolution service for different geographic regions.  Forest guides know
the geographic coverage region of all or almost all trees and direct
queries to the node at the top of the appropriate tree.  Trees consist
of authoritative mapping servers and maintain the authoritative mapping
information.
</p>
<p>Seekers, resolvers, authoritative mapping servers and forest guides
all communicate using LoST; indeed, it is likely that in many cases, the
same software can operate as a resolver, authoritative mapping server
and forest guide.  In addition to the basic LoST query <a class='info' href='#RFC5222'>protocol<span> (</span><span class='info'>Hardie, T., Newton, A., Schulzrinne, H., and H. Tschofenig, &ldquo;LoST: A Location-to-Service Translation Protocol,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC5222], a <a class='info' href='#I-D.schulzrinne-ecrit-lost-sync'>synchronization protocol<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schulzrinne, H., &ldquo;Synchronizing Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) Servers,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> [I&#8209;D.schulzrinne&#8209;ecrit&#8209;lost&#8209;sync]
may be used to exchange information between forest guides or to push
coverage information from a tree node to its parent.
</p>
<p>Seekers may be part of VoIP or other end systems, or SIP proxies or
similar call routing functions.
</p>
<p><a class='info' href='#arch'>Figure&nbsp;1</a> shows the interaction of the components.  The
lines indicating the connection between the forest guides are logical
connections, indicating that they are synchronizing their information
via the <a class='info' href='#I-D.schulzrinne-ecrit-lost-sync'>synchronization
protocol<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schulzrinne, H., &ldquo;Synchronizing Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) Servers,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> [I&#8209;D.schulzrinne&#8209;ecrit&#8209;lost&#8209;sync].

<p>The mapping function for the world is divided among trees.  The
collection of trees may not cover the whole world and trees are added
and removed as the organization of mapping data changes.  We call the
collection of trees a forest.  There is no limit on the number of trees
within the forest, but the author guesses that the number of trees will
likely be somewhere between a few hundred and a few thousand.  The lower
estimate would apply if each country operates one tree, the higher if
different governmental or private organizations within a country operate
independent trees.  We assume that tree coverage information changes
relatively slowly, on the order of less than one change per year per
tree, although the system imposes no specific threshold.  Tree coverage
would change, for example, if a country is split or merged or if two
trees for different regions become part of a larger tree.  (On the other
hand, information within a tree is likely to change much more
frequently.)

Minimal System Architecture</h3>

<p>It is possible to build a functioning system consisting only of
seekers and resolvers if these resolvers have other means of obtaining
mapping data.  For example, a company acting as a mapping service
provider could collect mapping records manually and make them available
to their customers through the resolver.  While feasible as a starting
point, such an architecture is unlikely to scale globally.  Among other
problems, it becomes very hard for providers of authoritative data to
ensure that all such providers have up-to-date information.  If new
trees are set up, they would somehow make themselves known to these
providers.  Such a mechanism would be similar to the old "hosts.txt"
mechanism for distributing host information in the early Internet before
DNS was developed.
</p>
<p>Below, we describe the operation of each component in more detail.

<a name="rfc.section.5"></a><h3>5.&nbsp;
Seeker</h3>

<p>Clients desiring location-to-service mappings are known as seekers. 
Seekers are consumers of mapping data and originate LoST queries as LoST
protocol clients.  Seekers do not answer LoST queries.  They contact
either forest guides or resolvers to find the appropriate tree that can
authoritatively answer their questions.  Seekers can be end systems such
as SIP user agents or call routing entities such as SIP proxy
servers.
</p>
<p>Seekers may need to obtain mapping information in several steps,
i.e., they may obtain pointers to intermediate servers that lead them
closer to the final mapping.  Seekers MAY cache query results for later
use, but otherwise have no obligations to other entities in the
system.
</p>
<p>Seekers need to be able to identify appropriate resolvers.  The
mechanism for providing seekers with that information is likely to
differ depending on who operates the resolvers.  For example, if the
voice service provider operates the resolver, it might include the
location of the resolver in the SIP configuration information it
distributes to its user agents.  An Internet access provider or
enterprise can provide a pointer to a resolver via DHCP <a class='info' href='#RFC5223'>[RFC5223]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schulzrinne, H., Polk, J., and H. Tschofenig, &ldquo;Discovering Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) Servers Using the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP),&rdquo; August&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>.  In an ad-hoc or
zero-configuration environment, appropriate service directories may
advertise resolvers.
</p>
<p>Like other entities in the system, seekers can cache responses.  This
is particularly useful if the response describes the result for a civic
or geospatial region, rather than just a point.  For example, for mobile
nodes, seekers would only have to update their resolution results when
they leave the coverage area of a service provider, such as a PSAP for
emergency services, and can avoid repeatedly polling for this
information whenever the location information changes slightly.  (Mobile
nodes would also need a location update mechanism that is either local
or triggered when they leave the current service area.) This will likely
be of particular benefit for seekers representing a large user
population, such as the outbound proxy in a corporate network.  For
example, rather than having to query separately for each cubicle,
information provided by the authoritative node may indicate that the
whole campus is covered by the same service provider.
</p>
<p>Given this caching mechanism and cache lifetimes of several days,
most mobile users traveling to and from work would only need to obtain
service area information along their commute route once during each
cache lifetime.

Resolver</h3>

<p>A seeker can contact a forest guide (see below) directly, but may not
be able to easily locate such a guide.  In addition, seekers in the same
geographic area may already have asked the same question.  Thus, it
makes sense to introduce another entity, known as a resolver in the
architecture, that knows how to contact one or more forest guides and
caches earlier queries to accelerate the response to mapping queries and
to improve the resiliency of the system.  Each resolver can decide
autonomously which FGs to use, with possibly different choices for each
top-level service.
</p>
<p>ISPs or VSPs may include the address of a suitable resolver in their
configuration information, e.g., in SIP configuration for a VSP or DHCP
<a class='info' href='#RFC5223'>[RFC5223]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schulzrinne, H., Polk, J., and H.

Resolvers are manually configured with the name of one or more forest
guides.

Trees: Maintaining Authoritative Knowledge</h3>

<a name="rfc.section.7.1"></a><h3>7.1.&nbsp;
Basic Operation</h3>

<p>The architecture assumes that authoritative knowledge about the
mapping data is distributed among many independent administrative
entities, but clients (seekers) may potentially need to find out mapping
information for any spot on earth.  (Extensions to extra-terrestrial
applications are left for future exploration.) Information is organized
hierarchically, in a tree, with tree nodes representing larger
geographic areas pointing to several child nodes each representing a
smaller area.  Each tree node can be a cluster of LoST servers that all
contain the same information and back up each other.
</p>
<p>Each tree can map a location described by either civic or geographic
coordinates, but not both, for one type of service (such as
'sos.police', 'sos.fire' or 'counseling'), although nothing prevents
re-using the same servers for multiple different services or both types
of coordinates.  The collection of all trees for one service is known as
a forest.
</p>
<p>Each tree root announces its coverage region to one or more forest
guides.
</p>
<p>Each tree node cluster knows the coverage region of its children and
sends queries to the appropriate server "down" the tree.  Each such tree
node knows authoritatively about the service mappings for a particular
region, typically, but not necessarily, contiguous.  The region can be
described by any of the shapes in the LoST specification expressed in
geospatial coordinates, such as circles or polygons, or a set of civic
address descriptors (e.g., "country = DE, A1 = Bavaria").  These
coverage regions may be aligned with political boundaries, but that is
not required.  In most cases, to avoid confusion, only one cluster is
responsible for a particular geographic or civic location, but the
system can also deal with cases where coverage regions overlap.
</p>
<p>There are no assumptions about the coverage region of a tree as a
whole.  For example, a tree could cover a single city, or a
state/province or a whole country.  Nodes within a tree need to loosely
coordinate their operation, but they do not need to be operated by the
same administrator.
</p>
<p>The tree architecture is roughly similar to the domain name system
(DNS), except that delegation is not by label, but rather by region. 
(Naturally, DNS does not have the notion of forest guides.) One can also
draw analogies to LDAP, when deployed in a distributed fashion.
</p>
<p>Tree nodes maintain two types of information, namely coverage regions
and mappings.  Coverage regions describe the region served by a child
node in the tree and point to a child node for further resolution. 
Mappings contain an actual service URI leading to a service provider or
another signaling server representing a group of service providers,
which in turn might further route signaling requests to more servers
covering smaller regions.
</p>
<p>Leaf nodes, i.e., nodes without children, only maintain mappings,
while tree nodes above the leaf nodes only maintain coverage regions. 
An example for emergency services of a leaf node entry is shown below,
indicating how queries for three towns are directed to different PSAPs. 
Queries for Englewood are directed to another LoST server instead.
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>

US        NJ Bergen     Englewood englewoodnj.gov
....
</pre></div>
<p>Coverage regions are described by sets of LoST-compatible shapes
enclosing contiguous geographic areas or by descriptors enumerating
groups of civic locations.  For the former, the LoST server performs the
same matching operation as described in Section 12.2 of the <a class='info' href='#RFC5222'>LoST specification<span> (</span><span class='info'>Hardie, T., Newton, A., Schulzrinne, H., and H. Tschofenig, &ldquo;LoST: A Location-to-Service Translation Protocol,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC5222] to find the tree or AMS.
</p>
<p>As a civic location example, a state-level tree node for New Jersey
in the United States may contain the coverage region entries shown
below, indicating that any query matching a location in Bergen County,
for example, would be redirected or forwarded to the node located at
bergen.nj.example.org.
</p>
<p>There is no requirement that all child nodes cover the same level
within the civic hierarchy.  As an example, in the table below, the city
of Newark has decided to be listed directly within the state node,
rather than through the county.  Longest-match rules allow partial
coverage, so that for queries for all other towns within Essex county
would be directed to the county node for further resolution.
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>

US NJ Essex      *      essex.nj.example.org/sos
US NJ Essex      Newark newark.example.com/sos
....
</pre></div>
<p>Thus, there is no substantial difference between coverage region and
mapping data.  The only difference is that coverage regions return names
of LoST servers, while mapping entries contain service URLs.  Mapping
entries may be specific down to the house or floor level or may only
contain street-level information.  For example, in the United States,
civic mapping data for emergency services is generally limited to
address ranges ("MSAG data"), so initial mapping databases may only
contain street-level information.
</p>
<p>To automate the maintenance of trees, the <a class='info' href='#I-D.schulzrinne-ecrit-lost-sync'>LoST synchronization
mechanism<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schulzrinne, H., &ldquo;Synchronizing Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) Servers,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> [I&#8209;D.schulzrinne&#8209;ecrit&#8209;lost&#8209;sync] allows nodes to query other nodes for mapping data and
coverage regions, both within a cluster and across different hierarchy
levels in a tree.  In the example above, the state-run node would query
the county nodes and use the records returned to distribute incoming
LoST queries to the county nodes.  Conversely, nodes could also contact
their parent nodes to tell them about their coverage region.  There is
some benefit of child nodes contacting their parents, as this allows
changes in coverage region to propagate quickly up the tree.

<a name="rfc.section.7.2"></a><h3>7.2.&nbsp;
Answering Queries</h3>

<p>Within a tree, the basic operation is straightforward:  A query
reaches the root of the tree.  That node determines which coverage
region matches that request and forwards the request to the URL
indicated in the coverage region record, returning a response to the
querier when it in turns receives an answer (recursion).  Alternatively,
the node returns the URL of that child node to the querier (iteration). 
This process applies to each node, i.e., a node does not need to know
whether the original query came from a parent node, a seeker, a forest
guide or a resolver.
</p>
<p>For efficiency, a node MAY return region information instead of a
point answer.  Thus, instead of returning that a particular geospatial
coordinate maps to a service or mapping URL, it MAY return a polygon
indicating the region for which this answer would be returned, along
with expiration time (time-to-live) information.  The querying node can
then cache this information for future use.
</p>
<p>For civic coordinates, trees may not include individual mapping
records for each floor, house number or street.  To avoid giving the
wrong indication that a particular location has been found valid, LoST
can indicate which parts of the location information have actually been
used to look up a mapping.

<a name="rfc.section.7.3"></a><h3>7.3.&nbsp;
Overlapping Coverage Regions</h3>

<p>In some cases, coverage regions may overlap, either because there is
a dispute as to who handles a particular geographic region or, more
likely, since the resolution of the coverage map may not be sufficiently
high.  For example, a node may "shave some corners" off its polygon, so
that its coverage region appears to overlap with its geographic
neighbor.  For civic coordinates, houses on the same street may be
served by different PSAPs.  The mapping mechanism needs to work even if
a coverage map is imprecise or if there are disputes about coverage.
</p>
<p>The solution for overlapping coverage regions is relatively simple.
If a query matches multiple coverage regions, the node returns all URLs, in
redirection mode, or queries both children, if in recursive mode. If the
overlapping coverage is caused by imprecise coverage maps, only one will
return a result and the others will return an error indication. If the
particular location is disputed territory, the response will contain all
answers, leaving it to the querier to choose the preferred solution or
trying to contact all services in turn.

Scaling and Reliability</h3>

<p>Since they provide authoritative information, tree nodes need to be
highly reliable.  Thus, while this document refers to tree nodes as
logical entities within the tree, an actual implementation would likely
replicate node information across several servers, forming a cluster. 
Each such node would have the same information.  Standard techniques
such as DNS SRV records can be used to select one of the servers. 
Replication within the cluster can use any suitable protocol mechanism,
but a standardized incremental update mechanism makes it easier to
spread those nodes across multiple independently-administered locations. 
The techniques developed for <a class='info' href='#RFC3528'>meshed SLP<span> (</span><span class='info'>Zhao, W., Schulzrinne, H., and E. Guttman, &ldquo;Mesh-enhanced Service Location Protocol (mSLP),&rdquo; April&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3528] are

<a name="rfc.section.8"></a><h3>8.&nbsp;
Forest Guides</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, just having trees covering various regions of the
world is not sufficient as a client of the mapping protocol would not
generally be able to keep track of all the trees in the forest.  To
facilitate orientation among the trees, we introduce a forest guide (FG)
which keeps track of the coverage regions of all the trees for one
service.  For scalability and reliability, there will need to be a large
number of forest guides, all providing the same information.  A seeker
can contact a suitable forest guide and will then be directed to the
right tree or, rarely, set of trees.  Forest guides do not provide
mapping information themselves, but rather redirect to mapping servers. 
In some configurations, not all forest guides may provide the same
information, due to policy reasons.
</p>
<p>Forest guides fulfill a similar role to root servers in DNS.
They distribute information, signed for authenticity, offered by trees. 
However, introducing forest guides avoids creating a global root, with
the attendant management and control issues.
</p>
<p>However, unlike DNS root servers, forest guides may offer different
information based on local policy.  Forest guides can also restrict
their data synchronization to parts of the information.  For example, if
country C does not recognize country T, C can propagate tree regions for
all but T.
</p>
<p>For authenticity, the coverage regions SHOULD be digitally signed by
the authorities responsible for the region, as discussed in more detail
in <a class='info' href='#security'>Section&nbsp;10<span> (</span><span class='info'>Security Considerations</span><span>)</span></a>.  They are used by resolvers and possibly
seekers to find the appropriate tree for a particular area.  All forest
guides should have consistent information, i.e., a collection of all the
coverage regions of all the trees.  A tree node at the top of a tree can
contact any forest guide and inject new coverage region information into
the system.  One would expect that each tree announces its coverage to
more than one forest guide.  Each forest guide peers with one or more
other guides and distributes new coverage region announcements to other
guides.  Due to policy and maybe political reasons, not all forest
guides may share the same coverage region data.
</p>
<p>Forest guides can, in principle, be operated by anybody, including
voice service providers, Internet access providers, dedicated services
providers and enterprises.
</p>
<p>As in routing, peering with other forest guides implies a certain
amount of trust in the peer.  Thus, peering is likely to require some
negotiation between the administering parties concerned, rather than
automatic configuration. The mechanism itself does not imply a particular
policy as to who gets to advertise a particular coverage region.

Configuring Service Numbers</h3>

<p>The section below is not directly related to the problem of
determining service location, but is an instance of the more generic
problem solved by this architecture, namely mapping location information
to service-related parameters, such as service numbers.
</p>
<p>For the foreseeable future, some user devices and software will
emulate the user interface of a telephone, i.e., the only way to enter
call address information is via a 12-button keypad with digits and the
asterisk and hash symbol.  These devices use service numbers to identify
services.  The best-known examples of service numbers are emergency
numbers, such as 9-1-1 in North America and 1-1-2 in Europe.  However,
many other public and private service numbers have been defined, ranging
in the United States from 3-1-1 for non-emergency local government
services to 4-1-1 for directory assistance to various "800" numbers for
anything from roadside assistance to legal services to home-delivery
food.
</p>
<p>Such service numbers are likely to be used until essentially all
communication devices feature IP connectivity and an alphanumeric
keyboard.  Unfortunately, for emergency services, more than 60 emergency
numbers are in use throughout the world, with many of those numbers
serving non-emergency purposes elsewhere, e.g., identifying repair or
directory services.  Countries also occasionally change their emergency
numbers to conform to regional agreements.  An example is the
introduction of "1-1-2" for countries in Europe.
</p>
<p>Thus, a system that allows devices to be used internationally to
place calls needs to allow devices to discover service numbers
automatically.  In the Internet-based system proposed <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-ecrit-framework'>here<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosen, B., Schulzrinne, H., Polk, J., and A. Newton, &ldquo;Framework for Emergency Calling using Internet Multimedia,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> [I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;ecrit&#8209;framework], these numbers are
strictly used as a human user interface mechanism and are generally
not visible in call signaling messages, which carry the <a class='info' href='#RFC5031'>service URN<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schulzrinne, H., &ldquo;A Uniform Resource Name (URN) for Emergency and Other Well-Known Services,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC5031] instead.
</p>
<p>For the best user experience, systems should be able to discover two
sets of service numbers, namely those used in the user's home country
and in the country the user is currently visiting.  The user is most
likely to remember the former, but a companion borrowing a device in an
emergency, say, may only know the local emergency numbers.
</p>
<p>Determining home and local service numbers is a configuration
problem, but unfortunately, existing configuration mechanisms are
ill-suited for this purpose.  For example, a DHCP server might be able
to provide the local service numbers, but not the home numbers.  When
virtual private networks (VPNs) are used, even DHCP may provide numbers
of uncertain origin, as a user may contact the home network or some
local branch office of the corporate network.  Similarly, SIP <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-sipping-config-framework'>configuration<span> (</span><span class='info'>Channabasappa, S., &ldquo;A Framework for Session Initiation Protocol User Agent Profile Delivery,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a> [I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;sipping&#8209;config&#8209;framework] would be
able to provide the numbers valid at the location of the SIP service
provider, but even a SIP service provider with national footprint may
serve customers that are visiting any number of other countries.
</p>
<p>Also, while initially there are likely to be only a few service
numbers, e.g., for emergency services, the LoST architecture can be used
to support other services, as noted.  Configuring every local DHCP or
SIP configuration server with that information is likely to be
error-prone and tedious.
</p>
<p>For these reasons, the LoST-based mapping architecture supports
providing service numbers to end systems based on caller location.  The
mapping operation is almost exactly the same as for determining the
service URL.  The mapping can be obtained either along with the service
URL or through a separate request.  The major difference between the two
requests is that service numbers often have much larger regions of
validity than the service URL itself.  Also, the service number is
likely to be valid longer than the service URL.  Finally, an end system
may want to look up the service number for its home location, not just
its current (visited) location.

discussed in <a class='info' href='#RFC5069'>[RFC5069]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Taylor, T., Tschofenig, H., Schulzrinne, H., and M. Shanmugam, &ldquo;Security Threats and Requirements for Emergency Call Marking and Mapping,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>, while <a class='info' href='#RFC5031'>[RFC5031]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schulzrinne, H., &ldquo;A Uniform Resource Name (URN) for Emergency and Other Well-Known Services,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>
discusses issues related to the service URN, one of the inputs into
the mapping protocol.  LoST-related security considerations are
naturally discussed in the <a class='info' href='#RFC5222'>LoST<span> (</span><span class='info'>Hardie, T., Newton, A., Schulzrinne, H., and H. Tschofenig, &ldquo;LoST: A Location-to-Service Translation Protocol,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC5222]
specification.
</p>
<p>The architecture addresses the following security issues, usually
through the underlying transport security associations:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Server impersonation:</dt>
<dd> Seekers, resolvers, fellow tree
guides and cluster members can assure themselves of the identity of the
remote party by using the facilities in the underlying channel security
mechanism, such as <a class='info' href='#RFC5246'>TLS<span> (</span><span class='info'>Dierks, T. and E. Rescorla, &ldquo;The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC5246].
</dd>
<dt>Query or query result corruption:</dt>
<dd> To avoid that an
attacker can modify the query or its result, the architecture
RECOMMENDS the use of channel security, such as TLS.  Results SHOULD
also be digitally signed, e.g., using <a class='info' href='#W3C.REC-xmldsig-core-20020212'>XML
digital signatures<span> (</span><span class='info'>Eastlake, D., Solo, D., and J. Reagle, &ldquo;XML-Signature Syntax and Processing,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> [W3C.REC&#8209;xmldsig&#8209;core&#8209;20020212].  Note, however, that simple origin
assertion may not provide the end system with enough useful
information as it has no good way of knowing that a particular signer
is authorized to represent a particular geographic area.  It might be
necessary that certain well-known Certificate Authorities (CAs) vet
sources of mapping information and provide special certificates for
that purpose.  In many cases, a seeker will have to trust its local
resolver to vet information for trustworthiness; in turn, the resolver
may rely on trusted forest guides to steer it to the correct
information.
</dd>
<dt>Coverage region corruption:</dt>
<dd> To avoid that a third party
or an untrustworthy member of a server population claims a coverage
region that it is not authorized for, any node introducing a new region
map MUST sign the object by protecting the data with an <a class='info' href='#W3C.REC-xmldsig-core-20020212'>XML digital signature<span> (</span><span class='info'>Eastlake, D., Solo, D., and J. Reagle, &ldquo;XML-Signature Syntax and Processing,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> [W3C.REC&#8209;xmldsig&#8209;core&#8209;20020212].  A
recipient MUST verify, through a local policy mechanism, that the
signing entity is indeed authorized to speak for that region. 
Determining who can speak for a particular region is inherently
difficult unless there is a small set of authorizing entities that
participants in the mapping architecture can trust.  Receiving systems
should be particularly suspicious if an existing coverage region is
replaced with a new one with a new mapping address.  In many cases,
trust will be mediated:  A seeker will have a trust relationship with a
resolver.  The resolver, in turn, will contact a trusted forest
guide.
</dd>

<p>Additional threats that need to be addressed by operational
measures include denial-of-service attacks <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;ecrit&#8209;phonebcp]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosen, B. and J.
