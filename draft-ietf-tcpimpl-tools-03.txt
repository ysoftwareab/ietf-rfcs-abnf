    1.	Status of this Memo

       This document is	an Internet Draft.  Internet Drafts are	working
       documents of the	Internet Engineering Task Force	(IETF),	its
       areas, and its working groups.  Note that other groups may also
       distribute working documents as Internet	Drafts.

       Internet	Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six
       months, and may be updated, replaced, or	obsoleted by other docu-
       ments at	any time.  It is inappropriate to use Internet Drafts as
       reference material or to	cite them other	than as	``work in pro-
       gress''.

    2.	Introduction

       Available tools for testing TCP implementations are catalogued by
       this memo.  Hopefully disseminating this	information will
       encourage those responsible for building	and maintaining	TCP to
       make the	best use of available tests.  The type of testing the
       tool provides, the type of tests	it is capable of doing,	and its
       availability is enumerated.  This document lists	only tools which
       can evaluate one	or more	TCP implementations, or	which can privde
       some specific results which describe or evaluate	the TCP	being
       tested.	A number of these tools	produce	time-sequence plots, see

       Tim Shepard's thesis [She91] for	a general discussion of	these
       plots.

       Each tools is defined as	follows:

    Name

       The name	associated with	the testing tool.

    Category

       One or more categories of tests which the tools is capable of
       providing.  Categories used so far: functional correctness, per-
       formance, stress.  Functional correctness tests how stringent a
       TCP implementation is to	the RFC	specifications.	 Performance
       tests how quickly a TCP implementation can send and receive data,
       etc.  Stress tests how a	TCP implementation is effected under
       high load conditions.

    Description

       A description of	the tools construction,	and the	implementation
       methodology of the tests.

    Automation

       What steps are required to complete the test?  What human inter-
       vention is required?

    Availability

       How do you retrieve this	tool and get more information about it?

    Required Environment

       Compilers, OS version, etc. required to build and/or run	the
       associated tool.

    3.1.  Dbs


    Author
       Yukio Murayama


    Category
       Performance / Stress


    Description
       Dbs is a	tool which allows multiple data	transfers to be	coordi-
       nated, and the resulting	TCP behavior to	be reviewed.  Results
       are presented as	ASCII log files.


    Automation
       Command of execution is driven by a script file.


    Availability
       See http://www.ai3.net/products/dbs for details of precise OS
       versions	supported, and for download of the source code.	 Current
       implementation supports BSDI BSD/OS, Linux, mkLinux, SunOS, IRIX,
       Ultrix, NEWS OS,	HP-UX.	Other environments are likely easy to

INTERNET-DRAFT	Some Testing Tools for TCP Implementors	   November 1997


    Description
       Dummynet	is a tool which	simulates the presence of finite size
       queues, bandwidth limitations, and communication	delays.	 Dum-
       mynet inserts between two layers	of the protocol	stack (in the
       current implementation between TCP and IP), simulating the above
       effects in an operational system.  This way experiments can be
       done using real protocol	implementations	and real applications,
       even running on the same	host (dummynet also intercepts communi-
       cations on the loopback interface).  Reconfiguration of dummynet
       parameters (delay, queue	size, bandwidth) can be	done on	the fly
       by using	a sysctl call.	The overhead of	dummynet is extremely
       low.


    Automation
       Requires	merging	diff files with	kernel source code.  Command-
       line driven through the sysctl command to modify	kernel vari-
       ables.


    Availability
       See http://www.iet.unipi.it/~luigi/research.html	or e-mail Luigi
       Rizzo (l.rizzo@iet.unipi.it).  Source code is available for
       FreeBSD 2.1 and FreeBSD 2.2 (easily adaptable to	other BSD-
       derived systems).


    Required Environment
       C language compiler, BSD-derived	system,	kernel source code.

    Description
       Single connection bandwidth or latency tests for	TCP, UDP, and
       DLPI.  Includes provisions for CPU utilization measurement.


    Automation
       Requires	compilation (K&R C sufficient for all but -DHISTOGRAM,
       may require ANSI	C in the future) if starting from source. Execu-
       tion as child of	inetd requires editing of /etc/services	and
       /etc/inetd.conf.	 Scripts are provided for a quick look
       (snapshot_script), bulk throughput of TCP and UDP, and latency
       for TCP and UDP.	 It is command-line driven.


    Availability
       See http://www.cup.hp.com/netperf/NetperfPage.html or e-mail Rick
       Jones (raj@cup.hp.com).	Binaries are available here for	HP/UX
       Irix, Solaris, and Win32.


    Required Environment
       C language compiler, POSIX.1, sockets.



    3.4.  NIST Net


    Author
       Mark Carson


    Category
       Functional Correctness /	Performance


    Description
       NIST Net	is a network emulator.	The tool is packaged as	a Linux
       kernel patch, a kernel module, a	set of programming APIs, and
       command-line and	X-based	user interfaces.

       NIST Net	works by turning the system into a "selectively	bad"
       router -	incoming packets may be	delayed, dropped, duplicated,
       bandwidth-constrained, etc.  Packet delays may be fixed or ran-
       domly distributed, with loadable	probability distributions.
       Packet loss may be uniformly distributed	or congestion-dependent.





Parker,	Schmechel, Editors				[Page 5]






INTERNET-DRAFT	Some Testing Tools for TCP Implementors	   November 1997


    Automation
       To control the operation	of the emulator, there is an interactive
       user interface, a non-interactive command-line interface, and a
       set of APIs.  Any or all	of these may be	used in	concert.  The
       interactive interface is	suitable for simple, spur-of-the-moment
       testing,	while the command-line or APIs may be used to create
       scripted, non-interactive tests.


    Availability
       NIST Net	is available for public	download from the NIST Net web
       site, http://www.antd.nist.gov/itg/nistnet/.  The web site also
       has installation	instructions and documentation.


    Required Environment
       NIST Net	requires a Linux installtion, with kernel version 2.0.27
       - 2.0.33.  A kernel source tree and build tools are required to
       build and install the NIST Net components.  Building the	X inter-
       face requires a version of XFree86 (Current Version is 3.3.2).
       An Athena-replacement widget set	such as	neXtaw
       (http://www.inf.ufrgs.br/~kojima/nextaw/) is also desirable for
       an improved user	interface.

       NIST Net	should run on any i386-compatible machine capable of
       running Linux, with one or more interfaces.



    3.5.  Orchestra


    Author
       Scott Dawson, Farnam Jahanian, and Todd Mitton


    Category
       Functional Correctness /	Performance


    Description
       This tool is a library which provides the user with an ability to
       build a protocol	layer capable of performing fault injection on
       protocols.  Several fault injection layers have been built using
       this library, one of which has been used	to test	different vendor
       implementations of TCP.	This is	accomplished by	probing	the ven-
       dor implementation from one machine containing a	protocol stack
       that has	been instrumented with Orchestra.  A connection	is



Parker,	Schmechel, Editors				[Page 6]






INTERNET-DRAFT	Some Testing Tools for TCP Implementors	   November 1997


       opened from the vendor TCP implementation to the	machine	which
       has been	instrumented.  Faults may then be injected at the
       Orchestra side of the connection	and the	vendor TCP's response
       may be monitored.  The most recent version of Orchestra runs
       inside the X-kernel protocol stack on the OSF MK	operating sys-
       tem.

       When using Orchestra to test a protocol,	the fault injection
       layer is	placed below the target	protocol in the	protocol stack.
       This can	either be done on one machine on the network, if proto-
       col stacks on the other machines	cannot be modified (as in the
       case of testing TCP), or	can be done on all machines on the net-
       work (as	in the case of testing a protocol under	development).
       Once the	fault injection	layer is in the	protocol stack,	all mes-
       sages sent by and destined for the target protocol pass through
       it on their way to/from the network.  The Orchestra fault injec-
       tion layer can manipulate these messages.  In particular, it can
       drop, delay, re-order, duplicate, or modify messages.  It can
       also introduce new messages into	the system if desired.

       The actions of the Orchestra fault injection layer on each mes-
       sage are	determined by a	script,	written	in Tcl.	 This script is
       interpreted by the fault	injection layer	when the message enters
       the layer.  The script has access to the	header information about
       the message, and	can make decisions based on header values.  It
       can also	keep information about previous	messages, counters, or
       any other data which the	script writer deems useful.  Users of
       Orchestra may also define their own actions to be taken on mes-
       sages, written in C, that may be	called from the	fault injection
       scripts.


    Automation
       Scripts can be specified	either using a graphical user interface
       which generates Tcl, or by writing Tcl directly.	 At this time,
       post-analysis of	the results of the test	must also be performed
       by the user.  Essentially this consists of looking at a packet
       trace that Orchestra generates for (in)correct behavior.	 Must
       compile and link	fault generated	layer with the protocol	stack.

    3.6.  Packet Shell


    Author
       Steve Parker and	Chris Schmechel


    Category
       Functional Correctness /	Performance


    Description
       An extensible Tcl/Tk based software toolset for protocol	develop-
       ment and	testing. Tcl (Tool Command Language) is	an embeddable
       scripting language and Tk is a graphical	user interface toolkit
       based on	Tcl.  The Packet Shell creates Tcl commands that allow
       you to create, modify, send, and	receive	packets	on networks.
       The operations for each protocol	are supplied by	a dynamic linked
       library called a	protocol library.  These libraries are silently
       linked in from a	special	directory when the Packet Shell	begins
       execution. The current protocol libraries are: IP, IPv6,	IPv6
       extensions, ICMP, ICMPv6, Ethernet layer, data layer, file layer
       (snoop and tcpdump support), socket layer, TCP, TLI.

       It includes harness, which is a Tk based	graphical user interface
       for creating test scripts within	the Packet Shell.  It includes
       tests for no initial slow start,	and retain out of sequence data
       as TCP test cases mentioned in [PADHV98].

       It includes tcpgraph, which is used with	a snoop	or tcpdump cap-
       ture file to produce a TCP time-sequence	plot using xplot.


    Automation
       Command-line driven through Tcl commands, or graphical user
       interface models	are available through the harness format.

    3.7.  Tcpanaly


    Author
       Vern Paxson


    Category
       Functional Correctness /	Performance


    Description
       This is a tool for automatically	analyzing a TCP	implementation's
       behavior	by inspecting packet traces of the TCP's activity. It
       does so through packet filter traces produced by	tcpdump.  It has
       coded within it knowledge of a large number of TCP implementa-
       tions.  Using this, it can determine whether a given trace
       appears consistent with a given implementation, and, if so,
       exactly why the TCP chose to transmit each packet at the	time it
       did.  If	a trace	is found inconsistent with a TCP, tcpanaly
       either diagnoses	a likely measurement error present in the trace,
       or indicates exactly whether the	activity in the	trace deviates
       from that of the	TCP, which can greatly aid in determining how
       the traced implementation behaves.

       Tcpanaly's category is somewhat difficult to classify, since it
       attempts	to profile the behavior	of an implementation, rather
       than to explicitly test specific	correctness or performance
       issues.	However, this profile identifies correctness and perfor-
       mance problems.

       Adding new implementations of TCP behavior is possible with tcpa-
       naly through the	use of C++ classes.

    Description
       This is a TCP trace file	analysis tool.	It reads output	trace
       files in	the formats of : tcpdump, snoop, etherpeek, and	netm.

       For each	connection, it keeps track of elapsed time,
       bytes/segments sent and received, retransmissions, round	trip
       times, window advertisements, throughput, etc from simple to very

    Description
       This is a TCP throughput	measurement tool based on sending UDP or
       ICMP packets in patterns	that are controlled at the user-level so
       that their timing reflects what would be	sent by	a TCP that
       observes	proper congestion control (and implements SACK).  This
       allows it to measure throughput independent of the TCP implemen-
       tation of end hosts and serve as	a useful platform for prototyp-
       ing TCP changes.

    4.	Summary

       This draft lists	all TCP	tests and testing tools	reported to the
       authors as part of TCP Implementer's working group and is not
       exhaustive.  These tools	have been verified as available	by the
       authors.



    5.	Security Considerations

       Network analysis	tools are improving at a steady	pace.  The con-
       tinuing improvement in these tools such as the ones described
       make security concerns significant.

       Some of the tools could be used to create rogue packets or
       denial-of-service attacks against other hosts.  Also, some of the
       tools require changes to	the kernel (foreign code) and might
       require root privileges to execute.  So you are trusting	code
       that you	have fetched from some perhaps untrustworthy remote
       site.  This code	could contain malicious	code that could	present
       any kind	of attack.




Parker,	Schmechel, Editors			       [Page 14]






INTERNET-DRAFT	Some Testing Tools for TCP Implementors	   November 1997


       None of the listed tools	evaluate security in any way or	form.

       There are privacy concerns when grabbing	packets	from the network
       in that you are now able	to read	other people's mail, files, etc.
       This impacts more than just the host running the	tool but all
       traffic crossing	the host's physical network.
