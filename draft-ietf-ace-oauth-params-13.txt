      Additional OAuth Parameters for Authorization in Constrained
                           Environments (ACE)
                     draft-ietf-ace-oauth-params-13

Abstract

   This specification defines new parameters and encodings for the OAuth
   2.0 token and introspection endpoints when used with the framework
   for authentication and authorization for constrained environments
   (ACE).  These are used to express the proof-of-possession key the
   client wishes to use, the proof-of-possession key that the
   Authorization Server has selected, and the key the Resource Server
   uses to authenticate to the client.

1.  Introduction

   The Authentication and Authorization for Constrained Environments
   (ACE) specification [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz] requires some new
   parameters for interactions with the OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] token and
   introspection endpoints, as well as some new claims to be used in
   access tokens.  These parameters and claims can also be used in other
   contexts and have therefore been put into a dedicated document, to
   facilitate their use in a manner independent of
   [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz].

   Note that although all examples are shown in Concise Binary Object
   Respresentation (CBOR) [RFC7049], JSON [RFC8259] MAY be used as an
   alternative for HTTP-based communications, as specified in
   [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz].

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Readers are assumed to be familiar with the terminology from
   [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz], especially the terminology for entities
   in the architecture such as client (C), resource server (RS) and
   authorization server (AS).

   Terminology from [RFC8152] is used in the examples, especially
   COSE_Key defined in section 7 of [RFC8152].

   Note that the term "endpoint" is used here following its OAuth 2.0
   [RFC6749] definition, which is to denote resources such as token and
   introspection at the AS and authz-info at the RS.  The Constrained
   Application Protocol (CoAP) [RFC7252] definition, which is "An entity
   participating in the CoAP protocol" is not used in this
   specification.

3.  Parameters for the Token Endpoint

   This section defines additional parameters for the interactions with
   the token endpoint in the ACE framework [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz].

3.1.  Client-to-AS Request

   This section defines the "req_cnf" parameter allowing clients to
   request a specific proof-of-possession key in an access token from a
   token endpoint in the ACE framework [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz]:

   req_cnf
      OPTIONAL.  This field contains information about the key the
      client would like to bind to the access token for proof-of-
      possession.  It is RECOMMENDED that an AS reject a request
      containing a symmetric key value in the 'req_cnf' field
      (kty=Symmetric), since the AS is expected to be able to generate
      better symmetric keys than a constrained client.  The AS MUST
      verify that the client really is in possession of the
      corresponding key.  Values of this parameter follow the syntax and
      semantics of the "cnf" claim either from section 3.1 of
      [I-D.ietf-ace-cwt-proof-of-possession] for CBOR-based interactions
      or from section 3.1 of [RFC7800] for JSON-based interactions.

    }

                                   key.

3.2.  AS-to-Client Response

   This section defines the following additional parameters for an AS
   response to a request to the token endpoint:

   cnf
      REQUIRED if the token type is "pop" and a symmetric key is used.
      MAY be present for asymmetric proof-of-possession keys.  This
      field contains the proof-of-possession key that the AS selected
      for the token.  Values of this parameter follow the syntax and
      semantics of the "cnf" claim either from section 3.1 of
      [I-D.ietf-ace-cwt-proof-of-possession] for CBOR-based interactions
      of from section 3.1 of [RFC7800] for JSON-based interactions.  See
      Section 5 for additional discussion of the usage of this
      parameter.


   rs_cnf
      OPTIONAL if the token type is "pop" and asymmetric keys are used.
      MUST NOT be present otherwise.  This field contains information
      about the public key used by the RS to authenticate.  If this

      parameter is absent, either the RS does not use a public key or
      the AS knows that the RS can authenticate itself to the client
      without additional information.  Values of this parameter follow
      the syntax and semantics of the "cnf" claim either from section
      3.1 of [I-D.ietf-ace-cwt-proof-of-possession] for CBOR-based
      interactions or from section 3.1 of [RFC7800] for JSON-based
      interactions.  See Section 5 for additional discussion of the
      usage of this parameter.

   Figure 2 shows an AS response containing a token and a "cnf"
   parameter with a symmetric proof-of-possession key.

   previously requested asymmetric proof-of-possession key (not shown)
   and a "rs_cnf" parameter containing the public key of the RS.

4.  Parameters for the Introspection Endpoint

   This section defines the use of CBOR instead of JSON for the "cnf"
   introspection response parameter specified in section 9.4 of
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-mtls].

   If CBOR is used instead of JSON in an interaction with the
   introspection endpoint, the AS MUST use the parameter mapping
   specified in Figure 5 and the value must follow the syntax of "cnf"
   claim values from section 3.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-ace-cwt-proof-of-possession].

   Figure 4 shows an AS response to an introspection request including
   the "cnf" parameter to indicate the proof-of-possession key bound to
   the token.

5.  Confirmation Method Parameters

   The confirmation method parameters are used as follows:

   o  "req_cnf" in the access token request C -> AS, OPTIONAL to
      indicate the client's raw public key, or the key-identifier of a
      previously established key between C and RS that the client wishes
      to use for proof-of-possession of the access token.

   o  "cnf" in the token response AS -> C, OPTIONAL if using an
      asymmetric key or a key that the client requested via a key
      identifier in the request.  REQUIRED if the client didn't specify
      a "req_cnf" and symmetric keys are used.  Used to indicate the
      symmetric key generated by the AS for proof-of-possession of the
      access token.

   o  "cnf" in the introspection response AS -> RS, REQUIRED if the
      access token that was subject to introspection is a proof-of-
      possession token, absent otherwise.  Indicates the proof-of-
      possession key bound to the access token.

   o  "rs_cnf" in the token response AS -> C, OPTIONAL to indicate the
      public key of the RS, if it uses one to authenticate itself to the
      client and the binding between key and RS identity is not
      established through other means.

Internet-Draft              ACE-OAuth-Params                  April 2020


   Note that the COSE_Key structure in a confirmation claim or parameter
   may contain an "alg" or "key_ops" parameter.  If such parameters are
   present, a client MUST NOT use a key that is incompatible with the
   profile or proof-of-possession algorithm according to those
   parameters.  An RS MUST reject a proof-of-possession using such a
   key.

   If an access token is issued for an audience that includes several
   RS, the "rs_cnf" parameter MUST NOT be used, since the client cannot
   determine for which RS the key applies.  This document recommends to
   specify a different endpoint that the client can use to acquire RS
   authentication keys in such cases.  The specification of such an
   endpoint is out of scope for this document.

6.  CBOR Mappings

   If CBOR is used, the new parameters and claims defined in this
   document MUST be mapped to CBOR types as specified in Figure 5, using
   the given integer abbreviation for the map key.

       /----------+----------+-------------------------------------\
       | Name     | CBOR Key | Value Type | Usage                  |
       |----------+----------+-------------------------------------|
       | req_cnf  | TBD (4)  | map        | token request          |
       | cnf      | TBD (8)  | map        | token response         |
       | cnf      | TBD (8)  | map        | introspection response |
       | rs_cnf   | TBD (41) | map        | token response         |
       \----------+----------+------------+------------------------/

          Figure 5: CBOR mappings for new parameters and claims.

7.  Requirements when using asymmetric keys

   An RS using asymmetric keys to authenticate to the client MUST NOT
   hold several different asymmetric key pairs, applicable to the same
   authentication algorithm.  For example when using DTLS, the RS MUST
   NOT hold several asymmetric key pairs applicable to the same cipher
   suite.  The reason for this restriction is that the RS has no way of
   determining which key to use before the client's identity is
   established.  Therefore authentication attempts by the RS could
   randomly fail based on which key the RS selects, unless the algorithm
   negotiation produces a unique choice of key pair for the RS.
