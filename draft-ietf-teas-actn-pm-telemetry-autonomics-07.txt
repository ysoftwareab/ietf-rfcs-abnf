Internet-Draft            VN/TE Perf Monitoring             October 2021


1.  Introduction

   The YANG [RFC7950] model in [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-vn-yang] is used to
   operate customer-driven Virtual Networks (VNs) during the computation
   of VN, its instantiation, and its life-cycle service management and
   operations.  YANG model in [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te] is used to operate
   TE-tunnels during the tunnel instantiation, and its life-cycle
   management and operations.

   The models presented in this draft allow the applications hosted by
   the customers to subscribe to and monitor their key performance data
   of their interest on the level of VN [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-vn-yang] or
   TE-tunnel [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te].  The key characteristic of the
   models presented in this document is a top-down programmability that
   allows the applications hosted by the customers to subscribe to and
   monitor key performance data of their interest and autonomic scaling
   intent mechanism on the level of VN as well as TE-tunnel.

   According to the classification of [RFC8309], the YANG data models
   presented in this document can be classified as customer service
   models.  These can be mapped to the CMI (Customer Network Controller
   (CNC)- Multi-Domain Service Coordinator (MSDC) interface) of ACTN
   [RFC8453].

   [RFC8233] describes key network performance data to be considered for
   end-to-end path computation in TE networks.  The services provided
   can be optimized to meet the requirements (such as traffic patterns,
   quality, and reliability) of the applications hosted by the
   customers.

   This document provides YANG data models generically applicable to any
   VN/TE-Tunnel service clients to provide an ability to program their
   customized performance monitoring subscription and publication data
   models and automatic scaling in/out intent data models.  These models
   can be utilized by a client network controller to initiate the
   capabilities to a TE network controller communicating with the client
   controller via a NETCONF [RFC8341] or a RESTCONF [RFC8040] interface.

   The term performance monitoring is used in this document in a
   different from how the term has been used in TE networks for many
   years.  Performance monitoring in this document refers to
   subscription and publication of streaming telemetry data.
   Subscription is initiated by the client (e.g., CNC) while publication
   is provided by the network (e.g., MDSC/Provisioning Network
   Controller (PNC)) based on the client's subscription.  As the scope
   of performance monitoring in this document is telemetry data on the
   level of a client's VN or TE-tunnel, the entity interfacing to the
   client (e.g., MDSC) has to provide VN or TE-tunnel level information.

Internet-Draft            VN/TE Perf Monitoring             October 2021


   This requires the controller to have the capability to derive VN or
   TE-tunnel level performance data based on lower-level data collected
   via PM counters in the Network Elements (NE).  How the controller
   entity derives such customized level data (i.e., VN or TE-tunnel
   level) is out of the scope of this document.

   The data model includes configuration and state data according to the
   Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) [RFC8342].

1.1.  Terminology

   Refer to [RFC8453], [RFC7926], and [RFC8309] for the key terms used
   in this document.

   Scaling: This refers to the network's ability to re-shape its own
   resources.  "Scale out" refers to improve network performance by
   increasing the allocated resources, while "scale in" refers to
   decreasing the allocated resources, typically because the existing
   resources are unnecessary.

   Scaling Intent: Scaling intent is used to declare scaling conditions.
   Specifically, scaling intent refers to how the client programs or
   configures conditions that will be applied to their key performance
   data to trigger either scaling out or scaling in.  Various conditions
   can be set for scaling intent on either VN or TE-tunnel level.

   Network Autonomics: This refers to the network automation capability
   that allows a client to initiate scaling intent mechanisms and
   provides the client with the status of the adjusted network resources
   based on the client's scaling intent in an automated fashion.

1.2.  Tree Diagram

   A simplified graphical representation of the data model is used in
   Section 4 and Section 6 of this document.  The meaning of the symbols
   in these diagrams is defined in [RFC8340].

1.3.  Prefixes in Data Node Names

   In this document, names of data nodes and other data model objects
   are prefixed using the standard prefix associated with the
   corresponding YANG imported modules, as shown in Table 1.

   *  Network traffic monitoring is important to facilitate automatic
      discovery of the imbalance of network traffic, and initiate
      network optimization, thus helping the network operator or the
      virtual network service provider to use the network more
      efficiently and save Capital Expense (CAPEX) and Operating Expense
      (OPEX).

   *  Customer services have various Service Level Agreement (SLA)
      requirements, such as service availability, latency, jitter,
      packet loss rate, Bit Error Rate (BER), etc.  The TE network can
      satisfy service availability and BER requirements by providing
      different protection and restoration mechanisms.  However, for
      other SLA requirements, there are no such mechanisms.  In order to
      provide high quality services according to the customer SLA, one
      possible solution is to measure the SLA related performance
      parameters, and dynamically provision and optimize services based
      on the performance monitoring results.

   *  Performance monitoring in a large scale network could generate a
      huge amount of performance information.  Therefore, the
      appropriate way to deliver the information at the client and
      network interfaces should be carefully considered.

3.  Design of the Data Models

   This document describes two YANG models:

   (i)    TE Telemetry Model which provides the TE-Tunnel level of

          performance monitoring mechanism and scaling intent mechanism
          that allows scale in/out programming by the customer.  (See
          Section 3.1 & Section 7.1 for details).

   (ii)   VN Telemetry Model which provides the VN level of the

          aggregated performance monitoring mechanism and scaling intent
          mechanism that allows scale in/out programming by the customer
          (See Section 3.2 & Section 7.2 for details).

3.1.  TE Telemetry Model

   This model describes the performance telemetry for the TE tunnel.
   The telemetry data is augmented to the TE tunnel.  This model also
   allows autonomic traffic engineering scaling intent configuration
   mechanism on the TE-tunnel level.  Various conditions can be set for
   auto-scaling based on the telemetry data (See Section 5 for details)

   As shown in Figure 2, the TE Telemetry Model augments the TE-Tunnel
   Model to enhance TE performance monitoring capability.  This
   monitoring capability will facilitate re-optimization and
   reconfiguration of TE tunnels based on the performance monitoring
   data collected via the TE Telemetry YANG model.

                 Figure 2: TE Telemetry Model Relationship

3.2.  VN Telemetry Model

   As shown in Figure 3, the VN Telemetry Model augments the basic VN
   model to enhance VN monitoring capability.  This monitoring
   capability will facilitate re-optimization and reconfiguration of VNs
   based on the performance monitoring data collected via the VN
   Telemetry YANG model.  This model also imports TE telemetry model to
   reuse the groupings.

                 Figure 3: VN Telemetry Model Relationships

   This model describes the performance telemetry for the VN model.  The
   telemetry data is augmented to the VN model at the VN Level as well
   as at the individual VN member level.  This model also allows
   autonomic traffic engineering scaling intent configuration mechanism
   on the VN level.  Scale in/out criteria might be used for network
   autonomics in order for the controller to react to a certain set of
   variations in monitored parameters (See Section 4 for illustrations).

   Moreover, this model also provides a mechanism to define aggregated
   VN telemetry parameters as a grouping of underlying VN-member level
   telemetry parameters.  This is unique to the VN model as a VN is made
   up of multiple VN-members and further each VN-member could be set
   across multiple TE tunnels.  Grouping operation (such as maximum,
   mean) could be set at the time of configuration.  For example, if
   "maximum" grouping operation is used for delay at the VN level, the
   VN telemetry data is reported as the maximum of {delay_vn_member_1,
   delay_vn_member_2,..  delay_vn_member_N}. Thus, this telemetry
   aggregation mechanism allows the aggregation (or grouping) of a
   certain common set of telemetry values under a grouping operation.
   This can also be done at the VN-member level to suggest how the end-
   to-end (E2E) telemetry be inferred from the per domain tunnels
   created and monitored by PNCs.  The Figure 4 provides an example
   interaction.

3.3.  VPN Service Performance Monitoring

   The YANG model in [I-D.ietf-opsawg-yang-vpn-service-pm] provides
   network performance monitoring (PM) and VPN service performance
   monitoring that can be used to monitor and manage network performance
   on the topology at higher layer or the service topology between VPN
   sites.  Thus the YANG models in this document could be used along
   side with ietf-network-vpn-pm to understand and correlate the
   performance monitoring at the VPN service and the underlying TE
   level.

4.  Autonomic Scaling Intent Mechanism

   The scaling intent configuration mechanism allows the client to
   configure automatic scale-in and scale-out mechanisms on both the TE-
   tunnel and the VN level.  Various conditions can be set for auto-
   scaling based on the PM telemetry data.

   There are a number of parameters involved in the mechanism:

   *  scale-out-intent or scale-in-intent: whether to scale-out or
      scale-in.

   *  performance-type: performance metric type (e.g., one-way-delay,
      one-way-delay-min, one-way-delay-max, two-way-delay, two-way-
      delay-min, two-way-delay-max, utilized bandwidth, etc.)

   *  threshold-value: the threshold value for a certain performance-
      type that triggers scale-in or scale-out.

   *  scaling-operation-type: in case where scaling condition can be set
      with one or more performance types, then scaling-operation-type
      (AND, OR, MIN, MAX, etc.) is applied to these selected performance
      types and its threshold values.

   *  Threshold-time: the duration for which the criteria needs to hold
      true.

   *  Cooldown-time: the duration after a scaling action has been
      triggered, for which there will be no further operation.

   The tree in Figure 5 is a part of ietf-te-telemetry tree whose model
   is presented in full detail in Sections 6 & 7.

                        Figure 5: The scaling intent

   Let's say the client wants to set the scaling out operation based on
   two performance-types (e.g., two-way-delay and utilized-bandwidth for
   a te-tunnel), it can be done as follows:

   *  Set Threshold-time: x (sec) (duration for which the criteria must
      hold true)

   *  Set Cooldown-time: y (sec) (the duration after a scaling action
      has been triggered, for which there will be no further operation)

   *  Set AND for the scale-out-operation-type

   In the scaling condition's list, the following two components can be
   set:

   List 1: Scaling Condition for Two-way-delay

   *  performance type: Two-way-delay

   *  threshold-value: z milli-seconds

   List 2: Scaling Condition for Utilized bandwidth

   *  performance type: Utilized bandwidth

   *  threshold-value: w megabytes

5.  Notification

   This model does not define specific notifications.  To enable
   notifications, the mechanism defined in [RFC8641] and [RFC8640] can
   be used.  This mechanism currently allows the user to:

   *  Subscribe to notifications on a per client basis.

   *  Specify subtree filters or xpath filters so that only interested
      contents will be sent.

   *  Specify either periodic or on-demand notifications.

5.1.  YANG Push Subscription Examples

   [RFC8641] allows subscriber applications to request a continuous,
   customized stream of updates from a YANG datastore.

   The example in Figure 6 shows the way for a client to subscribe to
   the telemetry information for a particular tunnel (Tunnel1).  The
   telemetry parameter that the client is interested in is one-way-
   delay.

8.  Security Considerations

   The YANG modules specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees with the write
   operation that can be exploited to impact the network monitoring.  An
   incorrect condition could cause frequent scaling operation to be
   executed causing harm to the network:

   *  /te:te/te:tunnels/te:tunnel/te-scaling-intent/scale-in-intent

   *  /te:te/te:tunnels/te:tunnel/te-scaling-intent/scale-out-intent

   *  /vn:virtual-network/vn:vn/vn-scaling-intent/scale-in-intent

Internet-Draft            VN/TE Perf Monitoring             October 2021


   *  /vn:virtual-network/vn:vn/vn-scaling-intent/scale-out-intent

   Further, following are the subtrees with the write operation that can
   be exploited by setting an incorrect grouping operation for the VN
   operation impacting the network monitoring:

   *  /vn:virtual-network/vn:vn/vn-telemetry/operation

   *  /vn:virtual-network/vn:vn/vn:vn-member/vn-member-telemetry/
      operation

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees with the
   read operations that can be exploited to learn real-time (and
   sensitive) telemetry information about the TE tunnels and VN:

   *  /te:te/te:tunnels/te:tunnel/te-telemetry

   *  /vn:virtual-network/vn:vn/vn-telemetry

   *  /vn:virtual-network/vn:vn/vn:vn-member/vn-member-telemetry
