Abstract

     The document specifies considerations for mobility support in NAT-
     PT (RFC-2766) [1].



1. Introduction

     NAT-PT (RFC-2766) enables end-nodes in IPv6 realm to communicate
     with end-nodes in IPv4 realm and vice versa.  RFC-2766 [1] needs
     some fixes and/or applicability statements.  Among them, there
     exists considerations in NAT-PT [1] when IPv6 end-nodes move.  3GPP
     drafts [2, 3] mention that there is a need for transltors, such as
     NAT-PT, but in this case, current RFC-2766 [1] does not support
     IPv6 mobile nodes. The document specifies considerations for
     mobility support in NAT-PT (RFC-2766)[1].

2. Issues with mobility support in NAT-PT


2.1 Movement of end-nodes in IPv6 realm (IPv6-MNs)

     When IPv6 end-nodes move, there are issues should be considered in
     RFC-2766. Basically, since mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) [4] provides route
     optimization, NAT-PT box must update its associated address mapping
     entries. As well, NAT-PT box needs appropriate handling of controls
     such as RR (Return Routability), BU (Binding Update), etc.

                        IPv6 realm


2.2 Movement of end-nodes in IPv4 realm (IPv4-MNs)

     Obviously, there is no issue when IPv4 end-nodes move, since mobile
     IPv4 (MIPv4) ][5] uses tunneling.


3. Mobility support in NAT-PT box

     This section describes the case that an IPv6-MN moves from home
     network to other network in the same IPv6 island.

     Main consideration is that NAT-PT box does all of MIPv6

     how NAT-PT box works in this situation.

     In the example below, the following notations will be used.
