                Transport Network aware Mobility for 5G
                   draft-clt-dmm-tn-aware-mobility-08

Abstract

   This document specifies a framework and mapping from slices in 5G
   mobile systems to transport slices in IP and Layer 2 transport
   networks.  Slices in 5G systems are characterized by latency bounds,
   reservation guarantees, jitter, data rates, availability, mobility
   speed, usage density, criticality and priority.  These
   characteristics should be mapped to the transport network slice
   characteristics that include bandwidth, latency and criteria such as
   isolation, directionality and disjoint routes.  Mobile slice criteria
   need to be mapped to the appropriate transport slice and capabilities
   offered in backhaul, midhaul and fronthaul connectivity segments
   between radio side network functions and user plane function
   (gateway).

   This document describes how mobile network functions map its slice
   criteria to identifiers in IP packets that transport network segments
   use to grant transport layer services during UE mobility scenarios.
   Applicability of this framework and underlying transport networks,
   which can enable different slice properties is also discussed.  This
   is based on mapping between mobile and transport underlays (L2,
   Segment Routing, IPv6, MPLS and IPv4).

1.  Introduction

   The 3GPP architecture for 5GS is defined in [TS.23.501-3GPP],
   [TS.23.502-3GPP] and [TS.23.503-3GPP].  The architecture defines a
   comprehensive set of functions for access mobility, session handling
   and related functions for subscription management, authentication and
   policy among others.  These network functions (NF) are defined using
   a service-based architecture (SBA) that allows NFs to expose their
   functions via an API and common service framework.

   UPFs are the data forwarding entities in the 5GC architecture.  The
   architecture allows the placement of Branching Point (BP) and Uplink
   Classifier (ULCL) UPFs closer to the access network (5G-AN).  The 5G-
   AN can be a radio access network or any non-3GPP access network, for
   example, WLAN.  The IP address is anchored by a PDU session anchor
   UPF (PSA UPF). 3GPP slicing and RAN aspects are further described in
   Appendix A.1.

   5GS allows more than one UPF on the path for a PDU (Protocol Data
   Unit) session that provides various functionality including session
   anchoring, uplink classification and branching point for a multihomed
   IPv6 PDU session.  The interface between the BP/ULCL UPF and the PSA
   UPF is called N9 [TS.23.501-3GPP].  3GPP has adopted GTP-U for the N9
   and N3 interface between the various UPF instances and the (R)AN and
   also for the F1-U interface between the DU and the CU in the RAN.
   3GPP has specified control and user plane aspects in [TS.23.501-3GPP]
   to provide slice and QoS support.  3GPP has defined three broad slice
   types to cover enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) communications,
   ultra-reliable low latency communications(URLLC) and massive internet
   of things (mIoT).  ATIS [ATIS075] has defined an additional slice
   type for V2X services.  There may be multiple instances of a slice
   type to satisfy some characteristics like isolation.  The slice
   details in 3GPP, ATIS or NGMN do not specify how slice
   characteristics for QoS, hard /soft isolation, protection and other

   aspects should be satisfied in IP transport networks.  This is
   explored further in this document.

1.1.  Problem Statement

   5GS defines network slicing as one of the core capability of 5GC with
   slice awareness from Radio and 5G Core (5GC) network.  The 5G System
   (5GS) as defined, does not consider the resources and functionalities
   needed from transport network for the selection of UPF.  This is seen
   as independent functionality and currently not part of 5GS.

   However, the lack of underlying Transport Network (TN) awareness may
   lead to selection of sub-optimal UPF(s) and/or 5G-AN during various
   procedures in 5GS (e.g., session establishment and various mobility
   scenarios).  Meeting the specific slice characteristics on the F1-U,
   N3, N9 interfaces depends on the IP transport underlay providing
   these resources and capabilities.  This could also lead to the
   inability in meeting SLAs for real-time, mission-critical or latency
   sensitive services.

   The 5GS provides slices to its clients (UEs).  The UE's PDU session
   spans the access network (radio network including the F1-U) and N3
   and N9 transport segments which have an IP transport underlay.  The
   5G operator needs to obtain slice capability from the IP transport
   provider.  Several UE sessions that match a slice may be mapped to an
   IP transport segment.  Thus there needs to be a mapping between the
   slice capability offered to the UE (S-NSSAI) and what is provided by
   the IP transport.

1.2.  Solution Approach

   This document specifies an approach to fulfil the needs of 5GS to
   transport user plane traffic from 5G-AN to UPF in an optimized
   fashion.  This is done by, keeping establishment and mobility
   procedures aware of underlying transport network along with slicing
   requirements.

   Section 2 describes in detail on how TN aware mobility can be built
   irrespective of underlying TN technology used.  How other IETF TE
   technologies applicable for this draft is specified in Section 3.2.

2.  Transport and Slice aware Mobility in 5G Networks

   3GPP architecture [TS.23.501-3GPP], [TS.23.502-3GPP] describe slicing
   in 5GS.  However, the application of 5GS slices in transport network
   for backhaul, mid-haul and front haul are not explicitly covered.  To
   support specific characteristics in backhaul (N3, N9), mid-haul (F1)
   and front haul, it is necessary to map and provision corresponding
   resources in the transport domain.  This section describes how to
   provision the mapping information in transport network and apply it
   so that user plane packets can be provided the transport resources
   (QoS, isolation, protection, etc.) expected by the 5GS slices.

2.1.  Backhaul and Mid-Haul Transport Network

   Figure 1 depicts IP Xhaul network with SDN-C and PE (Provider Edge)
   routers provide IP transport service to 5GS user plane entities 5G-AN
   (e.g. gNB) and UPF.  5GS architecture with high level management,
   control and user plane entities and its interaction with the IP
   transport plane is shown here.  The slice capability required in IP
   transport networks is estimated and provisioned by the functionality
   as specified in Section 2.4 (TNF) with support from various other
   control plane functions such as the Network Data Analytics Function
   (NWDAF), Network Function Repository Function (NRF) and Policy
   Control Function (PCF).  The TNF is only a logical function that
   maybe realized in a 3GPP management function such as Network Slice
   Selection Management Function (NSSMF) defined in [TS.28.533-3GPP].

Internet-Draft   Transport Network aware Mobility for 5G   November 2020


   The TNF requests the SDN-C to provision the IP XHaul network using
   ACTN [RFC8453].

   The 5G management plane in Figure 1 interacts with the 5G control
   plane - the 5GC (5G Core), gNB-CU (5G NodeB Centralized Unit) and
   gNB-DU (5G Node B Distributed Unit).  Non-access stratum (NAS)
   signaling from the UE for session management, mobility is handled by
   the 5GC.  When a UE initiates session establishment, it indicates the
   desired slice type in the S-NSSAI (Specific Network Slice Selection
   Assistance Information) field.  The AMF uses the S-NSSAI, other
   subscription information and configuration in the NSSF to select the
   appropriate SMF and the SMF in turn selects UPFs (User Plane
   Functions) that are able to provide the specified slice resources and
   capabilities.

   The AMF, SMF, NSSF, PCF, NRF, NWDAF and other control functions in
   5GC are described in [TS.23.501-3GPP] Some of the slice capabilities
   along the user plane path between the (R)AN and UPFs (F1-U, N3, N9
   segments) such as a low latency path, jitter, protection and priority
   needs these to be provided by the IP transport network.

   The 5G user plane from UE to DN (Data Network) includes a mid-haul
   segment (F1-U between gNB DU(UP), gNB CU(UP)) and backhaul (N3
   between gNB - UPF; N9 between UPFs).  If the RAN uses lower layer
   split architecture as specified by O-RAN alliance, then the user
   plane path from UE to DN also includes the fronthaul interface.  The
   fronthaul interface carries the radio frames in the form of In-phase
   (I) and Quadrature (Q) samples using eCPRI encapsulation over
   Ethernet or UDP over IP.

   The N3, N9 and F1 user planes use GTP-U [TS.29.281-3GPP] to transport
   UE PDUs (IPv4, IPv6, IPv4v6, Ethernet or Unstructured).  For the
   front haul described further in Section 2.2, an Ethernet transport
   with VLANs can be expected to be the case in many deployments.

   Figure 1 also depicts the PE router, where transport paths are
   initiated/terminated can be deployed separately with UPF or both
   functionalities can be in the same node.  The TNF provisions this in
   the SDN-C of the IP XHaul network using ACTN [RFC8453].  When a GTP
   encapsulated user packet from the (R)AN (gNB) or UPF with the slice
   information traverses the F1-U/N3/N9 segment, the PE router of the IP
   transport underlay can inspect the slice information and provide the
   provisioned capabilities.  This is elaborated further in Section 2.5.

2.2.  Front Haul Transport Network

   The O-RAN Alliance has specified the fronthaul interface between the
   O-RU and the O-DU in [ORAN-WG4.CUS-O-RAN].  The radio layer
   information, in the form of In-phase (I) and Quadrature (Q) samples
   are transported using Enhanced Common Public Radio Interface (eCPRI)
   framing over Ethernet or UDP.  On the Ethernet based fronthaul
   interface, the slice information is carried in the Ethernet header
   through the VLAN tags.  The Ethernet switches in the fronthaul
   transport network can inspect the slice information (VLAN tag) in the
   Ethernet header and provide the provisioned capabilities.  The
   mapping of I and Q samples of different radio resources (radio
   resource blocks or carriers etc.,.) to different slices and to their
   respective VLAN tags on the fronthaul interface is controlled by the
   O-RAN fronthaul C-Plane and M-Plane interfaces.  On UDP based
   fronthaul interface, the slice information is carried in the IP or
   UDP header.  The PE routers of the fronthaul transport network can
   inspect the slice information in the IP or UDP header and provide the
   provisioned capabilities.  The fronthaul transport network is latency
   and jitter sensitive.  The provisioned slice capabilities in the
   fronthaul transport network MUST take care of the latency and jitter
   budgets of the specific slice for the fronthaul interface.  The
   provisioning of the fronthaul transport network is handled by the
   SDN-C pertaining to the fronthaul transport.

2.3.  Mobile Transport Network Context (MTNC) and Scalability

   The MTNC represents a slice, QoS configuration for a transport path
   between two 3GPP user plane functions.  The Mobile-Transport Network
   Context Identifier (MTNC-ID) is generated by the TNF to be unique for
   each path and per traffic class (including QoS and slice aspects).
   Thus, there may be more than one MTNC-ID for the same QoS and path if
   there is a need to provide isolation (slice) of the traffic.  It
   should be noted that MTNC are per class/path and not per user session
   (nor is it per data path entity).  The MTNC-IDs are configured by the
   TNF to be unique within a provisioning domain.

   Since the MTNC-IDs are not generated per user flow or session, there
   is no need for unique MTNC-IDs per flow/session.  In addition, since
   the traffic estimation not performed at the time of session
   establishment, there is no provisioning delay experienced during
   session setup.  The MTNC-ID space scales as a square of the number
   sites between which 3GPP user plane functions require paths.  If
   there are T traffic classes across N sites, the number of MTNC-IDs in
   a fully meshed network is (N*(N-1)/2) * T.  For example, if there are
   3 traffic classes between 25 sites, there would be at most 900 MTNC-
   IDs required.  Multiple slices for the same QoS class that need to be

   fully isolated, will add to the MTNC provisioning.  An MTNC-ID space
   of 16 bits (65K+ identifiers) can be expected to be sufficient.

2.4.  Transport Network Function (TNF)

   Figure 1 shows a view of the functions and interfaces for
   provisioning the MTNC-IDs.  The focus is on provisioning between the
   3GPP management plane (NSSMF), transport network (SDN-C) and carrying
   the MTNC-IDs in PDU packets for the transport network to grant the
   provisioned resources.

   In Figure 1, the TNF (logical functionality within the NSSMF)
   requests the SDN-C in the transport domain to program the TE path
   using ACTN [RFC8453].  The SDN-C programs the Provider Edge (PE)
   routers and internal routers according to the underlay transport
   technology (e.g., MPLS, SR, PPR).  The PE router inspects incoming
   PDU data packets for the UDP SRC port which mirrors the MTNC-ID,
   classifies and provides the VN service provisioned across the
   transport network.

   The detailed mechanisms by which the NSSMF provides the MTNC-IDs to
   the control plane and user plane functions are for 3GPP to specify.
   Two possible options are outlined below for completeness.  The NSSMF
   may provide the MTNC-IDs to the 3GPP control plane by either
   providing it to the Session Management Function (SMF), and the SMF in
   turn provisions the user plane functions (UP-NF1, UP-NF2) during PDU
   session setup.  Alternatively, the user plane functions may request
   the MTNC-IDs directly from the TNF/NSSMF.  Figure 1 shows the case
   where user plane entities request the TNF/NSSMF to translate the
   Request and get the MTNC-ID.  Another alternative is for the TNF to
   provide a mapping of the 3GPP Network Instance Identifier, described
   in Section 2.7 and the MTNC-ID to the user plane entities via
   configuration.

   The TNF should be seen as a logical entity that can be part of NSSMF
   in the 3GPP management plane [TS.28.533-3GPP].  The NSSMF may use
   network configuration, policies, history, heuristics or some
   combination of these to derive traffic estimates that the TNF would
   use.  How these estimates are derived are not in the scope of this
   document.  The focus here is only in terms of how the TNF and SDN-C
   are programmed given that slice and QoS characteristics across a
   transport path can be represented by an MTNC-ID.  The TNF requests
   the SDN-C in the transport network to provision paths in the
   transport domain based on the MTNC-ID.  The TNF is capable of
   providing the MTNC-ID provisioned to control and user plane functions
   in the 3GPP domain.  Detailed mechanisms for programming the MTNC-ID
   should be part of the 3GPP specifications.

2.5.  Transport Provisioning

   Functionality of transport provisioning for an engineered IP
   transport that supports 3GPP slicing and QoS requirements in
   [TS.23.501-3GPP] is described in this section.

   During a PDU session setup, the AMF using input from the NSSF selects
   a network slice and SMF.  The SMF with user policy from Policy
   Control Function (PCF) sets 5QI (QoS parameters) and the UPF on the
   path of the PDU session.  While QoS and slice selection for the PDU
   session can be applied across the 3GPP control and user plane
   functions as outlined in Section 2, the IP transport underlay across
   F1-U, N3 and N9 segments do not have enough information to apply the
   resource constraints represented by the slicing and QoS
   classification.  Current guidelines for interconnection with
   transport networks [IR.34-GSMA] provide an application mapping into
   DSCP.  However, these recommendations do not take into consideration
   other aspects in slicing like isolation, protection and replication.

   IP transport networks have their own slice and QoS configuration
   based on domain policies and the underlying network capability.
   Transport networks can enter into an agreement for virtual network
   services (VNS) with client domains using the ACTN [RFC8453]
   framework.  An IP transport network may provide such slice instances
   to mobile network operators, CDN providers or enterprises for
   example.  The 3GPP mobile network, on the other hand, defines a slice
   instance for UEs as are the mobile operator's 'clients'.  The Network
   Slice Selection Management Function (NSSMF) [TS 28.533] that
   interacts with a TN controller like an SDN-C (that is out of scope of
   3GPP).

   The ACTN VN service can be used across the IP transport networks to
   provision and map the slice instance and QoS of the 3GPP domain to
   the IP transport domain.  An abstraction that represents QoS and
   slice instance in the mobile domain and mapped to ACTN VN service in
   the transport domain is represented here as MTNC-IDs.  Details of how
   the MTNC-IDs are derived are up to functions that can estimate the
   level of traffic demand.

   The 3GPP network/5GS provides slices instances to its clients (UE)
   that include resources for radio and mobile core segments.  The UE's
   PDU session spans the access network (radio) and F1-U/N3/N9 transport
   segments which have an IP transport underlay.  The 5G operator needs
   to obtain slice capability from the IP transport provider since these
   resources are not seen by the 5GS.  Several UE sessions that match a
   slice may be mapped to an IP transport segment.  Thus, there needs to
   be a mapping between the slice capability offered to the UE (NSSAI)
   and what is provided by the IP transport.

Internet-Draft   Transport Network aware Mobility for 5G   November 2020


   When the 3GPP user plane function (5G-AN, UPF) does not terminate the
   transport underlay protocol (e.g., MPLS), it needs to be carried in
   the IP protocol header from end-to-end of the mobile transport
   connection (N3, N9).  [I-D.ietf-dmm-5g-uplane-analysis] discusses
   these scenarios in detail.

2.6.  MTNC-ID in the Data Packet

   When the 3GPP user plane function (5G-AN, UPF) and transport provider
   edge is on different nodes, the PE router needs to have the means by
   which to classify the PDU packet.  The mapping information is
   provisioned between the 5G provider and IP transport network and
   corresponding information should be carried in each IP packet on the
   F1-U, N3, N9 interface.  To allow the IP transport edge nodes to
   inspect the transport context information efficiently, it should be
   carried in an IP header field that is easy to inspect.  It may be
   noted that the F1-U, N3 and N9 interfaces in 5GS are IP interfaces.
   Thus, Layer 2 alternatives such as VLAN will fail if there are
   multiple L2 networks on the F1-U or N3 or N9 path.  GTP (F1-U, N3, N9
   encapsulation header) field extensions offer a possibility, however
   these extensions are hard for a transport edge router to parse
   efficiently on a per packet basis.  Other IP header fields like DSCP
   are not suitable as it only conveys the QoS aspects (but not other
   aspects like isolation, protection, etc.)

   IPv6 extension headers like SRv6 may be options to carry the MTNC-ID
   when such mechanism is a viable (if complete transport network is
   IPv6 based).  To minimise the protocol changes are required and make
   this underlay transport independent (IPv4/IPv6/MPLS/L2), an option is
   to provision a mapping of MTNC-ID to a UDP port range of the GTP
   encapsulated user packet.  A simple mapping table between the MTNC-ID
   and the source UDP port number can be configured to ensure that ECMP
   /load balancing is not affected adversely by encoding the UDP source
   port with an MTNC-ID mapping.  This mapping is configured in 3GPP
   user plane functions (5G-AN, UPF) and Provider Edge (PE) Routers that
   process MTNC-IDs.

   PE routers can thus provision a policy based on the source UDP port
   number (which reflects the mapped MTNC-ID) to underlying transport
   path and then deliver the QoS/slice resource provisioned in the
   transport network.  The source UDP port that is encoded is the outer
   IP (corresponding to GTP header) while the inner IP packet (UE
   payload) is unaltered.  The source UDP port is encoded by the node
   that creates the GTP-U encapsulation and therefore, this mechanism
   has no impact to UDP checksum calculations.

   3GPP network operators may use IPSec gateways (SEG) to secure packets
   between two sites - for example over an F1-U, N3 or N9 segment.  The



Chunduri, et al.           Expires May 6, 2021                 [Page 12]

Internet-Draft   Transport Network aware Mobility for 5G   November 2020


   MTNC identifier in the GTP-U packet should be in the outer IP source
   port even after IPSec encryption for PE transport routers to inspect
   and provide the level of service provisioned.  Tunnel mode - which is
   the case for SEG/IPSec gateways - adds an outer IP header in both AH
   (Authenticated Header) and ESP (Encapsulated Security Payload) modes.
   The GTP-U / UDP source port with encoded MTNC identifier should be
   copied to the IPSec tunnel ESP header.  One option is to use 16 bits
   from the SPI field of the ESP header to encode the MTNC identifier
   and use the remaining 16 bits in SPI field to identify an SA.  Load
   balancing entropy for ECMP will not be affected as the MTNC encoding
   mechanism already accounts for this.

   If the RAN uses O-RAN lower layer split architecture, then a
   fronthaul network is involved.  On an Ethernet based fronthaul
   transport network, VLAN tag may be an option to carry the MTNC-ID.
   The VLAN ID provides a 12 bit space and is sufficient to support up
   to 4096 slices on the fronthaul transport network.  The mapping of
   fronthaul traffic to corresponding network slice is based on the
   radio resource for which the fronthaul carries the I and Q samples.
   The mapping of fronthaul traffic to the VLAN tag corresponding to the
   network slice is specified in Section 2.2.  On UDP based fronthaul
   transport network, the UDP source port can be used to carry the MTNC-
   ID.

2.7.  Functionality for E2E Management

   With the TNF functionality in 5GS Service Based Interface, the
   following additional functionalities are required for end-2-end slice
   management including the transport network:

   o  The Specific Network Slice Selection Assistance Information
      (S-NSSAI) of PDU session SHOULD be mapped to the assigned
      transport VPN and the TE path information for that slice.

   o  For transport slice assignment for various SSTs (eMBB, URLLC,
      MIoT) corresponding underlay paths need to be created and
      monitored from each transport end point (CSR and PE@UPF).

   o  During PDU session creation, apart from radio and 5GC resources,
      transport network resources needed to be verified matching the
      characteristics of the PDU session traffic type.

   o  The TNF MUST provide an API that takes as input the source and
      destination 3GPP user plane element address, required bandwidth,
      latency and jitter characteristics between those user plane
      elements and returns as output a particular TE path's identifier,
      that satisfies the requested requirements.

Internet-Draft   Transport Network aware Mobility for 5G   November 2020


   o  Mapping of PDU session parameters to underlay SST paths need to be
      done.  One way to do this to let the SMF install a Forwarding
      Action Rule (FAR) in the UPF via N4 with the FAR pointing to a
      "Network Instance" in the UPF.  A "Network Instance" is a logical
      identifier for an underlying network.  The "Network Instance"
      pointed by the FAR can be mapped to a transport path (through L2/
      L3 VPN).  FARs are associated with Packet Detection Rule (PDR).
      PDRs are used to classify packets in the uplink (UL) and the
      downlink (DL) direction.  For UL procedures specified in
      Section 2.5, Section 2.6 can be used for classifying a packet
      belonging to a particular slice characteristic.  For DL, at a PSA
      UPF, the UE IP address is used to identify the PDU session, and
      hence the slice a packet belongs to and the IP 5 tuple can be used
      for identifying the flow and QoS characteristics to be applied on
      the packet at UPF.  If a PE is not co-located at the UPF then
      mapping to the underlying TE paths at PE happens based on the
      encapsulated GTP-U packet as specified in Section 2.6.

   o  In some SSC modes [I-D.chunduri-dmm-5g-mobility-with-ppr], if
      segmented path (CSR to PE@staging/ULCL/BP-UPF to PE@anchor-point-
      UPF) is needed, then corresponding path characteristics MUST be
      used.  This includes a path from CSR to PE@UL-CL/BP UPF
      [TS.23.501-3GPP] and UL-CL/BP UPF to eventual UPF access to DN.

   o  Continuous monitoring of the underlying transport path
      characteristics should be enabled at the endpoints (technologies
      for monitoring depends traffic engineering technique used as
      described in Section 3.2).  If path characteristics are degraded,
      reassignment of the paths at the endpoints should be performed.
      For all the affected PDU sessions, degraded transport paths need
      to be updated dynamically with similar alternate paths.

   o  During UE mobility event similar to 4G/LTE i.e., gNB mobility (F1
      based, Xn based or N2 based), for target gNB selection, apart from
      radio resources, transport resources MUST be factored.  This
      enables handling of all PDU sessions from the UE to target gNB and
      this require co-ordination of gNB, AMF, SMF with the TNF module.

   Integrating the TNF as part of the 5GS Service Based Interfaces,
   provides the flexibility to control the allocation of required
   characteristics from the TN during a 5GS signaling procedure (e.g.
   PDU Session Establishment).  If TNF is seen as separate and in
   management plane, this real time flexibility is lost.  Changes to
   detailed signaling to integrate the above for various 5GS procedures
   as defined in [TS.23.502-3GPP] is beyond the scope of this document.

3.  Transport Network Underlays

   Apart from the various flavors of IETF VPN technologies to share the
   transport network resources and capacity, TE capabilities in the
   underlay network is an essential component to realize the 5G TN
   requirements.  This section focuses on various transport underlay
   technologies (not exhaustive) and their applicability to realize
   Midhaul/Backhaul transport networks.  Focus is on the user/data plane
   i.e., F1-U/N3/N9 interfaces as laid out in the framework Figure 1.

3.1.  Applicability

   o  For 3 different SSTs, 3 transport TE paths can be signaled from
      any node in the transport network.  For Uplink traffic, the 5G-AN
      will choose the right underlying TE path of the UPF based on the
      S-NSSAI the PDU Session belongs to and/or the UDP Source port
      (corresponds to the MTNC-ID Section 2.5) of the GTP-U
      encapsulation header.  Similarly in the Downlink direction
      matching Transport TE Path of the 5G-AN is chosen based on the
      S-NSSAI the PDU Session belongs to.  The table below shows a
      typical mapping:

            Figure 2: Mapping of Transport Paths on F1-U/N3/N9

   o  It is possible to have a single TE Path for multiple input points
      through a MP2P TE tree structure separate in UL and DL direction.

   o  Same set of TE Paths are created uniformly across all needed 5G-
      ANs and UPFs to allow various mobility scenarios.

   o  Any modification of TE parameters of the path, replacement path
      and deleted path needed to be updated from TNF to the relevant
      ingress points.  Same information can be pushed to the NSSF, and/
      or SMF as needed.

   o  TE Paths support for native L2, IPv4 and IPv6 data/user planes
      with optional TE features are desirable in some network segments.
      As this is an underlay mechanism it can work with any overlay
      encapsulation approach including GTP-U as defined currently for
      F1-U/N3/N9 interface.

   In some E2E scenarios, security is desired granularly in the
   underlying transport network.  In such cases, there would be a need
   to have separate sub-ranges under each SST to provide the TE path in
   preserving the security characteristics.  The UDP Source Port range

   captured in Figure 2 would be sub-divided to maintain the TE path for
   the current SSTs with the security.  The current solution doesn't
   provide any mandate on the UE traffic in selecting the type of
   security.

3.2.  Transport Network Technologies

   While there are many Software Defined Networking (SDN) approaches are
   available, this sections is not intended to list all the
   possibilities in this space but merely captures the technologies for
   various requirements discussed in this document.

   RSVP-TE [RFC3209] provides a lean transport overhead for the TE path
   for MPLS user plane.  However, it is perceived as less dynamic in
   some cases and has some provisioning overhead across all the nodes in
   N3 and N9 interface nodes.  Also, it has another drawback with
   excessive state refresh overhead across adjacent nodes and this can
   be mitigated with [RFC8370].

   SR-TE [RFC8402] does not explicitly signal bandwidth reservation or
   mechanism to guarantee latency on the nodes/links on SR path.  But SR
   allows path steering for any flow at the ingress and particular path
   for a flow can be chosen.  Some of the issues and suitability for
   mobile use plane are documented at Section 5.3 of
   [I-D.bogineni-dmm-optimized-mobile-user-plane].  However,
   [I-D.ietf-dmm-srv6-mobile-uplane] presents various options for
   optimized mobile user plane with SRv6 with or without GTP-U overhead
   along with traffic engineering capabilities.  SR-MPLS allows
   reduction of the control protocols to one IGP (without needing for
   LDP and RSVP-TE).

   Preferred Path Routing (PPR) is an integrated routing and TE
   technology and the applicability for this framework is described in
   [I-D.chunduri-dmm-5g-mobility-with-ppr].  PPR does not remove GTP-U,
   unlike some other proposals laid out in
   [I-D.bogineni-dmm-optimized-mobile-user-plane].  Instead, PPR works
   with the existing cellular user plane (GTP-U) for F1-U/N3 and N9.  In
   this scenario, PPR will only help providing TE benefits needed for 5G
   slices from transport domain perspective.  It does so for any
   underlying user/data plane used in the transport network
   (L2/IPv4/IPv6/MPLS).

   As specified with the integrated transport network function (TNF), a
   particular RSVP-TE path for MPLS or SR path for MPLS and IPv6 with
   SRH user plane or PPR with PPR-ID [I-D.chunduri-dmm-5g-mobility-with-
   ppr], can be supplied to SMF for mapping a particular PDU session to
   the transport path.

A.1.  Slicing Framework and RAN Aspects

   The 3GPP architecture defines slicing aspects where the Network Slice
   Selection Function (NSSF) assists the Access Mobility Manager (AMF)
   and Session Management Function (SMF) to assist and select the right
   entities and resources corresponding to the slice requested by the
   User Equipment (UE).  The User Equipment (UE) indicates information



Chunduri, et al.           Expires May 6, 2021                 [Page 20]

Internet-Draft   Transport Network aware Mobility for 5G   November 2020


   regarding the set of slices it wishes to connect, in the Network
   Slice Selection Assistance Information (NSSAI) field during network
   registration procedure (Attach) and the specific slice the UE wants
   to establish an IP session, in the Specific NSSAI (S-NSSAI) field
   during the session establishment procedure (PDU Session
   Establishment).  The AMF selects the right SMF and the SMF in turn
   selects the User Plane Functions (UPF) so that the QoS and
   capabilities requested can be fulfilled.

   The architecture for the Radio Access Network (RAN) is defined in
   [TS.38.300-3GPP] and [TS.38.401-3GPP].  The 5G RAN architecture
   allows disaggregation of the RAN into a Distributed Unit (DU) and a
   Centralized Unit (CU).  The CU is further split into control plane
   (CU-CP) and user plane (CU-UP).  The interface between CU-UP and the
   DU for the user plane traffic is called the F1-U and between the CU-
   CP and DU for the control plane traffic is called the F1-C.  The F1-C
   and the F1-U together are called the mid-haul interfaces.  The DU
   does not have a CP/UP split.  Apart from 3GPP, O-RAN Alliance has
   specified further disaggregation of the RAN at the lower layer
   (physical layer).  The DU is disaggregated into a ORAN DU (O-DU)
   which runs the upper part of the physical layer, MAC and RLC and the
   ORAN Radio Unit (O-RU) which runs the lower part of the physical
   layer.  The interface between the O-DU and the O-RU is called the
   Fronthaul interface and is specified in [ORAN-WG4.CUS-O-RAN].

A.2.  Slice aware Mobility: Discrete Approach

   In this approach transport network functionality from the 5G-AN to
   UPF is discrete and 5GS is not aware of the underlying transport
   network and the resources available.  Deployment specific mapping
   function is used to map the GTP-U encapsulated traffic at the 5G-AN
   (e.g. gNB) in UL and UPF in DL direction to the appropriate transport
   slice or transport Traffic Engineered (TE) paths.  These TE paths can
   be established using RSVP-TE [RFC3209] for MPLS underlay, SR
   [RFC3209] for both MPLS and IPv6 underlay or PPR [I-D.chunduri-dmm-
   5g-mobility-with-ppr] with MPLS, IPv6 with SRH, native IPv6 and
   native IPv4 underlays.

   As per [TS.23.501-3GPP] and [TS.23.502-3GPP] the SMF controls the
   user plane traffic forwarding rules in the UPF.  The UPFs have a
   concept of a "Network Instance" which logically abstracts the
   underlying transport path.  When the SMF creates the packet detection
   rules (PDR) and forwarding action rules (FAR) for a PDU session at
   the UPF, the SMF identifies the network instance through which the
   packet matching the PDR has to be forwarded.  A network instance can
   be mapped to a TE path at the UPF.  In this approach, TNF as shown in
   Figure 1 need not be part of the 5G Service Based Interface (SBI).
   Only management plane functionality is needed to create, monitor,

   manage and delete (life cycle management) the transport TE paths/
   transport slices from the 5G-AN to the UPF (on N3/N9 interfaces).
   The management plane functionality also provides the mapping of such
   TE paths to a network instance identifier to the SMF.  The SMF uses
   this mapping to install appropriate FARs in the UPF.  This approach
   provide partial integration of the transport network into 5GS with
   some benefits.

   One of the limitations of this approach is the inability of the 5GS
   procedures to know, if underlying transport resources are available
   for the traffic type being carried in PDU session before making
   certain decisions in the 5G CP.  One example scenario/decision could
   be, a target 5G-AN selection during a N2 mobility event, without
   knowing if the target 5G-AN is having a underlay transport slice
   resource for the S-NSSAI and 5QI of the PDU session.  The Integrated
   approach specified below can mitigate this.
