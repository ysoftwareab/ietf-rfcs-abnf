1.  Introduction

   The Session Description Protocol (SDP) [6] provides a general-purpose
   format for describing multimedia sessions in announcements or
   invitations.  SDP uses an entirely textual data format (the US-ASCII
   subset of UTF-8 [9]) to maximize portability among transports.  SDP
   does not define a protocol, but only the syntax to describe a
   multimedia session with sufficient information to participate in that
   session.  Session descriptions may be sent using arbitrary existing
   application protocols for transport (e.g.  FLUTE [1], SAP [13], SIP
   [14], RTSP [18], HTTP [15], email etc.).

   SDP defines two protocol identifiers that represent unreliable
   connectionless protocols.  These are RTP/AVP and UDP.  These are
   appropriate choices for multimedia streams. [16] defines protocol
   identifiers for connection-oriented reliable transports: TCP and TCP/
   TLS.  RFC 3266 [7] describes SDP support for IPv6.

   This document defines a new protocol identifier for File Delivery
   over Unidirectional Transport (FLUTE) protocol [1] and other required
   SDP attributes for initiating a FLUTE session.  The formal ABNF
   syntax [5] is used for the attributes.

3.  FLUTE Descriptors

   The FLUTE specification [1] describes the optional and required
   parameters for a FLUTE session.  This document specifies the SDP
   parameters for FLUTE sessions that can be used for the discovery of
   FLUTE download and/or service announcement sessions.

   The required parameters are:


   o  The source IP address

   o  The number of channels in the session

   o  The destination IP address and port number for each channel in the
      session

   o  The Transport Session Identifier (TSI) of the session

   o  The start time and end time of the session

   Optionally, the following parameters may be associated with the
   session:


   o  FEC Object Transmission Information

   o  Some information that tells receiver in the first place, that the
      session contains files that are of interest

   o  Bandwidth specification

   The description of these parameters in SDP is presented in the
   following sections.  Note also that "v=", "o=" and "s=" lines are
   mandatory for SDP descriptions [6].

3.1  FLUTE Protocol Identifier

   The following is the ABNF syntax for an "m=" line, as specified by
   RFC 2327 [6]:

      media-field = "m=" media SP port ["/" integer] SP
                    proto 1*(SP fmt) CRLF

   We define a new value for the "proto" sub-field: FLUTE/UDP.  The
   FLUTE/UDP protocol identifier specifies that the session being
   described will use the FLUTE [1] protocol on top of a UDP connection.
   The default behaviour of a host shall be to group all media of a

Internet-Draft          SDP Descriptors for FLUTE              June 2005


   single SDP with the FLUTE/UDP protocol identifier as belonging to the
   same single FLUTE session.  Each complete SDP session description
   will describe only one FLUTE session.

   Note, describing multiple FLUTE sessions per SDP is not considered
   useful and so is outside the scope of this document.

   The fmt list of FLUTE "m=" lines SHOULD contain a single "*"
   character, like [17].  Use of any other parameters in a FLUTE fmt
   list is out of scope of this specification. "0" is known to be used
   in the fmt list to represent the same, in a non standard way, and so
   implementors may take this into account.  An example of FLUTE/UDP
   protocol identifier is shown in section 4.

   FLUTE is a general file delivery protocol and so it is not considered
   necessary to identify a list of media types per FLUTE session or
   channel in the session description.

3.2  Source IP Address

   The Asynchronous Layered Coding (ALC) [3] and the Layered Coding
   Transport (LCT) [4] specifications require that all the channels of a
   single ALC/LCT session are from the same source IP address.  Hence,
   there MUST be exactly one source IP address per FLUTE session, and
   therefore one source IP address per each complete SDP description of
   a FLUTE session.

   The source IP address MUST be defined according to the source-filter
   attribute ("a=source-filter") [8], with the following exceptions:


   o  A source-filter attribute MUST be included in any SDP describing
      FLUTE.

   o  The source-filter attribute MUST be in the session part of the
      session description and MUST NOT be given per media.  Note, the
      requirement that there must not be more than a single source-
      filter attribute in the session part is inherited from [8].

   o  Exactly one source address is specified by this attribute.
      Exactly one source address MUST be given in an inclusive-mode
      "src-list".  Exclusive-mode MUST NOT be used.

   o  The "*" value MUST be used for the "dest-address" sub-field, even
      when the FLUTE session employs only a single channel (e.g. a
      multicast group).

   An example of the use of this attribute is:

Internet-Draft          SDP Descriptors for FLUTE              June 2005


      a=source-filter: incl IN IP6 * 2001:210:1:2:240:96FF:FE25:8EC9

   This example uses the source-filter attribute to describe an IPv6
   source address.

3.3  Transport Session Identifier

   The combination of the TSI and the source IP address identifies a
   FLUTE session.  Each TSI MUST uniquely identify a FLUTE session for a
   given source IP address during the time that the session is active
   and also for a large time before and after the active session time.
   This requirement is also specified by [4].  The TSI MUST be described
   by the "flute-tsi" attribute.  There MUST be exactly one occurrence
   of the "flute-tsi" attribute in a complete FLUTE session SDP
   description and it MUST appear at the session-level.

   The syntax for the attribute in ABNF is given below:

      flute-tsi-line = "a=flute-tsi:" tsi CRLF
      tsi = 1*DIGIT


3.4  Session Timing Parameters

   The SDP timing field "t=" [6] MUST be used to indicate the FLUTE
   session start and end times.

3.5  Channelisation Descriptors

   This section specifies the description of the channel(s) used within
   a FLUTE session.  The required parameters for channelisation
   description are:


   o  Number of channels

   o  Destination IP address and port number for channels


3.5.1  Number of Channels

   The FLUTE specification allows the use of multiple channels (e.g.
   multicast groups) to transport the files of a single FLUTE session.
   This is referred to as FLUTE session channelisation in this document.
   A FLUTE channel is equivalent to an ALC/LCT channel.  An ALC/LCT
   channel is defined by the combination of a sender and an address
   associated with the channel by the sender.  FLUTE session
   channelisation is defined according to a new SDP attribute at

Internet-Draft          SDP Descriptors for FLUTE              June 2005


   session-level as specified in this document.  Details of each channel
   are defined by SDP media-level information also described in this
   document.

   The "flute-ch" attribute describes the number of channels used by the
   source to transmit.  It MAY also be used to check that right amount
   of channel descriptions exists in the session description.  For
   example, if the value of this attribute is 2, then there should be 2
   channels specified by the "m=" line(s) and the "c=" line(s).  An
   example is given in section 4.

   The syntax for the attribute in ABNF is given below:

      flute-channel-line = "a=flute-ch:" ch CRLF
      ch = integer
      ;integer is as defined in [6].

   value is the number of channels used by the source to transmit data
   in a FLUTE session.

   In the absence of this attribute, a receiver MUST understand that
   exactly one channel is used for the FLUTE session.

3.5.2  Destination IP Address and Port Number for Channels

   SDP media-level information describes one or more channels.  The
   channel parameters MUST be given per channel and are:


   o  Destination IP address

   o  Destination port number

   The destination IP address MUST be defined according to the
   connection data field ("c=") of SDP [6].  The destination port number
   MUST be defined according to the "port" sub-field of the media
   description field ("m=") of SDP [6].

   A "c=" line can describe multiple addresses by using "number of
   addresses" sub-field, and also an "m=" line can describe multiple
   ports by using "number of ports" sub-field.  So multiple channels can
   be described by using one "c=" line and one "m=" line (slash
   notation).

   Exactly one destination port MUST be used per channel.  When more
   than one channel is used in a multicast session, it is RECOMMENDED
   that the channels are differentiated based on destination IP address,
   and channel differentiation based on destination port with the same



Mehta, et al.            Expires January 1, 2006                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft          SDP Descriptors for FLUTE              June 2005


   destination address is considered unnecessary, complex and
   potentially harmful.  When more than one channel is used in a unicast
   session, the channels have to be differentiated based on destination
   ports.

   In the case (always with a unicast session) where the same
   destination IP address is used for all the channels of the session
   and only the destination port number differentiates channels, the
   destination IP address MAY be given by the connection data field at
   session-level for all channels (if so, the connection data field MUST
   NOT be used at media-level).

   In the case where each channel have different destination IP address,
   the destination IP addresses MUST be given at media-level, i.e.
   following an "m=" line.

   The sequence of multiple channels MUST be determined by the order in
   which their media descriptions are defined in the session description
   (i.e. the first media description gives the first channel in the
   sequence).  In the case of the slash notation usage for specifying
   multiple destination addresses or ports, the order of the channel
   sequence MUST be lowest value first and highest last; and in the case
   of slash notation for both destination address and port of a media-
   level description the channel sequence MUST be from the lowest
   address value and incremented through the range.

   Also we need to indicate the presence of a FLUTE session on a certain
   channel.  This is done by using the "m=" line in the SDP description
   as shown in the following example:

      m=application 12345 FLUTE/UDP *
      c=IN IP6 FF1E:03AD::7F2E:172A:1E24

   In the above SDP attributes, the "m=" line indicates the media used
   and the "c=" line together with "m=" line's "port" sub-field
   indicates the corresponding channel's address and port respectively.
   Thus, in the above example, the media is transported on a channel
   that uses FLUTE over UDP.  Further, the "c=" line indicates the
   channel's address, which, in this case, is an IPv6 address, and "m="
   line indicates the channel's port (12345).

3.6  FEC Object Transmission Information

   An SDP description for a FLUTE session MAY include FEC Object
   Transmission Information (FEC-OTI) [12].  FEC parameters can be
   placed either at session-level or at media-level, although it is
   RECOMMENDED to place them at session-level.  If FEC declarations on
   both session and media level use the same reference number (fec-ref)



Mehta, et al.            Expires January 1, 2006                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft          SDP Descriptors for FLUTE              June 2005


   then the media level declaration takes precedence for that media
   component.  FEC parameters include:


   o  FEC Encoding ID

   o  FEC Instance ID (for FEC Encoding IDs 128-255)

   Where FEC-OTI is given, FEC parameters MUST be described in a "FEC-
   declaration" attribute.  Multiple instances of this attribute MAY
   exist both at session-level and media-level.  If an instance exists
   at session-level, a reference to it MAY be used at media-level, and
   an attribute "FEC" MUST be defined for this purpose.  The absence of
   a both a "FEC-declaration" and a "FEC" attribute at media-level MUST
   be interpreted as the default FEC (Compact No-Code FEC [11] for
   FLUTE).

   The "FEC-declaration" attribute provides general FEC-OTI information
   in FEC Encoding ID and FEC Instance ID values.  This may be extended
   using a "FEC-OTI-extension" attribute, depending on the needs of the
   FEC code used and the lack of an alternative means to signal the
   extended OTI information.  The purpose of extended FEC-OTI
   information define FEC code/instance-specific OTI required for
   receiver FEC payload configuration.  The contents of such an
   extension would be FEC code-specific and exact specification, beyond
   adherence to the ABNF below, needs to be specified by any FEC code
   using this attribute, and hence is outside the scope of this
   document.

   A "FEC-OTI-extension" attribute must be immediately preceded by its
   associated "FEC-declaration" attribute and so the full FEC-OTI,
   including extension, will be found in two neighbouring attribute
   lines.  The fec-ref value binds a "FEC-OTI-extension" and "FEC-
   declaration attribute" pair.

   The syntax for the attributes in ABNF is given below:

      fec-declaration-line = "a=FEC-declaration:" fec-ref SP
                             fec-enc-id [";" SP fec-inst-id] CRLF
      fec-ref = 1*3DIGIT
      ;value is the SDP-internal identifier for FEC-declaration

      fec-enc-id = "encoding-id=" enc-id
      enc-id = 1*DIGIT
      ;value is the FEC Encoding ID used

      fec-inst-id = "instance-id=" inst-id
      inst-id = 1*DIGIT
      ;value is the FEC Instance ID used

      fec-line = "a=FEC:" fec-ref CRLF

      fec-oti-extension-line = "a=FEC-OTI-extension:" fec-ref SP
                               oti-extension CRLF
      oti-extension = base64
      base64 = *base64-unit [base64-pad]
      base64-unit = 4base64-char
      base64-pad = 2base64-char "==" / 3base64-char "="
      base64-char = ALPHA / DIGIT / "+" / "/"

   Examples of FEC-OTI are shown in section 4.

   The FEC parameters are for capabilities description for the session.
   (Note, any "FDT-like" fuller description of files in the session
   could give the FEC parameters per file).  FLUTE's FDT syntax (and
   codepoint header field usage) allows complete specification of these
   FEC parameters in-band with FLUTE (per file).  Thus machine
   configuration can be performed using FLUTE alone.

   There are five main reasons that the FEC Encoding and Instance IDs
   are optional capabilities descriptions:


   1.  It is not always necessary to explicitly describe the FEC
       capabilities in advance of the session - e.g. for simple (and
       short) sessions it can be more elegant to discover this from the
       session (FDT) itself (even when some mechanism for machine-
       readable session parameters, such as IP addresses and ports, is
       wanted in advance).

   2.  There may be some other out-of-band discovery of FEC capability
       requirements (e.g. well known-FEC/standardised capabilities for a
       certain application, verbal agreement between a group, etc.) that
       provides the FEC capability information.  This document does not
       want to prevent this, and in this case repeating the information



Mehta, et al.            Expires January 1, 2006               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft          SDP Descriptors for FLUTE              June 2005


       in SDP would be unnecessary and wasteful (and probably result in
       implementations not following the flute-sdp specification).

   3.  FLUTE defaults to Compact No-Code FEC [11] and support for this
       is mandatory for FLUTE anyway so it is a given (capability
       requirement) which does not need to be described by the SDP.  In
       cases where only Compact No-Code FEC is required, there is no use
       in specifying any FEC Encoding (+Instance) IDs in the SDP (though
       it is allowed).

   4.  In cases where a FLUTE session description (SDP file) is not
       defined once for all time, it is possible that the FEC usage is
       not known in advance and the FEC capabilities would only be added
       to the SDP in a later version of that SDP file when the FEC codes
       have been selected (e.g. a larger audience may suggest stronger
       FEC to make FLUTE delivery more reliable, whereas additional bi-
       directional messages may be scalable for smaller groups).

   5.  Also, in cases where a FLUTE session description (SDP file) is
       very static (e.g. once for all time for that session), it is
       possible that the FEC usage is not known in advance and it needs
       to be left to some other mechanism (e.g.  FDT) to discover any
       FEC capability requirements set closer to the session
       transmission - with the same examples as in (4).

   Also, in a complex case of very many FEC codes being used in the
   session giving a full list in SDP is not seen as being reasonable
   (but this is likely to be a rare case anyway).

   <The description of layered media and identification of any
   congestion control (CC) instance related to them is orthogonal to the
   FEC declarations and other aspect of this document.  Hence, the
   authors assume layering and CC descriptions are not in scope of this
   document.  This assumption is subject to further study.>

3.7  Content Description Pointer

   The syntax of the information that tells receiver, in the first
   place, that the session contains files that are of interest is out of
   scope of this document.  However, the SDP MAY include a content
   description pointer at the session-level to enable efficient linkage
   to such information.

   The content description pointer attribute describes to the
   receiver(s) the URI where the content description is stored.  The
   content description pointer MUST be defined according to the
   "content-desc" attribute.

   The syntax for the attribute in ABNF is given below:

      ;URI-reference is as defined in [10].

   An example of content description pointer is shown in section 4.

3.8  Bandwidth Specification

   The specification of bandwidth (data rate) is optional and where
   included in the SDP it shall adhere to the following rules.  The
   maximum bit-rate required by this FLUTE session shall be specified
   using the "AS" bandwidth modifier [6] on session level.  The maximum
   bit-rate required by a particular FLUTE media-line (one or more FLUTE
   channels, depending on the usage or IP address and port ranges) shall
   be specified using the "AS" bandwidth modifier [1] on media level.
   The Application Specific (AS) bandwidth shall be the largest sum of
   the sizes of all packets transmitted during any one second long
   period of the session or media-line, depending on which level it is
   being used, expressed as kilobits.  The size of the packet shall be
   the complete packet, i.e.  IP, UDP and FLUTE headers, and the data
   payload.

4.  SDP Syntax Examples

   This section gives examples of the use of SDP attributes to describe
   a FLUTE session.

      a=FEC-declaration:1 encoding-id=128; instance-id=0
      a=content-desc:http://www.example.com/flute-sessions/session001
      m=application 12345 FLUTE/UDP *

      m=application 12346 FLUTE/UDP *
      c=IN IP6 FF1E:03AD::7F2E:172A:1E25
      a=FEC:1

           Figure 1: An SDP for FLUTE Session with Two Channels

   Figure 1 shows an example SDP description for FLUTE session with two
   channels.

   The attribute defined in the line "a=source-filter: incl IN IP6 *
   2001:210:1:2:240:96FF:FE25:8EC9" describes a source filter.  In this
   example the source indicates that the receiver(s) should include the
   given IP address (2001:210:1:2:240:96FF:FE25:8EC9) into the session.
   It should be noted that although other possibilities may be used, in
   this case only the incl and * attributes may be used in the above
   attribute.

   The attribute defined in the line "a=flute-tsi:3" describes the
   Transport Session Identifier for the session.  The pair made of the
   source IP address and the TSI together uniquely identifies a FLUTE
   session.

   The source indicates in the above example that it will transmit data
   in the FLUTE session on two channels (a=flute-ch:2).  The source then
   specifies the channels.

   The "a=FEC-declaration" lines describes two different FEC schemes
   used in the FLUTE session.

   The "a=content-desc" line describes the URI where the content
   description is stored.

   The line "m=application 12345 FLUTE/UDP *" indicates the media used
   for the channel.  In this example, there are two "m=" lines for the
   two channels described.

   The destination addresses for the channels are given in the "c="
   lines.  These also show to the receiver(s) that the channels are two
   (maybe more in other cases) consecutive channels.

   The "a=FEC" lines at media-level reference FEC declarations at
   session-level ("a=FEC-declaration").

      c=IN IP6 FF1E:03AD::7F2E:172A:1E24
      a=FEC-declaration:0 encoding-id=128; instance-id=0

   Figure 2 shows an example SDP description for FLUTE session with one
   channel.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1  Transport Protocol

   The "proto" sub-field of the media description field ("m=") describes
   the transport protocol used.  This document registers one value:
   "FLUTE/UDP" is a reference to FLUTE [1] running over UDP/IP.

6.2  Attribute Names

   As recommended by [6], the new attribute names "flute-tsi",
   "flute-ch", "FEC-declaration", "FEC", "FEC-OTI-extension" and
   "content-desc" should be registered with IANA, as follows:

   The following contact information shall be used for all registrations
   included here:
