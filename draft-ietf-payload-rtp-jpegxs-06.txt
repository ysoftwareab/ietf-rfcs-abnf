             RTP Payload Format for ISO/IEC 21122 (JPEG XS)
                    draft-ietf-payload-rtp-jpegxs-06

Abstract

   This document specifies a Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) payload
   format to be used for transporting JPEG XS (ISO/IEC 21122) encoded
   video.  JPEG XS is a low-latency, lightweight image coding system.
   Compared to an uncompressed video use case, it allows higher
   resolutions and frame rates, while offering visually lossless
   quality, reduced power consumption, and end-to-end latency confined
   to a fraction of a frame.

   The JPEG XS coding system offers compression and recompression of
   image sequences with very moderate computational resources while
   remaining robust under multiple compression and decompression cycles
   and mixing of content sources, e.g. embedding of subtitles, overlays
   or logos.  Typical target compression ratios ensuring visually
   lossless quality are in the range of 2:1 to 10:1, depending on the
   nature of the source material.  The end-to-end latency can be
   confined to a fraction of a frame, typically between a small number
   of lines down to below a single line.

3.  Media Format Description

3.1.  Image Data Structures

   JPEG XS is a low-latency lightweight image coding system for coding
   continuous-tone grayscale or continuous-tone colour digital images.

   This coding system provides an efficient representation of image
   signals through the mathematical tool of wavelet analysis.  The
   wavelet filter process separates each component into multiple bands,
   where each band consists of multiple coefficients describing the
   image signal of a given component within a frequency domain specific
   to the wavelet filter type, i.e. the particular filter corresponding
   to the band.

   Wavelet coefficients are grouped into precincts, where each precinct
   includes all coefficients over all bands that contribute to a spatial
   region of the image.

   One or multiple precincts are furthermore combined into slices
   consisting of an integer number of precincts.  Precincts do not cross
   slice boundaries, and wavelet coefficients in precincts that are part
   of different slices can be decoded independently from each other.
   Note, however, that the wavelet transformation runs across slice
   boundaries.  A slice always extends over the full width of the image,
   but may only cover parts of its height.

3.2.  Codestream

   A JPEG XS codestream header, followed by several slices, and
   terminated by an EOC marker form a JPEG XS codestream.

   The overall codestream format, including the definition of all
   markers, is further defined in ISO/IEC 21122-1 [ISO21122-1].  It
   represents sample values of a single image, bare any interpretation
   relative to a colour space.

3.3.  Video support box and colour specification box

   While the information defined in the codestream is sufficient to
   reconstruct the sample values of one image, the interpretation of the
   samples remains undefined by the codestream itself.  This
   interpretation is given by the video support box and the colour
   specification box which contain significant information to correctly
   play the JPEG XS stream.  The layout and syntax of these boxes,
   together with their content, are defined in ISO/IEC 21122-3
   [ISO21122-3].  The video support box provides information on the
   maximum bitrate, the frame rate, the subsampling image format, the

   timecode of the current JPEG XS frame, the profile, level and
   sublevel used (as defined in ISO/IEC 21122-2 [ISO21122-2]), and
   optionally on the buffer model and the mastering display metadata.
   The colour specification box indicates the colour primaries, transfer
   characteristics, matrix coefficients and video full range flag needed
   to specify the colour space of the video stream.

3.4.  JPEG XS Frame

   The concatenation of a video support box, a colour specification box
   and a JPEG XS codestream forms a JPEG XS picture segment.  In the
   case of a video stream made of progressive frames, each frame is made
   of one single JPEG XS picture segment.  In the case of a video stream
   made of interlaced frames, each frame is made of two concatenated
   JPEG XS picture segments.  The codestream of each segment corresponds
   to a field of the interlaced frame.  The boxes in the first segment
   SHALL be equal to the boxes in the second segment.  Note that the
   video information box included in each video support box contains a
   frat field indicating if the frame is progressive or interlaced, and,
   in case of interlaced frame, if the top field (i.e. the field
   containing the top line of the frame) is in the first or second
   segment (see ISO/IEC 21122-3 [ISO21122-3]).

4.  RTP Payload Format

   This section specifies the payload format for JPEG XS streams over
   the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) [RFC3550].

   In order to be transported over RTP, each JPEG XS stream is
   transported in a distinct RTP stream, identified by a distinct SSRC.

   A JPEG XS stream is divided into Application Data Units (ADUs), each
   ADU corresponding to a single JPEG XS frame.

4.1.  RTP packetization

   An ADU is made of several packetization units.  If a packetization
   unit is bigger than the maximum size of a RTP packet payload, the
   unit is split into multiple RTP packet payloads, as illustrated in
   Figure 1.  As seen there, each packet SHALL contain (part of) one and
   only one packetization unit.  A packetization unit may extend over
   multiple packets.  The payload of every packet SHALL have the same
   size (based e.g. on the Maximum Transfer Unit of the network), except
   (possibly) the last packet of a packetization unit.  The boundaries
   of a packetization unit SHALL coincide with the boundaries of the
   payload of a packet (excluding the payload header), i.e. the first
   (resp. last) byte of the packetization unit SHALL be the first (resp.
   last) byte of the payload (excluding its header).

                  Figure 1: Example of ADU packetization

   There are two different packetization modes defined for this RTP
   payload format.

   1.  Codestream packetization mode: in this mode, the packetization
       unit SHALL be the entire codestream, preceeded by boxes.  This
       means that a progressive frame will have a single packetization
       unit, while an interlaced frame will have two.  The progressive
       case is illustrated in Figure 2.

   2.  Slice packetization mode: in this mode, the packetization unit
       SHALL be the slice, i.e. there SHALL be data from no more than
       one slice per RTP packet.  The first packetization unit SHALL be
       made of the JPEG XS header segment (i.e. the concatenation of the
       VS box, the CS box and the JPEG XS codestream header).  This
       first unit is then followed by successive units, each containing
       one and only one slice.  The packetization unit containing the
       last slice of a JPEG XS codestream SHALL also contain the EOC
       marker immediately following this last slice.  This is
       illustrated in Figure 3.  In the case of an interlaced frame, the
       JPEG XS header segment of the second field SHALL be in its own
       packetization unit.

               Figure 3: Example of slice packetization mode

   Due to the constant bit-rate of JPEG XS, the codestream packetization
   mode guarantees that a JPEG XS RTP stream will produce a constant
   number of bytes per frame, and a constant number of RTP packets per
   frame.  To reach the same guarantee with the slice packetization
   mode, an additional mechanism is required.  This can involve a
   constraint at the rate allocation stage in the JPEG XS encoder to
   impose a constant bit-rate at the slice level, the usage of padding
   data, or the insertion of empty RTP packets (i.e. a RTP packet whose
   payload data is empty).

4.2.  RTP Header Usage

   The format of the RTP header is specified in RFC 3550 [RFC3550] and
   reprinted in Figure 4 for convenience.  This RTP payload format uses
   the fields of the header in a manner consistent with that
   specification.

   sequence number, synchronization source (SSRC) and contributing
   source (CSRC) fields follow their respective definitions in RFC 3550
   [RFC3550].

   The remaining RTP header information to be set according to this RTP
   payload format is set as follows:

   Marker (M) [1 bit]:

      If progressive scan video is being transmitted, the marker bit
      denotes the end of a video frame.  If interlaced video is being
      transmitted, it denotes the end of the field.  The marker bit
      SHALL be set to 1 for the last packet of the video frame/field.
      It SHALL be set to 0 for all other packets.

   Payload Type (PT) [7 bits]:

      A dynamically allocated payload type field that designates the
      payload as JPEG XS video.

   Timestamp [32 bits]:

      The RTP timestamp is set to the sampling timestamp of the content.
      A 90 kHz clock rate SHOULD be used.

      As per specified in RFC 3550 [RFC3550] and RFC 4175 [RFC4175], the
      RTP timestamp designates the sampling instant of the first octet
      of the frame to which the RTP packet belongs.  Packets SHALL not
      include data from multiple frames, and all packets belonging to

      the same frame SHALL have the same timestamp.  Several successive
      RTP packets will consequently have equal timestamps if they belong
      to the same frame (that is until the marker bit is set to 1,
      marking the last packet of the frame), and the timestamp is only
      increased when a new frame begins.

      If the sampling instant does not correspond to an integer value of
      the clock, the value SHALL be truncated to the next lowest
      integer, with no ambiguity.

4.3.  Payload Header Usage

   The first four bytes of the payload of an RTP packet in this RTP
   payload format are referred to as the payload header.  Figure 5
   illustrates the structure of this payload header.

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                         Figure 5: Payload header

   The payload header consists of the following fields:

   Transmission mode (T) [1 bit]:

      The T bit is set to indicate that packets are sent sequentially by
      the transmitter.  This information allows a receiver to dimension
      its input buffer(s) accordingly.  If T=0, nothing can be assumed
      about the transmission order and packets may be sent out-of-order
      by the transmitter.  If T=1, packets SHALL be sent sequentially by
      the transmitter.

   pacKetization mode (K) [1 bit]:

      The K bit is set to indicate which packetization mode is used.
      K=0 indicates codestream packetization mode, while K=1 indicates
      slice packetization mode.  In the case that the Transmission mode
      (T) is set to 0, the slice packetization mode SHALL be used and K
      SHALL be set to 1.

   Last (L) [1 bit]:

      The L bit is set to indicate the last packet of a packetization
      unit.  As the end of the frame also ends the packet containing the
      last unit of the frame, the L bit is set whenever the M bit is

Internet-Draft       RTP Payload Format for JPEG XS        November 2020


      set.  If codestream packetization mode is used, L bit and M bit
      are equivalent.

   Interlaced information (I) [2 bit]:

      These 2 bits are used to indicate how the JPEG XS frame is scanned
      (progressive or interlaced).  In case of an interlaced frame, they
      also indicate which JPEG XS picture segment the payload is part of
      (first or second).

       00: The payload is progressively scanned.

       01: Reserved for future use.

       10: The payload is part of the first JPEG XS picture segment of
       an interlaced video frame.  The height specified in the included
       JPEG XS codestream header is half of the height of the entire
       displayed image.

       11: The payload is part of the second JPEG XS picture segment of
       an interlaced video frame.  The height specified in the included
       JPEG XS codestream header is half of the height of the entire
       displayed image.

   F counter [5 bits]:

      The frame (F) counter identifies the frame number modulo 32 to
      which a packet belongs.  Frame numbers are incremented by 1 for
      each frame transmitted.  The frame number, in addition to the
      timestamp, may help the decoder manage its input buffer and bring
      packets back into their natural order.

   SEP counter [11 bits]:

      The Slice and Extended Packet (SEP) counter is used differently
      depending on the packetization mode.

      *  In the case of codestream packetization mode (K=0), this
         counter resets whenever the Packet counter resets (see
         hereunder), and increments by 1 whenever the Packet counter
         overruns.

      *  In the case of slice packetization mode (K=1), this counter
         identifies the slice modulo 2047 to which the packet
         contributes.  If the data belongs to the JPEG XS header
         segment, this field SHALL have its maximal value, namely 2047 =
         0x07ff.  Otherwise, it is the slice index modulo 2047.  Slice

Internet-Draft       RTP Payload Format for JPEG XS        November 2020


         indices are counted from 0 (corresponding to the top of the
         frame).

   P counter [11 bits]:

      The packet (P) counter identifies the packet number modulo 2048
      within the current packetization unit.  It is set to 0 at the
      start of the packetization unit and incremented by 1 for every
      subsequent packet (if any) belonging to the same unit.
      Practically, if codestream packetization mode is enabled, this
      field counts the packets within a JPEG XS picture segment and is
      extended by the SEP counter when it overruns.  If slice
      packetization mode is enabled, this field counts the packets
      within a slice or within the JPEG XS header segment.

4.4.  Payload Data

   The payload data of a JPEG XS RTP stream consists of a concatenation
   of multiple JPEG XS frames.

   Each JPEG XS frame is the concatenation of one or more packetization
   unit(s), as explained in Section 4.1.  Figure 6 depicts this layout
   for a progressive frame in the codestream packetization mode,
   Figure 7 depicts this layout for an interlaced frame in the
   codestream packetization mode, Figure 8 depicts this layout for a
   progressive frame in the slice packetization mode and Figure 9
   depicts this layout for an interlaced frame in the slice
   packetization mode.  The Frame counter value is not indicated because
   the value is constant for all packetization units of a given frame.

4.5.  Traffic Shaping and Delivery Timing

   The traffic shaping and delivery timing SHALL be in accordance with
   the Network Compatibility Model compliance definitions specified in
   SMPTE ST 2110-21 [SMPTE-ST2110-21] for either Narrow Linear Senders
   (Type NL) or Wide Senders (Type W).  The session description SHALL
   include a format-specific parameter of either TP=2110TPNL or

   TP=2110TPW to indicate compliance with Type NL or Type W
   respectively.

   NOTE: The Virtual Receiver Buffer Model compliance definitions of ST
   2110-21 do not apply.

5.  Congestion Control Considerations

   Congestion control for RTP SHALL be used in accordance with RFC 3550
   [RFC3550], and with any applicable RTP profile: e.g., RFC 3551
   [RFC3551].  An additional requirement if best-effort service is being
   used is users of this payload format SHALL monitor packet loss to
   ensure that the packet loss rate is within acceptable parameters.
   Circuit Breakers [RFC8083] is an update to RTP [RFC3550] that defines
   criteria for when one is required to stop sending RTP Packet Streams
   and applications implementing this standard SHALL comply with it.
   RFC 8085 [RFC8085] provides additional information on the best
   practices for applying congestion control to UDP streams.

6.  Payload Format Parameters

6.1.  Media Type Definition

   Type name:  video

   Subtype name:  jxsv

   Required parameters:

     rate: The RTP timestamp clock rate.  Applications using this
     payload format SHOULD use a value of 90000.

     transmode: Indicates if packets are sent sequentially by the
     transmitter.  A receiver could use this information to dimension
     its input buffer(s) accordingly.  If set to 0, nothing can be
     assumed about the transmission order and packets may be sent out-
     of-order.  If value is 1, packets SHALL be sent sequentially by the
     transmitter.

   Optional parameters:

     profile: The JPEG XS profile in use, as defined in ISO/IEC 21122-2
     (JPEG XS Part 2) [ISO21122-2].  Any white space in the profile name
     SHALL be replaced by a dash (-).  Examples are 'Main-444.12' or
     'High-444.12'.

     character (e.g. "30000/1001"), utilizing the numerically smallest
     numerator value possible.

     interlace: If this parameter name is present, it indicates that the
     video is interlaced, or that the video is Progressive segmented
     Frame (PsF).  If this parameter name is not present, the
     progressive video format SHALL be assumed.

     segmented: If this parameter name is present, and the interlace
     parameter name is also present, then the video is a Progressive
     segmented Frame (PsF).  Signaling of this parameter without the
     interlace parameter is forbidden.

     sampling: Signals the colour difference signal sub-sampling
     structure.

       Signals utilizing the non-constant luminance Y'C'B C'R signal
       format of Recommendation ITU-R BT.601-7, Recommendation ITU-R

                    manually coordinated between sender and receiver.

     Signals utilizing the Recommendation ITU-R BT.2100 colorimetry
     SHOULD also signal the representational range using the optional

     RANGE: This parameter SHOULD be used to signal the encoding range
     of the sample values within the stream.  When paired with ITU Rec
     BT.2100 colorimetry, this parameter has two allowed values NARROW
     and FULL, corresponding to the ranges specified in table 9 of ITU
     Rec BT.2100.  In any other context, this parameter has three
     allowed values: NARROW, FULLPROTECT, and FULL, which correspond to
     the ranges specified in SMPTE RP 2077.  In the absence of this
     parameter, and for all but the UNSPECIFIED colometries, NARROW
     SHALL be the assumed value.  When paired with the UNSPECIFIED
     colometry, FULL SHALL be the default assumed value.

   Encoding considerations:

    This media type is framed and binary; see Section 4.8 in RFC 6838
    [RFC6838].

   Security considerations:

    Please see the Security Considerations section in RFC XXXX

6.2.  Mapping to SDP

6.2.1.  General

   A Session Description Protocol (SDP) object SHALL be created for each
   RTP stream and it SHALL be in accordance with the provisions of SMPTE
   ST 2110-10 [SMPTE-ST2110-10].

   The information carried in the media type specification has a
   specific mapping to fields in the Session Description Protocol (SDP),
   which is commonly used to describe RTP sessions.  This information is
   redundant with the information found in the payload data (namely, in
   the JPEG XS header segment) and SHALL be consistent with it.  In case
   of discrepancy between parameters values found in the payload data
   and in the SDP fields, the values from the payload data SHALL
   prevail.

6.2.2.  Media type and subtype

   The media type ("video") goes in SDP "m=" as the media name.

   The media subtype ("jxsv") goes in SDP "a=rtpmap" as the encoding
   name, followed by a slash ("/") and the required parameter "rate"
   corresponding to the RTP timestamp clock rate (which for the payload
   format defined in this document SHOULD be 90000).  The required
   parameter "transmode" and the additional optional parameters go in
   the SDP "a=fmtp" attribute by copying them directly from the MIME




Lugan, et al.              Expires May 6, 2021                 [Page 22]

Internet-Draft       RTP Payload Format for JPEG XS        November 2020


   media type string as a semicolon-separated list of parameter=value
   pairs.

   A sample SDP mapping for JPEG XS video is as follows:

        m=video 30000 RTP/AVP 112
        a=rtpmap:112 jxsv/90000
        a=fmtp:112 transmode=1;sampling=YCbCr-4:2:2;width=1920;
                   height=1080;depth=10;colorimetry=BT709;TCS=SDR;
                   RANGE=FULL;TP=2110TPNL

   In this example, a JPEG XS RTP stream is being sent to UDP
   destination port 30000, with an RTP dynamic payload type of 112 and a
   media clock rate of 90000 Hz.  Note that the "a=fmtp:" line has been
   wrapped to fit this page, and will be a single long line in the SDP
   file.

6.2.3.  Traffic shaping

   The SDP object SHALL include the TP parameter (either 2110TPNL or
   2110TPW as specified in Section 4.5) and may include the CMAX
   parameter as specified in SMPTE ST 2110-21 [SMPTE-ST2110-21].

6.2.4.  Offer/Answer Considerations

   All parameters are declarative.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This memo requests that IANA registers video/jxsv as specified in
   Section 6.1.  The media type is also requested to be added to the
   IANA registry for "RTP Payload Format MIME types" [1].

8.  Security Considerations

   RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification
   are subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP
   specification [RFC3550] and in any applicable RTP profile such as
   RTP/AVP [RFC3551], RTP/AVPF [RFC4585], RTP/SAVP [RFC3711], or RTP/
   SAVPF [RFC5124].  This implies that confidentiality of the media
   streams is achieved by encryption.

   However, as "Securing the RTP Framework: Why RTP Does Not Mandate a
   Single Media Security Solution" [RFC7202] discusses, it is not an RTP
   payload format's responsibility to discuss or mandate what solutions
   are used to meet the basic security goals like confidentiality,
   integrity, and source authenticity for RTP in general.  This
   responsibility lies on anyone using RTP in an application.  They can

Internet-Draft       RTP Payload Format for JPEG XS        November 2020


   find guidance on available security mechanisms and important
   considerations in "Options for Securing RTP Sessions" [RFC7201].
   Applications SHOULD use one or more appropriate strong security
   mechanisms.

   This payload format and the JPEG XS encoding do not exhibit any
   substantial non-uniformity, either in output or in complexity to
   perform the decoding operation and thus are unlikely to pose a
   denial-of-service threat due to the receipt of pathological
   datagrams.

   It is important to note that HD or UHDTV JPEG XS-encoded video can
   have significant bandwidth requirements (typically more than 1 Gbps
   for ultra high-definition video, especially if using high framerate).
   This is sufficient to cause potential for denial-of-service if
   transmitted onto most currently available Internet paths.

   Accordingly, if best-effort service is being used, users of this
   payload format SHALL monitor packet loss to ensure that the packet
   loss rate is within acceptable parameters.  Packet loss is considered
   acceptable if a TCP flow across the same network path, and
   experiencing the same network conditions, would achieve an average
   throughput, measured on a reasonable timescale, that is not less than
   the RTP flow is achieving.  This condition can be satisfied by
   implementing congestion control mechanisms to adapt the transmission
   rate (or the number of layers subscribed for a layered multicast
   session), or by arranging for a receiver to leave the session if the
   loss rate is unacceptably high.

   This payload format may also be used in networks that provide
   quality-of-service guarantees.  If enhanced service is being used,
   receivers SHOULD monitor packet loss to ensure that the service that
   was requested is actually being delivered.  If it is not, then they
   SHOULD assume that they are receiving best-effort service and behave
   accordingly.
