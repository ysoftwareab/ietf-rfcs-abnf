        Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) Object Tagging
                  draft-ietf-regext-rdap-object-tag-02

Abstract

   The Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) includes a method that
   can be used to identify the authoritative server for processing
   domain name, IP address, and autonomous system number queries.  The
   method does not describe how to identify the authoritative server for
   processing other RDAP query types, such as entity queries.  This
   limitation exists because the identifiers associated with these query
   types are typically unstructured.  This document updates RFC 7484 by
   describing an operational practice that can be used to add structure
   to RDAP identifiers that makes it possible to identify the
   authoritative server for additional RDAP queries.

1.  Introduction

   The Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) includes a method
   ([RFC7484]) that can be used to identify the authoritative server for
   processing domain name, IP address, and autonomous system number
   (ASN) queries.  This method works because each of these data elements
   is structured in a way that facilitates automated parsing of the
   element and association of the data element with a particular RDAP
   service provider.  For example, domain names include labels (such as
   "com", "net", and "org") that are associated with specific service
   providers.

   As noted in Section 9 of RFC 7484 [RFC7484], the method does not
   describe how to identify the authoritative server for processing
   entity queries, name server queries, help queries, or queries using
   certain search patterns.  This limitation exists because the
   identifiers bound to these queries are typically not structured in a
   way that makes it easy to associate an identifier with a specific
   service provider.  This document describes an operational practice
   that can be used to add structure to RDAP identifiers that makes it

   possible to identify the authoritative server for additional RDAP
   queries.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Object Naming Practice

   Tagging object identifiers with a service provider tag makes it
   possible to identify the authoritative server for processing an RDAP
   query using the method described in RFC 7484 [RFC7484].  A service
   provider tag is constructed by prepending the Unicode HYPHEN-MINUS
   character "-" (U+002D, described as an "unreserved" character in RFC
   3986 [RFC3986]) to an IANA-registered value that represents the
   service provider.  For example, a tag for a service provider
   identified by the string value "ARIN" is represented as "-ARIN".

   Service provider tags are concatenated to the end of RDAP query
   object identifiers to unambiguously identify the authoritative server
   for processing an RDAP query.  Building on the example from
   Section 3.1.5 of RFC 7482 [RFC7482], an RDAP entity handle can be
   constructed that allows an RDAP client to bootstrap an entity query.
   The following identifier is used to find information for the entity
   associated with handle "XXXX" at service provider "ARIN":

   XXXX-ARIN

   Clients that wish to bootstrap an entity query can parse this
   identifier into distinct handle and service provider identifier
   elements.  Handles can themselves contain HYPHEN-MINUS characters;
   the service provider identifier is found following the last HYPHEN-
   MINUS character in the tagged identifier.  The service provider
   identifier is used to retrieve a base RDAP URL from an IANA registry.
   The base URL and entity handle are then used to form a complete RDAP
   query path segment.  For example, if the base RDAP URL
   "https://example.com/rdap/" is associated with service provider
   "YYYY" in an IANA registry, an RDAP client will parse a tagged entity
   identifier "XXXX-YYYY" into distinct handle ("XXXX") and service
   provider ("YYYY") identifiers.  The service provider identifier
   "YYYY" is used to query an IANA registry to retrieve the base RDAP
   URL "https://example.com/rdap/".  The base RDAP URL is concatenated
   to the entity handle to create a complete RDAP query path segment of
   "https://example.com/rdap/entity/XXXX-YYYY".

   Implementation of this practice requires tagging of unstructured
   potential query identifiers in RDAP responses.  Consider these elided
   examples from Section 5.3 of RFC 7483 [RFC7483] in which the handle
   identifiers have been tagged with a service provider tag:

                                 Figure 2

   As described in Section 5 of RFC 7483 [RFC7483], RDAP responses can
   contain "self" links.  Service provider tags and self references
   SHOULD be consistent.  If they are inconsistent, the service provider
   tag is processed with higher priority when using these values to
   identify a service provider.

   There is a risk of unpredictable processing behavior if the HYPHEN-
   MINUS character is used for naturally occurring, non-separator
   purposes in an entity handle.  This could lead to a client mistakenly
   assuming that a HYPHEN-MINUS character represents a separator and the
   text that follows HYPHEN-MINUS is a service provider identifier.  A
   client that queries the IANA registry for what they assume is a valid
   service provider will likely receive an unexpected, invalid result.
   As a consequence, use of the HYPHEN-MINUS character as a service

   provider tag separator MUST be noted by adding rdapConformance value
   to query responses as described in Section 4.

   The HYPHEN-MINUS character was chosen as a separator for two reasons:
   1) it is a familiar separator character in operational use, and 2) it
   avoids collision with URI-reserved characters.  The list of
   unreserved characters specified in Section 2.3 of RFC 3986 [RFC3986]
   provided multiple options for consideration:

   unreserved = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / "_" / "~"

   ALPHA and DIGIT characters were excluded because they are commonly
   used in entity handles for non-separator purposes.  HYPHEN-MINUS is
   commonly used as a separator and recognition of this practice will
   reduce implementation requirements and operational risk.  The
   remaining characters were excluded because they are not broadly used
   as separators in entity handles.

3.  Bootstrap Service Registry for RDAP Service Providers

   The bootstrap service registry for the RDAP service provider space is
   represented using the structure specified in Section 3 of RFC 7484
   [RFC7484].  The JSON output of this registry contains alphanumeric
   identifiers that identify RDAP service providers, grouped by base
   RDAP URLs, as shown in this example.

   Alphanumeric service provider identifiers conform to the suffix
   portion ("\w{1,8}") of the "roidType" syntax specified in Section 4.2
   of RFC 5730 [RFC5730].

3.1.  Registration Procedure

   The service provider registry is populated using the "First Come
   First Served" policy defined in RFC 8126 [RFC8126].  Provider
   identifier values can be derived and assigned by IANA on request.
   Registration requests include the requested service provider
   identifier (or an indication that IANA should assign an identifier)
   and one or more base RDAP URLs to be associated with the service
   provider identifier.

4.  RDAP Conformance

   RDAP responses that contain values described in this document MUST
   indicate conformance with this specification by including an
   rdapConformance ([RFC7483]) value of "rdap_objectTag_level_0".  The

   information needed to register this value in the RDAP Extensions
   Registry is described in Section 5.2.

   Example rdapConformance structure with extension specified:

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to create the RDAP Bootstrap Services Registry
   listed below and make it available as JSON objects.  The contents of
   this registry is described in Section 3, with the formal syntax
   specified in Section 10 of RFC 7484 [RFC7484].

5.1.  Bootstrap Service Registry for RDAP Service Providers

   Entries in this registry contain at least the following:

   o  An alphanumeric value that identifies the RDAP service provider
      being registered.
   o  One or more URLs that provide the RDAP service regarding this
      registration.

5.2.  RDAP Extensions Registry

   IANA is requested to register the following value in the RDAP
   Extensions Registry:

      Extension identifier: rdap_objectTag
      Registry operator: Any
      Published specification: This document.
      Contact: IESG <iesg@ietf.org>
      Intended usage: This extension describes a best practice for
      structuring entity identifiers to enable query bootstrapping.

7.  Security Considerations

   This practice helps to ensure that end users will get RDAP data from
   an authoritative source using a bootstrap method to find
   authoritative RDAP servers, reducing the risk of sending queries to
   non-authoritative sources.  The method has the same security
   properties as the RDAP protocols themselves.  The transport used to
   access the IANA registries can be more secure by using TLS [RFC5246],
   which IANA supports.  Additional considerations associated with RDAP
   are described in RFC 7481 [RFC7481].

Appendix A.  Change Log

   00:  Initial version.
   01:  Changed separator character from HYPHEN MINUS to COMMERCIAL AT.
      Added a recommendation to maintain consistency between service
      provider tags and "self" links (suggestion received from Tom
      Harrison).  Fixed a spelling error, and corrected the network
      example in Section 2 (editorial erratum reported for RFC 7483 by
      Marcos Sanz).  Added acknowledgements.
   02:  Changed separator character from COMMERCIAL AT to TILDE.
      Clarity updates and fixed an example handle.  Added text to
      describe the risk of separator characters appearing naturally in
      entity handles and being misinterpreted as separator characters.
   03:  Added Implementation Status section (Section 6).
   04:  Keepalive refresh.
   05:  Added OpenRDAP implementation information to Section 6.

   00:  Initial working group version.
   01:  Added text to describe why the TILDE character was chosen as the
      separator character.
   02:  Nit fixes.  Added rdapConformance text, switched back to HYPHEN
      MINUS, and added IANA registration instructions per working group
      last call discussion.  Updated suffix syntax reference from the
      IANA EPP ROID registry to RFC 5730 (which is what the IANA
      registry references).
