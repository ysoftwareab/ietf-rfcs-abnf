                Reassignment of System Ports to the IESG
                    draft-kuehlewind-system-ports-01

Abstract

   In the IANA Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry
   a large number of System Ports is currently assigned to individuals
   or companies who have registered the port for the use with a certain
   protocol before RFC6335 was published.  For some of these ports RFCs
   exist that describe the respective protocol, for other RFCs are under
   development that define, re-define, or assign the protocol used for
   the respective port, e.g. in case of so-far unused UDP ports that
   have been registered together with the respective TCP port.  In these
   cases the IESG has the change control about the protocol used on the
   port (as described in an RFC) but does not have the change control
   about the port usage itself.  Currently, to transfer the change
   control to the IESG, the original assignee has to be contacted to
   initialize this transfer.  As it is not always possible to still get
   in touch with the original assignee, e.g. because of out-dated
   contact information or more severe reasons, and the current practice
   of case-by-case changes does not scale well, this document instructs
   IANA to perform actions with the goal to reassigns all System Ports
   to the IESG that have been assigned to individuals prior to the
   publication of RFC6335.

1.  Introduction

   RFC 6335 [RFC6335] requires System Ports, also known as the Well
   Known Ports, in the range from 0 to 1023, to be assigned by the "IETF
   Review" or "IESG Approval" procedures [RFC5226].  Further, for
   assignments done through RFCs published via the "IETF Document
   Stream" [RFC4844], the Assignee will be the IESG with the IETF Chair
   as the Contact.  Therefore, all System Ports must be assigned to the
   IESG.

   However, ports that were assigned before the publication of RFC 6335,
   are often assigned to individuals, even if they are part of the
   System Port range.  Besides the fact that System Ports that are
   widely used by IETF protocols under IETF change control, this is
   especially problematic if the assignment is or should be changed.
   The Assignee, can change the assignment without confirmation of the
   IETF.  However, if the IETF process requires a change, including de-
   assignment, this cannot be done without the agreement of the original
   Assignee.  Furthermore, no procedure is defined to change the
   assignment in cases where the original Assignee is not reachable or
   for any other reason not available anymore,

   This document instructs IANA to perform actions with the goal to re-
   assign all currently assigned System Ports in the range from 0 to
   1023 to the IESG, with will also help to aligning existing entries in
   the "Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry" with
   the current procedures defined in RFC 6335.

2.  IANA Considerations

   IANA [will re-assign/has reassigned] all System Ports in the port
   range from 0 to 1023 that are currently assigned in the "Service Name
   and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry"

Internet-Draft        Reassignment of System Ports         February 2018


   (https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-
   names-port-numbers.xhtml) to the IESG <iesg@ietf.org> as Assignee and
   the IETF Chair <chair@ietf.org> as Contact.  The original Assignee
   and respective contact information should be preserved as a
   Assignment note "Originally assigned to $Assignee <$Contact>" where
   $Assignee is the current value in the Assignee column and $Contact is
   the current value in the Contact column.

   To perform the assignment IANA is requested to contact the current
   Assignees by email with the registered email address to request the
   transfer.  If the provided email address is not valid anymore, IANA
   is requested to report to the IESG and the IESG is requested to
   perform actions, such as sending requests to the ietf@ietf.org
   mailing list, to determine updated contact information.  If these
   action do not show success within 4 weeks, the IESG is requested to
   make a decision about the re-assignment of the port in question.

   IANA is requested to send the following request to each current
   Assignees:

   "Dear $Assignee, you are the assignee for port $Port in the Service
   Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry.  This port is part
   of the System Ports range which has a registration policy of "IETF
   Review" or "IESG Approval" as defined in RFC6335 given the System
   Ports range is already densely assigned.  To enable the future
   documentation in the RFC series of the protocol in use for this port,
   we would like to request you to confirm that you agree to de-assign
   the port to enable a subsequent re-assignment to the IESG.  We will
   still note you as the original assignee with this contact information
   in the registry, expect you prefer to not be noted anymore.  Please
   let us know if there is any reason to not perform this change, or if
   the port is known to not be used (anymore) and can be reclassified as
   reserved instead.  Also if you have information about an publicly
   available specification of the protocol in use on the respective port
   that is not noted in the registry yet, we would be graceful to learn
   about this and update the notes in the registry accordingly."

   If the current Assignee does not agree to the re-assignment or does
   not reply within four weeks, IANA is requested to inform the IESG
   which then is requested to make a decision about the re-assignment of
   the port in question.

   Before the start of this re-assignment process, IANA [will also
   update/has further updated] the Reference column with the following
   reference for the listed ports that have a corresponding published
   RFC that uses this port number, as well as the Assignment Notes
   column for historic RFCs:
