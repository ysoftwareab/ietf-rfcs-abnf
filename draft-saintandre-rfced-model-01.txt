                      RFC Editor Model (Version 3)
                    draft-saintandre-rfced-model-01

Abstract

   This document describes Version 3 of the RFC Editor model.  As
   specified here, the model divides the responsibilities for the RFC
   Series into two high-level functions: policy definition governing the
   Series as a whole, and policy implementation through publication of
   documents in the Series.  The policy definition function is the
   responsibility of the RFC Series Working Group (RSWG), which produces
   policy proposals that are subject to approval by the RFC Series
   Approval Board (RSAB).  The policy implementation function is
   primarily the responsibility of the RFC Production Center (RPC),
   under the ultimate authority of the IETF Administration Limited
   Liability Company (LLC).

   This document reflects experience gained with version 1 of the RFC
   Editor Model as specified in RFC 5620 and with version 2 as specified
   in RFC 6635 and RFC 8728.

   This document obsoletes RFC 8728.

1.  Introduction

   NOTE: This document is a work in progress.  Although it is intended
   to describe consensus forged in the RFCED-Future Program, many
   aspects are not yet settled; as a result, this document contains
   proposals and conjectures that do not yet have consensus in the
   Program.  Where possible, open issues are identified herein to foster
   discussion.

   Documents in the Request for Comments (RFC) series have been
   continually published since 1969 [RFC8700].  The RFC series is
   described in [RFC8729].  RFC 8729 uses the term "RFC Editor function"
   or "RFC Editor" to identify the collective set of responsibilities
   for publishing documents in the RFC series.

   The processes and organizational models for publication of RFCs have
   changed significantly over the years.  Most recently, in 2009
   [RFC5620] defined the RFC Editor Model (Version 1) and in 2012
   [RFC6635] defined the RFC Editor Model (Version 2), since modified
   slightly in 2020 by [RFC8728].

   In order to provide a sustainable basis for continued publication of
   the RFC series, this document describes Version 3 of the RFC Editor
   model, which divides the responsibilities for the RFC Series into two
   high-level functions: policy definition governing the Series as a
   whole, and policy implementation through publication of documents in
   the Series.  The policy definition function is the responsibility of
   the RFC Series Working Group (RSWG), which produces policy proposals
   that are subject to approval by the RFC Series Approval Board (RSAB).
   The policy implementation function is primarily the responsibility of
   the RFC Production Center (RPC), under the ultimate authority of the
   IETF Administration Limited Liability Company (LLC) [RFC8711].

   This document obsoletes RFC 8728 by making a full update to the RFC
   Editor Model, changing the responsibilities of existing bodies and
   functions, and introducing new functions (see Section 7 of this
   document for a summary of the changes from Version 2).

2.  Overview of the Model

   Version 2 of the RFC Editor Model [RFC8728] specified a structure
   consisting of the RFC Series Editor, the RFC Production Center, and
   the RFC Publisher, with oversight provided by the RFC Series
   Oversight Committee (RSOC) on behalf of the Internet Architecture
   Board (IAB).

Internet-Draft             RFC Editor Model v3                 June 2021


   Discussion within the RFCED-Future Program has led in the direction
   of a more consensus-oriented structure (similar in some respects to
   the structure of technical work within the IETF or IRTF) that retains
   roles for specialized expertise in document editing and publication.

   The policy definition function is performed by the RFC Series Working
   Group (RSWG), which produces policy proposals that are subject to
   approval by the RFC Series Approval Board (RSAB).  The RSWG is an
   open working group (as described below) that seeks input and
   participation from a wide range of persons who are have an interest
   in the RFC Series.  The RSAB consists of appointed members who
   represent the various RFC streams [RFC8728] as well as an expert in
   technical publishing.

   The policy implementation function is performed by the RFC Production
   Center (RPC), under the ultimate authority of the IETF Administration
   Limited Liability Company (LLC).

3.  Policy Definition Function

   Policies governing the RFC series as a whole shall be defined in the
   open through proposals that are generated by and discussed within the
   RFC Series Working Group (RSWG) and then approved by the RFC Series
   Approval Board (RSAB).

   Policies under the purview of the RSWG and RSAB might include but are
   not necessarily limited to document formats, processes for
   publication and dissemination of RFCs, and overall management of the
   RFC series.

3.1.  Structure and Roles

3.1.1.  RFC Series Working Group (RSWG)

   The RFC Series Working Group (RSWG) shall formulate proposals
   regarding policies that govern the RFC series.  The intent is that
   the RSWG operate in a way similar to working groups in the IETF and
   research groups in the IRTF.  Therefore, all RSWG meetings shall be
   open to any participant, subject to intellectual property policies
   which must be consistent with those of the IETF as specified in BCP
   78 [RFC5378] and BCP 79 [RFC8179].  When the RSWG is formed, all
   discussions shall take place on an open email discussion list.
   Subsequently, the RSWG may decide by rough consensus to use
   additional tooling or forms of communication (e.g., GitHub as
   specified in [RFC8874]) as long as they are consistent with
   [RFC2418].

Internet-Draft             RFC Editor Model v3                 June 2021


   All interested persons are welcome to participate in the RSWG
   (subject to anti-harassment policies as described below).  This
   includes participants in the IETF and IRTF, IAB and IESG members, RFC
   authors, individuals who use RFCs in procurement decisions, and the
   like.  The IETF LLC Board members, staff, and the Executive Director
   are invited to participate as community members in the RSWG to the
   extent permitted by any relevant IETF LLC policies.  Members of the
   RSAB are also expected to participate actively.

   The RSWG shall have two chairs, one appointed by the IESG and the
   other appointed by the IAB.  Chairs shall serve for a term of two (2)
   years, with no term limits on renewal.  The appointing bodies shall
   determine their own processes for making these appointments, such as
   provision for an open nominations period.  Community members who have
   concerns about the performance of an RSWG chair should direct their
   feedback to the relevant appointing body.

   NOTE: This section is intended to address ISSUE #14 [1], ISSUE #41
   [2], and ISSUE #44 [3].

3.1.2.  RFC Series Approval Board (RSAB)

   The RFC Series Approval Board (RSAB) shall act as the approving body
   for proposals generated within the RSWG.  The sole function of RSAB
   is to review policy proposals generated by the RSWG; it shall have no
   independent authority to formulate policy on its own.

   The voting members of the RSAB shall be as follows:

   o  One delegate representing the IETF stream, appointed by the IESG

   o  One delegate representing the IAB stream, appointed by the IAB

   o  The IRTF Chair, representing the IRTF stream

   o  The Independent Submissions Editor [RFC8730]

   o  The RFC Series Editor/Advisor

   Whenever a new stream is created [RFC4844], a voting member
   representing that stream shall also be added to the RSAB, either an
   appointed delegate or a direct representative in accordance with the
   document that creates the stream.

   The RSAB shall choose a chair from among its members using a method
   to be determined by the RSAB.  The RSAB is expected to operate via
   email, teleconferencing systems, and any necessary tooling.

Internet-Draft             RFC Editor Model v3                 June 2021


   The RSAB shall keep a public record of its proceedings, including
   minutes of all meetings and a record of all decisions.

   The RSAB shall announce plans and agendas for their meetings on the
   RFC Editor website and by email to the RSWG at least a week before
   such meetings.  The meetings shall be open for public attendance and
   the RSAB may consider allowing open participation.  If the RSAB needs
   to discuss a confidential matter in Executive Session, that part of
   the meeting shall be private to the RSAB, but must be noted on the
   agenda, and must be documented in the minutes with as much detail as
   the confidentiality requirements permit.

   NOTE: This section is intended to address ISSUE #9 [4], ISSUE #38
   [5], ISSUE #50 [6], and ISSUE #53 [7].

3.2.  Process

3.2.1.  Intent

   The intent is to provide an open forum by which policies related to
   the RFC series are defined and evolved.  The general expectation is
   that all interested parties will participate in the RSWG, and that
   only under extreme circumstances should RSAB members need to hold
   "CONCERN" positions as described below.

   Because policy issues can be difficult and contentious, RSWG
   participants and RSAB members are strongly encouraged to work
   together in a spirit of good faith and mutual understanding to
   achieve rough consensus (see [RFC7282]).  In particular, RSWG members
   are encouraged to take RSAB concerns seriously, and RSAB members are
   encouraged to clearly express their concerns early in the process and
   to be responsive to the community.  All parties are encouraged to
   respect the value of each stream and the long term health and
   viability of the RFC series.

   This process is intended to be one of continuous consultation.  RSAB
   members should consult with their constituent stakeholders (e.g.,
   authors, editors, tool developers, and consumers of RFCs) on an
   ongoing basis, so that when the time comes to consider a proposal,
   there should be no surprises.  Appointing bodies are expected to
   establish whatever processes they deem appropriate to facilitate this
   goal.

3.2.2.  Specifics

   The following process shall be used to formulate or modify processes
   related to the RFC series:

Internet-Draft             RFC Editor Model v3                 June 2021


   1.  An individual participant in the RSWG generates a proposal in the
       form of an Internet-Draft.

   2.  If there is sufficient interest in the proposal, RSWG may adopt
       the proposal as a draft proposal of the RSWG, much the same way a
       working group of the IETF or IRTF would.

   3.  The RSWG shall then further develop the proposal.  Members of the
       RSAB are expected to participate in discussion relating to such
       proposals so that they are fully aware of proposals early in the
       policy definition process and so that any issues or concerns that
       they have will be raised during the development of the proposals
       and will not be left until the RSAB review period.

   4.  At some point, if the RSWG chairs believe there may be rough
       consensus for the proposal to advance, they will issue a working
       group last call.

   5.  After a suitable period of time, the RSWG chairs will determine
       whether rough consensus for the proposal exists.  If comments
       have been received and substantial changes have been made, it is
       expected that additional last calls may be necessary.

   6.  Once consensus is established in the RSWG, the RSAB shall issue a
       community call for comments as further described below.  Should
       substantial comments be received, the RSWG will again consider
       those comments and make revisions as they see fit.  At this same
       time, the RSAB will consider the proposal.

   7.  Should substantial changes be made, additional community calls
       for comment should be issued by the RSAB, and again comments
       considered by the RSWG.

   8.  Once all comments have been been addressed, the RSWG chairs will
       submit the proposal to the RSAB for its consideration.

   9.  Within a reasonable period of time, the RSAB will then poll on
       the proposal.  Positions may be as follows: * "YES": the proposal
       should be approved * "CONCERN": the proposal raises substantial
       concerns that must be addressed.  * "RECUSE": the person holding
       the position has a conflict of interest.

   Anyone holding a "CONCERN" position must explain their concern to the
   community in detail.  The explanation may or may not be actionable.

   A CONCERN may be made for two reasons:





Saint-Andre             Expires December 18, 2021               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft             RFC Editor Model v3                 June 2021


   o  The proposal represents a serious problem for the group a
      particular member represents.

   o  The member believes that the proposal would cause serious harm to
      the overall series, including harm to the long term health and
      viability of the series.

   No CONCERN should ever come as a surprise to the RSWG.

   1.  If a CONCERN exists, discussion will take place within the RSWG.
       Again, all RSAB members are expected to participate.

   2.  A proposal without any CONCERN positions is approved.  If
       substantial changes have been made in order to address CONCERN
       positions, an additional call for community input might be
       necessary.

   3.  If, after a suitable period of time, any CONCERN positions
       remain, a formal vote of the RSAB is taken.  If a majority of
       RSAB members vote to approve, the proposal is approved.
       Otherwise, it is returned to the RSWG.  In the case of a tie, the
       proposal is approved.

   4.  When a proposal is approved, a notification is sent to the
       community, and the document enters the queue for publication as
       an RFC.

   ISSUE #22 [8]: In which stream [RFC8729] are these documents
   published?  Is a new stream (e.g., the "Editorial Stream") needed?

3.2.3.  Community Calls for Comment

   When a community call for comment is made, the RSAB sends a notice
   containing:

   o  A subject line beginning with 'Call for Comment:'

   o  A clear, concise summary of the proposal

   o  A URL for the proposal document

   o  Any commentary or questions for the community that the RSAB deems
      necessary (using their usual decision-making procedures)

   o  Clear instructions on how to provide public comments

   o  A deadline for comments

Internet-Draft             RFC Editor Model v3                 June 2021


   Notices will always be sent to the rfc-interest mailing list.  The
   RSAB and RSWG should also send notices to other communities that may
   be interested in or impacted by a proposal as they see fit, following
   policies for those fora as appropriate.  Notices are also to be made
   available and archived on the rfc-editor.org web site, and other
   communication channels can be established for notices (e.g., using an
   RSS feed, social media).

   A comment period will not last less than two weeks.  Comments will be
   publicly archived on the rfc-editor.org web site.

   NOTE: This section is intended to address ISSUE #67 [9]

3.2.4.  Appeals

   Appeals of RSWG decisions shall be made to the RSAB and should be
   made within thirty (30) days of public notice of the relevant RSWG
   decision.  The RSAB shall decide whether a process failure occurred
   and what if any corrective action should take place.

   Appeals of RSAB decisions shall be made to an entity yet to be
   determined and should be made within thirty (30) days of public
   notice of the relevant RSAB decision (typically, when minutes are
   posted).  The appeals body shall decide whether a process failure
   occurred and what if any corrective action should take place.

   ISSUE #16 [10]: Which body provides oversight and appeals for the
   RSAB?  Discussions in the RFCED-Future Program have ruled out the
   ISOC Board of Trustees.  One possibility still under discussion is
   the IAB.

3.2.5.  Anti-Harassment Policy

   The IETF anti-harassment policy [11] also applies to the RSWG and
   RSAB, which strive to create and maintain an environment in which
   people of many different backgrounds are treated with dignity,
   decency, and respect.  Participants are expected to behave according
   to professional standards and demonstrate appropriate workplace
   behavior.  See also [RFC7154], [RFC7776], and [RFC8716].

4.  RFC Series Editor/Advisor (RSEA)

   NOTE: Discussion continues within the RFCED-Future Program regarding
   the roles and responsibilities of an expert in technical publication
   processes.  To retain flexibility (e.g., as to whether this
   individual plays more of an advisory role or more of a singular
   leadership role), this document temporarily refers to the individual
   as the "RFC Series Editor/Advisor" ("RSEA"), see also ISSUE #24 [12].

Internet-Draft             RFC Editor Model v3                 June 2021


   The RFC Series Editor/Advisor (RSEA) shall be a senior professional
   with deep knowledge of technical publishing.

   The primary responsibilities of the RSEA are as follows:

   o  Provide expert advice regarding policy proposals within the RSWG.

   o  Serve as a voting member on the RSAB.

   o  If requested, provide expert advice to the RPC and IETF LLC.

   Matters on which the RSEA might be consulted could include proposed
   changes to the RFC style guide [RFC7322], RFC formatting in general,
   web presence, copyright matters, archiving policy, and dissemination
   and cataloguing of RFCs.

4.1.  RSEA Selection

   The RSEA will be selected by a committee formed by the Executive
   Director of the IETF LLC, taking into account the role definition
   [13] and any detailed job description defined by the relevant parties
   (e.g., the Executive Director, other RSAB members, or RSWG chairs).
   The search committee may ask others to take part in the selection
   process in confidence.  The initial length of service shall be for
   one year, but then further extensions will be for three to five
   years.

4.2.  RSEA Performance Evaluation

   Periodically, the Executive Director will send out to the community a
   call for input on the performance of the RSEA.  The evaluation will
   be based on criteria specified in the role definition.  Criteria
   could include matters such as the following:

   o  Was the RSEA an active participant in RSWG/RSAB discussions and
      meetings?

   o  Did the RSEA provide useful advice to the RSWG and RPC?

   o  Did the RSEA exercise good judgment in RSAB decision making?

   o  Was the RSEA effective in advising the community on policy
      direction?

   The Executive Director will review the feedback, consulting with
   stream manager representatives, and then produce a recommendation to
   the IETF LLC Board.  The LLC will then make a decision, taking into
   account the Executive Director's recommendation.

Internet-Draft             RFC Editor Model v3                 June 2021


   Whether the RSEA role is structured as a contractual or employee
   relationship is a matter for the IETF LLC and its Executive Director
   to determine.

5.  Policy Implementation Function

5.1.  Roles and Processes

   Publication of RFCs shall be continue to be handled by the RFC
   Production Center (RPC) function in accordance with high-level
   policies currently in force or yet to be defined following the
   processes specified in the foregoing sections of this document.

   This document does not specify the exact relationship between the
   IETF LLC and the RPC function; for example, the RPC function could be
   provided by a separate corporate entity under contract to the IETF
   LLC, it could be performed by employees of the IETF LLC, or the IETF
   LLC could work with independent contractors for some or all aspects
   of the RPC function.  The exact relationship is a matter for the IETF
   LLC and its Executive Director to determine.

   The IETF LLC has authority over negotiating performance targets for
   the RPC and also has responsibility for ensuring that those targets
   are adhered to.  The IETF LLC is empowered to appoint a manager or to
   convene a committee to complete these activities.

   Community members who have concerns about the performance of the RPC
   can request that the IETF LLC look into the matter.  Even if the IETF
   LLC opts to delegate this activity, concerns should be raised with
   the IETF LLC.  The IETF LLC is ultimately responsible to the
   community via the mechanisms outlined in its charter.

5.2.  Editorial and Publication Policies

   Under and consistent with the high-level policies defined for the RFC
   Series in general or particular streams, the RPC shall define more
   particular policies regarding matters related to the editorial
   preparation and final publication and dissemination of RFCs.
   Examples include:

   o  Maintenance of a styleguide that defines editorial standards to
      which RFCs must adhere (see [RFC7322] and related updates).

   o  Policies regarding the file formats that are accepted as input to
      the editing and publication process.

   o  Policies regarding the final structure and layout of published
      documents; in the context of the XML vocabulary ([RFC7991]), such

Internet-Draft             RFC Editor Model v3                 June 2021


      policies could include matters such as the exact XML elements and
      attributes used to capture the semantic content of RFCs.

5.3.  Resolution of Disagreements between Authors and the RPC

   NOTE: This section is intended to address ISSUE #59 [14] and parts of
   ISSUE #6: Streams have content control [15].

   During the process of editorial preparation and publication,
   disagreements can arise between the authors of an RFC-to-be and the
   RPC.  Where an existing policy clearly applies, typically such
   disagreements are handled in a straightforward manner through direct
   consultation between the authors and the RPC, sometimes in
   collaboration with other individuals such as a document shepherd,
   IETF working group chair, IRSG research group chair, or IETF Area
   Director.

   However, if it is unclear whether an existing policy applies, or if
   the interpretation of an existing policy is unclear, the parties may
   need to consult with additional individuals or bodies (e.g., RSAB,
   IESG, IRSG, or stream manager) to help achieve a resolution.  The
   following points are intended to provide more particular guidance.

   o  If there is a conflict with a policy for a particular stream, the
      RPC should consult with the relevant stream manager to help
      achieve a resolution, if needed also conferring with a per-stream
      body such as the IESG or IRSG.

   o  If there is a conflict with a cross-stream policy, the RPC should
      consult with the RSAB to achieve a resolution.

   o  If the disagreement raises a new issue that is not covered by an
      existing policy or that cannot be resolved through consultation
      between the RPC and other relevant individuals and bodies as
      described above), the issue should be brought to the RSWG in order
      to formulate a new policy.  However, in the interest of time the
      disagreement may be resolved as the parties best see fit while the
      RSWG formulates a more general policy.

5.4.  Administrative Implementation

   The exact implementation of the administrative and contractual
   activities described here are a responsibility of the IETF LLC.

5.4.1.  Vendor Selection for the RFC Production Center

   Vendor selection is done in cooperation with the streams and under
   the final authority of the IETF LLC.

   The IETF LLC develops the work definition (the Statement of Work) for
   the RPC and manages the vendor selection process.  The work
   definition is created within the IETF LLC budget and takes into
   account the stream managers and community input.

   The process to select and contract for an RFC Production Center and
   other RFC-related services, is as follows:

   o  The IETF LLC establishes the contract process, including the steps
      necessary to issue an RFP when necessary, the timing, and the
      contracting procedures.

   o  The IETF LLC establishes the Selection Committee, which will
      consist of the IETF LLC Executive Director and other members
      selected by the IETF LLC in consultation with the stream managers.
      The Committee shall select a chair from among its members.

   o  The Selection Committee selects the vendor, subject to the
      successful negotiation of a contract approved by the IETF LLC.  In
      the event that a contract cannot be reached, the matter shall be
      referred to the Selection Committee for further action.

5.4.2.  Budget

   The expenses discussed in this document are not new expenses.  They
   have been and remain part of the IETF LLC budget.

   The RFC Series portion of the IETF LLC budget shall include funding
   to support the RSE/A, RFC Production Center, and the Independent
   Stream.

   The IETF LLC has the responsibility to approve the total RFC Editor
   budget (and the authority to deny it).  All relevant parties must
   work within the IETF LLC budgetary process.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines several functions within the overall RFC Editor
   structure, and it places the responsibility for coordination of
   registry value assignments with the RFC Production Center.  The IETF
   LLC will facilitate the establishment of the relationship between the
   RFC Production Center and IANA.

Internet-Draft             RFC Editor Model v3                 June 2021


   This document does not create a new registry nor does it register any
   values in existing registries, and no IANA action is required.

7.  Security Considerations

   The same security considerations as those in [RFC8729] apply.  The
   processes for the publication of documents must prevent the
   introduction of unapproved changes.  Since the RFC Editor maintains
   the index of publications, sufficient security must be in place to
   prevent these published documents from being changed by external
   parties.  The archive of RFC documents, any source documents needed
   to recreate the RFC documents, and any associated original documents
   (such as lists of errata, tools, and, for some early items, originals
   that are not machine readable) need to be secured against any kind of
   data storage failure.

   The IETF LLC should take these security considerations into account
   during the implementation and enforcement of the RFC Editor component
   contracts.

8.  Changes from Version 2 of the RFC Editor Model

8.1.  RFC Series Editor

   The RSWG and RSAB together provide a public process by which policies
   for the RFC series can be defined.  It is expected that these bodies
   will therefore cover some of the responsibilities of the RFC Series
   Editor under Version 2.

8.2.  RFC Series Oversight Committee (RSOC)

   In practice, the relationships and lines of authority and
   responsibility between the IAB, RSOC, and RSE have proved unwieldy
   and somewhat opaque.  To overcome some of these issues, this document
   dispenses with the RSOC.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.
