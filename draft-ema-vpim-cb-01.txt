1. Abstract 
    
   This document defines the expected behaviour of a client to   
   various aspects of a VPIM message or any voice or fax message. 
    
    
2. Conventions used in this document 
    
   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and 
   server respectively. 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [4]. 
    
    
3. Introduction 
    
   As Internet messaging evolves into Unified messaging, the term "e-
   mail" no longer refers to text-only messages.  Today's "e-mail" can 
   also have voice and/or fax parts, as well as text. 
    
   Each of voice, fax, and text have their own distinct characteristics, 
   which are intuitive to the user.  For example, each of these message 
   types require a different media viewer (text editor for text, audio 
   player for voice, and image viewer for fax), and the dimensions of 
   message size are also different for all three (kilobytes for text, 
   seconds for voice, and pages for fax). 
    
   How the messaging client responds to, and acts on these differences 
   is termed "Client Behaviour".  This is dependant on the concept of 
   "Message-Context" [2] (previously called primary content), which 
   defines whether the message is a voice mail, fax, or text message.  
   The client can utilize this header to determine the appropriate 
   client behaviour for a particular message.

4. Message Icon 
    
   The preferred method to distinguish between voice, fax, and text 
   messages is with a visual cue, or icon. 
    
   As it is possible for the message to contain more than one media 
   type, the icon should describe the primary message content, as 
   defined by the "Message-Context" header.  Obvious choices for the 
   icon/message pairs would be a telephone for a voice message, a fax 
   machine for a fax message, and an envelope for a text mail message. 
    
   This could be taken a step further, and have the icon change to 
   indicate that the message has been read (as is currently done in many 
   email clients).  For example, a telephone with the receiver off-hook 
   could indicate that the voice message has been played.  A fax  
   machine with paper at the bottom, as opposed to the top, would show 
   that the fax had been viewed.  Finally, as is currently the norm, an 
   open envelope indicates that a text message has been read. 
    
4.1 Proposed Mechanism 
    
   As the choice of icon is determined by the primary message type, the 
   client should obtain this information from the "Message-Context " 
   message header.  This header is defined in [2]. 
    
    
5. Sender's Number Column 

   As is the case with most email clients today, important message 
   information is organized into columns when presented to the user. 
   Typical columns include the message subject, and the date the message 
   was received. 
    
   Another important piece of information for the user is the origin of 
   the message.  For a voice or fax message, the origin is typically a 
   telephone or fax machine respectively, each of which has an 
   associated telephone number.  This telephone number is critical to 
   the user if they wish to return the call. 
    
5.1 Proposed Mechanism 

   There is currently a proposal to add a new Internet message header  
   to hold the originating telephone number [3].  If the message is 
   indicated as being a voice or fax message per [2], the client should 
   extract the number, and display it to the user in a separate column. 
   As this header is defined to only hold the digits of the telephone 
   number, it is left to the client to add any separating characters 
   (e.g. "-"). 
    
    
6. Message Size 
    
   In the cases of large attachments, small clients and slow links there 
   is also a need for the client to see the length of the message in a 
   suitable format before opening it.

   Currently, message size is normally given in kilobytes (kB).  This  
   is sufficient for plain text messages, but it is not very useful in 
   terms of voice and fax.  Instead, the size should give an indication 
   of the length of the message, i.e. the duration (in seconds) of a 
   voice message, and the number of pages of a fax.  Again, the message 
   may contain multiple types, so the size displayed should be that of 
   the primary content type, per [2]. 
    
6.1 Proposed Mechanisms 
    
   There are three suggested methods to relay this information, of them, 
   method 1 is favoured:  
    
6.1.1  MIME Header Content-Duration as described in RFC2424 [5] 
    
   For voice messages, the Content-Duration field of the main audio/* 
   body part (as indicated by content-disposition per [1]) should be 
   displayed as the length of the message.  If there are several audio 
   parts, an implementation may display the message size as an aggregate 
   of the length of each. 
    
   For fax messages a new MIME Header, Content-Page-Length, would be 
   defined, similar to Content-Duration with the exception that number 
   of pages would be specified, rather than number of seconds. (e.g. 
   Content-Page-Length:3).  This would be created at originator. 
    
    
6.1.2  Message length indicated as a parameter of an existing Content 
Header Field [7]. 
    
   This would be created at the source.  This method would allow the 
   message length to be passed to the client by default in IMAP.  Again 
   the client would have to chose between the main voice message length 
   or an aggregate message length for display. 
    
   Content-Type Header Field example: 
    
        Content-Type=audio/*; length=50 
        Content-Type=image/tiff; pages=3 
    
 
6.1.3  Message length indicated as part of an existing RFC822 Header 
Field [10]. 
    
   This field would be created at the source and may include message 
   length information, but because it is part of the message headers, it 
   could also be amended on reception (by a local process).  This method 
   would allow the message length to be passed to any client by default 
   and not require any client modification.  If used, this field would 
   indicate the aggregate length of all attachments. 
    
   Subject Header Field example: 
    
        Subject=Voice Message (0:04) 
        Subject=Fax Message (3p) 
 
    
7. Media Viewer

   When a message is initially opened, the client should, by default, 
   open the proper media viewer to display the primary message content, 
   i.e. an audio player for voice messages, image viewer for fax, and 
   text editor for text messages. 
    
   Where there is more than one body part, obviously the appropriate 
   viewer should be used depending on which body part the user has 
   selected. 
    
   In the case where several viewers are available for a single media 
   type, the user should be prompted to select the desired viewer on 
   the first occasion that the message type is encountered.  That 
   viewer should then become the default viewer for that media type. 
    
   The user should have the ability to change the default viewer for a 
   media type at any time. 
    
7.1 Proposed Mechanism 
    
   As mentioned, the default viewer displayed to the user should be the 
   appropriate one for the primary message type.  The client is able to 
   determine the primary message type from the "Message-Context" 
   message header per [2]. 
    
    
8. Mark Message as Read 
    
   Obviously, the user must be able to know which messages they have 
   read, and which are unread.  This feature would also control the 
   message icon as mentioned in section 1. 
    
   With the proliferation of voice and fax messages, clients should only 
   indicate that these messages are read when the primary body part has 
   been read. The default is currently to mark a message read, when the 
   first body part (typically text) is viewed. 
    
8.1 Proposed Mechanism 
    
   Implementation of this feature on most clients is a local issue. 
    
   IMAP4 [6] clients should only set \SEEN flag after the first 
   attachment of the primary content type has been opened.   
   For example, if the message context is voice message  , the \SEEN 
   flag would be set after the primary voice message (indicated by 
   content-disposition [1] or content-criticality [8]) is opened.  
 
    
9. Security Considerations 
    
   The desirable client behaviours described here are intended to 
   provide the user with a better desktop experience.  However, it is 
   open to the same risks as any mail client.  That is, the client is 
   not responsible for the format of the message received, it only 
   interprets.  As a result, messages could be spoofed or masqueraded 
   to look like a message they are not to elicit a desired client 
   behaviour.  This could be used to fool the end user, for example,

   into thinking a message was a voice message (because of the icon) 
   when it was not.
