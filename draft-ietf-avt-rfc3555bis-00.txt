                                Abstract

     This document defines the procedure to register RTP Payload Formats
     as audio, video or other MIME subtype names.  This is useful in a
     text-based format or control protocol to identify the type of an
     RTP transmission.  This document also registers all the RTP payload
     formats defined in the RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences
     as MIME subtypes.  Some of these may also be used for transfer
     modes other than RTP.

1.  Introduction

The MIME registration procedure described in RFC 2048 [1] was originally
designed for transport of multimedia information via asynchronous
Internet mail, but the MIME namespace now provides identification for
other transport modes as well.  Updated registration procedures are
specified in [2].  This document defines the procedure to register MIME
subtype names for use with the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP), RFC
3550 [3], to identify RTP payload formats.

This document also registers all the RTP payload formats defined in the
RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences, RFC 3551 [4], as MIME
subtypes under the "audio" and "video" MIME types.

1.1.  IANA Considerations

This document registers the following MIME subtypes:

     audio/DVI4
     audio/G722
     audio/G723
     audio/G726-16
     audio/G726-24
     audio/G726-32
     audio/G726-40
     audio/G728
     audio/G729
     audio/G729D
     audio/G729E

MIME subtype audio/L16 has already been registered via RFC 2586 for
transports other than RTP.  That registration is incorporated here and
augmented with additional information for RTP transport.

1.2.  Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [5] and indicate
requirement levels for implementations compliant with this
specification.

2.  Procedure For Registering MIME Types for RTP Payload Types

Registering an RTP payload type as a MIME type follows the same
procedures as described in [2] and uses the registration template shown
in Section 10 of [2].  Some additional parameters are required to
specify how a particular payload format is transported over RTP:

     Published specification
          A description of the media encoding and a specification of the
          payload format must be provided, usually by reference to an
          RTP payload format specification RFC.  That RFC may be
          separate, or the MIME subtype registration may be incorporated
          into the payload format specification RFC.  The payload format
          specification MUST include the RTP timestamp clock rate (or
          multiple rates for audio encodings with multiple sampling
          rates).

          A reference to a further description of the data compression
          format itself should be provided, if available.

Internet Draft      draft-ietf-avt-rfc3555bis-00.txt             July 10


     Required parameters
          If the payload format does not have a fixed RTP timestamp
          clock rate, then a "rate" parameter is required to specify the
          RTP timestamp clock rate.  A particular payload format may
          have additional required parameters.

     Optional parameters
          Most audio payload formats can have an optional "channels"
          parameter to specify the number of audio channels included in
          the transmission.  Any payload format, but most likely audio
          formats, may also include the optional parameters "ptime", to
          specify the recommended length of time in milliseconds
          represented by the media in a packet, and/or "maxptime" to
          specify the maximum amount of media which can be encapsulated
          in each packet, expressed as time in milliseconds.  The
          "ptime" and "maxptime" parameters are defined in the Session
          Description Protocol (SDP) [6].

          A particular payload format may have additional optional
          parameters.

     Encoding considerations
          Most RTP payload formats include binary or framed data as
          described in Section 4.8 of [2].  The appropriate encoding
          considerations MUST be noted.

     Restrictions on usage:
          The fact that the type is defined for transfer via RTP MUST be
          noted, in particular if the transfer depends on RTP framing
          and hence the type is only defined for transfer via RTP.

Depending on whether the type has already been registered for transfer
with a non-RTP protocol (e.g. MIME mail or http) or not, several
different cases can occur:

     a) Not yet registered as a MIME type

        A new registration should be constructed using the MIME
        registration template.  The registration may specify transfer
        via other means in addition to RTP if that is feasible and
        desired.  The appropriate encoding considerations must be
        specified, and the restrictions on usage must specify whether
        the type is only defined for transfer via RTP or via other modes
        as well.

        Optional parameters may be defined as needed, and it must be
        clearly stated to which mode(s) of transfer the parameters
        apply.

Internet Draft      draft-ietf-avt-rfc3555bis-00.txt             July 10


     b) MIME type exists for a non-RTP protocol

        The restrictions on usage of the existing type should be
        changed, if present, or added, if not, to indicate that the type
        can also be transferred via RTP.

        RTP-specific parameters may be added, and it must be clearly
        stated that these are only to be used when the media type is
        transmitted via RTP transport.

     c) Update an existing MIME type for RTP to be used for a non-RTP
        protocol

        The restrictions on usage of the existing type should be changed
        to indicate that the type can also be transferred via a non-RTP
        protocol (e.g. SMTP, HTTP).

        Non-RTP-specific parameters can be added, and it must be clearly
        stated that these are only to be used when the media type is
        transmitted via a non-RTP transport.

2.1.  Restrictions on Sharing a Type

The same MIME type MUST NOT be shared for RTP and non-RTP (file-based)
transfer methods unless the data format is the same for both methods.
The data format is considered to be same if the file format is
equivalent to a concatenated sequence of payloads from RTP packets not
including the RTP header or any payload-format header.

The file format MAY include a magic number or other header at the start
of the file that is not included when the data is transferred via RTP.

A second requirement for sharing a MIME type is that the sets of
required parameters must be the same for both methods.

For cases where the data format or required parameters cannot be the
same for RTP and non-RTP transfer methods, then the data formats MUST be
registered as separate types.  It is RECOMMENDED that the type names be
related, such as by using a common root plus a suffix.

3.  Mapping to SDP Parameters

The representation of a MIME media type is specified in the syntax of
the Content-Type header field in RFC 2045 [7] as follows:

     type "/" subtype  *(";" parameter)

Internet Draft      draft-ietf-avt-rfc3555bis-00.txt             July 10


Parameters may be required for a particular type or subtype or they may
be optional.  For media types which represent RTP payload formats, the
parameters "rate", "channels", "ptime", and "maxptime" have general
definitions (given above) that may apply across types and subtypes.  The
format for a parameter is specified in RFC 2045 as

     attribute "=" value

where attribute is the parameter name and the permissible values are
specified for each parameter.  The value may need to be a quoted string
if it contains any of the special characters listed in RFC 2045.

The information carried in the media type string has a specific mapping
to fields in the Session Description Protocol (SDP) [6], which is
commonly used to describe RTP sessions.  The mapping is as follows:

    o  The MIME type (e.g., audio) goes in SDP "m=" as the media name.

    o  The MIME subtype (payload format) goes in SDP "a=rtpmap" as the
       encoding name.

    o  The general (possibly optional) parameters "rate" and "channels"
       also go in "a=rtpmap" as clock rate and encoding parameters,
       respectively.

    o  The general (and optional) parameters "ptime" and "maxptime" go
       in the SDP "a=ptime" and "a=maxptime" attributes, respectively.

    o  Any payload-format-specific parameters go in the SDP "a=fmtp"
       attribute.  The set of allowed parameters is defined by the RFC
       that specifies the payload format and MUST NOT be extended by the
       MIME subtype registration without a corresponding revision of the
       payload format specification.  The format and syntax of these
       parameters may also be defined by the payload format
       specification, but it is suggested that the parameters be copied
       directly from the MIME media type string as a semicolon separated
       list of parameter=value pairs.  For payload formats that specify
       some other syntax for the fmtp parameters, the registration of
       that payload format as a MIME subtype must specify what the
       parameters are in MIME format and how to map them to the SDP
       "a=fmtp" attribute.  See Section 4.1.21 for an example.

An example mapping is as follows:

        a=rtpmap:97 L16/48000/2
        a=fmtp:97 emphasis=50-15
        a=ptime:5

Note that the payload format (encoding) names defined in the RTP Profile
are commonly shown in upper case.  MIME subtypes are commonly shown in
lower case.  These names are case-insensitive in both places.
Similarly, parameter names are case-insensitive both in MIME types and
in the default mapping to the SDP a=fmtp attribute.

4.  Registrations for "Audio/Video Profile"

In the following sections, all RTP payload formats described in the RTP
Profile for Audio and Video Conferences, RFC 3551 [4], are registered as
MIME subtypes.

4.1.  Audio Type Registrations

The following sections register all of the RTP audio payload types
defined in RFC 3551 as MIME types.

For most audio payload formats, the RTP timestamp clock rate is equal to
the sampling rate.  Some payload formats operate only at one fixed
sampling rate, while others are adjustable.

4.1.1.  Registration of MIME media type audio/DVI4

     MIME media type name: audio

     MIME subtype name: DVI4

     Required parameters: rate
          The RTP timestamp clock rate, which is equal to the sampling
          rate.  The typical rate is 8000, but other rates may be
          specified.

     Optional parameters: ptime, maxptime

     Encoding considerations:
          This media type is framed binary data (see section 4.8 in
          [2]).

     Security considerations: See Section 5 of RFC 3555

4.1.15.  Registration of MIME media type audio/L16

MIME subtype audio/L16 has already been registered via RFC 2586 for
transports other than RTP.  That registration is incorporated here and
augmented with additional information for RTP transport.

     MIME media type name: audio

     MIME subtype name: L16

     Required parameters
          rate: number of samples per second -- For non-RTP transport,



                          Expires January 2006               [Page 19]

Internet Draft      draft-ietf-avt-rfc3555bis-00.txt             July 10


          the permissible values for rate are 8000, 11025, 16000, 22050,
          24000, 32000, 44100, and 48000 samples per second.  For RTP
          transport, other values are permissible but the aforementioned
          values are RECOMMENDED.  For RTP, the rate parameter indicates
          the RTP timestamp clock rate, which is equal to the sample
          rate.

     Optional parameters
          channels: how many audio streams are interleaved -- defaults
          to 1; stereo would be 2, etc.  Interleaving takes place
          between individual two-byte samples.

          emphasis: analog preemphasis applied to the signal before
          quantization.  The only emphasis value defined here is
          emphasis=50-15 to indicate the 50/15 microsecond preemphasis
          used with Compact Disks.  This parameter MUST be omitted if no
          analog preemphasis was applied.

          channel-order: specifies the sample interleaving order for
          multiple-channel audio streams (see [8] Section 7).
          Permissible values are DV.LRLsRs, DV.LRCS, DV.LRCWo,
          DV.LRLsRsC, DV.LRLsRsCS, DV.LmixRmixTWoQ1Q2,
          DV.LRCWoLsRsLmixRmix, DV.LRCWoLs1Rs1Ls2Rs2, DV.LRCWoLsRsLcRc.
          For interoperation with DV video systems, only a subset of
          these channel combinations is specified for use with 20-bit
          linear encoding in the DV video specification [5]; those are
          DV.LRLsRs, DV.LRCS, DV.LmixRmixTWoQ1Q2.  This parameter MUST
          be omitted when the AIFF-C channel order convention (see RFC
          3551) is in use.

          For RTP, ptime: RECOMMENDED duration of each packet in
          milliseconds.

          For RTP, maxptime: maximum duration of each packet in
          milliseconds.

     Encoding considerations
          Audio data is binary data, and must be encoded for non-binary
          transport; the Base64 encoding is suitable for Email.  Note
          that audio data does not compress easily using lossless
          compression.

     Security considerations
          Audio data is believed to offer no security risks.
          See Section 5 of RFC 3555.

     Interoperability considerations
          This type is compatible with the encoding used in the WAV

     Intended usage
          Common

          It is expected that many audio and speech applications will
          use this type.  Already the most popular platforms provide
          this type with the rate=11025 parameter referred to as "radio
          quality speech."

     Restrictions on usage
          In addition to file-based transfer methods, this type is also
          defined for transfer via RTP [RFC 3550].

     Optional parameters:
          layer: which layer of MPEG audio encoding; permissible values
          are 1, 2, 3.

          samplerate: the rate at which audio is sampled.  MPEG-1 audio
          supports sampling rates of 32, 44.1, and 48 kHz; MPEG-2
          supports sampling rates of 16, 22.05 and 24 kHz.  This
          parameter is separate from the RTP timestamp clock rate which
          is always 90000 Hz for MPA.

          mode: permissible values are "stereo", "joint_stereo",
          "single_channel", "dual_channel".  The "channels" parameter
          does not apply to MPA.  It is undefined to put a number of
          channels in the SDP rtpmap attribute for MPA.

          bitrate: the data rate for the audio bit stream.

4.1.21.  Registration of MIME media type audio/RED

     MIME media type name: audio

     MIME subtype name: RED

     Required parameters:
          pt: a comma-separated list of RTP payload types.  Because
          comma is a special character, the list must be a quoted-string
          (enclosed in double quotes).  For static payload types, each
          list element is simply the type number.  For dynamic payload
          types, each list element is a mapping of the dynamic payload
          type number to an embedded MIME content-type specification for
          the payload format corresponding to the dynamic payload type.
          The format of the mapping is:

             dynamic-payload-type "=" content-type

          If the content-type string includes a comma, then the content-
          type string MUST be a quoted-string.  If the content-type
          string does not include a comma, it MAY still be quoted.
          Since it is part of the list which must itself be a quoted-
          string, that means the quotation marks MUST be quoted with
          backslash quoting as specified in RFC 2045.  If the content-
          type string itself contains a quoted-string, then the
          requirement for backslash quoting is recursively applied.  To
          specify the audio/RED payload format in SDP, the pt parameter
          is mapped to an a=fmtp attribute by eliminating the parameter
          name (pt) and changing the commas to slashes.  For example,
          'pt="0,5"' maps to 'a=fmtp:99 0/5'.  A more complicated
          example, with a dynamic payload type, is:

             pt = "0, 103 = \"audio/G729D;annexb=yes\" "

             m=audio 49170 RTP/AVP 99 0 103
             a=rtpmap:99 RED/8000
             a=fmtp:99 0/103
             a=rtpmap:103 G729D/8000
             a=fmtp:103 annexb=yes

4.2.  Video Type Registrations

For all of the video payload formats registered here, the RTP timestamp
clock rate is always 90000 Hz, so the "rate" parameter is not
applicable.  Likewise, the "channel" parameter is not used with video,
and while "ptime" and "maxptime" could be used with video, they
typically are not.

5.  Changes from RFC 3555

This document updates RFC 3555 to conform to the revised MIME type
registration procedures in [2].  Whereas RFC 3555 required the encoding
considerations to specify transfer via RTP, that is now specified under
restrictions on usage.  This document also adds a new Section 2.1 to
clarify the requirements for sharing a MIME type among RTP and non-RTP
transfer methods.

6.  Security Considerations

The MIME subtype registration procedure specified in this memo does not
impose any security considerations on its own.  This memo also contains
several MIME type registrations.  The registrations themselves do not
impose security risks, but some may state security considerations
specific to the particular registration.

Several audio and video encodings are perfect for hiding data using
steganography.

The RTP specification, RFC 3550, provides security considerations for
the transport of audio and video data over RTP, including the use of
encryption where confidentiality is required.
