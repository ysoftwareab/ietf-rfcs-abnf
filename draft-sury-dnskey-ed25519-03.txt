1.  Introduction

   DNSSEC, which is broadly defined in [RFC4033], [RFC4034], and
   [RFC4035], uses cryptographic keys and digital signatures to provide
   authentication of DNS data.  Currently, the most popular signature
   algorithm in use is RSA.  [RFC5933] and [RFC6605] later defined the
   use of GOST and NIST specified elliptic curve cryptography in DNSSEC.

   This document defines the use of DNSSEC's DS, DNSKEY, and RRSIG
   resource records (RRs) with a new signing algorithm: the Ed25519
   instance of the Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA)
   used with the SHA-512 hash algorithm.  A more thorough description of
   Ed25519 can be found in [I-D.josefsson-eddsa-ed25519].

   Ed25519 has a 128-bit security target, which is considered to be
   equivalent in strength to RSA with ~3000-bit keys.  Ed25519 public
   keys are 256 bits (32 bytes) long while signatures are 512 bits (64
   bytes) long.

   The usage of the Ed25519 algorithm in DNSSEC has advantages and
   disadvantages relative to RSA.  Ed25519 keys are much shorter than
   RSA keys.  At comparable strengths, Ed25519 keys are 352 bytes
   smaller than RSA-3072 keys.  Similarly, an Ed25519 signature saves
   320 bytes over an RSA-3072 signature.

   However, DNSSEC with RSA is not commonly deployed on the Internet
   with signatures as large as 3072 bits.  [RFC6781] contemplates the
   routine use of RSA-1024 and RSA-2048 in DNSSEC.  Even when compared
   to the use of RSA at reduced strengths, Ed25519 still provides
   substantially smaller keys and signatures.

   Signing with Ed25519 is significantly faster than signing with
   equivalently strong RSA, and it is also faster than signing with the

   existing ECDSA algorithms defined in [RFC6605].  However, the
   validation of RSA signatures is significantly faster than the
   validation of Ed25519 signatures.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  DNSKEY and RRSIG Resource Records for Ed25519

   An Ed25519 public key consists of a 32-byte value that represents the
   compressed encoding of the curve point, which is encoded into the
   Public Key field of a DNSKEY resource record as a simple bit string.
   The generation of a public key is defined in Chapter 5.5 in
   [I-D.josefsson-eddsa-ed25519].

   An Ed25519 signature consists of a 64-byte value, which is encoded
   into the Signature field of an RRSIG resource record as a simple bit
   string.  The Ed25519 signature algorithm is described in Chapter 5.6
   in [I-D.josefsson-eddsa-ed25519].

   The algorithm number associated with the use of Ed25519 with SHA-512
   in DS, DNSKEY and RRSIG resource records is TBD.  This registration
   is fully defined in the IANA Considerations section.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document updates the IANA registry "Domain Name System Security
   (DNSSEC) Algorithm Numbers".  The following entry has been added to
   the registry:

                  | Description  | Ed25519 with SHA-512 |
                  | Mnemonic     | ED25519SHA512        |

    * There has been no determination of standardization of the use of
                 this algorithm with Transaction Security.

7.  Implementation Status

   (Note to the RFC Editor: please remove this entire section as well as
   the reference to RFC 6982 before publication.)

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC6982].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [RFC6982], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

   TODO: Fill out this section.

8.  Security Considerations

   Ed25519 is targeted to provide attack resistance comparable to
   quality 128-bit symmetric ciphers.  Such an assessment could, of
   course, change in the future if new attacks that work better than the
   ones known today are found.
