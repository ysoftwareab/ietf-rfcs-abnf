                    IPv6 Universal Extension Header
           draft-gont-6man-ipv6-universal-extension-header-02

Abstract

   In IPv6, optional internet-layer information is encoded in separate
   headers that may be placed between the IPv6 header and the transport-
   layer header.  There are a small number of such extension headers
   currently defined.  This document describes the issues that can arise
   when defining new extension headers and specifies a new IPv6
   Extension Header - the Universal Extension Header - that overcomes
   the aforementioned problem, while enabling the extensibility of IPv6.
   Finally, this document formally obsoletes RFC 6564.

1.  Introduction

   There has recently been a lot of work in the area of IPv6 Extension
   Headers.  Firstly, there has been research about the extent to which
   IPv6 packets employing Extension Headers are dropped in the public
   Internet [GONT-IEPG-Nov13] [GONT-IEPG-Mar14], and debate about the
   motivation behind such policy [I-D.gont-v6ops-ipv6-ehs-packet-drops].
   Secondly, there has been a fair share of work to improve some
   technicalities of IPv6 Extension Headers (see e.g.  [RFC7112]
   [RFC7045]) in the hopes that they can be reliably used in the public
   Internet.

   A key challenge for IPv6 Extension Headers to be "deployable" in the
   public Internet is that they should not impair any nodes's ability to
   process the entire IPv6 header chain.  One of the steps meant in that
   direction has been the specification of a Uniform Format for IPv6
   Extension Headers [RFC6564], which was meant to be employed by any
   IPv6 Extension Headers that might be defined in the future, such that
   middle-boxes can still process the entire IPv6 header chain if new
   new extension headers were specified.  However, a problem in the

Internet-Draft         Universal Extension Header         September 2015


   aforementioned specification prevents such uniform format from being
   of use.

   Section 3 discusses the aforementioned flaw in the Uniform Format for
   Extension Headers specified in [RFC6564].  Section 4 explicitly
   describes the implications of the aforementioned flaw.  Section 5
   specifies the new Universal Extension Header (UEH).  Section 7
   explains how new IPv6 extensions would be specified with the UEH.
   Section 6 formally forbids the specification of new IPv6 Extension
   Headers (with new Next Header values), and mandates that any new IPv6
   extensions be conveyed/encoded in the UEH specified in this document.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  A Problem with RFC 6564

   A key problem with the Uniform Format for IPv6 Extension Headers
   [RFC6564] lies in that both IPv6 Extension Headers and Transport
   Protocols share the same "Next Header" registry/namespace.  Thus,
   given an "unknown Next Header value", it is impossible to tell
   whether the aforementioned value refers to an IPv6 Extension Header
   that employs the aforementioned uniform format, or an "unknown"
   upper-layer protocol (e.g. an "unknown" transport protocol).  That
   is, while [RFC6564] specifies the syntax for a Uniform Format for
   IPv6 Extension Headers, it does not provide a mechanism for a node to
   identify whether the aforementioned format is being employed in the
   first place.

4.  Implications

   The current impossibility to parse an IPv6 header chain that includes
   unknown Next Header values results in concrete implications for the
   extensibility of the IPv6 protocol, and the deployability of new
   transport protocols.  Namely,

   o  New IPv6 extension headers cannot be incrementally deployed.

   o  New transport protocols cannot be incrementally deployed.

   Since there is no way for a node to process IPv6 extension headers
   that employ unknown next header values, an IPv6 host that receives a
   packet that employs a new IPv6 extension header will not be able to
   parse the IPv6 header chain past that unknown extension header, and
   hence it will drop the aforementioned packet

Internet-Draft         Universal Extension Header         September 2015


   [I-D.gont-v6ops-ipv6-ehs-packet-drops].  In a similar way, a
   middlebox that needs to process the transport-protocol header will be
   faced with the dilemma of what to do with packets that employ unknown
   Next Header values.  Since they will not be able to parse the IPv6
   header chain past the unknown Next Header, it is very likely that
   they will drop such packets.

   Unfortunately, since transport protocols share the same namespace as
   IPv6 Extension Headers, new transport protocols will pose the same
   challenge to middle-boxes, and hence they will be likely dropped in
   the network.

   We believe that the current situation has implications that are
   generally overlooked, and that, whatever the outcome, it should be
   the result of an explicit decision by our community, rather than
   simply "omission".

5.  UEH Specification

   This document specifies a new IPv6 Extension Header: Universal
   Extension Header.  This Extension Header is identified by the value
   [TBD] of [IANA-IP-PROTO].  The syntax of the Universal Extension
   Header is:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |  Next Header  |  Hdr Ext Len  |    Subtype    |               |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+               +
      |                                                               |
      .                                                               .
      .                   Subtype Specific Data                        .
      .                                                               .
      |                                                               |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   where:

   Next Header
      8-bit selector.  Identifies the type of header immediately
      following the extension header.  Uses the same values as the IPv4
      Protocol field [IANA-IP-PROTO].

   Hdr Ext Len
      8-bit unsigned integer.  Length of the extension header in 8-octet
      units, not including the first 8 octets.

Internet-Draft         Universal Extension Header         September 2015


   Subtype
      8-bit unsigned integer.  Specifies the subtype for this extension
      header.  It uses a new namespace managed by IANA [IANA-UEH].

   Subtype Specific Data
      Variable length.  Fields specific to this extension header/
      Subtype.

   The Universal Extension Header specified in this document MAY appear
   multiple times in the same IPv6 packet.

6.  Forbidding New IPv6 Extension Headers

   Since the specification of any new IPv6 Extension Headers (i.e., with
   new Next Header values) would hamper (among other things) the
   incremental deployment of extensions and new transport protocols, and
   basic operational practices suchas as the enforcement of simple ACLs,
   new IPv6 Extension Headers MUST NOT be specified in any future
   specifications.  Any IPv6 extensions that would require a new IPv6
   Extension Header MUST be implemented with the Universal Extension
   Header specified in this document.  This minimizes breakage in
   intermediate nodes that need to parse the entire IPv6 header chain.

7.  Operation of the UEH

   This section describes the operation of the Universal Extension
   Header.

   The goal of the UEH is to provide a common syntax for all future IPv6
   extensions.  Any future extension headers will be encoded in a UEH,
   and will be identified by a specific UEH Subtype assigned by IANA at
   the time the corresponding specification is published.  The UEH thus
   provides the "common syntax" required to process "unrecognized
   extensions", and the Subtype field identifies the specific extension
   being encoded in the UEH.  Any "future extension headers" would
   actually be new Subtypes (assigned by IANA) of the UEH.

   As a result, unrecognized Next Header values should be interpreted to
   identify an upper-layer protocol, rather than an IPv6 extension
   header.

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to create a new registry to maintain the Universal
   Extension Header Subtypes [IANA-UEH].

9.  Security Considerations

   Enabling nodes to parse an entire IPv6 header chain even in the
   presence of unrecognized extensions allows for security mechanisms to
   be implemented and deployed.
