  Abstract 

     This document defines an additional set of extended status codes based 
     on new messaging applications and associated error states since the 
     creation of the original RFC 1893 document.  These include extended 
     media conversion codes for fax and voice messaging and results for 
     message tracking.

  1. Overview 

     VPIM and iFAX have identified additional, interesting error cases 
     important to enumerate.  Operational experience has also suggested 
     additional codes useful to diagnose messaging system failures. 

  2. New Status Codes 

     Here they are. 

  2.1 Network and Routing Status 

     Keith Moore thought this might be a good addition. 

          X.4.8  Misrouted message 

                 A message was improperly routed to this MTA or gateway.  
                 This may have happened, for instance, because an MX 
                 record for the recipient's domain inappropriately 
                 directed traffic to the MTA, or because another MTA was 
                 inappropriately (and explicitly) configured to direct 
                 traffic for this recipient to the MTA reporting the 
                 error.   

                 It can also indicate a failure to properly configure the 
                 reporting MTA, when the MTA administrator intended that
                 the MTA would accept traffic for recipients in that 
                 domain.

  2.2 Media Gateway Encodings 

     Experience with media translating gateways has demonstrated a need for 
     a richer set of error codes.  These codes provide additional detail 
     useful to enable an end-user to re-compose and resend a message more 
     likely to succeed. 

          X.6.6   Fax media not supported 

                 Fax media is not supported by either the delivery 
                 protocol or the next system in the forwarding path. This 
                 error in a successful DSN indicates the message was 
                 delivered without the offending content.  

          X.6.7   Fax encoding not supported 

                 While fax media is supported, the specific fax encoding 
                 sent is not supported. This error in a successful DSN 
                 indicates the message was delivered without the offending 
                 content.  

          X.6.8   Voice media not supported 

                 Voice media is not supported by either the delivery 
                 protocol or the next system in the forwarding path. This 
                 error in a successful DSN indicates the message was 
                 delivered without the offending content. 

          X.6.9   Voice encoding not supported 

                 While voice media is supported, the specific audio 
                 encoding sent is not supported. This error in a 
                 successful DSN indicates the message was delivered 
                 without the offending content. 

          X.6.10 Text not supported 

                 Text media is not supported by either the delivery 
                 protocol or the next system in the forwarding path. This 
                 error in a successful DSN indicates the message was 
                 delivered without the offending content.  

          X.6.11 Text Character set not supported 

                 While Text media is supported, the specific character set 
                 or other encoding is not supported. This error in a 
                 successful DSN indicates the message was delivered 
                 without the offending content.

          X.6.12 Attachment type not supported 

                 The attachment is not supported by either the delivery 
                 protocol or the next system in the forwarding path.  An 
                 attachment is a content with a content-disposition of 
                 `
                 the message was delivered without the offending content. 

          X.6.13 Attachment too large 

                 The attachment is too large for the recipient mail system 
                 or protocol.  This error in a successful DSN indicates 
                 the message was delivered without the offending content.

  4. Security Considerations 

     This document describes additional status codes to describe failure 
     conditions with increased precision.  Use of these status codes may 
     disclose additional information about how an internal mail system is 
     implemented and it's capabilities beyond that currently available.
