Abstract 
    
   A solution for GMPLS implementation using 48bits of Ethernet 
   multicast address as label is proposed. It is claimed that Ethernet 
   bridges supporting IEEE 802.1D-2004 and IEEE 802.1Q-2003 may 
   implement GMPLS according to this proposal without requiring 
   modification to data plane, hence this solution is an appropriate 
   candidate solution for GELS (GMPLS Ethernet Label Switching) group. 
   The LSP established in this method is intrinsically bi-directional. 
   Ethernet bridges of this implementation provide traffic engineered 
   frame delivery path. Any point-to-point LSP can be transformed to 
   multi-point LSP, and vice versa. It is interoperable with 802.1D/Q 
   bridges. This proposal allows automated setup of VLAN using GMPLS in 
   small scale network. IEEE 802.1 controlled spanning tree path may co-
   exist with GMPLS controlled LSP path when VLAN is used for 
   segregating GMPLS flows and normal Ethernet flows. Clear advantage of 
   this proposal compared to all-router based backbone network is cost-
   effectiveness that it helps reducing CAPEX/OPEX of operators. With 
   the aid of well-established IP technology, it also helps enhancing 
   scalability and manageability of bridged backbone network.

1.   Introduction 
    
   GMPLS control over Ethernet as specified in GMPLS RFCs has been 
   identified within the scope of the CCAMP working group. GELS (GMPLS 
   Ethernet Label Switching) group has been proposed in this initiative 
   to find best approach for GMPLS implementation over IEEE bridges. A 
   strong requirement raised in the group is that any potential proposal 
   must not assume modification of Ethernet data plane for this 
   implementation, other than currently defined or pledged to be 
   supported in IEEE.  
    
   This document is a revision to original proposal of LSE (Label 
   Switching Ethernet) architecture to meet the requirement. Main 
   objective of this solution is to configure 48bits of MAC addresses in 
   Filtering Database (FDB) using GMPLS in order to provide scalable TE 
   path. However, this proposal also doesn't preclude use of GMPLS for 
   configuring VLAN in limited scale of network. In order to achieve 
   this, this proposal utilizes Extended Filtering Service defined in 
   IEEE 802.1D-2004 [IEEE8021D], and Enhanced Internal Sublayer Service 
   (EISS) defined in 802.1Q-2003 [IEEE8021Q]. 
    
   It is allowed in [IEEE8021D] that group forwarding entry (i.e. 
   Ethernet multicast address) can be configured either through 
   management control or using GMRP (GARP Multicast Registration 
   Protocol). In IEEE term, when multicast address is configured using 
   management primitives, it is called static filtering entry. If the 
   multicast address is configured by GMRP using control primitives, it 
   is called dynamic group registration entry. Both types of entries are 
   not subject to MAC learning or aging timer that once the address is 
   configured in FDB, the frame forwarding path is fixed unless the node 
   fails. Using this group forwarding behavior, GMPLS control entity may 
   configure point-to-point or multi-point LSP over 802.1D network.  
    
   Other useful feature defined in [IEEE8021D] is default filtering 
   behavior of unknown group address. When it is enabled, any reception 
   of unregistered multicast frames will be silently discarded. This 
   behavior is very useful in preventing looping or flooding of unknown 
   Ethernet frames. Note that Ethernet bridges usually broadcast data 
   frames via spanning tree when the destination address is unknown. 
   Since GMPLS may disable spanning tree or open all ports as forwarding 
   state in order to provide shortest path via any port, broadcasting 
   behavior of unknown frame may cause fatal result. However, when 
   multicast address is used in destination address field, this risk can 
   be reduced because bridges will discard unknown multicast frames. 
   Hence it is safer for GMPLS to control multicast Ethernet frames 
   rather than unicast Ethernet frames. Further, [IEEE8021D] defines 
   several useful tools for controlling multicast traffic, such as 
   selective permission or blocking of group addresses, that it will

   facilitate future extension of GMPLS implementation to multi-point 
   Ethernet service.  
    
   The other good reason to use multicast address for GMPLS label is 
   that point-to-point LSP may seamlessly be converted to multi-point 
   LSP or vice versa, because the LSP is inherently a multicast 
   forwarding path. It only requires some port map manipulation of the 
   group forwarding entry in FDB to transform point-to-point path to 
   multipoint path.  
    
   For these reasons, this proposal utilizes group forwarding behavior 
   of Extended Filtering Service defined in IEEE 802.1D-2004 edition for 
   GMPLS implementation.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [i]. 
    
    
3.   GMPLS Label Format 
    
   Figure 1 below shows the proposed format of Ethernet multicast 
   address when GMPLS label is encoded. According to IEEE 802 standard 
   [IEEE802], 48bits of LAN MAC address consists of upper 24bits of OUI 
   (Organizationally Unique Identifiers) field and lower 24bits of 
   remaining part. IEEE allows individual organization generating LAN 
   MAC address using lower 24 bits of address block when unique OUI code 
   is obtained from IEEE. This allows exclusive use of approximately 16 
   million addresses for each organization.  
    
   Using the addressing scheme, GMPLS may secure 24bits size of label 
   space when an OUI number is reserved from IEEE for this protocol. 
   This allows approximately 16 million LSPs established per 
   administrative domain when the label is used globally in an intra-
   domain. When several more OUI numbers are reserved for GMPLS, the 
   size of label space doubles. All Ethernet frames controlled by GMPLS 
   will have identical OUI number that they can easily be classified 
   from other Ethernet frames.  
    
   In order to apply default group filtering behavior to GMPLS frames, 
   this proposal recommends use of group prefixed OUI number for GMPLS. 
   In IEEE address format [IEEE802], the last bit setting of the first 
   octet in OUI number indicates that the address type is group 
   multicast.

   Figure 1. GMPLS Frame Format 
    
    
   The GMPLS frame header shown in Figure 1 contains two group addresses, 
   DA-label and SA-label. The DA-label is used for forwarding the frame, 
   and the SA-label indicates LSP of backward direction. Since GMPLS 
   supports bi-directional LSP [RFC3945], this proposal recommends 
   inclusion of backward label in all frame header. It also aligns with 
   semantics of Ethernet header. In future extension, the information of 
   backward LSP may be used for sending OAM message back to ingress node 
   when corresponding data plane entity for OAM is developed in IEEE. 
    
   Use of Ethertype code or VLAN tag is orthogonal in this proposal. 
   However when VLAN tag is attached to GMPLS prefixed frames, GMPLS 
   controlled traffic can be separate from normal Ethernet traffic in 
   underlying port level. This allows IEEE 802.1 spanning tree path 
   coexists with GMPLS controlled LSP path as long as VLAN number is 
   distinguished. This means GMPLS control entity may coexist with 
   IEEE 802.1 control entities in control plane that bridges may provide 
   connection oriented service using LSP, as well as connectionless 
   service using IEEE spanning tree path. It is also noted that QoS 
   policy can be enforced in granularity of LSP when priority tag is 
   attached to GMPLS frames.

4.   GMPLS Bridge Model 
    
   Figure 2 below shows a bridge model of GMPLS implementation when 
   802.1D/Q bridge is assumed. However, this proposal doesn't restrict 
   the underlying hardware model that other types of data plane switch, 
   such as IEEE 802.1ah, may also be applied.  
    
   In this bridge model, GMPLS control entity can be colocated with 802.1 
   bridge control entities and bridge management entity. The underlying 
   data plane switch provides necessary service primitives for 
   configuring Filtering Database (FDB) and port state. 802.1 bridge 
   control entities and GMPLS control entity may share resources in data 
   plane, or GMPLS may disable 802.1 control and exclusively use the 
   resources.  
    
   When GMPLS exclusively controls bridge, all bridge ports must be open 
   in forwarding state except administratively disabled port. As a 
   result, IP routing protocol in control plane advertises all available 
   links, and LSP can be established through any optimum port. Care must 
   be taken that no unicast frame infiltrate into the network, because 
   it may cause infinite duplication and flooding of the unknown frame. 
   Only the group prefixed GMPLS frames must flow in the network. All 
   GMPLS implemented bridges must set default group filtering behavior, 
   thus any reception of unregistered multicast frame must be discarded. 
    
   When GMPLS coexists with 802.1 bridge control entities, a VLAN ID 
   must be allocated for GMPLS in order to separate GMPLS traffic from 
   spanning tree traffic. Forwarding state of the VLAN chosen for GMPLS 
   must be configured in all ports except administratively disabled port. 
   Default group filtering behavior of the VLAN tagged frames should 
   also be configured. Only the VLAN tagged multicast frames should be 
   admitted for GMPLS service. Other VLANs can be used according to IEEE 
   802.1 protocols. Both types of multicast/unicast frames are allowed 
   in such VLAN.

   5.1 IP Service in Bridged Core Network 
    
   Figure 3 below illustrates an IP service model where core nodes 
   consist of homogeneous 802.1D/Q bridges. It is assumed the edge 
   routers (R1 and R2) provide IP service to external users, and the 
   Ethernet interfaces facing backbone are capable of promiscuous 
   reception of multicast Ethernet frames. GMPLS control entities exist 
   in both edge routers and core bridges, and distribute label 
   information (i.e. multicast MAC addresses) between them. 
    
   The edge routers and core bridges share common pool of label space 
   (i.e. multicast address block reserved for GMPLS) in the 
   administrative domain. In other words, a multicast address assigned 
   for an LSP is used globally in the intra-domain that once it is 
   occupied by an edge node, no other nodes in the network may use the 
   number until the edge node releases the number. This requires global 
   coordination of label allocation. There can be several methods for 
   global control of label use, such as dividing the 16 million 
   multicast addresses and pre-allocating to each edge node, or running 
   a centralized address allocation server. Detail of label allocation 
   scheme is beyond the scope of this document.

   Figure 3. GMPLS Controlled Bridge Network 
    
    
   An example for establishing a point-to-point multicast path (i.e. 
   unicast LSP in view of control plane) is explained using the figure 3. 
   In the figure, an egress edge router R2 allocates a multicast address 
   d1 (i.e. downstream label) for a FEC (Forwarding Equivalence Class). 
   A multicast reception state of the address d1 must be configured in 
   the interface of R2. The mapping information of the multicast address 
   and the FEC is distributed using RSVP-TE. Intermediate core bridge S1 
   reserves resources necessary for the LSP and configures multicast 
   forwarding entry of the address d1, hence establishes a multicast 
   path of R1->R2 direction. The ingress edge router R1 also allocates a 
   multicast address s1 for backward LSP and configures a multicast 
   reception state in the Ethernet interface. The upstream label s1 also 
   need to be distributed to S1 and R2, as a result, bi-directional 
   multicast path is established between R1 and R2. Detail of the 
   signaling procedure is out of the scope of this document. 
    
   When the ingress edge router R1 receives a data packet belong to the 
   FEC, R1 encapsulates the packet in an Ethernet frame of which 
   destination address is d1, and source address is s1. R1 forwards the 
   composed multicast frame via the established LSP, and the frame is 
   delivered to R2. Since R2 configured the multicast address d1 in the 
   input interface, R2 receives the frame and strips off the Ethernet 
   header and forwards the packet to the output interface. No label 
   swapping operation is necessary in intermediate nodes in intra-domain 
   application. It also does not require using VLAN when the service 
   model of the network is IP only.

   5.2 Coexistence with Spanning Tree and Ethernet Service 
    
   In this multi-service model, a bridged core network may provide both 
   IP service using edge routers, as well as Ethernet connectivity 
   service as specified in IEEE 802.1D/Q, when a VLAN is used for 
   separating edge router group from Ethernet servicing edges.  
    
   The edge router group that share common bridged core network must 
   transmit/receive frames tagged with the VLAN chosen for GMPLS. 
   Intermediate nodes must configure forwarding state of the VLAN in all 
   ports, as a result, LSPs can be established via any shortest path 
   available in the network. Filtering state of the VLAN must be 
   configured on the ports servicing external Ethernet user that no 
   unicast frame or bogus frame may infiltrate into the VLAN group.  
    
   Except the VLAN ID allocated for GMPLS, rest of 4093 VLANs can be 
   used for providing Ethernet access service in the bridged core 
   network. Those VLANs can be configured manually or using IEEE 
   protocols. This document doesn't preclude use of GMPLS for automated 
   setup of VLAN. When GMPLS is used for configuring VLAN, this may 
   reduce operational burden. However, a serious limitation of this 
   method is the size of VLAN ID (12bits) that it allows at most 4093 
   number of VLANs to be established in an administrative domain. This 
   is far short scale compared to 16 million label space available when 
   using MAC address for label. 
    
   While doubling the VLAN size as seen in IEEE 802.1ad may enhance the 
   scalability, it still has limitation of service-VLAN that maximum 
   number of customers supported in a provider domain is 4094 when 
   customer use of their own VLAN is to be supported [IEEE8021AD].  
    
    
   5.3 MAC-in-MAC Tunnel Service 
    
   For the scalability reason discussed in section 4.2, this document 
   supports use of MAC-in-MAC encapsulation tunnel for Ethernet service. 
   Edge bridges of this capability encapsulate customer frames using 
   provider provisioned backbone MAC header. This is similar concept as 
   edge router encapsulating IP packet in GMPLS prefixed frame, 
   explained in section 4.1, except that the payload is now customer MAC 
   frame. Once a customer MAC frame is encapsulated by provider MAC 
   frame, the frame is forwarded using the provider MAC header while 
   progressing in the core network. The provider MAC header is stripped 
   off at egress edge bridge of the MAC-in-MAC tunnel. 
    
   Currently this concept of MAC-in-MAC tunnel service is being defined 
   in IEEE 802.1ah (Provider Backbone Bridge), although the document 
   doesn't specifically refer use of multicast address for backbone MAC 
   header. The MAC-in-MAC tunnel can be controlled by GMPLS when GMPLS

   is used for delivering edge information between 802.1ah bridges, such 
   as B-MAC information.  
    
   The proposed MAC-in-MAC tunnel shows some appropriate characteristics 
   in servicing Ethernet user. For example, compared to the scale 
   limitation of VLAN, this approach allows up to 16 million MAC-in-MAC 
   tunnels being established in an administrative domain, when a block 
   of 24bit multicast addresses is reserved for the tunnel address. In 
   fact, there is no limitation of the number of tunnels when any 
   private MAC address is allowed for the tunnel address. 
    
   The termination point of MAC-in-MAC tunnel service can be an internal 
   port of edge bridge, an external port, or even an abstract port. When 
   an external port servicing an Ethernet customer is the demarcation 
   point of MAC-in-MAC service, the customer is free to define their own 
   VLANs up to the limit of VLAN scale. Multiple MAC-in-MAC tunnels may 
   also be provided for each VLANs at a port.  
    
    
   5.4 Interoperation with GMPLS unaware bridges 
    
   While the IP service model presented in section 4.1 assumes 
   homogeneous deployment of GMPLS for convenience of description, this 
   proposal does not mandate GMPLS being deployed in all core nodes to 
   initiate operation. GMPLS unaware bridges may coexist in the network 
   and participate in delivering GMPLS frames. In this case, a VLAN for 
   GMPLS must be configured in both GMPLS implemented bridges and 
   unaware bridges.  
    
   Since GMPLS implemented bridges have ability to control multicast 
   frames and avoid looping, the GMPLS bridges set forwarding state of 
   the VLAN in all ports and take all ports in consideration of shortest 
   path computation. However the GMPLS unaware bridges may not have such 
   ability, hence, filtering state of the VLAN must be configured 
   carefully in those bridges that unexpected looping of multicast 
   frames is prevented. 
    
   There can be several methods to prevent looping of multicast frames 
   in legacy bridges. Figure 4 below shows an example of VLAN 
   configuration where GMPLS implemented bridges, G1 and G2, share 
   common LAN segment with GMPLS unaware bridges, B1 and B2. R1 and R2 
   describe edge routers supporting GMPLS implementation. The GMPLS 
   implemented bridges configured the VLAN in all ports and use all 
   ports for forwarding multicast frames.  
    
   When one of the GMPLS unaware bridges configured forwarding state of 
   the VLAN, other bridge that sharing the common LAN segment must 
   filter the VLAN in order to prevent looping between the bridges.

   Figure 4 illustrates that B2 set filtering state of the VLAN in one 
   of the ports, as a result, GMPLS frames pass only through B1.

   When B1 and B2 are capable of supporting GMRP (GARP Multicast Routing 
   Protocol) or IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol), GMPLS 
   implemented bridges may interact with the GMPLS unaware bridges using 
   the protocols and precisely control LSP path in those bridges. Detail 
   of the interoperation with GMPLS unaware bridges is out of the scope 
   in this document.

6. Inter-domain Extension and Future Work 
    
   In this version of document, the proposed LSE method only applies to 
   intra-domain case where allocation of multicast address is 
   administered by single organization. This allows up to 16 million 
   LSPs being established in a bridged core network which is enough in 
   most scale of single administrative domain. 
    
   When two bridged network of different administrative domains need to 
   be interconnected, this document recommends using upper layer 
   protocol relay, such as MPLS LSR or IP router. Layer-2 connectivity 
   of LSP is terminated at the border of domain. 
    
   Currently, work is in progress in IEEE 802.1ah to provide layer-2 
   connectivity in inter-domain scale. A solution being considered is 
   extension of MAC-in-MAC tunnel across multiple inter-domain networks. 
   Since LSE also supports MAC-in-MAC tunnel, it is expected that any 
   inter-domain solution devised in 802.1ah may equally be applied to 
   this proposal.
