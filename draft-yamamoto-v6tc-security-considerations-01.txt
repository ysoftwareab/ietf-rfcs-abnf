Internet-Draft      Softwire security considerations          March 2006


1.  Introduction

   The softwire working group is specifying the standardization of
   discovery, control and encapsulation methods for connecting IPv4
   networks across IPv6-only networks and IPv6 networks across IPv4-only
   networks.  Two deployment scenarios were identified: "Hubs and
   spokes" and "Mesh" [I-D.softwire-problem-statement].

   This document defines the security requirements based on the softwire
   problem statement, and specify the required security mechanism for
   softwire.

   Author Note: The softwire solution for both Hubs and Spokes and Mesh
   are to defined in framework documents which are currently work-in-
   progress.  This document is thus incomplete and will evolve as the
   framework documents progress.


2.  Terminology

   The terminology is based on the softwire problem statement document
   [I-D.softwire-problem-statement]

   Softwire Concentrator (SC) - The node terminating the softwire in the
   service provider network.

   Softwire Initiator (SI) - The node initiating the softwire within the
   customer network.

   Softwire Transport Header AF (STH AF) - the address family of the
   outermost IP header of a softwire.

   Softwire Payload Header AF (SPH AF) - the address family of the IP
   headers being carried within a softwire.  Note that additional
   "levels" of IP headers may be present if (for example) a tunnel is
   carried over a softwire - the key attribute of SPH AF is that it is
   directly encapsulated within the softwire and the softwire endpoint
   will base forwarding decisions on the SPH AF when a packet is exiting
   the softwire.


3.  Softwire Security Requirements

   Softwire can be used to connect IPv4 networks across public IPv6
   networks and IPv6 networks across public IPv4 networks.  The control
   and data packets used during the softwire session are vulnerable to
   attack.

   A complete threat analysis of softwire requires examination of the
   protocols used for the for the softwire setup, the encapsulation
   method used to transport the payload, and other protocols used for
   configuration (e.g., router advertisements, DHCP).

   Threat analysis done for other protocols L2TP using IPsec [RFC3193],
   PANA [RFC4016], NSIS [RFC4081], [I-D.rpsec-routing-threats] are
   applicable here as well and should be used as reference.

   Examples of attacks on softwire include:

   1.  An adversary may try to discover identities by snooping data
       packets.

   2.  An adversary may try to modify packets (both control and data).

   3.  An adversary may try to hijack the softwire tunnel.

   4.  An adversary can launch denial of service attacks by terminating
       softwire created tunnels.

   5.  An adversary may attempt to disrupt the softwire negotiation in
       order to weaken or remove confidentiality protection.

   6.  An adversary may impersonate the softwire concentrator to
       intercept traffic ("rogue" softwire concentrator).

   7.  to be completed...

   The following sections describe differences between the hub and
   spokes and the mesh solutions which are important to consider with
   respect to security considerations.

3.1.  Hub and Spokes

   o  Softwire is always initiated from the client side

   o  Initiator can be a host, appliance, sensor, etc. (not necessarily
      a human being)

   o  Must support roaming.  Initiator may connect from a visiting
      (untrusted) network

   o

3.2.  Mesh

   o  Mesh scenario consists of routers (AFBRs) advertising routes for
      relatively large network islands.  There is no softwire
      concentrator, as in the hub and spoke scenario.

   o  Used inside a provider network.  No "roaming".

   o  Authentication must be supported, but may be deactivated.  This
      authentication is done between AFBRs.  There is no user
      authentication, as in the hub and spoke scenario.

   The following softwire requirements are not covered in this document
   yet (with respect to security): service discovery, scaling, routing
   and multicast.


4.  Authentication requirements

   The requirements defined in the problem statement state that
   authentication MUST be supported, but mutual authentication and no
   authentication SHOULD be possible.

   The non-authenticated mode relies "out-of- band" authentication; for
   example, the IP source address.  Or in the case where we global
   unique IPv4 addresses are not used, an NAI of some sort may also be
   used.  This is the deployment case whereby ISPs will likely not use
   authentication for their own users, but instead rely on IP-address
   based filtering.

   In addition, the non-authenticated mode relies on security of
   provider network; otherwise, the softwire concentrator (Hubs and
   Spokes scenario) will be open to a variety of DoS attacks.  The non-
   authenticated mode must be intra-provider only deployment.


5.  IPSec

   Although the softwire framework documents are not yet completed,
   IPsec is already mentioned as must support in the problem statement.

   [I-D.bellovin-useipsec] gives guidelines on what authors should
   describe with respect to mandating IPsec.  The question list that
   follows is taken literally from that document.

   Author note: To be completed based on "Hubs and Spokes" and "Mesh"
   frameworks.  Point out differences (e.g., user authentication)

   1.  What selectors the initiator of the conversation (the client, in
       client-server architectures) should use?  What addresses, port
       numbers, etc., are to be used?

   2.  What IPsec protocol is to be used: AH or ESP?  What mode is to be
       employed: transport mode or tunnel mode?

   3.  What form of key management is appropriate?

   4.  What security policy database entry types should be used by the
       responder (i.e., the server) when deciding whether or not to
       accept the IPsec connection request?

   5.  What form of identification should be used?  Choices include IP
       address, DNS name, and X.500 distinguished name.

   6.  What form of authentication should be used?  Choices include pre-
       shared secrets, certificates, and (for IKEv2) an EAP exchange
       [RFC2284].

   7.  Which of the many variants of IKE must be supported?  Main mode?
       Aggressive mode?

   8.  Is suitable IPsec support available in likely configurations of
       the products that would have to employ IPsec?
