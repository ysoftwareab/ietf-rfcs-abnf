1.  Introduction

   Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS), also known as Transparent LAN
   Service and Virtual Private Switched Network service, is a Layer 2
   Service that emulates LAN service across a Wide Area Network (WAN)
   [RFC4664].  The primary motivation behind Virtual Private LAN
   Services (VPLS) is to provide connectivity between geographically
   dispersed customer sites across the service provider network, as if
   they were connected using a LAN.

   In the trend of network convergence, service providers may need to
   deploy both VPLS and other services, i.e.  L3VPN [RFC4364] in the
   same network, and they may need to deploy VPLS in larger scale
   networks.  In response to such requirements, a scalable and
   architecture converged VPLS mechanism is needed.  Currently there are
   two kinds of signaling approaches for VPLS: BGP based [RFC4761] and
   LDP based [RFC4762], both of them have some disadvantages in meeting
   the requirements.

   This document describes a new BGP based signaling mechanism for
   providing Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) and relevant BGP
   encodings and procedures.  This new solution combines the advantage
   of both the existing BGP based and LDP based VPLS mechanisms.


2.  Overview of Existing VPLS signaling

   Though there are two existing mechanisms to deploy VPLS, both of them
   have some disadvantages in meeting the requirement of deploying VPLS
   in large scale and multiservice networks.

2.1.  Features of Existing BGP based VPLS

   [RFC4761] describes the BGP based auto-discovery and signaling
   mechanism for VPLS.  The mechanism combines VPLS membership auto-
   discovery and signaling into a single BGP Update advertisement.  Each
   PE advertises Update message that contains the same label blocks to
   all the other PEs, and each receiving PE infers the label intended by
   adding its (unique) VE ID to the label base.  Route Target carried in
   the Update message is used to identify VPLS instance.

   The advantage of existing BGP VPLS is both the membership auto-
   discovery and signaling use the same protocol, which makes the VPLS
   control plane simpler and converged with services like L3VPN.
   Besides, the use of Route Reflection (RR) could avoid the full mesh
   of VPLS signaling sessions.

   However, there are some issues of this approach which may affect the

   deployment of this mechanism in larger networks :

   a.  The use of label block is based on idea of "allocate in advance"
   and "over-provisioning", thus the utilization of label resources is
   not quite efficient compared with on-demand label allocation in LDP
   VPLS [RFC4762].

   b.  Each PE within a given VPLS needs be assigned a unique VE ID,
   arranging this VE ID space introduces extra management burden for
   operators, especially in multi-AS scenarios.  Besides, the value of
   local VE ID would impact label block allocation of remote PEs, which
   makes the management more complicated and also may impact efficiency
   of label resource utilization.

2.2.  Features of Existing LDP based VPLS

   [RFC4762] describes the control plane functions of signaling
   pseudowire labels using Label Distribution Protocol (LDP).

   In LDP signaling, the PW labels are allocated "on-demand" for remote
   PEs in each VPLS instance, thus the utilization of label resource is
   quite efficient.

   LDP itself does not provide mechanism for membership auto-discovery.
   Thus by default the identities of all the other pseudowire endpoints
   need to be manually configured on local PE for each VPLS instance,
   which is configuration intensive and error-prone since the LDP
   sessions are normally fully meshed.

   Although BGP-based auto-discovery in [RFC6074] can be jointly used
   with LDP signaling, it is still required to set up fully meshed
   targeted LDP sessions among PEs participating in the given VPLS, thus
   overhead of maintaining full-mesh LDP sessions may become an issue in
   large scale networks.  Besides, membership discovery and signaling
   procedures are provided by BGP and LDP respectively, which means
   operators need to deploy BGP and targeted LDP simultaneously for
   providing VPLS services in their networks.  This would increase the
   complexity in provisioning and trouble shooting.

   For service providers who have already deployed L3VPN service in
   their networks and want to deploy VPLS in the same network, they may
   prefer to deploy VPLS using the similar technology as L3VPN to
   simplify network operation and maintenance.  LDP based VPLS can not
   meet this requirement.

3.  BGP Encodings

   This section describes BGP extensions for the proposed VPLS signaling
   mechanism.

3.1.  VPLS PW NLRI

   A new BGP NLRI called "VPLS PW NLRI" is defined for VPLS PW
   signaling.  AFI of L2VPN (25) is used, and a new SAFI is to be
   assigned.  Format of the new NLRI is as below.

                   +-----------------------------------+
                   |      RD   (8 octets)              |
                   +-----------------------------------+
                   |   VPLS ID Type (1 octet)          |
                   +-----------------------------------+
                   |     VPLS ID  (Variable)           |
                   +-----------------------------------+
                   |Local PE Address Length (1 octet)  |
                   +-----------------------------------+
                   |Local PE Address (Variable)        |
                   +-----------------------------------+
                   |Remote PE Address Length (1 octet) |
                   +-----------------------------------+
                   |Remote PE Address (Variable)       |
                   +-----------------------------------+

                   Figure 1: VPLS PW NLRI
   The RD field is encoded as described in [RFC4364].

   The VPLS ID Type field and VPLS ID field are used to uniquely
   identify a specific VPLS instance.

   This document defines three VPLS ID Types:

   + 0 - Reserved;

   + 1 - Encoded as a 32-bit identifier;

   + 2 - Encoded as an 8-byte BGP Extended Community.

   The Local PE Address field and Remote PE Address field contains a
   local PE's IP address and remote PE's IP Address respectively.  They
   are used to identify the two PEs between which a PW needs to be set
   up.  Note that the PE address here is used solely to provide a unique
   identifier.  If the PE Address field carries an IPv4 address, the
   value of the PE Address Length field is 32.  If the PE Address field
   carries an IPv6 address, then the value of the PE Address Length

   field is 128.

3.2.  New BGP Attributes for VPLS

3.2.1.  Label Attribute

   Label Attribute is an optional transitive BGP attribute with the
   length of 4 octets.  It contains an MPLS label encoded as 3 octets,
   where the high-order 20 bits contain the label value.  Absence of
   MPLS Label is indicated by setting the MPLS Label field to zero.  The
   Reserved field is reserved for future use.  It MUST be set to zero on
   transmission and MUST be ignored on receipt.

                   +-----------------------------------+
                   |      Reserved (1 octet)           |
                   +-----------------------------------+
                   |      MPLS Label (3 octets)        |
                   +-----------------------------------+

                   Figure 2: Label Attribute

   This MPLS label is used as pseudowire demultiplexor for the PW
   between the two PEs identified in the VPLS PW NLRI.  In this way, the
   PW label is allocated explicitly for each PW, thus the label resource
   would be utilized efficiently.

3.2.2.  Status Attribute

   Status Attribute defined in this document can be used by a PE device
   to indicate pseudowire status to its remote PEs.  This attribute
   contains more information than the alternative simple
   MP_UNREACH_NLRI.

   It is an optional transitive BGP attribute.  The format of this
   attribute is defined as follows:

                   +-----------------------------------+
                   |      Reserved (1 octet)           |
                   +-----------------------------------+
                   |     Status Code (4 octets)        |
                   +-----------------------------------+

                   Figure 3: Status Attribute

   The Reserved field is reserved for future use.  It MUST be set to
   zero on transmission and MUST be ignored on receipt.

   The Status Code field is a 4-octet bit field as specified in the PW

   IANA Allocations document [RFC4446].  Each bit in the status code
   field can be set individually to indicate more than a single failure
   at once.  Each fault can be cleared by sending an Update message for
   the particular PW in which the respective bit is cleared.

   Usage of Status Attribute is described in Section 4.2.2.

3.2.3.  Interface Parameter Attribute

   Interface Parameter Attribute defined in this document contains a set
   of interface-specific parameters.  It is an optional transitive BGP
   attribute.  The format of this attribute is defined as follows:

                  +-----------------------------------+
                  |      Reserved (1 octet)           |
                  +-----------------------------------+
                  |    Sub-TLV Type (1 octet)         |
                  +-----------------------------------+
                  |    Sub-TLV Length (1 octet)       |
                  +-----------------------------------+
                  |    Sub-TLV Value (Variable)       |
                  +-----------------------------------+
                  |              ...                  |
                  +-----------------------------------+
                  |    Sub-TLV Type (1 octet)         |
                  +-----------------------------------+
                  |    Sub-TLV Length (1 octet)       |
                  +-----------------------------------+
                  |    Sub-TLV Value (Variable)       |
                  +-----------------------------------+

                  Figure 4: Interface Parameter Attribute

   The Reserved field is reserved for future use.  It MUST be set to
   zero on transmission and MUST be ignored on receipt.

   Each <Type, Length, Value> tuple contains particular interface-
   specific parameters.

   The allocation and usage of particular interface-specific parameter
   can refer to [RFC4446].  This document does not define any new
   interface-specific parameters.  The definition of other interface-
   specific parameters is left for further study.

3.2.4.  Grouping Attribute

   Grouping Attribute defined in this document is an optional transitive
   BGP attribute.  The format of this attribute is defined as follows:

                   +-----------------------------------+
                   |      Reserved (1 octet)           |
                   +-----------------------------------+
                   |  PW Grouping ID  (4 octets)       |
                   +-----------------------------------+

                   Figure 5: Grouping Attribute

   The Reserved field is reserved for future use.  It MUST be set to
   zero on transmission and MUST be ignored on receipt.

   The PW Grouping ID is an arbitrary 32-bit value that represents an
   arbitrary group of PWs.  Detailed specification of use of the
   Grouping Attribute is outside the scope of this document.

3.2.5.  MAC List Attribute

   MAC List Attribute is an optional transitive BGP attribute.  The
   format of this attribute is defined as follows:

                   +-----------------------------------+
                   |      Reserved (1 octet)           |
                   +-----------------------------------+
                   |    MAC address #1  (6 octets)     |
                   +-----------------------------------+
                   |    MAC address #2  (6 octets)     |
                   +-----------------------------------+
                   ~            ...                    ~
                   +-----------------------------------+
                   |    MAC address #n  (6 octets)     |
                   +-----------------------------------+

                   Figure 6: MAC List Attribute

   The Reserved field is reserved for future use.  It MUST be set to
   zero on transmission and MUST be ignored on receipt.

   The MAC Addresses listed in this attribute are the MAC addresses
   being removed.


4.  Proposed BGP VPLS Solution

   This section describes a solution which uses BGP to set up VPLS
   services.  Unlike the mechanism in [RFC4761], the procedures of
   "membership auto-discovery" and "signaling" are divided into two
   separate steps.

Internet-Draft           BGP Signaling for VPLS                July 2011


4.1.  Auto-Discovery

   The auto-discovery procedures defined in Section 3.2.2 of [RFC6074]
   is used for VPLS membership auto-discovery.  Thus the BGP
   advertisement for a particular VSI at a given PE will contain:

   o an NLRI of AFI = L2VPN, SAFI = VPLS, encoded as RD:PE_addr

   o a BGP next hop equal to the loopback address of the PE

   o an Extended Community Attribute containing the VPLS ID

   o an Extended Community Attribute containing one or more RTs.

   For more details about BGP VPLS auto-discovery please refer to
   [RFC6074].

4.2.  Signaling

   Once discovery is finished, each pair of PEs in a VPLS must be able
   to establish pseudowires to each other, this process is known as
   signaling.  Signaling is also used to exchange certain
   characteristics of the pseudowires that a PE sets up to remote PEs.

   This document defines a new BGP NLRI, called VPLS PW NLRI, for
   signaling and maintenance of pseudowires that constitute a VPLS
   instance.  This document also specifies a set of new BGP attributes
   for VPLS signaling and maintenance, e.g.  Label attribute, Status
   attribute, Interface Parameter attribute, Grouping attribute, and MAC
   List attribute.

4.2.1.  PW Set Up and Tear Down Signaling

   After the auto-discovery phase finished, PE X knows other PEs of the
   same VPLS by matching the RTs carried in the received auto-discovery
   routes with the import RTs configured for local VSIs, and identifying
   the VPLS-ID carried in the auto-discovery route.

   Once PE X discovers that a remote PE (Y) is in the same VPLS, it
   SHOULD advertise a BGP update message with VPLS PW NLRI to set up the
   PW between PE X and PE Y. The BGP Update message is constructed as
   follows:

   - The RD in this NLRI is set to the RD of the given VPLS's VSI. - The
   VPLS ID Type field may be set to a particular value according to the
   local configuration.  The VPLS ID field is encoded according to the
   local configuration.  Moreover, value of VPLS ID field carried in the
   BGP VPLS Signaling route MUST be the same as those carried in the

Internet-Draft           BGP Signaling for VPLS                July 2011


   corresponding BGP VPLS auto-discovery route.

   - The Local PE Address field MUST be set with the same IP address as
   the one carried in PE Address field of the BGP VPLS Auto-Discovery
   route advertised before.  The Remote PE Address MUST be set with IP
   Address as the one carried in the PE Address field of the received
   BGP VPLS auto-discovery route.

   The BGP Update message SHOULD also carries following attributes:

   - The same set of Route Target Extended Communities as those carried
   in the corresponding BGP VPLS auto-discovery route.

   - The BGP Update message MUST carry a Label Attribute.  The label
   carried in Label Attribute will be used as the pseudowire
   demultiplexor.

   - The BGP Update message MUST carry a Layer 2 Info Extended Community
   [RFC4761].  The value of each field is determined by local
   configuration.

   - The BGP Update message MAY carry an Interface Parameter Attribute.
   The value of each field is specified by local configuration.

   Likewise, the remote PE Y SHOULD also initiate the signaling for the
   PW between PE X and PE Y.

   If one PE is configured no longer a member of specific VPLS, it
   SHOULD withdraw the auto-discovery NLRI for the VPLS.  Moreover, it
   SHOULD also withdraw the VPLS PW NLRIs it has advertised for this
   VPLS.  On receipt of the withdrawals, the remote PEs SHOULD tear down
   the PWs with this PE by sending withdrawals of corresponding NLRIs
   using MP_UNREACH_NLRI attribute.

4.2.2.  PW Status Signaling

   The Status Attribute is used to indicate status information to remote
   PEs.  The definition and usage of particular Status Code can refer to
   [RFC4446].  This document does not define any new Status Code.
   Definition of new Status Codes is left for further study.

   When a PE advertises BGP VPLS Signaling routes to its peers in
   response to the received BGP VPLS Auto-Discovery route, a PW Status
   Attribute MUST be carried in the BGP Update message.  When status of
   particular PW changes, a new BGP Update message corresponding to this
   PW SHOULD be sent to inform the remote PE of this change.

4.2.3.  MAC Address Withdrawal

   It MAY be desirable to remove or unlearn MAC addresses that have been
   dynamically learned for faster convergence.  This is accomplished by
   sending a BGP Update message with MAC List Attribute which containing
   the list of MAC addresses to be removed.

   The VPLS ID, Local PE Address and Remote PE Address fields carried in
   VPLS PW NLRI can be used to identify the VPLS instance and the
   associated pseudowire.

   The processing of received in a BGP Update message with a MAC List
   Attribute is:

   For each MAC address listed in the Attribute:

   - Remove the association between the MAC address and the AC or PW.

   For a MAC List Attribute with empty list:

   - Remove all the MAC addresses associated with the VPLS instance
   except the MAC addresses learned over the PW identified by the NLRI
   field of the message.

   When the MAC Address Withdrawal attribute contains a large number of
   MAC addresses, it may be preferable to send a message with an empty
   list.

4.3.  Operations for Better Scalability

   As discussed in [RFC4761], there are at least three aspects of
   scaling the VPLS control plane when using BGP:

   1. alleviating the full mesh connectivity requirement among VPLS BGP
   speakers;

   2. limiting BGP VPLS message passing to just the interested speakers
   rather than all BGP speakers; and

   3. simplifying the addition and deletion of BGP speakers, whether for
   VPLS or other applications.

   The use of BGP route reflectors [RFC4456] can solve problems 1 and 3
   above well.  With regard to problem 2, [RFC4761] addresses this
   question by the use of RT-Constrain [RFC4684].  Besides this, the use
   of Outbound Route Filtering (ORF) ([RFC5291]) can also help in
   alleviating the control plane overhead.  The following section
   describes the mechanism used in this document to solve problem 2.

4.3.1.  Distribution of VPLS Signaling Message

   Using the signaling mechanism in this document, the BGP signaling
   message contains information of only one PW connectivity, thus this
   information only need be propagated to the remote end point of this
   PW.  This section describes the mechanism for controlling
   distribution of VPLS signaling messages.

   After the auto-discovery phase specified in section 4.1, VPLS remote
   endpoint information has been propagated throughout the network.
   Each BGP (VPLS) speaker, including PEs, RRs and ASBRs, can use the
   received PW endpoint information to form a "VPLS Route Distribution
   Information Base".  Entries in the "VPLS Route Information Base" may
   have the format as below:

   <VPLS ID, Advertising PE, Receiving Neighbors>

   The VPLS ID and Advertising PE field identify a VPLS PW endpoint of
   the corresponding auto-discovery route.  The Receiving Neighbor
   identifies the BGP neighbor from which this VPLS auto-discovery route
   is received.

   Consequently, specific VPLS Signaling routes MAY only be sent to the
   corresponding advertising Neighbor.  This is achieved by identifying
   the Remote PE Address in the VPLS PW NLRI of the message, and only
   advertises this message to the Receiving Neighbors of the
   corresponding entry in the "VPLS Route Distribution Information
   Base".

   Using this advertisement rule, the BGP VPLS signaling routes will
   only be sent to relevant speakers, rather than be flooded to all BGP
   speakers in the network.


5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to make the following allocations from registries
   under its control.

   This document defines a new NLRI, VPLS PW NLRI for BGP VPLS
   signaling.  A new SAFI value needs be assigned.

   SAFI Name             Value
   ---------------------------
   VPLS PW NLRI           TBA

   This document specifies a series of new BGP attributes, new BGP
   Attribute Types need be assigned for these BGP attributes:
