                        Babel Information Model
                 draft-ietf-babel-information-model-02

Abstract

   This Babel Information Model can be used to create data models under
   various data modeling regimes (e.g., YANG).  It allows a Babel
   implementation (via a management protocol such as netconf) to report
   on its current state and may allow some limited configuration of
   protocol constants.

1.  Introduction

   Babel is a loop-avoiding distance-vector routing protocol defined in
   draft-ietf-babel-rfc6126bis [rfc6126bis]. draft-babel-7298bis
   [BABEL-HMAC] defines a security mechanism that allows Babel messages
   to be cryptographically authenticated, and draft-babel-dtls
   [BABEL-DTLS] defines a security mechanism that allows Babel messages
   to encrypted.  This document describes an information model for Babel
   (including implementations using one of these security mechanisms)
   that can be used to created management protocol data models (such as
   a netconf [RFC6241] YANG data model).

   Due to the simplicity of the Babel protocol and the fact that it is
   designed to be used in non-professionally administered environments
   (such as home networks), most of the information model is focused on
   reporting status of the Babel protocol, and very little of that is
   considered mandatory to implement (conditional on a management
   protocol with Babel support being implemented).  Some parameters may
   be configurable; however, it is up to the Babel implementation
   whether to allow any of these to be configured within its
   implementation.  Where the implementation does not allow

   configuration of these parameters, it may still choose to expose them
   as read-only.

   The Information Model is presented using a hierarchical structure.
   This does not preclude a data model based on this Information Model
   from using a referential or other structure.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.  Notation

   This document uses a programming language-like notation to define the
   properties of the objects of the information model.  An optional
   property is enclosed by square brackets, [ ], and a list property is
   indicated by two numbers in angle brackets, <m..n>, where m indicates
   the minimal number of values, and n is the maximum.  The symbol * for
   n means no upper bound.

   The object definitions use base types that are defined as follows:

   base64      An opaque array of bytes.

   boolean     A type representing a boolean value.

   counter     A non-negative integer that monotonically increases.
               Counters may have discontinuities and they are not
               expected to persist across restarts.

   credentials An opaque type representing credentials needed by a
               cryptographic mechanism to secure communication.  Data
               models must expand this opaque type as needed and
               required by the security protocols utilized.

   datetime    A type representing a date and time using the Gregorian
               calendar.  The datetime format MUST conform to RFC 3339
               [RFC3339].

   int         A type representing signed or unsigned integer numbers.
               This information model does not define a precision nor
               does it make a distinction between signed and unsigned
               number ranges.  This type is also used to represent
               enumerations.

Internet-Draft           Babel Information Model              April 2018


   ip-address  A type representing an IP address.  This type supports
               both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

   string      A type representing a human-readable string consisting of
               a (possibly restricted) subset of Unicode and ISO/IEC
               10646 [ISO.10646] characters.

   uri         A type representing a Uniform Resource Identifier as
               defined in STD 66 [RFC3986].

2.  Overview

   The Information Model is hierarchically structured as follows:

   information object
      includes implementation version, router id, this node seqno,
        enable flag parameters
      constants object (exactly one per information object)
         includes UDP port and optional multicast and unicast groups
           parameters
      interfaces object
         includes interface reference, Hello seqno and intervals,
           update interval, link type, external cost parameters
         neighbors object
            includes neighbor IP address, Hello history, cost
              parameters
         security object (per interface)
            includes supported and enabled security mechanisms, self
              credentials (credential object), trusted credentials
              (credential object)
      security object (common to all interfaces)
         includes supported and enabled security mechanisms, self
           credentials (credential object), trusted credentials
           (credential object)
      routes object
         includes route prefix, source router, reference to
           advertising neighbor, metric, sequence number, whether
           route is feasible, whether route is selected

   Following is a list of the data elements that an implementation can
   choose to allow to be configurable:

   o  enable/disable babel

   o  Constant: UDP port

   o  Constant: IPv6 multicast group

   o  Constant: IPv4 multicast group

   o  Interface: Link type

   o  Interface: External cost (must be configurable if implemented, but
      implementation is optional)

   o  Interface: enable/disable babel on this interface

   o  Interface: enable/disable message log

   o  Security: self credentials

   o  Security: trusted credentials

   o  Security: enable/disable security log

   Note that this overview is intended simply to be informative and is
   not normative.  If there is any discrepancy between this overview and
   the detailed information model definitions in subsequent sections,
   the error is in this overview.

      babel-neighbor-ihu-interval: current IHU interval for this
      neighbor

      babel-rxcost: reception cost calculated for this neighbor; this
      value is usually derived from the Hello history, which may be
      combined with other data, such as statistics maintained by the
      link layer; the rxcost is sent to a neighbour in each IHU

      babel-cost: link cost is computed from the values maintained in
      the neighbour table: the statistics kept in the neighbour table
      about the reception of Hellos, and the txcost computed from
      received IHU packets

      received message (including Ethernet frame and IP headers); an
      implementation must restrict the size of this log, but how and
      what size is implementation-specific

3.6.  Definition of babel-routes-obj

        object {
             ip-address           babel-route-prefix;
             int                  babel-route-prefix-length;
             base64               babel-route-router-id;
            [int                  babel-route-metric;]
            [int                  babel-route-announced-metric;]
             int                  babel-route-seqno;
             ip-address           babel-route-next-hop;
             boolean              babel-route-feasible;
             boolean              babel-route-selected;
         }babel-routes-obj;

      babel-route-prefix: Prefix (expressed in IP address format) for
      which this route is advertised

      babel-route-prefix-length: Length of the prefix for which this
      route is advertised

      babel-route-router-id: router-id of the source router for which
      this route is advertised

      babel-route-metric: the metric with which this route was
      advertised by the neighbor, or maximum value (infinity) to
      indicate a recently retracted route; this metric will be 0 (zero)
      if the route was not received from a neighbor but was generated
      through other means; either babel-route-announced-metric or babel-
      route-metric MUST be provided

      babel-route-announced-metric: a calculated metric for this route;
      how the metric is calculated is implementation-specific; either

      babel-route-announced-metric or babel-route-metric MUST be
      provided

      babel-route-seqno: the sequence number with which this route was
      advertised

      babel-route-next-hop: the next-hop address of this route; this
      will be empty if this route has no next-hop address

      babel-route-feasible: a boolean flag indicating whether this route
      is known to work; a route that is not feasible will never be
      selected

      babel-route-selected: a boolean flag indicating whether this route
      is selected, i.e., whether it is currently being used for
      forwarding and is being advertised

4.  Common Objects

4.1.  Definition of babel-credential-obj

        object {
             credentials           babel-cred;
       }babel-credential-obj;

      babel-cred: a credential, such as an X.509 certificate, a public
      key, etc. used for signing and/or encrypting babel messages

4.2.  Definition of babel-log-obj

        object {
             datetime           babel-log-time;
             string             babel-log-entry;
       }babel-log-obj;

      babel-log-time: the date and time (according to the device
      internal clock setting, which may be a time relative to boot time,
      acquired from NTP, configured by the user, etc.) when this log
      entry was created

      babel-log-entry: the logged message, as a string of utf-8 encoded
      hex characters

5.  Extending the Information Model

   Implementations MAY extend this information model with other
   parameters or objects.  For example, an implementation MAY choose to
   expose babel route filtering rules by adding a route filtering object

Internet-Draft           Babel Information Model              April 2018


   with parameters appropriate to how route filtering is done in that
   implementation.  The precises means used to extend the information
   model would be specific to the data model the implementation uses to
   expose this information.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document defines a set of information model objects and
   parameters that may be exposed to be visible from other devices, and
   some of which may be configured.  Any mechanism or protocol that is
   used to transmit this information or allow for its configuration is
   also responsible for ensuring this is done so in a secure manner.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no IANA requests.

8.  Acknowledgements

   Juliusz Chroboczek's review has been very helpful in refining this
   information model.

   The language in the Notation section was mostly taken from RFC 8193
   [RFC8193].

Appendix A.  Open Issues

   This draft must be reviewed against draft-ietf-babel-rfc6126bis.  [I
   feel like this has been adequately done, but I could be wrong.]

   Following are some issues where a conscious decision may be useful:

   1.   babel-interfaces-obj: Juliusz:"This needs further discussion, I
        fear some of these are implementation details."  [In the absence
        of discussion, the current model stands.  Note that all but
        link-type and the neighbors sub-object are optional; if an
        implementation does not have any of the optional elements then
        it simply doesn't have them and that's fine.]

   2.   Would it be useful to define some parameters for reporting
        statistics or logs? [2 logs are now included.  If others are
        needed they need to be proposed.]

   3.   Would it be useful to define some parameters specifically for
        security anomalies?  [The 2 logs should be useful in identifying
        security anomalies.  If more is needed, someone needs to
        propose.]

   4.   I created a basic security model.  It's useful for single (or
        no) active security mechanism (e.g., just HMAC, just DTLS, or
        neither); but not multiple active (both HMAC and DTLS -- which
        is not the same as HMAC of DTLS and would just mean that HMAC
        would be used on all unencrypted messages -- but right now the
        model doesn't allow for configuring HMAC of unencrypted messages
        for routers without DTLS, while DTLS is used if possible).  OK?

   5.   Do we need a registry for the supported security mechanisms?
        [Given the current limited set, and unlikelihood of massive
        expansion, I don't think so.  But we can if someone wants it.]

   6.   babel-external-cost may need more work. [if no comment, it will
        be left as is]

   7.   babel-hello-[mu]cast-history: the Hello history is formated as
        16 bits, per A.1 of 6126bis.  Is that a too implementation
        specific?  [We also now have an optional-to-implement log of
        received messages, and I made these optional.  So maybe this is
        ok?]

   8.   rxcost, txcost, cost: is it ok to model as integers, since
        6126bis 2.1 says costs and metrics need not be integers.  [I
        have them as integers unless someone insists on something else.]

   9.   Should babel link types have an IANA registry?  [Right now, none
        is defined.]

   10.  For the security log, should it also log whether the credentials
        were considered ok?  [Right now it doesn't and I think that's ok
        because if you log Hellos it was ok and if you don't it wasn't.]

   Closed Issues:

      Closed by defining base64 type and using it for all router IDs:
      "babel-self-router-id: Should this be an opaque 64-bit value
      instead of int?"

Internet-Draft           Babel Information Model              April 2018


      v00 2017-07-03 Addressed points noted with "oops" in
      https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/98/slides/slides-98-babel-babel-
      information-model-00.pdf

      v01 2018-01-02 Removed item from issue list that was agreed (in
      Prague) not to be an issue.  Added description of data types under
      Notation section, and used these in all data types.  Added babel-
      security and babel-trust.

      v02 2018-mm-dd



         - changed babel-version description to babel-implementation-
         version

         - replace optional babel-interface-seqno with optional babel-
         mcast-hello-seqno and babel-ucast-hello-seqno

         - replace optional babel-interface-hello-interval with optional
         babel-mcast-hello-interval and babel-ucast-hello-interval

         - remove babel-request-trigger-ack

         - remove "babel-router-id: router-id of the neighbor"; note
         that parameter had previously been removed but description had
         accidentally not been removed

         - added an optional "babel-cost" field to babel-neighbors
         object, since the spec does not define how exactly the cost is
         computed from rxcost/txcost

         - deleted babel-source-garbage-collection-time

         - change babel-lossy-link to babel-link-type and make this an
         enumeration; added at top level babel-supported-link-types so
         which are supported by this implementation can be reported

         - changes to babel-security-obj to allow self credentials to be
         one or more instances of a credential object; allowed trusted
         credentials to include CA credentials; made some parameter name
         changes

         - updated references and Introduction

         - added Overview section

         - deleted babel-sources-obj

         - added feasible Boolean to routes

         - added section to briefly describe extending the information
         model.

         - deleted babel-route-neighbor

         - tried to make definition of babel-interface-reference clearer
