1.  Introduction

   This document updates [RFC4271] by revising control mechanism which
   limit the negative impact of route leaks [RFC7908] and/or resource
   exhaustion in Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) implementations.  While
   [RFC4271] described methods to tear down BGP sessions or discard
   UPDATES after certain thresholds are exceeded, some nuances in this
   specification were missing resulting in inconsistencies between BGP
   implementations.  In addition to clarifying "inbound maximum prefix
   limits", this document also introduces a specification for "outbound
   maximum prefix limits".

2.  Changes to RFC4271 Section 6

   This section updates [RFC4271] to specify what events can result in
   AutomaticStop (Event 8) in the BGP FSM.

   The following paragraph replaces the second paragraph of Section 6.7
   (Cease), which starts with "A BGP speaker MAY support" and ends with
   "The speaker MAY also log this locally.":

Internet-Draft      Revised BGP Maximum Prefix Limits     September 2019


      A BGP speaker MAY support the ability to impose a locally-
      configured, upper bound on the number of address prefixes the
      speaker is willing to accept from a neighbor (inbound maximum
      prefix limit) or send to a neighbor (outbound prefix limit).  The
      limit on the prefixes accepted from a neighbor can be applied
      before policy processing (Pre-Policy) or after policy processing
      (Post-Policy).  Outbound prefix limits MUST be measured after
      policy since the Policy (even a policy of "send all") is run
      before determining what can be sent.  When the upper bound is
      reached, the speaker, under control of local configuration,
      either:

      A.  Discards new address prefixes to or from the neighbor (while
          maintaining the BGP connection with the neighbor)

      B.  Terminates the BGP connection with the neighbor

      If the BGP peer uses option (b) where the limit causes a CEASE
      Notification, then the CEASE error codes should use:

   +---------+---------------------------------------------------------+
   | Subcode | Symbolic Name                                           |
   +---------+---------------------------------------------------------+
   | 1       | Maximum Number of Prefixes Reached                      |
   | TBD     | Threshold exceeded: Self-Destructing, Maximum Number of |
   |         | Prefixes Send                                           |
   +---------+---------------------------------------------------------+

      The speaker MAY also log this locally.

3.  Changes to RFC4271 Section 8

   This section updates Section 8 [RFC4271], the paragraph that starts
   with "One reason for an AutomaticStop event is" and ends with "The
   local system automatically disconnects the peer." is replaced with:

      Possible reasons for an AutomaticStop event are: A BGP speaker
      receives an UPDATE messages with a number of prefixes for a given
      peer such that the total prefixes received exceeds the maximum
      number of prefixes configured (either "Pre-Policy" or "Post-
      Policy"), or announces more prefixes than through local
      configuration allowed to.  The local system automatically
      disconnects the peer.

4.  BGP Yang Model Considerations - PERHAPS REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION

   In [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-model] in container 'prefix-limit', a leaf named
   "max-prefixes" exists.  The authors recommend the BGP Yang Model to
   be revised to contain the following leaves:

      max-prefixes-inbound-pre-policy

      max-prefixes-inbound-post-policy

      max-prefixes-outbound

   In addition to the above, the authors suggest that the BGP Yang Model
   is extended in such a way that per peer per AFI/SAFI pair an operator
   can specify whether to tear down the session or discard sending or
   receiving updates.

5.  Changes to RFC4271 Section 9

   This section updates [RFC4271] by adding a subsection after
   Section 9.4 (Originating BGP routes) to specify various events that
   can lead up to AutomaticStop (Event 8) in the BGP FSM.

      9.5 Maximum Prefix Limits

      9.5.1 Pre-Policy Inbound Maximum Prefix Limits



         The Adj-RIBs-In stores routing information learned from inbound
         UPDATE messages that were received from another BGP speaker
         Section 3.2 [RFC4271].  The pre-policy limit uses the number of
         NLRIs per Address Family Identifier (AFI) per Subsequent
         Address Family Identifier (SAFI) as input into its threshold
         comparisons.  For example, when an operator configures the pre-
         policy limit for IPv4 Unicast to be 50 on a given EBGP session,
         and the other BGP speaker announces its 51st IPv4 Unicast NLRI,
         the session MUST be terminated.

         Pre-policy limits are particularly useful to help dampen the
         effects of full table route leaks and memory exhaustion when
         the implementation stores rejected routes.

      9.5.2 Post-Policy Inbound Maximum Prefix Limits

Internet-Draft      Revised BGP Maximum Prefix Limits     September 2019


         RFC4271 describes a Policy Information Base (PIB) that contains
         local policies that can be applied to the information in the
         Routing Information Base (RIB).  The post-policy limit uses the
         number of NLRIs per Address Family Identifier (AFI) per
         Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI), after application
         of the Import Policy as input into its threshold comparisons.
         For example, when an operator configures the post-policy limit
         for IPv4 Unicast to be 50 on a given EBGP session, and the
         other BGP speaker announces a hundred IPv4 Unicast routes of
         which none are accepted as a result of the local import policy
         (and thus not considered for the Loc-RIB by the local BGP
         speaker), the session is not terminated.

         Post-policy limits are useful to help prevent FIB exhaustion
         and prevent accidental BGP session teardown due to prefixes not
         accepted by policy anyway.

      9.5.3 Outbound Maximum Prefix Limits



         An operator MAY configure a BGP speaker to terminate its BGP
         session with a neighbor when the number of address prefixes to
         be advertised to that neighbor exceeds a locally configured
         post-policy upper limit.  The BGP speaker then MUST send the
         neighbor a NOTIFICATION message with the Error Code Cease and
         the Error Subcode "Threshold reached: Maximum Number of
         Prefixes Send".  Implementations MAY support additional
         actions.  The Hard Cease action is defined in [RFC8538].

         Reporting when thresholds have been exceeded is an
         implementation specific consideration, but SHOULD include
         methods such as Syslog [RFC5424].  By definition, Outbound
         Maximum Prefix Limits are Post-Policy.

         The Adj-RIBs-Out stores information selected by the local BGP
         speaker for advertisement to its neighbors.  The routing
         information stored in the Adj-RIBs-Out will be carried in the
         local BGP speaker's UPDATE messages and advertised to its
         neighbors Section 3.2 [RFC4271].  The Outbound Maximum Prefix
         Limit uses the number of NLRIs per Address Family Identifier
         (AFI) per Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI), after
         application of the Export Policy, as input into its threshold
         comparisons.  For example, when an operator configures the
         Outbound Maximum Prefix Limit for IPv4 Unicast to be 50 on a
         given EBGP session, and were about to announce its 51st IPv4
         Unicast NLRI to the other BGP speaker as a result of the local
         export policy, the session MUST be terminated.

Internet-Draft      Revised BGP Maximum Prefix Limits     September 2019


         Outbound Maximum Prefix Limits are useful to help dampen the
         negative effects of a misconfiguration in local policy.  In
         many cases, it would be more desirable to tear down a BGP
         session rather than causing or propagating a route leak.

6.  Security Considerations

   Maximum Prefix Limits are an essential tool for routing operations
   and SHOULD be used to increase stability.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This memo requests that IANA assigns a new subcode named "Threshold
   exceeded: Self-Destructing, Maximum Number of Prefixes Send" in the
   "Cease NOTIFICATION message subcodes" registry under the "Border
   Gateway Protocol (BGP) Parameters" group.

9.  Implementation status - RFC EDITOR: REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in RFC7942.  The
   description of implementations in this section is intended to assist
   the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to RFCs.
   Please note that the listing of any individual implementation here
   does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort has
   been spent to verify the information presented here that was supplied
   by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not be
   construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   The below table provides an overview (as of the moment of writing) of
   which vendors have produced implementation of inbound or outbound
   maximum prefix limits.  Each table cell shows the applicable
   configuration keywords if the vendor implemented the feature.
