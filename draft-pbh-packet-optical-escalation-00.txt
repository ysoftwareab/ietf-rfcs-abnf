Abstract

   The focus of this memo is on hybrid packet and optical layer
   restoration architectures. We start with an initial description of
   general restoration related aspects, and analyze various restoration
   schemes and focuses on one key aspect: efficient inter-working
   between packet and optical layer restoration mechanisms. This
   analysis results in potential control protocols enhancements
   required to achieve the fast-restoration targets.

1. Introduction - Scope

   In the context of packet-over-optical networks, also known Packet û
   over-Wavelength (POW) networks, restoration depends on the service
   being offered. It can happen either at the packet layer, the optical
   layer or both. In the latter case, coordination between the various
   restoration schemes is required to maximize efficiency.

2. Restoration Strategies

   Prior to restoration, fault detection and fault localization must be
   performed. This can happen at the packet and/or optical layer.
   Nevertheless, fault detection and location can be performed
   simultaneously (within the same layer). Various mechanisms can be
   used to achieve this (some of them may be extended for the hybrid
   packet/optical case). Following propagation of failure to the nodes
   responsible for restoration, restoration is performed.

   In all possible cases, we assume that both the packet and optical
   layers have their own control entities (in a general case, these are
   instantiations of various signaling, routing and management
   protocols). No assumption is made on the physical location of these
   control entities. They could be centralized, distributed, with
   dynamic or static behavior.

   For efficient packet/optical interaction, an interaction between the
   packet and optical control entities is required. The so-called
   integrated packet/optical control entity (similar to the concept of
   a Packet/Optical Network Controller, we will call it PONC in the
   latter) should be informed as soon as possible of the failures and
   their location. PONC may or may not be involved in the restoration
   based on the selected scheme, but can be responsible for overall
   network re-optimization once the restoration is performed.

   Optical network re-optimization implies to define what a Lambda-LSP
   restoration requires. Consequently, we need to first define what re-
   optimization means. This in turn requires to define which are the
   constraints to keep the same topology that the one prior to the
   failure or take into account the updated "availability" values into
   account in order to have a new topology (in fact this could be
   mapped to a dampening mechanism).

   Our analysis covers different scenarios. All of these scenarios
   consider cases where failures occur at Layer1. In the case of
   Layer2/Layer3 failure, the packet layer is the entity responsibly
   for recovering the failure. Also, these scenarios consider failures
   within the optical network and not packet to optical access failures
   (physical connectivity between packet and optical device). In the
   latter case, alternative strategies may be used at both the packet
   and optical layer (most of these will have a M:N, 1:N, 1:1 or access
   path protection while relying on Sonet/SDH overhead for failure

   detection. If no physical protection then Layer3 should handle the
   restoration).

   The approach should be Sonet/SDH or even G.709 independent (the
   target of IPO and OIF are packet over lambda switching). It should
   also define the appropriate mechanisms to allow the packet and
   optical layers to efficiently cooperate while providing the required
   restoration. This implies that the control plane mechanisms
   currently defined in [GMPLS-SIG] need to be extended.

3. Escalation Strategies

3.1 Scenarios

   The various scenarios analyzed here are described as follows:

   1. The optical layer handles the restoration: in this case, the
   restoration will be transparent to the packet layer. This is
   generally achieved by having pre-provisioned (or not) optical paths
   in a 1+1, 1:1 or 1:N scheme within the optical network or
   establishing them when required. See [IPO-REST] where optical-layer
   restoration mechanisms are fully detailed.

   2. The packet layer handles the restoration. In this case, under the
   assumption that the packet layer is made aware of the Layer 1
   failure within the optical network (through GMPLS Notification or
   through PONC for example), the packet layer handles the restoration
   by putting traffic over alternate paths that have not been affected
   by the failure. The restoration path can be either pre-established
   or established on request by the packet layer. PONC can in turn
   perform a longer term overall network optimization.

   3. The packet and optical layer coordinate the overall restoration:
   This can happen in various scenarios. For example, the optical is
   responsible for restoration but is not able to find sufficient
   optical bandwidth within the optical network or in a similar way,
   the packet layer is responsible for restoration but can not fit the
   restored traffic onto alternate unaffected Layer-3 paths. In both of
   these cases, the optical and packet layers should cooperate to
   achieve the right recovery. In this case, it is important to make
   sure that restoration at both levels does interact positively. For
   example, hold-down timers may be used to inform one of the layers to
   wait until the results of the action performed by the other layer is
   known. However, by combining inter-layer synchronization a better
   restoration time should be achieved.


3.2 Packet/Optical Layer Interaction and Escalation Strategy

   This section focuses on the inter-working aspects of packet and
   optical restoration aspects.

   The escalation strategy is defined by the set of detection functions
   describing the originating failure, the protection functions applied
   within recovery process to recover the failure and the interaction
   between the upper and/or lower layers protection functions applied
   during the recovery process. The escalation strategies are governed
   either by arbitrarily setting failure detection and recovery
   completion time or by explicit message exchange between the layers.

   Two main escalation strategies (also referred to as inter-working
   strategy) are currently defined and briefly summarized here:

   - Bottom-up strategy starts at closest layer to the failure
   (generally the bottom layer) and escalates toward the upper layer
   upon expiration of the recovery timer (hold-off timer). This timer
   is defined in such a way that is allocates ôenough timeö the lower
   layer(s) to detect the failure, execute the recovery process and
   recovery completion time before triggering recovery process defined
   at the higher layer(s).

   - Top-down strategy starts at the upper(most) layer and escalates
   downward to the lower layer(s); depending on the working level, the
   top-down strategy is suitable when each of the layers define Class-
   of-Services (CoS) so that the escalation strategy might take this
   CoS into account when executing the recovery process.

   Combination of these strategies known as Hybrid Strategy refers to
   strategies where both upper (in this case the packet/MPLS) layer and
   the lower layer collaborate in order to achieve the fastest
   restoration.

3.3 Bottom-Up Strategy

   We assume here a classical Bottom-up strategy since it has the
   shortest recovery time (with respect to the Top-Down escalation
   strategy), and define the threshold at which the upper-layer
   protection needs to be ôexecutedö.

   In packet LSP over optical rings, the following escalation strategy
   can be defined, where the physical layer (optical transmission)
   triggers the OCh layer protection mechanism and Subsequently, if
   this mechanism does not restore the connection within a given
   maximum restoration time the upper layer (LSP restoration mechanism
   is performed).

   Fiber Layer  <==> Physical Interface <==> Layer-1 Mechanisms


   In optical SDH/Sonet rings, the following escalation strategy can be
   defined, where the OTN layer generally refer to OMS/Line layer and
   be compared to classical TDM SDH/Sonet or G.709 based Rings:

   Packet Layer     <==> PSC interface         <==> GMPLS Signaling

       |                                                   |
       |                                                   |

       ^
       |
       |
       | 
   TS (OTS) Layer   <==> Physical Interface    <==> Layer-1 Mechanisms

   This approach is based on common coordination achieved by resorting
   escalation strategies. At each level, the resiliency scheme is
   activated sequentially starting from the lower to the upper layer.
   This imply that at each level the detection of a failure condition
   (and restoration time) triggers either a restoration/protection
   mechanism and if the restoration completion time is reached then
   triggers an upper-layer restoration/protection mechanism.

3.4 Top-Down Strategy

   Top-down strategy starts at the upper-(most) layer and escalates
   downward to the lower layer(s); depending on the working level, the
   top-down strategy is suitable when each of the layers define Class-
   of-Services (CoS) so that the escalation strategy might take this
   CoS into account when executing the recovery process.

3.5 Hybrid Strategy

   The hybrid strategy can be represented as follows:

   Packet Layer <==> PSC interface      <==> GMPLS Signaling
       |                                            ^
       |                                            |
       v                                            |
                                                    |
                                                    |
                                                    v
   OCh Layer    <==> LSC interface      <==> GMPLS Signaling


       ^
       |
       | 
   OTS Layer    <==> Physical Interface <==> Layer-1 Mechanisms


4. Restoration Timing

   In the hybrid model, the timing plays a very important role. The
   idea is to define a restoration hold-off timer per layer but also a
   restoration quantum time (i.e. a restoration interval) during which
   synchronization of the restoration between layers can occur.

5. Protocol Extensions

   TBD.

6. Security Considerations

   Security considerations are of primary concern when speaking about
   multi-layer processes. However those are left for further study.
