          1.  Status of this Memo

          This draft document will be submitted to the RFC editor as an
          experimental extension to the SNMP MIB.  Distribution of this
          memo is unlimited.  Please send comments to the editors.

          2.  Abstract

          This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
          Information Base (MIB) for use with network management
          protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.  In particular, it
          defines objects for managing DS3 objects.  This document is a
          companion document with Experimental Definitions of Managed
          Objects for the DS1 Interface Type.

          This memo does not specify a standard for the Internet
          community.

          3.  Historical Perspective

          As reported in RFC 1052, IAB Recommendations for the
          Development of Internet Network Management Standards [1], a
          two-prong strategy for network management of TCP/IP-based
          internets was undertaken.  In the short-term, the Simple
          Network Management Protocol (SNMP), defined in RFC 1067, was
          to be used to manage nodes in the Internet community.  In the
          long-term, the use of the OSI network management framework was
          to be examined.  Two documents were produced to define the
          management information: RFC 1065, which defined the Structure
          of Management Information (SMI), and RFC 1066, which defined
          the Management Information Base (MIB).  Both of these
          documents were designed so as to be compatible with both the
          SNMP and the OSI network management framework.

          This strategy was quite successful in the short-term:
          Internet-based network management technology was fielded, by
          both the research and commercial communities, within a few
          months.  As a result of this, portions of the Internet
          community became network manageable in a timely fashion.

          As reported in RFC 1109, Report of the Second Ad Hoc Network
          Management Review Group [2], the requirements of the SNMP and
          the OSI network management frameworks were more different than
          anticipated.  As such, the requirement for compatibility
          between the SMI/MIB and both frameworks was suspended.  This
          action permitted the operational network management framework,
          based on the SNMP, to respond to new operational needs in the
          Internet community by producing MIB-II.

          In May of 1990, the core documents were elevated to "Standard
          Protocols" with "Recommended" status.  As such, the Internet-
          standard network management framework consists of: Structure
          and Identification of Management Information for TCP/IP-based
          internets, RFC 1155 [3], which describes how managed objects
          contained in the MIB are defined; Management Information Base
          for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets, which
          describes the managed objects contained in the MIB, RFC 1156
          [4]; and, the Simple Network Management Protocol, RFC 1157
          [5], which defines the protocol used to manage these objects.

          Consistent with the IAB directive to produce simple, workable
          systems in the short-term, the list of managed objects defined
          in the Internet-standard MIB was derived by taking only those

          elements which are considered essential.  However, the SMI
          defined three extensibility mechanisms: one, the addition of
          new standard objects through the definitions of new versions
          of the MIB; two, the addition of widely-available but non-
          standard objects through the experimental subtree; and three,
          the addition of private objects through the enterprises
          subtree.  Such additional objects can not only be used for
          vendor-specific elements, but also for experimentation as
          required to further the knowledge of which other objects are
          essential.

          This memo defines extensions to the MIB using the second
          method.  It contains definitions of managed objects used for
          experimentation.

          4.  Objects

          Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,
          termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the
          MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation
          One (ASN.1) [7] defined in the SMI.  In particular, each
          object has a name, a syntax, and an encoding.  The name is an
          object identifier, an administratively assigned name, which
          specifies an object type.  The object type together with an
          object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific
          instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we often
          use a textual string, termed the OBJECT DESCRIPTOR, to also
          refer to the object type.

          The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data
          structure corresponding to that object type.  The ASN.1
          language is used for this purpose.  However, the SMI [3]
          purposely restricts the ASN.1 constructs which may be used.
          These restrictions are explicitly made for simplicity.

          The encoding of an object type is simply how that object type
          is represented using the object type's syntax.  Implicitly
          tied to the notion of an object type's syntax and encoding is
          how the object type is represented when being transmitted on
          the network.  The SMI specifies the use of the basic encoding
          rules of ASN.1 [8], subject to the additional requirements
          imposed by the SNMP.

          4.1.  Format of Definitions

          Section 6 contains contains the specification of all object
          types contained in this MIB module.  The object types are
          defined using the conventions defined in the SMI, as amended
          by the extensions specified in [13,14].

          Internet Draft           DS3 Objects              October 1990


          5.  Overview

          These objects are used when the particular media being used to
          realize an interface is a DS3 interface.  At present, this
          applies to these values of the ifType variable in the
          Internet-standard MIB:

               ds3 (30)

          The definitions contained herein are based on the DS3
          specifications in ANSI T1.102-1987, ANSI T1.107-1988, and ANSI
          T1.404-1989 [9,10,11].

          5.1.  Binding between Interfaces and CSUs

          Each agent which resides on a host which uses DS3 interfaces
          is required to assign a small, non-negative integer uniquely
          to each CSU.  This is known as the "CSUIndex", and is used to
          distinguish between different CSUs attached to a node.  The
          CSUIndex is also used as the `key' when accessing tabular
          information about DS3 interfaces.

          The ds3Index column of the DS3 Configuration table relates
          each CSU to its corresponding interface in the Internet-
          standard MIB.

          5.2.  Objectives of this MIB Module

          There are numerous things that could be included in a MIB for
          DS3 signals: the management of multiplexors, CSUs, DSUs, and
          the like.  The intent of this document is to facilitate the
          common management of CSUs, both in-chassis and external via
          proxy.  As such, a design decision was made up front to very
          closely align the MIB with the set of objects that can
          generally be read from CSUs that are currently deployed.

          5.3.  Unsupported Counters

          A reference to a counter which is unreadable or inappropriate
          to the local device should not result in an error return, but
          in a value which means "I don't know".  To this end, any
          Counter in this specification may return the value Hexadecimal
          FFFFFFFF == Decimal 4294967295 to indicate an unsupported,
          unavailable, or inappropriate, counter.

          5.4.  DS3 Terminology

          The terminology used in this document to describe error
          conditions on a DS3 circuit as monitored by a DS3 CSU are from
          the ANSI T1M1.3/90 draft standard [12].

          Out of Frame event
               An OOF event is detected when any three or more errors in
               sixteen or fewer consecutive F-bits occur within a DS3
               M-frame.  An OOF event is cleared when reframe occurs.

          Loss of Signal
               This state is declared upon observing 175 +/- 75
               contiguous pulse positions with no pulses of either
               positive or negative polarity.

          Coding Violation
               For all DS3 applications, a coding violation is a P-bit
               Parity Error event.  A P-bit Parity Error event is the
               occurrence of a received P-bit code on the DS3 M-frame
               that is not identical to the corresponding locally-
               calculated code.  For C-Bit Parity applications, it is
               also the occurrence of a received CP-Bit parity
               violation.  For SYNTRAN applications, it is also the
               occurrence of a received CRC-9 code that is not identical
               to the corresponding locally calculated code.

          Bipolar Violation
               A bipolar violation, for B3ZS-coded signals, is the
               occurrence of a received bipolar violation that is not
               part of a zero-substitution code.  For B3ZS-coded
               signals, a bipolar violation may also include other error
               patterns such as:  three or more consecutive zeros and
               incorrect parity.

          Errored Seconds
               An ES is a second with one or more Coding Violation OR
               one or more Out of Frame events OR an AIS.

          Bursty Errored Seconds
               A BES is a second with more than one and less that 44
               Coding Violations.

          Severely Errored Seconds
               A SES is a second with 44 or more Coding Violations OR

          Internet Draft           DS3 Objects              October 1990


               one or more Out of Frame events OR an AIS.

          Severely Errored Framing Seconds
               A SEFS is a second with one or more Out of Frame events.

          Red Alarm
               The Red Alarm is declared after detecting a Loss of
               Signal, a Loss of Frame (a persistent OOF event), or an
               Alarm Indication Signal, see [10] for at least 2-10
               seconds.  The Red Alarm is cleared at the onset of 10
               consecutive seconds with no SES.

          Yellow Alarm
               The Yellow Alarm is declared after detecting the Yellow
               Signal.  See ANSI T1.107-1989 [10].

          Unavailable Seconds
               UAS are calculated by counting the number of seconds that
               the CSU is in the Unavailable signal state (i.e.,
               declared a Red Alarm or a Yellow Alarm), including the
               initial 10 seconds to enter the state but not including
               the 10 seconds to exit the state.

               Note that any second that may be counted as an UAS may
               not be counted as an ES, a BES, or a SES.  Since the 10
               SESs that comprise the transition from the available to
               unavailable signal state may also be counted as ESs,
               BESs, and SESs previous to entering the state, these
               three counters are adjusted so that any second counted
               during this transition is then subtracted.  The 10
               seconds in the transition from unavailable to available
               may be counted as ESs or BESs.

               A special case exists when the 10 or more second period
               crosses the 900 second statistics window boundary, as the
               foregoing description implies that the SES and UAS
               counters must be adjusted when the Unavailable Signal
               State is entered. Clearly, successive GETs of the
               affected DS3IntervalSES and DS3IntervalUAS objects will
               return differing values if the first GET occurs during
               the first few seconds of the window.  This is viewed as
               an unavoidable side-effect of selecting the presently
               defined managed objects as a basis for this memo.
