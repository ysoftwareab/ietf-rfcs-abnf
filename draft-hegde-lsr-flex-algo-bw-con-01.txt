     Flexible Algorithms: Bandwidth, Delay, Metrics and Constraints
                  draft-hegde-lsr-flex-algo-bw-con-01

Abstract

   Many networks configure the link metric relative to the link
   capacity.  High bandwidth traffic gets routed as per the link
   capacity.  Flexible algorithms provides mechanisms to create
   constraint based paths in IGP.  This draft documents a set of
   bandwidth related constraints to be used in Flexible Algorithms.

1.  Introduction

   High bandwidth traffic such as residential internet traffic and
   machine to machine elephant flows benefit from using high capacity
   links for the traffic.  Many network operators define link metric
   relative to the link capacity.  It may be useful to exclude the high
   bandwidth traffic from utilizing links below certain capacity.  A
   Flex-Algorithm [I-D.ietf-lsr-flex-algo] is defined as a set of
   parameters consisting of calculation-type, metric-type and a set of
   constraints.  It is very convenient to define a Flex-Algorithm that
   uses bandwidth based metric-type which can be used for carrying high
   bandwidth traffic.  In this regard, it's useful to define additional
   metric-type and additional bandwidth related constraints to simplify
   the operations.

   This document specifies a new metric-type to be used in Flex-
   Algorithm described in section Section 2.  Additional Flexible
   Algorithm Definition (FAD) constraints are defined in section
   Section 3.  Section 4 defines mechanisms to automatically calculate
   metric based on parameters defined in a FAD constraint and the
   advertised Maximum Link Bandwidth of the link.

2.  Bandwidth Metric Advertisement

   ISIS and OSPF advertise link metric in their respective link
   information.  Multiple types of metric are supported, IGP cost, te-
   metric defined in [RFC5305] and [RFC3630] and delay metric defined in
   [RFC8570] and [RFC7471].  A brownfield network might have deployed
   legacy transport mechanisms using igp-cost and te-metric which
   continue to run during migration period.  In this brownfield network
   if the operator wants to introduce two Flex-Algorithms, one for delay
   metric and another for bandwidth metric, a new metric-type to carry

   bandwidth related metric would be needed.  The IGP cost and te-metric
   may be already used by legacy applications and may not be available
   to carry link bandwidth based metric.  This document defines a new
   metric called bandwidth metric.  ISIS and OSPF will advertise this
   new type of metric in their link information.  This document also
   defines a new metric-type called "Bandwidth Metric" in the FAD sub-
   TLV.

2.1.  ISIS Bandwidth Metric sub-TLV

   The ISIS Bandwidth Metric sub-TLV specifies the link metric based on
   link bandwidth.  Typically, this metric is assigned by a network
   administrator.  The Bandwidth Metric sub-TLV is advertised in below
   TLVs/sub-TLVs

      TLV-22 (Extended IS reachability) [RFC5305]

      TLV-222 (MT-ISN) [RFC5120]

                  Figure 1: ISIS Bandwidth Metric sub-TLV

   The Bandwidth Metric sub-TLV MUST be advertised only once.  If there
   are multiple Bandwidth Metric sub-TLVs advertised for a link in one
   or more received LSPDUs, the first one MUST be used and the
   subsequent ones MUST be ignored.

2.2.  OSPF Bandwidth Metric sub-TLV

   The Bandwidth Metric sub-TLV specifies the link metric based on link
   bandwidth.  Typically, this metric is assigned by a network
   administrator.  The Bandwidth Metric sub-TLV is advertised in below
   TLVs

      sub-TLV of the OSPF Link TLV of OSPF extended Link LSA [RFC7684].

      sub-TLV of TE Link TLV (2) of OSPF TE LSA [RFC3630].

      8920]

   The Bandwidth Metric sub-TLV is TLV type TBD (IANA), and is four
   octets in length.

                  Figure 2: OSPF Bandwidth Metric sub-TLV

   The Bandwidth Metric sub-TLV MUST be advertised only once.  If there
   are multiple Bandwidth Metric sub-TLVs in a received Link TLV, the
   first one MUST be used and the subsequent ones MUST be ignored.

3.  FAD constraint sub-TLVs

   It is useful to exclude Links having capacity lower than a minimum
   value from the Flex-Algorithm topology that is designed to carry high
   bandwidth traffic.  This can be achieved by associating link affinity
   to the lower capacity links and advertise exclude link constraint in
   the FAD for that link affinity.  This works well where the link
   capacity is constant.  When a Layer 3 link is collection of Layer 2
   links (LAG/Layer 2 Bundle), the link bandwidth varies based on the
   constituent link going up and down.  The operator has to constantly
   monitor the link capacity and assign appropriate link affinity if
   link capacity changes beyond minimum value.  In certain cases, the

Internet-Draft    Flex-Algorithm Bandwidth Constraints        March 2021


   minimum link bandwidth required may change based on the applications
   that use the high bandwidth Flex-Algo.  This document proposes a new
   Exclude Minimum Bandwidth constraint.  When this constraint is
   advertised in a FAD, based on the advertised link bandwidth, the link
   will be pruned from the Flex-Algorithm topology if the link's
   advertised Maximum Link Bandwidth is below the FAD advertised Minimum
   bandwidth value.

   Similarly, exclude maximum link delay constraint is also defined in
   this document.  Links may have the link delay measured dynamically
   and advertised in delay metric in IGP.  For use cases that deploy
   dynamic link delay measurement, A Flex-Algorithm may want to exclude
   links that have link delay more than a defined threshold.

3.1.1.  ISIS Exclude Minimum Bandwidth sub-TLV

   ISIS Flex-Algorithm Exclude Minimum Bandwidth sub-TLV (FAEMB) is a

      floating point format.  The units are bytes per second.

                       Figure 3: ISIS FAEMB sub-TLV

   The FAEMB sub-TLV MUST appear only once in the FAD sub-TLV.  If it
   appears more than once, the ISIS FAD Sub-TLV MUST be ignored by the
   receiver.  The Minimum bandwidth advertised in FAEMB sub-TLV MUST be
   compared with Maximum Link Bandwidth advertised in sub-sub-TLV 9 of
   ASLA sub-TLV [RFC 8919].  If L-Flag is set in the ASLA sub-TLV, the
   Minimum bandwidth advertised in FAEMB sub-TLV MUST be compared with
   Maximum Link Bandwidth as advertised by the sub-TLV 9 of the TLV
   22/222/23/223/141 [RFC 5305] as defined in [RFC8919] Section 4.2.  If
   the Maximum Link Bandwidth is lower than the Minimum link bandwidth

   advertised in FAEMB sub-TLV, the link MUST be excluded from the Flex-
   Algorithm topology.  If a link does not have the Maximum Link
   Bandwidth advertised but the FAD contains this sub-TLV, then that
   link MUST be included in the topology and proceed to apply further
   pruning rules for the link.

3.1.2.  ISIS Exclude Maximum Delay sub-TLV

   ISIS Flex-Algorithm Exclude Maximum Delay sub-TLV (FAEMD) is a sub-
   TLV of the ISIS FAD sub-TLV.  It has the following format.

                       Figure 4: ISIS FAEMD sub-TLV

   The FAEMD sub-TLV MUST appear only once in the FAD sub-TLV.  If it
   appears more than once, the ISIS FAD Sub-TLV MUST be ignored by the
   receiver.  The Maximum link delay advertised in FAEMD sub-TLV MUST be
   compared with Min Unidirectional Link Delay advertised in sub-sub-TLV
   34 of ASLA sub-TLV [RFC 8919].  If L-Flag is set in the ASLA sub-TLV,
   the Maximum link delay advertised in FAEMD sub-TLV MUST be compared
   with Min Unidirectional Link Delay as advertised by the sub-TLV 34 of
   the TLV 22/222/23/223/141 [RFC 8570] as defined in [RFC8919]
   Section 4.2.  If the Min Unidirectional Link Delay value is higher
   than the Maximum link delay advertised in FAEMD sub-TLV, the link
   MUST be excluded from the Flex-Algorithm topology.  If a link does
   not have the Min Unidirectional Link Delay advertised but the FAD
   contains this sub-TLV, then that link MUST be included in the
   topology and proceed to apply further pruning rules for the link.

   The FAEMB sub-TLV MUST appear only once in the FAD sub-TLV.  If it
   appears more than once, the OSPF FAD TLV MUST be ignored by the
   receiver.  The Maximum Link Bandwidth as advertised by the sub-sub-

   The FAEMD sub-TLV MUST appear only once in the OSPF FAD TLV.  If it
   appears more than once, the OSPF FAD TLV MUST be ignored by the
   receiver.  The Min Unidirectional Link Delay as advertised by sub-
   sub-TLV 12 of ASLA sub-TLV [RFC 8920], MUST be compared against the
   Maximum delay advertised in FAEMD sub-TLV.  If the Min Unidirectional
   Link Delay is higher than the Maximum delay advertised in FAEMD sub-
   TLV, the link MUST be excluded from the Flex-Algorithm topology.  If
   a link does not have the Min Unidirectional Link Delay advertised but
   the FAD contains this sub-TLV, then that link MUST be included in the
   topology and proceed to apply further pruning rules for the link.

4.  Automatic Metric Calculation

   Networks which are designed to be highly regular and follow uniform
   metric assignment may want to further simplify the operations by
   automatically calculating the metric based on a reference bandwidth
   or a staircase metric assignment based on bandwidth thresholds.  When
   a FAD advertises metric-type as Bandwidth Metric and the link does
   not have the Bandwidth Metric advertised, automatic metric derivation
   can be used with additional FAD constraint advertisements as
   described in this section.  Based on the advertised rules, every node
   automatically calculates the link metric of all the links in the
   Flex-Algorithm before running SPF algorithm for the Flex-Alogrithm.

   Based on the delay in learning the link bandwidth changes on a remote
   link, there may be possibility of micro-loops which is no different
   from IGP susceptibility to micro-loops during metric change.  The
   micro-loop avoidance procedures described in
   [I-D.bashandy-rtgwg-segment-routing-uloop] can be used to avoid
   micro-loops when the automatic metric calculation is deployed.

4.1.  Automatic Metric Calculation Modes

4.1.1.  Simple Mode

   In simple mode, the Maximum Link Bandwidth of a single Layer 3 link
   is used to derive the metric.  This mode is more suitable for
   deployments that use Layer 2 bundles for parallel links between two
   nodes.  This layer 3 link may consist of Layer 2 bundles.  In such
   cases, the bandwidth of the link may vary based on Layer 2 links
   going up/down.

4.1.2.  Interface Group Mode

   Simple mode of metric calculation may not work well when there are
   multiple parallel layer 3 interfaces between two nodes.

           A------B====C====F====D
                  |              |
                   ------E-------

                       Figure 7: Parallel interfaces

   In the above diagram, there are two parallel links between B->C,
   C->F, F->D.  Let us assume the link bandwidth is uniform 10Gbps on
   all links.  When Simple mode of metric derivation is used, the metric
   is derived as 10 on all links.  Traffic will be forwarded B->E->D.
   Since the bandwidth is higher B->C->F->D path, the requirement is to
   be able to assign smaller metric based on cumulative bandwidth of the
   parallel links.  Interface group mode is suitable for deployments
   that do not use Layer 2 bundles.

   In the interface group mode, every node MUST identify the set of
   parallel links between a pair of nodes based on IGP link
   advertisements and MUST consider cumulative bandwidth of the parallel
   links while arriving at the metric of each link.

4.2.  Automatic Metric Calculation Methods

   In automatic metric calculation for simple and interface group mode,
   Maximum Link Bandwidth of the links is used to derive the metric.
   There are two types of automatic metric derivation methods.

      1.  Reference bandwidth method

      2.  Bandwidth thresholds method

4.2.1.  Reference Bandwidth method

   In many networks, the metric is assigned relative to the link
   bandwidth.  The metric is derived by dividing the reference bandwidth
   by the advertised Maximum Link Bandwidth.  It is useful to advertise
   reference bandwidth in FAD constraints to simplify operations.  When
   there are changes to the reference bandwidth it can be easily changed
   on FAD server rather than having to change it on every node.  In
   order to ensure that small bandwidth changes do not change the link
   metric, it is useful to define a round-off value.  The link bandwidth
   will be rounded-off with this value before deriving the metric.  For
   example,

      reference bandwidth = 1000G

      round off value = 20G

      The derived metric is 10 for link bandwidth in the range 100G to
      119G

4.2.2.  Bandwidth Thresholds method

   The round-off bw along with reference bandwidth approach described
   above provides a uniform metric value for a range of link bandwidth.
   In certain cases there may be a need to define non-proportional
   metric values for the varying ranges of link bandwidth.  For Example,
   10G to 30G metric value is 100, 30G to 70G metric value is 50,
   greater than 70G metric is 10.  In order to support this, a staircase
   metric based on bandwidth threshold is supported in the FAD.  This
   advertisement contains a set of threshold values and their associated
   metric.

   Min, the MAX_METRIC value of 4,294,967,296 MUST be assigned as the
   Bandwidth Metric on the link during Flex-Algorithm SPF calculation.

   When the computed link bandwidth is greater than or equal to
   Bandwidth Threshold 1 Min AND less than Bandwidth Threshold 1 Max,
   Threshold Metric 1 MUST be assigned as the Bandwidth Metric on the
   link during Flex-Algorithm SPF calculation.

   Similarly, when the computed link bandwidth is greater than or equal
   to Bandwidth Threshold 1 Max AND less than Bandwidth Threshold 2 Max,
   Threshold Metric 2 MUST be assigned as the Bandwidth Metric on the
   link during Flex-Algorithm SPF calculation.

   Similarly, when the computed link bandwidth is greater than or equal
   to Bandwidth Threshold n-1 Max, Threshold Metric n MUST be assigned
   as the Bandwidth Metric on the link during Flex-Algorithm SPF
   calculation.

   The OSPF FADBT Sub-TLV MUST NOT appear more than once in an OSPF FAD
   TLV.  If it appears more than once, the OSPF FAD TLV MUST be ignored
   by the receiver.

   A FAD MUST NOT contain both FADBT sub-TLV and FADRB sub-TLV.  If both
   these sub-TLVs are advertised in the same FAD (winner FAD) for a
   Flexible Algorithm, the receiving nodes MUST stop participating in
   such Flexible-Algorithm

   If a Bandwidth Metric sub-TLV is advertised for a link, the Flex-
   Algorithm calculation MUST use the Bandwidth Metric advertised on the
   link, and MUST NOT use the automatically derived metric for that
   link.

5.  Bandwidth metric considerations

   This section specifies the rules of deriving the Bandwidth Metric if
   and only if the winning FAD for the Flex-Algorithm specifies the
   metric-type as "Bandwidth Metric".

      1.  If the the Bandwidth Metric sub-TLV is advertised for the link
      as described in Section 2, it MUST be used during the Flex-
      Algorithm calculation.

      2.  If the Bandwidth Metric sub-TLV is not advertised for the link
      and the winning FAD for the Flex-Algorithm does not specify the
      automatic bandwidth metric calculation (as defined in Section 4 ),
      the Bandwidth Metric is considered as not being advertised for the
      link.

      3.  If the Bandwidth Metric sub-TLV is not advertised for the link
      and the winning FAD for the Flex-Algorithm specifies the automatic
      bandwidth metric calculation (as defined in Section 4), the
      Bandwidth Metric metric MUST be automatically calculated as per
      the procedures defined in Section 4.  If the Bandwidth Metric can
      not be calculated due to lack of Flex-Algorithm specific ASLA
      advertisement of sub-sub-TLV 9 [RFC 8919], or in case of IS-IS, in
      presence of the L-Flag in the Flex-Algorithm specific ASLA
      advertisement the lack of sub-TLV 9 in the TLV 22/222/23/223/141
      [RFC 5305], the Bandwidth Metric is considered as not being
      advertised for the link.

6.  Calculation of Flex-Algorithm paths

   Two new additional rules are added to the existing rules in the Flex-
   rules specified in sec 13 of [I-D.ietf-lsr-flex-algo].

      6.  Check if any exclude FAEMB rule is part of the Flex-Algorithm
      definition.  If such exclude rule exists and the link has Maximum
      Link Bandwidth advertised, check if the link bandwidth satisfies
      the FAEMB rule.  If the link does not satisfy the FAEMB rule, the
      link MUST be pruned from the computation.

      7.  Check if any exclude FAEMD rule is part of the Flex-Algorithm
      definition.  If such exclude rule exists and the link has Min
      Unidirectional link delay advertised, check if the link delay

      satisfies the FAEMD rule.  If the link does not satisfy the FAEMD
      rule, the link MUST be pruned from the computation.
