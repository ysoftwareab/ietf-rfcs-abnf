Abstract

   This document defines a new parameter "enumdi" for the "tel" Uniform
   Resource Identifier (URI) to support the handling of ENUM queries in
   VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) network elements.  A VoIP network
   element may receive an URI containing an E.164 number, where that URI
   contains an "enumdi" parameter.  The presence of the "enumdi"

   parameter indicates that an ENUM query has already been performed on
   the E.164 number by a previous VoIP network element.  Equally, if a
   VoIP network element sends such an URI, it asserts that an ENUM query
   has been carried out on this number.

Internet-Draft   ENUM Dip Indicator "tel" URI parameter    December 2005


1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
   NOT","SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC2119
   [1].


2.  Introduction

   VoIP network elements (including User Agent Servers and User Agent
   Clients) may be set up in different ways to handle E.164 [3] numbers
   during call setup, depending on the capabilities provided.  One
   common approach is to query ENUM as defined in RFC3761 [4], and to
   use the set of NAPTR (Naming Authority Pointer to resource) resource
   records that is returned.

   If the ENUM query leads to a result, the call is set-up accordingly.
   If the ENUM query does not lead finally to a result, another database
   may be queried and/or the call may finally be routed to the PSTN
   (Public Switched Telecommunications Network).  In doing so, the call
   may be routed to another VoIP network element.  To indicate in
   signalling to this next VoIP element that an ENUM query has already
   be made for the "tel" URI (specified in RFC3966 [5]), the "enumdi"
   parameter is used, to prevent the next VoIP network element from
   repeating redundant queries.


3.  Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (ABNF) as described in RFC2234 [2].

   enumdi = *1(enum-dip-indicator)

   enum-dip-indicator = ";enumdi"

   The ENUM Dip Indicator is an optional parameter for the "tel" URI,
   and so the enumdi production above is an example of the parameter
   syntax element described in [5], with enum-dip-indicator being an
   example of the pname production described there.


4.  Normative Rules

   This section discusses how a VoIP network element handles a received
   "tel" URI that contains the "enumdi" parameter or has queried ENUM in
   e164.arpa. for a given E.164 number and needs to add the parameter to

Internet-Draft   ENUM Dip Indicator "tel" URI parameter    December 2005


   a "tel" URI.

4.1.  Handling an URI with the "enumdi" parameter

   If a VoIP network element receives a "tel" URI containing the
   "enumdi" parameter, the VoIP network element SHOULD NOT retrieve the
   related information for this number from ENUM in e164.arpa. even if
   it would normally do so.

   If the received "tel" URI is to be passed to the next network
   element, the VoIP network element MUST pass on the received URI
   containing the "enumdi" parameter unchanged.

4.2.  Adding the "enumdi" parameter to URIs

   When a VoIP network element queries ENUM in e164.arpa. for a given
   E.164 number and the result of the query is NXDOMAIN, if that network
   element chooses to pass the call to the next network element by using
   a "tel" URI, the "enumdi" parameter MUST be set.

   When a VoIP network element queries ENUM in e164.arpa. for a given
   E.164 number and either:
   o  the result of the query includes a NAPTR resource record
      containing a "tel" URI that has the same E.164 number, or
   o  the result of the query includes a NAPTR resource record
      containing a "tel" URI with the "enumdi" parameter set,

   then if that retrieved "tel" URI is chosen to be passed to the next
   network element, the sending VoIP network element MUST pass on the
   retrieved URI with the "enumdi" parameter set.


5.  Examples


   a.  A VoIP network element called server.example.com receives a "tel"
       URI tel:+441632960038.  The VoIP network element queries the DNS
       for NAPTR resource records in 8.3.0.0.6.9.2.3.6.1.4.4.e164.arpa.,
       and gets the response NXDOMAIN.  The VoIP network element decides
       to route the call to the PSTN via another VoIP network element
       called gw.example.com.

          It therefore signals to the next VoIP network element with:
             tel:+441632960038;enumdi
          or (using the procedures of RFC3261 [6] section 19.1.6):
             sip:+441632960038;enumdi@gw.example.com;user=phone

Internet-Draft   ENUM Dip Indicator "tel" URI parameter    December 2005


   b.  A VoIP network element called server.example.com receives a "tel"
       URI tel:+441632960038.  The VoIP network element queries the DNS
       for NAPTR resource records in 8.3.0.0.6.9.2.3.6.1.4.4.e164.arpa.,
       and receives the same "tel" URI in reply (i.e.
       tel:+4416232960038).

       The VoIP network element decides to route the call to the PSTN
       via another VoIP network element called gw.example.com.

          It therefore signals to this next VoIP network element with:
             tel:+441632960038;enumdi
          or (using the procedures of RFC3261 [6] section 19.1.6):
             sip:+441632960038;enumdi@gw.example.com;user=phone


6.  Security Considerations

   In addition to those security implications discussed in the "tel" URI
   [5] specification, there are new security implications associated
   with the defined parameter.

   If the "enumdi" is illegally inserted into the "tel" URI when the
   signalling message carrying the "tel" URI is en route to the
   destination entity, the call may be routed to the PSTN network,
   incurring unexpected charges or causing a downstream VoIP network
   element to reject the call setup.

   It is less a problem if the "enumdi" is illegally removed.  An
   additional ENUM query may be performed to retrieve the routing number
   information and have the "enumdi" included again.

   It is RECOMMENDED that protocols carrying the "tel" URI ensure
   message integrity during the message transfer between the two
   communicating network elements so as to detect any unauthorised
   changes to the content of the "tel" URI and other information.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not itself require any IANA actions.

   It does define a parameter for the "tel" URI.  Further information on
   a registry for such parameters is covered in
   draft-ietf-iptel-tel-reg-00 [10].
