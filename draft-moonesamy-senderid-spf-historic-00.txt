1. Introduction

   In April 2006, RFC 4405, SMTP Service Extension for Indicating the
   Responsible Submitter of an E-Mail Message, RFC 4406, Sender ID:
   Authenticating E-Mail, RFC 4407, Purported Responsible Address in
   E-Mail Messages and RFC 4408, Sender Policy Framework (SPF) were
   published simultaneously as Experimental RFCs.  There was no general
   technical consensus about how to reconcile the two approaches known
   as Sender ID [RFC4406] and SPF [RFC4408].

   This memo recommends that the RFCs specifying the Sender ID and SPF
   experiments, the SMTP Service Extension for Indicating the
   Responsible Submitter of an E-Mail Message [RFC4405] and the
   Purported Responsible Address in E-Mail Messages [RFC4407] be moved
   to Historic.  It also proposes obsoleting the "Received-SPF:" header
   field defined in RFC 4408 [RFC4408].


2.  Reclassification to Historic Status

   The Sender ID experiment reuses DNS records that may have been
   created for SPF. Depending on the content of the record, this may
   mean that Sender ID heuristics can be applied incorrectly to a
   message.  Participants publishing SPF experiment DNS records may
   also be affected if they do not publish Sender ID DNS records. These
   two conflicting experiments can lead to delivery failures or loss of
   mail.

   The community was invited to observe the success or failure of the
   two approaches during the two years following publication of the
   Experimental RFCs.  Since it is over two years and as there is an
   interoperability problem, it is recommended that the Sender ID and
   SPF experiments be concluded.  Therefore, RFC 4405, RFC 4406,
   RFC 4407, and RFC 4408 are reclassified to Historic status.
   RFC 4405, RFC 4406, RFC 4407, and RFC 4408 can also be considered as
   obsolete.


3. Security Considerations

   Reclassification of RFC 4405, RFC 4406, RFC 4407, and RFC 4408 to
   Historic will not have any negative effect on the security of the
   Internet.


4. IANA Considerations

   It is requested that IANA update the "Received-SPF:" header field
