1.  Introduction

1.1.  RPKI Architecture

   In RPKI, CAs (Certification Authorities) are organized in a
   hierarchical structure which is aligned to the existing INR (Internet
   Number Resources, including IP prefixes and AS numbers) allocation
   hierarchy.  Each INR allocation requires corresponding resource
   certificates to attest to it.  Two important resource certificates
   [RFC6480] are needed during this allocation process, and they are CA

   certificates and EE (End-entity) certificates: CA certificates attest
   to the INR holdings; EE certificates are primarily used for the
   validation of ROAs (Route Origin Authorizations) [RFC6482] which is
   used to verify whether an AS is permitted to originate routes to
   specific IP prefixes.  Besides, Manifest [RFC6486] is used to ensure
   the integrity of the repository.

   The process of using RPKI to verify the route origin is as follows.

   1.  CAs, including IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority), 5 RIRs
       (Regional Internet Registries), NIRs (National Internet
       Registries) and ISPs (Internet Service Providers), publish
       authoritative objects (including resource certificates, ROAs,
       Manifest and so on) into the their repositories.

   2.  RPs (Relying Parties) all over the world collect (with the rsync
       protocol for example) and verify (using a validation tool, such
       as rcynic) the PRKI objects from the distributed repositories,
       and provide the results of verification to BGP border routers.

   3.  Finally, BGP border routers can make use of these results to
       verify the route origin information in the BGP messages they have
       received.

1.2.  Status of RPKI Deployment

   The 5 RIRs have finished the deployment of RPKI, and are now offering
   RPKI services to their members.  A number of countries (Ecuador,
   Japan, Bangladesh, etc.) have also started to test and deploy RPKI
   interiorly.  And in order to further promote the deployment of RPKI,
   ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers), the 5
   RIRs and many NIRs and companies have been making continuous efforts
   to solve the existing problems and improve the corresponding policies
   and technical standards.

   However, RPKI is still in its early stages of global deployment.
   According to the data provided by RPKI Dashboard, the current routing
   table holds about 595817 IP prefixes in total, and the RPKI
   validation state has been determined for 38398 IP prefixes, which
   means that only 6.44% of the prefixes in the routing table can be
   validated.  And Table 1 offers a more intuitive display of the RPKI
   "adoption rate" (the percentage of members deployed RPKI) in the 5
   RIRs.

      +---------------+---------+-------+-------+--------+----------+
      | RIR           | AFRINIC | APNIC | ARIN  | LACNIC | RIPE NCC |
      +---------------+---------+-------+-------+--------+----------+
      | Adoption Rate | 0.98%   | 1.96% | 0.83% | 24.04% | 10.3%    |
      +---------------+---------+-------+-------+--------+----------+

                  Table 1.Adoption rate of RPKI in 5 RIRs

   As we can see from Table 1, LACNIC has the highest adoption rate,
   which is about 24.04%. While the adoption rates in ARIN and AFRINIC
   are much lower, which are only 0.83% and 0.98% respectively.

   RIPE NCC provides some statistics regarding the number of resource
   certificates and ROAs in each RIR.  From these statistics we find a
   good sign that the global deployment status of RPKI rises gradually,
   and with its further evolution, the global adoption rate of RPKI will
   get a faster growth.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Considerations of RPKI Deployment

   During the process of incremental deployment of RPKI, a lot of
   technical, economic and political problems have appeared and may
   appear.  In this section, we attempt to collect and analyze the
   problems which are most critical among them.

3.1.  Technical Problems

3.1.1.  More than One TA

   A TA (Trust Anchor) is an authoritative entity represented by a
   public key and its associated data [RFC5914].  The public key acts as
   an authority to verify digital signatures.  And the associated data
   describes the types of information and actions for which the TA is
   authoritative.  There are more than one TA in the RPKI architecture
   today, for example, IANA and 5 RIRs are candidates to be default TAs.

   With more than one TA, there are problems that two or more
   organizations may accidentally or maliciously issue certificates for
   the allocation of the same INRs.  Then it may lead to inconsistent
   and conflicting assertion about to whom the specific INRs have been
   allocated.  This kind of problem obviously may cause resource
   conflicts on the Internet.

3.1.2.  Problems of CAs

3.1.2.1.  Misconfigurations

   Considering misconfiguration is inevitable and the significant impact
   it may cause, misconfiguration of CAs in RPKI is a potential problem
   in actual deployment.

   The misconfiguration of CAs in RPKI will lead to serious consequences
   similar to those caused by malicious attacks (black-hole routes,
   traffic interception, and denial-of-service attacks).  For example,
   misconfigurations of an ROA (such as adding a new ROA, whacking an
   existing ROA) will cause all routes covered by this ROA to become
   invalid.

3.1.2.2.  Unilateral Resource Revocation

   In the RPKI architecture, there is a problem that CAs have the power
   to unilaterally and abusively revoke the INRs which have been
   allocated to their descendents, just by revoking the corresponding CA
   certificates [RFC6480].

   Since revocation of certificates usually leads to taking the resource
   holder offline, the risk of unilateral resource revocation is rather
   serious.

3.1.3.  Global Inconsistency

   The problem of global inconsistency may also be called "mirror world
   attacks".  In mirror world attacks, a malicious CA presents one view
   of the RPKI repository to some RPs, and a different view to others.

   Since a CA in RPKI can control everything in its own repository,
   there are possibilities that a malicious CA may perform these attacks
   easily.  For example, a malicious CA presents the correct view of its
   repository to some RPs, but a forged view (e.g. the CA adds a
   specific ROA deliberately) to the others.  When these deceived RPs
   offer their validation results to BGP routers, the routers may
   abandon the legitimate routes which are considered to be invalid
   according to the validation results they have received.

3.1.4.  Data Synchronization

   It is required in [RFC6480] that all repositories must be accessible
   via rsync protocol which is used for RPs to get the RPKI objects in
   the global distributed repositories.  However, the rsync protocol is
   considered to be controversial with its following disadvantages:




Lee, et al.             Expires January 29, 2016                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft      draft-lee-sidr-rpki-deployment-00          July 2015


   1.  Lack of standards and non-modular implementation: Although rsync
       is widely adopted in backup, restore, and file transfer, it has
       not been standardized by IETF.  And the rsync implementation is
       non-modular, making it difficult to use its source code.

   2.  Not good enough in efficiency, scalability and security: Rsync is
       efficient when it is used between one client and one server.
       However, in RPKI a large number of clients may regularly connect
       to the repository server at the same time.  Rsync is not
       efficient and scalable enough to deal with this concurrent case.
       Moreover, rsync itself provides little security (no content
       encryption and weak authentication especially in old versions)
       while transferring data.

   3.  Underlying overhead caused by repository updates during active
       data transmissions: During data transmissions between RPs and the
       repository, a new update to the repository may cause data
       inconsistency between them.  And in order to rectify this
       inconsistency, extra overhead costs (such as performing the
       synchronization once more) are required.

3.1.5.  Problems of Staged and Incomplete Deployment

   Since the global deployment of RPKI is an incremental and staged
   process, a lot of unexpected issues may appear during this process.
   Let's take an example to explain why the incomplete deployment of
   RPKI may cause legitimate routes to be misclassified into invalid.
   In Fig.1, we make the following assumptions:

   1.  CNNIC, ISP1 and ISP2 have deployed the RPKI, but ISP3 have not
       yet.

   2.  CNNIC allocated IP prefix 218.241.104.0/22 to ISP1 and
       218.241.108.0/22 to ISP2.

   3.  Three ROAs (ROA1, ROA2, ROA3) are issued respectively by CNNIC,
       ISP1 and ISP2.

                Fig.1: An example of incomplete deployment

   Now ISP3 announces to be the origination of 218.241.106.0/23.  When
   other entities receive this announcement, they can validate it with
   ROAs information.  Since prefix 218.241.104.0/22 described in ROA2
   encompasses prefix 218.241.106.0/23 and no matching ROA describes
   218.241.106.0/23 could be found [RFC6487], the announcement for
   prefix 218.241.106.0/23 will be considered to be invalid.

3.1.6.  Low Validation Accuracy

   The route origin validation accuracy refers to the percentage of
   valid routes. i.e., Accuracy = number_of_valid_routes /
   (number_of_valid_routes + number_of_invalid_routes).

   As we can see from Table 2, the accuracy of route origin validation
   in the 5 RIRs differs a lot.  LACNIC and RIPE NCC have the highest
   validation accuracy and both of them are over 90%, while the accuracy
   in AFRINIC is less than 70%. Many reasons may account for the low
   validation accuracy, such as misconfigurations, low adoption rates,
   etc.

   +---------+-------+-------+---------+---------+----------+----------+

           Table 2.  Route Origin Validation Accuracy in 5 RIRs

   When comparing the last two columns in Table 2, it can be found that
   a higher RPKI adoption rate tends to result in a higher validation
   accuracy.  And this tendency can be explained by the example we
   present in section 3.1.5.

3.2.  Economic Problems

   To adopt RPKI, ISPs may need to deploy and maintain servers running
   as RPs, which means that ISPs have to take on more costs, including
   more responsibilities, more time and more money.

   Besides, the route origin validation in RPKI has been designed to be
   adopted on current BGP routers.  In order to realize the validation,
   the border routers need to be upgraded to accommodate some additions,
   such as the "Route Validation Database", which means that with the
   deployment of RPKI, there are additional costs to upgrade the network
   equipments.

3.3.  Political Problems

   RPKI provides a hierarchical architecture to improve the inter-domain
   routing security, however, it also induces power imbalance.

   The most obvious example of power imbalance is Unilateral Resource
   Revocations which we have introduced in section 3.1.2.2.  And this
   revocation may be driven by business disputes and political
   disagreements.

4.  Alternative Solutions to RPKI Deployment Risks

   In this section, we give and analyze the related alternative
   solutions and strategies to solve or mitigate the problems mentioned
   in Section 3.

4.1.  Solutions to Technical Problems

4.1.1.  Solutions to Multiple TAs

   RIRs are trying to continually evolve RPKI, including the migration
   to a single GTA (Global Trust Anchor) as the root of the RPKI
   hierarchical structure.  ICANN and RIRs have developed and deployed a
   technical testbed with an RPKI GTA.  It's assumed that there must be
   a single root trust anchor eventually.  With this single root trust
   anchor deployed, the risks of resource conflicts on the Internet
   could be reduced a lot.

   However, this solution entitles more power to ICANN and exacerbates
   the risk of "power imbalance" mentioned in section 3.3.

4.1.2.  Solutions to Misbehaved CAs

   1) "Consent" Solution

   To resolve the problems of unilateral resource revocation, Heilman et
   al. proposed a mechanism to improve the transparency of RPKI.  They
   also offer some tools which can detect changes to the RPKI, for
   example, the CA revokes a resource certificate.  The main idea of
   this mechanism is that any revocation of INRs requires consent from
   all impacted parties.  And the consent comes in the form of a ".dead"
   object which is constructed recursively to ensure that every entities
   impacted could be notified.

   This mechanism balances the power between the CAs in the RPKI
   hierarchical architecture to resolve the problem of unilateral
   resource revocation.

   2) "Suspenders" Solution

   S.  Kent et al. also put forward a collection of mechanisms named
   "Suspenders".  "Suspenders" are designed to address the adverse
   effects on INR holders which were caused by CAs' accidental or
   deliberate misbehavior.  This mechanism imports two new objects: an
   INRD (Internet Number Resource Declaration) file and a LOCK object.
   The INRD file is external to the RPKI repository, and it contains the
   most recent changes that were made by the INR holder.  The LOCK
   object is published in the INR holder's repository.  It contains a

   URL which points to the INRD file, and a public key used to verify
   the signature of INRD file.  Whenever the RPs detect the
   inconsistencies between the actual changes and the INRD file, they
   can determine individually whether to accept these changes or not.

   Both "Consent" solution and "Suspenders" solution are considered to
   be effective to protect RPKI against misconfigurations and malicious
   actions by authorities who abuse their power.

4.1.3.  Solutions to Global Inconsistency

   The mechanism provided by Heilman et al. is also effective to protect
   RPs against mirror world attacks.  It allows RPs to raise an alarm
   whenever they found their views of RPKI repositories inconsistent
   with the others'.

   Hristo Stoyanov also provides a mechanism to resolve the problem of
   global inconsistency.  This mechanism constructs a k-connected
   spanning graph, and performs 2-party audits for all edges in the
   graph.  This mechanism manages to ensure that every network device
   shares consistent information about the ownership of IP addresses to
   avoid mirror world attacks.

4.1.4.  Solutions to Data Synchronization

   A number of alternative protocols have been presented to take the
   place of "rsync" protocol due to its shortcomings mentioned above.

   1) RRDP

   T.  Bruijnzeels et al. have proposed an alternative protocol (RRDP,
   RPKI Repository Delta Protocol) for RPs to keep their local caches in
   sync with the repository system [I-D.ietf-sidr-delta-protocol].  This
   new protocol is based on notification, snapshot and delta files.
   When RPs query a repository for updates, they will use delta files
   (and snapshot files as needed) to keep their local caches updated.
   Moreover, RRDP protocol can work with the existing rsync URIs.

   Compared with rsync protocol, RRDP is considered to be effective to
   eliminate a number of consistency related issues, help to reduce the
   load on publication servers, and have higher scalability.

   2) Improved Rsync Protocol

   CNNIC also proposed an improved rsync mechanism which transfers the
   work of checksums calculation to RPs in order to reduce the
   computation load on the rsync server side.  The mechanism also

   offered a NOTIFY method that send NOTIFY message to make some key RPs
   to actively fetch the updated RPKI objects in time.

4.1.5.  Solutions to Incomplete Deployment and Low Validation Accuracy

   Both of the two problems (incomplete deployment and low validation
   accuracy) are caused by the partial deployment of RPKI.  With the
   widely deployment of RPKI in the near future, these two problems
   ought to be mitigated.

4.2.  Strategy to Resolve Economic Problems

   Since what ISPs care about most is profit instead of security, it is
   essential to make ISPs aware of the economic interests behind the
   deployment.  RPKI is the base of BGPsec
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-bgpsec-protocol] which can affect the route selection,
   and routers in a more secure AS which deployed with RPKI and BGPsec
   deserve a higher priority.  With this strategy, an ISP who has
   deployed RPKI and BGPsec can attract more traffic, and then more
   revenue.

   In terms of RPKI-capable border routers, a lot of network equipment
   manufacturers including Cisco, Juniper and Alcatel Lucent have put
   RPKI as an important feature in their new products.  And this fact
   could motivate more network equipment manufacturers to provide
   support for RPKI in order to keep pace with these pioneers.

4.3.  Solutions to Mitigate Political Problems

   Obviously, the "power imbalance" is both a technical and political
   problem.  As mentioned in section 4.1.2, "Consent" mechanism and
   "Suspenders" mechanism are presented to address the unilateral
   resource revocation problem.  And both of the two mechanisms have
   taken the political problems (such as government mandate and law
   enforcement actions) into consideration.  So we think that the two
   mechanisms would be effective to mitigate the power imbalance
   problem.
