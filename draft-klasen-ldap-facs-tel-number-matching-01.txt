Abstract

   Based on changes to the 4th edition of X.500, this document updates
   the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). It defines an
   equality and a substrings matching rule for the 'Facsimile Telephone
   Number' syntax and updates the 'facsimileTelephoneNumber' attribute
   type to use them.

Conventions used in this document

   Schema definitions are provided using LDAP description formats
   [RFC2252]. Definitions provided here are formatted (line wrapped) for
   readability.

1. Introduction

   The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) [RFC3377] is based
   on the 2nd edition of X.500 [ITU.X500.1993]. This edition of X.500
   did not define any matching rules for the 'Facsimile Telephone
   Number' syntax. This omission was corrected by Technical Corrigendum
   1 [ITU.X520.2001.TC.1] to the 4th edition of X.520 [ITU.X520.2001].

   This document updates LDAP accordingly. It defines the
   'facsimileNumberMatch' and 'facsimileNumberSubstringsMatch' matching
   rules and replaces section 5.24 of [RFC2256] by redefining the
   'facsimileTelephoneNumber' attribute type to use them.

2. Schema Elements for Facsimile Telephone Numbers

2.1 'Facsimile Telephone Number' Syntax

   The 'FacsimileTelephoneNumber' ASN.1 type [ITU.X520.2001] specifies a
   telephone number for a facsimile terminal and optionally its
   parameters:

   FacsimileTelephoneNumber ::=  SEQUENCE {
   	telephoneNumber  TelephoneNumber,
   	parameters       G3FacsimileNonBasicParameters  OPTIONAL }

   TelephoneNumber  ::=  PrintableString (SIZE(1..ub-telephone-number))
   		-- String complying with ITU-T Rec. E.123 only

   The LDAP Syntax ('Facsimile Telephone Number' ) for this ASN.1 type
   is defined in [RFC2252].  Its LDAP specific string representation is
   given in by the following BNF:

   fax-number    = printablestring [ "$" faxparameters ]

   faxparameters = faxparm / ( faxparm "$" faxparameters )

   faxparm = "twoDimensional" / "fineResolution" /
             "unlimitedLength" /
             "b4Length" / "a3Width" / "b4Width" / "uncompressed"

   In the above, the printablestring is the 'telephoneNumber' and the
   faxparm tokens represent the fax 'parameters'.

   The matching rules defined in the following sections only act upon
   the 'telephoneNumber' component. So any characters in an attribute
   value which occur after the first '$' (and including the first '$')
   are ignored when matching.

2.2 'facsimileNumberMatch' Matching Rule

   The 'facsimileNumberMatch' rule compares an assertion value of the
   'Telephone Number' syntax to the 'telephoneNumber' component of an
   attribute value of the 'Facsimile Telephone Number' syntax. The
   corresponding ASN.1 type of this component is a PrintableString
   representing a telephone number.

   The rule evaluates to TRUE if and only if the 'telephoneNumber'
   component of the attribute value and the assertion value have the
   same number of characters and corresponding characters are the same,
   ignoring the case of letters, and ignoring space and `-' characters.

   The LDAP definition for the 'facsimileNumberMatch' matching rule is:

   ( 2.5.13.63 NAME 'facsimileNumberMatch'
   	SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.50 )

   The 'facsimileNumberMatch' rule is an equality matching rule. The OID
   1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.50 refers to the 'Telephone Number' syntax
   [RFC2252].

2.3 'facsimileNumberSubstringsMatch' Matching Rule

   The 'facsimileNumberSubstringsMatch' rule compares an assertion value
   of the 'Substring Assertion' syntax to the first component of an
   attribute value of the 'Facsimile Telephone Number' syntax. The
   corresponding ASN.1 type of this component is a PrintableString
   representing a telephone number.

   The rule evaluates to TRUE if and only if the substrings of the
   assertion value match disjoint portions of the 'telephoneNumber'
   component of the attribute value in the order of the substrings in
   the assertion value, and an <initial> substring, if present, matches
   the beginning of the attribute value,  and a <final> substring, if
   present, matches the end of the attribute value.  A substring matches
   a portion of the attribute value if corresponding characters are the
   same, ignoring the case of letters, and ignoring space and `-'
   characters.

   The LDAP definition for the 'facsimileNumberSubstringsMatch' matching
   rule is:

   ( 2.5.13.64 NAME 'facsimileNumberSubstringsMatch'
   	SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.58 )

   The 'facsimileNumberSubstringsMatch' rule is a substrings matching
   rule. The OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.58 refers to the 'Substring
   Assertion' syntax [RFC2252].

2.4 'facsimileTelephoneNumber' Attribute Type

   A value of this attribute type is a telephone number for a facsimile
   terminal and optionally its parameters.

   ( 2.5.4.23 NAME 'facsimileTelephoneNumber'
   	EQUALITY facsimileNumberMatch
   	SUBSTR facsimileNumberSubstringsMatch
   	SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.22 )

   The OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.22 refers to the Facsimile
   Telephone Number Syntax [RFC2252].

3. IANA Considerations

   This document make no OID assignments, it only associates LDAP schema
   descriptions with existing elements of X.500 schema.

   It is requested that the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)
   update the LDAP descriptors registry as indicated in the following
   templates:

Appendix A. Examples

   Take as example the following entry:

   dn: o=avinci,c=de
   objectclass: organization
   o: avinci
   facsimileTelephoneNumber: +49 2102 124 555 $fineResolution$a3Width

   Now, searching for
   (facsimileTelephoneNumber=+49-2102-124-555)

   would match this entry, as
   o  only the telephoneNumber component, ie. '+49 2102 124 555 ' of the
      attribute value is taken into account
   o  and the assertion value '+49-2102-124-555' matches '+49 2102 124
      555 ' according to the telephone number matching rule, ie.
      ignoring the case of letters, and ignoring space and '-'
      characters.

   Likewise, the entry specified above would be matched by the following
   filter which uses the substring matching rule:
   (facsimileTelephoneNumber=*-555)

Appendix B. Change Log

B.1 Changes from -00

   o  Added section reiterating the Facsimile Telephone Number syntax.
   o  Corrected OIDs for assertion syntaxes in definition of matching
      rules.
   o  Added examples.
   o  Various editorial updates.
