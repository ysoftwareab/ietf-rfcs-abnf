               Adaptive Subscription to YANG Notification
              draft-wang-netconf-adaptive-subscription-02

Abstract

   This document defines a YANG data model and associated mechanism
   enabling subscriber's adaptive subscriptions to a publisher's event
   streams with various different period intervals to report updates.
   Applying these elements allows both subscriber and publisher to
   automatically adjust the volume of telemetry traffic sent from
   publisher to the receivers.

1.  Introduction

   YANG-Push subscriptions [RFC8641] allow client applications to
   subscribe to continuous datastore updates without needing to poll.
   It defines a mechanism (i.e.,update trigger) to determine when an
   update record needs to be generated.  Two type of subscriptions are
   introduced in [RFC8641], distinguished by how updates are triggered:
   periodic and on-change.

   o  Periodic subscription allows subscribed data to be streamed to the
      destination at a configured fixed periodic interval






Wu, et al.               Expires April 17, 2021                 [Page 2]

Internet-Draft            Adaptive Subscription             October 2020


   o  On-change subscription allows update to be triggered whenever a
      change in the subscribed information is detected.  The periodic
      interval is set to zero value in the on-change subscription case.

   However in some large scale deployments (e.g., wireless network
   performance monitoring) where an increased data collection rate is
   being used, it becomes more likely that a burst of streamed data may
   temporarily overwhelm a receiver and consume expensive network
   resource (e.g., air interface resource).  If the rate at which we can
   collect a stream of data is set too low, these telemetry data are not
   sufficient to detect and diagnose problems and verify correct network
   behavior.  There is a need for a service to configure both collectors
   and publishers with multiple different period intervals and
   automatically switch to different period intervals according to
   resource usage change, e.g., when the wireless signal strength falls
   below a configured low watermark, the subscribed data can be streamed
   at a higher rate while when the wireless signal strength crosses a
   configured high watermark, the subscribed data can be streamed at
   lower rate.

   This document defines a YANG data model and associated mechanism
   enabling subscriber's adaptive subscriptions to a publisher's event
   streams.  Applying these elements allows both subscriber and
   publisher to automatically adjust the volume of telemetry traffic
   sent from publisher to the receivers.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document uses the following terms:

   Event:  An event is something that happens that may be of interest -
      a configuration change, a fault, a change in status, crossing a
      threshold, or an external input to the system, for example.
      Often, this results in an asynchronous message, sometimes referred
      to as a notification or event notification, being sent to
      interested parties to notify them that this event has occurred
      [RFC5277].

   Client:  Defined in [RFC8342].

   Configuration:   Defined in [RFC8342].

   Configured subscription:  Defined in [RFC8639]

   Configuration datastore:    Defined in [RFC8342].

   Notification message:   Information intended for a receiver
      indicating that one or more events have occurred [RFC8639].

   Publisher:  An entity responsible for streaming notification messages
      per the terms of a subscription [RFC8639].

   Receiver:  A target to which a publisher pushes subscribed event
      records.  For dynamic subscriptions, the receiver and subscriber
      are the same entity [RFC8639].

   Subscriber:   A client able to request and negotiate a contract for
      the generation and push of event records from a publisher.  For
      dynamic subscriptions, the receiver and subscriber are the same
      entity [RFC8639].

   Subscription:  A contract with a publisher, stipulating the
      information that one or more receivers wish to have pushed from
      the publisher without the need for further solicitation [RFC8639].

   On-change subscription:  A datastore subscription with updates that
      are triggered when changes in subscribed datastore nodes are
      detected.

   Periodic subscription:  A datastore subscription with updates that
      are triggered periodically according to some time interval.

2.  Model Overview

   This document defines a YANG module "ietf-adaptive-subscription",
   which augments the "update-trigger" choice defined in the "ietf-yang-
   push" module [RFC8641] with subscription configuration parameters
   that are specific to adaptive subscription.

   In addition to Subscription state notifications defined in [RFC8639]
   and Notifications for Subscribed Content defined in [RFC8641], "ietf-
   adaptive-subscription" YANG module also defines "adaptive-update"
   notification to report update interval change.

   The following tree diagrams [RFC8340] provide an overview of the data
   model for "ietf-adaptive-subscription.yang" module.

2.1.  Subscription Configuration

   For adaptive subscriptions, triggered updates will occur at the
   boundaries of specified time intervals when a trigger condition is
   satisfied.  These boundaries can be calculated from the adaptive
   periodic parameters:

   o  a "period" that defines the new duration between push updates, the
      period can be changed based on trigger condition.

   o  an "anchor-time" update intervals fall on the points in time that
      are a multiple of a "period" from an "anchor-time".  If an

Internet-Draft            Adaptive Subscription             October 2020


      "anchor-time" is not provided, then the "anchor-time" MUST be set
      with the creation time of the initial update record.

   o  a "watermark" that defines the threshold value of the targeted
      data object, e.g., it can be lower boundary or upper boundary of
      targeted data object.

   o  a "xpath-external-eval" represents an Evaluation criteria that may
      be applied against event records in an event stream, which is used
      to trigger update interval switch.  It contains comparisons of
      datastore node with specific threshold (i.e., watermark) and
      associated logical operations in the XPath format.  Different from
      stream-xpath-filter defined in [RFC8639], it doesn't influence the
      event records output generation from a publisher.

2.2.  YANG RPC

2.2.1.  "establish-subscription" RPC

   The augmentation of YANG module ietf-yang-push made to RPCs specified
   in YANG module ietf-subscribed-notifications [RFC8639] is introduced.
   This augmentation concerns the "establish- subscription" RPC, which
   is augmented with parameters that are needed to specify adaptive
   subscriptions.  These parameters are same as one defined in
   Section 2.1.

2.2.2.  "modify-subscription" RPC

   The subscriber MAY invoke the "modify-subscription" RPC for a
   subscription it previously established.  The subscriber will include
   newly desired values in the "modify-subscription" RPC.  Parameters
   not included MUST remain unmodified.  Section 4.4.2 of [RFC8641]
   provides an example where a subscriber attempts to modify the period
   and datastore XPath filter of a subscription using NETCONF.  The
   period can be the 'period' parameter defined by ietf-adaptive-
   subscription.

2.3.  Notifications for Adaptive Subscribed Content

   The adaptive update notification is similar to Subscription state
   change notifications defined in [RFC8639].  It is inserted into the
   sequence of notification messages sent to a particular receiver.  The
   adaptive update notification cannot be dropped or filtered out, it
   cannot be stored in replay buffers, and it is delivered only to
   impacted receivers of a subscription.  The identification of adaptive
   update notification is easy to separate from other notification
   messages through the use of the YANG extension "subscription-state-

Internet-Draft            Adaptive Subscription             October 2020


   notif".  This extension tags a notification as a subscription state
   change notification.

   The objects in the 'adpative-update' notification include:

   o  a "period" that defines the duration between push updates, the
      period can be changed based on trigger condition.

   o  an "anchor-time"; update intervals fall on the points in time that
      are a multiple of a "period" from an "anchor-time".  If an
      "anchor-time" is not provided, then the "anchor-time" MUST be set
      with the creation time of the initial update record.

   o  A selection filter identifying YANG nodes of interest in a
      datastore.  Filter contents are specified via a reference to an
      existing filter or via an in-line definition for only that
      subscription.  Referenced filters allow an implementation to avoid
      evaluating filter acceptability during a dynamic subscription
      request.  The "case" statement differentiates the options.  Note
      that filter contents are not affected by "xpath-external-eval"
      parameter and "watermark" parameter defined by update trigger.

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  Updates to the IETF XML Registry

   This document registers two URIs in the IETF XML registry [RFC3688].
   Following the format in [RFC3688], the following registrations are
   requested to be made:

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-adaptive-subscription
      Registrant Contact: The IESG.
      XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

4.2.  Updates to the YANG Module Names Registry

   This document registers two YANG modules in the YANG Module Names
   registry [RFC7950]. . Following the format in [RFC6020], the
   following registration has been made:

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
      Name:         ietf-adaptive-subscription
      Namespace:    urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-adaptive-subscription
      Prefix:       as
      Reference:    RFC xxxx
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

5.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The NETCONF Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive in some
   network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config) to these
   data nodes without proper protection can have a negative effect on

   network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

Appendix B.  Adaptive Subscription and Notification Example

   The examples within this document use the normative YANG module
   "ietf-adaptive-subscription" as defined in Section 3 and the non-
   normative example YANG module "example-wifi-mac" as defined in
   Appendix A.1.

   This section shows some typical adaptive subscription and
   notification message exchanges.

B.1.  "edit-config" Example

   The client configure adaptive subscription parameters on the server.
   The adaptive subscription configuration parameters require the server
   to scan all clients every 5 seconds if the ssid value of client is
   greater than -65dB; If the ssid value of client is less than -65dB,
   switch to 60 seconds period value, and then scan all clients every 60
   seconds.

B.2.  Create Adaptive Subscription Example

   The subscriber sends an "establish-subscription" RPC with the
   parameters listed in to request the creation of a adaptive
   subscription.  The adaptive subscription configuration parameters
   require the server to scan all clients every 5 seconds if the ssid
   value of client is greater than -65dB; If the ssid value of client is
   less than -65dB, switch to 60 seconds period value, and then scan all
   clients every 60 seconds.  (Section 2)

   In another example, the adaptive subscription configuration
   parameters could also require the server to scan all clients every 5
   seconds if the difference between maximum value of client ssid and
   minimum value of client ssid is greater than 0.20dB; If the
   difference between maximum value of client ssid and minimum value of
   client ssid is less than 20dB, switch to 60 seconds period value and
   then scan all clients every 60 seconds.

B.3.  "adaptive-update" notification example

   Upon the server switches to from the update interval 5 seconds to the
   new update interval 60 seconds, Before sending event records to
   receivers, the "adaptive-update" notification should be generated and
   sent to the receivers to inform the receivers that the update
   interval value is switched to the new value.
