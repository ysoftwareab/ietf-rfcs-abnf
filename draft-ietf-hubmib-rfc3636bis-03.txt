Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it defines objects for managing IEEE 802.3 Medium
   Attachment Units (MAUs).  This memo obsoletes RFC 3636.  It amends
   that specification by moving MAU type OBJECT-IDENTITY definitions and
   relevant textual conventions into a separate Internet Assigned Number
   Authority (IANA) maintained MIB module.  In addition, management
   information is added to enable support for Ethernet in the First Mile

Internet-Draft                   MAU MIB                       June 2006


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it defines objects for managing IEEE 802.3 Medium
   Attachment Units (MAUs).

   The previous version of this memo, RFC 3636 [RFC3636], defined a
   single MIB module.  This memo splits the original MIB module into
   two, putting frequently updated object identities and textual
   conventions into a separate, IANA-maintained MIB module, in order to
   decrease re-issues of the basic MIB module.

   The first version of the IANA-maintained MIB module also extends the
   list of managed objects to support Ethernet in the First Mile (EFM)
   and 10GBASE-CX4 interfaces.

   Ethernet technology, as defined by the 802.3 Working Group of the
   IEEE, continues to evolve, with scalable increases in speed, new
   types of cabling and interfaces, and new features.  This evolution
   may require changes in the managed objects in order to reflect this
   new functionality.  This document, as with other documents issued by
   this working group, reflects a certain stage in the evolution of
   Ethernet technology.  In the future, this document might be revised,
   or new documents might be issued by the Ethernet Interfaces and Hub
   MIB Working Group, in order to reflect the evolution of Ethernet
   technology.


2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft                   MAU MIB                       June 2006


3.  Overview

   Instances of these object types represent attributes of an IEEE 802.3
   MAU.  Several types of MAUs are defined in the IEEE 802.3 CSMA/CD
   standard [IEEE802.3].  These MAUs may be connected to IEEE 802.3
   repeaters or to 802.3 (Ethernet-like) interfaces.  For convenience
   this document refers to these devices as "repeater MAUs" and
   "interface MAUs."

   The definitions presented here are based on Section 30.5, "Layer
   Management for 10 Mb/s, 100 Mb/s, 1000 Mb/s and 10 Gb/s Medium
   Attachment Units (MAUs)", Section 30.6, "Management for link Auto-
   Negotiation", and Annex 30A, "GDMO Specifications for 802.3 managed
   object classes" of IEEE Std. 802.3, 2002 edition [IEEE802.3], as
   amended by IEEE Std. 802.3ae-2002 [IEEE802.3ae], IEEE Std. 802.3ah-
   2004 [IEEE802.3ah] and IEEE Std. 802.3ak-2004 [IEEE802.3ak].  This
   specification is intended to provide for management of all types of
   Ethernet/802.3 MAUs.

3.1.  Relationship to RFC 3636

   The management definitions provided in this memo are intended to be a
   superset of those defined by RFC 3636 [RFC3636].

   In order to decrease re-issues of this document due to the new MAU
   type, Media Available state, Auto Negotiation capability and/or Jack
   type introduction, all relevant object identities and textual
   conventions have been moved to a separate, IANA-maintained MIB module
   IANA-MAU-MIB, the first version of which is defined in this memo.
   Thus when a new MAU type, Media Available state, Auto Negotiation
   capability and/or Jack type is defined by the IEEE 802.3 working
   group, only the IANA-maintained module needs to be revised, leaving
   the basic MAU-MIB module defined in this memo unchanged.

   In addition, the new definitions are added to the IANA-maintained MIB
   module, to support Ethernet in the First Mile (EFM) and 10GBASE-CX4
   interfaces, defined in IEEE Std 802.3ah-2004 [IEEE802.3ah] and IEEE
   Std 802.3ak-2004 [IEEE802.3ak] respectively.

   It should be noted that the changes made in this revision will not be
   entirely backward-compatible with MIB modules that currently import
   MAU type object identity descriptors from the MAU-MIB; such modules
   will need to be revised to import those DESCRIPTORS from the IANA-
   MAU-MIB.  Similarly, any management applications that process the
   object identity definitions (e.g., to present the DESCRIPTION text to
   a user) will need to be get those definitions from the IANA-MAU-MIB
   instead of the MAU-MIB.  While it is true that changes that require
   such adjustments are not strictly compliant with the SMIv2 rules

   governing MIB module revisions (see [RFC2578] Section 10), in this
   case continued high maintenance costs that would result from not
   making these changes make the deviation from the rules justified.  It
   should be noted that the working group was not able to find any
   examples of MIB modules or management applications that would
   actually be negatively affected by the changes.

3.2.  Relationship to RFC 2668

   RFC 3636 was a replacement for RFC 2668 [RFC2668].  RFC 3636 included
   all of the objects contained in RFC 2668, plus new and updated
   definitions to provide management support for 10 Gb/s devices.

3.3.  Relationship to RFC 2239

   RFC 2668 was a replacement for RFC 2239 [RFC2239].  RFC 2668 defined
   a superset of that defined by RFC 2239, which contained all of the
   objects defined in RFC 2239, plus several new ones which provide
   additional capabilities.  The new objects provided management support
   for:

   o  management of 1000 Mb/s devices

   o  management of PAUSE negotiation

   o  management of remote fault status

3.4.  Relationship to RFC 1515

   RFC 2239 was a replacement for RFC 1515 [RFC1515].  RFC 2239 defined
   a superset of RFC 1515 which contained all of the objects defined in
   RFC 1515, plus several new ones which provided additional
   capabilities.  The new objects in RFC 2239 provided management
   support for:

   o  management of 100 Mb/s devices

   o  auto-negotiation on interface MAUs

   o  jack management

3.5.  Relationship to other MIBs

   It is assumed that an agent implementing this MIB will also implement
   (at least) the 'system' group defined in the SNMPv2 MIB [RFC3418].
   The following sections identify other MIBs that such an agent should
   implement.

Internet-Draft                   MAU MIB                       June 2006


3.5.1.  Relationship to the Interfaces MIB

   The sections of this document that define interface MAU-related
   objects specify an extension to the Interfaces MIB [RFC2863].  An
   agent implementing these interface-MAU related objects MUST also
   implement the relevant groups of the ifCompliance3 MODULE-COMPLIANCE
   statement of the Interface MIB.  The value of the object ifMauIfIndex
   is the same as the value of 'ifIndex' used to instantiate the
   interface to which the given MAU is connected.

   It is REQUIRED that an agent implementing the interface-MAU related
   objects in this MIB will also fully comply with the dot3Compliance2
   MODULE-COMPLIANCE statement of the Ethernet-like Interfaces MIB,
   [RFC3635].  Furthermore, when the interface-MAU related objects are
   used to manage a 10GBASE-W PHY -- i.e., when ifMauType is equal to
   dot3MauType10GigBaseW or any other 10GBASE-W variant -- then the
   agent MUST also support the Ethernet WAN Interface Sublayer (WIS) MIB
   [RFC3637] and must follow the interface layering model specified
   therein.  In that case the value of the object ifMauIfIndex is the
   same as the value of 'ifIndex' for the layer at the top of the stack,
   i.e., for the ifTable entry that has 'ifType' equal to
   ethernetCsmacd(6).  If the interface-MAU related objects are used to
   manage a PHY that allows the MAU type to be changed dynamically, then
   the agent SHALL create ifTable, ifStackTable, and ifInvStackTable
   entries that pertain to the WIS when ifMauDefaultType is changed to a
   10GBASEW variant (i.e., one of dot3MauType10GigBaseW,
   dot3MauType10GigBaseEW, dot3MauType10GigBaseLW, or
   dot3MauType10GigBaseSW) from any other type, and shall destroy the
   WIS-related entries when ifMauDefaultType is changed to a non-
   10GBASE-W type.  The agent SHALL also change the values of
   'ifConnectorPresent' and 'ifHighSpeed' in the ifTable entry indexed
   by ifMauIfIndex as specified in [RFC3635] and [RFC3637] when
   ifMauDefaultType is manipulated in this way but SHALL NOT otherwise
   alter that entry.

   (Note that repeater ports are not represented as interfaces in the
   Interface MIB.)

3.5.2.  Relationship to the 802.3 Repeater MIB module

   The section of this document that defines repeater MAU-related
   objects specifies an extension to the 802.3 Repeater MIB defined in
   [RFC2108].  An agent implementing these repeater-MAU related objects
   MUST also comply with the snmpRptrModCompl compliance statement of
   the 802.3 Repeater MIB module.

   The values of 'rpMauGroupIndex' and 'rpMauPortIndex' used to
   instantiate a repeater MAU variable SHALL be the same as the values

Internet-Draft                   MAU MIB                       June 2006


   of 'rptrPortGroupIndex' and 'rptrPortIndex' used to instantiate the
   port to which the given MAU is connected.

3.6.  Management of Internal MAUs

   In some situations, a MAU can be "internal" -- i.e., its
   functionality is implemented entirely within a device.  For example,
   a managed repeater may contain an internal repeater-MAU and/or an
   internal interface-MAU through which management communications
   originating on one of the repeater's external ports pass in order to
   reach the management agent associated with the repeater.  Such
   internal MAUs may or may not be managed.  If they are managed,
   objects describing their attributes should appear in the appropriate
   MIB subtree: dot3RpMauBasicGroup for internal repeater-MAUs and
   dot3IfMauBasicGroup for internal interface-MAUs.

3.8.  Addition of new MAU Types

3.8.1.  dot3MauType OBJECT-IDENTITIES

   The dot3MauType OBJECT IDENTIFIER and its OBJECT-IDENTITY definitions
   has been moved from the MAU-MIB into the IANA-maintained IANA-MAU-
   MIB, first version of which is defined in this memo.

   When a new IEEE 802.3 MAU is defined, IANA can re-issue a version of
   IANA-MAU-MIB with the new dot3MauType OBJECT-IDENTITY and its
   matching IANAifMauTypeListBits textual convention value and,
   possibly, with new IANAifMauMediaAvailable, IANAifMauAutoNegCapBits

   and/or IANAifJackType values.

   An Expert Review, as defined in RFC 2434 [RFC2434], is REQUIRED for
   the addition of the new MAU, Media Available states, Auto Negotiation
   capabilities and/or Jack types.

   In some cases new MAU types may require additional managed objects or
   may have side effects on the behavior of existing managed objects.
   In such cases a standards-track specification (which may be a new
   document or a revision of this document) is also REQUIRED.  Any such
   document is REQUIRED to note any special properties of the MAU types
   that it defines - for example, side effects on the ifStackTable as
   noted in this document for 10GBASE-W MAUs.

3.8.2.  IANAifMauTypeListBits Textual Convention

   The syntax of ifMauTypeListBits is changed to be a textual
   convention, such that the enumerated integer values are now defined
   in the textual convention, IANAifMauTypeListBits, which can be re-
   specified (with additional values, when defined by IEEE 802.3) in the
   IANA-maintained MIB module, without issuing a new version of this
   document.

3.8.3.  IANAifMauMediaAvailable Textual Convention

   The syntax of ifMauMediaAvailable and rpMauMediaAvailable is changed
   a textual convention, such that the enumerated integer values are now
   defined in the textual convention, IANAifMauMediaAvailable, which can
   be re-specified (with additional values, when defined by IEEE 802.3)
   in the IANA-maintained MIB module, without issuing a new version of
   this document.

3.8.4.  IANAifMauAutoNegCapBits Textual Convention

   The syntax of ifMauAutoNegCapabilityBits,
   ifMauAutoNegCapAdvertisedBits and ifMauAutoNegCapReceivedBits objects
   is changed to be a textual convention, such that the enumerated
   integer values are now defined in the textual convention,
   IANAifMauAutoNegCapBits, which can be re-specified (with additional
   values, when defined by IEEE 802.3) in the IANA-maintained MIB
   module, without issuing a new version of this document.

3.8.5.  JackType Textual Convention

   The JackType Textual Convention has been deprecated in favor of
   IANAifJackType defined in the IANA-maintained MIB module, so the new
   Jack types can be added (when defined by IEEE 802.3) without issuing
   a new version of this document.

                      true state is unknown; for example, when it is
                      being initialized.

                      A MAU in the operational(3) state is fully
                      functional, operates, and passes signals to its
                      attached DTE or repeater port in accordance to
                      its specification.

                      A MAU in standby(4) state forces DI and CI to
                      idle and the media transmitter to idle or fault,
                      if supported.  Standby(4) mode only applies to
                      link type MAUs.  The state of
                      rpMauMediaAvailable is unaffected.

                      A MAU in shutdown(5) state assumes the same
                      condition on DI, CI, and the media transmitter
                      as though it were powered down or not connected.
                      The MAU MAY return other(1) value for the
                      rpMauJabberState and rpMauMediaAvailable objects
                      when it is in this state.  For an AUI, this
                      state will remove power from the AUI.

                      Setting this variable to the value reset(6)
                      resets the MAU in the same manner as a
                      power-off, power-on cycle of at least one-half
                      second would.  The agent is not required to
                      return the value reset (6).

                      Setting this variable to the value
                      operational(3), standby(4), or shutdown(5)
                      causes the MAU to assume the respective state
                      except that setting a mixing-type MAU or an AUI
                      to standby(4) will cause the MAU to enter the
                      shutdown state."

                      A MAU in the operational(3) state is fully
                      functional, operates, and passes signals to its
                      attached DTE or repeater port in accordance to
                      its specification.

                      A MAU in standby(4) state forces DI and CI to
                      idle and the media transmitter to idle or fault,
                      if supported.  Standby(4) mode only applies to
                      link type MAUs.  The state of
                      ifMauMediaAvailable is unaffected.

                      A MAU in shutdown(5) state assumes the same
                      condition on DI, CI, and the media transmitter
                      as though it were powered down or not connected.
                      The MAU MAY return other(1) value for the
                      ifMauJabberState and ifMauMediaAvailable objects
                      when it is in this state.  For an AUI, this
                      state will remove power from the AUI.

                      Setting this variable to the value reset(6)
                      resets the MAU in the same manner as a
                      power-off, power-on cycle of at least one-half
                      second would.  The agent is not required to
                      return the value reset (6).

                      Setting this variable to the value
                      operational(3), standby(4), or shutdown(5)
                      causes the MAU to assume the respective state
                      except that setting a mixing-type MAU or an AUI
                      to standby(4) will cause the MAU to enter the
                      shutdown state."

                      This object has been deprecated in favour of
                      ifMauTypeListBits.

                      A value that uniquely identifies the set of
                      possible IEEE 802.3 types that the MAU could be.
                      The value is a sum which initially takes the
                      value zero.  Then, for each type capability of
                      this MAU, 2 raised to the power noted below is
                      added to the sum. For example, a MAU which has
                      the capability to be only 10BASE-T would have a
                      value of 512 (2**9).  In contrast, a MAU which
                      supports both 10Base-T (full duplex) and
                      100BASE-TX (full duplex) would have a value of
                      ((2**11) + (2**16)) or 67584.

                      force the MAU into the specified operating mode.

                      If auto-negotiation is implemented and enabled
                      for this MAU, the operational type of the MAU
                      is determined by auto-negotiation, and the value

         If the MAU is a 10M b/s link or fiber type (FOIRL, 10BASE-T,
         10BASE-F), then this is equivalent to the link test fail
         state/low light function. For an AUI, 10BASE2, 10BASE5, or
         10BROAD36 MAU, this indicates whether or not loopback is
         detected on the DI circuit. The value of this attribute
         persists between packets for MAU types AUI, 10BASE5, 10BASE2,
         10BROAD36, and 10BASEFP.
         At power-up or following a reset, the Media Available state
         will be unknown(2) for AUI, 10BASE5, 10BASE2, 10BROAD36, and
         10BASE-FP MAUs. For these MAUs loopback will be tested on each
         transmission during which no collision is detected.
         If DI is receiving input when DO returns to IDL after a
         transmission and there has been no collision during the
         transmission, then loopback will be detected. The Media
         Available state will only change during noncollided
         transmissions for AUI, 10BASE2, 10BASE5, 10BROAD36, and
         10BASE-FP MAUs.
         For 100BASE-T2, 100BASE-T4, 100BASE-TX, 100BASE-FX,
         100BASE-LX10 and 100BASE-BX10 PHYs the enumerations match the
         states within the link integrity state diagram. Any MAU that
         implements management of Clause 28 Auto-Negotiation will map
         remote fault indication to remoteFault(5).
         Any MAU that implements management of Clause 37
         Auto-Negotiation will map the received RF1 and RF2 bits as
         follows: Offline maps to offline(10), Link_Failure maps to
         remoteFault(5) and Auto-Negotiation Error maps to
         autoNegError(11).
         The value remoteFault(5) applies to 10BASE-FB remote
         fault indication, the 100BASE-X far-end fault indication and
         nonspecified remote faults from a system running Clause 28
         Auto-Negotiation.
         The value remoteJabber(7), remoteLink loss(8), or remoteTest(9)
         SHOULD be used instead of remoteFault() where the reason for
         remote fault is identified in the remote signaling protocol.
         Where a Clause 22 MII or Clause 35 GMII is present, a logic
         one in the remote fault bit maps to the value remoteFault(5),
         a logic zero in the link status bit maps to the enumeration
         notAvailable(4). The value notAvailable(4) takes precedence
         over remoteFault(5).
         For 2BASE-TL and 10PASS-TS PHYs, the value unknown(2) maps to
         the condition where the PHY is initializing, the value
         ready(20) maps to the condition where at least one PME is
         available and is ready for handshake, the value available(3)
         maps to the condition where, at the PCS, at least one PME is
         operationally linked, the value notAvailable(4) maps to the
         condition where the PCS is not operationally linked, the value
         availableReduced(19) maps to the condition where a link fault
         is detected at the receive direction by one or more PMEs in the

         aggregation group and the enumeration pmdLinkFault(12) maps to
         the condition where a link fault is detected at the receive
         direction by all of the PMA/PMDs in the aggregation group.
         For 10 Gb/s the enumerations map to value of the link_fault
         variable within the Link Fault Signaling state diagram
         as follows: the value OK maps to the value available(3),
         the value Local Fault maps to the value notAvailable(4)
         and the value Remote Fault maps to the value remoteFault().
         The value pmdLinkFault(12), wisFrameLoss(13),
         wisSignalLoss(14), pcsLinkFault(15), excessiveBER(16) or
         dxsLinkFault(17) SHOULD be used instead of the value
         notAvailable(4) where the reason for the Local Fault state can
         be identified through the use of the Clause 45 MDIO Interface.
         Where multiple reasons for the Local Fault state can be
         identified only the highest precedence error SHOULD be
         reported. This precedence in descending order is as follows:
           pxsLinkFault
           pmdLinkFault
           wisFrameLoss
           wisSignalLoss
           pcsLinkFault
           excessiveBER
           dxsLinkFault.
         Where a Clause 45 MDIO interface is present a logic zero in
         the PMA/PMD Receive link status bit ([IEEE Std 802.3ah-2004]
         Section 45.2.1.2.2) maps to the
         value pmdLinkFault(12), a logic one in the LOF status bit
         (Section 45.2.2.10.4) maps to the value wisFrameLoss(13),
         a logic one in the LOS status bit (Section 45.2.2.10.5) maps
         to the value wisSignalLoss, a logic zero in the PCS Receive
         link status bit (Section 45.2.3.2.2) maps to the value
         pcsLinkFault(15), a logic one in the 10GBASE-R PCS Latched
         high BER status bit (Section 45.2.3.12.2) maps to the value
         excessiveBER, a logic zero in the DTE XS receive link status
         bit (Section 45.2.5.2.2) maps to the value dxsLinkFault(17)
         and a logic zero in the PHY XS transmit link status bit
         (Section 45.2.4.2.2) maps to the value pxsLinkFault(18).

6.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write.  Setting these objects can
   have a serious effect on the operation of the network, including:

   o  enabling or disabling a MAU

   o  changing a MAU's default type

   o  enabling, disabling or restarting autonegotiation

   o  modifying the capabilities that a MAU advertizes during
      autonegotiation.

   Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some
   network environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

Internet-Draft                   MAU MIB                       June 2006


   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  In some environments it may
   be undesirable to allow unauthorized parties to access statistics or
   status information about individual links in a network.  It is thus
   important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects
   and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending
   them over the network via SNMP.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is recommended that the implementors consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section
   8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms
   (for authentication and privacy).

   Furthermore, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines first version of the IANA-maintained MIB
   module.  It is intended that each new MAU type, Media Available
   state, Auto Negotiation capability and/or Jack type defined by the
   IEEE 802.3 working group and approved for publication in a revision
   of IEEE Std 802.3 will be added to the IANA-maintaned module.  An
   Expert Review, as defined in RFC 2434 [RFC2434], is REQUIRED.


8.  Acknowledgments

   This document was produced by the IETF Ethernet Interfaces and Hub
   MIB Working Group, whose efforts were greatly advanced by the
   contributions of the following people:

      Dan Romascanu

   This document is based on the Proposed Standard MAU MIB, RFC 3636
   [RFC3636], edited by John Flick of Hewlett-Packard, and produced by
   the Ethernet Interfaces and Hub MIB Working Group.  It extends that
   document by moving the object identities and textual conventions for
   MAU types into a IANA-maintained MIB module.  In addition, support is
   provided for the EFM and 10GBASE-CX4 MAUs as defined in [IEEE802.3ah]
   and [IEEE802.3ak] respectively.

   RFC 3636, in turn, was based on the Proposed Standard MAU MIB, RFC
   2668 [RFC2668], edited by John Flick of Hewlett-Packard and Andrew
   Smith, then of Extreme Networks, and produced by the Ethernet
   Interfaces and Hub MIB Working Group.  It extends that document by
   providing support for 10 Gb/s MAUs as defined in [IEEE802.3ae].

   RFC 2668, in turn, was based on the Proposed Standard MAU MIB, RFC
   2239 [RFC2239], edited by Kathryn de Graaf, then of 3Com, and Dan
   Romascanu, then of Madge Networks, and produced by the Ethernet
   Interfaces and Hub MIB Working Group.  It extended that document by
   providing support for 1000 Mb/sec MAUs as defined in [IEEE802.3].

   RFC 2239, in turn, was based on the Proposed Standard MAU MIB, RFC
   1515 [RFC1515], edited by Donna McMaster, then of SynOptics
   Communications, Keith McCloghrie, then of Hughes LAN Systems, and Sam
   Roberts, then of Farallon Computing, and produced by the Hub MIB
   Working Group.  It extends that document by providing support for 100
   Mb/sec MAUs, full duplex MAUs, and auto-negotiation, as defined in
   [IEEE802.3].
