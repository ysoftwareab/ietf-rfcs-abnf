2.  Abstract

This document defines a new RADIUS accounting Attribute and  new  values
for  the existing Acct-Status-Type Attribute [1] designed to support the
provision of compulsory tunneling in dial-up networks.

3.  Motivation

Many applications of tunneling protocols such as PPTP and  L2TP  involve
dial-up network access.  Some, such as the provision of secure access to
corporate intranets via the Internet,  are  characterized  by  voluntary

INTERNET-DRAFT      RADIUS Accounting Tunnel Support           July 1998

tunneling:  the  tunnel is created at the request of the user for a spe-
cific purpose.  Other applications  involve  compulsory  tunneling:  the
tunnel  is created without any action from the user and without allowing
the user any choice in the matter.  Examples of applications that  might
be  implemented  using  compulsory tunnels are Internet software upgrade
servers, software registration servers and banking services.  These  are
all services which, without compulsory tunneling, would probably be pro-
vided using dedicated networks or  at  least  dedicated  network  access
servers  (NAS),  since  they are characterized by the need to limit user
access to specific hosts.  Given the existence of widespread support for
compulsory tunneling, however, these types of services could be accessed
via any Internet service provider (ISP).  Typically,  ISPs  providing  a
service  want  to collect data regarding that service, for billing, net-
work planning, etc.  The most popular way to collect usage data in dial-
up  networks today is by means of RADIUS  Accounting.  The use of RADIUS
Accounting allows dial-up usage data to be collected at a central  loca-
tion,  rather  than  stored  on  each NAS.  It makes sense to use RADIUS
Accounting to collect usage data regarding compulsory  tunneling,  since
RADIUS  Accounting has been widely implemented and was designed to carry
this type of information.  In order to provide this functionality, a new
RADIUS attribute is needed to aid in the collation of tunnel usage data;
this document defines this attribute.  In addition, several  new  values
for  the  Acct-Status-Type attribute are proposed.  Specific recommenda-
tions for, and examples of, the application of this  attribute  for  the
L2TP  and  PPTP  protocols can be found in draft-ietf-radius-tunnel-imp-
XX.txt.

4.  Specification of Requirements

described in [2].

5.  New Acct-Status-Type Values

      SHOULD also be included in the Accounting-Request packet:

5.2.  Tunnel-Stop

   Value
      10

   Description

      This value MAY be used to mark the  destruction  of  a  tunnel  to
      another  node.   If  this  value is used, the following attributes
      SHOULD also be included in the Accounting-Request packet:

         NAS-IP-Address (4)

5.3.  Tunnel-Reject

   Value
      11

   Description

      This value MAY be used to mark the rejection of the  establishment
      of a tunnel with another node.  If this value is used, the follow-
      ing attributes SHOULD also be included in  the  Accounting-Request
      packet:

         NAS-IP-Address (4)
         Acct-Delay-Time (41)

6.  Attributes

6.1.  Acct-Tunnel-Connection

   Description

      This  Attribute  indicates the identifier assigned to the session.
      It SHOULD be included in Accounting-Request packets which  contain
      Acct-Status-Type  attributes  with values of either Start or Stop.
      This attribute, along with the Tunnel-Client-Endpoint and  Tunnel-
      Server-Endpoint  attributes [3], may be used to provide a means to
      uniquely identify a tunnel session for auditing purposes.

   A summary of the Acct-Tunnel-Connection  Attribute  format  is  shown
   below.  The fields are transmitted from left to right.

   0                   1                   2
   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |    Type     |    Length     |    String ...
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Type

      68 for Acct-Tunnel-Connection

   Length

      >= 3

   String
      The  format  of  the  identifier  represented  by the String field
      depends upon the value of the Tunnel-Type attribute [3].
