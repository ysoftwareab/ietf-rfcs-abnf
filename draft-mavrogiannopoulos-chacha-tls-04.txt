1.  Introduction

   This document describes the use of the ChaCha stream cipher in the
   Transport Layer Security (TLS) version 1.2 [RFC5246] protocol, as
   well as in the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) version 1.2
   [RFC6347], or any later versions.

   ChaCha [CHACHA] is a stream cipher that has been designed for high
   performance in software implementations.  The cipher has compact
   implementation and uses few resources and inexpensive operations that
   makes it suitable for implementation on a wide range of
   architectures.  It has been designed to prevent leakage of
   information through side channel analysis, has a simple and fast key
   setup and provides good overall performance.  It is a variant of
   Salsa20 [SALSA20SPEC] which is one of the selected ciphers in the
   eSTREAM portfolio [ESTREAM].

   Recent attacks [CBC-ATTACK] have indicated problems with CBC-mode
   cipher suites in TLS and DTLS as well as issues with the only
   supported stream cipher (RC4) [RC4-ATTACK].  While the existing AEAD
   (AES-GCM) ciphersuites address some of these issues, concerns about
   the performance and ease of software implementation are sometimes
   raised.

   Therefore, a new stream cipher to replace RC4 and address all the
   previous issues is needed.  It is the purpose of this document to
   describe a secure stream cipher for both TLS and DTLS that is
   comparable to RC4 in speed on a wide range of platforms and can be

   implemented easily without being vulnerable to software side-channel
   attacks.

2.  The ChaCha Cipher

   ChaCha [CHACHA] is a stream cipher developed by D.  J.  Bernstein in
   2008.  It is a refinement of Salsa20 and was used as the core of the
   SHA-3 finalist, BLAKE.

   The variant of ChaCha used in this document is ChaCha with 20 rounds,
   a 96-bit nonce and a 256 bit key, which will be referred to as
   ChaCha20 in the rest of this document.  This is the conservative
   variant (with respect to security) of the ChaCha family and is
   described in [I-D.irtf-cfrg-chacha20-poly1305].

3.  The Poly1305 Authenticator

   Poly1305 [POLY1305] is a Wegman-Carter, one-time authenticator
   designed by D.  J.  Bernstein.  Poly1305 takes a 32-byte, one-time
   key and a message and produces a 16-byte tag that authenticates the
   message such that an attacker has a negligible chance of producing a
   valid tag for an inauthentic message.  It is described in
   [I-D.irtf-cfrg-chacha20-poly1305].

4.  ChaCha20 Cipher Suites

   In the next sections different ciphersuites are defined that utilize
   the ChaCha20 cipher combined with various message authentication
   methods.

   In all cases, the ChaCha20 cipher, as in
   [I-D.irtf-cfrg-chacha20-poly1305], uses a 96-bit nonce.  That nonce
   is updated on the encryption of every TLS record, and is formed as
   follows.

       struct {
           opaque salt[4];
           opaque record_counter[8];
       } ChaChaNonce;

   The salt is generated as part of the handshake process.  It is either
   the client_write_IV (when the client is sending) or the
   server_write_IV (when the server is sending).  The salt length
   (SecurityParameters.fixed_iv_length) is 4 bytes.  The record_counter
   is the 64-bit TLS record sequence number.  In case of DTLS the
   record_counter is formed as the concatenation of the 16-bit epoch
   with the 48-bit sequence number.

   In both TLS and DTLS the ChaChaNonce is implicit and not sent as part
   of the packet.

   The pseudorandom function (PRF) for TLS 1.2 is the TLS PRF with
   SHA-256 as the hash function.

   The RSA, DHE_RSA, ECDHE_RSA, ECDHE_ECDSA, PSK, DHE_PSK, RSA_PSK,
   ECDHE_PSK key exchanges are performed as defined in [RFC5246],
   [RFC4492], and [RFC5489].

4.1.  ChaCha20 Cipher Suites with Poly1305

   The ChaCha20 and Poly1305 primitives are built into an AEAD algorithm
   [RFC5116], AEAD_CHACHA20_POLY1305, described in
   [I-D.irtf-cfrg-chacha20-poly1305].  It takes as input a 256-bit key
   and a 96-bit nonce.

   When used in TLS, the "record_iv_length" is zero and the nonce is set
   to be the ChaChaNonce.  The additional data is seq_num +
   TLSCompressed.type + TLSCompressed.version + TLSCompressed.length,
   where "+" denotes concatenation.

   The following CipherSuites are defined.

     TLS_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305         = {0xTBD, 0xTBD}
     TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305   = {0xTBD, 0xTBD}
     TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305 = {0xTBD, 0xTBD}

     TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305     = {0xTBD, 0xTBD}
     TLS_DHE_PSK_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305     = {0xTBD, 0xTBD}

     TLS_PSK_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305         = {0xTBD, 0xTBD}
     TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305   = {0xTBD, 0xTBD}
     TLS_RSA_PSK_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305     = {0xTBD, 0xTBD}

     TLS_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305         = {0xTBD, 0xTBD}
     TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305   = {0xTBD, 0xTBD}
     TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305 = {0xTBD, 0xTBD}

     TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305     = {0xTBD, 0xTBD}
     TLS_DHE_PSK_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305     = {0xTBD, 0xTBD}

     TLS_PSK_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305         = {0xTBD, 0xTBD}
     TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305   = {0xTBD, 0xTBD}
     TLS_RSA_PSK_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305     = {0xTBD, 0xTBD}

7.  Security Considerations

   ChaCha20 follows the same basic principle as Salsa20, a cipher with
   significant security review [SALSA20-SECURITY][ESTREAM].  At the time
   of writing this document, there are no known significant security
   problems with either cipher, and ChaCha20 is shown to be more
   resistant in certain attacks than Salsa20 [SALSA20-ATTACK].
   Furthermore ChaCha20 was used as the core of the BLAKE hash function,
   a SHA3 finalist, that had received considerable cryptanalytic
   attention [NIST-SHA3].

   Poly1305 is designed to ensure that forged messages are rejected with
   a probability of 1-(n/2^102) for a 16*n byte message, even after
   sending 2^64 legitimate messages.

   The cipher suites described in this document require that a nonce is
   never repeated under the same key.  The design presented ensures that
   by using the TLS sequence number which is unique and does not wrap
   [RFC5246].

   This document should not introduce any other security considerations
   than those that directly follow from the use of the stream cipher
   ChaCha20, the AEAD_CHACHA20_POLY1305 construction, (see also the
   Security Considerations section of
   [I-D.irtf-cfrg-chacha20-poly1305]).
