template-description=
    This defines the directory-agent service type.  This service is
    used by SLPv2 User Agents, who issue service discovery requests
    and by SLPv2 Service Agents, who register their services with
    the Directory Agent.  The SLPv2 Directory Agent caches the service
    information and provides scalability to the SLPv2 protocol.  The
    Directory Agent MAY include attribute information in its DAAdvert
    messages.  User Agents and Service Agents MAY also use attributes
    to select Directory Agents, by issuing SLPv2 Directory Agent
    discovery Service Requests messages which include a search filter.
