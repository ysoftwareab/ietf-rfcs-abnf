1.  Introduction

   Section 5.4 of RFC 4579 [1] describes how to create a conference
   using ad-hoc SIP methods.  The client sends an INVITE request to a
   conference factory URI and receives the actual conference URI, which
   contains the "isfocus" feature tag, in the Contact header field of a
   response - typically a 200 (OK) response.

   This specification extends the above mechanim to allow UAC to be able
   to provide the Conference Server with the initial conference
   information and policy (referred as conference-info below).

   This specification further provides a mechanism for Conference Server
   to distribute the conference-info generated from ad hoc conference
   creation request as the history information to invitees.

   The mechanism defined in this specification can be used either
   standalone or together with other mechanisms, e.g.  URI-List
   conferencing mechanism defined in RFC XXX {URI List Conferencing} [2]

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3]

   This document uses the conferencing terminology defined in RFC 4353
   [9] "conferencing Framework".

3.  Requirements Analysis

   RFC 4579 [1] defines a mechanism to provide the conference server
   with the initial set of participants in a single operation during the
   ad hoc conference creation.  In addition the invoker may want to
   provide simple conference information and policy referred as
   conference-info below, for example the subject and maximum numbers of
   participants, for an ad hoc conference in the same operation.  In ad
   hoc conference scenario they rarely desire to manipulate the
   conference policy, whether before the conference is created or during
   the conference.

   RFC XXX {URI List Conferencing} [2] defines a mechanism for
   Conference Server to provide URI-List history to invitees by
   including a 'recipient-list-history' body which contains the
   manipulated list of invitees.  The same principle could be applied to
   conference-info.  When Conference Server sends INVITE to invitees,
   e.g. triggered by REFER request or URI-List conference creation, the
   Conference Server can provide them with the conference-info as
   history information.  This will help invitees to determine whether to
   join this conference which may fall into their interest.

   In current art when the invitees get an INVITE request with 'isfocus'
   feature tag they may subscribe to the conference event package as
   defined in RFC 4575 [4] and get notification before joining.
   Consider the fact that the main criteria for invitees to determine
   whether to join a conference may be some simple information, e.g.
   subject, it is more efficient and convenient for invitees to get
   information from the incoming INVITE rather than using subscription
   to the Conference Event Package.  This mechanism could be considered
   as complementary to conference event package subscription mechanism.
   Invitees can also use confernce event package subscription mechanism
   to get more detail information.

   The requirements to support invitation with conference-info may be
   summarized as follows:

      REQ 1: The conference mechanism MUST allow the invoker to provide
      the Conference Server with the initial conference information and
      policy in order to create an ad-hoc conference via one operation.

      REQ 2: The conference mechanism MUST allow the Conference Server
      to distribute the conference information and policy to invitees
      contained in the URI-List.

4.  INVITE: Sending conference-info to Conference Server

   RFC 4575 [4] defines a Conference Event Package for tightly coupled
   conferences using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) events
   framework, along with a data format used in notifications for SIP
   specific conferencing.  RFC XXX {XCON Data Model} [5] extends the
   data format to support more call signaling protocols besides SIP and
   cover the functionality defined in the XCON conferencing framework.
   A sub-set of both data formats can be used to represent conference-
   info, e.g. <conference-description> and <maximum-user-count>.

   The conference-info can be included in the body of initial SIP INVITE
   request to create an ad-hoc conference.  Hence it can be included in
   the follow-up SIP INVITE requests so that invitees are aware.

4.1.  Conference-Info Format

   The sub set of data format defined in RFC 4575 [4] and extended in
   RFC XXX {XCON Data Model} [5] can be used to represent the
   conference-info which could be carried in SIP INVITE method.  The
   amount of data MUST be limited to avoid overload of SIP messages.

   The <conference-info> element has three attributes 'entity', 'state'
   and 'version'.  The 'entity' and 'version' attributes MUST be
   included.  The 'state' attribute is MAY be included and the default
   value is "full".

   In this specification, there are some restrictions for attributes of
   <conference-info> element as follow:

   o  'entity': In initial INVITE request from invoker the value MAY be
      any URI and MUST be ignored by Conference Server.  In subsequent
      INVITE requests from Conference Server the value MUST be the
      conference URI that identifies the conference created by the
      Conference Server.  The invitees can subscribe this URI for
      receiving Conference Event Package.

   o  'state': This attribute MAY not be present in all INVITE requests.
      If it is present, it MUST be ignored by the Conference Server and
      invitees.

   o  'version': This attribute MAY contain any version number and MUST
      be ignored by the Conference Server and invitees.

4.2.  UAC Procedures

   A UAC that wants to include the initial conference-info in its
   initial INVITE request MUST add a body whose disposition type is
   'conference-info' as defined in section xxx of this specification.
   Additionally, the UAC MUST include the 'conference-info-invite'
   option-tag, which is registered with the IANA in Section xxx in a
   Require header field.  The UAC sends this INVITE request to the
   conference factory URI.

   A 200 (OK) response means that the conference was created

   successfully, that the UAC that generated the INVITE request is in
   the conference, and that the server understood the conference
   information.

4.2.1.  re-INVITE Request Generation

   The previous section has specified how to include the conference
   information in an initial INVITE request to a conference server.
   Once the INVITE-initiated dialog between the UAC and the Conference
   Server has been established, the UAC can send re-INVITE requests to
   the conference server to, modify the characteristics of the media
   exchanged with the server.

   There are no semantics associated with conference-info bodies in re-
   INVITE requests.  Therefore, UACs MUST NOT include conference-info
   bodies in re-INVITE requests sent to a conference server (although it
   may become useful at some future time and future extentions may
   define them).

4.3.  Conference Server Procedures

   Conference Server that is able to receive and process INVITE requests
   with a 'conference-info' body MUST include a 'conference-info-invite'
   option-tag in a Supported header field when responding to OPTIONS
   requests.

   On reception of an INVITE request containing a 'conference-info' body
   as described in Section 3, a conference server MUST follow the rules
   described in RFC 4579 [1] to create ad-hoc conference.

   If <maximum-user-count> element is present, the Conference Server
   MUST reject the requests to add new participants to the conference
   when the number of participants has reached the number specified in
   this element.  The Conference Server MUST ignore 'state' attribute if
   it is present.  The Conference Server MUST ignore 'version'
   attribute.

   The Conference Server MUST include the same conference-info from
   incoming INVITE request to the invitees as the history information
   using an INVITE-contained conference-info request.  The Conference
   Server MUST NOT add new elements to history information.

   If the Conference Server includes conference-info history in an
   outgoing INVITE request, it MUST include a Content-Disposition header
   field (which is specified in RFC 2183 [6] ) with the value set to
   'conference-info-history' and a 'handling' parameter (as specified in
   RFC 3204 [7] ) set to "optional".

4.3.1.  re-INVITE Request Handling

   There are no semantics associated with conference-info bodies in re-
   INVITE requests.  Therefore, a Conference Server receiving a re-
   INVITE request with a conference-info body and, consequently, a
   'conference-info-invite' option-tag, following standard SIP
   procedures, MUST reject it with a 420 (Bad Extension), which carries
   an Unsupported header field listing the 'conference-info-invite'
   option-tag.

      This is because the resource identified by the conference URI does
      not actually support this extension.  On the other hand, the
      resource identified by the conference factory URI does support
      this extension and, consequently, would include the 'conference-
      info-invite' option-tag in, for example, responses to OPTIONS
      requests.

5.  INVITE: Sending URI-List with conference-info to Conference Server

   The mechanism defined in section 4 of this specification can be used
   together with other mechanisms, e.g.  URI-List conferencing mechanism
   defined in RFC XXX {URI List Conferencing} [2] .  The initial INVITE
   request can carry a 'multipart/mixed' body composed of three bodies:

   o  'application/sdp' body: describes the session;

   o  'application/resource-lists+xml' body: describes the list of
      target URIs;

   o  'application/conference-info+xml' body: contains the conference
      information.

   The UAC and Conference Server MUST follow the procedures defined in
   RFC XXX {URI List Conferencing} [2] and section 4 of this
   specification respectively.  In addition, the UAC MUST ensure the
   number of URIs in the URI-List will not exceed the number specified
   in <maximum-user-count> element when it is present.  A Conference
   Server receiving a INVITE request with a URI-List body and a
   conference-info body where the number of URIs exceed maximum user
   count, consequently, rejects it with a 403 (Forbidden).

6.  Example

6.1.  Creation of Conference with initial conference-info

   Figure 3 shows an example of ad-hoc conference creation with initial
   conference-info.  A UAC sends an INVITE request F1 that contains SDP
   body and conference-info to the Conference Server.  The Conference
   Server answers with a 200 (OK) response.  Then Conference Server is
   requested to add new participant Bob to the specified conference
   using REFER method.  The UAC sends a REFER request F3 to the
   conference URI with a Refer-To containing the URI of Bob. The
   Conference Server sends an INVITE request F7 to Bob containing the
   conference-info history.  Then Bob knows the conference-info of this
   specific conference, such as subject, directly when he receives the
   INVITE request F7 and decides to join it.

6.2.  Creation of a Conference with initial URI-List and conference-info

   Figure 6 shows an example of ad-hoc conference creation with initial
   URI-List and conference-info.  A UAC sends an INVITE request F1 that
   contains initial participants list and conference-info to the
   Conference Server.  The Conference Server answers with a 200 (OK)
   response.  Then Conference Server generates an INVITE request to each
   of the participants identified by the URIs included in the URI-list.

   The Conference Server includes a manipulated URI-list and conference-
   info history in each of the outgoing INVITE requests.

7.  Security Considerations

   SIP Conferencing generally have authorization rules about who can or
   cannot join a conference, what type of media can or cannot be used,
   etc.  This information is used by the focus to admit or deny
   participation in a conference.  It is RECOMMENDED that these types of
   authorization rules be used to provide security for a SIP conference.
   For this authorization information to be used, the focus needs to be
   able to authenticate potential participants.  Normal SIP mechanisms
   including Digest authentication and certificates can be used.  These
   conference specific security requirements are discussed further in
   the requirements and framework documents.

   This specification defines a mechanism to setup ad hoc SIP
   conferences using a INVITE-contained conference-info which may
   contain additional policy for focus to control the conferences.
   Implementations of conference servers MUST follow the policy
   contained in conference-info.

   The mechanism defined in this specification can be used together with
   URI-List Service.  The Framework and Security Considerations for SIP
   URI-List Services (which is documented in RFC XXXX [8] ) discusses
   issues related to SIP URI-list services.  Given that a conference
   server sending INVITE requests to a set of users acts as an URI-list
   service, implementations of conference servers that handle lists MUST
   follow the security-related policy in RFC XXXX [8] .  These rules
   include mandatory authentication and authorization of clients, and
   opt-in lists.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines the 'conference-info-invite' SIP option-tag.
   It should be registered in the Option Tags subregistry under the SIP
   parameter registry.  The following is the description to be used in
   the registration.
