Negotiation of multiple Child Security Association with the Internet Key
                  Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2)
                draft-mglt-ipsecme-multiple-child-sa-00

Abstract

   IPsec packet processing with one Security Association (SA) per core
   is more efficient than having a SA shared by the multiple cores.

   This document optimizes the negotiation of multiple unidirectional
   SAs in order to minimize the impact SAs being shared by multiple
   cores.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and

   as shown here.

2.  Introduction

   IPsec processing (on Linux) is more efficient with SA attached to a
   given core as opposed to a SA shared by multiple cores.  Suppose an
   initiator and a responder respectively with n and p cores establish
   an IPsec protected communication defined by Traffic Selectors (TSi,
   TSr).  IPsec processing performance may be increased if the initiator
   (resp. the responder) processes IPsec packets via n (resp. p)
   distinct unidirectional SAs rather than having a SA shared by the n
   (resp p) cores.

   Optimally the number of SAs is expected to be equal to the number of
   cores which can be different for each peer.  When peers have a
   different number of cores, the number of SA is expected to be equal
   to the highest number of cores to minimize context switching and the
   minimum number of cores to optimize memory space.  In fact, having
   fewer SAs than the number of cores may result in switching the SA
   context to unused cores.  On the other hand, having a greater number
   of SAs results in a core sharing multiple SAs for the same purpose,
   which does not improve performances at the cost of an additional SA
   stored in the kernel.

   Currently Child SA are agreed with IKEv2 [RFC7296] CREATE_CHILD_SA
   exchange.  Additional Child SAs (in our case n or p) would require n

   or p CREATE_CHILD_SA exchanges that add multiple round trips carrying
   similar payloads (TSi, TSr, SA) which is not necessary.

   This document describes the MULTIPLE_CHILD_SA Notify Payload used in
   a CREATE_CHILD_SA to indicate the support of Multiple SA Extension as
   well as to agree on the additional number negotiated SA.

3.  Protocol Exchange

   The support for Multiple Child SA extension as well as the number of
   additional Child SAs is performed during the CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange
   via the MULTIPLE_CHILD_SA Notify Payload.

   The initiator indicates in a single MULTIPLE_CHILD_SA notification,
   the requested additional number of SA (nChildSAi), the maximum number
   of Child SA (maxChildSA) a responder is able to request, and a Nonce
   (SPIi_Nonce), that is used to generate the SPIi associated to the
   SPIi of the Child SAs.  The initiator MUST chose the Nonce value such
   as SPIi associated to maxChildSA remains available.  The associated
   SPIi values are generated as follows:

   {SPIi_1, ..., SPIi_maxChildSA} = prf+(SPIi_Nonce)



    initiator                         responder
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    HDR, SK {IDi, [CERT,] [CERTREQ,]
        [IDr,] AUTH, SAi2, TSi, TSr,
        N(MULTIPLE_CHILD_SA(nChildSAi, maxChildSA, SPIi_Nonce))}  -->

   Upon receiving a request for the CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange, the
   responder builds the CREATE_CHILD_SA Response.  The MULTIPLE_CHILD_SA
   Notify Payload is processed only when the CREATE_CHILD_SA can be
   successfully completed and that the responder supports the Multiple
   Child SA extension.  Otherwise the MULTIPLE_CHILD_SA Notify Payload
   is ignored.  Only the first encountered MULTIPLE_CHILD_SA
   notification is considered, others are ignored.

   Upon receiving the MULTIPLE_CHILD_SA Notify Payload, a responder
   indicates the accepted number of additional SA (nChildSA) it is
   willing to generate. nChildSAr MUST be equal or greater to nChildSAi
   and lower or equal to maxChildSA.  In addition, the responder
   provides a Nonce (SPIr_Nonce) that will be used to generate the
   nChildSAs. maxChildSA is left unchanged.  The responder MUST chose
   Nonce such that the nChildSA SPIs are available.  The SPIs are
   generated as follows:

{SPIr_1, ..., SPIr_nChildSA} = prf+(SPIi_Nonce)

                 <--  HDR, SK {IDr, [CERT,] AUTH,
                          SAr2, TSi, TSr,
                           N(MULTIPLE_CHILD_SA(nChildSA, maxChildSA, SPIr_Nonce))}

   Initiator and responder generate material for ChildSA and nChildSA
   additional Child SAs, e.g KEYMAT, SPIi, SPIr, TSi, TSr.  Note that
   material derived for the Child SA is performed as defined in
   [RFC7296]

   KEYMAT for the Child SA as well as the nChildSAa are generated as
   follows, with Ni, Nr provided in the IKE_AUTH exchange.  Note that
   the generation of KEYMAT remains compatible with [RFC7296] section
   2.17 for the Child SA.

   +-------------------------------------------------------------+-----+
   | {KEYMAT_ChildSA, KEYMAT_1..., KEYMAT_maxChildSA } =         | Nr) |
   | prf+(SK_d, Ni                                               |     |
   +-------------------------------------------------------------+-----+
   +-------------------------------------------------------------+-----+

   SPIs (SPIi_1, SPIi_nChildSA) and (SPIr_1, SPI_nChildSA) associated to
   the nChildSA are generated as follows.  The SPIs of the Child SA are
   SPIi, SPIr provided in the SA2 payload exchanged.

   {SPIi_1, ..., SPIi_nChildSA} = prf+(SPIi_Nonce) {SPIr_1, ...,
   SPIr_nChildSA} = prf+(SPIr_Nonce)

   TSi, TSr have the same value for the Child SA and nChildSA additional
   Child SAs.

4.  Error Handling

   There may be conditions when the responder for some reason is unable
   or unwilling to create additional Child SAs.  This inability may be
   temporary or permanent.

   Temporary inability occurs when the responder doesn't have enough
   resources at the moment to generate Child SAs.  In this case, the
   responder SHOULD reject the request to clone the IKE SA with the
   TEMPORARY_FAILURE notification.

                              <--  HDR, SK {N(TEMPORARY_FAILURE)}

   After receiving this notification, the initiator MAY retry its
   request after waiting some period of time.  See Section 2.25 of
   [RFC7296] for details.

   In some cases, the responder may have restrictions on the number of
   coexisting SAs with one peer.  These restrictions may be either
   implicit (some devices may have enough resources to handle only a few
   SAs) or explicit (provided by some configuration parameter).  If the
   initiator wants more SAs than the responder is able or is configured
   to handle, the responder SHOULD reject the request with the
   NO_ADDITIONAL_SAS notification as defined in [RFC7296].

                              <--  HDR, SK {N(NO_ADDITIONAL_SAS)}

   This condition is considered permanent and the initiator SHOULD NOT
   retry creating Child SAs until some of the existing SAs with the
   responder are deleted.  This condition is considered permanent and
   the initiator SHOULD NOT retry cloning an IKE SA until some of the
   existing SAs with the responder are deleted.

   Figure 1 illustrates the Notify Payload packet format as described in
   Section 3.10 of [RFC7296] used for both the MULTIPLE_CHILD_SA

   o  nChildSA (2 octets): number of set of SAs.  The value set by the
      initiator is nChildSAi and the one set by the responder is
      nChildSAr.

   o  maxChildSA (2 octets): Maximum number of acceptable set of SAs.
      This value is set by the initiator and set to zero by the
      responder.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has allocated two values in the "IKEv2 Notify Message Types -
   Status Types" registry:

      Value    Notify Messages - Status Types
    -----------------------------------------
      TBD1    MULTIPLE_CHILD_SA

7.  Security Consideration

   The protocol defined in this document does not modify IKEv2.
   Security considerations.  Generating multiple SA is equivalent as the
   CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange described in [RFC7296].
