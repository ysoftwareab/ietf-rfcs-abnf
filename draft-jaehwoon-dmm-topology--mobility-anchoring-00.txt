         Topology-based Distributed Mobility Anchoring in PMIPv6
            draft-jaehwoon-dmm-topology--mobility-anchoring-00

Abstract

   This document presents a topology-based distributed mobility
   management (DMM) mechansim in PMIPv6-based network. In this
   mechanism, a different sub-network prefix is assigned to a different
   access router (AR) in PMIPv6-domain. The sub-network prefix and
   corresponding AR address information is stored in the topology
   server. With this mechanism, there is no need to query mobile 
   node (MN)'s localized mobility anchor (LMA) address information
   whenever MN moves from one network to another.

1.  Introduction

   Centralized mobility management protocols such as MIPv6 [1] and
   PMIPv6 [2] have several problems such as single-node failure,
   congestion possibility, scalability and non-optimal routes [3]. One
   method to resolve such problems is to use the distributed mobility
   management (DMM) mechanism to distribute mobile agent function to
   access routers (ARs) [4]. Especially, in PMIPv6-based DMM, when a
   mobile node (MN) moves from one network to another, a new AR should
   know (1) whether the MN firstly enters the PMIPv6 domain and (2) the
   address information of the LMA for the MN when the AR knows that the
   MN moves from another network.
   
   This document presents a topology-based distributed mobility
   management mechanism in PMIMv6 domain. Here, topology server is
   defined to store the topology information containing sub-network
   prefix assigned to different ARs and corresponding AR address
   information. With this mechanism, overhead can be decreased due to
   control message exchange to know the local mobility anchor (LMA) for
   a mobile node (MN) when the MN frequently moves from one network to
   another especially in micro-cell based mobile network environment.

3.  Protocol Operation


   Figure 1 show the message exchange procedure to provide topology-
   based DMM in PMIPv6-based network presented in this document.
   A network prefix "PREF" is allocated to the PMIPv6 domain. However,
   a different sub-network prefix belonging toe the same network prefix
   "PREF" is allocated to a different AR in PMIPv6 domain. For example,
   a sub-network prefix "PREF1" belonging to "PREF" is allocated to AR1
   and a different sub-network prefix "PREF2" belonging to the same
   "PREF" is allocated to AR2. Even though a different sub-network
   prefix is allocated to a different AR, all ARs advertise the same
   network prefix "PREF" throught the interfaces providing PMIPv6
   service.
   
   The sub-network prefix and corresponding AR address mapping
   information is stored in the topology server.

Internet-Draft  Topology-based mobility anchoring in DMM  June 8, 2016


   When an MN firstly enters the PMIPv6 domain and connects to an AR
   (say, AR1), AR1 transmits to the MN a Router Advertisement (RA)
   message by setting "M (Managed address configuration)" flag in
   order to configure an address to the MN by using the stateful address
   configuration method [6]. The network prefix "PREF" is set to the
   prefix option information field in the RA message. The MN having
   received the RA message transmits the dynamic host configuration
   protocol (DHCP) request message to the AR1 [7]. The AR1 considers
   that the MN firstly connects to the PMIPv6 domain and transmits the
   DHCP response message containing an address belonging to the "PREF1"
   to th eMN. The MN sets the address contained in the DHCP response
   message to its interface. After that, the MN can communicate to a
   correspondent node (CN) within the Internet.
   
   When the MN moves from AR1 to AR2 while communicating with a CN, the
   AR1 begins to perform the LMA function for the MN and stores packets
   sent from the CN into the buffer. The AR1 stores the MN's infomation
   into ist Binding Cache Entry (BCE). When the MN connects to AR2, the
   AR2 transmits the RA message containing network prefix set to "PREF"
   to the MN. The MN having received the RA message considers that it
   connects to the same network. It continues to use the address
   configured previously and transmits IP address as usual. AR2 checks 
   the first packet transmitted by the MN. If the first packet contains 
   the DHCP request packet, AR2 considers that the MN firstly connects 
   to the PMIPv6 domain. Otherwise, AR2 considers that the MN moves from 
   another AR area and performs the MAG (Mobility Access Gateway) 
   function for the MN. AR2 checks its topology table in order to know 
   the LMA address for the MN. Sub-network prefix (that is, sub-network 
   address and subnet mask) and corresponding LMA address information is 
   stored in the topology table. If AR2 finds a cache table entry 
   according to the MN, then AR2 establishes the tunnel with the AR1 
   (that is, the LMA for the MN) by exchanging the PBU/PBA message 
   defined in PMIPv6 protocol. Otherwise, AR2 transmits the topology-
   query message including the MN address information to the topology 
   server in order to know the LMA address for the MN. Topology server 
   transmits the topology-response message including sub-network prefix 
   and corresponding AR address information to the AR2. Then AR2 stores 
   the sub-network prefix and AR address information in the topology 
   server and establishes the tunnel with the AR1 by exchanging the 
   PBU/PBA messages.
