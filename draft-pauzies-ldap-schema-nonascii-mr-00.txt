Abstract

   This document provides a collection of matching rules for use with
   the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). Thoses matching
   rules are simple adaptations of existing LDAP matching rules allowing
   a more flexible match on non-ASCII strings.

Internet-Draft      LDAP: Additional Matching Rules           April 2004


1.  Background and Intended Use

   When using thoses rules, non-ASCII characters such as letters with
   accents are converted (when UTF-8 compatibility conversion is
   possible RFC 2044 [RFC2044]) to ASCII characters (same letter without
   accent) before the match.

2.  Matching Rules

2.1  caseIgnoreNonasciiMatch

   The caseIgnoreNonasciiMatch rule compares for equality the asserted
   value with an attribute value of DirectoryString syntax. The rule is
   identical to the caseIgnoreMatch RFC 2252 [RFC2252] rule except that
   non-ASCII characters are matched like their ASCII equivalent.

   ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.10943.10.4.1 NAME 'caseIgnoreNonasciiMatch' SYNTAX
   1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15 )

   The DirectoryString (1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15) syntax is
   described in RFC 2252 [RFC2252].

2.2  caseIgnoreNonasciiOrderingMatch

   The caseIgnoreNonasciiOrderingMatch rule compares the collation order
   of the asserted string with an attribute value of DirectoryString
   syntax. The rule is identical to the caseIgnoreOrderingMatch RFC 2252
   [RFC2252] rule except that non-ASCII characters are matched like
   their ASCII equivalent

   ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.10943.10.4.2 NAME 'caseIgnoreNonasciiOrderingMatch'
   SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15 )

2.3  caseIgnoreNonasciiSubstringMatch

   The caseIgnoreNonasciiSubstringsMatch rule determines whether the
   asserted value(s) are substrings of an attribute value of
   DirectoryString syntax. The rule is identical to the
   caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch RFC 2252 [RFC2252] rule except that
   non-ASCII characters are matched like their ASCII equivalent.

   ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.10943.10.4.3 NAME 'caseIgnoreNonasciiSubstringsMatch'
   SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.58 )

   The SubstringsAssertion (1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.58) syntax is
   described in RFC 2252 [RFC2252].
