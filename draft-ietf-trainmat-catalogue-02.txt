Abstract

    The purpose of this document is to provide a catalogue of quality
    Network Training Materials for use by Internet trainers in
    training their users. By providing such a collection of pointers
    to useful resources, it is hoped that trainers will be relieved
    of much of the load of producing current training materials.

1. Introduction

As the range of information and services on the Internet expands, so
does the potential user population.  Given the significant investment in
the network and the various networked information and data services, it
is essential that the broad spectrum of potential users are made aware
of these services.  In particular they require training in using these
facilities and in making effective use of the tools available for
searching for and retrieving information available on the global
network.

The rapid expansion of the user base has made it difficult for network
trainers to keep up with the demand for training. Librarians, Computing
Service staff and subject-based Network Support staff all have a vital
role to play in training users. Easy access to quality network training
materials and the pooling of resources will help spread the load.

The purpose of this document is to provide a catalogue of quality
Network Training Materials for use by Internet trainers.  By providing
such a collection of pointers to useful resources, it is hoped that
trainers will be relieved of much of the load of producing current
training materials.  The intention is to make this a "living document".
It will be held on-line so that each section may be updated separately
as appropriate.


2. How the information was collected

The information contained in this report was collected over the network
by volunteers from the Trainmat Working Group from the contacts for each
network training resource using the Trainmat template (see Appendix A).
The contents of this template had been discussed by the Trainmat WG at
its meetings and on the mailing list.


3. What is covered?

This catalogue covers network training materials, including
self-teaching materials, and other resources which facilitate and
support training.

[ To be completed once the categories are fixed and ordering of material
  decided ]

4. Updating information

The catalogue is available online, as a possibly more up to date version
of this document and so these versions should be used as the basis for
any updates. The WWW version of the document provides a mechanism,
through a HTML form, to send updates (and new material) to the
maintainers of this catalogue.

To access the document online you may use the World Wide Web at the
University of Adelaide (Australia)

  http://coolabah.itd.adelaide.edu.au/TrainMat/catalogue.html
  http://coolabah.itd.adelaide.edu.au/TrainMat/template.html

Or the following directory on the Network Training Materials gopher
at the University of Newcastle (UK)

  gopher://trainmat.ncl.ac.uk/11/Bibliography/IETF_TERENA/

Updates to the catalogue are welcome and can be made by either
completing a template and sending it to "catalogue@itd.adelaide.edu.au"
or (preferably) by using the HTML form on the World Wide Web
   http://coolabah.itd.adelaide.edu.au/TrainMat/form.html


5. Network Training Materials

This section contains the completed templates of network training
material, as received by the publication date of this document.
The online versions of this document may have more up to date material.
The material falls into the following broad categories:
    Documentation
    Networking Guides
    Resource Guides
    Training Material
    Presentation material
    Workshop exercises
    Self-paced material
[

Appendix B: Notes on completing the TrainMat template

1.      Selecting a new resource for inclusion

When considering a new resource for inclusion in the Trainmat Catalogue,
you will need to ask a few questions to decide whether or not it should
be included.

1.1     Does the item belong in a Training Materials Catalogue?

This catalogue covers network training materials, including self-teaching
materials, and other resources which facilitate and support training.

[The following needs discussion.]

A generous interpretation of what constitutes 'training materials' is
appropriate. Training can be thought of as 'seeking to change
behaviour', and if a document does try to do that, then it can be
considered for inclusion in this catalogue.  A document that leads the
reader through sample exercises comes into this category, but a
reference card listing the commands to use does not, nor does a list of
Internet resources.

1.2      Is the content reasonably up-to-date?

It is intended that the catalogue contains a selection of quality
training materials, not a comprehensive list of everything available.
Some degree of "quality control" is needed on the entries. You will need
to decide whether the item is still relevant and reasonably up-to-date.

1.3     Is it easily available?

Is there an established mechanism for obtaining it? This doesn't mean it
has to be free.


2.      Submitting a new or revised template

The template for inputting new entries to the catalogue is given in
Appendix A. The prefered method of inputting new or updated information
is via a HTML form accessible via the following URL:

        http://coolabah.itd.adelaide.edu.au/TrainMat/form.html

You will need to use a Web browser with forms capability such as Mosaic
version 2, MacWeb, WinWeb, Netscape or Lynx. Input should be quite
straightforward. There are drop-down menus to help with input to some
fields.

Alternatively, completed templates may be emailed to:

        catalogue@itd.adelaide.edu.au

Please note that when you enter a new template you will be listed as the
person responsible for the entry.

Trainmat WG    Catalogue of Network Training Materials                79

The same procedures may be used by the person responsible for an entry,
to update an existing entry.


3.      Notes on completing the various fields of the template

The intention is to keep each entry reasonably short (and definitely not
more than one page in length). Descriptions and other long fields should
therefore be kept to a reasonable length. Note that  fields continued on
the next line should be indented by at least one white space

3.1     Category

"Category"  should be selected from the following set:

[To be defined. Current draft list of categories for discussion include:
