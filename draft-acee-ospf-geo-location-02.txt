   OSPF Extensions for Advertising/Signaling Geo Location Information
                  draft-acee-ospf-geo-location-02.txt

Abstract

   This document specifies an OSPF Router Information (RI) TLV to
   advertise the current Geo Coordinates of the OSPF router.  For Point-
   to-Point (P2P)) and Point-to-Multi-Point (P2MP) networks, the Geo
   Coordinates can be used to dynamically computing the cost to
   neighbors.  This is useful both from the standpoint of auto-
   configuration and situations where the OSPF routers are moving.  The
   Geo Coordinates are also useful for other applications such as
   Traffic Engineering (TE) and network management.

1.  Introduction

   This document specifies an OSPF Router Information (RI) [OSPF-RI] TLV
   to advertise the current Geo Coordinates of the OSPF router.  For
   Point-to-Point (P2P)) and Point-to-Multi-Point (P2MP) networks, the
   Geo Coordinates can be used to dynamically computing the cost to
   neighbors.  This is useful both from the standpoint of auto-
   configuration and situations where the OSPF routers are moving.  The
   Geo Coordinates are also useful for other applications such as
   Traffic Engineering (TE)and network management.

1.1.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-KEYWORDS].

2.  OSPF Geo Coordinates TLV

   The Geo Coordinates TLV can be used to advertise the current location
   of an OSPFv2 [OSPF] or OSPFv3 [OSPFV3] router using the OSPF Router
   Information LSA [OSPF-RI].  The OSPF Router Information LSA can be
   advertised in both link-scoped and area or AS scoped RI LSAs.  The
   value of the Geo Coordinates TLV consists of the following fields:

    0                   1                   2                   3

   Where:

    U-bit: If the U-bit is set, it indicates that the "Location
           Uncertainty" field is specified. If the U-bit is clear,
           it indicates the "Location Uncertainty" field is
           unspecified.

    N-bit: If the N-bit is set, it indicates the Latitude is
           north relative to the Equator. If the N-bit is clear,
           it indicates the Latitude is south of the Equator.

    E-bit: If the E-bit is set, it indicates the Longitude is east
           of the Prime Meridian. If the E-bit is clear, it indicates
           the Longitude is west of the Prime Meridian.

    A-bit: If the A-bit is set, it indicates the "Altitude" field is
           specified. If the A-bit is clear, it indicates the
           "Altitude" field is unspecified.

    M-bit: If the M-bit is set, it indicates the "Altitude" is
           specified in meters. If the M-bit is clear, it indicates
           the "Altitude" is in centimeters.

    Reserved: These bits are reserved.  They SHOULD be set to 0 when
              sending protocol packets and MUST be ignored when
              receiving protocol packets.

    Location Uncertainty: Unsigned 16-bit integer indicating the
                          number of centimeters of uncertainty for
                          the location.

    Latitude Degrees: Unsigned 8-bit integer with a range of 0 - 90
                      degrees north or south of the Equator (northern
                      or southern hemisphere, respectively).

    Longitude Degrees: Unsigned 8-bit integer with a range of 0 - 180
                       degrees east or west of the Prime Meridian.

    Altitude: Signed 32-bit integer containing the Height relative to
              sea level in centimeters or meters.  A negative height
              indicates that the location is below sea level.

                       document.


                         OSPF Geo Coordinates TLV


3.  Link Advertisement of the OSPF Geo-Coordinates

   When the Geo Coordinates are used for cost computation, the
   cooridinates need to be advertised on the link using the encoding
   specified in Section 2.  For this application, a link-scoped OSPF
   Router Information (RI) [OSPF-RI] is advertised on each link where
   geo-location cost computation is utilized.

   When an OSPF router receives the Geo Coordinates TLV in a link-scoped
   OSPF RI LSA from an adjacent neighbor, it can be used to calculate
   the physical distance to neighbor.  For P2P and P2MP networks, this
   distance can be used to dynamically compute the cost of the link to
   that neighbor.  The mapping of the distance to advertised cost is not
   specified in this document.  However, all OSPF routers in the domain
   SHOULD used the same algorithm.  Computation of cost based on
   physical distance can be useful both for autoconfiguration of these
   networks types and dynamic cost computation when the routers are
   moving.

   The Geo location information can be statically provisioned or
   dynamically acquired from a GPS capable device on the OSPF Router.

4.  OSPFv2 Router Information (RI) Opaque LSA

   The OSPF Geo Coordinates TLV may optionally be advertised in the OSPF
   Router Information (RI) LSA [OSPF-RI].  It then may be used for
   applications such as traffic engineering (TE) and network management
   (e.g., the Find-My-Router application).  The details of such
   applications are beyond the scope of this document.

5.  Security Considerations

   Since the Geo Location coordinates provide the exact location of the
   OSPF router, disclosure will make the OSPF router more susceptible to
   physical attacks.  In situations where this is a concern (e.g.,
   military applications), confidentiality should be provided either
   through a secure tunnel (e.g., [IP-ESP]) or protocol encryption
   [OSPFV3-AUTH].

   Additionally, in some situations, the topology of the network is
   considered proprietary information.  With the Geo Location
   coordinates, the physical topology, as well as the IP topology, can
   be discerned from the OSPF Router Information (RI) LSA.  In these
   situations, confidentiality should be assured.

   Security considerations for the base OSPF protocol are covered in
   [OSPF] and [OSPFV3].

6.  Privacy Considerations

   If the location of an OSPF router advertising geo location
   coordinates as described herein can be directly correlated to an
   individual, individuals, or an organization, the location of that
   router should be considered sensitive and OSPF RI LSAs containing
   such geo coordinates should be advertised confidentially as described
   in Section 5.  Additionally, OSPF network management facilities may
   require added authorization to view the contents of OSPF RI LSAs
   containing geo-Location TLVs.  Refer to [PRIVACY] for more
   information.

   The Uncertainty and Confidence metrics for geo-location information
   as described in [GEO-PIDF-LO] are not included in the Geo Coordinates
   TLV.  In a future document, these may be considered for inclusion
   with additional Geo Location Sub-TLVs dependent on both on
   requirements and adoption of [GEO-PIDF-LO].

7.  IANA Considerations

   The document will require the following IANA actions:

   1.  A Router Information TLV type for the Geo Location TLV will be
       allocated from the OSPF Router Information (RI) TLVs registry.

   The RFC text was produced using Marshall Rose's xml2rfc tool.

   The encoding of the Geo location is adapted from the "Geo Coordinate
   LISP Canonical Address Format" specified in the "LISP Canonical
   Address Format (LCAF)".  We would like to thank the authors of that
   Document and particularily Dino Farinacci for subsequent discussions.

   Thanks to Yi Yang for review and discussions of the Geo Coordinate
   encoding.

   The use-case for using OSPF to advertise the geo-location in OSPF was
   first mentioned in an OSPF operator-defined TLV draft by Uma
   Chunduri, Xiaohu Xu, Luis M.  Contreras, Mohamed Boucadair, and Luay
   Jalil.
