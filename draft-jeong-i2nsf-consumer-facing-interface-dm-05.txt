            I2NSF Consumer-Facing Interface YANG Data Model
           draft-jeong-i2nsf-consumer-facing-interface-dm-05

Abstract

   This document describes a YANG data model for the Consumer-Facing
   Interface between an Interface to Network Security Functions (I2NSF)
   User and Security Controller in an I2NSF system in a Network
   Functions Virtualization (NFV) environment.  The data model is
   required for enabling different users of a given I2NSF system to
   define, manage, and monitor security policies for specific flows
   within an administrative domain.

1.  Introduction

   This document provides a YANG [RFC6020] data model that defines the
   required data for the Consumer-Facing Interface between an Interface
   to Network Security Functions (I2NSF) User and Security Controller in
   an I2NSF system [i2nsf-framework] in a Network Functions
   Virtualization (NFV) environment.  The data model is required for
   enabling different users of a given I2NSF system to define, manage
   and monitor security policies for specific flows within an
   administrative domain.  This document defines a YANG data model based
   on the information model of I2NSF Consumer-Facing Interface
   [client-facing-inf-im].

   Data models are defined at a lower level of abstraction and provide
   many details.  They provide details about the implementation of a
   protocol's specification, e.g., rules that explain how to map managed

   objects onto lower-level protocol constructs.  Since conceptual
   models can be implemented in different ways, multiple data models can
   be derived by a single information model.

   The efficient and flexible provisioning of network functions by NFV
   leads to a rapid advance in the network industry.  As practical
   applications, network security functions (NSFs), such as firewall,
   intrusion detection system (IDS)/intrusion protection system (IPS),
   and attack mitigation, can also be provided as virtual network
   functions (VNF) in the NFV system.  By the efficient virtual
   technology, these VNFs might be automatically provisioned and
   dynamically migrated based on real-time security requirements.  This
   document presents a YANG data model to implement security functions
   based on NFV.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC3444].

3.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology described in
   [i2nsf-terminology][client-facing-inf-im][client-facing-inf-req].

4.  Data Modeling for Consumer-Facing Interface

   The main objective of this data model is to fully transform the
   information model [client-facing-inf-im] into a YANG data model that
   can be used for delivering control and management messages via the
   Consumer-Facing Interface between an I2NSF User and Security
   Controller for the I2NSF User's high-level security policies.

   The semantics of the data model must be aligned with the information
   model of the Consumer-Facing Interface.  The transformation of the
   information model was performed so that this YANG data model can
   facilitate the efficient delivery of the control or management
   messages.

   This data model is designed to support the I2NSF framework that can
   be extended according to the security needs.  In other words, the
   model design is independent of the content and meaning of specific
   policies as well as the implementation approach.  This document
   suggests a VoIP/VoLTE security service as a use case for policy rule
   generation.

6.  Security Considerations

   The data model for the I2NSF Consumer-Facing Interface is derived
   from the I2NSF Consumer-Facing Interface Information Model
   [client-facing-inf-im], so the same security considerations with the
   information model should be included in this document.  The data
   model needs to support a mechanism to protect Consumer-Facing
   Interface to Security Controller.

Appendix A.  Changes from draft-jeong-i2nsf-consumer-facing-interface-
             dm-04

   The following changes have been made from draft-jeong-i2nsf-consumer-
   facing-interface-dm-04:

   o  Sections 4 and 5 have been revised to produce a data tree model
      and YANG data model according to the information model and Event-
      Condition-Action (ECA) based policy generation as suggested in the
      most recent draft about the I2NSF Consumer-Facing Interface
      Information Model [client-facing-inf-im] and I2NSF Framework
      [i2nsf-framework].

   o  The data tree model in Appendix B and Yang in Appendix C have also
      been modified for better adoption of ECA based policy generation.

   o  An example XML format output has been modified in Appendix D for
      VoIP service policy based on Yang in Appendix C.

   o  Overall editorial errors have been corrected.

Appendix B.  Use Case: Policy Instance Example for VoIP/VoLTE Security
             Services

   A common scenario for VoIP/VoLTE policy enforcement could be that a
   malicious call is made to a benign user of any telecommunication
   company.  For example, imagine a case wherea company "A" employs a
   hacker with a malicious attempt to hack a user's phone with malware.
   The company "A" is located in a country, such as Africa, and uses the
   user's hacked phone to call the company.  The hacked user is unaware
   of the company "A" so complains about the international call that was
   made to the company "B", which is the user's telecommunications
   company.  The company "A" charges the company "B" for the
   international call.  The company "B" cannot charge the user for the
   call, and has no choice but to pay the company "A".  The following
   shows the example data tree model for the VoIP/VoLTE services.
   Multi-tenancy, endpoint groups, threat prevention, and telemetry data
   components are general part of the tree model, so we can just modify
   the policy instance in order to generate and enforce high-level
   policies.  The policy-calendar can act as a scheduler to set the star
   and end time to block calls which uses suspicious ids, or calls from
   other countries.
