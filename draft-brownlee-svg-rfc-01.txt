1.  Introduction

   Over the last two years the RFC Editor has worked with the Internet
   community to develop specifications for changes in the format of
   RFCs.  An outline of the resulting specifications was published as
   [RFC6949] in May 2013.  Since then a Design Team has been working
   with the RFC Editor to flesh out those specifications.  One aspect of
   the changes is to allow line drawings in RFCs; [RFC6949] says

      "Graphics may include ASCII art and a more complex form to be
      defined, such as SVG line art [SVG].  Color and grayscale will not
      be accepted.  RFCs must correctly display in monochromatic black-
      and-white to allow for monochrome displays, black-and- white
      printing, and support for visual disabilities."

   SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) has been developed by W3C, the World
   Wide Web Consortium; its current standard is SVG 1.1 Full
   [W3C.REC-SVG11-20110816].  This document defines SVG 1.2 RFC, an SVG
   profile (i.e. a subset of SVG) that is suitable for RFC line
   drawings.

   Note that in RFCs, the text provides normative descriptions of
   protocols, systems, etc.  Diagrams may be used to help explain
   concepts more clearly, but they are informative, not normative.

2.  SVG 1.2 RFC: An SVG profile for RFCs

   As a starting point for SVG 1.2 RFC, the Design Team decided to use
   SVG 1.2 Tiny [W3C.REC-SVGTiny12-20081222].  SVG 1.2 Tiny is an SVG
   subset intended to be implemented on small, mobile devices such as
   cellphones and smartphones.  That should allow RFCs to be rendered

   well on such devices, especially those that have small screens.
   However, RFCs are self-contained documents that do not change once
   they are published.  The use of SVG drawings in RFCs is intended to
   allow authors to create drawings that are simple to produce, and
   easier to understand than our traditional 'ASCII Art' ones.  In
   short, we are also trying to improve access to the content in RFCs,
   so SVG drawings need to be kept as simple as possible.

   SVG can provide a complete User Interface, but within RFCs, all we
   need are simple diagrams that do not change once the RFC is
   published.  Therefore, SVG RFC does not allow anything from the
   following sections in SVG Tiny 1.2 [W3C.REC-SVGTiny12-20081222]:

   12  Multimedia
   13  Interactivity
   15  Scripting
   16  Animation
   18  Metadata
   19  Extensibility

   Note that SVG Tiny 1.2 elements may have many properties or
   attributes that are needed to support aspects of the above sections.
   Those are not allowed in SVG 1.2 RFC.

   Considering the other sections in SVG Tiny 1.2
   [W3C.REC-SVGTiny12-20081222]:

    9 Basic Shapes
   10 Text
        Everything in these sections is allowed in SVG 1.2 RFC.

   11 Painting: Filling, Stroking, Colors and Paint Servers
        Anything relating to 'color' is not allowed in SVG 1.2 RFC,
        everything else is allowed.

   14 Linking
        SVG Tiny 1.2 allows internationalized IRIs in references.  In
        SVG 1.2 RFC such links must be ASCII only.  That should not
        cause problems, since one can just use the URI form of any IRI.
        Authors should try to use links only to URIs that are long-trem
        stable.


   17 Fonts
        SVG 1.2 RFC only allows 'serif', 'sans-serif' and 'monospace'
        generic font families from the WebFonts facility, described in
        CSS 2.1 [W3C.REC-CSS2-20110607], section 15, Fonts.  In
        particular, the SVG 'font' element is not allowed.

3.  How to create SVG drawings

   Many drawing packages can be used to create SVG drawings, for example
   Open Source packages Inkscape and Dia.  Be aware that such packages
   may use SVG elements or attributes that are not allowed in SVG 1.2
   RFC.  For example, the 'marker' attribute is often used to place
   symbols such as arrowheads on lines, but 'marker' is not allowed in
   SVG 1.2 Tiny or SVG 1.2 RFC.  In such cases one has to draw the
   arrowhead in another, simpler way.

   We will need to provide a tool to check that a diagram only uses
   elements and attributes that are allowed in SVG 1.2 RFC.  These are
   listed in the Appendix below.  [Need to take the lists from SVG Tiny
   1.2 and prune them for SVG 1.2 RFC.  TBD]

   Diagrams produced with these packages may produce large SVG files
   that are hard to read or understand directly.  We should provide a
   tool to strip out unnecccessary attributes; authors could run that
   tool over their drawings, and see whether such stripping causes any
   visible changes.

   Another way to create SVG drawings is to write programs to draw them.
   For example, using python and its svgwrite module is a pleasant
   environment (for those who like writing code).

4.  Meta-language for diagrams common in RFCs

4.1.  State Diagrams

4.2.  Sequence Digrgams

4.3.  Packet Layout Diarrams

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not create a new registry nor does it register any
   values in existing registries; no IANA action is required.

6.  Acknowledgements

   Thanks to the Design Team members for their helpful comments and
   suggestions for SVG 1.2 RFC.

   version -01, 11 Feb 14:
      Allow links to 'long-term stable URIs'
      Link URIs must be ASCII only
      Need for tools to check SVG 1.2 RFC compatibilty and to strip
      'unneccessary' attributes explicitly stated.
      Statement that drawings can't be normative removed; Postscript-
      only RFCs already exist.
