         Technical Considerations for Internet Service Blocking
              draft-barnes-blocking-considerations-00.txt

Abstract

   The Internet is structured to be an open communications medium.  This
   openness is one of the key underpinnings of Internet innovation, but
   it can allow bad communications as well as good.  Thus, as the
   Internet has grown, so have mechanisms to limit the extent and impact
   of abusive or illegal communications.  Recently, there has been an
   increasing emphasis on "blocking", the active prevention of abusive
   or illegal communications.  This document examines several technical
   approaches to Internet service blocking in terms of their fit with
   the overall Internet architecture.  In general, the approach to
   service blocking that is most coherent with the Internet architecture
   is to inform endpoints about bad services, so that the communicants
   can avoid engaging in abusive or illegal communications.
