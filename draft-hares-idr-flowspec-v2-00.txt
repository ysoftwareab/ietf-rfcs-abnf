                    BGP Flow Specification Version 2
                   draft-hares-idr-flowspec-v2-00.txt

Abstract

   BGP flow specification version 1 (RFC5575) describes the distribution
   of traffic filter policy (traffic filters and actions) which are
   distributed via BGP to BGP peers.  Three applications utilize this
   traffic filter policy: (1) mitigation of Denial of Service (DoS), (2)
   enabling of traffic filtering in BGP/MPLS VPNS, and (3)centralized
   traffic control for networks with SDN or NFV controllers.
   Application of centralized traffic utilizing BGP Flow Specification
   traffic filters may need user-ordered filters rather than RFC5575's
   strict ordering of filters and defined ordering of actions.

   This document proposes a new BGP Flow specification version 2 that
   supports user-order of filters and actions plus allowing more actions

1.  Introduction

   BGP flow specification [RFC5575] describes the distribution of
   filters and actions that apply when packets are received on a router
   with the flow specification function turned on.  If one considers the
   reception of the packet as an event, then BGP flow specification
   describes a set of minimalistic Event-MatchCondition-Action (ECA)
   policies were the match-condition is defined in the BGP NLRI, and the
   action is defined either by the default condition (accept traffic) or
   actions defined in Extended BGP Communiites values [RFC4360].

   The initial set of policy [RFC5575] and [RFC7674] for this policy
   includes 12 types of match filters encoded in two application
   specific AFI/SAFIs for the IPv4 AFI.

      IP traffic: AFI:1, SAFI, 133;

      BGP/MPLS VPN AFI:1 VPN SAFI, 134) for IPv4.

   The popularity of these flow specification filters in deployment for
   DoS and SDN/NFV has led to the requirement for more BGP flow
   specification match filters in the NLRI and more BGP flow
   specification actions.

   This document describes distribution of two new BGP Flow
   Specification NLRI (2 AFI/SAFI pairs) that allow user-ordered list of
   traffic match filters, and user-ordered traffic match actions encoded
   in BGP Wide Communities.

   of BGP Flow Specification rules that combine filters in BGP NLRI with
   actions in BGP Extended communities.

      Figure 1: BGP Flow Specification Policy

   BGP Flow Specification (BGP-FS) ([RFC5575] and
   [I-D.raszuk-idr-rfc5575bis]) describes how to distribute the BGP Flow
   Specification policy as BGP routes which are locally configured on
   the originating BGP peer.  Like BGP routes, if the BGP peer session
   drops then BGP Flow Specification routes are dropped.  [RFC5575] and
   [I-D.raszuk-idr-rfc5575bis] do not indicate how the BGP Flow
   Specification policy is installed in the kernel.

1.1.  RFC5575 vs. NETCONF/RESTCONF/I2RS Flow Filters

   [RFC5575] describes the dissemination of flow specification rules
   policy is similar to the the statically configured Filter-Based RIB
   described in [I-D.ietf-i2rs-fb-rib-data-model], and the I2RS Filter-
   Based RIB ([I-D.ietf-i2rs-fb-rib-info-model],
   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-fb-rib-data-model],
   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-pkt-eca-data-model]).  These FB-RIBs start on the

      Figure 2: I2RS Filter-Based RIB Policy

   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-fb-rib-data-model] suggests that the storage of BGP
   Flow Specification routes in the kernel should utilize the same
   format as the statically configured FB-RIB and the I2RS ephemeral FB-
   RIB so that these traffic filters may be compared.  This draft also
   proposes that precedence between these three sources of filters in
   the kernel (statically configured, I2RS ephemeral, and BGP ephemeral
   routes) can either set by local policy or defaults.  If it is set by
   defaults [I-D.ietf-i2rs-fb-rib-data-model] suggests the default
   precedence between static, I2RS, and BGP-FS installed filters is:

   o  static FB-RIB -highest precedence (wins all ties)

   o  I2RS FB-RIB - middle preference (wins over BGP-FS originated
      routes, loses to static FB-RIB),

3.  Dissemination of BGP Flow Specification version 2 NLRI and Wide
    Communities

   The BGP Flow Specification version 2 (BGP-FS v2) uses an NRLI with
   the format for AFI/SAFI (SAFI = TBD) for IP flow, and AFI/SAFI for
   BGP/MPLS (SAFI = TBD).  This NLRI information is encoded using
   MP_READ_NRI and MP_UNREACH_NLRI attributes defined in [RFC4760].
   Whenever the corresponding application does not require Next-HOP
   information, this shall be encoded as zero-octet length Next Hop in
   the MP_REAC_NLRI and ignored upon receipt.

   Implementatinos wishing to exchange flow specificastion rules MUST
   use BGP's Capability Advertisement facility to exchange the
   Multiprotocol Extension Capability Code (Code 1) as defined in
   [RFC4760].

3.1.  Encoding of BGP-FS v2 Filters

   The AFI/SAFI NLRI for BGP Flow Specification has the format

    +------------------------+
    |length (2 octets)       |
    +------------------------+
    | Sub-TLVs (variable)    |
    | +====================+ |
    | | order (2 octets)   | |
    | +--------------------+ |
    | | type (2 octets)    | |

    | | value (variable)   | |
    | |[multiples of       | |
    | | 2 octets]          | |
    | +====================+ |
    +------------------------+

    Figure 16 - NRLI revision

   where:

   o  length - is the length of the NLRI,

   o  Sub-TLVs contain a user-ordered set of filter components as
      defined in [RFC5575] and [I-D.raszuk-idr-rfc5575bis].  The ranges
      are defined as: standard BGP Flow Specification filters (types
      0x01 - 0x3FFFF), and vendor specific filters (types 0x4ffff to
      0x7FFFF) with type values 0x8000 to 0xFFFFFFFF reserved for future
      use.  Each sub-tlv has an length of 2 octets, and a variable
      length value (in multiples of 2 octets).

   Filters are process in the order specified by the user.  If multiple
   filters exist for the same order, the strict filter ordering defined
   in [RFC5575] and [I-D.raszuk-idr-rfc5575bis] will be used for the
   filters with the same value for user order.

3.2.  Encoding of BGP-FS v2 Actions

   The BGP-FS version 2 actions are passed in a Wide Community
   [I-D.ietf-idr-wide-bgp-communities] atom with the following format.

   o  Action length - length of actions including variable field,

   o  Action values - value of actions (variable) defined in individual
      definitions.

   The BGP Flow Specification (BGP-FS) atom can be part of the Wide
   Community container (type 1) or the BGP Flow Specification Atom can
   be part of the BGP Flow Specification container (type 2) which will

3.3.  Required NLRI Validation

   Same as [RFC5575] and [I-D.raszuk-idr-rfc5575bis].

4.  Optional Security Additions

   This section discusses the optional BGP Security additions for BGP-FS
   v2: BGPSEC [I-D.ietf-sidr-bgpsec-protocol], ROA [RFC6482] and revised
   security for flow specification distributed from a centralized server
   within an AS [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-flowspec-oid].  These optional
   security parameters can be applied per BGP peer.

4.1.  BGP FS v2 and BGPSEC

   [RFC5575] does not require BGP Flow specifications to be passed
   BGPSEC [I-D.ietf-sidr-bgpsec-protocol].  BGP FS v2 can be passed in
   BGPSEC, but it is not required.

4.2.  BGP FS v2 with with ROA

   BGP-FS v2 can utilize ROAs in the validation.  If BGP-FS v2 is used
   with BGPSEC and ROA, the first thing is to vaildate the route within
   BGPSEC and second to utilize BGP ROA to validate the route origin.

   The BGP-FS peers using both ROA and BGP-FS validation determine that
   a BGP Flow specification is valid if and only if one of the following
   cases:

   o  If the BGP Flow Specification NLRI has a IPv4 or IPv6 address in
      destination address match filter and the following is true:

      *  A BGP ROA has been received to validate the originator, and

      *  the route is the best-match unicast route for the destination
         prefix embedded in the match filter; or

   o  If a BGP ROA has not been received that matches the IPv4 or IPv6
      destination address in the destination filter, the match filter
      must abide by the [RFC5575] validation rules of:

      *  The originator match of the flow specification matches the
         originator of the best-match unicast route for the destination
         prefix filter embedded in the flow specification", and

      *  No more specific unicast routes exist when compared with the
         flow destination prefix that have been received from a
         different neighboring AS than the best-match unicast route,
         which has been determined in step A.

   The best match is defined to be the longest-match NLRI with the
   highest preference.

4.3.  Revise Flow Specification Security for centralized Server

   The distribution of Flow Specifications from a centralized server
   supports mitigation of DoS attacks.  [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-flowspec-oid]
   suggests the following redefined procedure for validation for this
   case:

   A route is valid if the following conditions holds true:

Internet-Draft               BGP FlowSpec v2                   June 2016


   o  The originator of the flow specification matches the originator of
      the best-match unicast route for the destination prefix embedded
      in the flow specification.

   o  The AS_PATH and AS4_PATH attribute of the flow specification are
      empty (on originating AS)

   o  The AS_PATH and AS4_PATH attribute of the flow specification does
      not contain AS_SET and AS_SEQUENCE segments (on originating AS
      with AS Confederation)

   This reduced validation mechanism can be used for BGP-FS v2 within a
   single domain.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This section complies with [RFC7153]

   This document requests:

      SAFI be defined for IPv4 (AFI = 1), IPv6 (AFI=2), L2VPN (AFI=25)
      for BGP-FS

      SAFI be defined for BGP/MPLS IPv4 (AFI = 1), IPv6 (AFI=2), L2VPN
      (AFI=25) for BGP-FS

   Registry be created for BGP-FS V2 filter component types with the
   following ranges:

      0x00 - reserved

      0x01 - 0x3FFFF - standards action

      0x40000- 0x7FFFF - vendor specific filters

6.  Security Considerations

   The use of ROA improves on [RFC5575] to check the route orgination is
   valid can improve the validation sequence for a multiple-AS
   environment.  The use of BGPSEC [I-D.ietf-sidr-bgpsec-protocol] to
   secure the packet can increase security of BGP flow specification
   information sent in the packet.

   The use of the reduced validation within an AS
   [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-flowspec-oid] can provide adequate validation for
   distribution of flow specification within an single autonomous system
   for prevention of DDOS.

   Distribution of flow filters may provide insight into traffic being
   sent within an AS, but this information should be composite
   information that does not reveal the traffic patterns of individuals.
