Internet-Draft               DNS URL scheme                November 2000


1. Introduction and background

   DNS [1][2] is a widely deployed protocol used to, among other
   things, translate domain names into IP addresses.  More recent work
   has added support for storing certificates in DNS [5].  To be able
   to locate certificates available via network resources, URLs are
   often used.  To be able to reference certificates stored in DNS by a
   URL, a DNS URL scheme is required. The DNS URL scheme described here
   can be used to reference any DNS resource record, not only
   certificates.

   This memo is known to be incomplete and perhaps lack some of the
   background research required to properly define a new URL scheme. 
   Especially the BNF should not be regarded as cast in stone.

2. DNS URL Scheme

   A DNS URL designate a DNS resource record; by domain name, type and
   class and optionally server.  The DNS URL follow the generic syntax
   from RFC 2396 [4], and is described using ABNF [3] in section 5.

   A DNS URL is of the following general form.  This is intended to
   illustrate, not define, the scheme.

   dns:[//server/]domain;type=TYPE[;class=CLASS]

   Unless specified, the "server" is assumed to be locally configured,
   and "class" to be the Internet class ("IN").

3. Character encoding considerations

   Since 8-bit characters are not permitted in URLs, they must be
   encoded as per the "URI Generic Syntax" RFC.  The character set
   issue should be dealt with in this section, but awaits the outcome
   of the IDN work group.

4. Examples

   This illustrate a DNS query for "www.example.org" for the Internet
   class and the Address type:

   dns:www.example.org;class=IN;type=A

   This illustrate a DNS query for "simon.example.org" for the CERT
   type in the Internet class:

   dns:simon.example.org;type=CERT

   This illustrate a DNS query for "ftp.example.org" from the DNS

Internet-Draft               DNS URL scheme                November 2000


   server "internal-dns.example.org" server, and the address type:

   dns://internal-dns.example.org/ftp.example.org;type=A

5. DNS URL scheme BNF definition

   Strings are not case sensitive and free insertion of
   linear-white-space is not permitted.

   dnsurl       = "dns:" [ "//" hostport "/" ] hostname
                  ";TYPE=" type [";TYPE=" class]
                                ; See RFC 2396 for "hostport" and
                                ; "hostname" definition

   type         = "A" / "NS" / "MD" / ...
                                ; Any standard DNS type

   class        = "IN" / "CH" / ...
                                ; Any standard DNS class

6. Security Considerations

   A DNS URL does not embed confidential information.  If used to
   encode domain names in the Internet DNS environment, even the
   information retrieved is public.  If a DNS URL is used within a
   "internal" DNS environment, the same security considerations of the
   DNS environment apply to the use and handling of DNS URLs themselves
   and the data returned by looking up these URLs.

   This draft does not affect the security considerations related to
   DNS itself.
