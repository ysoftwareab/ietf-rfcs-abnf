1.  Introduction

   Information-Centric Networking (ICN) is an approach to evolve the
   Internet infrastructure to directly access Named Data Objects (NDOs)
   by its name, i.e., the name of NDO is directly used to route the
   request to the data object.  Such name based routing in ICN poses a
   number of issues, which are not solved yet in ICN.  These issues
   includes global scalability of routing, producer mobility, off-path
   cache, etc.  In order to address these issues, the name resolution
   function has been applied to several ICN projects and literature
   [Afanasyev][Zhang2][Ravindran][MF][Bayhan].

   The requirements of Name Resolution Service (NRS) has been discussed
   in [NRS] which focus on designing NRS itself in terms of service,
   system and security aspects.  As implementation of NRS, few NRS
   systems has been introduced in ICNRG.  [BNRS] is an NRS system
   utilizing bloom filter to support a flat name based routing and
   [NRS_CCNx] is another NRS implemented on CCNx to support a scalable
   routing system for CCN.  [NRS] has been well discussed on the
   considerations and requirements of NRS.  However, it is necessary to
   discuss the ICN architectural issues considered when NRS system is
   implemented in ICN.

   Thus, this document describes how ICN architecture changes and what
   implications are in the routing system when Name Resolution Sevice

   (NRS) is utilized in ICN.  It also discusses ICN architectural
   considerations for a NRS.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Background

   The name based routing in ICN poses a number of issues, such as
   global scalability of routing, producer mobility, off-path cache,
   etc., which are not solved yet in ICN.  In order to address these
   issues, the name resolution function as a Name Resolution Sevice
   (NRS) has been applied to several ICN projects and literature:

   o  Routing scalability : In ICN, application names identifying
      contents are used directly for packet delivery, so ICN routers run
      a name-based routing protocol to build namebased routing and
      forwarding tables.  As same as scalability of IP routing, if non-
      aggregated name prefixes are injected to the Default Route Free
      Zone (DFZ) of ICN, then they would be driving the growth of the
      DFZ routing table size.  Thus a NRS can be used as a solution to
      keep the routing table size under control, where the NRS resolves
      name prefixes which do not exist in the DFZ forwarding table into
      globally routable prefixes such as NDNS in [Afanasyev].

   o  Producer mobility : In ICN, if a producer moves into different
      authority domain or network location, then the request for a
      content produced by the moving producer with the origin name would
      be hardly forwarded to the moving producer.  Especially in a
      hierarchical name scheme, producer mobility support is much harder
      than in a flat name scheme since the routing tables related in
      broad area should be updated according to the producer movement.
      Therefore, various ICN literatures such as MobilityFirst [MF]
      would adopt NRS to retrieve the producer's location.

   o  Off-path caching : Caching in-network is considered to be a basic
      architectural component of an ICN architecture and caching
      approaches can be categorized into off-path caching and on-path
      caching based on the location of caches in relation to the
      forwarding path from a original server to a consumer.  Off-path
      caching, also referred as content replication or content storing,
      aims to replicate content within a network in order to increase
      availability, regardless of the relationship of the location to
      the forwarding path.  Thus, finding off-path cached objects is not
      trivial in name based routing of ICN.  In order to support off-

      path caches, replicas are usually advertised into a name- based
      routing system or into NRS such as in [Bayhan].

   Thus, this document discusses architectural considerations and
   implications of ICN when NRS is needed and utilized in ICN to solve
   such issues due to the name based routing in ICN.

4.  Implications of NRS in ICN

   In general, NRS is not mandatory in an ICN architecture and the
   majority of ICN projects use the name based routing which omits the
   name resolution.  Thus adopting a NRS would change the ICN
   architecure at least on procedures, latency, and security:

   o  Procedure : When NRS is adopted into an ICN architecture, the
      procedure of the name resolution has to be added into ICN overall
      procedures.  On changing procedures, there are certain things that
      have to be decided such as who and how the resolution does.

   o  Latency : When NRS is adopted into an ICN architecture, the
      additional latency of the resolution obviously occurs.  Although
      the latency of the resolution is added, the total latency could be
      minimized if the nearest copies or off-path caches can be found by
      NRS lookup.  Also, there might be a trade-off between the
      resolution latency and inter-damain traffic reduction.

   o  Security : When NRS is adopted into an ICN architecture, security
      treats could be increased with the above additional procedures,
      which include authentication of NRS messages and name spaces, and
      protecting NRS entities such as mapping servers from Denial of
      Service or Distributed Denial of service attacks.

5.  ICN Architectural Considerations for NRS

   This section discusses what kinds of things have to be considered
   from the point of view of ICN architecture when it utilizes a NRS.

5.1.  Resolution

   When a NRS is applying to an ICN architecture, the followings have to
   be considered:

   o  Who does the resolution?

   o  How does the resolution?

   The resolution can be done by consumer, routers, or both.  Once it is
   decided where the resolution takes place, it has to be considered how

Internet-Draft    Arch Considerations of ICN using NRS         July 2018


   the resolution does.  The name provided by consumer might be always
   resolved to identifiers in a differnet namespace just like DNS
   lookup.  Conversely, a NRS is ever needed to map names to a diferent
   namespace.

5.2.  Protocols and Semantics

   In order to develop NRS system whether in local ICN network domain or
   global ICN networking system, new protocol and semantics should be
   designed to manage and resolve in between different name spaces.
   Basically NRS can be implemented by extension of basic ICN TLV format
   and semantics ension of basic ICN TLV format and semantics
   [CCNxMessages] [CCNxSemantics].  For instance, resolution and
   response messages can be implemented by defining new type fields in
   Interest and Content Object message format [CCNxNRS].  Then it allows
   ICN architecture to minimize implication of ICN architectural
   changes.  But NRS system cannot support more flexible and scalable
   designs cause to restrict basic ICN protocol and semantics.

   On the other hand, NRS system can be implemented by using its own
   protocol and semantics like as existing NRS systems, such as [Hong].
   For instance, NRS protocol and messages can be implemented by using
   RESTful API.  Then NRS as application protocol can be operated
   independently from basic ICN architecture.  But ICN architecture
   cannot get assist of routing protocol itself effectively.

5.3.  Routing System

   It has to be considered how to process the resolved information by
   NRS lookup.  The results of an NRS operation can be intended to be
   used just to construct tunnels resulting in NRS identifying tunnel
   endpoints.

   Another way to process the resolved information by NRS lookup is to
   use it as routing hints in request messages.  In this case, request
   message needs to be re-written by the resolved information including
   the original name that was requested by consumer to check the data
   integrity.

6.  Security Considerations

   When NRS is adopted in an ICN architecture, security threats shall be
   increased in various aspects such as followings.

Internet-Draft    Arch Considerations of ICN using NRS         July 2018


6.1.  Name Space Separation

   In order to deploy NRS on ICN architecture, ICN name spaces are
   separated into more than two name spaces.  Thus these name spaces
   should be mapped and managed securely.  According to the ICN research
   challenge [RFC7927], new name space can also provide an integrity
   verification function to authenticate its publishers.  In addition to
   the verification, binding two different name spaces should be
   securely required.

6.2.  NRS System

   NRS enables deployment of new entities to build distributed and
   scalable NRS system.  Thus, the entities, e.g., mapping server that
   can be a mapping database., could be a single point of failure cause
   to receive malicious requests from innumerable adversaries like as
   mount Denial of Service or Distributed Denial of service attacks.
   Additionally, in order to communicate with the entities to build NRS
   system, an initiator should rely on other NRS entities that are
   designed to distributed deploy mapping servers in each network
   domains.  Because malicious entities should be involved in this
   communication to impersonate control functions.  Thus, NRS entities
   should trust each other and communications with them should be
   protected securely.

6.3.  NRS Protocols and Messages

   Regarding NRS messages, such as lookup, update, and etc., if these
   messages are transported unauthenticated, an adversary can manipulate
   them and hijack the important communication to response or to store
   fake data.  Thus, the adversary can generate malicious traffics to be
   redirected to victim hosts.  Therefore, security requirements for NRS
   should be considered to protect ICN architecture as well as NRS.
