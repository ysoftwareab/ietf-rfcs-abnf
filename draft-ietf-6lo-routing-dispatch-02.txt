              6LoWPAN Routing Header And Paging Dispatches
                   draft-ietf-6lo-routing-dispatch-02

Abstract

   This specification introduces a new 6LoWPAN dispatch type for use in
   6LoWPAN Route-Over topologies, that initially covers the needs of RPL
   (RFC6550) data packets compression.  Using this dispatch type, this
   specification defines a method to compress RPL Option (RFC6553)
   information and Routing Header type 3 (RFC6554), an efficient IP-in-
   IP technique and is extensible for more applications.

1.  Introduction

   The design of Low Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) is generally
   focused on saving energy, a very constrained resource in most cases.
   The other constraints, such as the memory capacity and the duty
   cycling of the LLN devices, derive from that primary concern.  Energy
   is often available from primary batteries that are expected to last
   for years, or is scavenged from the environment in very limited
   quantities.  Any protocol that is intended for use in LLNs must be
   designed with the primary concern of saving energy as a strict
   requirement.

   Controlling the amount of data transmission is one possible venue to
   save energy.  In a number of LLN standards, the frame size is limited



Thubert, et al.           Expires July 17, 2016                 [Page 2]

Internet-Draft6LoWPAN Routing Header And Paging Dispatches  January 2016


   to much smaller values than the IPv6 maximum transmission unit (MTU)
   of 1280 bytes.  In particular, an LLN that relies on the classical
   Physical Layer (PHY) of IEEE 802.15.4 [IEEE802154] is limited to 127
   bytes per frame.  The need to compress IPv6 packets over IEEE
   802.15.4 led to the 6LoWPAN Header Compression [RFC6282] work
   (6LoWPAN-HC).

   Innovative Route-over techniques have been and are still being
   developed for routing inside a LLN.  In a general fashion, such
   techniques require additional information in the packet to provide
   loop prevention and to indicate information such as flow
   identification, source routing information, etc.

   For reasons such as security and the capability to send ICMP errors
   back to the source, an original packet must not be tampered with, and
   any information that must be inserted in or removed from an IPv6
   packet must be placed in an extra IP-in-IP encapsulation.  This is
   the case when the additional routing information is inserted by a
   router on the path of a packet, for instance a mesh root, as opposed
   to the source node.  This is also the case when some routing
   information must be removed from a packet that flows outside the LLN.
   When to use RFC 6553, 6554 and IPv6-in-IPv6
   [I-D.robles-roll-useofrplinfo] details different cases where RFC
   6553, RFC 6554 and IPv6-in-IPv6 encapsulation is required to set the
   bases to help defining the compression of RPL routing information in
   LLN environments.

   When using [RFC6282] the outter IP header of an IP-in-IP
   encapsulation may be compressed down to 2 octets in stateless
   compression and down to 3 octets in case of a stateful compression
   when a context information must be added.

   The Stateless Compression of an IPv6 addresses can only happen if the
   IPv6 address can de deduced from the MAC addresses, meaning that the
   IP end point is also the MAC-layer endpoint.  This is generally not
   the case in a RPL network which is generally a multi-hop route-over
   (operated at Layer-3) network.  A better compression, that does not
   involve variable compressions depending on the hop in the mesh, can
   be achieved based on the fact that the outter encapsulation is

   usually between the source (or destination) of the inner packet and
   the root.  Also, the inner IP header can only be compressed by
   [RFC6282] if all the fields up to it are also compressed.  This
   specification makes it so that the inner IP header is the first
   header that is compressed by [RFC6282], and conserves the inner
   packet encoded the same way whether it is encapsulated or not,
   conserving existing implementation.

   As an example, the Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks
   [RFC6550] (RPL) is designed to optimize the routing operations in
   constrained LLNs.  As part of this optimization, RPL requires the
   addition of RPL Packet Information (RPI) in every packet, as defined
   in Section 11.2 of [RFC6550].

   The RPL Option for Carrying RPL Information in Data-Plane Datagrams
   [RFC6553] specification indicates how the RPI can be placed in a RPL
   Option for use in an IPv6 Hop-by-Hop header.  This representation
   demands a total of 8 bytes when in most cases the actual RPI payload
   requires only 19 bits.  Since the Hop-by-Hop header must not flow
   outside of the RPL domain, it must be removed from packets that leave
   the domain, and be inserted in packets entering the domain.  In both
   cases, this operation implies an IP-in-IP encapsulation.

             Figure 2: IP-in-IP Encapsulation within the LLN.

   Additionally, in the case of the Non-Storing Mode of Operation (MOP),
   RPL requires a Routing Header type 3 (RH3) as defined in the IPv6
   Routing Header for Source Routes with RPL [RFC6554] specification,
   for all packets that are routed down a RPL graph.  With Non-Storing
   RPL, even if the source is a node in the same LLN, the packet must
   first reach up the graph to the root so that the root can insert the
   RH3 to go down the graph.  In any fashion, whether the packet was

   originated in a node in the LLN or outside the LLN, and regardless of
   whether the packet stays within the LLN or not, as long as the source
   of the packet is not the root itself, the source-routing operation
   also implies an IP-in-IP encapsulation at the root in order to insert
   the RH3.

   6TiSCH [I-D.ietf-6tisch-architecture] specifies the operation of IPv6
   over the TimeSlotted Channel Hopping [RFC7554] (TSCH) mode of
   operation of IEEE 802.15.4.  The architecture requires the use of
   both RPL and the 6lo adaptation layer over IEEE 802.15.4.  Because it
   inherits the constraints on the frame size from the MAC layer, 6TiSCH
   cannot afford to spend 8 bytes per packet on the RPI.  Hence the
   requirement for a 6LoWPAN header compression of the RPI.

   An extensible compression technique is required that simplifies IP-
   in-IP encapsulation when it is needed, and optimally compresses
   existing routing artifacts found in RPL LLNs.

   This specification extends the 6lo adaptation layer framework
   ([RFC4944],[RFC6282]) so as to carry routing information for route-
   over networks based on RPL.  The specification includes the formats
   necessary for RPL and is extensible for additional formats.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   The Terminology used in this document is consistent with and
   incorporates that described in `Terminology in Low power And Lossy
   Networks' [RFC7102] and [RFC6550].

   The terms Route-over and Mesh-under are defined in [RFC6775].

   Other terms in use in LLNs are found in [RFC7228].

   The term "byte" is used in its now customary sense as a synonym for
   "octet".

3.  Using the Page Dispatch

   The6LoWPAN Paging Dispatch [I-D.ietf-paging-dispatch] specification
   extends the 6lo adaptation layer framework ([RFC4944], [RFC6282]) by
   introducing a concept of "context" in the 6LoWPAN parser, a context
   being identified by a Page number.  The specification defines 16
   Pages.

   This draft operates within the Page 1, which is indicated by a
   Dispatch Value of binary 11110001.

3.1.  New Routing Header Dispatch (6LoRH)

   This specification introduces a new 6LoWPAN Routing Header (6LoRH) to
   carry IPv6 routing information.  The 6LoRH may contain source routing
   information such as a compressed form of RH3, as well as other sorts
   of routing information such as the RPL Packet Information and IP-in-
   IP encapsulation.

   The 6LoRH is expressed in a 6loWPAN packet as a Type-Length-Value
   (TLV) field, which is extensible for future use.

   This specification uses the bit pattern 10xxxxxx in Page 1 for the
   new 6LoRH Dispatch and Section 4 describes how RPL artifacts in data
   packets can be compressed as 6LoRH headers.

3.2.  Placement Of The 6LoRH

   In a zone of a packet where Page 1 is active, which means once a Page
   1 Paging Dispatch is parsed, and as long as no other Paging Dispatch
   is parsed, the parsing of the packet MUST follow this specification
   if the 6LoRH Bit Pattern Section 3.1 is found.

   With this specification, the 6LoRH Dispatch is only defined in Page
   1, so it MUST be placed in the packet in a zone where the Page 1
   context is active.

   One or more 6LoRH header(s) MAY be placed in a 6LoWPAN packet.  A
   6LoRH header MUST always be placed before the LOWPAN_IPHC as defined
   in 6LoWPAN Header Compression [RFC6282].

   A 6LoRH header being always placed in a Page 1 context, it MUST
   always be placed after any Fragmentation Header and/or Mesh Header
   [RFC4944].

4.  6LoWPAN Routing Header General Format

   The 6LoRH reuses in Page 1 the Dispatch Value Bit Pattern of
   10xxxxxx.

   The Dispatch Value Bit Pattern is split in two forms of 6LoRH:

      Elective (6LoRHE) that may skipped if not understood

      Critical (6LoRHC) that may not be ignored

Internet-Draft6LoWPAN Routing Header And Paging Dispatches  January 2016


4.1.  Elective Format

   The 6LoRHE uses the Dispatch Value Bit Pattern of 101xxxxx.  A 6LoRHE
   may be ignored and skipped in parsing.  If it is ignored, the 6LoRHE
   is forwarded with no change inside the LLN.

   Length:
      Length of the 6LoRHE expressed in bytes, excluding the first 2
      bytes.  This enables a node to skip a 6LoRHE header that it does
      not support and/or cannot parse, for instance if the Type is not
      known.

   Type:
      Type of the 6LoRHE

4.2.  Critical Format

   The 6LoRHC uses the Dispatch Value Bit Pattern of 100xxxxx.

   A node which does not support the 6LoRHC Type MUST silently discard
   the packet.

   Note: The situation where a node receives a message with a Critical
   6LoWPAN Routing Header that it does not understand is a critical
   administrative error whereby the wrong device is placed in a network.
   It makes no sense to overburden the constrained device with code that
   would cause ICMP error to the source.  Rather, it is expected that
   the device will raise some management alert indicating that it cannot
   operate in this network for that reason.  It results that there is no
   provision for the exchange of error messages for this situation; it
   should be avoided by judicious use of administrative control and/or
   capability indications by the device manufacturer.

   TSE:
      Type Specific Extension.  The meaning depends on the Type, which
      must be known in all of the nodes.  The interpretation of the TSE
      depends on the Type field that follows.  For instance, it may be
      used to transport control bits, the number of elements in an
      array, or the length of the remainder of the 6LoRHC expressed in a
      unit other than bytes.

5.  The Routing Header Type 3 (RH3) 6LoRH

   The Routing Header type 3 (RH3) 6LoRH (RH3-6LoRH) is a Critical
   6LoWPAN Routing Header that provides a compressed form for the RH3,
   as defined in [RFC6554] for use by RPL routers.  Routers that need to
   forward a packet with a RH3-6LoRH are expected to be RPL routers and
   are expected to support this specification.  If a non-RPL router
   receives a packet with a RH3-6LoRH, this means that there was a
   routing error and the packet should be dropped so the Type cannot be
   ignored.

            Size indicates the number of compressed addresses

   The values for the RH3-6LoRH Type are an enumeration, 0 to 4.  The
   form of compression is indicated by the Type.  The unit (as a number
   of bytes) in which the Size is expressed depends on the Type as
   described in Figure 6:

                      Figure 6: The RH3-6LoRH Types.

   In the case of a RH3-6LoRH, the TSE field is used as a Size, which
   encodes the number of hops minus 1; so a Size of 0 means one hop, and
   the maximum that can be encoded is 32 hops.  (If more than 32 hops
   need to be expressed, a sequence of RH3-6LoRH can be employed.)

   The Next Hop is indicated in the first entry of the first RH3-6LoRH.
   Upon reception, the router checks whether it owns the address
   indicated as Next Hop, which MUST be the case in a strict source
   routing environment.  If it is so, the entry is removed from the
   RH3-6LoRH and the Size is decremented.  If the Size is now zero, the
   whole RH3-6LoRH is removed.  If there is no more RH3-6LoRH, the
   processing node is the last router on the way, which may or may not
   be collocated with the final destination.

   The last hop in the last RH3-6LoRH is the last router on the way to
   the destination in the LLN.  In a classical RPL network, all nodes
   are routers so the last hop is effectively the destination as well.
   But in the general case, even when there is a RH3-6LoRH header
   present, the address of the final destination is always indicated in
   the LoWPAN_IPHC [RFC6282].

   If some bits of the first address in the RH3-6LoRH can be derived
   from the final destination in the LoWPAN_IPHC, then that address may
   be compressed, otherwise it is expressed as a full IPv6 address of
   128 bits.  Next addresses only need to express the delta from the
   previous address.

   All addresses in a given RH3-6LoRH header are compressed in a same
   fashion, down to the same number of bytes per address.  In order to
   get different forms of compression, multiple consecutive RH3-6LoRH
   must be used.

6.  The RPL Packet Information 6LoRH

   [RFC6550], Section 11.2, specifies the RPL Packet Information (RPI)
   as a set of fields that are placed by RPL routers in IP packets for
   the purpose of Instance Identification, as well as Loop Avoidance and
   Detection.

   In particular, the SenderRank, which is the scalar metric computed by
   an specialized Objective Function such as [RFC6552], indicates the
   Rank of the sender and is modified at each hop.  The SenderRank field
   is used to validate that the packet progresses in the expected
   direction, either upwards or downwards, along the DODAG.

   RPL defines the RPL Option for Carrying RPL Information in Data-Plane
   Datagrams [RFC6553] to transport the RPI, which is carried in an IPv6
   Hop-by-Hop Options Header [RFC2460], typically consuming eight bytes
   per packet.

   With [RFC6553], the RPL option is encoded as six Octets; it must be
   placed in a Hop-by-Hop header that consumes two additional octets for
   a total of eight.  In order to limit its range to the inside the RPL
   domain, the Hop-by-Hop header must be added to (or removed from)
   packets that cross the border of the RPL domain.

   The 8-byte overhead is detrimental to the LLN operation, in
   particular with regards to bandwidth and battery constraints.  These
   bytes may cause a containing frame to grow above maximum frame size,
   leading to Layer 2 or 6LoWPAN [RFC4944] fragmentation, which in turn
   causes even more energy spending and issues discussed in the LLN
   Fragment Forwarding and Recovery
   [I-D.thubert-6lo-forwarding-fragments].

   An additional overhead comes from the need, in certain cases, to add
   an IP-in-IP encapsulation to carry the Hop-by-Hop header.  This is
   needed when the router that inserts the Hop-by-Hop header is not the
   source of the packet, so that an error can be returned to the router.
   This is also the case when a packet originated by a RPL node must be
   stripped from the Hop-by-Hop header to be routed outside the RPL
   domain.

   This specification defines an IPinIP-6LoRH in Section 7 for that
   purpose, but it must be noted that stripping a 6LoRH does not require
   a manipulation of the packet in the LOWPAN_IPHC, and thus, if the
   source address in the LOWPAN_IPHC is the node that inserted the
   IPinIP-6LoRH then this alone does not mandate an IPinIP-6LoRH.

   Note: A typical packet in RPL non-storing mode going down the RPL
   graph requires an IP-in-IP encapsulating the RH3, whereas the RPI is



Thubert, et al.           Expires July 17, 2016                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft6LoWPAN Routing Header And Paging Dispatches  January 2016


   usually (and quite illegally) omitted, unless it is important to
   indicate the RPLInstanceID.  To match this structure, an optimized
   IP-in-IP 6LoRH is defined in Section 7.

   As a result, a RPL packet may bear only an RPI-6LoRH and no IPinIP-
   6LoRH.  In that case, the source and destination of the packet are
   located in the LOWPAN_IPHC.

   As with [RFC6553], the fields in the RPI include an 'O', an 'R', and
   an 'F' bit, an 8-bit RPLInstanceID (with some internal structure),
   and a 16-bit SenderRank.

   The remainder of this section defines the RPI-6LoRH, a Critical
   6LoWPAN Routing Header that is designed to transport the RPI in
   6LoWPAN LLNs.

6.1.  Compressing the RPLInstanceID

   RPL Instances are discussed in [RFC6550], Section 5.  A number of
   simple use cases do not require more than one instance, and in such
   cases, the instance is expected to be the global Instance 0.  A
   global RPLInstanceID is encoded in a RPLInstanceID field as follows:

       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |0|     ID      |  Global RPLInstanceID in 0..127
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

        Figure 7: RPLInstanceID Field Format for Global Instances.

   For the particular case of the global Instance 0, the RPLInstanceID
   field is all zeros.  This specification allows to elide a
   RPLInstanceID field that is all zeros, and defines a I flag that,
   when set, signals that the field is elided.

6.2.  Compressing the SenderRank

   The SenderRank is the result of the DAGRank operation on the rank of
   the sender; here the DAGRank operation is defined in [RFC6550],
   Section 3.5.1, as:

      DAGRank(rank) = floor(rank/MinHopRankIncrease)

   If MinHopRankIncrease is set to a multiple of 256, the least
   significant 8 bits of the SenderRank will be all zeroes; by eliding
   those, the SenderRank can be compressed into a single byte.  This
   idea is used in [RFC6550] by defining DEFAULT_MIN_HOP_RANK_INCREASE




Thubert, et al.           Expires July 17, 2016                [Page 11]

Internet-Draft6LoWPAN Routing Header And Paging Dispatches  January 2016


   as 256 and in [RFC6552] that defaults MinHopRankIncrease to
   DEFAULT_MIN_HOP_RANK_INCREASE.

   This specification allows to encode the SenderRank as either one or
   two bytes, and defines a K flag that, when set, signals that a single
   byte is used.

6.3.  The Overall RPI-6LoRH encoding

   The RPI-6LoRH provides a compressed form for the RPL RPI.  Routers
   that need to forward a packet with a RPI-6LoRH are expected to be RPL
   routers and expected to support this specification.  If a non-RPL
   router receives a packet with a RPI-6LoRH, this means that there was
   a routing error and the packet should be dropped so the Type cannot
   be ignored.

   Since the I flag is not set, the TSE field does not need to be a
   length expressed in bytes.  The field is fully reused for control
   bits so as to encode the O, R and F flags from the RPI, and the I and
   K flags that indicate the compression that is taking place.

   The Type for the RPI-6LoRH is 5.

   The RPI-6LoRH is immediately followed by the RPLInstanceID field,
   unless that field is fully elided, and then the SenderRank, which is
   either compressed into one byte or fully in-lined as the whole 2
   bytes.  The I and K flags in the RPI-6LoRH indicate whether the
   RPLInstanceID is elided and/or the SenderRank is compressed and
   depending on these bits, the Length of the RPI-6LoRH may vary as
   described hereafter.

       0                   1                   2
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

         If it is set, the Instance ID is elided and the RPLInstanceID
         is the Global RPLInstanceID 0.  If it is not set, the octet
         immediately following the type field contains the RPLInstanceID
         as specified in [RFC6550] section 5.1.

   K bit:
         If it is set, the SenderRank is be compressed into one octet,
         and the lowest significant octet is elided.  If it is not set,
         the SenderRank, is fully inlined as 2 octets.

   In Figure 9, the RPLInstanceID is the Global RPLInstanceID 0, and the
   MinHopRankIncrease is a multiple of 256 so the least significant byte
   is all zeros and can be elided:

       0                   1                   2

   In Figure 10, the RPLInstanceID is the Global RPLInstanceID 0, but
   both bytes of the SenderRank are significant so it can not be
   compressed:

                   Figure 10: Eliding the RPLInstanceID.

   In Figure 11, the RPLInstanceID is not the Global RPLInstanceID 0,
   and the MinHopRankIncrease is a multiple of 256:

       0                   1                   2                   3

7.  The IP-in-IP 6LoRH

   The IP-in-IP 6LoRH (IPinIP-6LoRH) is an Elective 6LoWPAN Routing
   Header that provides a compressed form for the encapsulating IPv6
   Header in the case of an IP-in-IP encapsulation.

   An IP-in-IP encapsulation is used to insert a field such as a Routing
   Header or an RPI at a router that is not the source of the packet.
   In order to send an error back regarding the inserted field, the
   address of the router that performs the insertion must be provided.

   The encapsulation can also enable the last router prior to
   Destination to remove a field such as the RPI, but this can be done
   in the compressed form by removing the RPI-6LoRH, so an IPinIP-6LoRH
   encapsulation is not required for that sole purpose.

   This field is not critical for routing so the Type can be ignored,
   and the TSE field contains the Length in bytes.

     0                   1                   2
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-       ...      -+
    |1|0|1| Length  | 6LoRH Type 6  |  Hop Limit    | Encaps. Address  |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-       ...      -+


                       Figure 13: The IPinIP-6LoRH.

   The Length of an IPinIP-6LoRH is expressed in bytes and MUST be at
   least 1, to indicate a Hop Limit (HL), that is decremented at each
   hop.  When the HL reaches 0, the packet is dropped per [RFC2460]

   If the Length of an IPinIP-6LoRH is exactly 1, then the Encapsulator
   Address is elided, which means that the Encapsulator is a well-known
   router, for instance the root in a RPL graph.





Thubert, et al.           Expires July 17, 2016                [Page 14]

Internet-Draft6LoWPAN Routing Header And Paging Dispatches  January 2016


   If the Length of an IPinIP-6LoRH is strictly more than 1, then an
   Encapsulator Address is placed in a compressed form after the Hop
   Limit field.  The value of the Length indicates which compression is
   performed on the Encapsulator Address.  For instance, a Size of 3
   indicates that the Encapsulator Address is compressed to 2 bytes.

   When it cannot be elided, the destination IP address of the IP-in-IP
   header is transported in a RH3-6LoRH as the first address of the
   list.

   With RPL, the destination address in the IP-in-IP header is
   implicitly the root in the RPL graph for packets going upwards, and
   the destination address in the IPHC for packets going downwards.  If
   the implicit value is correct, the destination IP address of the IP-
   in-IP encapsulation can be elided.

   If the final destination of the packet is a leaf that does not
   support this specification, then the chain of 6LoRH must be stripped
   by the RPL/6LR router to which the leaf is attached.  In that
   example, the destination IP address of the IP-in-IP header cannot be
   elided.

   In the special case where the 6LoRH is used to route 6LoWPAN
   fragments, the destination address is not accessible in the IPHC on
   all fragments and can be elided only for the first fragment and for
   packets going upwards.

8.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC4944], [RFC6282], and [RFC6553]
   apply.

   Using a compressed format as opposed to the full in-line format is
   logically equivalent and does not create an opening for a new threat
   when compared to [RFC6550], [RFC6553] and [RFC6554].

9.  IANA Considerations

   This specification reserves the Dispatch Value Bit Patterns of
   10xxxxxx within the 6LoWPAN Dispatch Page 1.

Appendix A.  Examples

   The example in Figure 14 illustrates the 6LoRH compression of a
   classical packet in Storing Mode in all directions, as well as in
   non-Storing mode for a packet going up the DODAG following the
   default route to the root.  In this particular example, a
   fragmentation process takes place per [RFC4944], and the fragment
   headers must be placed in Page 0 before switching to Page 1:

 +-  ...  -+-  ...  -+-+ ... -+-+ ... -+- ... +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+- ...
 |Frag type|Frag hdr |11110001| IPinIP |  RPI   | Dispatch + LOWPAN_IPHC
 |RFC 4944 |RFC 4944 | Page 1 | 6LoRH  | 6LoRH  | RFC 6282
 +-  ...  -+-  ...  -+-+ ... -+-+ ... -+- ... +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+- ...
                                                 <-      RFC 6282     ->
                                                     No RPL artifact


              Figure 14: Example Compressed Packet with RPI.

   The example illustrated in Figure 15 is a classical packet in non-
   Storing mode for a packet going down the DODAG following a source
   routed path from the root; in this particular example, addresses in
   the DODAG are assigned to share a same /112 prefix, for instance
   taken from a /64 subnet with the first 6 octets of the suffix set to
   a constant such as all zeroes.  In that case, all addresses but the
   first can be compressed to 2 octets, which means that there will be 2

   RH3_6LoRH headers, one to store the first complete address and the
   one to store the sequence of addresses compressed to 2 octets (in
   this example, 3 of them):

 +- ...  -+- ...  -+-+-+- ... -+-+-+-+-+ ... -+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+- ...
 |11110001| IPinIP | RH3(128bits)| RH3(3*16bits)| Dispatch + LOWPAN_IPHC
 |Page 1  | 6LoRH  | 6LoRH       | 6LoRH        | RFC 6282
 +- ...  -+- ... +-+-+-+- ... -+-+-+-+-+ ... -+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+- ...
                                                 <-      RFC 6282     ->
                                                     No RPL artifact


              Figure 15: Example Compressed Packet with RH3.

   Note: the RPI is not represented since most implementations actually
   refrain from placing it in a source routed packet though [RFC6550]
   generally expects it.
