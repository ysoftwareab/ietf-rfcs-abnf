Internet-Draft                IP MCAST MIB                    March 2007


1.  Introduction

   This MIB describes objects used for managing IP multicast function,
   including IP multicast routing.  These objects are independent of the
   specific multicast routing protocol in use.  Managed objects specific
   to particular multicast protocols are defined elsewhere.

2.  History

   This document obsoletes [RFC2932].  The MIB module defined by this
   document is a re-working of the MIB module from [RFC2932], with
   changes that include the following.

   o  This MIB module includes support for IPv6 addressing and the IPv6
      scoped address architecture.  [RFC2932] supported only IPv4.

   o  This MIB module allows several multicast protocols to perform
      routing on a single interface, where [RFC2932] assumed each
      interface supported at most one multicast routing protocol.
      Multicast routing protocols are now per-route, see
      ipMcastRouteProtocol.

   o  This MIB module includes objects that are not specific to
      multicast routing.  It allows management of multicast function on
      systems that do not perform routing, whereas [RFC2932] was
      restricted to multicast routing.

   o  This MIB module includes a table of Source-Specific Multicast
      (SSM) address ranges to which SSM semantics [RFC3569] should be
      applied.

   o  This MIB module includes a table of local applications that are
      receiving multicast data.

   o  This MIB module includes a table of multicast scope zones.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally

Internet-Draft                IP MCAST MIB                    March 2007


   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   ([RFC2578], [RFC2579] and [RFC2580]).

4.  Overview

   This MIB module contains two scalars and eight tables.  The tables
   are:

   1.  The IP Multicast Interface Table, which contains multicast
       information specific to interfaces.

   2.  The IP Multicast SSM Range Table, which contains one row per
       range of multicast group addresses to which Source-Specific
       Multicast semantics [RFC3569] should be applied.

   3.  The IP Multicast Route Table, which contains multicast routing
       information for IP datagrams sent by particular sources to the IP
       multicast groups known to a system.

   4.  The IP Multicast Routing Next Hop Table, which contains
       information about next-hops for the routing of IP multicast
       datagrams.  Each entry is one of a list of next-hops on outgoing
       interfaces for particular sources sending to a particular
       multicast group address.

   5.  The IP Multicast Scope Boundary Table, which contains the
       boundaries configured for multicast scopes [RFC2365].

   6.  The IP Multicast Scope Name Table, which contains human-readable
       names for multicast scopes.

   7.  The IP Multicast Local Listener Table, which contains identifiers
       for local applications that are receiving multicast data.

   8.  The IP Multicast Zone Table, which contains an entry for each
       scope zone known to a system, and maps each zone to the multicast
       address range that is the corresponding scope.

   This MIB module uses textual conventions defined in the IF-MIB
   [RFC4293], the INET-ADDRESS-MIB [RFC4001] and the IANA-RTPROTO-MIB.

            SSM range.  The InetAddressType is given by
            ipMcastSsmRangeAddressType.

            This address object is only significant up to
            ipMcastSsmRangePrefixLength bits.  The remainder of the
            address bits are zero.  This is especially important for
            this index field, which is part of the index of this entry.
            Any non-zero bits would signify an entirely different
            entry.

            For IPv6 SSM address ranges, only ranges prefixed by
            FF3x::/16 are permitted, where 'x' is a valid IPv6 RFC 4291
            multicast address scope.  The syntax of the address range is
            given by RFC 3306 sections 4 and 7.

            For addresses of type ipv4z or ipv6z, the appended zone
            index is significant even though it lies beyond the prefix
            length.  The use of these address types indicate that this
            SSM range entry applies only within the given zone.  Zone
            index zero is not valid in this table.

            If non-global scope SSM range entries are present, then
            consistent ipMcastBoundaryTable entries are required on
            routers at the zone boundary."

6.  Security Considerations

6.1  SNMPv2

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secured (for example by using IPSec),
   there is still no control over whom on the secure network is allowed
   to access (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to access (read/change/create/delete) them.

6.2  Writeable objects

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  This
   section discusses and lists these elements.

   Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some
   network environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

   In this MIB module, possible effects that can be induced by SET
   operations on writeable objects include:

   o  Modifications to multicast routing behavior that prevent or
      disrupt services provided by the network, including (but not
      limited to) multicast data traffic delivery.





McWalter, et al.        Expires September 2, 2007              [Page 47]

Internet-Draft                IP MCAST MIB                    March 2007


   o  Modifications to multicast routing behavior that allow
      interception or subversion of information that is carried by the
      network.  For example, attacks can be envisaged that would pass
      nominated multicast data streams through a nominated location,
      without the sources or listeners becoming aware of this
      subversion.

   The following are the read-write and read-create objects defined in
   this MIB module.

   ipMcastEnable
   ipMcastInterfaceTtl
   ipMcastInterfaceRateLimit
   ipMcastSsmRangeRowStatus
   ipMcastSsmRangeStorageType
   ipMcastBoundaryStatus
   ipMcastBoundaryStorageType
   ipMcastScopeNameTable
   ipMcastScopeNameString
   ipMcastScopeNameDefault
   ipMcastScopeNameStatus
   ipMcastScopeNameStorageType

6.3  Readable objects

   As well as the writeable objects discussed above, there are a number
   of readable objects (i.e., objects with a MAX-ACCESS other than not-
   accessible) that may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some
   network environments.  It is thus important to control even GET
   and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt
   the values of these objects when sending them over the network via
   SNMP.

   In this MIB module, possible effects that can be induced by GET
   and/or NOTIFY operations include:

   o  Determination of the topology, disposition, and composition of the
      network.  This information may be commercially sensitive, and may
      also be used in preparation for attacks, including any of the
      attacks described above.

   o  Determinion of whether multicast data is flowing in the network,
      or has flowed recently, as well as the locations of senders and
      recipients.  An attacker can apply 'traffic analysis' to this
      data.  In some cases, the information revealed by traffic analyses
      can be as damaging as full knowledge of the data being
      transported.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IP-MCAST-MIB should be rooted under the mib-2 subtree.  IANA is
   requested to assign { mib-2 XXX } to the IP-MCAST-MIB module
