1. Introduction

  This document defines a content feature schema that is a profile of
  the media feature registration mechanisms [1,2,3] for use in
  performing capability identification between extended Internet fax
  systems [5].

  This document does not describe any specific mechanisms for
  communicating capability information, but does presume that any
  such mechanisms will transfer textual values.  It specifies a
  textual format to be used for describing Internet fax capability
  information.

  The range of capabilities that can be indicated are based on those
  defined for Group 3 facsimile [6].  A companion document [4]


McIntyre/Klyne             Work-in-progress                   [Page 2]

RFC nnnn       Content feature schema for Internet fax  September 1998


  describes the relationship and mapping between this schema and
  Group 3 fax capabilities.

1.1 Organization of this document

  Section 2 specifies the overall syntax for fax feature descriptions
  by reference to the media feature registration and syntax documents
  [1,2].

  Section 3 enumerates the feature tags that MUST be recognized and
  processed by extended Internet fax systems, according to their
  capabilities.

  Appendix A contains additional feature tag registrations for media
  features that are specific to fax and for which no applicable
  registration already exists.  These are presented in the form
  prescribed by the media feature registration procedure [1].

1.2 Terminology and document conventions

  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
  "SHOULD", SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
  document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

  The term "eifax system" is used to describe any software, device or
  combination of these that conforms to the specification "Extended
  Facsimile Using Internet Mail" [5].

       NOTE:  Comments like this provide additional nonessential
       information about the rationale behind this document.
       Such information is not needed for building a conformant
       implementation, but may help those who wish to understand
       the design in greater depth.

1.3 Revision history

  00a  28-Sep-1998  Initial draft.

1.4 Unfinished business

  .  Review terminology (especially eifax).

  .  Finalize feature set

  .  Supply examples

  .  Supply new feature registrations

2. Fax feature schema syntax

  The syntax for the fax feature schema is described by "An algebra
  for describing media feature sets" [2].  This in turn calls upon
  media feature tags that may be registered according to the
  procedure described in "Media Feature Tag Registration Procedure"
  [1].

       ??Note:  The document name for [2] will change to "A
       syntax for describing media feature sets".

       Note:  Media feature registration provides a base
       vocabulary of features that correspond to media handling
       capabilities.  The feature set syntax provides a
       mechanism and format for combining these to describe
       combinations of features that may be handled by eifax
       systems.

3. Internet fax feature tags

  This section enumerates and briefly describes the feature tags that
  MUST be recognized and processed by eifax systems and for which a
  value SHOULD be offered in any capability announcement, according
  to their capabilities.

  That is, a number of feature tags are presented below that an eifax
  system is expected to be able to recognize its ability or non-
  ability to handle.

  Definitive descriptions of feature tags are indicated by reference
  to their registration per the 'conneg' registration procedure (some
  of which are appended to this document)

       NOTE:  The presence of a feature tag in this list does
       not mean that an eifax system must have that capability;
       rather, it must recognize the feature tag and relate it
       to the capabilities that it does have.

       Further, an eifax system is not prevented from
       recognizing and offering additional feature tags.  The
       list below is intended to provide a minimum vocabulary
       which all eifax systems can use in a consistent fashion.

3.1 Image Size

  Feature tag name    Legal values
  ----------------    ------------
  pix-x               <Integer> (>0)
  pix-y               <Integer> (>0)

  under discussion: should we use pixels or some physical unit of
  measure?]]]

  Feature tag name    Legal values
  ----------------    ------------
  dpi                 <Integer> (>0)

  [[[There may be some conflict or interaction between this and
  'image size' above.]]]

       NOTE: a bi-level (i.e. black-and-white only) fax image or
       capability is indicated by the feature value 'grey=2'.
       This is indicates the rendering capabilities of a
