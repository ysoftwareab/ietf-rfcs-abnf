1.  Introduction

   Standards development frequently requires collaboration between
   competitors.  Cooperation among competitors can spark concerns about
   antitrust law or competition law violations (antitrust law and
   competition law are used here synonymously).  Certain actions taken
   by a company that holds a dominant market position can similarly
   spark concerns about competition law violations.  This document
   provides guidance for IETF participants about how to reduce antitrust
   risks in connection with IETF activities.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Legal Compliance

   The IETF does not provide legal advice to participants, and instead
   encourages participants to obtain independent legal advice as needed.
   This document does not contain legal advice.

   All IETF participants must behave lawfully when engaged in IETF
   activities, including by following applicable antitrust laws.

4.  Existing BCPs

   Compliance with the BCPs that document the established rules and
   norms of the IETF facilitates compliance with antitrust law, as the
   IETF structure and processes are intended to mitigate antitrust
   risks.  As a reminder, participants are already required to comply
   with the following policies documented in the BCPs:

   *  The Internet Standards Process as described in BCP 9 [BCP9], which
      is designed to "provide a fair, open, and objective basis for
      developing, evaluating, and adopting Internet Standards," and
      provides robust procedural rules, including an appeals process.

   *  The Working Group Guidelines and Procedures described in BCP 25
      [BCP25], which emphasize requirements for "open and fair
      participation and for thorough consideration of technical
      alternatives," and describe IETF's consensus-based decision-making
      processes.

   *  The IETF framework that participants engage in their individual
      capacity, not as company representatives, and "use their best
      engineering judgment to find the best solution for the whole
      Internet, not just the best solution for any particular network,
      technology, vendor, or user," as described in BCP 54 [BCP54].

   *  The IETF's intellectual property rights policies as set forth in
      BCP 78 [BCP78] and BCP 79 [BCP79]; these policies are carefully
      designed to "benefit the Internet community and the public at
      large, while respecting the legitimate rights of others."

   *  The established conflict of interest policies, such as the IESG
      Conflict of Interest Policy, the IAB Conflict of Interest Policy
      or the IETF LLC Conflict of Interest Policy, if and when
      applicable.

5.  Recommended Behavior

   As the IETF is a standards development environment where
   representatives from competitors are highly likely to be present,
   participants should not discuss the following topics:

   *  product pricing

   *  profit margins

   *  business relationships between specific vendors and customers

   *  details of particular supply chains

Internet-Draft          IETF Antitrust Guidelines            August 2021


   *  specific market opportunities

   *  employee compensation or benefits

   While not all discussions of these topics would necessarily be
   antitrust violations, prudence suggests that avoiding these topics
   altogether best mitigates antitrust risks.

   In addition to avoiding specific topics of discussion, IETF
   participants, particularly those in an IETF leadership position,
   should not engage in the following:

   *  behavior that may be considered abuse of a dominant position

   *  behavior that amounts to an agreement to restrain marketplace
      competition.

6.  Escalation of antitrust-related concerns

   Participants should report potential antitrust concerns in the
   context of IETF activities to through the following channels: IETF
   Chair (chair@ietf.org), the IETF LLC executive director (exec-
   director@ietf.org), the IETF legal counsel (legal@ietf.org), or via
   the IETF LLC whistleblower service.

7.  IANA Considerations

   No values are assigned in this document, no registries are created,
   and there is no action assigned to the IANA by this document.

8.  Security Considerations

   This document may be considered to document means to avoid risks to
   the IETF and IETF participants related to antitrust.  One may
   consider those to be security considerations.  Other than that, this
   document introduces no known security aspects to the IETF or IETF
   participants.
