       security architecture for 6top: requirements and structure
            draft-richardson-6tisch-security-architecture-00

Abstract

   This document details minimal layer-2 requirements for 6top use in
   industrial settings, and a few options for accomplishing this.  The
   layer-2 mechanism is then extended to provide for per-node
   authentication and authorization of the node/PCE communications.
   This internet-draft is intended for later inclusion into the 6tisch
   architecture document.
