1.  Introduction

   SM2 [GBT.32918.1-2016] [I-D.shen-sm2-ecdsa], SM3 [GBT.32905-2016]
   [I-D.shen-sm3-hash] and kM4 [GBT.32907-2016] [I-D.ribose-cfrg-sm4]
   are cryptographic standards issued by the Organization of State

   This document utilizes definitions of operations from [RFC7253] and
   are included here for reference.

   c^i

      The integer c raised to the i-th power.

   S || T

      String S concatenated with string T (e.g., 000 || 111 == 000111).

4.  SM2 Algorithms

   SM2 is an elliptic curve based cryptosystem (ECC) [GBT.32918.1-2016]
   [I-D.shen-sm2-ecdsa] designed by Xiaoyun Wang et al. and published by
   [OSCCA].

   It was first published by the OSCCA in public in 2010 [OSCCA-SM2],
   then standardized as [GMT-0003-2012] in 2012, included in
   [ISO.IEC.11889] in 2015, published as a Chinese National Standard as
   [GBT.32918.1-2016], and published in [ISO.IEC.14888-3] in 2017.

   The SM2 cryptosystem is composed of three distinct algorithms:

   o  an elliptical curve digital signature algorithm ("SM2DSA")
      [GBT.32918.2-2016] [ISO.IEC.14888-3] [SM2-2], also described in
      [I-D.shen-sm2-ecdsa];

   o  a key exchange protocol ("SM2KEP") [GBT.32918.3-2016]; and

   o  a public key encryption algorithm ("SM2PKE") [GBT.32918.4-2016].

   This document refers to the SM2DSA and SM2PKE algorithms for the
   usage of OpenPGP [RFC4880].

   [GMT-0009-2012] provides specifications on interoperable usage of SM2
   data formats, and they are adhered to within within this document.

4.1.  SM2 Digital Signature Algorithm

   The SM2 Digital Signature Algorithm is intended for digital signature
   and verifications in commercial cryptographic applications,
   including, but not limited to:

   o  identity authentication




Tse, et al.               Expires May 17, 2018                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft        OSCCA Extensions for OpenPGP         November 2017


   o  protection of data integrity

   o  verification of data authenticity

   The process of digital signature signing and verification along with
   their examples are found in [GBT.32918.2-2016], [ISO.IEC.14888-3],
   [SM2-2], and also described in [I-D.shen-sm2-ecdsa].

   The SM2DSA process requires usage of a hash function within.  For
   OSCCA-compliant usage, a OSCCA-compliant hash function such as SM3
   [GBT.32905-2016] *MUST* also be used.

   Formal security proofs for SM2 are provided in [SM2-SigSecurity]
   indicating that it satisfies both EUF-CMA security and security
   against generalized strong key substitution attacks.

   The SM2DSA algorithm has been cryptanalyzed by multiple parties with
   the current strongest attack being nonce [SM2-DSA-Nonces]
   [SM2-DSA-Nonces2] and lattice attacks [SM2-DSA-Lattice].

   In terms of OpenPGP usage, SM2DSA is an alternative to the ECDSA
   algorithm specified in [RFC6637].

   For OpenPGP compatibility, these additional requirements *MUST* be
   adhered to:

   o  SM2DSA allows use of an optional "user identity" string which is
      hashed into "ZA" (Section 3.5 of [SM2-2] and Section 5.1.4.4 of
      [I-D.shen-sm2-ecdsa]).  In OpenPGP, the user identifier "IDA"
      *MUST* be the empty string.

   o  While SM2DSA usually signs "H(ZA || msg)" (Section 4.1 of
      [SM2-2]), this document follows the OpenPGP convention of
      [RFC6637] of not directly signing the raw message "msg", but its
      hash "H(msg)".  Therefore when a message is signed by SM2DSA in
      OpenPGP, the algorithm *MUST* sign the content of "H(ZA ||
      H(msg))" instead of "H(ZA || msg)".  Both hash algorithms used
      here *MUST* be identical.

4.2.  SM2 Key Exchange Protocol

   The SM2 Key Exchange Protocol is used for cryptographic key exchange,
   allowing the negotiation and exchange of a session key within two to
   three message transfers.

   The process of key exchange and verification along with their
   examples are found in [GBT.32918.3-2016] [SM2-3], and also described
   in [I-D.shen-sm2-ecdsa].

Internet-Draft        OSCCA Extensions for OpenPGP         November 2017


   SM2KEP is not used with OpenPGP as it is a two- to three- pass key
   exchange mechanism, while in OpenPGP, public keys of recipients are
   available initially.

   The SM2KEP is now considered insecure due to [SM2-KEP-Comments],
   similar in status to the Unified Model and MQV schemes described in
   [NIST.SP.800-56Ar2].

4.3.  SM2 Public Key Encryption

   The SM2 Public Key Encryption algorithm is an elliptic curve based
   asymmetric encryption algorithm.  It is used for cryptographic
   encryption and decryption, allowing the message sender to utilize the
   public key of the message receiver to encrypt the message, with the
   recipient decrypting the messaging using his private key.

   The full description of SM2PKE is provided in [GBT.32918.4-2016].

   It utilizes a public key size of 512 bits and private key size of 256
   bits [GBT.32918.4-2016] [GMT-0003-2012].

   The process of encryption and decryption, along with their examples
   are found in [GBT.32918.4-2016] and [SM2-4].

   The SM2PKE process requires usage of a hash function within.  For
   OSCCA-compliant usage, a OSCCA-compliant hash function such as SM3
   [GBT.32905-2016] *MUST* also be used.

   In OpenPGP, SM2PKE is an alternative to RSA specified in [RFC4880].

4.4.  Recommended SM2 Curve

   The recommended curve is specified in [GBT.32918.5-2017] [SM2-5] and
   provided here for reference.  SM2 uses a 256-bit elliptic curve.

4.4.1.  Definitions

   p

   a, b

      elements of F_q, defines an elliptic curve E on F_q

4.5.  Data Formats

   [GMT-0009-2012] defines a number of data formats for the SM2
   algorithm to allow interoperable implementations.  This document
   adheres to these conventions.

4.5.1.  Secret Key Data Format

   SM2PrivateKey ::= INTEGER

   SM2 public key data format is described in ASN.1 as [GMT-0009-2012]:

   SM2PublicKey ::= BIT STRING

   Where:

   o  "SM2PublicKey" is of type "BIT STRING" and with content "04 | X |
      Y".

      *  "X" and "Y" specifies the x- and y-coordinates of the public
         key, each of 256-bits long.

4.5.2.  Encrypted Data Format

   The SM2 encrypted data format is provided by [GMT-0009-2012] as the
   following in ASN.1 format:

   SM2Cipher ::= SEQENCE{
     XCoordinate     INTEGER,                -- x-coordinate
     YCoordinate     INTEGER,                -- y-coordinate
     HASH            OCTET STRING SIZE(32),  -- hash value
     CipherText      OCTET STRING            -- ciphertext
   }

   Where:

   o  "XCoordinate" and "YCoordinate" are x- and y-coordinates on the
      elliptic curve, both 256 bits long.

   o  "HASH" is the hash value calculated from the hash function used in
      "KDF" of a fixed bit length of 256-bits.

   o  "CipherText" is of same length as its plaintext.

4.5.3.  Signature Data Format

   SM2 signature data format is described in ASN.1 as [GMT-0009-2012]:

   SM2Signature ::= SEQUENCE{
     R   INTEGER,  -- first portion of signature
     S   INTEGER   -- second portion of signature
   }

   "R" and "S" represent the first and second portion of the signature,
   and both are 256 bits long.

5.  SM3 Hash Algorithm

   The SM3 Cryptographic Hash Algorithm [GBT.32905-2016] is an iterative
   hash function designed by Xiaoyun Wang et al., published by [OSCCA]
   as an alternative to SHA-2 [NIST.FIPS.180-4].

   It was first published by the OSCCA in public in 2010 [SM3], then
   published in the OSCCA standard [GMT-0004-2012] in 2012, published as
   a Chinese National Standard as [GBT.32905-2016] in 2016, and included
   in the [ISO.IEC.10118-3] standard in 2017.

Internet-Draft        OSCCA Extensions for OpenPGP         November 2017


   The algorithm is designed to be used for commercial cryptographic
   applications including, but not limited to:

   o  digital signatures and their verification

   o  message authentication code generation and their verification

   o  generation of random numbers

   SM3 has a Merkle-Damgard construction and is similar to SHA-2
   [NIST.FIPS.180-4] of the MD4 [RFC6150] family, with the addition of
   several strengthening features including a more complex step function
   and stronger message dependency than SHA-256 [SM3-Boomerang].

   SM3 produces an output hash value of 256 bits long, based on 512-bit
   input message blocks [GBT.32905-2016], on input lengths up to 2^(m).

   The specification of SM3 is described in [GBT.32905-2016], [SM3] and
   [I-D.shen-sm3-hash].

6.  SM4 Symmetric Encryption Algorithm

   SM4 [GBT.32907-2016] [I-D.ribose-cfrg-sm4] [ISO.IEC.18033-3.AMD2]
   [GMT-0002-2012] [SM4] is a symmetric encryption algorithm designed by
   Shuwang Lu et al. originally intended for the usage of wireless local
   area network (Wireless LAN) products.

   SM4 is a 128-bit blockcipher, uses a key size of 128 bits and
   internally uses an 8-bit S-box.  It performs 32 rounds per block.
   Decryption is achieved by reversing the order of encryption.

   SMS4 was first published in public as part of WAPI (Wired
   Authentication and Privacy Infrastructure), the Chinese National
   Standard for Wireless LAN [GB.15629.11-2003].  It was then published
   independently by the OSCCA in 2006 [SM4], formally renamed to SM4 in
   2012 [GMT-0002-2012], published as a Chinese National Standard in
   2016 [GBT.32907-2016], and included in [ISO.IEC.18033-3.AMD2] in
   2017.

   It is a required encryption algorithm specified in WAPI
   [GB.15629.11-2003].

8.  Conversion Primitives

   The encoding method of [RFC6637] Section 6 *MUST* be used, and is
   compatible with the definition given in [SEC1].

   For clarity, according to the EC curve MPI encoding method of
   [RFC6637], the exact size of the MPI payload for the "SM2
   Recommended" 256-bit curve [GBT.32918.5-2017], is 515 bits.

9.  SM2 Key Derivation Function

   A key derivation function (KDF) is necessary to implement EC
   encryption.

   The SM2PKE KDF is defined in Section 3.4.3 of [GBT.32918.4-2016] (and
   Section 5.4.3 of [I-D.shen-sm2-ecdsa], Section 3.4.3 of [SM2-4]).

   For OSCCA-compliance, it *SHOULD* be used in conjunction with an
   OSCCA-approved hash algorithm, such as SM3 [GBT.32905-2016].

   The SM2PKE KDF is equivalent to the KDF2 function defined in
   Section 13.2 of [IEEE.1363a.2004] given the following assignments:

   o  Parameter

      *  v as hBits, the output length of the selected hash function
         Hash

   o  Input

      *  KEYLEN as oBits

      *  Z as the plaintext string; and

      *  PB is set to the empty bit string.

   Pseudocode of the SM2KDF function is provided here for convenience.
   This function contains edited variable names for clarity.

9.1.  Prerequisites

   o  Hash(S) is a hash function that outputs a v-bit long hash value
      based on input S.

   o  MSB(b, S) is a function that outputs the b most significant bits
      of the bitstream S.

   o  Floor(r) and Ceil(r) are the floor and ceiling functions
      respectively for the input of real number r.  Both functions
      outputs an integer.

9.2.  Inputs

   KEYLEN

      Desired key length.  A positive integer less than (2^32 - 1) x v.

   Z

      Plaintext.  String of any length.

9.3.  Outputs

   K

      Generated key.  String of length KEYLEN.

   K is defined as follows.

   _____________________________________________________________________

   Counter = 1                  // a 32-bit counter
   n = KEYLEN / v

   for each 1 <= i <= Ceil(n)
     Ha_i = Hash( Z || Counter )
     Counter = Counter + 1
   end for

   if n is a whole number then
     Ha! = Ha_{Ceil(n)}
   else
     Ha! = MSB(KEYLEN - (v x Floor(n)), Ha_{Ceil(n)})
   end if

   K = Ha_1 || Ha_2 || ... || Ha_{Ceil(n)-1} || Ha!

10.  Encoding of Public and Private Keys

10.1.  Public-Key Packet Formats

   The following algorithm-specific packets are added to Section 5.5.2
   of [RFC4880], "Public-Key Packet Formats", to support SM2DSA and
   SM2PKE.

Internet-Draft        OSCCA Extensions for OpenPGP         November 2017


   This document extends the algorithm-specific portion with the
   following fields.

   Algorithm-Specific Fields for SM2DSA keys:

   o  a variable-length field containing a curve OID, formatted as
      follows:

      *  a one-octet size of the following field; values 0 and 0xFF are
         reserved for future extensions

      *  octets representing a curve OID, described in Section 12

   o  MPI of an EC point representing a public key

   Algorithm-Specific Fields for SM2PKE keys:

   o  a variable-length field containing a curve OID, formatted as
      follows:

      *  a one-octet size of the following field; values 0 and 0xFF are
         reserved for future extensions

      *  octets representing a curve OID, described in Section 12

   o  MPI of an EC point representing a public key

   Note that both SM2DSA and SM2PKE public keys are composed of the same
   sequence of fields, and use the same codepoint to identify them.
   They are distinguished by the key usage flags.

10.2.  Secret-Key Packet Formats

   The following algorithm-specific packets are added to Section 5.5.3.
   of [RFC4880], "Secret-Key Packet Formats", to support SM2DSA and
   SM2PKE.

   This document extends the algorithm-specific portion with the
   following fields.

   Algorithm-Specific Fields for SM2DSA or SM2PKE secret keys:

   o  an MPI of an integer representing the secret key, which is a
      scalar of the public EC point

11.  Message Encoding with Public Keys

11.1.  Public-Key Encrypted Session Key Packets (Tag 1)

   Section 5.1 of [RFC4880], "Public-Key Encrypted Session Key Packets
   (Tag 1)" is extended to support SM2PKE using the following algorithm
   specific fields for SM2PKE, through applying the KDF described in
   Section 9.

   Algorithm Specific Fields for SM2 encryption:

   o  The SM2 ciphertext is formatted in the OpenPGP bitstream as a
      single MPI.  This consists of:

      *  The data format described in Section 4.5.2 containing data
         provided by [GBT.32918.4-2016] Section 6.1 step A8 ("C = (C1 ||
         C3 || C2)"), followed by

      *  a single octet giving the code for the hash algorithm used
         within the calculation of the KDF mask "t" (step A5 of
         [GBT.32918.4-2016] Section 6.1) and the calculation of "C3"
         (step A7 of [GBT.32918.4-2016] Section 6.1).  For OSCCA
         compliance, this *MUST* be an OSCCA-approved hash function, and
         in any case, it *SHOULD* be a hash which is listed in the
         receiving keys "Preferred Hash Algorithms" list
         (Section 5.2.3.8 of [RFC4880]).

11.2.  Signature Packet (Tag 2)

11.2.1.  Version 3 Signature Packet Format

   Section 5.2.2 of [RFC4880] defines the signature format for "Version
   3 Signature Packet Format".  Similar to ECDSA [RFC6637], no change in
   the format is necessary for SM2DSA.

11.2.2.  Version 4 Signature Packet Format

   Section 5.2.3 of [RFC4880] defines the signature format for "Version
   4 Signature Packet Format".  Similar to ECDSA [RFC6637], no change in
   the format is necessary for SM2DSA.

12.  SM2 ECC Curve OID

   This section provides the curve ASN.1 Object Identifier (OID) of the
   "SM2 Recommended Curve" [GBT.32918.5-2017] described in Section 4,
   according to the method of [RFC6637].





Tse, et al.               Expires May 17, 2018                 [Page 15]

Internet-Draft        OSCCA Extensions for OpenPGP         November 2017


   We specify the curve OID of the "SM2 Recommended Curve" to be the
   registered OID entry of "SM2 Elliptic Curve Cryptography" according
   to [GMT-0006-2012], which is "1.2.156.10197.1.301".

   The table below specifies the exact sequence of bytes of the
   mentioned curve:

   +---------------------+--------+--------------------+---------------+
   | ASN.1 OID           | OID    | Curve OID bytes in | Curve name    |
   |                     | len    | hex                |               |
   +---------------------+--------+--------------------+---------------+
   | 1.2.156.10197.1.301 | 8      | 2A 81 1C CF 55 01  | SM2           |
   |                     |        | 82 2D              | Recommended   |
   +---------------------+--------+--------------------+---------------+

   The complete ASN.1 DER encoding for the SM2 Recommended curve OID is
   "06 08 2A 81 1C CF 55 01 82 2D", from which the first entry in the
   table above is constructed by omitting the first two octets.  Only
   the truncated sequence of octets is the valid representation of a
   curve OID.

13.  Compatibility Profiles

13.1.  OSCCA SM234 Profile

   The "OSCCA SM234" profile is designed to be compliant to OSCCA
   regulations.  A compliant OpenPGP implementation *MUST* implement the
   following items as described by this document:

   o  SM2 Recommended Curve (Section 12)

   o  SM2 (SM2DSA and SM2PKE) (Section 4)

      *  The hash function selected in SM2DSA and SM2PKE *MUST* also be
         OSCCA-compliant, such as SM3 [SM3]

   o  SM3 (Section 5)

   o  SM4 (Section 6)

14.  Security Considerations

   o  Products and services that utilize cryptography are regulated by
      the OSCCA [OSCCA]; they must be explicitly approved or certified
      by the OSCCA before being allowed to be sold or used in China.

   o  SM2 [GBT.32918.1-2016] is an elliptic curve cryptosystem (ECC)
      approved by the OSCCA [OSCCA].  Its security relies on the



Tse, et al.               Expires May 17, 2018                 [Page 16]

Internet-Draft        OSCCA Extensions for OpenPGP         November 2017


      assumption that the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem
      (ECLP) is computationally infeasible.  With advances in
      cryptanalysis, new attack algorithms may reduce the complexity of
      ECLP, making it easier to attack the SM2 cryptosystem that is
      considered secure at the time this document is published.  You
      *SHOULD* check current literature to determine if the algorithms
      in SM2 have been found vulnerable.

   o  There are security concerns with regards to side-channel attacks
      against ECCs, including template attacks (such as [SM2-Template])
      that rely on physical access to the computation device.  An
      implementer of ECC systems *SHOULD* be aware of potential
      vulnerabilities in this regard.

   o  SM3 [GBT.32905-2016] is a cryptographic hash algorithm approved by
      the OSCCA [OSCCA].  No formal proof of security is provided.  As
      claimed in [I-D.shen-sm3-hash], the security properties of SM3 are
      under public study.  There are no known feasible attacks against
      the SM3 algorithm at the time this document is published.

   o  SM4 [GBT.32907-2016] is a blockcipher approved by the OSCCA
      [OSCCA].  Security considerations of SM4 offered in
      [I-D.ribose-cfrg-sm4] apply.  No formal proof of security is
      provided but there are no known feasible attacks against the SM4
      algorithm by the time of publishing this document.

      There are, however, security concerns with regards to side-channel
      attacks, when the SM4 algorithm is implemented in a device
      [SM4-Power].  For instance, [SM4-Power] illustrated an attack by
      measuring the power consumption of the device.  A chosen
      ciphertext attack, assuming a fixed correlation between the sub-
      keys and data mask, is able to recover the round key successfully.
      When the SM4 algorithm is implemented in hardware, the parameters/
      keys *SHOULD* be randomly generated without fixed correlation.

   o  SM2 has a key length of 512 bits for the public key and 256 bits
      for the private key.  It is considered an alternative to ECDSA
      P-256 [RFC6637].  Its security strength is comparable to a 128-bit
      symmetric key strength [I-D.ietf-msec-mikey-ecc], e.g., AES-128
      [NIST.FIPS.197].

   o  SM3 is a hash function that generates a 256-bit hash value.  It is
      considered as an alternative to SHA-256 [RFC6234].

   o  SM4 is a blockcipher symmetric algorithm with a key length of 128
      bits.  It is considered as an alternative to AES-128
      [NIST.FIPS.197].

   o  Security considerations offered in [RFC6637] and [RFC4880] also
      apply.

15.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA "Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)" registry [RFC8126] has made the
   following assignments for algorithms described in this document,
   namely:

   o  ID XXX of the "Public Key Algorithms" namespace for SM2 Section 4

   o  ID XXX of the "Hash Algorithms" namespace for SM3 Section 5

   o  ID XXX of the "Symmetric Key Algorithms" namespace for SM4
      Section 6
