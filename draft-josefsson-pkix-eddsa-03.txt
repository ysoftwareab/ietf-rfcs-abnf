1.  Introduction

   In [Ed25519], an elliptic curve signature system EdDSA was
   introduced, and a recommended choice of curve Ed25519 is chosen.
   EdDSA and Ed25519 was designed with performance and security in mind.
   Specification, test vectors and a sample implementation is available
   in [I-D.josefsson-eddsa-ed25519].

   This RFC defines ASN.1 object identifiers for EdDSA for use in the
   Internet X.509 PKI [RFC5280], and parameters for Ed25519.  This
   document serves a similar role as [RFC3279] does for RSA (and more),
   [RFC4055] for RSA-OAEP/PSS, and [RFC5758] for SHA2-based (EC)DSA.

2.  Requirements Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Subject Public Key Information Fields

   In the X.509 certificate, the subjectPublicKeyInfo field has the
   SubjectPublicKeyInfo type, which has the following ASN.1 syntax:

Internet-Draft             PKIX OIDs for EdDSA            September 2015


        SubjectPublicKeyInfo  ::=  SEQUENCE  {
          algorithm         AlgorithmIdentifier,
          subjectPublicKey  BIT STRING
        }

   The fields in SubjectPublicKeyInfo have the following meanings:

   o  algorithm is the algorithm identifier and parameters for the
      public key (see below).

   o  subjectPublicKey is the EdDSA public key.

   The AlgorithmIdentifier type, which is included for convenience, is
   defined as follows:

         AlgorithmIdentifier  ::=  SEQUENCE  {
           algorithm   OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
           parameters  ANY DEFINED BY algorithm OPTIONAL
         }

   The fields in AlgorithmIdentifier have the following meanings:

   o  algorithm identifies the cryptographic algorithm with an object
      identifier.  This is the EdDSA OID defined below.

   o  parameters, which are optional, are the associated parameters for
      the algorithm identifier in the algorithm field.

4.  EdDSA Public Keys

   Certificates conforming to [RFC5280] may convey a public key for any
   public key algorithm.  The certificate indicates the algorithm
   through an algorithm identifier.  This algorithm identifier is an OID
   and optionally associated parameters.

   This section identify the OID and parameters for the EdDSA algorithm.
   Conforming CAs MUST use the identified OIDs when issuing certificates
   containing EdDSA public keys.  Conforming applications supporting
   EdDSA MUST, at a minimum, recognize the OID identified in this
   section.

   The id-EdDSAPublicKey OID is used for identifying EdDSA public keys.

          id-EdDSAPublicKey OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 1.3.101.100 }

   The id-EdDSAPublicKey OID is intended to be used in the algorithm
   field of a value of type AlgorithmIdentifier.

Internet-Draft             PKIX OIDs for EdDSA            September 2015


   EdDSA public keys use the parameter field to specify the particular
   instantiation of EdDSA parameters.  The parameters field have the
   ASN.1 type EdDSAParameters as follows.

       EdDSAParameters ::= ENUMERATED { ed25519 (1),
                                        sha512-ed25519 (2) }

   The EdDSAParameters enumeration may be extended in the future.

   The value 'ed25519' means the set of "pure" EdDSA parameters
   associated with Ed25519, including internal hash function (SHA512)
   and curve.  The value 'sha512-ed25519' means that the SHA512
   algorithm will be used as the prehash parameter and the hash function
   for the signature.  For the definitions see [EdDSA-prehash].

   The raw binary EdDSA public key is encoded directly in the
   subjectPublicKey BIT STRING object.  Note that unlike some other
   schemes, there is no additional OCTET STRING encoding step.

5.  Key Usage Bits

   The intended application for the key MAY be indicated in the keyUsage
   certificate extension.

   If the keyUsage extension is present in an end-entity certificate
   that conveys an EdDSA public key with the id-EdDSAPublicKey object
   identifier, then the keyUsage extension MUST contain one or both of
   the following values:

          nonRepudiation; and
          digitalSignature.

   If the keyUsage extension is present in a certification authority
   certificate that conveys an EdDSA public key with the id-
   EdDSAPublicKey object identifier, then the keyUsage extension MUST
   contain one or more of the following values:

          nonRepudiation;
          digitalSignature;
          keyCertSign; and
          cRLSign.

6.  EdDSA Signatures

   Certificates and CRLs conforming to [RFC5280] may be signed with any
   public key signature algorithm.  The certificate or CRL indicates the
   algorithm through an algorithm identifier which appears in the
   signatureAlgorithm field within the Certificate or CertificateList.

Internet-Draft             PKIX OIDs for EdDSA            September 2015


   This algorithm identifier is an OID and has optionally associated
   parameters.  For illustration the Certificate structure is reproduced
   here:

      Certificate  ::=  SEQUENCE  {
           tbsCertificate       TBSCertificate,
           signatureAlgorithm   AlgorithmIdentifier,
           signatureValue       BIT STRING  }

   Recall the definition of the AlgorithmIdentifier type:

         AlgorithmIdentifier  ::=  SEQUENCE  {
           algorithm   OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
           parameters  ANY DEFINED BY algorithm OPTIONAL
         }

   This document identify an AlgorithmIdentifier OID for EdDSA
   signatures.  No parameters are defined.  The EdDSA parameters follow
   from the public-key parameters.

   The data to be signed is prepared for EdDSA.  Then, a private key
   operation is performed to generate the signature value.  This value
   is the opaque value ENC(R) || ENC'(S) described in section 4.3 of
   [I-D.josefsson-eddsa-ed25519].  This signature value is then ASN.1
   encoded as a BIT STRING and included in the Certificate or
   CertificateList in the signatureValue field.

   The id-EdDSASignature OID is used for identifying EdDSA signatures.

          id-EdDSASignature OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 1.3.101.101 }

   The id-EdDSASignature OID is intended to be used in the algorithm
   field of a value of type AlgorithmIdentifier.  The parameters field
   MUST be absent.  To further clarify how to encode the parameters
   field, due to historical misunderstandings in this area, it MUST NOT
   have an ASN.1 type NULL.

7.  Human Readable Algorithm Names

   For the purpose of consistent cross-implementation naming this
   section establish human readable names for the algorithms specified
   in this document.  Implementations SHOULD use these names when
   referring to the algorithms.  If there is a strong reason to deviate
   from these names -- for example, if the implementation has a
   different naming convention and wants to maintain internal
   consistency -- it is encouraged to deviate as little as possible from
   the names given here.  For example, if a naming convention is to not

   use hyphen ("-") then instead of "SHA512-Ed25519" the string
   "SHA512Ed25519" could be used.

   Use the string "EdDSA" when referring to a public key or signature
   when the parameter set is not known or relevant.

   When the EdDSAParameters value is known, use a more specific string.
   For the ed25519(1) value use the string "Ed25519".  For the
   sha512-ed25519(2) value use the string "SHA512-Ed25519".

   certificates, illustrating parameter choices.

10.  IANA Considerations

   None.

11.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC5280] and
   [I-D.josefsson-eddsa-ed25519] apply accordingly.

   A common misconception may be that a Ed25519 public key can be used
   to create SHA512-Ed25519 signatures, or vice versa.  This leads to
   cross-key attacks, and is not permitted.
