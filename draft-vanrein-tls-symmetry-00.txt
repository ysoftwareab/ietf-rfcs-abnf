                 Symmetry for Transport Layer Security
                     draft-vanrein-tls-symmetry-00

Abstract

   TLS connections can be run over various transports, and can in turn
   carry many application protocols.  All current transports and at
   least some application protocols are capable of running between
   symmetric end points, in what could be called peer-to-peer mode, but
   the use of TLS introduces a requirement to always assign a client and
   server role, thus enforcing asymmetry and complicating symmetric
   peer-to-peer protocols.  This specification defines a TLS Extension
   to remedy that stringency of TLS.

1.  Introduction

   TLS secures many application protocols, some of which can be run
   symmetrically between peers, possibly after discovery through a
   mechanism such as mDNS.  The introduction of TLS as a security layer
   underneath application protocols enforces the assignment of
   asymmetric client and server roles, something that not all protocols
   were designed to negotiate.  Examples of application protocols that
   do not suggest client and server roles for end points include XMPP
   and SIP in peer-to-peer mode, or some uses of the symmetric MSRP
   protocol.  In addition, there are many non-standard protocols that
   have been designed to operate symmetrically from the ground up
   because they are meant for peer-to-peer operation.

   TLS can be carried over transports UDP, TCP and SCTP, sometimes in
   the DTLS variation.  It is commonly understood that UDP can be
   initiated from either or both sides, but it is less well-known that
   TCP and SCTP may also connect between two active end points; in this
   situation both end points initiate the connection, and as a result of
   network communication delays these attempts cross midway.  And
   indeed, this is even a practically possible situation when one or
   both end points have a known address, for instance as a result of
   prior exchange of transparent addresses.  Furthermore, firewalls and
   other middle boxes tend to faithfully implement the TCP state
   diagrams [Figure 6 of [RFC0793]] that enable this connection setup
   between two active end points.  Lacking an obvious active and passive
   side for at least some transport connections means that this is not

   always available as a tie-breaker to assign TLS client and TLS server
   rolese.

   The need to authenticate a remote peer may help to decide which side
   must play the role of client, and which is to be the server.  But in
   situations with mutual authentication using a more-or-less symmetric
   CipherSuite, this last reason for asymmetric client/server role
   separation may also be unsuitable.

   This specification introduces a TLS Extension that can be used to
   indicate that the client/server role assignment is open for
   negotiation as part of the TLS handshake.  This is helpful for those
   situations where these roles cannot be derived from the context, as
   described above.  It can also be used by a TLS server that wants to
   actively initiate a connection to a TLS client, and even by a TLS end
   point that wants to open a hole in its local firewall.

   The protocol flow then allows both end points to send a ClientHello
   containing the new TLS Extension, and based on a tie-breaker value in
   that extension each party reaches the same conclusion on which TLS
   end point continues as a client, and which continues as a server.
   The following figure demonstrates how the resulting TLS flow looks.

2.  The role_preference TLS Extension

   The role_preference extension carries a byte sequence of at least 1
   byte and at most 32 bytes in its extension_data field; each of the
   bytes must have a value of at least 33 and no more than 126; this
   makes the byte sequences suitable for treatment as case-sensitive
   ASCII strings; it should however be noted that these strings have no
   terminating NUL character.

   These role_preference values may be compared on a byte-by-byte basis
   to determine whether one is ordered before another.  The first byte
   value that differs determines which of the strings is ordered before



Van Rein                  Expires March 7, 2016                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                TLS Symmetry                September 2015


   the other; and if one string equals the other but has additional
   bytes then the shorter is ordered before the longer one.  When one
   role_preference values is exactly the same as another, they are said
   to be ordered as equals.  When one role_preference value is neither
   ordered before, nor as an equal to another, then the one is said to
   be ordered after the other.

   An easy way to remember these ordering rules is that "client" is
   ordered before "server"; and this hints at the intention: if one
   role_preference value is ordered before another, then the party who
   sent the one value should take on the role of TLS client, whereas the
   party that sent the other value should take on the role of TLS
   server.  When two role_preference are ordered as equals then the
   surrounding TLS handshake fails, on grounds of not being able to
   establish a client/server role distinction, which should be reported
   through a handshake_failure alert.

3.  Procedures

   This section defines procedures for sending ClientHello and
   processing the reception of one.

3.1.  Sending ClientHello with role_preference

   A ClientHello with the role_preference extension may be sent once by
   each of the peers, as the initiation of a TLS handshake.  The order
   in which the sides send this extension is arbitrary.  It is only
   possible to send a ClientHello with the role_preference as the first
   record in a TLS handshake, either on a fresh connection or during
   (secure) renegotiation.

   It is considered an error condition when both sides send a
   ClientHello but not both incorporate the role_preference extension.
   This situation MUST result in a handshake_error alert, and may be the
   cause for a new attempt over a new connection.  A more conservative
   approach would be for a TLS end point to wait for a ClientHello from
   the remote end point and see if the extension is present; this can
   work if the remote TLS end point is known to be able to act as a
   client.  Context, historic behaviour and the application protocol can
   all be helpful determine the most useful approach here.

   The role_preference value comprising of a single byte valued 33 will
   never have a value ordered before it; this can be sent to require a
   client role.  The role_preference value comprising of 32 bytes, all
   valued 126, will never have a value ordered after it; this can be
   sent to require a server role.  When both sides require the same
   role, a handshake_error alert will be the result.

   When a TLS end point is neutral about its role as a client or a
   server, it can send any value in between, and it should send a random
   value to achieve a high probabily of being compatible with any remote
   TLS end point.  The probability of running into a random value from
   the remote that happens to be the same will be negligable for long
   enough extension values.

   Other details in the ClientHello, such as a Server Name Indication
   and listed CipherSuites, SHALL be representative only of a potential
   client role; the TLS end point that ends up in the server role will
   send a ServerHello with new information.

3.2.  Receiving ClientHello with role_preference

   When a ClientHello with the role_preference extension is received and
   a ClientHello has not been sent yet, then a ClientHello with the
   role_preference must still be sent.  Only TLS implementations or
   configurations that do not support the role_preference extension
   would not send this ClientHello.

   After a ClientHello with role_preference is both sent and received,
   their values can be ordered.  When the extension value sent is
   ordered before the extension value received, the local side will
   continue as a TLS client and the ClientHello sent continues as the
   ClientHello record for the TLS handshake, whereas the ClientHello
   received is strikken from the TLS handshake.  When the extension
   value sent is ordered after the extension value received, the local
   side will continue as a TLS server and the received ClientHello
   continues as the ClientHello record for the TLS Handshake, whereas
   the ClientHello sent is strikken from the TLS handshake.  When the
   extension values sent and received are ordered as equals, a
   handshake_error alert is locally processed as though it had been
   received over the TLS connection.

   When a ClientHello mesage is strikken from the TLS handshake, the
   following can be said:

   o  All the information contained in the strikken ClientHello message
      is forgotten.

   o  The random material in the strikken ClientHello message is
      therefore also dropped; the same random material may however be
      used in the ServerHello, since that is sent by the same party and
      because it impacts further security mechanisms in the same manner.

   o  The strikken ClientHello message has no security impact; even the
      selection of the role is not a security matter, since that is
      already customarily done outside the protected scope of TLS.  As a

      result, the strikken ClientHello message is not taken into account
      when constructing the handshake_messages for the Finished message
      [Section 7.4.9 of [RFC5246]] or other messages.  In other words,
      the handshake_messages are formed from the traditional sequence
      ClientHello, ServerHello, ...

3.3.  Not Receiving ClientHello with role_preference

   When a ClientHello with the role_preference extension has been sent,
   but the remote TLS end point respondes with a ClientHello without
   role_preference extension, then a handshake_error alert MUST be
   raised, as the handshake procedure was not properly adapted to this
   specification.

   When a ClientHello with the role_preference extension has been sent,
   but the remote TLS end point responds with a ServerHello, it is clear
   that no ClientHello is to be expected.  The conclusion is then that
   the remote TLS end point does not implement the role_preference
   extension.  In this case, the handshake continues as it would have
   without the role_preference extension; the TLS end point that sent
   the ClientHello continues as a client and the TLS end point that
   responded with a ServerHello continues as a server.

   As an exception to the last paragraph, there is the situation where
   the role_preference was set to require a server role.  In this case,
   a ServerHello response from the remote TLS end point SHOULD be
   considered an error, and will raise the handshake_error alert.  Note
   that this is actually a new use case, where a server sends a
   ClientHello and expects the other side to initiate a client
   connection on its initiative; this is not part of the usual TLS flow,
   so it does not dismantle any of the normal TLS usage patterns.

3.4.  Sending ServerHello

   When one of the TLS end points has been selected to fulfil the server
   role, it will send the usual ServerHello.  ServerHello messages MUST
   NOT include the role_preference extension, as this has already been
   acknowledged in the ClientHello response preceeding the ServerHello.

   In fact, the ServerHello and all follow-up messages conform to the
   existing TLS procedures.  Only when renegotiating TLS with a new
   handshake will the possibility of change of roles come up again.

4.  Configuring TLS for Symmetric Behaviour

   The role_preference extension MUST NOT be sent by default by a
   general TLS implementation.  Only when it is implemented with the
   possibility of symmetric peers in mind, or when it is explicitly



Van Rein                  Expires March 7, 2016                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                TLS Symmetry                September 2015


   configured to permit this mode of operation, SHOULD the
   role_preference extension be sent.

   Most current applications of TLS are aware of client and server
   roles, and will specify their authentication and encryption
   requirements in those terms.  For example, it is often assumed that a
   client does not offer authentication, but that a server will
   authenticate to the client.  The client thereby becomes the
   responsible party to detect man-in-the-middle attacks, because the
   server cannot distinguish an honest client from a rogue one.  Note
   that this protocol flow is asymmetric, and as a result so is its
   configuration.

   When welcoming both client and server roles, the TLS implementation
   conceals the actual client and server role assignment, and the
   application using it will be considered as a symmetric peer.  This
   has an impact on the configuration, which must now speak in terms of
   local and remote configuration, instead of in terms of client and
   server configuration.  Not all CipherSuites are equally suited for
   this mode of operation, but use cases that require mutual
   authentication are reasonably well-supported, and are also the most
   likely for symmetric peer-to-peer applications of TLS.

   During renegotiation of the handshake, the roles of client and server
   may be swapped.  This process is asynchronous to the application-
   level protocol, and MUST NOT be permitted by default, unless it is
   explicitly configured from code that is aware of the application
   protocol's assumptions.

   TLS implementations that can end up being either a client or a server
   SHOULD permit separate configuration of the various parameters that
   are negotiated during the ClientHello, ServerHello handshake.  They
   should permit separate CipherSuite lists for the two roles, for
   instance, and their use of Server Name Indications and other
   extensions may also differ between the two roles.

5.  Efficiency Considerations

   The TLS changes specified here introduce one more message to the TLS
   handshake.  When this message is generated asynchronously, there is
   no need for an extra roundtrip, as both sides simply start sending it
   as soon as the connection comes up.  Whether this is safe depends in
   part on the application protocol; symmetric peer-to-peer protocols
   will often be able to assume support for the extension.

   When the extension is negotiated by a side that defaults to the
   client role, then a side that defaults to the server role would await
   it and be required to send the additional ClientHello in its response



Van Rein                  Expires March 7, 2016                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                TLS Symmetry                September 2015


   to indicate support for the role_preference extension.  If this
   response lets the sides take on their default roles, then no extra
   roundtrip is required because the additional ClientHello can be sent
   together with the ServerHello that immediately follows it.  If the
   response switches sides, then half a roundtrip is added, as the sides
   switch their roles.  The added flexbility of making this switch may
   be considered sufficiently valuable to invest this half roundtrip
   time.

   The generated random values for the role_preference extension need
   not be cryptographically secure values; they merely exist as a tie-
   breaker in the client/role appointment.  This can be achieved with a
   lower quality random number generator, which can be implemented more
   efficiently than a secure random number generator.

6.  Privacy Considerations

   The ClientHello sent by the server provides additional information,
   such as the CipherSuites acceptable to the server when it ends up in
   client mode, and extension information such as a Server Name
   Indication.

7.  Security Considerations

   This specification introduces more dynamicity to TLS, and that is
   automatically a concern.  The additional flexibility is not advised
   as a default mode of operation for general TLS implementations, to
   avoid interfering with the assumptions made by applications about
   strict client/server behaviour of TLS.

   Applications that are aware of their potential to be either a TLS
   client or a TLS server should be mindful, and select separate
   configuration settings for each role.  It may be helpful to permit
   configuration to take place in terms of requirements of
   authenticating the remote end.  And, just as any TLS configuration
   should take the possibility of NULL CipherSuites into account, it
   should also be aware of the impact of the various CipherSuites on the
   two roles to be played.

   In a symmetric peer-to-peer application, it makes some sense to
   consider both the client and server role, and setup for each
   separately.  This work is otherwise done separately on each end, but
   symmetric peer-to-peer protocols tend to connect in both directions
   and therefore already require both configurations to be defined.
   This has not changed; what has changed is that the application is not
   necessarily aware of which applies.

Internet-Draft                TLS Symmetry                September 2015


   Having said that, most TLS implementations will not conceal the
   chosen role completely, because many application protocols need to
   know about it.

   A concern that TLS end points must be aware of when permitting
   changes of role, is that there may sometimes be a reason to
   renegotiate the handshake, in which case the client has a decisive
   role, whereas the server can only ask the client.  Whether this could
   be problematic is an application-level decision to be taken into
   account before enabling the role_preference extension.

   It is also worth noting that the renegotiation provides an
   opportunity for change of the appointment of client and server roles.
   This may happen in a manner that is asynchronous to the application-
   layer protocol.  This may or may not be a desired effect, which is
   why it is recommended as an explicit option to configure, defaulting
   towards the conservative option of not permitting a change of the
   roles.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This specification defines a TLS extension, to be registered by IANA
   in the TLS Extensions Registry, ExtensionType Values subregistry.
   The Extension Name to be used is role_preference.
