1.  Introduction

   Several protocols for protecting DNS traffic with encrypted
   transports have been defined, such as DNS-over-TLS (DoT) [RFC7858]
   and DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) [RFC8484].  Encrypted DNS can provide many
   security and privacy benefits for network clients.

   While it is possible for clients to hard-code encrypted DNS resolvers
   to use, dynamic discovery and provisioning of encrypted resolvers can
   expand the usefulness and applicability of encrypted DNS to many more
   use cases.

   The Adaptive DNS Discovery (ADD) Working Group is chartered to define
   mechanisms that allow clients to automatically discover and select
   encrypted DNS resolvers in a wide variety of network environments.
   This document describes several use cases for discovering DNS
   resolvers that support encrypted transports, and lists requirements
   that any proposed discovery and selection mechanisms should address.
   They can do this either by providing a solution, or by explicitly
   stating why it is not in scope.

   Use cases are described between Section 3 and Section 4.2.  Each use
   case contains a narrative and a set of requirements that apply in
   that case.  There are additional common requirements in Section 5.
   Each requirement is identified as "Ra.b" where a is the group number
   and b is the number within that group.  Both a and b are integers
   starting with 1.

   A summary of all requirements in listed in Section 6.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Terminology

   This document makes use of the following terms.

   Encrypted DNS: DNS-over-HTTPS [RFC8484], DNS-over-TLS [RFC7858], or
   any other encrypted DNS technology that the IETF may publish, such as
   DNS-over-QUIC [I-D.ietf-dprive-dnsoquic].

   Associated resolver: A resolver operated by the same entity that
   provides the resolver the client started with.  See Section 3.

Internet-Draft                   ADDREQ                   September 2020


   Equivalent associated resolver: An associated resolver that provides
   DNS responses that are identical to the ones served by the original
   unencrypted resolver.

   Alternative associated resolver: An associated resolver that serves
   different responses to some queries; see Section 3 for examples.

3.  Discovery of associated resolvers

   A client may begin with information about unencrypted resolvers from
   the attached networks (Section 3.1), and/or unencrypted resolvers
   known from configuration (Section 3.2).  This information may be used
   to then discover one or more associated encrypted resolvers.

   Associated resolvers are defined as resolvers operated by the same
   entity that provides the resolver the client started with.  Such
   associated resolvers may come in two forms:

   1.  Equivalent - these provide DNS responses that are identical to
       the ones served by the unencrypted resolver.

   2.  Alternative - these serve different responses to some queries.
       For example one entity may offer a set of encrypted resolvers
       with different levels of filtering (none, just malware, or
       malware & adult content), or different proximity (local or
       central).

   The client may wish to select an equivalent associated resolver, or
   select one of the alternatives.

   Designs for resolver upgrade mechanisms can either add new parameters
   to existing provisioning mechanisms (for example, adding necessary
   information to use DoT or DoH to options in DHCP, RAs, or IKEv2) or
   else provide a way to communicate with a provisioned unencrypted DNS
   resolver and discover the associated encrypted DNS resolvers.

                                 Table 1

3.1.  Network-provisioned resolvers

   DNS servers are often provisioned by a network as part of DHCP
   options [RFC2132], IPv6 Router Advertisement (RA) options [RFC8106],
   Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [RFC1877], 3GPP Protocol Configuration
   Options, or another mechanism.  Historically this is usually one or
   more DNS resolver IP addresses, to be used for traditional
   unencrypted DNS.  However it could also be a richer set of
   information.

   Using an encrypted and authenticated resolver that is associated to
   the one provisioned by the network can provide several benefits that
   are not possible if only unencrypted DNS is used:

   *  Prevent other devices on the network from observing client DNS
      messages

   *  Verify that answers come from the selected DNS resolver

   *  Authenticate that the DNS resolver is the one provisioned by the
      network

   Frequently, network-provisioned resolvers are forwarders running on a
   local router.  The discovered encrypted resolvers in these cases may
   either be local forwarders themselves, or an associated resolver that
   is in the network (thus bypassing the router's DNS forwarder).

3.1.1.  Unencrypted forwarder

   If the resolver announced by the network is a classic unencrypted
   forwarder, it is frequently the case that such forwarders are
   difficult to upgrade to support encrypted operation.  In such cases
   it is useful for the resolver provider to be able to declare which
   encrypted resolvers they provide, and for the client to be able to
   discover them.  If the client wishes to, it can then use one of those
   resolvers and bypass the local forwarder.

                   +=============+=====================+
                   | Requirement | Description         |
                   +=============+=====================+

                   +-------------+---------------------+

                                  Table 3

3.1.2.  Encrypted forwarder

   If a subset of local resolvers supports encrypted DNS, the client may
   not initially be aware that its local resolver supports it.
   Discovering this may require communication with the local resolver,
   or an upstream resolver, over an unencrypted transport.  Once
   discovered, the local encrypted forwarder may be selected by the
   client, gaining the benefits of encryption while retaining the
   benefits of a local caching forwarder with knowledge of the local
   topology.

   Another benefit occurs with IoT devices.  A common usage pattern for
   such devices is for it to "call home" to a service that resides on
   the public Internet, where that service is referenced through a
   domain name (A or AAAA record).  As discussed in Manufacturer Usage
   Description Specification [RFC8520], because these devices tend to
   require access to very few sites, all other access should be
   considered suspect.  However, if the query is not accessible for
   inspection, it becomes quite difficult for the infrastructure to
   suspect anything.

3.2.  Client-selected resolvers

   Client devices often allow the device administrator to select a
   specific DNS resolver to use on certain networks, or on all networks.
   Historically, this selection was specified only with an IP address.

   Discovering which equivalent encrypted resolvers are offered by the
   same entity allows the client to "upgrade" connections to use
   encrypted DNS.  This can provide several benefits:

   *  Prevent devices along the network path to the selected resolver
      from observing client DNS messages

   *  Verify that answers come from the selected DNS resolver

   *  Authenticate that the DNS resolver is the one selected by the
      client

   In doing so it is critical that the new resolver is an equivalent
   resolver.  Switching to a non-equivalent alternative resolver would
   break the expectation of the user who previously selected that
   resolver.

                                  Table 5

3.3.  VPN resolvers

   Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) also can provision DNS resolvers.  In
   addition to being able to use DHCP or RAs, VPNs can provision DNS
   information in an explicit configuration message.  For example, IKEv2
   can provision DNS servers using Configuration Attributes [RFC7296].

   VPNs can also configure Split DNS rules to limit the use of the
   configured resolvers to specific domain names [RFC8598].

   Discovering an encrypted resolver that is provisioned by a VPN can
   provide the same benefits as doing so for a local network, but
   applied to the private network.  When using Split DNS, it becomes
   possible to use one encrypted resolver for private domains, and
   another for other domains.

                                  Table 6

4.  Discovery of limited domain resolvers

   Similar to how VPN DNS configurations can use Split DNS for private
   names, other network environments can support resolution of names
   that are specific to the local environment.  For example, an
   enterprise-managed Wi-Fi network might be able to access both the
   Internet and a private intranet.  In such a scenario, the private
   domains managed by the enterprise might only be resolvable using a
   specific DNS resolver.

   Discovering an encrypted resolver for a subset of names allows a
   client to perform Split DNS while maintaining the benefits of
   encrypted DNS.  For example, a client could use a client-selected
   encrypted resolver for public domains, but use a different encrypted
   resolver for enterprise-private domains.

   Such domain-specific resolver discovery mechanisms additionally need
   to provide some information about the applicability and capabilities
   of encrypted resolvers.  This information can either be provisioned
   or can be discovered based on clients actively trying to access
   content.

4.1.1.  Encrypted resolvers for local or home content

   Accessing locally-hosted content can require the use of a specific
   resolver.  For example, captive networks or networks with walled-
   garden content like media on airplane Wi-Fi networks can rely on
   using a resolver hosted on the local network.

   In cases where a client is using an encrypted resolver provisioned by
   a network, and that encrypted resolver is able to resolve names of
   local content, this can fall into the use case described in
   Section 3.1.  However, it might be necessary to discover a local
   encrypted resolver along with specific domains if:

   *  the network-provisioned encrypted resolver is not able to resolve
      local-only names, or

   *  the client has a more-preferred encrypted resolver for generic
      traffic, and would otherwise not be able to access local content

   The first point can occur in a hybrid deployment, e.g. when the local
   resolver is unencrypted but a central one is encrypted.  Clients
   choosing the encrypted resolver for most queries will need to be
   advised to refer to the local one for some names.

   This case also include accessing content specific to a home network.

4.1.3.  Private enterprise names

   As stated above, an enterprise-managed Wi-Fi network might be able to
   access both the Internet and a private intranet.  The private domains
   managed by the enterprise might only be resolvable using a specific
   DNS resolver, hence use of that resolver is essential for such
   domains.  However it does not necessarily mean that all queries for
   all domains have to flow through that resolver.

   Only sending the necessary queries through the enterprise resolver,
   and not generic Internet queries, has the privacy benefit of only
   exposing traffic to the enterprise that fall within a limited set of
   domains.

   Using encrypted DNS for private names also opens up the possibility
   of doing private name resolution outside of the content of a VPN or
   managed network.  If the DNS resolver authenticates clients, it can
   offer its resolver for private names on a publicly accessible server,
   while still limiting the visibility of the DNS traffic.

4.2.  Encrypted resolvers for content providers

   Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), and content-providers more broadly,
   can also provide encrypted DNS resolvers that can be used by clients
   over the public Internet.  These resolvers can either allow
   resolution of all public names (like normal recursive resolvers), or
   be designed to serve a subset of names managed by the content
   provider (like an authoritative resolver).  Using these resolvers can
   allow the content provider to directly control how DNS answers are
   used for load balancing and address selection, which could improve
   performance of connections to the content provider.

   Using a content-provider's encrypted resolver can also provide
   several privacy and security benefits:

   *  Prevent devices along the network path to the content-provider's
      resolver from observing client DNS messages

   *  Verify that answers come from the entity that manages the domains
      being resolved

   *  Reduce the number of entities able to monitor the specific names
      accessed by a client to only the client and the content provider,
      assuming that the content provider would already see the names
      upon a secure connection later being made based on the DNS answers
      (e.g., in the TLS SNI extension)

5.  Privacy and security requirements

   Encrypted (and authenticated) DNS improves the privacy and security
   of DNS queries and answers in the presence of malicious attackers.
   Such attackers are assumed to interfere with or otherwise impede DNS
   traffic and corresponding discovery mechanisms.  They may be on-path
   or off-path between the client and entities with which the client
   communicates [RFC3552].  These attackers can inject, tamper, or
   otherwise interfere with traffic as needed.  Given these
   capabilities, an attacker may have a variety of goals, including,
   though not limited to:

   *  Monitor and profile clients by observing unencrypted DNS traffic

   *  Modify unencrypted DNS traffic to filter or augment the user
      experience

   *  Block encrypted DNS

   Clients cannot assume that their network does not have such an
   attacker unless given some means of authenticating or otherwise
   trusting the communication with their DNS resolver.

Internet-Draft                   ADDREQ                   September 2020


   Given this type of attacker, resolver discovery mechanisms must be
   designed carefully to not worsen a client's security or privacy
   posture.  In particular, attackers must not be able to:

   *  Redirect secure DNS traffic to themselves when they would not
      otherwise handle DNS traffic.

   *  Override or interfere with the resolver preferences of a user or
      administrator.

   *  Cause clients to use a discovered resolver which has no
      authenticated delegation from a client-known entity.

   *  Influence automatic discovery mechanisms such that a client uses
      one or more resolvers that are not otherwise involved with
      providing service to the client, such as: a network provider, a
      VPN server, a content provider being accessed, or a server that
      the client has manually configured.

   Beyond these requirements, standards describing resolver discovery
   mechanisms must not place any requirements on clients to select
   particular resolvers over others.

   When discovering DNS resolvers on a local network, clients have no
   mechanism to distinguish between cases where an active attacker with
   the above capabilities is interfering with discovery, and situations
   wherein the network has no encrypted resolver.  Absent such a
   mechanism, an attacker can always succeed in these goals.  Therefore,
   in such circumstances, viable solutions for local DNS resolver
   discovery should consider weaker attackers, such as those with only
   passive eavesdropping capabilities.  It is unknown whether such
   relaxations represent a realistic attacker in practice.  Thus, local
   discovery solutions designed around this threat model may have
   limited value.

5.1.  On opportunistic encryption

   Opportunistic encrypted DNS, when the client cannot authenticate the
   entity that provides encrypted DNS, does not meet the requirements
   laid out here for resolver discovery.  While opportunistic encryption
   can provide some benefits, specifically in reducing the ability for
   other entities to observe traffic, it is not a viable solution
   against an on-path attacker.

   Performing opportunistic encrypted DNS does not require specific
   discovery mechanisms.  Section 4.1 of [RFC7858] already describes how
   to use DNS-over-TLS opportunistically.

5.2.  Handling exceptions and failures

   Even with encrypted DNS resolver discovery in place, clients must be
   prepared to handle certain scenarios where encrypted DNS cannot be
   used.  In these scenarios, clients must consider if it is appropriate
   to fail open by sending the DNS queries without encryption, fail
   closed by not doing so, or presenting a choice to a user or
   administrator.  The exact behavior is a local client policy decision.

   Some networks that use Captive Portals will not allow any Internet
   connectivity until a client has interacted with the portal
   [I-D.ietf-capport-architecture].  If these networks do not use
   encrypted DNS for their own resolution, a client will need to perform
   unencrypted DNS queries in order to get out of captivity.  Many
   operating systems have specific client code responsible for detecting
   and interacting with Captive Portals; these system components may be
   good candidates for failing open, since they do not generally
   represent user traffic.

   Other networks may not allow any use of encrypted DNS, or any use of
   encrypted DNS to resolvers other than a network-provisioned resolver.
   Clients should not silently fail open in these cases, but if these
   networks are trusted by or administered by the user, the user may
   want to specifically follow the network's DNS policy instead of what
   the client would do on an unknown or untrusted network.
