   This document proposes to migrate the MCAST.NET domain into the ARPA
   top level domain that is dedicated to infrastructure support.  It
   also covers migration issues and caveats.

Internet-Draft             Rehoming MCAST.NET               October 2006


1.  Introduction

   Comments should be directed at the author or to the mboned working
   group.

   {This is an early version and thus will not pass the ID nits test.}

1.1.  The ARPA top level domain

   [RFC3172] designates the ARPA top level domain as "Address and
   Routing Parameters Area" to be used for infrastructure applications.

   The mcast.net second level domain fulfills the criteria layed out in
   section 2.1 of [RFC3172].  However, there is no standards track
   document explicitly designating this domain to a multicast group name
   to multicast group address mapping.

   [RFC3171] defines the multicast address assignment policy.


2.  Current Use

   Currently the zone MCAST.NET reflects the contents of the IANA
   multicast address registry.  However, some names are missing from the
   DNS zone and some names used differ from the description that appears
   in the registry file.


3.  Registration Policy

   Names within MCAST.ARPA will consist of one additional label and will
   adhere to the hostname syntax requirements of [RFC1123].  These names
   will own a single A RR, a single AAAA RR, or both.  Addresses will be
   in the IPv4 or IPv6 multicast address space.

3.1.  Names and Addresses eligible for Registration in MCAST.ARPA

   Only IANA multicast address registrations are eligible for being
   listed in MCAST.ARPA.

3.2.  Subdomains of MCAST.ARPA

   There might be subdomains below MCAST.ARPA that serve special
   purposes.


4.  Migration Issues

Internet-Draft             Rehoming MCAST.NET               October 2006


   The current content of the MCAST.NET zone shall be brought in line
   with the multicast address registry.

   Since legacy systems may use MCAST.NET for quite some time, there
   needs to be a mapping/forwarding solution to answer those queries in
   a useful manner without discouraging migration.

   RFCs mentioning MCAST.NET are [RFC3261] and [RFC3678].

   A proposal in [I-D.ietf-mboned-addrdisc-problems] mentions a
   subdomain of MCAST.NET.

4.1.  Migration Strategies

   After the move, several options are available for the future handling
   of MCAST.NET.

4.1.1.  Freeze

   The current MCAST.NET zone could be frozen, so that no additions,
   deletions or changes to the content (apart from those necessary for
   maintenance, e.g.  SOA and NS RRs) would be perfomed.  New
   registrations would only be available in MCAST.ARPA, so this could be
   an incentive for querying clients to alter their behavior as well.

4.1.2.  Phase Out

   MCAST.NET would only see deletions.

4.1.3.  Continue

   MCAST.NET could be further operated in parallel, either by
   operational habit or per DNAME RR.


5.  Security Considerations

   The usual Security Considerations for the DNS apply.

   There is no Security Problem associated with the migration itself.

   MCAST.ARPA. should be signed with DNSSEC as soon as the ARPA domain
   is signed.

   This section needs more work

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes a recommendation to IANA.
