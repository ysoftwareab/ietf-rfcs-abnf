Internet-Draft                  DYMO-low                      March 2007


1.  Introduction

   The IEEE 802.15.4 standard [ieee802.15.4] targets low power personal
   area networks.  The "IPv6 over IEEE 802.15.4" document [I-D.ietf-
   6lowpan-format] defines basic functionality required to carry IPv6
   packets over IEEE 802.15.4 networks (including an adaptation layer,
   header compression, etc).  Likewise, as mesh topologies are expected
   to be common in LoWPAN networks, the functionality required for
   packet delivery in IEEE 802.15.4 meshes is defined.  However, neither
   the IEEE 802.15.4 standard nor the "IPv6 over IEEE 802.15.4"
   specification provide any information as to how such a mesh topology
   could be obtained and maintained.

   This document specifies how to use the Dynamic MANET On-demand
   Routing Protocol (DYMO) [I-D.ietf-manet-dymo] over IEEE 802.15.4
   networks to provide mesh routing.  To distinguish this instantiation
   of the protocol from DYMO over IPv4 and DYMO over IPv6, the label
   "DYMO-low" is used in this document.  Given the very stringent
   limitations of the target devices, this document specifies
   simplifications that are recommended to the base DYMO specification.

1.1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Overview

   The addresses used in DYMO-low control messages are either 16 bit
   link layer short address or IEEE 64-bit extended addresses [EUI64].
   Additionally, it should be noted that as used in this specification,
   DYMO-low is not layered on top of IP, but underneath it.  It is an
   underlay.  As such, it creates a mesh network topology of IEEE
   802.15.4 devices that use single wireless interface each, underneath
   and unbeknownst to IP.  IP sees a PAN as a single link.  This is
   similar to how other technologies regularly create complex structures
   underneath IP (e.g., ethernet spanning tree bridges, token ring
   source routing, ATM, etc).  One can envision a sub-IP mesh creating
   the illusion that all the devices on that PAN are on the same IPv6
   link (sharing the same IPv6 prefix).  At the same time, normal usage
   of DYMO (above IP) could tie together several such "links"
   (potentially using different technologies for each) into a larger
   mesh.

   DYMO makes use of link-local multicast in its route discovery.  It
   does so in order to propagate the Route Request control packets
   (RREQs).  In this specification, such link-local multicast packets



Kim, et al.             Expires September 5, 2007               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                  DYMO-low                      March 2007


   are obtained by setting the PAN id to the link-local multicast PAN
   (0xffff) and by setting the link layer destination address to the
   link-local multicast short address (0xffff).  DYMO-low control
   packets use the encapsulation defined in [I-D.ietf-6lowpan-format].
   All DYMO-low control packets shall use the prot_type value TBD
   (suggested value of 5).  This prot_type is used to send DYMO-low
   messages in a manner similar to how DYMO uses a properly assigned UDP
   port.

2.1.  Simplifications for DYMO over IEEE 802.15.4

   This section specifies simplifications and distinctive features of
   DYMO-low compared to the base DYMO.

   DYMO allows for minimalist implementations by specifying non-
   essential functionality as optional [I-D.ietf-manet-dymo].  In
   keeping with DYMO, DYMO-low implements the routing message(RM) which
   provides both the RREQ (route request) and the RREP (route reply).
   The RERR (route error) message is also implemented.  DYMO-low has the
   following characteristics:

   o  RREQ messages are transmitted as IEEE 802.15.4 link-local
      multicast messages to reach all the next hop neighbors.  DYMO
      packets SHOULD NOT be fragmented.

   o  The generalized packet and message format [I-D.ietf-manet-
      packetbb] is not used in DYMO-low for the limited packet size and
      reducing packet processing complexity.

   o  Only the final destination SHOULD respond to a RREQ by replying
      with a RREP.

   o  Link quality (LQI) of IEEE 802.15.4[ieee802.15.4] in addition to
      the route cost is utilized for selecting best route to the
      destination.

   o  The IEEE 802.15.4 acknowledgement mechanism is used to determine
      if a neighbor is no longer responsive.  This information is
      obtained when transmitting a packet with acknowledgement option
      turned on.

   o  Due to space limitations, nodes SHOULD append only one unreachable
      destination in RERR.

   o  DYMO Sequence numbers allow nodes to judge the freshness of
      routing information and ensure loop freedom.

Internet-Draft                  DYMO-low                      March 2007


   o  The transmission method for RREQ and RERR messages in DYMO is
      link-local multicast.However, considering the energy-constrained
      nature of 6lowpan, some efficient mechanisms other than broadcast
      are necessitated in DYMO-low (TBD).

2.2.  Terminology

   Link Layer Destination Address (LinkLayerDestinationAddress)

      The 16 bit short or EUI-64 link layer address of the destination
      in the MAC layer.  It is also called as the next-hop destination 
      during hop-by-hop forwarding of packets.

   Link Layer Source Address (LinkLayerSourceAddress)

      The 16 bit short or EUI-64 link layer address of the source in 
      the MAC layer.  It is also called as the previous-hop source 
      address during hop-by-hop forwarding of packets.

   Broadcast

      The broadcast in 6lowpan implies the link-local multicast in IEEE
      802.15.4 MAC layer.  This can be done by setting the link layer
      destination field to 0xffff.

   Target Node (TargetNode)

      The TargetNode is the ultimate destination of a message.

   This Node (ThisNode)

      ThisNode corresponds to the node currently performing a 
      calculation or processing a message.

   Unreachable Node (UnreachableNode)

      An UnreachableNode is a node for which ThisNode does not have a
      forwarding route.

   DYMO Sequence Number (SeqNum)

      A DYMO Sequence Number is maintained by each node.  This sequence
      number is used by other nodes to identify the order of routing
      information generated by a node and to ensure loop-free routes.

3.  Data Structures

3.1.  Route Table Entry

   The route table entry is a conceptual data structure.
   Implementations may use any internal representation that conforms to
   the semantics of a route as specified in this document.

   Conceptually, a route table entry has the following fields:

   Route Destination Address (Route.DestAddress)

      The 16 bit short or EUI-64 link layer address of the final
      destination of a route.

   Route Cost (Route.RouteCost)

      Cumulative cost metric used for allowing a node to select an 
      optimum route to the final destination.

   Route Next Hop Address (Route.NextHopAddress)

      The 16 bit short or EUI-64 link layer address of the next-hop 
      node on the path toward the final destination.

   Route Sequence Number (Route.SeqNum)

      The 16 bit short or EUI-64 link layer address of the next-hop 
      node on the path toward the final destination.

   Route.Broken

      A flag indicating whether this Route is broken.  This flag is set
      if the next hop becomes unreachable or in response to processing 
      a RERR.

   In addition to a route table data structure, each route table entry
   may have several timers associated with the information.  The
   detailed timers/timeouts are TBD.

3.2.  DYMO-low Messages

   DYMO-low messages are categorized either as a Routing Message (RM) or
   a Route Error (RERR) message.

3.2.1.  DYMO-low Routing Messages

   Routing Messages (RMs) are used to disseminate routing information.
   A RM can be either a Route Request (RREQ) message or a Route Reply

   HopLimit

      8-bit field that identifies the maximum number of times the message
      is to be retransmitted.

   Target (T-bit)

      1 for the 16-bit address of the TargetNode.
      0 for the EUI-64 address of the TargetNode.

   Originator (O-bit)

      1 for the 16-bit address of the OrigNode.
      0 for the EUI-64 address of the OrigNode.

   Cost Type (CT)

      3-bits of cost type field defines the cost type.  The detailed types
      are TBD.

   Target Route Cost (TRouteCost)

      8-bit field that identifies the routing cost across the number of
      intermediate nodes through which a packet traversed on the route to
      this particular TargetNode.Address.

   RREQ ID

      An identifier that uniquely identifies the particular RREQ when 
      taken in conjunction with the originator.  It serves two purposes,
      i) It allows intermediate nodes to process the RREQ message once 
      and ii) It matches a unique RREP message against unique RREQ in the 
      wake of multiple RREQ generation.

   Target Node Address (TargetNode.Address)

      The node that is the ultimate destination of the message.  In a 
      RREQ the TargetNode is the destination for which a forwarding 
      route does not exist and a route discovery is being performed.  
      In a RREP the TargetNode is the corresponding RREQ's OrigNode.

   Originator Node Address (OrigNode.Address)

      In RREQ message, the OrigNode is the node that generates a RREQ
      message.  In RREP, the OrigNode is the node that replies to RREQ.

4.  Detailed operation

4.1.  DYMO-low Routing Table Operations

4.1.1.  Creating or Updating a Route Table Entry from New Routing
        Information

   While processing a RM, as described in Section 4.2.2, a node checks
   its routing table for an entry to the OrigNode.Address in the RREQ.
   If a valid route exists to TargetNode.Address, the route can be used
   to send any queued data packets and to fulfill any outstanding route
   requests.

Internet-Draft                  DYMO-low                      March 2007


   In the event that no matching entry is found, an entry is created.

   If a matching entry is found, the routing information about
   OrigNode.Address contained in this RM is considered stale if the
   TRouteCost is greater than Route.RouteCost.

   If there exists a route AND the TRouteCost is equal to the
   Route.RouteCost in this RM, the information is not stale, but the
   routing information SHOULD be disregarded and no routing update
   should occur.

   If the information in this RM is stale or disregarded this DYMO-low
   packet MUST be dropped.  If the route information for Originator is
   not stale or disregarded, then the following actions occur to the
   route table entry for OrigNode.Address:

   1. the Route.RouteCost is set to the TRouteCost,

   2. the Route.NextHopAddress is set to the node that transmitted this
   DYMO-low packet (LinkLayerSourceAddress),

   3. if a valid route exists to TargetNode.Address, the route can be 
   used to send any queued data packets and to fulfill any outstanding 
   route requests.

4.2.  Routing message

4.2.1.  Routing message creation

   When a node creates a RREQ or RREP, it MUST create the RM.  It sets
   the OrigNode.Address to its own address.

4.2.2.  Routing message Processing

   After the general DYMO-low message pre-processing (Section 4.5.2),
   the routing message is processed to yield the route cost TRouteCost.
   That is, the route cost TRouteCost is said to be better (or
   equivalently smaller) than or equal to (Route.RouteCost') if the
   following condition holds (Note that the apostrophe refers to
   Route.RouteCost i.e., an already existing route entry in the routing
   table)

   TRouteCost < = Route.RouteCost'

   If a matching entry to the OrigNode.Address in the routing message is
   found in the routing table, the routing information about
   OrigNode.Address contained in this routing message is considered

Internet-Draft                  DYMO-low                      March 2007


   stale if TRouteCost is greater than the Route.RouteCost'.  If the
   information in this routing message is stale or disregarded this
   DYMO-low packet MUST be dropped.

   If there exists a route AND equal the information is not stale, then
   the routing information SHOULD be disregarded and no routing update
   should occur.  If the route information for OrigNode.Address is not
   stale or disregarded,then the following actions occur to the route
   table entry for OrigNode.Address:

   1. the Route.RouteCost is set to the TRouteCost,

   2. the Route.NextHopAddress is set to the node that transmitted this
   DYMO-low packet (LinkLayerSourceAddress),

   If this node is the TargetNode.Address AND the received RM's type is
   RREQ, this node MUST respond with a RREP.  The target node creates a
   new RM as described in Section 4.2.1.  The TargetNode.Address in the
   new RM is set to the OrigNode.Address from the RM currently being
   processed.  The LinkLayerDestinationAddress is set to the
   Route.NextHopAddress for the TargetNode.Address.  Then the new RM
   undergoes post-processing, according to Section 4.5.3.  If this node
   is not the TargetNode.Address, the current RE SHOULD be handled
   according to Section 4.5.4.

4.3.  Route Maintenance

4.3.1.  Monitoring of Active Links

   Before a route can be used for forwarding a packet, it MUST be
   checked to make sure that the route is still valid.  The detailed
   operation of checking is TBD.  A RERR MUST be issued if a data packet
   is received and it cannot be delivered to the next hop.  RERR
   generation is described in Section 4.4.3.  A RERR SHOULD be issued
   after detecting a broken link of an active route to quickly notify
   nodes that a link break occurred and a route or routes are no longer
   available.

4.3.2.  Updating Route Lifetimes

   TBD.

4.3.3.  Route Error Generation

   When a data packet is received for a destination without a valid
   routing table entry, a Route Error (RERR) MUST be generated by this
   node.  A RERR informs the source that the current route is no longer
   available.  In the RERR, the TargetNode.Address field is the address

   of the unreachable node (final destination address) from the data
   packet.  The setting of theL inkLayerDestinationAddress of the RERR
   and the RERR processing at the receiving node are TBD.

4.4.  General DYMO-low Processing

4.4.1.  DYMO-low Processing

   The Routing Message (RM) MUST be processed completely prior to any
   transmissions.  Unless specific message processing requires dropping
   the DYMO-low packet, it is retransmitted after processing, according
   to the method described in Section 4.5.4.

4.4.1.1.  Routing Message Pre-processing

   The RM in a DYMO-low packet undergoes pre-processing before the
   message specific processing occurs.  During pre-processing, the
   HopLimit is decremented by one (1).

4.4.1.2.  Routing Message Post-processing

   If the HopLimit is zero (0) the DYMO-low packet is dropped.  If the
   HopLimit is greater than zero the DYMO-low packet is re-transmitted
   after processing of all messages.  If the HopLimit of Routing Message
   (RM) is zero (0) after processing, it MUST be removed from the DYMO-
   low packet prior to transmission.

4.4.2.  DYMO-low Control Packet Transmission

   DYMO-low packet transmission and re-transmission is controlled by the
   LinkLayerDestinationAddress.  If the LinkLayerDestinationAddress is a
   unicast address, the packet LinkLayerDestinationAddress is replaced
   by the Route.NextHopAddress from a route table lookup for the
   TargetNode.Address.  If a route for the TargetNode.Address is unknown
   or invalid the packet is dropped and a RERR SHOULD be generated.

4.5.  Packet Generation Limits

   To avoid congestion, a node SHOULD NOT transmit more than RATE_LIMIT
   control messages per second.  RREQ packets SHOULD be discarded before
   RREP or RERR packets.

4.6 Sequence Numbers 

   The usage of sequence numbers in DYMO-low follows the base DYMO 
   except the sequence number rollover.

4.6.1  Sequence Number Rollover

   If the sequence number has been assigned to be the largest possible
   number representable as a 8-bit unsigned integer, then the sequence
   number MUST be set to one (1) when incremented.


5.  Configuration Parameters

   Here are some default parameter values for DYMO-low:

         Parameter Name                  Suggested Value
         ---------------------------     ---------------
         NET_DIAMETER                    256
         RATE_LIMIT                      2
         RREQ_WAIT_TIME                  1000 milliseconds
         RREQ_TRIES                      2

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document needs an additional IANA registry for the prot_type
   value that indicates the DYMO-low format.

7.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of the [RFC3561] are applicable to this
   document.  As described in the charter of the 6lowpan w.g., DYMO-low
   will also try to reuse existing security considerations related to Ad
   hoc routing protocols.  Further considerations will be studied in the
   next version.
