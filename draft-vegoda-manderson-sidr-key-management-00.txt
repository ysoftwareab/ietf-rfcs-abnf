1.  Introduction

   Strong key management is central to the security of any hierarchy of
   cryptographic certificates [NISTKEYMANAGEMENT].  The deployment of a
   Global Trust Anchor for the RPKI requires a set of well-defined
   architectural objectives to guide the detailed design work.  This
   document identifies some of the questions that need to be addressed
   in the architectural guidelines for key management.

2.  Terminology

   It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the terms and concepts
   described in "Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate
   and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile" [RFC5280], "A Profile
   for X.509 PKIX Resource Certificates" [RFC6487], and "X.509
   Extensions for IP Addresses and AS Identifiers" [RFC3779].

3.  Definitions

   The Global Trust Anchor (GTA) is the root of the Internet's RPKI
   hierarchy and is responsible for issuing subordinate certificates for
   resources within 0/0 (IPv4), 0::/0 (IPv6), and Autonomous System
   Numbers 0-4294967295.

4.  Algorithm support

4.1.  Algorithm based on jurisdiction

   [RFC6485] requires that RPKI signatures use a SHA-256 hashing
   algorithm and 2048-bit RSA keys.  Some jurisdictions have legal
   impediments to implementing this requirement [RFC5830] [RFC5832],
   resulting in a need to use other cryptographic algorithms.  To
   support RPKI CAs in all jurisdictions, there is therefore a need to
   allow the use of algorithms other than RSA and SHA-256, and so
   validators will need to support these algorithms if they are going to
   successfully validate objects signed with a certificate using a
   signature algorithm other than RSA with a SHA-256 hash.

   Advice is sought on how jurisdictional requirements can be addressed
   in the set of supported algorithms.

4.2.  Algorithm vulnerability

   Published cryptographic algorithms are constantly tested
   [NISTALGORITHMTESTING].  There is a potential that the RSA algorithm
   will be found vulnerable to one or more attacks during the lifetime
   of an RPKI GTA that uses the algorithm.  In order to mitigate this
   risk it is necessary to require support for additional public-key
   cryptographic algorithms in the RPKI so that the operator can roll
   the GTA to one using a different algorithm.

   Advice is sought on how a production GTA can roll the algorithms it
   uses in the event of an effective attack on the RSA algorithm
   becoming available during the production lifetime of the GTA.

5.  Key Length

   The US National Institute of Standards and Technology recommends
   [NISTKEYMANAGEMENT] that 2048-bit RSA keys, as required in [RFC6485],
   should not be used after 2030.  It is common for an X.509 trust
   anchor to have a 15 year or longer lifetime [COMODO] [DIGICERT]
   [ENTRUST] [SYMANTEC].  If an RPKI GTA uses a standard lifetime it
   needs to use a key that is longer than 2048 bits.  Alternatively, the
   key needs to be rolled prior to 2030 and the protocol must be updated
   to support keys that are judged to be safe to use after that date.
   If the key rollover and protocol update is selected, the lead time
   needs to be sufficient to make sure that the entire deployed base is
   upgraded to support the new algorithm of key length.

   Advice is sought on whether the GTA should use a shorter lifetime
   than is typical in X.509 TAs or use a keylength that is considered
   safe beyond 2030.

6.  Key rollover support

6.1.  Protocol support for key rollover events not requiring a change in
      cryptographic algorithm

   Key rollover events must be communicated to subordinate CAs so that
   they know to reissue certificates and entities holding certificates,
   so that they know to re-sign objects.  Key rollover events must also
   be communicated to validators so that they know to validate against a
   new certificate.

   No mechanism has yet been defined for communicating key rollovers.
   This could either be performed with in-protocol signaling or via an
   out-of-band mechanism using domain specific businesses processes.
   Whichever option is selected needs to be sufficiently robust to allow
   for all involved parties to reissue certificates, or re-sign objects,
   or just configure a new key, expeditiously.

   Advice is sought on whether in-protocol signaling should be developed
   or an out-of-band set of domain specific business processes should be
   used.

7.  Communication from validators to objects signers regarding
    validation status

   No mechanism has yet been defined to allow validators to tell a
   certificate issuer or object signer that a certificate it issued or
   object it signed has failed validation.  In an inter-domain routing
   context this means that validation failure might only be communicated
   via a routing failure when local policy is configured to drop a route
   if validation fails.

   This lack of validation status signaling could have catastrophic
   consequences if a problem occurs in a certificate or object near the
   top of the hierarchy.  Such a failure in validation could impact a
   significant percentage of the Internet's routing capability without
   providing adequate tools for diagnosis and remediation.

   Advice is sought on whether it is important for validators to be able
   to signal validation failures to certificate issuers and signers.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not define any IANA actions.  This section may be
   removed by the RFC Editor prior to publication.

9.  Security Considerations

   The RPKI needs to support better security in inter-domain routing.
   The security improvements should be partnered with improvements to
   the overall robustness and resilience of the inter-domain routing
   system.  Until the issues described in this document are addressed
   the fragility of the system means that it is not safe to deploy in
   production environments and must remain merely of academic interest.
