         Update to the Selection of Trustees for the IETF Trust
                    draft-ietf-iasa2-trust-update-00

Abstract

   This memo updates the selection of trustees for the IETF Trust.
   Previously, the Internet Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC)
   members also acted as trustees but the IAOC has been eliminated as
   part of an update of the structure of the Internet Administrative
   Support Activity (IASA).  This memo specifies that the trustees shall
   be selected separately.

   This memo updates RFCs 4071 and 4371 with regards to the selection of
   trustees.  All other aspects of the IETF Trust remain as they are
   today.

1.  Introduction

   This memo updates the selection of trustees for the IETF Trust.
   Previously, the Internet Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC)
   members also acted as trustees but the IAOC has been eliminated as
   part of an update of the structure of the Internet Administrative
   Support Activity (IASA).  This memo specifies that the trustees shall
   be selected separately.

   This memo updates RFCs 4071 and 4371 with regards to the selection of
   trustees.  All other aspects of the IETF Trust remain as they are
   today.

   For a discussion of why this change is needed and a rationale for
   these specific changes, see [I-D.ietf-iasa2-trust-rationale].

2.  Selection of Trustees

   This document revises the original Trustee selection procedures
   defined in [RFC4071] and [RFC4371], to eliminate the requirement that
   trustees be drawn from the members of the IAOC.

   In this newly revised IETF Trust structure, there will be five
   Trustees.  Three shall appointed by the IETF Nominating Committee
   (NomCom) and confirmed by the Internet Engineering Steering Group
   (IESG), one shall be appointed by the IESG, and one shall be
   appointed by the Internet Society (ISOC) Board of Trustees.

   The IETF Trust will provide a list of desired qualifications for the
   Trustee positions to each appointing body.

Internet-Draft         Trustees for the IETF Trust        September 2018


   A change to the Trust Agreement is required to put this change into
   effect, and this document requests that the current Trustees make
   this change at the earliest convenient time and no later than the end
   of the 104th IETF meeting in March 2019.

   The terms of the appointed trustees from IETF NomCom shall be three
   years.  The initial selection shall be one, two, and three year terms
   in order to initially stagger the terms and thus miminize potential
   annual Trustee turnover.  The other appointments by the IESG and the
   ISOC Board of Trustees shall be two year terms, with the initial
   terms being one and two years, respectively.

   IETF rules regarding recalls and other NomCom-related processes
   continue to apply [RFC7437].

3.  Acknowledgements

   The authors would like to thank members of the earlier IASA 2.0
   design team who were Brian Haberman, Eric Rescorla, Jari Arkko, Jason
   Livingood, Joe Hall, and Leslie Daigle.  The authors would also like
   to thank Alissa Cooper, Andrew Sullivan, Brian Carpenter, Lucy Lynch,
   and John Levine for interesting discussions in this problem space.

4.  Changes from Previous Versions

   RFC Editor: Please remove this section upon publication.

   The version draft-ietf-iasa2-trust-update-00.txt corrected the
   desired document status to BCP, and made several editorial and
   language updates.  This version also updated the wording for the
   request for the current trustees to adopt this change, from "earliest
   convenience" to "earliest convenient time".

   The version draft-arkko-iasa2-trust-update-00.txt was the initial
   version.
