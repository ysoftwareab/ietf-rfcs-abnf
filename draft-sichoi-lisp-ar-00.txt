    Abstract

       This document proposed a network-based mobility control scheme in
       wireless/mobile networks using the Locator-Identifier Separation
       Protocol (LISP). In the existing host-based mobility control, LISP
       Tunnel Router (TR) is implemented at mobile node. In the proposed
       scheme, each TR is implemented at the first-hop access router that
       mobile nodes are attached to in the wireless network. For network-
       based mobility control, we present the data delivery and handover
       control operations. It is expected that the proposed network-based
       scheme can reduce implementation overhead and handover latency of MN,
       compared to the existing host-based scheme.

    Internet-Draft Network-based Mobility Control in LISP Network  September

    1. Introduction

       The Locator-Identifier Separation Protocol (LISP)[2] gives a lot of
       scaling benefits by separating the current IP address spaces into
       Endpoint Identifiers(EIDs) and Routing Locators (RLOCs), such as
       reduction of routing tables size, more cost effective multi-homing,
       and traffic engineering capabilities.

       For mobility support, the LISP mobility architecture [3] is being
       discussed, in which it is assumed that a LISP mobile node (MN)
       implements the light-weight Tunnel Router (TR) functionality and
       thus MN acts as Ingress TR (ITR) or Egress TR (ETR)in mobile
       networks. In this LISP-MN architecture, a Map Server (MS) [4] is
       used as an anchor point for MN to provide the scalability of control
       plane, and the shortest path is used to minimize the latency of data
       packet delivery [2].

       However, this host-based mobility scheme tends to induce large
       handover latency during handover, since MN acts as a TR and thus
       obtains a new RLOC from the network. In this document, we propose a
       network-based mobility scheme to support fast handover. In the
       proposed scheme, a LISP TR is implemented at the first-hop access
       router (AR) that MN is attached to, rather than MN. The proposed
       network-based mobility scheme can reduce implementation overhead of
       MN since MN has no the functionality of TR, and reduce the handover
       latency of MN since the configuration of a new RLOC is omitted. All
       the other functionalities follow the LISP-MN architecture[3].

    3. Network Models

       Since TR's implemented location, the proposed scheme has a different
       structure with the conventional method from network models.

       +--+  /------------\  +--+  +------------+  +--+  /--------\  +----+
       |CN|--|   LISP     |--|TR|--|  Internet  |--|AR|--|Wireless|--| MN |

                           Figure 1 Network Architecture

       Figure 1 shows a simplified network model for host-based LISP
       mobility control [3], in which correspondent node (CN) is in the
       LISP site network, and MN is in the mobile network. Each TR may act
       as ITR or ETR, and for simplicity it is assumed that the MS in
       Internet also acts as LISP Map Server [4].

       +--+  /------------\  +--+  +------------+  +----+  /--------\  +--+

           Figure 2 Network model for network-based LISP mobility control

       Figure 2 shows a network model for the proposed network-based LISP
       mobility control, in which TR of MN is deployed with the first-hop
       AR that MN is attached to.

    4. Data Delivery Operations

       We compare data delivery operations of the two schemes, in which it
       is assumed that CN first sends a data packet to MN.

         CN               TR            Map             AR          MN/TR

          |               |              |              |               |
          |               |=LISP Encapsulated Data Packet(EID2:RLOC2)==>|
          |               |              |              |               |

               Figure 3 Data delivery in host-based mobility control

       Figure 3 shows the data delivery procedures of the existing host-
       based scheme. If MN enters an AR region, it configures RLOC by using
       the DHCP or address auto-configuration. Then, MN/TR binds its EID2
       and RLOC2 to MS. When CN sends a data packet, its TR sends a Map
       Request to MS, which is delivered to MN. The MN will respond with a
       Map Reply to TR. After that, the data packets can be exchanged
       between CN and MN using the LISP encapsulation at TR and MN.

              Figure 4 Data delivery in network-based mobility control

       Figure 4 describes the data delivery procedures of the proposed
       network-based scheme. Differently from the host-based scheme of
       Figure 3, the TR functionality is performed by AR, not MN, and thus
       the RLOC configuration is not required. The AR/TR will send the Map
       Register to MS and the Reply to TR of CN, on behalf of MN. The LISP
       data encapsulation will be also done at TR.

    5. Handover Control Operations

       We compare the handover control operations of the two schemes, in
       which it is assumed that MN moves from ARold to ARnew region during
       data transmissions with CN.

         CN              TR                                        MN/TR

                  Figure 5 Handover in host-based mobility control

       Figure 5 shows the handover procedures in the host-based scheme [3].
       Before handover, MN/TR with EID2:RLOC2 is communicating to CN with
       EID1:RLOC1. By handover to new AR region, MN/TR shall configure a
       new RLOC3 address using DHCP or address auto-configuration scheme.
       After that, the Map Request/Reply messages are exchanged to TR of CN
       to update the modified RLOC3, which is based on [3].

                Figure 6 Handover in network-based mobility control

       Figure 6 describes the handover in the proposed network-based scheme.
       Differently from Figure 5 RLOC3 of ARnew is used and MN does not
       need to configure the new RLOC. With network attachment, the Map
       Request/Reply messages are exchanged between TR of CN and TR of MN
       (ARnew) to update the modified RLOC3.

    8. Conclusions

       This document proposed a LISP-based mobility control scheme in the
       mobile networks. From the analysis and comparison of handover
       latency for three candidate schemes, the following two points are
       suggested in the LISP mobility architecture: 1) each LISP Tunnel
       Router should be located with the first-hop 'access router' of
       mobile nodes, rather than the mobile node, and 2) for handover
       support, the RLOC update operation should be performed between
       Ingress TR and Egress TR so as to provide the route optimization.
