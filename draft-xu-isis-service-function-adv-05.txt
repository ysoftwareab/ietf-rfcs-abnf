               Advertising Service Functions Using IS-IS
                 draft-xu-isis-service-function-adv-05

Abstract

   The MPLS source routing mechanism developed by Source Packet Routing
   in Networking (SPRING) WG can be leveraged to realize a unified
   source routing instruction which works across both IPv4 and IPv6
   underlays in addition to the MPLS underlay.  The unified source
   routing instruction can be used to realize a transport-independent
   service function chaining by encoding the service function path
   information or service function chain information as an MPLS label
   stack.  This document describes how to advertise service functions
   and their corresponding attributes (e.g., service function label)
   using IS-IS.

1.  Introduction

   [I-D.xu-mpls-service-chaining] describes how to leverage the unified
   source routing instruction
   [I-D.xu-mpls-unified-source-routing-instruction] to realize a
   transport-independent service function chaining by encoding the
   Service Function Path (SFP) or Service Function Chain (SFC)
   information as an MPLS label stack.  To allow a service classifier to
   attach the MPLS label stack which represents a particular SFP or SFC
   to the selected traffic, the service classifier needs to know on
   which Service Function Forwarder (SFF) a given Service Function (SF)
   is located and what service function label is used to indicate that
   SF.  This document describes how to advertise SFs and their
   corresponding attributes (e.g., service function label) using IS-IS.

2.  Terminology

   This memo makes use of the terms defined in
   [I-D.xu-mpls-service-chaining] and [RFC4971].

3.  Solution Description

   SFFs within the SFC domain need to advertise each SF they are
   offering by using a new sub-TLV of the IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV
   [RFC4971].  This new sub-TLV is called as Service Function sub-TLV.
   The Service Function sub-TLV could appear multiple times wihin a
   given IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV when more than one SF needs to be
   advertised.  The scope of the advertisement depends on the
   application but it is recommended that it SHOULD be domain-wide.  To
   support the approach of encoding SFP information in the form of an
   MPLS label stack as described in [I-D.xu-mpls-service-chaining], SFFs
   SHOULD allocate a locally significant MPLS label to each SF they are
   offering.  Therefore, SFFs need to advertise the corresponding
   service function label to each SF they are offering by using a sub-
   TLV of the above Service Function sub-TLV, called SF Label sub-TLV.

      Service Function Identifier: A unique identifier that represents
      an SF within an SFC-enabled domain.

      Sub-TLVs: contains zero or more sub-TLVs corresponding to the
      particular attributes of a given SF.  The SF Label sub-TLV as
      defined in Section 3.2 is one such sub-TLV.  Other sub-TLVs are to
      be defined in the future.
