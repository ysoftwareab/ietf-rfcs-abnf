         A Profile for Autonomous System Provider Authorization
                   draft-ietf-sidrops-aspa-profile-00

Abstract

   This document defines a standard profile for Autonomous System
   Provider Authorization in the Resource Public Key Infrastructure.  An
   Autonomous System Provider Authorization is a digitally signed object
   that provides a means of verifying that a Customer Autonomous System
   holder has authorized a Provider Autonomous System to be its upstream
   provider and for the Provider to send prefixes received from the
   Customer Autonomous System in all directions including providers and
   peers.

1.  Introduction

   The primary purpose of the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)
   is to improve routing security.  (See [RFC6480] for more
   information.)  As part of this infrastructure, a mechanism is needed
   to verify that a Provider AS (PAS) has permission from a Customer AS
   (CAS) holder to send routes in all directions.  The digitally signed

Internet-Draft                ASPA Profile                      May 2019


   Autonomous System Provider Authorization (ASPA) object provides this
   verification mechanism.

   The ASPA uses the template for RPKI digitally signed objects
   [RFC6488], which defines a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)
   [RFC5652] wrapper for the ASPA content as well as a generic
   validation procedure for RPKI signed objects.  As ASPAs need to be
   validated with RPKI certificates issued by the current
   infrastructure, we assume the mandatory-to-implement algorithms in
   [RFC6485], or its successor.

   To complete the specification of the ASPA (see Section 4 of
   [RFC6488]), this document defines:

   1.  The object identifier (OID) that identifies the ASPA signed
       object.  This OID appears in the eContentType field of the
       encapContentInfo object as well as the content-type signed
       attribute within the signerInfo structure).

   2.  The ASN.1 syntax for the ASPA content, which is the payload
       signed by the CAS.  The ASPA content is encoded using the ASN.1
       [X680] Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) [X690].

   3.  The steps required to validate an ASPA beyond the validation
       steps specified in [RFC6488]).

2.  The ASPA Content Type

   The content-type for an ASPA is defined as id-cct-ASPA, which has the
   numerical value of 1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.1.TBD.  This OID MUST appear
   both within the eContentType in the encapContentInfo structure as
   well as the content-type signed attribute within the signerInfo
   structure (see [RFC6488]).

3.  The ASPA eContent

   The content of an ASPA identifies the Customer AS (CAS) as well as
   the Provider AS (PAS) that is authorized to further propagate
   announcements received from the customer.  If customer has multiple
   providers, it issues multiple ASPAs, one for each provider AS.  An
   ASPA is formally defined as:

       ct-ASPA CONTENT-TYPE ::=
           { ASProviderAttestation IDENTIFIED BY id-ct-ASPA }

       id-ct-ASPA OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-ct TBD }

       ASProviderAttestation ::= SEQUENCE {
           version [0] ASPAVersion DEFAULT v0,
           AFI  AddressFamilyIdentifier,
           customerASID  ASID,
           providerASID  ASID }

       ASPAVersion ::= INTEGER  { v0(0) }

       AddressFamilyIdentifier ::= INTEGER

       ASID ::= INTEGER

   Note that this content appears as the eContent within the
   encapContentInfo as specified in [RFC6488].

3.1.  version

   The version number of the ASProviderAttestation MUST be v0.

3.2.  AFI

   The AFI field contains Address Family Identifier for which the
   relation between customer and provider ASes is authorized.  Presently
   defined values for the Address Family Identifier field are specified
   in the IANA's Address Family Numbers registry [IANA-AF].

3.3.  customerASID

   The customerASID field contains the AS number of the Autonomous
   System that authorizes an upstream provider (listed in the
   providerASId) to propagate prefixes in the specified address family
   other ASes.

3.4.  providerASID

   The providerASID contains the AS number that is authorized to further
   propagate announcements in the specified address family received from
   the customer.

4.  ASPA Validation

   Before a relying party can use an ASPA to validate a routing
   announcement, the relying party MUST first validate the ASPA object
   itself.  To validate an ASPA, the relying party MUST perform all the
   validation checks specified in [RFC6488] as well as the following
   additional ASPA-specific validation step.

   o  The autonomous system identifier delegation extension [RFC3779] is
      present in the end-entity (EE) certificate (contained within the
      ASPA), and the customer AS number in the ASPA is contained within
      the set of AS numbers specified by the EE certificate's autonomous
      system identifier delegation extension.
