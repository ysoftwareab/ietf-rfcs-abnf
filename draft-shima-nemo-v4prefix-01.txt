1.  Introduction

   NEMO (RFC3963) [1] specifies the mechanism to provide mobility
   functions to IPv6 networks.  All IPv6 networks behind a NEMO capable
   router can move around all over the Internet with the NEMO router,
   without breaking existing connections between nodes inside the moving
   network and nodes of the Internet.

   The NEMO specification mentions only IPv6 networks.  In this
   document, we propose an extension which adds the IPv4 network support
   to the NEMO specification.  With the option we introduce in this
   document, we can operate IPv4 mobile networks over the IPv6 network
   infrastructure.

   Considering the situation that we need to live with both IPv4 and
   IPv6 networks during the transition period before we have completely
   shifted to IPv6, many IPv4 devices/networks will be used for a long
   time.  NEMO provides a simple mechanism to enable IPv6 networks move
   around the Internet.  The technology is expected to be used for
   various scenes, such as implementing car/train networks, a personal
   area networks, or even providing redundancy to networks of an entire
   site of an
   organization(draft-nagami-mip6-nemo-multihome-fixed-network [2]).
   Supporting only IPv6 devices and dropping IPv4 devices are not good
   idea especially in the forthcoming long transition period.

   However defining a new mobile network protocol for IPv4 is not
   expected, since IPv4 is going to disappear finally.  This document
   defines a mechanism to provide IPv4 mobile network using IPv6
   connections.  We can use with both protocols with this proposed
   technology and we also can move to IPv6 only network seamlessly when
   the IPv4 network completes its role.

2.  Sample scenarios

2.1.  A train company

   Assuming that a train company wants to provide IP connectivity to
   their passengers.  Considering the current Internet situation, they
   cannot ignore IPv4 networks, but at the same time, they need to
   support IPv6 for the future.  In such a case, the company need to
   assign both IPv4 and IPv6 networks in each train.  The network can be
   designed as Figure 1.

   Figure 1: A sample network for a train company

   Each train has one IPv6 network and one IPv4 private network for the
   Internet service to the passengers.  Each mobile router in a train
   works as an IPv6 NEMO router as specified in the NEMO specification.
   At the same time, each train has a NAT box to translate the internal
   private addresses to a global address.  A mobile router also register
   the global address using the mechanism described in this document.  A
   home agent located in the train company will create IPv6 tunnel to
   every mobile routers and forwards all IPv6 traffic from/to the mobile

   routers and also forwards all IPv4 traffic from/to each global
   address assigned to each train network using the tunnel connections,
   which tunnels are created by the basic NEMO mechanism.

   In the above example, a separate NAT box is located to each train,
   however, the function can be integrated to each mobile router
   depending on the implementation.

2.2.  Site multihoming

   There is a proposal to provide a site multihoming mechanism using the
   NEMO technology ([2]).  Considering the current Internet situation,
   we cannot ignore IPv4 connectivity when providing an Internet
   connection to customers.  In this case, the following network design
   can be applied.

   Figure 2: A sample network for a multihomed site

   In the above example, a company network has three network prefixes
   for its site. 2001:2DB:1::/48 for IPv6 and 202.210.1.0/28 and
   202.200.1.0/28 for IPv4 networks.  The internal network, which
   usually used for the intranet is NATed.  The mobile router placed at
   the boundary between the Internet and the company network will
   register those three network prefixes using existing NEMO signaling
   messages for the IPv6 prefix and the extension described in this
   document for IPv4 prefixes.

   All IPv4 traffic which source or destination address is in the range
   of 202.210.1.0/28 or 202.200.1.0/28 is tunneled between the mobile
   router and the home agent located in a Mobile Network Service

   Provider using an IPv6 tunnel, which tunnel is created by the basic
   NEMO mechanism.

   The example also implies that the mobile router located at the
   boundary of the company network has multiple IPv6 connectivities to
   increase redundancy.  If we use the multiple care-of addresses
   registration mechanism as described in [2] and [3], we can also
   provide a simple NEMO based multihome network, with both IPv6 and
   IPv4 support.

3.  Overview of the approach

   It is one way to define a new protocol which supports IPv4 network
   mobility functions.  However, assuming that the Internet shifts from
   IPv4 to IPv6, it is not a good idea to invent a new protocol for the
   old IP protocol.  We take the following approaches.

   o  Do not define any IPv4 extension protocol, since we will not have
      IPv4 in the future.

   o  Do not break existing NEMO specification.

   The basic mechanism of the NEMO specification is a simple signal
   processing to maintain the location of mobile routers and exchange of
   moving network information.  All traffic from/to the moving networks
   are tunneled between the mobile router and its home agent.  The
   mechanism is independent of the protocol version transmitted in the
   tunnel.

   It is possible to use the tunnel to transmit IPv4 packets, to the
   condition that we can exchange the IPv4 routing information of the
   moving network.  For example, using a dynamic routing protocol
   between a home agent and a mobile router makes it possible.

   We define a new option which provides the way to exchange such
   information in NEMO signaling messages.  Such an option is useful
   when we are using the explicit mode operation to provide network
   mobility, since otherwise we cannot know the prefix information
   behind a mobile router.

4.  Terminology

   o  mobile node

         An IPv6 host or router which has a Mobile IPv6 or a NEMO
         function respectively.

   o  mobile host

         An IPv6 host which has a Mobile IPv6 function.

   o  mobile router

         An IPv6 router which has a NEMO function.  A mobile router is
         usually able to act as a mobile host.

   o  IPv4 Mobile Network Prefix

         An IPv4 network prefix which is assigned to the network
         attached to the ingress interface of a mobile router.

   o  IPv4 Mobile Address

         An IPv4 address which identify a mobile host.  A mobile router
         also can have an IPv4 Mobile Address, if it needs an IPv4
         Mobile Address.  A mobile router usually has an IPv4 address on
         its ingress interface, if it has a IPv4 mobile network.  In
         that case, the IPv4 Mobile Address is the IPv4 address assigned
         to the ingress interface of the mobile router.  A mobile router
         may need another IPv4 Mobile Address which is not one of the
         IPv4 address of the mobile network.

6.  Mobile Router operation

   A mobile router which has IPv4 networks on its ingress interface can
   include the IPv4 Mobile Network Prefix option in a Binding Update
   message to its home agent.  After receiving a successful
   acknowledgment from the home agent, the mobile router adds a route
   entry which indicates that all traffic from the IPv4 networks is
   forwarded to the tunnel interface created between the mobile router
   and its home agent.

   A mobile router will receive a Binding Acknowledgment message with
   the IPv4 Mobile Prefix Registration Status Option when a home agent
   supports this extension.  If the Binding Acknowledgment does not
   include the option, the IPv4 prefix registration cannot be used.

   After successful registration of IPv4 network prefixes, a mobile
   router forwards all IPv4 packets which source address is in the range
   of the registered IPv4 prefix to its home agent using an IPv6 tunnel
   created between the mobile router and its home agent, when those IPv4
   packets are received from the ingress interface of the mobile router.
   On the other hand, when the mobile router receives IPv4 packets from
   the tunnel and the destination address of the internal packet is in
   the range of the registered IPv4 prefix, the mobile router forwards
   those IPv4 packets to its ingress interface.

   Figure 3 shows the packet format.

7.  Mobile Host operation

   A mobile host can have a fixed IPv4 address, which never change
   during handover.  We call the address as an IPv4 Mobile Address.  A
   mobile host specifies its IPv4 Mobile Address in a Binding Update
   message.  When specifying an IPv4 Mobile Address, a mobile host need
   to set the Prefix Length field to 32 and put the IPv4 Mobile Address
   in the IPv4 Mobile Network Prefix field of the IPv4 Mobile Network
   Prefix Option.

   A mobile host will receive a Binding Acknowledgment message with the
   IPv4 Mobile Prefix Registration Status Option when a home agent
   supports this extension.  If the Binding Acknowledgment does not
   include the option, the IPv4 node identifier registration cannot be
   used.

   After successful registration of an IPv4 Mobile Address, the IPv4
   node identifier can be used as a source address of IPv4 packets
   generated at the mobile host.  Such packets are forwarded to the home
   agent of the mobile node using an IPv6 tunnel interface created
   between those two nodes.  If a mobile host receives IPv4 packets
   which destination address is same with the IPv4 node identifier of
   the mobile host from the IPv6 tunnel interface, the host accepts the
   packets as its own packets.

8.  Home Agent operation

   A home agent which supports the IPv4 Mobile Network Prefix Option
   will add a route entry for the IPv4 network prefix when it receives a
   Binding Update message with the option.  A Binding Acknowledgment
   message sent from the home agent must include the IPv4 Mobile Prefix
   Registration Status Option to indicate the processing status of the
   received IPv4 Mobile Prefix Option.

   When a home agent accept the IPv4 Mobile Network Prefix Option, the
   status field of the IPv4 Mobile Network Registration Status Option
   must be set to 0 indicating success.  Otherwise, the status code must
   be filled with an error code as described in section Section 5.2.

   After successful registration of IPv4 prefixes, a home agent start
   forwarding IPv4 packets which destination address is in the range of
   registered IPv4 prefix to the tunnel to the mobile router which
   registered the corresponding IPv4 prefix.  At the same time, the home
   agent also start accepting IPv4 packets sent from the tunnel which
   source address is in the range of the registered IPv4 prefix and
   start forwarding to the IPv4 internet.

   If the Prefix Length field in the incoming IPv4 Mobile Network Prefix
   Option is equal to 32, a home agent treats the value in the IPv4
   Mobile Network Prefix field as an IPv4 Mobile Address.  The address
   must be one of addresses of the IPv4 network that the home agent is
   attached to.  If the validation succeeds, a home agent starts
   proxying the IPv4 node identifier included in the option (after
   checking there is no other nodes which is using the IPv4 address).  A
   home agent will intercept all IPv4 packets delivered to the home
   network if the destination address of the packets is equal to the
   IPv4 Mobile Address.  These intercepted packets will be forwarded to
   the mobile host using an IPv6 tunnel created between the home agent
   and the mobile host.  If a home agent receives IPv4 packets which
   source address is the IPv4 Mobile Address from the IPv6 tunnel
   interface, a home agent will forward the packets to the IPv4
   Internet.

   Figure 3 shows the packet format.

9.  Choosing a home agent

   A mobile router need to know which home agent supports the option
   discussed in this document.  One possible way to do it is to define a
   special bit in a Dynamic Home Agent Address Discovery message to
   indicate that a home agent supports this option.  This mechanism
   requires to modify all home agent to understand the bit even if the
   home agents does not support the IPv4 prefix option.

   Another way is to try to register with the option and see what
   happen.  If the home agent to which a mobile router sent a
   registration message supports the IPv4 Network Prefix Option, it will
   reply with the IPv4 Network Prefix Registration Status Option.
   Otherwise, the status option will not be included.  If the home agent
   which the mobile router has tried to register does not support the
   option, the mobile router can deregister from the home agent and try
   another home agent.

10.  Relationship with v4traversal

   This document describes the mechanism to support IPv4 networks
   located behind a mobile router over the IPv6 network infrastructure.
   The signaling messages and a tunnel connection between a mobile
   router and a home agent uses IPv6.

   The v4traversal mechanism provides the way to use IPv4 as a protocol
   for signaling messages and tunnel connections.  Using the v4traversal
   mechanism will provide IPv6 mobile network over the IPv4 network
   infrastructure.

   These two mechanisms aims the different goals.  The combination of
   these mechanisms are also possible and when we use these two
   mechanism at the same time, we can operate IPv4 mobile networks over
   IPv4 network infrastructure.

11.  Relationship with NAT

   The mechanism described in this document has nothing to do with the
   NAT mechanism.  As described in Figure 1, a NAT box can be located as
   one of internal nodes of an IPv4 mobile network.  We do not need to
   distinguish the NAT box from other IPv4 nodes.

   Of course, it is possible to design the NAT feature in a mobile
   router.  Such a design will reduce the number of nodes to be managed
   in one mobile network.  However, the logical network topology is the
   same with the network when we operate the NAT box and the mobile
   router in theory.  Therefore, there is no need to differentiate the
   combined case and the separate case.  The decision just depends on
   the policy and available implementation.

14.  Appendix

14.1.  An unnumbered tunnel for IPv4

   Some implementation (for example, *BSD implementation) do not support
   an unnumbered tunnel for IPv4 communication.  In this case, we need
   to assign a valid (or just a dummy) IPv4 address on both tunnel end
   points of a mobile router and a home agent side.  It is possible to
   assign non-routable addresses, such as 169.254/16, since the
   addresses assigned on the both end of the tunnel interface between a
   mobile router and a home agent never used for real communication in
   theory.  However, an implementor must take care the address selection
   algorithm for IPv4 used in their implementation.  For example, *BSD
   system choose an IPv4 address of the outgoing interface, if we does
   not specify the source address explicitly.  This makes invalid (which
   means, the packet has non-routable address in its source address)
   packet to be sent to the Internet.
