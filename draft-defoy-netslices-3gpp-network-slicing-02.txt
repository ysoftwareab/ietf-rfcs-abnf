1.  Introduction

   This document describes work conducted at the 3GPP standard
   organization on 5G Network Slicing.  Its goal is to provide detailed
   use cases, and help better define requirements, for Internet
   Protocols supporting Network Slicing.

   The concept of Network Slicing (NS) is considered a key mechanism for
   5G networks to serve vertical industries with widely different
   service needs, in term of latency, reliability, capacity, and domain
   specific extra functionalities.  It does so by exposing isolated
   partitions of network resources and services.  The IETF Bar-BoF

Internet-Draft        Network Slicing 3GPP Use Case         October 2017


   NETSLICES activity studies the need for supporting protocols.  In
   particular, [I-D.gdmb-netslices-intro-and-ps] defines NS in a broad
   context and suggests related problems and work areas.  It also
   identifies the need to provide use cases such as, for example, ultra-
   low latency and massive-connectivity machine communication services.
   We propose to review ongoing NS work in 3GPP within the present
   document.  This constitutes in our view another valid type of use
   case, since 3GPP architecture may ultimately use or integrate with NS
   solutions defined in IETF.

   Sections 2 to 6 aim to represent the current state of NS and related
   aspects in 3GPP.  We attempted to leave our own analysis out of these
   sections and present it into section 7.  For simplicity, 3GPP-
   specific acronyms are defined in the section they are used, which is
   mostly section 3.

1.1.  Background

   The 3GPP standard organization is in the process of developing 5G
   system architecture, which includes NS.  In the present document we
   will use information collected from 3GPP Release 15 specifications
   (as well as preliminary studies from Release 14 when specifications
   are not yet available).  This release aims to address a more urgent
   subset of commercial needs in "5G Phase 1", with expected deployments
   in 2020.  Work on NS is split between different working and study
   groups, reviewed here in separate sections.

1.2.  NS Work in 3GPP Prior to 5G Phase 1

   While the present document will only focus on NS in 5G Phase 1, an
   early form of NS was introduced in Release 13, with the Dedicated
   Core Network (DCN) or DECOR feature, where dedicated core network
   nodes are forming a DCN serving subscribers or devices with a certain
   "usage type" (e.g. machine-to-machine or enterprise).  In the Release
   14 eDECOR feature, the DCN selection mechanism was extended to be
   assisted by the device, which can now send its usage type to the RAN.
   This is specified in [_3GPP.23.401].  Deployments are expected in
   2017 and 2018.

2.  Network Slicing Requirements in 3GPP

   NS requirements are included in [_3GPP.22.261].  There are
   requirements related to:

   o  Provisioning: create/modify/delete Network Slices, provision
      network functions to be used in Network Slices, define network
      services and capabilities supported by a network slice.

Internet-Draft        Network Slicing 3GPP Use Case         October 2017


   o  Managing association to slices: configure association of devices
      and services to Network Slices, move/remove user between/from
      slices.

   o  Interoperating: support roaming and non-roaming using the same
      home slice, support devices simultaneously connected to multiple
      slices.

   o  Supporting performance and isolation: support dynamic slice
      elasticity, ensure performance isolation during normal and elastic
      slice operation and during slice creation or deletion, enable
      operators to differentiate performance and functionalities between
      slices.

3.  Network Slicing in Logical 5G Architecture in 3GPP

   5G network architecture is entering its normative stage in 2017 with
   a "5G System - Phase 1" Release 15 work item, which is in the process
   of producing two technical specifications: 23.501 "System
   Architecture for the 5G System" and 23.502 "Procedures for the 5G
   System".  At this early stage, though, we will still need to refer to
   the earlier technical report [_3GPP.23.799].  The following text
   summarizes what has been agreed about NS (refer to section 8.1 of
   that report for more details).

   A Network Slice is a complete logical network including Radio Access
   Network (RAN) and Core Network (CN).  It provides telecommunication
   services and network capabilities, which may vary (or not) from slice
   to slice.  Distinct RAN and Core Network Slices will exist.  A device
   may access multiple Network Slices simultaneously through a single
   RAN.

   The device may provide Network Slice Selection Assistance Information
   (NSSAI) parameters to the network to help it select a RAN and a core
   network part of a slice instance for the device.  A single NSSAI may
   lead to the selection of several slices.  The network may also use
   device capabilities, subscription information and local operator
   policies to do the selection.

   A NSSAI is a collection of smaller components, Session Management
   NSSAIs (SM-NSSAI), which each include a Slice Service Type (SST) and
   possibly a Slice Differentiator (SD).  Slice service type refers to
   an expected network behavior in terms of features and services (e.g.
   specialized for broadband or massive IoT), while the slice
   differentiator can help selecting among several Network Slice
   instances of the same type, e.g. to isolate traffic related to
   different services into different slices.

Internet-Draft        Network Slicing 3GPP Use Case         October 2017


   A PDU session is a 5G concept for an association between the device
   and a data network, which can be IP, Ethernet or Unstructured (i.e.
   transparent to the 5G system).  The device will associate an
   application with one out of multiple parallel PDU sessions, each PDU
   session correspond to one core Network Slice and one RAN slice.
   Different PDU sessions may belong to different slices.  More
   precisely, an application will be associated with a SM-NSSAI (as
   mentioned above, this includes a slice service type and may also
   include a slice differentiator), and data for this application will
   be routed to a PDU session associated to this SM-NSSAI.

   Part of the control plane, the Common Control Network Function
   (CCNF), is common to all or several slices.  It includes the Access
   and mobility Management Function (AMF) as well as the Network Slice
   Selection Function (NSSF), which is in charge of selecting core
   Network Slice instances.  Besides those shared functions, different
   Network Slices may also have dedicated control plane functions such
   as the Session Management Function (SMF), which manages PDU sessions.
   User plane functions are dedicated to each slice.  The RAN selects a
   CCNF for a new PDU session.  CCNF may initiate the redirection of
   service for a device towards another CCNF, initially at session
   setup, or later on.

   In figures 1 and 2 we attempt to represent the use of NS in 3GPP
   logical architecture (those figures are our interpretation and are
   not directly adapted from the report).  Figure 1 represents the role
   of NSSAI in network selection.  Figure 2 represents the major network
   functions and interfaces in the context of RAN and Core Network
   Slicing.  The terms used in these diagrams were introduced earlier.
   System description and diagrams in section 4 of [_3GPP.23.501] can
   provide additional context.

3.1.  Early Work on RAN Slicing

   In line with the logical architecture described above, early work on
   RAN slicing is being conducted as part of the larger Release 14
   "Study on New Radio Access Technology".  Key principles are likely to
   include the following, extracted from [_3GPP.38.801]:

   1.  RAN will support differentiated handling of traffic between pre-
       configured, isolated RAN slices.  How to perform this is left to
       implementation.

   2.  Selection of the RAN slice will be based on IDs (which should be
       the slice service type and slice differentiator defined above)
       provided by the device or core network.

   3.  A RAN slice may or may not be available at a given location.

   4.  RAN will select the core network slice.

   5.  QoS differentiation within a RAN slice will be supported as well.

Internet-Draft        Network Slicing 3GPP Use Case         October 2017


4.  Management Aspect of Network Slicing in 3GPP

   3GPP is developing a Release 14 "Study on management and
   orchestration of NS for next generation network" technical report
   [_3GPP.28.801], which defines an information model where the Network
   Slice as well as physical and virtualized network functions belong to
   the network operator domain, while the virtualized resources belong
   to another domain operated by a virtualization infrastructure service
   provider.

   The concept of "Network Slice Subnet" is used in the model, as
   defined originally in [NGMN_Network_Slicing].  Network Slice Subnet
   instances are comprised of physical and virtual resources, have a
   life cycle independent from Network Slices they belong to, can be
   shared between several Network Slices and may be associated with
   other Network Slice Subnet instances.

   Multiple management use cases are described, ranging from creating
   and monitoring a slice instance to configuring its SLA policy,
   capacity and roaming support.  It is also expected that some level of
   slice management will be exposed to customers, and that operators
   will have the possibility to create end-to-end Network Slices
   involving multiple operators' networks.

   Key issues are identified, including creating a slice across multiple
   administrative domains, sharing a Network Slice between multiple
   services, moving towards a more autonomous management, as well as
   additional management specific key issues.

   Finally, the life cycle of a slice is defined over 4 phases:
   preparation phase including design and pre-provisioning, an
   "instantiation, configuration and activation" phase, a run-time phase
   including supervision and reporting, as well as upgrade,
   reconfiguration and scaling, and a decommissioning phase.

5.  5G Virtual Infrastructure Management in 3GPP

   To support the logical architecture defined earlier, some aspects of
   virtualization infrastructure management are also being standardized
   by 3GPP, through the activity "Management of mobile networks that
   include virtualized network functions".  This includes 5 work tasks,
   the first of which deals with concept, architecture and requirements
   [_3GPP.28.500], and 4 additional specialized work tasks on
   configuration, fault, lifecycle and performance management, are in
   the process of creating more detailed technical specification
   documents.

Internet-Draft        Network Slicing 3GPP Use Case         October 2017


   The new 5G management system is tied to NFV-MANO, as defined by ETSI.
   Its system architecture is described in [_3GPP.28.500] and
   represented in Figure 3 (directly adapted from TS28.500).  It defines
   interconnections between the 3GPP management system and the NFV-MANO
   system.  NFV-MANO has the responsibility to manage NFV Infrastructure
   (NFVI) and VNF lifecycle, and to report performance data, fault and
   VNF instance information to 3GPP management system.

              Figure 3: 3GPP Network Management Architecture

   The major building blocks on the left are from pre-existing 3GPP
   architecture and on the right are from ETSI NFV architecture.  Itf-N
   is the traditional 3GPP management interface between the network

   manager and domain and element managers, some of which will now be
   collocated with VNFs.  Other interfaces identified in the diagram are
   defined as part of the NFV architecture and described in published
   NFV specifications (which themselves do not make mention of NS).

   o  (1) Os-Ma-nfvo enables managing Network Service Descriptors (NSD),
      network service lifecycle, performance, faults and VNF packages.
      The NSD information model is specified by ETSI NFV as well.  It
      enables describing network connectivity topology graphs where VNFs
      are connected together through virtual links.  An NSD also
      includes VNF descriptors, which include memory and CPU
      requirements, a link to a software image, initial setup scripts,
      etc.

   o  (2) Or-Vnfm includes package management, VNF lifecycle/fault/
      configuration management, virtualized resources management (in
      indirect mode as seen below), and relays notifications from the
      VNF or EM.

   o  (3) Or-Vi and (4) Vi-Vnfm are the northbound interface of the
      Virtual Infrastructure Manager (VIM).  The orchestrator can
      basically use a direct interface to VIM, or indirectly go through
      the VNF manager over Or-Vnfm.  The orchestrator can add software
      images, create/update/terminate virtualized compute/network/
      storage resources allocations, manage resource capacity, manage
      network virtual paths, run and query performance collection jobs,
      set quotas.  Location/affinity constraints can be applied when
      creating resources.

   o  (5) Ve-Vnfm is used both between VNFM and EM and between VNFM and
      VNFs.  It includes lifecycle, performance, fault and configuration
      management, as well as notifications from the EM that VNFM can
      subscribe to.

   o  (6) Nf-Vi is for assignment of virtualized resources, hardware
      resource configuration and state information exchange.

   o  (7) Vn-Nf represents the execution environment provided to the
      VNF.

6.  Security for Network Slicing in 3GPP

   The present section on NS security is based on the "Study on
   Architecture and Security for Next Generation System", a Release 14
   study item.  Its related technical report is [_3GPP.33.899], and
   covers, among other areas, a NS security area dealing with service
   access, network function sharing and isolation.  Multiple key issues




de Foy & Rahman          Expires April 19, 2018                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft        Network Slicing 3GPP Use Case         October 2017


   are summarized here (refer to [_3GPP.33.899] section 5.8 for more
   details):

   1.  Isolation requirements, especially performance isolation, ask for
       data plane actions on one slice to have no influence on other
       Network Slices and for control plane actions (e.g.
       creation/update/deletion) to have little influence on other
       slices.  Lack of isolation can enable DoS attacks from one slice
       to another, especially since some functions can be shared between
       slices.  Moreover, a device can access multiple Network Slices,
       which increases the possibility for leakage/breach type of issues
       between Network Slices, both from the device and the service
       side.

   2.  Different Network Slices may need to implement different security
       policies, e.g. in term of authentication requirements (IoT vs.
       mobile broadband user).  Authentication may be centralized and/or
       per-slice.

   3.  Security and privacy of devices' access to Network Slices is also
       a concern.  It may be possible to forge slice selection
       information for a device.  Slice selection information sent over
       the access network can also lead to confidentiality issues.  The
       proposed key hierarchy supports having different keys for
       different slices.  How to enable security isolation of a common
       control plane between different Network Slices is not addressed
       at this point.

   4.  Security of sensitive shared network elements such as the HSS
       (which holds customers' profiles) is identified as a key issue as
       well.

   5.  Slice management functions should be secured, since an attacker
       may use them, e.g. to delete a slice.  Slice management
       capabilities exposed through APIs for 3rd parties are especially
       vulnerable.

   6.  Security on inter-slice communications is an issue in several
       scenarios, for example when multiple Network Slices share control
       plane functions, and when a RAN slice and a Core Network slice
       are interconnected to form a complete slice.  Each slice is
       considered a different trusted domain.

   7.  A range of potential issues related to virtualization are yet to
       be explored further, though it is not clear if they are in the
       scope of 3GPP.  Issues include for example isolation between VNFs
       hosted by the same hypervisor, authentication between VNFs,
       performance isolation between VNFs.

Internet-Draft        Network Slicing 3GPP Use Case         October 2017


7.  Analysis and Input to IETF NETSLICES

   Earlier sections of this document summarized our understanding of 5G
   architecture and requirements for NS, as defined by 3GPP, in their
   current state.  Our goal in these sections was to provide context to
   IETF NETSLICES, since a protocol or framework defined by IETF for NS
   may be used to implement or interoperate with 3GPP-compliant 5G
   systems.  In reference to Figure 3, the scope of IETF involvement
   with NS could be within NFV Infrastructure, as well as some aspects
   of the control plane on the right-hand side of the figure.  The
   concept of "Network Slice Subnet" discussed in section 4 may be
   useful as a building block, e.g. a single-domain and composable
   service chain that is used to assemble a network slice.  Defining the
   interfaces of such a component could help focusing on sharing between
   Network Slices and extending Network Slices across domains.

   We will now attempt to derive high level use cases and requirements
   from this work.  The goal is to serve as 3GPP-focused input to future
   efforts to gather use cases and requirements for IETF NETSLICES.

7.1.  Use Cases

   The following 3GPP-focused use cases for NS are derived from the
   reviewed 3GPP specifications and reports.  Especially, management
   related use cases are derived from [_3GPP.28.801] and operational use
   cases are derived from [_3GPP.23.501].

   The goal here is to describe the use cases at high level only, with
   the understanding that the IETF NETSLICES group may choose to define
   selected use cases further if needed.

   In the following text we will use the terms "Complete 3GPP Network
   Slice" to refer to a "Network Slice Instance" used by 3GPP, and "3GPP
   Network Slice Subnet" to refer to "Network Slice Subnet Instance".
   Moreover, we consider that the (IETF) Network Slice concept is a
   generalization of the "3GPP Network Slice Subnet", i.e. the "3GPP
   Network Slice Subnet" is a particular Network Slice which happens to
   be part of a 3GPP network.

7.1.1.  Management Use Case: Create or Terminate a 3GPP Network Slice
        Subnet

   The operator's OSS/BSS provides a description of a Network Slice to
   the Orchestrator, which, through the Virtual Infrastructure Manager,
   configures compute and network elements to create a Network Slice
   holding a specific set of interconnected virtual and/or physical
   network functions.  User plane Network Slices include one or more
   bidirectional paths between network functions (i.e. one or more



de Foy & Rahman          Expires April 19, 2018                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft        Network Slicing 3GPP Use Case         October 2017


   service function chains).  Control plane Network Slices can either
   include a set of service function chains or alternatively can
   interconnect multiple network functions in a virtual network.  In all
   cases, Network Slices are defined with a variable set of reserved
   KPIs, including minimum and maximum throughput, delay, packet loss,
   etc.

   Potential requirements:

   o  A Network Slice can be a service function chain or a virtual
      network

   o  A Network Slice can be associated with a variable set of resource
      reservation with regards to KPIs such as minimum and maximum
      throughput, delay, packet loss, etc.

7.1.2.  Management Use Case: Create or Terminate a Complete 3GPP Network
        Slice

   The operator creates a Complete 3GPP Network Slice by composing
   together smaller Network Slices together, which the highest level
   Network Slices being: a RAN Network Slice, a Core Network slice
   holding user plane (UPF) and control plane (SMF) network functions,
   as well common Core Network functions.  Those common core network
   functions (AMF, PCF, etc.) may be placed in multiple Network Slices
   since they can have different scaling properties.

   The Common CN Function Network Slices (including AMF) may be shared
   or dedicated to a given SMF.  In the shared case, there will be
   traffic flows terminated within a dedicated CN slice (e.g.  SMF) and
   the shared function.  RAN Slices may similarly be shared or
   dedicated.  In the shared case, each user traffic flow passing
   through a shared RAN slice will then pass through one out of multiple
   dedicated CN slices interconnected with this shared RAN Slice.  In
   both (RAN and CN) shared cases, there should be reserved resources
   within the shared Network Slice, to ensure that the whole flow has
   reserved resources.

   NS is not a required feature in 3GPP, especially not all Core Network
   functions are required to belong to a slice with a specified level of
   service.  In some cases, common network functions like AMF and PCF
   may be implemented outside of a Network Slice, or, equivalently, in a
   Network Slice with no specified QoS.

   A wide variation of cases, associating "n" Network Slices with "m"
   network services or applications involving "p" end devices, is
   supported.  For example: a single slice instance could be associated
   with multiple IoT applications, each connected to multiple devices.



de Foy & Rahman          Expires April 19, 2018                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft        Network Slicing 3GPP Use Case         October 2017


   In another example, an application may split its end users in 2
   service categories with different SLAs, using different Network Slice
   instances.

   Potential requirements:

   o  Network Slices can be composed of smaller Network Slices which can
      be dedicated or shared.

   o  Functions in Network Slices can interact with network functions
      outside of a Network Slice.

7.1.3.  Management Use Case: Activate or Deactivate a Complete 3GPP
        Network Slice

   Each Network Slice can be created in a deactivated state, and can be
   later switched between activated and deactivated state.  This can
   provide multiple advantages, e.g. speeding up procedures, and
   enabling using a pool of unused resources.  Activation or
   deactivation of a Complete 3GPP Network Slice can then be
   orchestrated as the activation (resp. deactivation) of individual
   Network Slices, possibly in a given order.

   Potential requirement:

   o  A slice can be created deactivated, and can be switched between
      activated and deactivated state.

7.1.4.  Management Use Case: Update a Complete 3GPP Network Slice

   The operator can modify the configuration (e.g. network or compute
   capacity or capability) of one of the Network Slices composing the
   Complete 3GPP Network Slice, while it is in use.  Example of such
   operations include:

   o  Increase the capacity of NFs

   o  Update the configuration of NFs

   o  Add, replace or remove a NFs

   o  Add, replace or remove a Network Slice

   Some operations affecting a shared slice may not be possible without
   affecting other Network Slices, and may be replaced by other
   operations: for example, instead of changing the configuration of a
   shared AMF to accommodate the needs of a SMF, another Network Slice




de Foy & Rahman          Expires April 19, 2018                [Page 14]

Internet-Draft        Network Slicing 3GPP Use Case         October 2017


   with an AMF may be created or activated, and replace the original
   AMF's slice for this SMF.

   Potential requirement:

   o  Ability to add, replace, remove NFs, and Network Slices without
      affecting service, assuming that the network service's design
      enables this.

7.1.5.  Management Use Case: Monitor Network Slices

   The 3GPP management system monitors performance of individual Network
   Slice level and coalesce performance data for the whole Complete 3GPP
   Network Slice.  Individual Network Slice level performance data is
   also useful to decide to scale up or down services within those
   slices.  Performance data (or events) includes user and control
   traffic load data.  It can also include QoS/SLA data, e.g. indicating
   whether services were provided at expected QoS/SLA level.  Alarms
   notifications can be individually enabled.  Events and alarms from a
   shared Network Slice contain enough information to be attributed by
   the 3GPP management system to one of the Complete 3GPP Network Slices
   that contain this shared Network Slice.

   Potential requirements:

   o  Performance monitoring (measure of KPIs and alarms) occurs at
      Network Slice level.

   o  Performance monitoring should be able to identify flows which are
      shared with other Network Slices, and enable matching performance
      data with those flows and Network Slices.

7.1.6.  Management Use Case: Slice Management Exposure

   3GPP networks may in some cases expose partial 3GPP Network Slice
   management to third party Communication Service Providers (CSP), who
   may in turn consume this service or provide it to their own
   customers.  Using this management interface a third party can request
   the creation of a Complete 3GPP Network Slice using specifications of
   NFs, isolation, security, performance requirements (such as traffic
   demand requirements for the coverage areas, QoS for service).

   When a 3GPP operator exposes management data (e.g. fault management
   data, performance data) about a Complete 3GPP Network Slice shared by
   multiple customers of a CSP, exposed management data of each customer
   is isolated from each other.

   Potential requirement:



de Foy & Rahman          Expires April 19, 2018                [Page 15]

Internet-Draft        Network Slicing 3GPP Use Case         October 2017


   o  Management data should enable identification of individual flows
      in such a way that it can be match to different customer groups.

7.1.7.  Management Use Case: Support for Multi-Domain Network Slice

   To support roaming, a 3GPP operator configures one or more Complete
   3GPP Network Slice to be selected to support roaming subscribers, to
   act as visited Complete 3GPP Network Slices.  Operators configure the
   interconnection of a home Complete 3GPP Network Slice in one domain
   and a visited Complete 3GPP Network Slice in the other domain.
   Performance data is sent from the visited domain to the control
   function in the home domain.

   Potential requirement:

   o  Support secure inter-domain interconnection for exchanging user
      plan traffic and performance data.

7.1.8.  Operational Use Case: Select Network Slices for a Device

   A subscriber's device initially connects to the network.  It sends,
   over a signaling path through the RAN, a message including a Network
   Slice Selection Assistance Information (NSSAI), which is a set of one
   or more tuples (slice type, slice differentiator).  The RAN selects
   an appropriate AMF and forwards the NSSAI to this function.  The AMF
   determines (possibly with the help of a Network Slice Selection
   Function) the set of allowed (slice type, slice differentiator) for
   this subscriber, using the NSSAI, device capabilities, subscriber's
   profile, and operator policy.  There is no physical resource
   reservation at this stage.

   Slice selection in this context is a preparation of control plane
   functions and may probably be considered out of scope for a general
   NS framework.  Therefore no potential requirements are derived from
   it.

7.1.9.  Operational Use Case: Create or Terminate a PDU Session

   At some point, the device needs a PDU session to transport flows for
   a specific application.  It sends, over a signaling path through the
   RAN, a PDU session establishment request to the AMF, typically
   including a tuple (slice type, slice differentiator) and a data
   network name.  If no such tuple is provided, the AMF will determine a
   default one to use.  The AMF will then determine which SMF (i.e.
   which Core Network Slice) to use, taking into consideration: the
   tuple (slice type, slice differentiator), data network name,
   subscription information, local operator policies and load conditions
   of the candidate SMFs.  If this is a home-routed roaming case, the

Internet-Draft        Network Slicing 3GPP Use Case         October 2017


   AMF will select a SMF in the visited network and another SMF in the
   home network.  The SMF selects the user plane function (UPF) that
   will handle the traffic, and transmits configuration information to
   this UPF (e.g. packet detection, QoS enforcement and reporting rules
   to be installed on the UPF for this PDU Session).

   Potential requirement:

   o  A network slice control API should enable installing new flows and
      associated reporting rules.

7.2.  Additional Discussion on Security Related Requirements

   In addition to potential requirements listed along with the use cases
   above, here is a list of additional discussion points related to
   security requirements and not directly described in a use case at
   this point:

   1.  3GPP architecture demonstrates a requirement for authenticating
       users of Network Slice resources (which may or may not be within
       the scope of an IETF framework).  There is however a need for
       separate per-slice security policies, e.g. having different
       authentication requirements between IoT and broadband.

   2.  Interoperation between Network Slices is a major risk factor on
       isolation and can occur in various scenarios:

       *  "Interoperation for extension" when data and control plane are
          interconnected for extending a slice between RAN and CN, or
          between visitor and home networks in a roaming scenario.

       *  "Interoperation through network function sharing" occurs in
          3GPP when some control planes functions are performed by
          common functions.

       *  "Interoperation through end points" can occur on user devices
          connected to multiple Network Slices, or on an application
          server side interacting with clients over different slices.

   3.  There is a strict requirement for security and performance
       isolation from data plane and control plane actions between
       slices.  Should Network Slices be allowed to tap into currently
       unused resource capacity?  There is a possible tradeoff here
       between performance/network efficiency and isolation, since in
       this case, through its normal operation, a slice may influence
       another slice by denying it this extra capacity.
