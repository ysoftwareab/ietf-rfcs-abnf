                  IPv6 RA Option for SIP Proxy Server
                   draft-boucadair-6man-sip-proxy-00

Abstract

   This document specifies a new optional extension to IPv6 Router
   Advertisement messages to allow IPv6 routers to advertise SIP Proxy
   Server addresses to IPv6 hosts.  The provisioning of the SIP Proxy
   Server address is crucial to access SIP-based services.  Means to
   ensure reliable delivery of this information to connecting SIP User
   Agents is a must.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft           RA for SIP Proxy Server                May 2011


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Needs

   Access to sensitive SIP-based service offering relies on the
   provisioning of the IP reachability information (IP address or FQDN)
   of the outbound SIP Proxy Server [RFC3261].  Two means have been
   defined in the past to provision such information:

   1.  DHCPv6 SIP options [RFC3319].

   2.  Dedicated 3GPP PCO to convey the address of the P-CSCF [CORE].

   Nevertheless, these means are not sufficient because of the following
   reasons:

   1.  PCO-IE is not mandatory in 3G networks (e.g., PCO information may
       not be supported by terminals);

   2.  DHCPv6 is not required in all 3GPP releases.  Moreover, the
       support of DHCPv6 client is not mandatory in the IETF IPv6 node
       requirements.

   3.  PCO-IE is not available in non-3GPP networks.  This is very
       critical when the UE performs a network attachment in a non-3GPP
       network because the user won't have access to SIP-based services
       if no alternative means are supported.

   As a conclusion, auto-configuration [RFC4861] is required so that a
   SIP UA can learn a set of SIP Proxy Servers.

1.2.  Scope

   Service providers need a reliable and flexible method to provision
   the SIP Proxy Server address(es) to UEs (User Equipments).  This
   document defines a new ND option called SIP Proxy Server option that
   contains the domain name of SIP Proxy Server(s).  This option follows
   the procedures defined in [RFC4861].  This works the same way that
   the hosts learn routers and prefixes.  The IPv6 host with SIP UA
   implemented can learn a list of SIP Proxy Servers elements thanks to
   this option.  The SIP Proxy Server option can be sent along with
   other options, such as DNS information [RFC6106], in the same RA
   message simultaneously.  The router sending the SIP Proxy Server in
   RA must be configured with the Proxy Server information.  The SIP
   Proxy Server RA option can be used on any network that supports ND.

2.  SIP Proxy Server Option

   The SIP Proxy Server Option contains a domain name representing the
   SIP outbound Proxy Server.  Figure 1 shows the SIP Proxy Server
   Option format.

                                 Figure 1

   Where

   o  Type is the RA SIP Proxy Server Option type

   o  Length is a 8-bit unsigned integer.  The length of the option is
      in unit of 8 octets.

   o  Reserved is for future use.

   o  Lifetime is a 16-bit unsigned integer.  The lifetime associated
      with the SIP Proxy Servers in units of seconds.

   o  SIP Server Domain Name: The domain names of the SIP outbound proxy
      servers for the client to use.  The domain names are encoded as
      specified Section 3.1 of [RFC1035].  Underlying name resolution
      libraries are used to resolve the name included in this option.

   Upon receipt of an RA SIP Proxy Server option, the IPv6 host MUST
   verify that the option length does not exceed 255 octets [RFC1035].
   The IPv6 host MUST verify the FQDN is a properly encoded as detailed
   in Section 3.1 of [RFC1035].  Once the FQDN conveyed in a SIP Proxy
   Server RA option is validated, the included name is passed to the
   name resolution library (see Section 6.1.1 of [RFC1123]) to retrieve
   the corresponding IP address.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to assign a new option code for:

   o  SIP Proxy Server


4.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any new security in addition to what
