1.  Introduction

   The Path Computation Element (PCE) architecture is defined in
   [RFC4655] for MPLS Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) and Generalized MPLS
   (GMPLS) networks.  The Path Computation Element Communication
   Protocol (PCEP) defined in [RFC5440] provides mechanisms for PCEs to
   perform path computations in response to Path Computation Clients
   (PCCs) requests.

   [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing] proposes extensions to PCEP that allow
   a stateful PCE to compute TE paths in segment routing (SR) networks.
   As defined in [I-D.ietf-spring-mpls-path-segment], a path segment is
   used to identify a SR path and support bidirectional SR paths
   correlation.  [I-D.li-pce-sr-path-segment] proposed the extension for
   PCEP to operate with Path Segment.  [I-D.li-pce-sr-bidir-path]
   proposed the extension for PCEP to group two unidirectional SR Paths
   into an Associated Bidirectional SR Path.
   [I-D.xiong-spring-path-segment-sr-inter-domain] proposes the use of
   Path Segment in inter-domain scenarios for SR-MPLS network.  It is
   required to perform the SR inter-domain path computation and
   initiation with PCE deployment.

Internet-Draft    Stateful PCE for SR-MPLS Inter-domain        July 2019


   The path computation requirments for Label Switched Paths (LSPs)
   across multiple domains are discussed in [RFC4105] and [RFC4216].
   Inter-domain path computation can be performed by a single stateful
   PCE and multiple stateful PCEs.  The PCE may has no ability to
   collect the topologies all over the domains.  So the single PCE model
   is not applied in deployment.  Three multiple PCEs models can be uesd
   to perform PCE-based inter-domain path computation including Per-
   Domain Path Computation [RFC5152], Backward-Recursive PCE-Based
   Computation (BRPC) [RFC5441] and Hierarchical PCE (H-PCE) [RFC6805].
   Computing the optimum inter-domain path requires co-operation between
   multiple PCEs.  But the sequence of domains need to be known before
   the path computation in BRPC mechanism.  Stateful H-PCE architecture
   is appropriate to compute an optimal end-to-end path across multiple
   domains.

   As defined in [I-D.xiong-spring-path-segment-sr-inter-domain], the
   SR-MPLS inter-domain models includes stitching and nesting inter-
   domain models between inter-Area or inter-AS domains.  This document
   proposes two solutions to perform the SR-MPLS inter-domain path
   computation and initiation with stateful PCEs and the use of Path
   Segment.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.2.  Terminology

   The terminology is defined as [RFC5440],
   [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing] , [I-D.ietf-spring-mpls-path-segment].

2.  The SR-MPLS Inter-domain with PCE

   The SR-MPLS inter-domain scenario is described in
   [I-D.xiong-spring-path-segment-sr-inter-domain].  The domains of the
   networks may be IGP Areas or ASes and the inter- domain scenario may
   be inter-Area or inter-AS.  The multiple SR-MPLS domains may be
   interconnect with a ABR within areas or inter-link between ASes.  As
   the Figure 1 shown, SR-AS1, SR-AS2 and SR-AS3 interconnect with
   logical links and SR-Area1, SR-Area2 and SR-Area3 interconnect within
   border nodes.  The SR end-to-end bidirectional LSP needs to be
   provided along the multi-domain paths.  The Path 1~5 are forwarding
   path segments and Path 1'~5' are the related reverse path segments
   and these are all inter-domain path segments.

             Figure 1 The SR Inter-Domain with H-PCE


   The hierarchical PCE architecture is described in [RFC6805], a parent
   PCE maintains a domain topology map that contains the child domains
   (seen as vertices in the topology) and their interconnections (links
   in the topology) but no information about the content of the child
   domains.  Each child domain has one PCE taking in charge of computing
   paths across its own domain.  These PCEs are known as child PCEs and
   have a relationship with the parent PCE.  As the Figure 1 shown,

Internet-Draft    Stateful PCE for SR-MPLS Inter-domain        July 2019


   H-PCE is parent PCE and PCE-1, PCE-2 and PCE-3 are child PCEs which
   is responsible for each own SR-AS.

   When an optimal inter-domain path is required, the ingress PCE sends
   a request to the parent PCE or the stateful parent PCE itself to
   initiate the path computation.  The parent PCE selects a set of
   candidate domain paths based on the domain topology and the state of
   the inter-domain links.  It then sends computation requests to the
   child PCEs responsible for each of the domains on the candidate
   domain paths.  The stateful child PCE in each domain performs active
   stateful procedure as defined [RFC8231].

2.1.  The Stitching LSP Association Solution

   The LSPs of multiple domains can be stitched together by adding them
   to a stitching LSP association group as defined in
   [I-D.hu-pce-stitching-lsp-association].  As the Figure 2 shown, the
   stateful H-PCE sends the PCInit message defined in [RFC8281] to
   initiate the inter-domain path computation adding the forwarding LSP
   1~3 to Assoc#1 and reverse LSP 1'~3' to Assoc#2.  The child PCEs may
   initiate the intra-domain LSPs when receiving the message from parent
   PCE.

2.2.  The Stitching Label Solution

   The Path Segment can be used for path stithing.  The SR sub-paths can
   be correlated with the use of Path Segment.  This section defined the
   path segments as stitching Labels which used to stitch per-domain LSP
   tunnels in order to create end-to-end path that cross multiple
   domains.

   SR intra-domain path is setup as part of inter-domain SR path.  When
   PCC requests the PCE or the PCE itself to initiate The SR path, the
   inter-domain path segments should be carried as a stitching Label
   with the associated link.

3.  Inter-domain Path Segment Allocation

   The inter-domain path segment may be allocated by PCC or PCE.  The
   PCE may be the single domain PCE which taking in charge of the
   respective domain.  The inter-domain path segments is a unique value
   in the domain which PCC or PCE belongs to.  The operation of path
   segment request and reply may be the same with that in single domain
   as defined in [I-D.li-pce-sr-path-segment].

3.1.  PCC Allocated

   As defined in [I-D.xiong-spring-path-segment-sr-inter-domain], an
   inter-domain path segment can be allocated by egress PCC and may be
   maintained on the PCC itself.  The inter-domain path segment connects



Quan Xiong, et al.       Expires January 8, 2020                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft    Stateful PCE for SR-MPLS Inter-domain        July 2019


   two domains and the ingress and egress PCC are belong to different
   domains.  The ingress and egress PCC need to exchange messages which
   carrying path segment information between the two PCEs.

   The Ingress PCC may request to allocate a path segment from egress
   PCC.  Once egress PCC allocated the inter-domain path segment, it
   need to inform the PCE in respective domain with the PCRpt message.
   The PCE need to communicate with the PCE which the ingress PCC
   belongs to inform the value allocated.

3.2.  PCE Allocated

   The ingress PCC may request the inter-domain path segment to be
   allocated by the PCE in PCC-Initiated LSP.  The PCE may allocate the
   inter-domain path segment on its own domain in PCEs-Initiated LSP.
   The allocated path segment needs to be informed to the ingress and
   egress PCC.

   The inter-domain path segments may be allocated separately by the
   PCEs which control the ingress and egress PCC along with the LSP
   initiation.

4.  PCEP Procedure

   [RFC8281] describes setup, maintenance and teardown of PCE-initiated
   LSPs under the stateful PCE model, without the need for local
   configuration on the PCC.  Similar to LSP updation, the inter-domain
   LSP can be initiated by the ingress PCE using the PCInitiate message
   to the ingress LSR.  The inter-domain path segment is viewed as
   stitching label.  Per-domain LSP may also be initiated by respective
   domain's PCE and stitched together.

4.1.  HPCE-initiated LSP

   In H-PCE [RFC6805] architecture, the parent PCE is used to compute a
   multi-domain path based on the domain connectivity information.  The
   stateful H-PCE in active model can be used to initiate the inter-
   domain bidirectional path for SR networks.  PCE sends PCInitiate
   message to its domain SR nodes with ERO={SID LIST} and carrying
   stitching association group TLV and path segments.  If the SR nodes
   is the border nodes of the SR domain, it correlates the two path
   segments and the related SID list if the related association ID is
   the same value.

   The PECP procedure for the HPCE-initiated LSP is following:






Quan Xiong, et al.       Expires January 8, 2020                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft    Stateful PCE for SR-MPLS Inter-domain        July 2019


   The stateful H-PCE initiates the end-to-end path computation across
   multiple domains and selects a set of candidate domain paths based on
   the topology.

   The stateful H-PCE sends PCInitiate message to every PCEs which the
   end-to-end path traversed, carrying inter-domain path segments
   allocated by H-PCE, stitching LSP association group and the SID list
   in the ERO object.

   The stateful child PCE in each domain perform active stateful
   procedure as defined in [I-D.li-pce-sr-path-segment].

4.2.  PCC-initiated LSP

   In case of passive path computation request to the ingress PCE from
   the ingress LSR, the H-PCE path computation procedure is applied to
   compute sequence of domains or end-to-end path by using PCReq and
   PCRep messages among stateful PCEs in passive mode.

   In case of delegation to the ingress PCE (active stateful PCE), the
   ingress child PCE may further delegate to parent PCE as per
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-hpce].  The parent PCE could update the path
   of the inter-domain LSP.

   The ingress nodes of the source AS sends the PCReq message to its
   PCE, then the PCE sends PCReq message to the H-PCE or stateful PCEs
   in other domains.  The PECP procedure for the PCC-initiated LSP in
   H-PCE model is as follow.

   The ingress PCC from the ingress domain sends a PCReq request to the
   PCE which is responsible for the domain containing the destination
   information.

   The ingress PCE sends the path computation request direct to the
   parent PCE.

   The parent PCE computes the optimal end-to-end path and initiates the
   inter-domain paths to the child PCEs which the path traversed.

   Each PCE sends PCInitiate message to ingress or egress nodes of its
   domain to initiate the LSPs.

5.  Security Considerations
