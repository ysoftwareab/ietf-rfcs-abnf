                  IS-IS Point-to-Multipoint operation
                      draft-lamparter-isis-p2mp-01

Abstract

   This document describes a new mode operation for IS-IS.  In addition
   to the existing LAN and point-to-point modes of operation, a point-
   to-multipoint mode is defined.  This mode is useful for operation
   both on networks with more than two routers where multicast is
   expensive in comparison to unicast, as well on networks where
   creating a LAN pseudonode cannot adequately reflect metrics.

1.  Introduction

   The core functionality of the protocol outlined in this document
   consists of an additional Subnetwork dependent function per Section 8
   of ISO/IEC 10589:2002 [IS-IS].  In that regard, the next section can
   be understood as new section "8.5 Point-to-multipoint networks".

   The outlined protocol is remotely similar to the derelict section
   "8.3 ISO 8208 subnetworks" [X.25] in that multiple point-to-point
   adjacencies are established on an interface.

   Point-to-multipoint operation of IS-IS is thus not a new idea; in
   fact section 6.2 already mentions "multipoint links."  This document
   re-enables the concept.

2.  Point-To-Multipoint Pseudocircuits

   In place of ISO 8473 call management [CLNS] establishing sessions,
   this document establishes pairwise "pseudocircuits" between two IS on
   a common medium.  Multiple such pseudocircuits can normally exist on
   one P2MP (Point-To-Multipoint) interface.

   Each pseudocircuit operates, aside from subnetwork attachment
   procedures, exactly as a P2P (Point-to-Point) link.

   It should be noted that while the Multicast autodiscovery mechanism
   requires broadcast capability, no other part of the protocol does.
   The P2MP interface type can be used on non-transitive and/or non-
   broadcast interfaces.

2.1.  Pseudocircuit behaviour

   An implementation maintains a set of pseudocircuits per P2MP
   interface.  Each pseudocircuit is uniquely identified by the local
   interface and peer's SNPA address.

   Each participating system MUST use a consistent SNPA address per
   local interface.  A change in SNPA address results in all neighbors
   treating the interface as distinct from the previous one.  A system
   MAY support multiple SNPA addresses per interface by treating them as
   distinct interfaces.

   Unnumbered media are not supported by this protocol.  Each
   participant on a link MUST have an unique SNPA address on that link.

2.1.1.  Representation in LSPs

   Pseudocircuits are represented in LSPs as a regular P2P circuit would
   be.  As a result, their treatment in SPF calculations is also
   identical to P2P circuits.

2.1.2.  Forwarding

   In scenarios where pseudocircuits do not form a full mesh of all
   participants on a medium, the best path for a packet may be through
   the same interface as the one it was received on.

   Systems implementing this specification MUST therefore support
   forwarding packets on the same interface that they were received on.
   This applies only to interfaces configured for P2MP operation.

2.2.  Neighbor IS discovery

   The discovery machinery produces as output a "candidate neighbor
   list," which is a list of possible neighbor's SNPAs and is maintained
   per P2MP interface.  Adding and removing entries to the candidate
   neighbor list results in pseudocircuit creation and deletion.

   A neighbors presence on the candidate list may be supported by
   multiple sources.  These sources are described in the following
   sections

   The IS-IS implementation SHOULD provide user configuration to disable
   or filter individual sources.

2.2.1.  Manual configuration

   A list of neighbor IS MAY be configured by the user, providing
   possible neighbor's SNPAs on an interface.

2.2.2.  Lower layer autodiscovery

   Lower protocol layers (VPLS, IEEE 802.11) may be able to provide a
   list of attached neighbors.  This list MAY be fed into the candidate
   neighbor list.

2.2.3.  Multicast autodiscovery

   For broadcast capable networks, this document defines an
   autodiscovery mechanism based on multicasting Hello packets.  This
   mechanism MAY be disabled by the user, but MUST be implemented for
   all lower layer link types with (limited or full) broadcast
   capability.

   A multicast autodiscovery packet is defined as a P2P IIH which is
   multicast over the LAN media as defined in [RFC5309].  Additionally
   it must include a Three-Way Adjacency TLV as defined in [RFC5303]
   indicating the circuit is in the DOWN state (i.e., 1 octet of value
   indicating the DOWN state).  Receiving such a Hello places the
   sending IS on the candidate list for as long as the PDU's holdtime
   indicates.

   A system MAY implement a receive-only passive multicast autodiscovery
   mode where it adds candidates (forms pseudocircuits) on receiving
   autodiscovery PDU, but does not send such PDUs itself.

   If either passive or full multicast autodiscovery is enabled,
   receiving a unicast autodiscovery PDU also adds the neighbor to the
   candidate list.

2.3.  Adjacency formation

   Since there may be no underlying protocol layer partitioning the link
   into actual P2P circuits in this case, additional handling is
   required on bringing up the individual pseudocircuit adjacencies.

   To prevent different pseudocircuits from "bleeding" into each other,
   implementations of this protocol MUST enable [RFC5303] on all P2MP
   pseudocircuits, with changes as follows:

   o  Received IIH PDUs on P2MP pseudocircuits without the Point-to-
      Point Three-Way Adjacency option MUST be discarded.

2.4.  Pseudocircuit teardown

   Pseudocircuits are destroyed when their P2P state machine has
   transitioned into "Down" state and they are no longer supported as a
   candidate by any discovery mechanism.

   As long as a pseudocircuit is present, its P2P state machine will, as
   expected for P2P circuits, trigger transmission of further Hello
   PDUs, even when it is in Down state.
