1.  Terminology


   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].


   To simplify discussions of the REFER method and its extensions, three
   new terms are being used throughout the document:
   o  REFER-Issuer: the UA issuing the REFER request
   o  REFER-Recipient: the UA receiving the REFER request
   o  REFER-Target: the UA designated in the Refer-To URI

3.  Using Feature Parameters with REFER


3.1  Introduction


   This document extends REFER method defined in RFC-3515 [3] to be used
   with feature parameters defined in [5].


3.2  Definition


   The Refer-To BNF from RFC-3515:


   Refer-To = ("Refer-To" / "r") HCOLON ( name-addr / addr-spec ) * (SEMI generic-param)


   is extended to:


   Refer-To = ("Refer-To" / "r") HCOLON ( name-addr / addr-spec ) * (SEMI refer-param)
   refer-param = generic-param / feature-param


   where feature-param is defined in Section 9 of  [5].


3.3  Examples


3.3.1  isfocus Usage


   The syntax below shows how the "isfocus" feature parameter can be
   used by REFER-Issuer to tell the REFER-Recipient that the
   REFER-Target is a conference focus and, consequently, sending an
   INVITE will bring the REFER-Recipient into the conference:


   Refer-To: sip:conf44@example.com;isfocus


3.3.2  Media Type Usage


   The syntax below shows how a REFER-Issuer can tell the
   REFER-Recipient that the REFER-Target supports audio and video and,
   consequently, that a video and audio session can be established by
   sending an INVITE to the REFER-Target:


   Refer-To: sip:videophone@example.com;audio;video

4.  Suppressing the REFER Implicit Subscription


4.1  Introduction


   The REFER specification specifies that every REFER creates an
   implicit subscription between the REFER-Issuer and the
   REFER-Recipient.  This document defines a new option tag,
   "norefersub", which specifies that an implicit subscription for event
   package refer should not be created as a result of accepting this
   REFER request.


4.2  Motivation


   The REFER specification mandates that every REFER creates an implicit
   subscription between the REFER-Issuer and the REFER-Recipient.  This
   subscription results in at least one NOTIFY being sent from the
   REFER-Recipient to the REFER-Issuer.  The REFER-Recipient may choose
   to cancel the implicit subscription with this NOTIFY.  The
   REFER-Issuer may choose to cancel this implicit subscription with an
   explicit SUBSCRIBE (Expires: 0) after receipt of the initial NOTIFY
   or by sending a 481 response to this initial NOTIFY request.


   One purpose of requiring the implicit subscription and initial NOTIFY
   is to allow for the situation where the REFER request gets forked and
   the REFER-Issuer needs a way to see the multiple dialogs that may be
   established as a result of the forked REFER.  This is the same
   approach used to handle forking of SUBSCRIBE [4] requests.  Where the
   REFER-Issuer explicitly specifies that forking not occur, the
   requirement that an implicit subscription be established is
   unnecessary.


   Another purpose of the NOTIFY is to inform the REFER-Issuer of the
   progress of the SIP transaction that results from the REFER at the
   REFER-Recipient.  In the case where the REFER-Issuer is already aware
   of the progress of the requested operation, such as when the
   REFER-Issuer has an explicit subscription to the dialog event package
   at the REFER-Recipient, the implicit subscription and resultant
   NOTIFY traffic related to the REFER can create an unnecessary network
   overhead.


4.3  Definition


   This document defines a new option tag, "norefersub", which specifies
   that an implicit subscription for event package refer should not be
   created as a result of accepting this REFER request.


   The "norefersub" option tag MUST be used by the REFER-Issuer only
   when the REFER-Issuer can be certain that the REFER request will not

Internet-Draft              REFER Extensions                   July 2004



   be forked.


   The REFER-Issuer can place the "norefersub" option tag either in the
   Require header or in the Supported header of the REFER request,
   subject to application requirements.


   If the REFER-Issuer inserts the option tag in the Supported header
   but the REFER-Recipient doesn't grant the suggestion, an implicit
   subscription is created as in default case.


   If the REFER-Issuer inserts the option tag in the Require header but
   the REFER-Recipient is not willing to grant the request, the REFER
   request is rejected.


   If the REFER-Recipient is willing to grant the "norefersub" behavior
   for the issued REFER request, it MUST insert a Supported: norefersub
   header in the 2xx response to the REFER-Issuer.  In this case no
   dialog is created.


4.4  Preventing Forking of REFER Requests


   The REFER specification allows for the possibility of forking a REFER
   request which is sent outside of an existing dialog.  The
   REFER-Issuer can ensure that REFER doesn't get forked by sending
   REFER to a REFER-Recipient which has GRUU properties according to
   definitions of [7].


4.5  Example


   An example of REFER which suppresses the implicit subscription is
   shown below:


   REFER sip:pc-b@tradewind.com SIP/2.0
   Via: SIP/2.0/TCP issuer.tradewind.com;branch=z9hG4bK-a-1
   From: <sip:a@tradewind.com>;tag=1a
   To: <sip:pc-b@tradewind.com>
   Call-ID: 1@issuer.tradewind.com
   CSeq: 234234 REFER
   Max-Forwards: 70
   Refer-To: <sip:c@tradewind.com;method=INVITE>
   Require: norefersub
   Accept-Contact: *;audio;require
   Contact: sip:a@issuer.tradewind.com
   Content-Type: message/sipfrag
   Content-Id: <1239103912039@issuer.tradewind.com>
   Content-Length: ...

5.  IANA Considerations


   This document defines a new option tag, "norefersub", which specifies
   that an implicit subscription for event package refer should not be
   created as a result of accepting this REFER request.  This option tag
   is only meaningful for the REFER request defined in RFC3515.

6.  Security Considerations


   This extension doesn't introduce new security threads beyond those
   identified and addressed in the core SIP specifications.
