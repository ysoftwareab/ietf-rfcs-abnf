Abstract

     IEEE Std 1394-1995 is a standard for a High Performance Serial Bus.
     Since 1394 uses different link-layer addressing method than
     conventional IEEE802/Ethernet, the usage of some fields must be
     clarified to achieve interoperability.
     This memo describes the 1394 specific usage of some fields of DHCP
     messages.

1. Introduction

   IEEE Std 1394-1995 is a standard for a High Performance Serial Bus.
   IETF IP1394 Working Group specified the method to carry IPv4
   datagrams and ARP packets over an IEEE1394 network [IP1394].

   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) [RFC2131] provides a
   framework for passing configuration information to hosts on a TCP/IP
   network.

   Since 1394 uses different link-layer addressing method than
   conventional IEEE802/Ethernet, the usage of some fields must be
   clarified to achieve interoperability.
   This memo describes the 1394 specific usage of some fields of DHCP.
   See [RFC2131] for the mechanism of DHCP and the explanations of each
   fields.

   This document is a product of the IP1394 working group within the
   Internet Engineering Task Force.  Comments are solicited and should
   be addressed to the working group's mailing list at
   ip1394@mailbag.intel.com and/or the author.

2. 1394 specific usage of DHCP message fields

   Following rules should be used when the DHCP client is connected to
   an IEEE1394 network.

   'htype' (hardware address type) should be 24 [ARPPARAM].

   'hlen' (hardware address length) should be 16.

   The format of the 'chaddr' (client hardware address) is specified as
   follows,
                            1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |             node_ID           |         unicast_FIFO_hi       |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                          unicast_FIFO_lo                      |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |    max_rec    |      spd      |            reserved           |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                           reserved                            |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The values of 'node_ID', 'unicast_FIFO', 'max_rec' and 'spd' sub-
   fields should be the same values used by ARP specified in [IP1394].
   A reserved field shall be zeroed. The recipient shall not check the

   value of a reserved field.

      NOTE: The usage of the 'node_ID' field is still under discussion
      within the working group.  According to the discussion for the
      virtual node ids in the IEEE P1394.1 Bridges Working Group, a node
      in the bridged IEEE1394 buses may have two node_IDs, one physical
      node_ID for local bus nodes and one virtual node_ID for remote bus
      nodes.

   'client identifier' option MUST be used in DHCP messages from the
   client to the server due to the transient nature of the 'node_ID'
   field in 'chaddr'.  'chaddr' will be used only to return a message
   from the server (or DHCP relay-agent) to the client.

   'client identifier' option may consist of any data.  When an EUI-64
   (node unique ID) [EUI64] is used as a 'client identifier', the type
   value for the EUI-64 is 27 [ARPPARAM], and the format is illustrated
   as follows.

       Code  Len   Type  Client-Identifier
      +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
      |  61 |  9  | 27  |           EUI-64 (node unique ID)             |
      +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

   Note that the use of other 'client identifier' type, such as a fully
   qualified domain name (FQDN), is not precluded by this memo.
   For more details, see "9.14. Client-identifier" in [RFC2132].
