FillOrder = 1, 2.  SHORT.
           TIFF Class F readers must be able to read data in both bit orders,
           but the vast majority of facsimile products store data LSB first,
           exactly as it appears on the telephone line.
                   1 = Most Significant Bit first.
                   2 = Least Significant Bit first.

ImageWidth = 1728, 2048, 2482, 2592, 3072, 3723, 3456, 4096, 4864.
           SHORT or LONG.  These are the fixed page widths in pixels.  The
           permissible values are dependent upon X and Y resolutions as shown
           in Table 2 of [T.4].
NewSubFileType = 2.  LONG.
           The value 2 identifies a single page of a multi-page image.

ResolutionUnit = 2,3.  SHORT.
           The units of measure for resolution:
               2 = Inch
               3 = Centimeter

XResolution = 204, 200, 300, 400, 406 (inches). RATIONAL.
YResolution = 98, 196, 100, 200, 300, 392, 400  (inches).  RATIONAL.
Compression = 3,4.  SHORT.
           This is a required Class F tag.  Modified Huffman, one-
           dimensional encoding with "byte-aligned" EOLs is selected by
           setting 3.  An EOL is said to be byte-aligned when Fill bits have
           been added as  necessary before EOL codes such that EOL always
           ends on a byte  boundary, thus ensuring an EOL-sequence of a 1
           byte preceded  by a zero nibble: xxxx0000 00000001.  The data in a
           Class F image is not terminated with an RTC (see sections 3.8.4
           and 3.8.5).  For two-dimensional encoding, set the value of the
           compression tag to 4 (see section 3.8.2).

T4Options = 4,5.  LONG.
           This tag is required for TIFF Class-F if the one-dimensional
           compression method has been specified (i.e. by setting the value
           of the Compression tag to 3).  Data is one-dimensional and EOLs
           must be byte-aligned. Uncompressed data is not allowed.
                  bit 0 = 0 for 1-Dimensional
                  bit 1 = must be 0 (uncompressed data not allowed)
                  bit 2 = 1 for byte-aligned EOLs

T6Options = 0  LONG.
           This tag is required for TIFF Class F if the two-dimensional
           compression method is specified (i.e. by setting the value of the
           Compression tag to 4).  Data is two-dimensional and there is no
           use of EOLs. Uncompressed data is not allowed. In earlier versions
           of TIFF, this tag was named Group4Options. The significance has
           not changed and the present definition is compatible.  This field
           is made up of a set of 32 flag bits. Unused bits must be set to 0.
           Bit 0 is the low-order bit. The default value is 0 (all bits 0).
                  bit 0 = 0 for 2-Dimensional
                  bit 1 = must be 0 (uncompressed data not allowed)

BitsPerSample = 1.  SHORT.
           Since facsimile is a black-and-white medium, this must be 1 (the
           default) for all files.

PhotometricInterp = 0,1.  SHORT.
           This tag allows notation of an inverted ("negative") image:
                   0 = normal
                   1 = inverted

SamplesPerPixel = 1.  SHORT.
           The value of 1 denotes a bi-level, grayscale, or palette color
           image.

Tag  = 326  (146 hex)
Type = SHORT or LONG

Tag = 327 (147 hex)
Type = SHORT
N = 0
               0 = Data contains no lines with incorrect pixel counts or
                  regenerated lines  (i.e., computer generated)
               1 = Lines with an incorrect pixel count were regenerated by
                  receiving device
               2 = Lines with an incorrect pixel count are in the data  and
                  were not regenerated by receiving device (i.e. data
                  contains bad scan lines)

Tag  = 328 (148 hex)
Type =  LONG or SHORT

CleanFaxData = 0, 1, 2.  BYTE.
           This tag indicates whether lines with incorrect pixel count are
           actually in the data or if the receiving facsimile device replaced
           them with regenerated lines.
                0 = Data contains no lines with incorrect pixel counts or
                    regenerated lines (i.e., computer generated)
                1 = Lines with an incorrect pixel count were regenerated by
                    receiving device
                2 = Lines with an incorrect pixel count are in the data and
                    were not regenerated by receiving device (i.e. data
                    contains bad scan lines)
