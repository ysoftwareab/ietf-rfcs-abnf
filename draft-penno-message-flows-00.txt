1. Introduction 

   This document shows the message flows associated with the most 
   relevant SPEERMINT routing architecture peering scenarios. Most of 
   the messages diagrams were based on previous work done by the SIP and 
   SIPPING working groups. 

   The document focuses on the messages exchanged for the purpose of 
   Layer 5 peering [7] between two domains. Messages exchanged for the 
   purposed of setting up SIP session within a domain are considered out 
   of scope and were already defined in other working groups.

   The draft separates the Layer 5 peering scenarios in two major 
   peering scenarios. 

   o  On-demand: In this scenario the SIP proxies in domains A and B 
      establish a peering relationship driven by the necessity to 
      deliver a SIP message to another domain. This is sometimes 
      referred as the email model.  

   o  Static: In this scenario the peering relationship between proxies 
      A and B is statically provisioned independent of the establishment 
      of any SIP session between users in different domains. 

   Normally, media for a given SIP session follows a different path, 
   traversing a different device (most commonly a router) when crossing 
   peering domains. Alternatively, media for a given session can be 
   directed to traverse the same device used for Layer 5 peering, i.e., 
   the same device that handles signaling when crossing domains. This 
   gives rises to two different models: 

   o  Decomposed: In this model SIP proxies perform Layer 5 peering and 
      media is sent directly between the UAs involved in the session. 
      Signaling and media follow different paths. 

   o  Collapsed: In this model the device that performs Layer 5 peering 
      also processes the associated media when crossing domains. In the 
      light of SPEERMINT these devices may need to process media mainly 
      when peering involves SIP entities in private address spaces. This 
      function is usually referred to as media relay and is usually 
      performed by a B2BUA or SBC (Session Border Controller). See [6] 
      for a complete discussion of SBC functions.  

   The decomposed or basic peering model picture is shown below. It is 
   worth mentioning that Proxy 1 and 2 can be separated by any number of 
   layer 3 hops. We will refer to this picture throughout this document.

2. Peering Message flows 

   We first depict what we call the basic message flow. The various 
   scenarios differ mostly of how and when peering is implemented. As 
   mentioned earlier peering can be establish following the arrival of a 
   message at a border proxy or statically following an agreement 
   between both domains.

   In the collapsed model, media would follow the path shown below. All 
   other signaling call flows remain the same, except a B2BUA is used 
   instead of a proxy.

   The following sections show the message flows in several different 
   scenarios broken in two categories, on-demand and static.  

3. On-Demand Peering 

   In the on demand peering scenario, the relationship between proxies 
   in domains A and B is driven by the arrival of a SIP message at proxy 
   A directed to a user in domain B (or vice-versa). 

3.1.1. Transport Layer Security 

   In this scenario, trust between domains A and B is implied by the TLS 
   connection. The TLS connection is only established as a result of the 
   first session between domains A and B.

   TBD: DNS exchange could present proxy 1 with a set of peering 
   policies that need to be met for the peering with proxy 2 two 
   succeed. 

3.1.2. Proxy Authentication 

   In this scenario we are assuming a new type Proxy authentication 
   method exists that allows mutual authentication between two proxies. 
   This authentication could be driven by a SIP session (on-demand) or 
   happen before any sessions

   Proposed OPTIONAL peering authentication requirements: 

   1. In order for a peering relationship to exist, both parties must 
      agree to the relationship.  To facilitate this, a common method 
      for the two peering proxies to authenticate with each other must 
      be defined. 
 
 
penno                  Expires October 10, 2006               [Page 10] 

Internet-Draft         SPEERMINT Message Flows               April 2006 
    

   2. The authentication method should utilize established SIP security 
      mechanisms if possible.   

   3. Upon authentication, the two parties must maintain an 
      authenticated state for continual bi-directional session 
      establishment.  This state must be challenged on a variable basis 
      in order to diminish man-in-the-middle (MIM) and external spoofing 
      attacks. 

   4. Upon an authentication request, a proxy must respond with either 
      an authentication failure response or a mutual (peer) 
      authentication attempt. 

   5. The authentication request must contain a timer, which allows the 
      peer to mutually authenticate within the specified timeframe.  
      Upon timer expiry, a new authentication dialog must be attempted. 

   6. If authentication fails, due to incorrect credentials; the proxy 
      must respond with a 401 Unauthorized message.  In this case, the 
      peering proxies are acting as registrars for peering proxy 
      relationships. 

   7. An authorization key must be exchanged by the peering proxies for 
      use within the applicable SIP messages.  This will be used to 
      validate the individual session's ability to progress to the pre-
      supposed user agent (UA) or user agent server (UAS).  This 
      eliminates the need for each session to be challenged, creating 
      unnecessary traffic congestion. 

   8. The authorization key must change upon the variable basis 
      established within requirement 3.  This additionally increases 
      security by diminishing MIM and external spoofing attacks. 

   9. Upon a peering authentication failure, even if by only one proxy 
      in the relationship; the peering relationship must be considered 
      at end and all authorization keys invalidated for new session 
      attempts. 

   10.If a peering relationship is terminated due to any reason, 
      existing sessions must be maintained until either the peering 
      relationship is re-established or the session is ended. 

   11.The authorization keys from both peering proxies must be 
      maintained and viable for use throughout sustained sessions until 
      the sessions have ended.  This allows applicable user agents to 
      offer additional session changes such as RE-INVITE even if the 
      peering relationship has been terminated.

Internet-Draft         SPEERMINT Message Flows               April 2006 
    

   12.In the case of authorization key failure, the proxy associated 
      with the failure must respond with a 407 Proxy Authentication 
      Required message associated with the session.       

   13.Upon authorization key failure, the proxy associated with the 
      failure must challenge the peering proxy and update the related 
      key for use in future session validation.   

4. Static Peering 

   In the static peering scenario the relationship between proxies A and 
   B is not driven by a SIP session, but before hand through manual 
   provisioning.  

4.1.1. IPSec 

   In this model an IPSec connection between proxies A and B is 
   provisioned following an agreement between the two domains.

4.1.2. Co-Location

   location and/or are member of a segregated network. In this case 
   messages between Proxy 1 and Proxy 2 would be sent as clear text.

5. Considerations on Private IP addresses 

   In Layer 5 peering scenarios, it does not really matter if the 
   peering fabric is public or private. What is relevant is if one of 
   the SIP devices participating in the session is in a public address 
   space and the other in a private.   

   In this case some observations should be made: 

   o  A SIP device in a private address space can only communicate with 
      a device in a public address space if a NAT binding from private 
      to public address is provided. 

   o  If a SIP device is in a private address space behind legacy NAT 
      device and does implement a NAT traversal method [8], media relay 
      might be needed for the successful establishment of the session. 
      Media relay is most commonly implemented by a B2BUA or SBC. A 
      legacy Nat is one that does not implement a SIP Application Level 
      Gateway (ALG).[4]

6. Considerations on Media Flows 

6.1. Decomposition 

   The scenarios in the previous sections show media flowing between the 
   endpoints involved in the SIP session, but it is important to 
   understand that the domains involved in peering might not carry the 
   media associated with such sessions. 

   Media associated with the sessions established across the peering 
   interface could be carried by a traditional ISP. The picture below 
   depicts such scenario.  

                                 +---------+    _________ 
                            /--->|   VSP   |<-----\ 
                           /     |         |       \ 
                          |      +---------+       | 
                Signaling |                        | Signaling 
                (peering) |                        | (peering) 
                          |                        | 
         +------------+   |                        |   +------------+ 
         |            |<-/      +-----------+_      \->|            | 
         |            |         |           |          |            | 
         | Domain A   |>------->|    ISP    |>-------->| Domain B   | 
         |            |<-------<|___________|<--------<|            | 
         |____________|  Media  |           |   Media  |____________| 
         +------------+         +-----------+          +------------+ 
    

6.2. QoS  

   Media flows for real time communication usually need strict 
   scheduling guarantees in order to not degrade the service. The 
   problem of QoS within an independent administratively domain and 
   across domains is quite different.  

   In the case L5 peering several issues arise around QoS for media 
   flows, especially in the case of on-demand peering. Some of these 
   issues are listed below. 

   o  How to reconcile general QoS parameters used in domain A across 
      the peering interface with those announced by domain B's peering 
      policy? 




 
 
penno                  Expires October 10, 2006               [Page 14] 

Internet-Draft         SPEERMINT Message Flows               April 2006 
    

   o  How domain B can identify media flows crossing the peering 
      interface coming from domain A (and vice-versa) in order to 
      provide the agreed upon QoS treatment? We could potentially be 
      talking about hundreds of call (and consequently new media flows) 
      per second. 

   o  Moreover, in a decomposed scenario, how the SIP Proxy can let the 
      router know the identity of such media flows and the QoS 
      parameters associated with it? This problem was discussed under 
      the TISPAN umbrella and NGN networks [6]. 

   o  Alternatively or in conjunction with dynamic identification there 
      is the issue of trust. Possibly domain B could trust domain A to 
      mark all media packets appropriately. Domain B would honor such 
      markings and give the appropriate treatment announced on its 
      peering policy 

7. Considerations on Multilateral Peering 

   Some of the difficulties discussed in previous sections would be 
   aggravated in the case of multilateral on-demand peering where 
   potentially more than on VSP could carry signaling (and possibly 
   media) to reach a specific endpoint.  

   How peering policies could be compared to find out the best one for a 
   specific case? In the case of routing protocols a combination of 
   metrics, route filtering and others techniques provide a solution.  

                          +---------+ 
                          |         | 
                        / | Domain  |\  
                       /  |    C    | \  
                      /   |         |  \ 
                     /    +---------+   \ 
                    /                    \ 
     +--------+    /      +---------+     \     +--------+       +-----+ 
     |        |---/       |         |      \----|        |       |     | 
     | Domain |           | Domain  |           | Domain |       | UA  | 
     |   A    |-----------|    B    |-----------|    D   |-------|     |             
     |        |           |         |           |        |       +-----+ 
     +--------+           +---------+           +--------+        
    

8. Security Considerations 

   The level of security required during the establishment and 
   maintenance of a SIP peering relationship between to proxies can vary 
 
 
penno                  Expires October 10, 2006               [Page 15] 

Internet-Draft         SPEERMINT Message Flows               April 2006 
    

   greatly. In general all security considerations related to the SIP 
   protocol are also applicable in a peering relationship. 

   If the two proxies communicate over an insecure network, and 
   consequently are subject to attacks, the use of a TLS or IPSec would 
   be advisable. 

   If there is physical security and the proxies are co-located, or the 
   proxies are situated in a segregated network (such as VPN), one could 
   argue that basic filtering based on IP address is enough.  

9. IANA Considerations 

   There are no IANA considerations at this point 

10. Conclusions 

   The purpose of this draft is to show SPEERMINT message flows as 
   specified in charter but also to raise awareness through questions 
   and detailed considerations of several issues the WG might have to 
   deal in different peering scenarios.
