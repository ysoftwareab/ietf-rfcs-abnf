Internet-Draft  Automatic method for the Minimization     February 2008 
                   of Extraneous Pseudonodes in IS-IS 

1. Introduction 

   When Ethernets were originally introduced as a type of link, the 
   assumption was that an "Ethernet" was assumed to be a large cloud 
   with many directly connected nodes. Given that the overhead of a link 
   state protocol (such as IS-IS or OSPF) is proportional to the number 
   of links in the topology, a cloud with a lot of neighbors, 
   represented in the most straightforward way, as having all nodes on 
   the cloud being fully connected, would represent n^2 links. Thus to 
   make large shared links scalable, the concept of a "pseudonode" 
   (Pseudonode) was introduced. If there are n neighbors on an Ethernet, 
   rather than representing the connectivity between the neighbors as 
   n^2 links, one router on the Ethernet is elected Designated Router, 
   and that router impersonates the cloud itself, issuing link state 
   information on behalf of the cloud, and each router on the cloud (in 
   addition to the Designated Router) claims only the pseudonode as a 
   neighbor. The "pseudonode" is the cloud itself. In this way the 
   pseudonode will have n router neighbors, but each router will only 
   report a single neighbor (the pseudonode). 

   However, Ethernet has evolved into "switched Ethernet", where instead 
   of Ethernet being a large cloud, it is often as small as a single pt-
   to-pt link connecting exactly two neighbors. An Ethernet might even 
   be a pt-to-pt link between a router and an endnode. It would be 
   wasteful to represent such a link as a pseudonode. 

   This paper presents a method that allows a Designated Router running 
   OSPF to decide when it is appropriate to represent an Ethernet as a 
   pseudonode, and generate a Pseudonode and when it is appropriate 
   instead to represent the topology as direct connections between all 
   the nodes on the cloud. This is automatic and non disruptive to the 
   rest of the network if routers on the cloud fail and reappear. 

1.1. Method 

   To implement this technique, each link state router on a single 
   broadcast segment would set a bit indicating it supports the 
   technique as described in this document 

   If every router on the link claims the ability to represent the 
   broadcast link without a pseudonode, then the Designated Router 
   specifies to the routers on the link whether the link will be 
   represented by a pseudonode or not. The actual algorithm chosen by 
   the DR need not be the same for all routers. A router MAY be 
   configured with a different algorithm, or experience may show that a 
   different algorithm might be more optimal. Since the DR decides on 
   behalf of the link, whether it will be represented with a pseudonode, 
 
 
Perlman et al          Expires August 18, 2008                 [Page 3] 

Internet-Draft  Automatic method for the Minimization     February 2008 
                   of Extraneous Pseudonodes in IS-IS 

   or as fully connected direct links between each pair of routers, 
   there is no need for all routers to have the same algorithm. The only 
   requirement is that a router follow the mandate of the DR. 

   The algorithm in this document is that the DR mandates use of a 
   pseudonode if there are at least 4 routers on the link (including the 
   DR), and mandates no pseudonode if there are only 2 routers on the 
   link (including the DR). If there are 3 routers on the link 
   (including the DR), the DR does not change the state of the link. So 
   if there are 4 routers on the link, the link will be represented by a 
   pseudonode. If one of those routers go down, the link will remain 
   represented by a pseudonode. Only when two of the four routers go 
   down, so that the DR has only one neighbor, will the DR revert to "no 
   pseudonode". When the DR has specified that the link is not to be 
   represented by a pseuonode, the link will remain as "no pseudonode" 
   until there are again 4 or more routers on the link. 

2. Generic changes 

   1. The Hello message on a broadcast link must contain a flag 
      specifying the ability of the transmitting router to do pseudonode 
      minimization. 

   2. The Hello message on a broadcast link must contain a flag set by 
      the DR to indicate that the link is not to be represented by a 
      pseudonode. If the link is not to be represented by a pseudonode, 
      then there is no need to give a name to the pseudonode. 

   3. The DR must check the "pseudonode minimization capable" of all 
      routers on the link. If any router does not advertise this 
      ability, the DR MUST represent the link with a pseudonode. 

   4. If the link is not to be represented by a pseudonode, then all 
      routers on the link will report direct pt-to-pt / p2mp links about 
      each other router on the link. The DR remains in place and 
      flooding continues on the network itself as normal. 

   5. If all routers on the link are "pseudonode minimization capable", 
      then the DR specifies that the link will not use a pseudonode if 
      the number of routers on the link is 2 or fewer (i.e. the DR has 
      at most one router neighbor). 

   6. If there are at least 4 routers on the link (i.e., the DR has at 
      least 3 router neighbors), then the DR specifies use of a 
      pseudonode for the link.

                   of Extraneous Pseudonodes in IS-IS 

   7. If there are 3 routers on the link, then the DR does not change 
      the state of the link. 

   8. If a non compatible router appears on the link then the DR signals 
      to the other routers to no longer perform pseudonode minimization 

3. IS-IS Considerations and process 

3.1. Link attribute Sub-TLV 19 

   It is proposed to utilize 2 flag values from Sub-TLV 19[RFC5029]. 
   Sub-TLV 19 RFC5029 is a type 22 TLV [RFC3784]. 
   It is our recommendation in this draft that we register bit 3 (NS-
   Bit) and bit 4 (SS-Bit), for use within the sub-TLV Flag field. 
   Currently the first two bits have been allocated. IANA states that 
   'further values are to be allocated by the Standards Action process 
   defined in [RFC2434], with Early Allocation (defined in 
   [RFC4020])permitted.' 

3.2. Initial DR Election 

   It is envisioned that this will stay the same except for the 
   following setting of two newly allocated flags in the Sub-TLV field. 

   1. The NS-Bit; Pseudonode suppression capability supported bit, is 
      to be assigned in the Sub-TLV field [RFC5029] The setting of this 
      bit can be seen in the ISIS Hello. Setting of the NS-Bit implies 
      compliance with this pseudonode reduction draft 

   2. The SS-Bit; Pseudonode suppression signal, is to be assigned in 
      the Sub-TLV field [RFC5029]. The setting of this bit can be seen 
      in the ISIS Hello. This bit is set to allow the DR to indicate to 
      the routers on the Broadcast LAN that pseudonode reduction is 
      required. 

   Hellos are sent as usual with DR election taking place. If all of the 
   routers on the LAN signify via NS-Bit that they are capable of this 
   feature, AND if the DR decides to implement pseudonode suppression, 
   then the DR signals this to the routers on the Ethernet via the 
   setting of the SS-Bit. If the other routers all respond with the SS-
   Bit set, then the LSP migration starts. 

3.2.1. Changing reported link types to P2P 

   The other routers must follow the DR and reset the network type 
   advertised in their LSP to P2P for each neighbor

Internet-Draft  Automatic method for the Minimization     February 2008 
                   of Extraneous Pseudonodes in IS-IS 

3.3. Overview of IS-IS States 

   State1: ISIS has elected a DR. The DR noted that the NS-Bit was set 
   on all neighbors indicating compliance with this draft. A network LSA 
   has NOT yet been generated or advertised by the Designated Router. 

   State2: If required, the DR signals pseudonode suppression by setting 
   the SS-Bit. If ALL of the routers respond to the DR by setting the 
   SS-Bit, then state 3.  

   State3:         

   o  All routers attached to the network advertise the network type in 
      their LSP as multiple P2P connections and not broadcast. (This 
      ensures that remote routers are not expecting a pseudonode. This 
      allows the feature to be compatible with non pseudonode reduction 
      capable routers.) 

   o  The DR suppresses advertising a pseudonode for the network. 

   o  Despite remotely representing the Ethernet as a series of P2P 
      connections, the network itself still operates as a broadcast 
      Ethernet. The DR continues to control the flooding process and the 
      ISIS hellos on the network remain unchanged. 

    

3.3.1. A router changes advertised support for Pseudonode reduction 

   Any changes to the advertised support for Pseudonode reduction Sub-
   TLV flags should be handled in the same way as changes to the 
   advertised router capabilities [ISIS] 

3.3.2. Addition of a router that supports pseudonode reduction 

   If a further router is added to the network and indicates compliance 
   with pseudonode reduction by the setting of the NS-Bit in the hello 
   packets, then the DR responds with the SS-Bit set as expected. If the 
   new neighbor responds with the SS-Bit also set then operations 
   continue as in state 3. No timer is required, with the router 
   advertising the multiple P2P connections in the network type in the 
   LSP. 

3.3.3. Addition of a router that does not support pseudonode reduction 

   If a new router is added to a network that is implementing pseudonode 
   reduction and does NOT support this feature then: 
 
 
Perlman et al          Expires August 18, 2008                 [Page 6] 

Internet-Draft  Automatic method for the Minimization     February 2008 
                   of Extraneous Pseudonodes in IS-IS 

   The DR signals to the other routers on the network the resetting of 
   the SS-Bit flag. A 30 second pseudonode-reduction timer starts. 
   Routers signify complicity with the change back to Broadcast type by 
   resetting their SS-Bit in accordance with the DR. The current graph 
   is retained for routing calculations while a new graph is built. 

   If after expiration of the pseudonode-reduction timer all routers are 
   still advertising reset SS-Bit in agreement, then the migration back 
   is considered as stable, and the network type is advertised 
   simultaneously in the normal LSP as a broadcast OSPF type. 

   If a router has failed to reset the SS-Bit flag within the 
   pseudonode-reduction timer, then neighbor state is reset as per 
   [ISIS]. 

4. Security Considerations 

   A group of 3 routers could maliciously come up and down as a group, 
   or a single router could pretend to be 3 routers, and cause the 
   pseudonode state of the link to oscillate. Also, a malicious DR can 
   oscillate the state of the link. A single router could oscillate the 
   state of the link by advertising first that it is capable of 
   pseudonode minimization, and then advertising that it is not capable. 
   However, any disruption to routing by a router using any of these 
   strategies can already be done trivially by, for instance, pretending 
   to be highest priority and taking over as DR, and then changing 
   identity and the pseudonode name. So the capability in this document 
   does not make it any easier for a malicious router on a link to cause 
   disruption. 

5. IANA Considerations 

   The Early Assignment of 2 flags, NS-Bit and SS-Bit required from 
   Sub-TLV 19 [RFC5029] 

6. Acknowledgments 

   We thank Mike Shand for doing the math to show that the link state 
   database in IS-IS becomes smaller with use of a pseudonode on a link 
   with at least 4 routers.
