Abstract

   This document defines a set of structured requirements whereby a
   watcher information subscriber (client) may select specific
   information to be received in the watcher infomation notification
   sent by the notifier (server). The purpose is to limit the content so
   that only essential information is delivered by the server.

Internet-Draft        Winfo Filtering Requirements              May 2003


1. Introduction

   SIP event notification is described in [4]. It defines a general
   framework for subscriptions and notifications for SIP event packages.
   Concrete applications of the general event framework to a specific
   group of events are described in [3] (user presence) and [5] (watcher
   information).

   The watcher information refers to the set of users subscribed to a
   particular resource within a particular event package. Watcher
   information changes dynamically as users subscribe, unsubscribe, are
   approved, or rejected. A client can subscribe to this information.

   As the inherent usage of event packages grows, the client needs some
   mechanisms for controlling the event notifications at the source.
   Evidence of this need is found in [2].

   The Internet Draft describing the watcher information template
   package [5] mentions the possibility for filtering. Accordingly, the
   SUBSCRIBE request may contain a body for filtering the watcher
   information subscription. However, the definition of filtering has
   been left out of the scope of the Internet Draft.

   These mechanisms are expected to be particularly valuable to users of
   wireless devices. The characteristics of these devices typically
   include low bandwidth, low data processing capabilities, small
   display and limited battery power. Such devices can benefit from the
   ability to filter the amount of information generated at the source
   of the event notification.

   However, it is expected that the control mechanisms for event
   notifications add value for all users irrespectively of their device
   or network access characteristics.

   Section 3 and Section 4 of this draft propose a set of requirements
   whereby a client may specify which notifications it is interested in.
   That is, a means to specify filtering rules to be executed by the
   server. Section 6 provides a few example applications of notification
   filtering.

2. Conventions

   In this document, the key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED',
   'SHALL', 'SHALL NOT', 'SHOULD', 'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED', 'MAY',
   and 'OPTIONAL' are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1]
   and indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations.

3. Requirements for Specification of Filters

   The following requirements relate to the creation of filters (rules).

3.1 Common Syntax

   A common set of constructs MUST be defined for the creation of rules.
   There MUST be a common set of operations that follow a common syntax.
   The client MUST be possible to define different rules for different
   purposes using a common filtering mechanism.

3.2 Package Identification

   A means is REQUIRED whereby the client may specify the package the
   rules apply to.

3.3 Target URI

   It MUST be possible for the client to indicate the target user to
   which a certain filter criteria is applied.

3.4 Notification Content Limiting

   This chapter presents requirements for specifying the content to be
   sent in the notifications.

   It MUST be possible for the client to specify the watcher XML
   elements [6] to be delivered in the notification.

   It MUST be possible to specify logical expressions based on the value
   of elements defined in the template-package for the purpose of
   determining what to send in the notification.

   It MUST be possible to construct expressions that combine multiple
   tests.

3.4.1 Status

   The client MUST be able to indicate to the server to include only
   those watchers in the notifications which are in a specific status.

3.4.2 Event Causing the Transition

   The client MUST be able to indicate to the server to include only
   those watchers in the notifications which are transitioned in their
   current status because of a specific event.

3.4.3 Expiration

   The client MUST be able to indicate to the server to include only
   those watchers in the notifications which have subscription lifetime
   higher than (less than) a specific amount of seconds.

3.4.4 Duration of Subscription

   The client MUST be able to indicate to the server to include only
   those watchers in the notifications which are subscribed for a
   duration higher than (less than) a specific amount of seconds.

3.4.5 Selected Watchers

   The client MUST be able to indicate to the server to include only
   certain watchers (e.g. watchers from a particular domain, specific
   watchers defined by the filters) in the notifications.

4. Requirements for Uploading Rules (Operational Rules)

   It MUST be possible for the client to upload the rules to the server
   and know the status - accepted or rejected.

4.1 SUBSCRIBE Method

   Placing filtering rules in the body of the subscription MUST be
   supported.

4.1.1 Retention of Filter Settings

   The server MUST retain the uploaded filter setting for the duration
   of the subscription.

4.1.2 Changing Filter Settings

   It MUST be possible to change the filter settings during a
   subscription.

   It MUST be possible for the client to reset the filter settings to
   the service (server) defined default.

4.2 Server does not Support Filters

   If the server does not support filters (the content type) then it
   MUST be able to indicate so in a response.

4.3 Server does not Support Filter Settings

Internet-Draft        Winfo Filtering Requirements              May 2003


   It MUST be possible for the server to explicitly indicate that it
   does not support or understand the filter settings. This indication
   MAY include a reason about the refusal of the filter settings.

4.4 Server can no Longer Support Filter Settings

   The server MUST be able to terminate the subscription if the active
   filter is no longer applicable due to a policy in the server.

5. Security Considerations

   Further security requirements over [3] have not yet been identified.

6. Example Applications for Notification Filtering

   1.  A presentity wishes to see who has subscribed to their presence.
       The presentity only wishes to see information for subscribers who
       are co-workers.

   2.  A presentity makes subscription to get information about active
       watchers.

   3.  A presentity makes subscription to get information about defined,
       new or unauthorised watchers.

   4.  A presentity requests history information of watchers.
