   examples cover both version 2 and version 3.  The purposes of this
   draft is to give developers of tools that process v2 and/or v3
   documents a corpus to test against.

1.  Introduction

   This document gives examples of use of the "XML2RFC" vocabulary.  The
   examples cover both version 2 [XML2RFCv2] and version 3 [XML2RFCv3].
   The purpose of this document is to help developers of tools that
   process v2 and/or v3 documents to see examples of the documents.

   Earlier versions of this document said that it was to help people
   with v2 documents transition to v3.  The authors have backed off from
   that goal.  Instead, we point out that the changes from v2 to v3 are
   listed in detail in Section 1.2 of [XML2RFCv3].  Also, we expect that
   there will be additional documents created later describing the
   v2-to-v3 conversion, as well as tools that will do as much of the
   conversion as possible.

   This is meant to be a short-lived document.  It is not expected that
   this document will be published as an RFC.

2.  Example of a v2 Document

   The following is a v2 document that has all the elements that are
   needed for typical Internet-Drafts.
