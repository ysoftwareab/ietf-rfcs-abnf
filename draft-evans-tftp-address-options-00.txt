Internet-Draft            TFTP Address Options             November 2005


1.  Introduction

   The Trivial File Transfer Protocol [2] (TFTP) is a simple protocol
   that allows a client to read a file from, or write a file to, a
   remote server.

   In some networks, a proxy relays requests and responses between a
   TFTP client and a TFTP server.  A router may also be present between
   the client and the server.  In these cases, addressing information
   that identifies the client and that may be required by the server for
   authentication, file-generation or other purposes may not be readily
   available to the server.  The options defined in this document allow
   the client or the proxy to provide the needed address(es) to the
   server.

   The general mechanism used for adding options to TFTP messages is
   described in [4].


2.  Terminology

   The key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL in this document are to be
   interpreted as described in [3].


3.  Format of the Hardware Address option

   The TFTP Read Request or Write Request packet is modified to include
   the hwaddr option.  All named fields except "opc" are followed by a
   single-octet field containing the value zero.

         +-------+---~~---+---+---~~---+---+---~~---+---+---~~---+---+
         |  opc  |filename| 0 |  mode  | 0 | hwaddr | 0 |   ha   | 0 |
         +-------+---~~---+---+---~~---+---+---~~---+---+---~~---+---+

   opc                 The opcode field contains either a 1, for Read
                       Requests, or 2, for Write Requests, as defined in
                       [2].
   filename            The name of the file to be read or written, as
                       defined in [2].
   mode                The mode of the file transfer: "netascii",
                       "octet", or "mail", as defined in [2].
   hwaddr              The Hardware Address option, containing the case-
                       insensitive string "hwaddr" in ASCII.

   ha                  A hardware address.  The format of hardware
                       addresses is defined in Section 4.


4.  Format of the Hardware Address

   A hardware address comprises two comma-separated ASCII fields:
   hardware type and the address value.

   hardware type       A number representing the type of the hardware
                       address.  This document defines a single value,
                       "1", representing an Ethernet address.
   address value       A representation of the hardware address.  This
                       document defines a single format, to be used in
                       the case that the hardware type has the value
                       "1".  In this case, that address MUST be an
                       Ethernet MAC address in the case-insensitive form
                       "xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx".


5.  Format of the Network Address option

   The TFTP Read Request or Write Request packet is modified to include
   the netaddr option.  All named fields except "opc" are followed by a
   single-octet field containing the value zero.

         +-------+---~~---+---+---~~---+---+---~~---+---+---~~---+---+
         |  opc  |filename| 0 |  mode  | 0 | netaddr| 0 |   na   | 0 |
         +-------+---~~---+---+---~~---+---+---~~---+---+---~~---+---+

   opc                 The opcode field contains either a 1, for Read
                       Requests, or 2, for Write Requests, as defined in
                       [2].
   filename            The name of the file to be read or written, as
                       defined in [2].
   mode                The mode of the file transfer: "netascii",
                       "octet", or "mail", as defined in [2].
   netaddr             The Network Address option, containing the case-
                       insensitive string "netaddr" in ASCII.
   na                  A network address.  The format of network
                       addresses is defined in Section 6.


6.  Format of the Network Address

   A network address comprises two comma-separated ASCII fields: network
   type and the address value.

   network type        A number representing the type of the network
                       address.  This document defines two values: "1"
                       represents an IPv4 address; "2" represents an
                       IPv6 address.
   address value       A representation of the network address.  This
                       document defines two formats.  If the network
                       type has the value "1", the network address MUST
                       be a dotted decimal IPv4 address as defined in
                       [1] .  If the network type has the value "2", the
                       network address MUST be a case-insensitive IPv6
                       address in one of the formats specified by
                       section 2.2 of [5].


7.  Option Acknowledgement

   [4] allows for the possibility that TFTP options will be acknowledged
   explicitly with an OACK packet.  A TFTP server SHOULD NOT respond to
   the presence of a valid Hardware Address option or Network Address
   option by sending an OACK as defined in [4].


8.  Errors

   [4] allows for the possibility that TFTP options will contain errors.
   For the options defined in this document, the server SHOULD return a
   TFTP ERROR message with ErrorCode value 8 if any of the following
   occurs:

   1.  An error when parsing an option;
   2.  An unknown hardware or network type;
   3.  An incorrectly formatted hardware or network address.


9.  Security Considerations

   TFTP provides no security safeguards; it relies on other layers to
   provide appropriate security where necessary.  This document does not
   introduce any additional safeguards into TFTP.  In the absence of
   other security measures, several possibilities exist for
   inappropriate behaviour:

   o  A client could populate the options defined in this document with
      incorrect but legal values, which could cause the TFTP server to
      behave in an undesirable manner (for example, it might report an
      incorrect hardware address to a backoffice system).

   o  An attacker could replace correct option values with incorrect
      ones.
   o  An attacker could insert incorrect option values into a request
      that originally did not use the options defined in this document.
   o  An attacker could return an ERROR message to the client even
      though there was no ERROR in the request.
   o  An attacker could insert an option into a reply that did not
      originally contain that option.


10.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.
