1.  Introduction

   Domain Name Registries (DNRs) may operate in special modes for
   certain periods of time enabling trademark holders to protect their
   rights during the introduction of a Top Level Domain (TLD).

   Along with the introduction of new generic TLDs (gTLD), two special
   modes came into effect:

   o  Sunrise Period, the Sunrise Period allows trademark holders an
      advance opportunity to register domain names corresponding to
      their marks before names are generally available to the public.

   o  Trademark Claims Period, the Trademark Claims Period follows the
      Sunrise Period and runs for at least the first 90 days of an
      initial operating period of general registration.  During the
      Trademark Claims Period, anyone attempting to register a domain

      name matching a mark that is recorded in the ICANN Trademark
      Clearinghouse (TMCH) will receive a notification displaying the
      relevant mark information.

   This document describes the requirements, the architecture and the
   interfaces between the ICANN TMCH and Domain Name Registries (called
   Registries in the rest of the document) as well as between the ICANN
   TMCH and Domain Name Registrars (called Registrars in the rest of the
   document) for the provisioning and management of domain names during
   the Sunrise and Trademark Claims Periods.

   For any date and/or time indications, Coordinated Universal Time
   (UTC) applies.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   XML is case sensitive.  Unless stated otherwise, XML specifications
   and examples provided in this document MUST be interpreted in the
   character case presented in order to develop a conforming
   implementation.

   "tmNotice-1.0" is used as an abbreviation for
   "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:tmNotice-1.0".  The XML namespace prefix
   "tmNotice" is used, but implementations MUST NOT depend on it and
   instead employ a proper namespace-aware XML parser and serializer to
   interpret and output the XML documents.

3.  Glossary

   In the following section, the most common terms are briefly
   explained:

   o  Backend Registry Operator: Entity that manages (a part of) the
      technical infrastructure for a Registry Operator.  The Registry
      Operator may also be the Backend Registry Operator.

   o  CA: Certificate Authority, see [RFC5280].

   o  CNIS, Claims Notice Information Service: This service provides
      Trademark Claims Notices (TCN) to Registrars.

   o  CRC32, Cyclic Redundancy Check: algorithm used in the ISO 3309
      standard and in section 8.1.1.6.2 of ITU-T recommendation V.42.

   o  CRL: Certificate Revocation List, see [RFC5280].

   o  CSV: Comma-Separated Values, see [RFC4180]

   o  Date and time, datetime: Date and time are specified following the
      standard "Date and Time on the Internet specification", see
      [RFC3339].

   o  DN, Domain Name, domain name: see definition of Domain name in
      [RFC7719].

   o  DNROID, DN Repository Object IDentifier: an identifier assigned by
      the Registry to each DN object that unequivocally identifies said
      DN object.  For example, if a new DN object is created for a name
      that existed in the past, the DN objects will have different
      DNROIDs.

   o  DNL, Domain Name Label, the DNL is an A-label or NR-LDH label (see
      [RFC5890]).

   o  DNL List: A list of DNLs that are covered by a PRM.

   o  DNS: Domain Name System, see [RFC7719].

   o  Effective allocation: A DN is considered effectively allocated
      when the DN object for the DN has been created in the SRS of the
      Registry and has been assigned to the effective user.  A DN object
      in status "pendingCreate" or any other status that precedes the
      first time a DN is assigned to an end-user is not considered an
      effective allocation.  A DN object created internally by the
      Registry for subsequent delegation to another Registrant is not
      considered an effective allocation.

   o  EPP: The Extensible Provisioning Protocol, see definition of EPP
      in [RFC7719].

   o  FQDN: Fully-Qualified Domain Name, see definition of FQDN in
      [RFC7719].

   o  HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol, see [RFC7230] and [RFC7231].

   o  HTTPS: HTTP over TLS (Transport Layer Security), [RFC2818].

   o  IDN: Internationalized Domain Name, see definition of IDN in
      [RFC7719].

   o  Lookup Key: A random string of up to 51 chars from the set [a-zA-
      Z0-9/] to be used as the lookup key by Registrars to obtain the

      TCN using the CNIS.  Lookup Keys are unique and are related to one
      DNL only.

   o  LORDN, List of Registered Domain Names: This is the list of
      effectively allocated DNs matching a DNL of a PRM.  Registries
      will upload this list to the TMDB (during the NORDN process).

   o  Matching Rules: Some trademarks entitled to inclusion in the TMDB
      include characters that are impermissible in the domain name
      system (DNS) as a DNL.  The TMV changes ( using the ICANN TMCH
      Matching Rules [MatchingRules]) certain DNS-impermissible
      characters in a trademark into DNS-permissible equivalent
      characters

   o  NORDN, Notification of Registered Domain Names: The process by
      which Registries upload their recent LORDN to the TMDB.

   o  PGP: Pretty Good Privacy, see [RFC4880]

   o  PKI: Public Key Infrastructure, see [RFC5280].

   o  PRM, Pre-registered mark: Mark that has been pre-registered with
      the ICANN TMCH.

   o  QLP Period, Qualified Launch Program Period: During this optional
      period, a special process applies to DNs matching the Sunrise List
      (SURL) and/or the DNL List, to ensure that TMHs are informed of a
      DN matching their PRM.

   o  Registrant: see definition of Registrant in [RFC7719].

   o  Registrar, Domain Name Registrar: see definition of Registrar in
      [RFC7719].

   o  Registry, Domain Name Registry, Registry Operator: see definition
      of Registry in [RFC7719].  A Registry Operator is the contracting
      party with ICANN for the TLD.

   o  SMD, Signed Mark Data: A cryptographically signed token issued by
      the TMV to the TMH to be used in the Sunrise Period to apply for a
      DN that matches a DNL of a PRM; see also [RFC7848].  An SMD
      generated by an ICANN-approved trademark validator (TMV) contains
      both the signed token and the TMV's PKIX certificate.

   o  SMD File: A file containing the SMD (see above) and some human
      readable data.  The latter is usually ignored in the processing of
      the SMD File.  See also Section 6.4.

Internet-Draft                 ICANN-TMCH                   October 2016


   o  SMD Revocation List: The SMD Revocation List is used by Registries
      (and optionally by Registrars) during the Sunrise Period to ensure
      that an SMD is still valid (i.e. not revoked).  The SMD Revocation
      List has a similar function as CRLs used in PKI.

   o  SRS: Shared Registration System, see also
      [ICANN-GTLD-AGB-20120604].

   o  SURL, Sunrise List: The list of DNLs that are covered by a PRM and
      eligible for Sunrise.

   o  Sunrise Period: During this period DNs matching a DNL of a PRM can
      be exclusively obtained by the respective TMHs.  For DNs matching
      a PRM, a special process applies to ensure that TMHs are informed
      on the effective allocation of a DN matching their PRM.

   o  TLD: Top-Level Domain Name, see definition of TLD in [RFC7719].

   o  ICANN TMCH: a central repository for information to be
      authenticated, stored, and disseminated, pertaining to the rights
      of TMHs.  The ICANN TMCH is split into two functions TMV and TMDB
      (see below).  There could be several entities performing the TMV
      function, but only one entity performing the TMDB function.

   o  ICANN TMCH-CA: The Certificate Authority (CA) for the ICANN TMCH.
      This CA is operated by ICANN.  The public key for this CA is the
      trust anchor used to validate the identity of each TMV.

   o  TMDB, Trademark Clearinghouse Database: Serves as a database of
      the ICANN TMCH to provide information to the gTLD Registries and
      Registrars to support Sunrise or Trademark Claims services.  There
      is only one TMDB in the ICANN TMCH that concentrates the
      information about the "verified" Trademark records from the TMVs.

   o  TMH, Trademark Holder: The person or organization owning rights on
      a mark.

   o  TMV, Trademark Validator, Trademark validation organization: An
      entity authorized by ICANN to authenticate and validate
      registrations in the TMDB ensuring the marks qualify as registered
      or are court-validated marks or marks that are protected by
      statute or treaty.  This entity would also be asked to ensure that
      proof of use of marks is provided, which can be demonstrated by
      furnishing a signed declaration and one specimen of current use.

   o  Trademark, mark: Marks are used to claim exclusive properties of
      products or services.  A mark is typically a name, word, phrase,

      logo, symbol, design, image, or a combination of these elements.
      For the scope of this document only textual marks are relevant.

   o  Trademark Claims, Claims: Provides information to enhance the
      understanding of the Trademark rights being claimed by the TMH.

   o  TCN, Trademark Claims Notice, Claims Notice, Trademark Notice: A
      Trademark Claims Notice consist of one or more Trademark Claims
      and are provided to prospective Registrants of DNs.

   o  TCNID, Trademark Claims Notice Identifier: An element of the
      Trademark Claims Notice (see above), identifying said TCN.  The
      Trademark Claims Notice Identifier is specified in the element
      <tmNotice:id>.

   o  Trademark Claims Period: During this period, a special process
      applies to DNs matching the DNL List, to ensure that TMHs are
      informed of a DN matching their PRM.  For DNs matching the DNL
      List, Registrars show a TCN to prospective Registrants that has to
      be acknowledged before effective allocation of the DN.

   o  UTC: Coordinated Universal Time, as maintained by the Bureau
      International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM); see also [RFC3339].

4.3.7.  yd

   During the Sunrise Period the Registry notifies the TMDB via the yd
   interface of all DNs effectively allocated.

   During the Trademark Claims Period, the Registry notifies the TMDB
   via the yd interface of all DNs effectively allocated that matched an
   entry in the Registry previously downloaded DNL List during the
   creation of the DN.

   The TMV notifies the TMH via the vh interface after a DN has been
   effectively allocated that matches a PRM of this TMH.

   The specifics of the vh interface are beyond the scope of this
   document.

4.3.10.  vs

   The TMV requests to add a revoked SMD to the SMD Revocation List at
   the TMDB.

   The specifics of the vs interface are beyond the scope of this
   document.

   Not relevant during the Trademark Claims Period.

5.2.2.  Sunrise Domain Name registration by Registries

   Registries MUST perform a minimum set of checks for verifying each DN
   registration during the Sunrise Period upon reception of a
   registration request over the ry interface (Section 4.3.5).  If any
   of these checks fails the Registry MUST abort the registration.  Each
   of these checks MUST be performed before the DN is effectively
   allocated.

   In case of asynchronous registrations (e.g. auctions), the minimum
   set of checks MAY be performed when creating the intermediate object
   (e.g. a DN application) used for DN registration.  If the minimum set
   of checks is performed when creating the intermediate object (e.g. a
   DN application) a Registry MAY effective allocate the DN without
   performing the minimum set of checks again.

   Performing the minimum set of checks Registries MUST verify that:

   1.  An SMD has been received from the Registrar along with the DN
       registration.

   2.  The certificate of the TMV has been correctly signed by the ICANN
       TMCH-CA.  (The certificate of the TMV is contained within the
       SMD.)

   3.  The datetime when the validation is done is within the validity
       period of the TMV certificate.

   4.  The certificate of the TMV is not listed in the TMV CRL file
       specified in the CRL distribution point of the TMV certificate.

   5.  The signature of the SMD (signed with the TMV certificate) is
       valid.

   6.  The datetime when the validation is done is within the validity
       period of the SMD based on <smd:notBefore> and <smd:notAfter>
       elements.

   7.  The SMD has not been revoked, i.e., is not contained in the SMD
       Revocation List.

   8.  The leftmost DNL of the DN being effectively allocated matches
       one of the labels (<mark:label>) elements in the SMD.  For
       example, if the DN "xn--mgbachtv.xn--mgbh0fb" is being
       effectively allocated, the leftmost DNL would be "xn--mgbachtv".

   These procedure apply to all DN effective allocations at the second
   level as well as to all other levels subordinate to the TLD that the
   Registry accepts registrations for.

5.2.3.  TMDB Sunrise Services for Registries

5.2.3.1.  SMD Revocation List

   A new SMD Revocation List MUST be published by the TMDB twice a day,
   by 00:00:00 and 12:00:00 UTC.

   Registries MUST refresh the latest version of the SMD Revocation List
   at least once every 24 hours.

   Note: the SMD Revocation List will be the same regardless of the TLD.
   If a Backend Registry Operator manages the infrastructure of several
   TLDs, the Backend Registry Operator could refresh the SMD Revocation
   List once every 24 hours, the SMD Revocation List could be used for
   all the TLDs managed by the Backend Registry Operator.

   Operationally, the TMV CRL file and CRL distribution point is the
   same for all TMVs and (at publication of this document) located at <
   http://crl.icann.org/tmch.crl >.

   Note: the TMV CRL file will be the same regardless of the TLD.  If a
   Backend Registry Operator manages the infrastructure of several TLDs,
   the Backend Registry Operator could refresh the TMV CRL file once
   every 24 hours, the TMV CRL file could be used for all the TLDs
   managed by the Backend Registry Operator.

5.2.3.3.  Notice of Registered Domain Names (NORN)

   The Registry MUST send a LORDN file containing DNs effectively
   allocated to the TMDB (over the yd interface, Section 4.3.7).

   The effective allocation of a DN MUST be reported by the Registry to
   the TMDB within 26 hours of the effective allocation of such DN.

   The Registry MUST create and upload a LORDN file in case there are
   effective allocations in the SRS, that have not been successfully
   reported to the TMDB in a previous LORDN file.

   Based on the timers used by TMVs and the TMDB, the RECOMMENDED
   maximum frequency to upload LORDN files from the Registries to the
   TMDB is every 3 hours.

Internet-Draft                 ICANN-TMCH                   October 2016


   It is RECOMMENDED that Registries try to upload at least two LORDN
   files per day to the TMDB with enough time in between, in order to
   have time to fix problems reported in the LORDN file.

   The Registry SHOULD upload a LORDN file only when the previous LORDN
   file has been processed by the TMDB and the related LORDN Log file
   has been downloaded and processed by the Registry.

   The Registry MUST upload LORDN files for DNs effectively allocated
   during the Sunrise or Trademark Claims Period (same applies to DNs
   effectively allocated using applications created during the Sunrise
   or Trademark Claims Period in case of using asynchronous
   registrations).

   The yd interface (Section 4.3.7) MUST support at least one (1) and
   MAY support up to ten (10) concurrent connections from each IP
   address registered by a Registry Operator to access the service.

   The TMDB MUST process each uploaded LORDN file and make the related
   log file available for Registry download within 30 minutes of the
   finalization of the upload.

   Note: the figure depicted above represents a synchronous DN
   registration workflow (usually called first come first served).

5.3.2.  Trademark Claims Domain Name registration by Registries

   During the Trademark Claims Period, Registries perform two main
   functions:

   o  Registries MUST provide Registrars (over the ry interface,
      Section 4.3.5) the Lookup Key used to retrieve the TCNs for DNs
      that match the DNL List.

   o  Registries MUST provide the Lookup Key only when queried about a
      specific DN.

   o  For each DN matching a DNL of a PRM, Registries MUST perform a
      minimum set of checks for verifying DN registrations during the
      Trademark Claims Period upon reception of a registration request
      over the ry interface (Section 4.3.5).  If any of these checks
      fails the Registry MUST abort the registration.  Each of these
      checks MUST be performed before the DN is effectively allocated.

   o  In case of asynchronous registrations (e.g. auctions), the minimum
      set of checks MAY be performed when creating the intermediate
      object (e.g. a DN application) used for DN effective allocation.
      If the minimum set of checks is performed when creating the
      intermediate object (e.g. a DN application) a Registry MAY
      effective allocate the DN without performing the minimum set of
      checks again.

   o  Performing the minimum set of checks Registries MUST verify that:

      1.  The TCNID (<tmNotice:id>), expiration datetime
          (<tmNotice:notAfter>) and acceptance datetime of the TCN, have
          been received from the Registrar along with the DN
          registration.

             If the three elements mentioned above are not provided by
             the Registrar for a DN matching a DNL of a PRM, but the DNL
             was inserted (or re-inserted) for the first time into DNL
             List less than 24 hours ago, the registration MAY continue
             without this data and the tests listed below are not
             required to be performed.

      2.  The TCN has not expired (according to the expiration datetime
          sent by the Registrar).

Internet-Draft                 ICANN-TMCH                   October 2016


      3.  The acceptance datetime is no more than 48 hours in the past,
          or a different value defined by ICANN policy.

      4.  Using the leftmost DNL of the DN being effectively allocated,
          the expiration datetime provided by the Registrar, and the
          TMDB Notice Identifier extracted from the TCNID provided by
          the Registrar compute the TCN Checksum.  Verify that the
          computed TCN Checksum match the TCN Checksum present in the
          TCNID.  For example, if the DN "xn--mgbachtv.xn--mgbh0fb" is
          being effectively allocated, the leftmost DNL would be "xn--
          mgbachtv".

   These procedures apply to all DN registrations at the second level as
   well as to all other levels subordinate to the TLD that the Registry
   accepts registrations for.

5.3.3.  TMBD Trademark Claims Services for Registries

5.3.3.1.  Domain Name Label (DNL) List

   A new DNL List MUST be published by the TMDB twice a day, by 00:00:00
   and 12:00:00 UTC.

   Registries MUST refresh the latest version of the DNL List at least
   once every 24 hours.

   Note: the DNL List will be the same regardless of the TLD.  If a
   Backend Registry Operator manages the infrastructure of several TLDs,
   the Backend Registry Operator could refresh the DNL List once every
   24 hours, the DNL List could be used for all the TLDs managed by the
   Backend Registry Operator.

5.3.3.2.  Notice of Registered Domain Names (NORN)

   The NORDN process during the Trademark Claims Period is almost the
   same as during Sunrise Period as defined in Section 5.2.3.3 with the
   difference that only registrations subject to a Trademark Claim
   (i.e., at registration time the name appeared in the current DNL List
   downloaded by the Registry Operator) are included in the LORDN.

5.3.4.  Trademark Claims Domain Name registration by Registrars

   For each DN matching a DNL of a PRM, Registrars MUST perform the
   following steps:

   1.  Use the Lookup Key received from the Registry to obtain the TCN
       from the TMDB using the dr interface (Section 4.3.6) Registrars
       MUST only query for the Lookup Key of a DN that is available for
       registration.

   2.  Present the TCN to the Registrant as described in Exhibit A,
       [RPM-Requirements].

   3.  Ask Registrant for acknowledgement, i.e. the Registrant MUST
       consent with the TCN, before any further processing.  (The
       transmission of a TCNID to the Registry over the ry interface,
       Section 4.3.5 implies that the Registrant has expressed his/her
       consent with the TCN.)

   4.  Perform the minimum set of checks for verifying DN registrations.
       If any of these checks fails the Registrar MUST abort the DN
       registration.  Each of these checks MUST be performed before the
       registration is sent to the Registry.  Performing the minimum set
       of checks Registrars MUST verify that:

       1.  The datetime when the validation is done is within the TCN
           validity based on the <tmNotice:notBefore> and
           <tmNotice:notAfter> elements.

       2.  The leftmost DNL of the DN being effectively allocated
           matches the label (<tmNotice:label>) element in the TCN.  For
           example, if the DN "xn--mgbachtv.xn--mgbh0fb" is being
           effectively allocated, the leftmost DNL would be "xn--
           mgbachtv".

Internet-Draft                 ICANN-TMCH                   October 2016


       3.  The Registrant has acknowledged (expressed his/her consent
           with) the TCN.

   5.  Record the date and time when the registrant acknowledged the
       TCN.

   6.  Send the registration to the Registry (ry interface,
       Section 4.3.5) and include the following information:

       *  TCNID (<tmNotice:id>)

       *  Expiration date of the TCN (<tmNotice:notAfter>)

       *  Acceptance datetime of the TCN.

   TCNs are generated twice a day.  The expiration date
   (<tmNotice:notAfter>) of each TCN MUST be set to 48 hours (or a
   different value if defined by ICANN policy) in the future by the
   TMDB, allowing the implementation of a cache by Registrars and enough
   time for acknowledging the TCN.  Registrars SHOULD implement a cache
   of TCNs to minimize the number of queries sent to the TMDB.  A cached
   TCN MUST be removed from the cache after the expiration date of the
   TCN as defined by <tmNotice:notAfter>.  The TMDB MAY implement rate-
   limiting as one of the protection mechanisms to mitigate the risk of
   performance degradation.

5.3.5.  TMBD Trademark Claims Services for Registrars

5.3.5.1.  Claims Notice Information Service (CNIS)

   The TCNs are provided by the TMDB online and are fetched by the
   Registrar via the dr interface (Section 4.3.6).

   To get access to the TCNs, the Registrar needs the credentials
   provided by the TMDB (Section 5.1.2.1) and the Lookup Key received
   from the Registry via the ry interface (Section 4.3.5).  The dr
   interface (Section 4.3.6) uses HTTPS with Basic access
   authentication.

   The dr interface (Section 4.3.6) MAY support up to ten (10)
   concurrent connections from each Registrar.

   The URL of the dr interface (Section 4.3.6) is:

      < https://<tmdb-domain-name>/cnis/<lookupkey>.xml >

Internet-Draft                 ICANN-TMCH                   October 2016


   Note that the "lookupkey" may contain SLASH characters ("/").  The
   SLASH character is part of the URL path and MUST NOT be escaped when
   requesting the TCN.

   The TLS certificate (HTTPS) used on the dr interface (Section 4.3.6)
   MUST be signed by a well-know public CA.  Registrars MUST perform the
   Certification Path Validation described in Section 6 of [RFC5280].
   Registrars will be authenticated in the dr interface using HTTP Basic
   access authentication.  The dr (Section 4.3.6) interface MUST support
   HTTPS keep-alive and MUST maintain the connection for up to 30
   minutes.

5.4.  Qualified Launch Program (QLP) Period

5.4.1.  Domain Registration

   During the OPTIONAL (see [QLP-Addendum]) Qualified Launch Program
   (QLP) Period effective allocations of DNs to third parties could
   require that Registries and Registrars provide Sunrise and/or
   Trademark Claims services.  If required, Registries and Registrars
   MUST provide Sunrise and/or Trademark Claims services as described in
   Section 5.2 and Section 5.3.

   The effective allocation scenarios are:

   o  If the leftmost DNL of the DN being effectively allocated (QLP
      Name in this section) matches a DNL in the SURL, and an SMD is
      provided, then Registries MUST provide Sunrise Services (see
      Section 5.2) and the DN MUST be reported in a Sunrise LORDN file
      during the QLP Period.  For example, if the DN "xn--mgbachtv.xn--
      mgbh0fb" is being effectively allocated, the leftmost DNL would be
      "xn--mgbachtv".

   o  If the QLP Name matches a DNL in the SURL but does not match a DNL
      in the DNL List, and an SMD is NOT provided (see section 2.2 of
      [QLP-Addendum]), then the DN MUST be reported in a Sunrise LORDN
      file using the special SMD-id "99999-99999" during the QLP Period.

   o  If the QLP Name matches a DNL in the SURL and also matches a DNL
      in the DNL List, and an SMD is NOT provided (see section 2.2 of
      [QLP-Addendum]), then Registries MUST provide Trademark Claims
      services (see Section 5.3) and the DN MUST be reported in a
      Trademark Claims LORDN file during the QLP Period.

   o  If the QLP Name matches a DNL in the DNL List but does not match a
      DNL in the SURL, then Registries MUST provide Trademark Claims
      services (see Section 5.2) and the DN MUST be reported in a
      Trademark Claims LORDN file during the QLP Period.

6.  Data Format Descriptions

6.1.  Domain Name Label (DNL) List

   This section defines the format of the list containing every Domain
   Name Label (DNL) that matches a Pre-Registered Mark (PRM).  The list
   is maintained by the TMDB and downloaded by Registries in regular
   intervals (see Section 5.3.3.1).  The Registries use the DNL List

   during the Trademark Claims Period to check whether a requested DN
   matches a DNL of a PRM.

   The DNL List contains all the DNLs covered by a PRM present in the
   TMDB at the datetime it is generated.

   The DNL List is contained in a CSV formatted file that has the
   following structure:

   o  first line: <version>,<DNL List creation datetime>

         Where:

         +  <version>, version of the file, this field MUST be 1.

         +  <DNL List creation datetime>, date and time in UTC that the
            DNL List was created.

   o  second line: a header line as specified in [RFC4180]

         With the header names as follows:

         DNL,lookup-key,insertion-datetime

   o  One or more lines with: <DNL>,<lookup key>,<DNL insertion
      datetime>

         Where:

         +  <DNL>, a Domain Name Label covered by a PRM.

         +  <lookup key>, lookup key that the Registry MUST provide to
            the Registrar.  The lookup key has the following format:
            <YYYY><MM><DD><vv>/<X>/<X>/<X>/<Random bits><Sequential
            number>, where:

            -  YYYY: year that the TCN was generated.

            -  MM: zero-padded month that the TCN was generated.

            -  DD: zero-padded day that the TCN was generated.

            -  vv: version of the TCN, possible values are 00 and 01.

            -  X: one hexadecimal digit [0-9A-F].  This is the first,
               second and third hexadecimal digit of encoding the
               <Random bits> in base16 as specified in [RFC4648].

6.2.  SMD Revocation List

   This section defines the format of the list of SMDs that have been
   revoked.  The list is maintained by the TMDB and downloaded by
   Registries (and optionally by Registrars) in regular intervals (see
   Section 5.2.3.1).  The SMD Revocation List is used during the Sunrise
   Period to validate SMDs received.  The SMD Revocation List has a
   similar function as CRLs used in PKI [RFC5280].

   The SMD Revocation List contains all the revoked SMDs present in the
   TMDB at the datetime it is generated.

         Where:

         +  <smd-id>, identifier of the SMD that was revoked.

         +  <revoked SMD datetime>, revocation datetime in UTC of the
            SMD.  The possible two values of time for inserting an SMD
            to the SMD Revocation List are 00:00:00 and 12:00:00 UTC.

   To provide integrity protection, the SMD Revocation List is PGP

6.3.  List of Registered Domain Names (LORDN) file

   This section defines the format of the List of Registered Domain
   Names (LORDN), which is maintained by each Registry and uploaded at
   least daily to the TMDB.  Every time a DN matching a DNL of a PRM
   said DN is added to the LORDN along with further information related
   to its registration.

   The URIs of the yd interface (Section 4.3.7) used to upload the LORDN
   file is:

   o  The interface provides a HTTP/202 status code if the interface was
      able to receive the LORDN file and the syntax of the LORDN file is
      correct.

         The interface provides the LORDN Transaction Identifier in the
         HTTP Entity-body that would be used by the Registry to download
         the LORDN Log file.  The LORDN Transaction Identifier is a
         natural number zero-padded in the range 0000000000000000001 to
         9223372036854775807.

         The TMDB uses the <LORDN creation datetime> element of the
         LORDN file as a unique client-side identifier.  If a LORDN file
         with the same <LORDN creation datetime> of a previously sent
         LORDN file is received by the TMDB, the LORDN Transaction
         Identifier of the previously sent LORDN file MUST be provided
         to the Registry.  The TMDB MUST ignore the DN Lines present in
         the LORDN file if a LORDN file with the same <LORDN creation
         datetime> was previously sent.

         The HTTP Location header field contains the URI where the LORDN
         Log file could be retrieved later, for example:

            202 Accepted

            Location: https://<tmdb-domain-
            name>/LORDN/example/sunrise/0000000000000000001/result

   o  The interface provides a HTTP/400 if the request is incorrect or
      the syntax of the LORDN file is incorrect.  The TMDB MUST return a
      human readable message in the HTTP Entity-body regarding the
      incorrect syntax of the LORDN file.

   o  The interface provides a HTTP/401 status code if the credentials
      provided does not authorize the Registry Operator to upload a
      LORDN file.

   o  The TMDB MUST return a HTTP/404 status code when trying to upload
      a LORDN file using the https://<tmdb-domain-
      name>/LORDN/<TLD>/sunrise/qlp or https://<tmdb-domain-
      name>/LORDN/<TLD>/claims/qlp interface outside of a QLP Period
      plus 26 hours.

   o  The interface provides a HTTP/500 status code if the system is
      experiencing a general failure.

   For example, to upload the Sunrise LORDN file for TLD "example", the
   URI would be:

6.3.1.  LORDN Log file

   After reception of the LORDN file, the TMDB verifies its content for
   syntactical and semantical correctness.  The output of the LORDN file
   verification is retrieved using the yd interface (Section 4.3.7).

   The URI of the yd interface (Section 4.3.7) used to retrieve the
   LORDN Log file is:

   o  Sunrise LORDN Log file:

         < https://<tmdb-domain-name>/LORDN/<TLD>/sunrise/<lordn-
         transaction-identifier>/result >

   o  Trademark Claims LORDN Log file:

         < https://<tmdb-domain-name>/LORDN/<TLD>/claims/<lordn-
         transaction-identifier>/result >

   A Registry Operator MUST NOT send more than one request per minute
   per TLD to download a LORDN Log file.

   The yd interface (Section 4.3.7) returns the following HTTP status
   codes after a HTTP GET request method is received:

   o  The interface provides a HTTP/200 status code if the interface was
      able to provide the LORDN Log file.  The LORDN Log file is
      contained in the HTTP Entity-body.

   o  The interface provides a HTTP/204 status code if the LORDN
      Transaction Identifier is correct, but the server has not
      finalized processing the LORDN file.

   o  The interface provides a HTTP/400 status code if the request is
      incorrect.

   o  The interface provides a HTTP/401 status code if the credentials
      provided does not authorize the Registry Operator to download the
      LORDN Log file.

   o  The interface provides a HTTP/404 status code if the LORDN
      Transaction Identifier is incorrect.

   o  The interface provides a HTTP/500 status code if the system is
      experiencing a general failure.

            creation for the LORDN file that this log file is referring
            to.

         +  <LORDN Log Identifier>, unique identifier of the LORDN Log
            provided by the TMDB.  This identifier could be used by the
            Registry Operator to unequivocally identify the LORDN Log.
            The identified will be a string of a maximum LENGTH of 60
            characters from the Base 64 alphabet.

         +  <Status flag>, whether the LORDN file has been accepted for
            processing by the TMDB.  Possible values are "accepted" or
            "rejected".

         +  <Warning flag>, whether the LORDN Log has any warning result
            codes.  Possible values are "no-warnings" or "warnings-
            present".

         +  <Number of DN Lines>, number of DNs effective allocations
            processed in the LORDN file.

         A Registry Operator is NOT REQUIRED to process a LORDN Log with
         a <Status flag>="accepted" and <Warning flag>="no-warnings".

6.3.1.1.  LORDN Log Result Codes

   In Figure 15 the classes of result codes (rc) are listed.  Those
   classes in square brackets are not used at this time, but may come
   into use at some later stage.  The first two digits of a result code
   denote the result code class, which defines the outcome at the TMDB:

   o  ok: Success, DN Line accepted by the TMDB.

   o  warn: a warning is issued, DN Line accepted by the TMDB.

   o  err: an error is issued, LORDN file rejected by the TMDB.

   In case that after processing a DN Line, the error result code is
   45xx or 46xx for that DN Line, the LORDN file MUST be rejected by the
   TMDB.  If the LORDN file is rejected, DN Lines that are syntactically
   valid will be reported with a 2001 result code.  A 2001 result code
   means that the DN Line is syntactically valid, however the DN Line
   was not processed because the LORDN file was rejected.  All DNs
   reported in a rejected LORDN file MUST be reported again by the
   Registry because none of the DN Lines present in the LORDN file have
   been processed by the TMDB.

   Two encapsulation boundaries are defined for delimiting the
   encapsulated base64 encoded SMD: i.e. "-----BEGIN ENCODED SMD-----"
   and "-----END ENCODED SMD-----".  Only data inside the encapsulation
   boundaries MUST be used by Registries and Registrars for validation
   purposes, i.e. any data outside these boundaries as well as the
   boundaries themselves MUST be ignored for validation purposes.

   The structure of the SMD File is as follows, all the elements are
   REQUIRED, and MUST appear in the specified order.

   1.  Marks: <marks>

   2.  smdID: <SMD-ID>

   3.  U-labels: <comma separated list of U-label or NR-LDH labels (see
       [RFC5890])>

   4.  notBefore: <begin validity>

   5.  notAfter: <end validity>

   6.  -----BEGIN ENCODED SMD-----

   7.  <encoded SMD (see [RFC7848])>

   8.  -----END ENCODED SMD-----

6.5.  Trademark Claims Notice (TCN)

   The TMDB MUST provide the TCN to Registrars in XML format as
   specified below.

   An enclosing element <tmNotice:notice> that describes the Trademark
   Notice to a given label.

   The child elements of the <tmNotice:notice> element include:

   o  A <tmNotice:id> element that contains the unique identifier of the
      Trademark Notice.  This element contains the the TCNID.

         The TCNID is a string concatenation of a TCN Checksum and the
         TMDB Notice Identifier.  The first 8 characters of the TCNID is
         a TCN Checksum.  The rest is the TMDB Notice Identifier, which
         is a zero-padded natural number in the range of
         0000000000000000001 to 9223372036854775807.

         Example of a TCNID:

            370d0b7c9223372036854775807.

         Where:

         +  TCN Checksum=370d0b7c

         +  TMDB Notice Identifier=9223372036854775807

         The TCN Checksum is a 8 characters long Base16 encoded output
         of computing the CRC32 of the string concatenation of: label +
         unix_timestamp(<tmNotice:notAfter>) + TMDB Notice Identifier

         TMDB MUST use the Unix time conversion of the
         <tmNotice:notAfter> in UTC to calculate the TCN Checksum.  Unix
         time is defined as the number of seconds that have elapsed
         since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z not counting leap seconds.  For
         example, the conversion to Unix time of 2010-08-16T09:00:00.0Z
         is shown:

            unix_time(2010-08-16T09:00:00.0Z)=1281949200

         The TMDB uses the <tmNotice:label> and <tmNotice:notAfter>
         elements from the TCN along with the TMDB Notice Identifier to
         compute the TCN Checksum.

         A Registry MUST use the leftmost DNL of the DN being
         effectively allocated, the expiration datetime of the TCN
         (provided by the Registrar) and the TMDB Notice Identifier
         extracted from the TCNID (provided by the Registrar) to compute
         the TCN Checksum.  For example, if the DN "xn--mgbachtv.xn--
         mgbh0fb" is being effectively allocated, the leftmost DNL would
         be "xn--mgbachtv".

         Example of computation of the TCN Checksum:

            CRC32(example-one12819492009223372036854775807)=370d0b7c

   o  A <tmNotice:notBefore> element that contains the start of the
      validity date and time of the TCN.

   o  A <tmNotice:notAfter> element that contains the expiration date
      and time of the TCN.

   o  A <tmNotice:label> element that contains the DNL covered by a PRM.

   o  One or more <tmNotice:claim> elements that contain the Trademark
      Claim.  The <tmNotice:claim> element contains the following child
      elements:

      *  A <tmNotice:markName> element that contains the mark text
         string.

      *  One or more <tmNotice:holder> elements that contains the
         information of the holder of the mark.  An "entitlement"
         attribute is used to identify the entitlement of the holder,

6.6.  Sunrise List (SURL)

   This section defines the format of the list containing every Domain
   Name Label (DNL) that matches a PRM eligible for Sunrise.  The list
   is maintained by the TMDB and downloaded by Registries in regular
   intervals (see Section 5.4.2.1).  The Registries use the Sunrise List
   during the Qualified Launch Program Period to check whether a
   requested DN matches a DNL of a PRM eligible for Sunrise.

   The Sunrise List contains all the DNLs covered by a PRM eligible for
   Sunrise present in the TMDB at the datetime it is generated.

   The Sunrise List is contained in a CSV formatted file that has the
   following structure:

   o  first line: <version>,<Sunrise List creation datetime>

         Where:

         +  <version>, version of the file, this field MUST be 1.

         +  <Sunrise List creation datetime>, date and time in UTC that
            the Sunrise List was created.

   o  second line: a header line as specified in [RFC4180]

         With the header names as follows:

         DNL,insertion-datetime

   o  One or more lines with: <DNL>,<DNL insertion datetime>

         Where:

         +  <DNL>, a Domain Name Label covered by a PRM eligible for
            Sunrise.

         +  <DNL insertion datetime>, datetime in UTC that the DNL was
            first inserted into the Sunrise List.  The possible two
            values of time for inserting a DNL to the Sunrise List are
            00:00:00 and 12:00:00 UTC.

8.  Acknowledgements

   This specification is a collaborative effort from several
   participants in the ICANN community.  Bernie Hoeneisen participated
   as co-author until version 02 providing invaluable support for this
   document.  This specification is based on a model spearheaded by:
   Chris Wright, Jeff Neuman, Jeff Eckhaus and Will Shorter.  The author
   would also like to thank the thoughtful feedbak provided by many in
   the tmch-tech mailing list, but particularly the extensive help
   provided by James Gould, James Mitchell and Francisco Arias.  This
   document includes feedback received from the following individuals:
   Paul Hoffman.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document uses URNs to describe XML namespaces and XML schemas
   conforming to a registry mechanism described in [RFC3688].  One URI
   assignment have been registered by the IANA.

   Registration request for the Trademark Claims Notice namespace:

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:tmNotice-1.0

      Registrant Contact: See the "Author's Address" section of this
      document.

      XML: None.  Namespace URIs do not represent an XML specification.

   Registration request for the Trademark Claims Notice XML schema:

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:tmNotice-1.0

      Registrant Contact: See the "Author's Address" section of this
      document.

Internet-Draft                 ICANN-TMCH                   October 2016


      XML: See Section 7.1 of this document.

10.  Security Considerations

   This specification uses HTTP Basic Authentication to provide a simple
   application-layer authentication service.  HTTPS is used in all
   interfaces in order to protect against most common attacks.  In
   addition, the client identifier is tied to a set of IP addresses that
   are allowed to connect to the interfaces described in this document,
   providing an extra security measure.

   The TMDB MUST provide credentials to the appropriate Registries and
   Registrars.

   The TMDB MUST require the use of strong passwords by Registries and
   Registrars.

   The TMDB, Registries and Registrars MUST use the best practices
   described in RFC 7525 or its successors.
