1.  Introduction

   Identity resolution system is an important network infrastructure for
   the Industrial Internet.  It provides codes, registration and
   resolution services for industrial equipment, machines, materials,
   parts and products to achieve interoperability, secure sharing and
   intelligent association of heterogeneous information, which is an
   important cornerstone for the rapid development of the Industrial
   Internet.  Typical global identity resolution systems include the
   Handle system [RFC3650] [RFC3651], the Object Identifier (OID)
   resolution system [OID], etc.  In order to ensure the security of
   data transmission involved in the Industrial Internet identity
   resolution system, the security technical requirements are formulated

   The top-level node within a country or region, which is connected to
   the international root node and secondary nodes, provides top-level
   identity resolution services for the whole country.

3.3.  Secondary Node

   The public node providing identity services for specific industries
   or multiple industries is responsible for allocating identity and
   providing identity registration, identity resolution and identity
   data services for industrial enterprises.  And they are divided into
   two types of industry secondary nodes and comprehensive secondary
   nodes.

3.4.  Enterprise Node

   An intra-enterprise identity service node is able to provide identity
   registration, identity resolution service, identity data service,
   etc. for a specific enterprise and connect with secondary nodes.

6.  Security Protection Scope

   The security protection scope of the Industrial Internet identity
   resolution and management service system proposed in this draft
   mainly means that the identity is written into the device and is
   responsible for collecting product information including device
   model, device type, generation batch, generation date, generation
   site, device production information link, device description data
   link, etc., integrate this information into identity data, and then
   publish it to the data exchange system for access by identity
   resolution enterprise nodes.  Among the identity resolution
   enterprise node, the identity resolution secondary node, and the
   identity resolution root node, the process of data synchronization
   between the application scenarios, the collection of data
   transmission technologies used, is used to provide security assurance
   and security support for the Industrial Internet identity data
   transmission.

   The scope of Industrial Internet identity data transmission security
   protection specifically includes the security and the security
   support of the data transmission interface within and between the
   functional domains of the Industrial Internet identity resolution
   system.  Its role is in the whole life cycle of the system (planning
   and design, development and construction, operation and maintenance ,
   abandonment and exit).

7.  Safety Technical Requirements

7.1.  Data Transmission Integrity

   Data transmission should comply with the following common
   requirements:

   1) Support the information integrity check mechanism during
   transmission to realize the transmission integrity protection of
   management data, authentication information, sensitive information,
   important business data and other data (such as: check code, message
   abstract, digital signature, etc.).



Wang, et al.             Expires 18 October 2021                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft      Data Transmission Security of IR          April 2021


   2) It has the functions of communication delay and interrupt
   processing to ensure the integrity of the data.

   3) For important data, use the relevant cryptographic algorithm
   technology of National Cryptography Administration to ensure the
   integrity of data transmission

   4) Take measures to restore or regain data when it detects that the
   integrity has been compromised.

7.2.  Data Transmission Availability

   The timeliness and accuracy of the data shall be guaranteed during
   data transmission.  Specifically:

   1) Timeliness: the feature of identifying historical data received or
   data beyond the time limit.  Specifically, the data comes from the
   system using a unified time allocation/correction mechanism, and the
   data should include time stamps, etc.

   2) Accuracy: When there is an acceptable error in the data, there is
   an overload to ensure the normal acquisition of the data in time.

7.3.  Data Transmission Confidentiality

   When transferring data, it is necessary to ensure the confidentiality
   of the data, including:

   1) For important data, authenticate information and important
   business data such as user passwords, biometrics, private keys,
   symmetric keys, product order information, device unique identity
   (Handle ID), etc., a certain strength encryption algorithm or other
   effective measures should be used to ensure Confidentiality.

   2) Choose appropriate security protocols (such as HTTPS, SSH, IPSec,
   TLS, etc.) to protect the transmitted data.

7.4.  Data Transmission Authentication

   Ensure the legitimacy of the identities of both parties in the data
   transmission, which means, ensure the identity authentication of the
   subject to the object before the interaction, and establish a trusted
   transmission path.

Internet-Draft      Data Transmission Security of IR          April 2021


7.5.  Data Transmission Strategy

   Establish a formal transmission strategy to protect the security of
   all types of information transmitted through communication
   facilities, and meet:

   1) Clarify the type and scope of information that can be transmitted
   in plain text.

   2) For sensitive data, such as user passwords, biometrics, private
   keys, symmetric keys, etc., an encrypted transmission strategy is
   required.

7.6.  Data Transmission Protocol

   The protocol should address the safe transmission of internal and
   external business, and meet:

   Cryptographic algorithms such as data abstract, signature, and
   authentication shall use the cryptographic algorithms and
   combinations of abstract, signature, and authentication required by
   national regulations or national mandatory standards.

7.7.  Maintenance and Update of Transmission Protocol

   The confidentiality protocol for data transmission should be
   regularly maintained and updated so that the procotol should reflect
   the requirements for data transmission security protection and meet:

   1) The transmission security protocol needs to be reviewed every year
   to ensure that the agreement should reflect the requirements for data
   transmission security protection

   2) When new services are launched or existing services are changed,
   the transmission security protocol needs to be audited and updated if
   necessary

7.8.  Log and Audit

   The transmission system shall log and audit the following security
   failure events.  The content of the log shall at least contains date/
   time, event type, event subject, event description, success/failure
   information, and meet the following requirements:

   1) Data transmission establishment success and failure

   2) Transmission device online monitoring abnormalities and alarm
   events
