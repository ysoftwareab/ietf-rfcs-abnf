               BGP RPKI-Based Origin Validation on Export
                    draft-ymbk-sidrops-ov-egress-00

Abstract

   It is useful fpr RPKI-based Origin Validation to classify and mark
   prefixes for all ingress, redistribution, and egress policies.  For
   egress policy, it is important that the classification uses the
   effective origin AS of the processed route, which may specifically be
   altered by the commonly available knobs such as removing private ASs,
   confederation handling, and other modifications of the origin AS.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to
   be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] only when they appear in all
   upper case.  They may also appear in lower or mixed case as English
   words, without normative meaning.

1.  Introduction

   As the origin AS may be modified by outbound policy, policy semantics
   based on RPKI Origin Validation state MUST be able to be applied
   separately on distribution into BGP and on egress.

   When applied to egress policy, the effective origin AS MUST be used
   to determine the Origin Validation state.  The effective origin AS is
   that which will actually be the origin AS in the announcement.  It
   might be affected by removal of private AS(s), confederation, AS
   migration, etc.  If there are any AS_PATH modifications resulting in
   origin AS change, then these MUST be taken into account.

2.  Suggested Reading

   It is assumed that the reader understands BGP, [RFC4271], the RPKI,
   [RFC6480], Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs), [RFC6482], RPKI-based
   Prefix Validation, [RFC6811], and Origin Validation Clarifications,
   [RFC8481].

3.  Egress Processing

   BGP implementations supporting RPKI-based origin validation SHOULD
   provide the same policy configuration primitives for decisions based
   on validation state available for use in ingress, redistribution, and
   egress policies.  When applied to egress policy, validation state
   MUST be determined using the effective origin AS of the route as it
   will (or would) be announced to the peer.  The effective origin AS
   may differ from that of the route in the RIB due to commonly
   available knobs such as: removal of private ASs, AS path
   manipulation, confederation handling, etc.

   Egress policy handling can provide more robust protection for
   outbound eBGP than relying solely on ingress (iBGP, eBGP, connected,
   static, etc.) redistribution being configured and working correctly -
   better support for the robustness principle.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document does not create security considerations beyond those of
   [RFC6811] and [RFC8481].

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA Considerations.
