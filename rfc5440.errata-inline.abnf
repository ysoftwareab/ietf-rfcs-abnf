Error-Type=1: PCEP session establishment failure.

      If a malformed message is received, the receiving PCEP peer MUST
      send a PCErr message with Error-Type=1, Error-value=1.

      If no Open message is received before the expiration of the
      OpenWait timer, the receiving PCEP peer MUST send a PCErr message
      with Error-Type=1, Error-value=2 (see Appendix A for details).

      If one or more PCEP session characteristics are unacceptable by
      the receiving peer and are not negotiable, it MUST send a PCErr
      message with Error-Type=1, Error-value=3.

      If an Open message is received with unacceptable session
      characteristics but these characteristics are negotiable, the
      receiving PCEP peer MUST send a PCErr message with Error-Type-1,
Error-value=4 (see Section 6.2 for details).

Error-Type=2:  the PCE indicates that the path computation request
      cannot be honored because it does not support one or more required
      capability.  The corresponding path computation request MUST be
      cancelled.

Error-Type=3 or Error-Type=4:  if a PCEP message is received that
      carries a PCEP object (with the P flag set) not recognized by the
      PCE or recognized but not supported, then the PCE MUST send a
      PCErr message with a PCEP-ERROR object (Error-Type=3 and 4,
      respectively).  In addition, the PCE MAY include in the PCErr
      message the unknown or not supported object.  The corresponding
      path computation request MUST be cancelled by the PCE without
      further notification.

Error-Type=5:  if a path computation request is received that is not
      compliant with an agreed policy between the PCC and the PCE, the
      PCE MUST send a PCErr message with a PCEP-ERROR object (Error-
Type=5).  The corresponding path computation MUST be cancelled.
Error-Type=6:  if a path computation request is received that does
      not contain a mandatory object, the PCE MUST send a PCErr message
      with a PCEP-ERROR object (Error-Type=6).  If there are multiple
      mandatory objects missing, the PCErr message MUST contain one
      PCEP-ERROR object per missing object.  The corresponding path
      computation MUST be cancelled.

Error-Type=7:  if a PCC sends a synchronized path computation request
      to a PCE and the PCE does not receive all the synchronized path
      computation requests listed within the corresponding SVEC object
      after the expiration of the timer SyncTimer defined in
      Section 7.13.3, the PCE MUST send a PCErr message with a PCEP-
      ERROR object (Error-Type=7).  The corresponding synchronized path
      computation MUST be cancelled.  It is RECOMMENDED for the PCE to
      include the REQ-MISSING TLVs (defined below) that identify the
      missing requests.

      The REQ-MISSING TLV is compliant with the PCEP TLV format defined
      in section 7.1 and is comprised of 2 bytes for the type, 2 bytes
      specifying the TLV length (length of the value portion in bytes),
      followed by a fixed-length value field of 4 bytes.

         Type:   3
         Length: 4 bytes
         Value:  4 bytes that indicate the Request-ID-number that
                 corresponds to the missing request.

Error-Type=8:  if a PCC receives a PCRep message related to an
      unknown path computation request, the PCC MUST send a PCErr
      message with a PCEP-ERROR object (Error-Type=8).  In addition, the
      PCC MUST include in the PCErr message the unknown RP object.

Error-Type=9:  if a PCEP peer detects an attempt from another PCEP
      peer to establish a second PCEP session, it MUST send a PCErr
      message with Error-Type=9, Error-value=1.  The existing PCEP
      session MUST be preserved and all subsequent messages related to
      the tentative establishment of the second PCEP session MUST be
      silently ignored.

Error-Type=10:  if a PCEP peers receives an object with the P flag
      not set although the P flag must be set according to this
      specification, it MUST send a PCErr message with Error-Type=10,
Error-value=1.

Error-value=1: reception of an invalid Open message or
                       a non Open message.
Error-value=2: no Open message received before the expiration
                       of the OpenWait timer
Error-value=3: unacceptable and non-negotiable session
                       characteristics
Error-value=4: unacceptable but negotiable session
                       characteristics
Error-value=5: reception of a second Open message with
                       still unacceptable session characteristics
Error-value=6: reception of a PCErr message proposing
                       unacceptable session characteristics
Error-value=7: No Keepalive or PCErr message received
                       before the expiration of the KeepWait timer

Error-value=3: END-POINTS object missing
Error-value=1: reception of an object with P flag
                        not set although the P flag must be
                        set according to this specification.
