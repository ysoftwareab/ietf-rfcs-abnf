1. Introduction

   This document defines low level monitoring and status MIBs for IPSec
   security associations (SAs). It does not define MIBs that may be used
   for configuring IPSec implementations or for providing low-level
   diagnostic or debugging information. It assumes no specific use of
   IPSec. Further, it does not provide policy information.

   The purpose of the MIBs is to allow system administrators to
   determine operating conditions and perform system operational level
   monitoring of the IPSec portion of their network. Statistics are
   provided as well. Additionally, it may be used as the basis for
   application specific MIBs for specific uses of IPSec SAs.


2. The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

  o  An overall architecture, described in RFC 2271 [2271].

  o  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
     purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
     Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described inRFC
     1155 [1155], RFC 1212 [1212] and RFC 1215 [1215]. The second
     version, called SMIv2, is described in RFC 1902 [1902], RFC 1903
     [1903] and RFC 1904 [1904].




IPSec Working Group                                             [Page 2]


Internet Draft           IPSec Monitoring MIB                  June 1999


  o  Message protocols for transferring management information. The
     first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
     described in RFC 1157 [1157]. A second version of the SNMP message
     protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is
     called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [1901] and RFC 1906
     [1906]. The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3
     and described in RFC 1906 [1906], RFC 2272 [2272] and RFC 2274
     [2274].

  o  Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
     first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
     described in RFC 1157 [1157]. A second set of protocol operations
     and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [1905].

  o  A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2273 [2273] and
     the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2275
     [2275].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter32). Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.


2.1 Object Definitions

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
   defined in the SMI. In particular, each object type is named by an
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name. The object type
   together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a
   specific instantiation of the object. For human convenience, we often
   use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the object
   type.

3. IPSec MIB Objects Architecture

   The IPSec MIB consists of tables for the display of raw IPSec
   security associations (SAs), some entity statistics and traps.

   Configuration about the SAs is provided as are statistics related to
   the SAs themselves.

   The traps may be used by system administrators to help detect mis-
   configurations or possible attacks.


3.1 IPSec Security Association Tables

   Individual IPSec phase 2 SAs are separated by both direction and
   (security) protocol, resulting in the creation of six separate
   tables.

   Separate inbound tables are used for ESP, AH and IPCOMP. All tables
   contain common information, such as the selectors and expiration
   limits, in addition to protocol specific information. Similarly,
   there is a set of outbound tables for each protocol.

   The SAs in the tables may have been statically created, created by
   IKE or by some other mechanism.


3.1.1 IPCOMP Security Associations

   For IPCOMP SAs, the following assumptions are made:

  o  These SAs don't care about policy errors.

  o  These SAs don't care about expiration.

  o  The selectors can be empty (all 0) if IPCOMP is shared across
     multiple protection suites.

  o  There are no send errors; the SA will send uncompressed if it
     can't compress for any reason.


3.2 IPSec MIB Traps

   Traps are provided to let system administrators know about the
   existence of error conditions occurring in the entity. Errors are
   associated with operational errors that may indicate the presence of
   attacks on the system.


IPSec Working Group                                             [Page 4]


Internet Draft           IPSec Monitoring MIB                  June 1999


   Traps are not provided when SAs come up or go down.

   Traps may also be enabled or disabled as required, using configurable
   configuration objects. Note that support for these objects is
   optional, so that system administrators that have concerns about SNMP
   security can choose to implement objects that are write-only.


3.3 IPSec Entity Level Objects

   This part of the MIB carries statistics global to the IPSec device.

   Statistics included are aggregate numbers of and aggregate errors for
   SAs.

5. Security Considerations

   This MIB contains readable objects whose values provide information
   related to IPSec SAs. While some of the information is readily
   available by monitoring the traffic into an entity, other information
   may provide attackers with more information than an administrator may
   desire.

   Some of the specific concerns are related to the display of the
   algorithms and key lengths associated with encryption, and the
   feedback of error counters and traps that enable an attacker to
   quickly determine the effect of his or her attacks.

   Specific examples of this include, but are not limited to:

  o  Replay counts that tell attackers that replay values are being
     checked, and what the current window is.

  o  Specific algorithms and key lengths are displayed, giving
     attackers a better idea of how to attack.

  o  Specific traffic counts, giving attackers more information for
     traffic analysis.

   Of particular concern is the ability to disable the transmission of
   traps. The traps defined in this MIB may appear due to badly
   configured systems and transient error conditions, but they may also
   appear due to attacks. If an attacker can disable these traps, they
   reduce some of the warnings that may be provided to system
   administrators.

   application specific constructs in addition to the IPSec only
