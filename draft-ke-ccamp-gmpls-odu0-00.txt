Internet-Draft     GMPLS Signaling Extensions for ODUO      October 2008


1.  Introduction

   As described in [ITUT-G.709], ODU1 has the lowest rate in ODUk layer.
   It is unreasonable that using ODU1 to carry the 1 GE signal because
   half of the bandwidth is wasted.  Using ODU0 with an approximate bit
   rate of 1.2 Gbit/s to carry the 1GE signal is suitable.

   Notice that OTU0 relative to ODU0 doesn't exist, ODU0 must be
   multiplexed into ODU1.  The process of mapping and multiplexing of
   ODU1 embedded with ODU0 is consistent with [ITUT-G.709].  Technology
   specific details of ODU0 are outside the scope of this document.

   [RFC4328] extends GMPLS to support G.709 Optical Transport Networks
   Control.  To support the application of ODU0, the extensions based on
   [RFC4328] are needed.  The first extension defines a signal Type of
   ODU0 in G.709 Traffic Parameters.  The second extension provides the
   compatible definition of ODUk Label.


2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119.


3.  Generalized Label Request

   [RFC4328] extends the LSP Encoding Type, the Switching Type, and
   G-PID (Generalized-PID) values to accommodate G.709 Recommendation
   [ITUT-G.709].  Signaling of ODU0 LSP must comply with these
   extensions.

   An additional LSP Encoding Type code-point for the G.709 Digital Path
   layer must be used in ODU0 LSP and an ODU0 switching (and thus LSPs)
   belongs to the TDM class.


4.  G.709 Traffic Parameters

   The G.709 traffic parameters, see [RFC4328], need to be used while
   signaling ODU0 LSP, A new value of signal type for ODU0 needs to be
   assigned.


5.  ODUk Label Space

   For the compatibility considerations, ODUk (k = 0, 1, 2, 3) label has

   the following format:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |                   Reserved            |t0 |     t3    | t2  |t1|
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Reserved bits MUST be set to zero when sent and SHOULD be ignored
   when received.

   The specification of the fields t0, t1, t2, and t3 self-consistently
   characterizes the ODUk label space.  When t0 is set to zero, the
   meaning of t1, t2 and t3 is identical to which defined in [RFC4328].

   When t0 is not set to zero, the value space for the t0, t1, t2, and
   t3 fields is defined as follows:

   1.  t0 (2-bit):

       -  t0=[1..2] indicates the index of an ODU0 within an ODU1.

   2.  t1 (1-bit):

       -  t1=1 indicates that an ODU1 which is multiplexed from ODU0 is
          mapped into an OTU1.

       -  t1 is not significant if the ODU1 is multiplexed into an
          ODTUG2 or ODTUG3 (i.e., t1 value MUST be set to 0 and
          ignored).

   3.  t2 (3-bit):

       -  t2=[2..5] indicates the tributary slot (t2th-1) used by the
          ODU1 in an ODTUG2 mapped into an ODU2 (via OPU2) and then ODU2
          is mapped into an OTU2.

          The ODU1 which is described above is multiplexed from ODU0.

       -  t2 is not significant if the ODU1 is mapped into an OTU1 or
          the ODU1 is multiplexed into an ODTUG3 (i.e., t2 value MUST be
          set to 0 and ignored).

   4.  t3 (6-bit):

       -  t3=[2..17] indicates the tributary slot (t3th-1) used by the
          ODU1 in an ODTUG3 mapped into an ODU3 (via OPU3) and then ODU3
          is mapped into an OTU3.

          The ODU1 which is described above is multiplexed from ODU0.

       -  t3 is not significant if the ODU1 is mapped into an OTU1,or
          the ODU1 is multiplexed into an ODTUG2 mapped into an ODU2
          mapped into an OTU2(i.e., t3 value MUST be set to 0 and
          ignored).



   Examples:

   -  t3=0, t2=0, t1=1, t0=1 indicates an ODU0 multiplexed into an ODU1
      mapped into an OTU1

   -  t3=0, t2=3, t1=0, t0=2 indicates an ODU0 multiplexed into an ODU1
      in the second tributary slot of the ODTUG2 mapped into an ODU2
      mapped into an OTU2

   -  t3=5, t2=0, t1=0, t0=2 indicates an ODU0 multiplexed into an ODU1
      in the fourth tributary slot of the ODTUG3 mapped into an ODU3
      mapped into an OTU3

   Note that an ODUk label always has to be interpreted according the
   G.709 traffic parameters defined in Section 3.
