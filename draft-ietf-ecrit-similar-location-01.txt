     A LoST extension to return complete and similar location info
                  draft-ietf-ecrit-similar-location-01

Abstract

   This document introduces a new way to provide returned location
   information in LoST responses that is either of a completed or
   similar form to the original input civic location, based on whether
   valid or invalid civic address elements are returned within the
   findServiceResponse message.  This document defines a new extension
   to the findServiceResponse message within the LoST protocol [RFC5222]
   that enables the LoST protocol to return a completed civic address
   element set for a valid location response, and one or more suggested
   sets of similar location information for invalid LoST responses.
   These two types of civic addresses are referred to as either
   "complete location" or "similar location", and are included as
   compilation of ca type xml elements within the existing LoST
   findServiceResponse message structure.

1.  Introduction

   The LoST protcol [RFC5222] supports the validation of civic location
   information as input, by providing a set of validation result status
   indicators.  The current usefulness of the supported xml elements,
   "valid", "invalid", and "unchecked", is limited, because while they
   each provide an indication of validity for any one location element
   as a part of the whole civic address, the mechanism is insufficient
   in providing either the complete set of civic address elements that
   the LoST server contains, or of providing alternate suggestions
   (hints) as to which civic address is intended for use.

   Whether the input civic location is valid and missing information, or
   invalid due to missing or wrong information during input, this

Internet-Draft    Returned Location Extensions to LoST      October 2015


   document provides a mechanism to return a complete set of civic
   address elements for those valid or invalid cases.

   This enhancement to the validation feature within LoST is required by
   systems that rely on accurate location for processing in order to
   increase the likelihood that the correct and/or complete form of a
   civic location becomes known in those cases where it is incomplete or
   just plain wrong.  One such use case is that of location based
   emergency calling.  The use of this protocol extension will reduce
   user and system input errors, and will result in a higher level of
   civic address matching, reducing the number of mismatch errors, where
   a civic address that appears to be valid gets wrongly associated with
   the physical location of the caller.

   The structure of this document includes terminology, Section 2,
   followed by a discussion of the basic elements involved in location
   validation.  The use of these elements, by way of example, is
   discussed in an overview section, Section 3, with accompanying
   rationale, and a brief discussion of the impacts to LoST, and its
   current schema.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   The following terms are defined in this document:

   Location:  The term Location can be used to refer to either a civic
      location or a geodetic location.

   Geodetic Location:  a geographic coordinate set of values that
      describes a point within a defined geographic datum.  For example,
      a WGS84 referenced lattitude, longitude coordinate pair (2D), or
      lattitude, longitude, and altitude (3D).  Note: geodetic location
      is defined here for context, but is not used elsewhere within this
      document.

   Civic Location:  The term civic location applies to a set of one or
      more civic address elements that are used in conjunction with each
      other, and in accordance with a known ruleset to designates a
      place within a defined grid or basemap, The example used within
      this document is a street address as defined in [RFC5139]

   Civic Address:  The term Civic Address is used interchangeably with
      the term Civic Location within this document.

Internet-Draft    Returned Location Extensions to LoST      October 2015


   Street Address:  The term Street Address is used to represent a
      place, or location on a defined grid or map.  While generally
      equated to both terms, Civic Location and Civic Address, it is not
      used within this document.

   Civic Address Element:  The term Civic Address Element is used within
      this document to apply to an individual CAtype data descriptor,
      for example, as is described in [RFC4776], [RFC5774], and
      [RFC6848]

   Invalid:  The status result of the unsuccessful attempt to match an
      individual input data as part of a larger set of data that has
      already been successfully matched and as shown by the [RFC5222]
      defined xml named element

   Valid:  The status result of the successful attempt to match an
      individual input data as part of a larger set of data that has
      already also been successfully matched and shown by the [RFC5222]
      defined xml named element

   Invalid Location:  A Civic Location that was included in a LoST
      request and subsequently returned with one or more civic address
      elements marked as invalid.

   Valid Location:  A Civic Location that was included in a LoST request
      and subsequently returned with all civic address elements marked
      as valid.

   Complete Location:  An expanded civic location that includes other
      civic address elements in addition to the existing validated civic
      address elements provided as input to a LoST server.

   Similar Location:  A suggested civic location that is comparatively
      close to the civic location which was input, but which had one or
      more invalid civic address elements returned by the LoST server.

   Returned Location Information:  A set of standard civic address
      elements returned in a LoST response.

3.  Overview of Returned Location Information

   This document describes an extension to LoST [RFC5222] to allow
   additional location information to be returned in a
   findServiceResponse for two different use cases.

   When a LoST server is asked to validate a civic location, its goal is
   to take the set of civic address elements provided as the location
   information in the LoST request, and find a unique location in its



Marshall, et al.         Expires April 21, 2016                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft    Returned Location Extensions to LoST      October 2015


   database that matches the information in the request.  Uniqueness
   might not require values for all possible elements in the civic
   address that the database might hold.  Further, the input location
   information might not represent the form of location the users of the
   LoST service prefer to have.  As an example, there are LoST civic
   address elements that could be used to define a postal location,
   suitable for delivery mail as well as a municipal location suitable
   for responding to an emergency call.  While the LoST server might be
   able to determine the location from the postal elements provided, the
   emergency services would prefer that the municipal location be used
   for any subsequent emergency call.  Since validation is often
   performed well in advance of an end-user placing an emergency call,
   if the LoST server could return the preferred form of location (or
   more properly in this example, the municipal elements in addition to
   the postal elements), those elements could be stored in a LIS and
   used in a later emergency call.

   Since a LoST server often contains more data than what is included
   within a findService request, it is expected that this additional
   location information, if present, SHOULD only be returned within
   response messages that contain only valid civic address elements in
   the corresponding request, and where the set of valid civic address
   elements in the request identify a unique location.  Where a LoST
   server contains additional location information relating to that
   civic address, the findServiceResponse message MAY return additional
   location information along with the original validated civic address
   elements in order to form a complete location based on local
   implementation policy.

   In addition, this document describes the reuse of the same mechanism,
   but for a different purpose: to supply similar location information
   in the case where a LoST server response includes one or more civic
   address elements marked as invalid, constituting an invalid location
   response.  In this case, the response contains one or more suggested
   alternative, but valid locations.

   Clients MAY ignore the location information this extension defines in
   the response.  The information is optional to send, and optional to
   use.  In the case where the location information in the request was
   valid, this extension does not change the validity.  In the case
   where the location information in the request is invalid, but
   alternate location information is returned, the original location
   remains invalid, and the LoST server does not change the mapping
   response other than optionally including the information defined by
   this extension.

   In a valid location response, a LoST server returns a response to a
   findService request that contains a set of civic address elements



Marshall, et al.         Expires April 21, 2016                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft    Returned Location Extensions to LoST      October 2015


   marked valid, the location information in the findServiceResponse
   message MAY be extended to include additional location information
   specific for that location.  As an example, the query might contain a
   HNO (house number), RD (road name) and A3 (city) and a few more
   caType elements, but might not contain A1 (state) or PC (Postal Code)
   CAtypes.  The HNO, RD, STS, POD, and A3 civic address elements might
   be sufficient enough to the LoST server to uniquely locate the
   address specified in the request and thus be considered valid.  Yet,
   downstream entities might find it helpful to have the additional
   country, A1 (state), and PC, (Postal Code), civic address elements
   that are present within the LoST server, be included as part of a
   complete location response.  Since [RFC5222] currently does not have
   a way for this additional location information to be returned in the
   findServiceResponse, this document extends the LoST protocol so that
   it can include a completeLocation element within the
   findServiceResponse message, allowing for the representation of
   complete location information.

   An example showing complete location information supplied:

   input address: 6000 15th Ave NW Seattle

   complete location: 6000 15th Ave NW Seattle, WA 98105 US

   By contrast, when invalid location is received from the LoST server,
   with this extension, the same mechanism works as follows: if a LoST
   server returns a response to a findService request that contains a
   set of civic address elements with one or more labeled as invalid,
   the location information in the findServiceResponse is extended to
   include additional location information that it suspects might be the
   location desired.

   In the example cited above, policy at the LoST server might deem a
   missing A3 element as invalid, even if the location information in
   the request was sufficient to identify a unique address.  In that
   case, the missing element would be listed in the invalid list, and
   similarLocation could be returned in the response showing the missing
   elements including A3, the same as the above example.

   As another example of the use of similarLocation, consider the
   results based on a similar data set as used above, where the HNO, RD,
   STS, A1, and A3 civic address elements are not sufficient to locate a
   unique address, which leads to an invalid location result.  This is
   the case, despite the fact that the LoST server typically contains
   additional civic address elements which could have resulted in a
   uniquely identifiable location if additional data had been supplied
   with the query.  Since [RFC5222] currently does not have a way for
   this additional location information to be returned in the

Internet-Draft    Returned Location Extensions to LoST      October 2015


   findServiceResponse, this document extends [RFC5222] so that the LoST
   findServiceResponse message can include one or more similarLocation
   elements within the findServiceResponse message representing similar
   civic locations.

   To show this, suppose that a slightly modified address as above is
   inserted within a Lost findService request:

   input address: 6000 15th Ave N Seattle, WA.

   This time we make the assumption that the address is deemed "invalid"
   by the LoST server because there is no such thing as "15th Ave N"
   within the LoST server's data for the city of Seattle.  However, we
   also happen to know for this example that there are two addresses
   within the address dataset that are "similar", when all parts of the
   address are taken as a whole.  These similar addresses that could be
   suggested to the user are as follows:

   similar address #1: 6000 15th Ave NW Seattle, WA 98107

   similar address #2: 6000 15th Ave NE Seattle, WA 98105

   This extension would allow the LoST server to include the above
   similar addresses as civicAddress elements in the response to
   locationValidation.  The next section shows examples of the LoST
   request and response xml message fragments for the above valid and
   invalid scenarios, returning the complete or similar addresses,
   respectively:

4.  Returned Location Information

   The LoST server implementing this extension MAY include
   completeLocation or similarLocation in the findService response.
   completeLocation and similarLocation contain a list of civic address
   elements identical to the elements used in the location element with
   the "civic profile".

5.  Complete Location returned for Valid Location response

   Based on the example input request, returned location information is
   provided in a findServiceResponse message when the original input
   address is considered valid, but is missing some additional data that
   the LoST server has.

8.  Security Considerations

   Whether the input to the LoST server is valid or invalid, the LoST
   server ultimately determines what it considers to be valid.  Even in
   the case where the input location is valid, the requester still might
   not actually understand where that location is.  For this kind of
   valid location use case, this described extension would typically
   return more location information than the requester started with,
   which might reveal more about the location.  While this might be very
   desirable in some scenarios including, for example, supporting an
   emergency call, it might not be as desirable for other services.
   Individual LoST server implementations SHOULD consider the risk of
   releasing more detail verses the value in doing so.  Generally, it is
   not expected that this would be a significant problem as the
   requester must have enough location information to be considered
   valid, which in most cases is enough to uniquely locate the address.
   Providing more CAtypes generally doesn't actually reveal anything
   more.  For invalid locations that are submitted, this extension would
   allow the LoST response to include location information which is
   similar to what was input, again resulting in more information
   provided in the response than was known during input.  LoST server
   implementations SHOULD evaluate the particular use cases where this
   extension is supported, and weigh the risks around its use.  Many
   similar database services available today via the Internet offer

   similar features, such as "did you mean", and address completion, so
   this capability is not introducing any fundamentally new threat.

9.1.  Relax NG Schema Registration

      URI:  urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:lost-rli1

      Registrant Contact:  IETF ECRIT Working Group, Brian Rosen
         (br@brianrosen.net).

      Relax NG Schema: The Relax NG schema to be registered is contained
         in Section 7.  Its first line is

      default namespace = "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:lost-rli1

      and its last line is
