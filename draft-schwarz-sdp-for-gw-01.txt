Abstract

   SDP is used in many signalling protocols at call control level (such
   as SAP, SIP, BICC), bearer control level (such as RTSP, IPBCP) and
   gateway control level (such as H.248/MEGACO, MGCP). Scope of this RFC
   is related to gateway control specific SDP usage. Gateway control
   protocols do usually NOT define and introduce any new SDP parameters,
   however, gateway control protocols need specific SDP parameter values
   in addition to SDP usage at call or bearer control level. Such SDP
   codepoints are collected by this RFC with the purpose of registration
   with IANA.

1. Introduction

1.1. Background - Gateway control protocols in scope

   Gateway control protocols are required for decomposed network
   elements which separating media plane and signalling plane related
   network functions (see e.g., [RFC7092] concerning a decomposed B2BUA
   with a SIP specific signalling B2BUA plus a media plane B2BUA
   entity).

   The gateway control interface between the controlling entity (known
   as media gateway controller MGC) and controlled entity (known as
   media gateway) follows a disclosed, open, standardized protocol.

   This RFC considers such gateway control protocols which use the SDP
   [RFC4566] as embeded signalling for media-related characteristics.

   This RFC focuses on following gateway control protocol, known as
   "H.248", as standardized within the ITU-T H.248.x-series of
   Recommendations [ITU-T H.248.x]. The core protocol is defined by
   H.248.1 [ITU-T H.248.1], which actually originates in the IETF, known
   as MEGACO (media gateway control):

   IETF history:

   o  Closed working group "MEGACO" (since technology was transferred to
      ITU-T);

   o  IETF MEGACO protocol versions: see [RFC2885], [RFC3015],
      [RFC3525];

   o  Transfer IETF to ITU-T: "Reclassification of RFC 3525 to
      Historic", [RFC5125].

1.2. Background - SDP usage in gateway control protocol(s)

   Gateway control protocol H.248 supports two message encoding modes:
   binary and text. Gateway deployments in IP network environments use
   primarily H.248 text encoding mode in order to benefit from SDP usage
   at call control signalling level. For instance, the SIP level SDP
   information is mapped by the H.248 MGC entity to SDP information as
   used in H.248 gateway control signaling. Following list indicates
   typical areas in H.248 gateway control:

   o  SDP in H.248: clause 7.1.8 "Local and Remote Descriptors" and
      particularily clause 7.1.8.1.1.2 "Summary - ITU-T H.248 usage of
      SDP" in [ITU-T H.248.1];

   o  Wildcarding in SDP: "H.248 SDP parameter identification and
      wildcarding" [ITU-T H.248.39];

   o  SDP versioning: "SDP RFC and capabilities packages", [ITU-T
      H.248.49];

   o  SDP profiling: the allowed SDP elements and codespace could be
      limited by H.248 profile specifications, see "ITU-T H.248 profile
      definition template" in Appendix III/[ITU-T H.248.1] (profile
      template clauses 6.15 and 6.16 are related to SDP);

   o  SDP offer/answer models: "Usage of the revised SDP offer / answer
      model with H.248", [ITU-T H.248.80];

   o  SDP mapping between call control and H.248: "SDP Interworking
      between Call/Session Control Protocols (SIP/SDP, RTSP/SDP; etc.)
      and the Gateway Control Protocol (H.248/SDP)" [ETSI 183046].

   o  SDP for mode control in border gateways: see Annex G "Illustration
      of BGF modes of operation" and particularily Annex G.2 "BGF modes
      driven by particular SDP lines" [ETSI 183068].



1.3. Motivation - Why gateway control specific SDP?

   Gateway control protocol (GCP) specific SDP codepoints are primarily
   required in two areas:

   1. SDP for bearer type indication

   2. SDP for controlling the mode of operation of a gateway



Schwarz               Expires September 27, 2014               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft    SDP codepoints for gateway control         March 2014


   Clause 3 provides detailed background and [ETSI 183068], Annex G
   indicates a bunch of illustrative examples in the area of IP-to-IP
   gateways (also known as border gateways).

1.4. Scope

   Collection of SDP codepoints, which are specific to gateway control
   protocols, with the purpose of registration with IANA. The focus is
   (but not limited to) on SDP codepoints related to the SDP "m=" line.

2. Conventions used in this document

2.1. Prescriptive language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

2.2. Terminology used

   APPLICATION:

     This term, when used in the context of "application-agnostic" or
     "application-aware", refers to the IP application protocol on top
     of a "L4 transport protocol" (e.g., "TCP", "UDP") with or without a
     "transport security protocol" (e.g., "TLS", "DTLS").

     NOTE - The notion of application includes (if present) also the
     associated protocol layer of "application level framing protocol"
     (e.g., "RTP").

   BORDER GATEWAY:

     A H.248 packet-to-packet (media) gateway, such as an IP-to-IP
     gateway, with scope on two-party communication services.
     NOTE: not to be confused with border gateway entities in the native
     IP router space, such as a border router with support of border
     gateway protocols (such as BGP, e.g. [RFC1163]).

   CODEPOINT:

     The combination of a "signalling parameter" plus assigned "value"
     in protocol engineering. The "value" represents a codepoint (or
     code position) in the code space.

   X-AGNOSTIC / X-AWARE:



Schwarz               Expires September 27, 2014               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft    SDP codepoints for gateway control         March 2014


     Placeholder 'X' denotes a protocol layer, a protocol stack or an
     abtracted model such as "application", "media", "transport", etc.
     This term indicates whether the controlled entity (here: H.248 MG)
     becomes aware or not about information concerning 'X'.

3. Decomposed gateways - usage of SDP

   Gateway control protocol (GCP) specific SDP codepoints are primarily
   required in two areas:

3.1. SDP for bearer type indication

   The bearer connection endpoint at media gateway level needs to be
   specified concerning the required bearer protocol or protocol stack
   segment respectively. This relates essentially to the SDP "m="line
   <proto> element. However, media gateways require in addition so
   called "agnostic" type of SDP codepoints, which is in contrast to the
   so called application-aware, transport protocol type aware, etc SDP
   codepoints used by communication endpoints (such as a SIP UA located
   in an IP host entity).

3.2. SDP for controlling the mode of operation of a gateway

   A media gateway (MG) is typically interconnecting internally multiple
   bearer connection endpoints. A plethora of interworking functions
   (IWF) may be supported in the media plane by the MG. The type of IWF
   is known as mode of operation, and typically controlled via SDP. The
   semantic is actually the result of the SDP information of ALL
   involved bearer connection endpoints (in H.248: terminations / stream
   endpoints) and/or BOTH traffic directions (if applicable).

4. SDP codepoints related to "m="-line <proto> element

4.1. Purpose

   The SDP "m=" line <proto> element allows the indication of

   a) a single protocol (layer) or

   b) a protocol stack (i.e., multiple, consecutive protocol layers).

   The protocol stack based value is inherently ambiguous in case of the
   requirement in indicating a particular protocol layer out of the
   stack. This is a well-known issue of this element.

4.2. Application-agnostic indications

   Application-agnostic, - or X-agnostic in general -, indications are
   typically realized by using character "-" instead of a concrete value
   in SDP fields (see [ITU-T H.248.39]). Such an SDP value is basically
   out of scope of IANA registration.

Internet-Draft    SDP codepoints for gateway control         March 2014


4.3. Protocol individual indications

   FIXTHIS - This is related to the indication of single protocol layer
   related endpoints in stream endpoint interlinkage configurations, see
   [ITU-T H.248.92].

4.4. SDP codepoints related to "m="-line <type> element

   None specific from H.248 perspective.

4.5. SDP codepoints related to "m="-line <proto> element

   See [ITU-T H.Supp.IANA].

   Editor's note: this is still work in progress.

5. SDP codepoints related to "a="-lines (SDP attributes)

5.1. SDP attribute "ITU-T H.248 package"

   ITU-T Recommendation [ITU-T H.248.15] defines an ITU-T specific
   extension for SDP. The SDP attribute "a=h248item:" allows for the
   carriage of general ITU-T H.248 properties in the local and remote
   descriptor in the textual ITU-T H.248 protocol encoding mode.

6. Security Considerations

   This RFC is related to the registration of protocol codepoints, thus
   outside any security aspects.

7. IANA Considerations

7.1. SDP codepoints related to "m="-line <proto> element

   This document updates the "Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   Parameters" registry as specified in Section 8.2.2 of [RFC4566].
   Specifically, it adds the values in Table 1 to the table for the SDP
   "proto" field registry.
