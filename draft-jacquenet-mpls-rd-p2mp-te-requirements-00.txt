                  Receiver Driven P2MP TE Requirements
           draft-jacquenet-mpls-rd-p2mp-te-requirements-00.txt

Abstract

   This document presents a set of requirements for the establishment
   and maintenance of receiver driven Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP)
   Traffic-Engineered (TE) Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label
   Switched Paths (LSPs).

   There is no intent to specify solution-specific details or
   application-specific requirements in this document.

   The requirements presented in this document not only apply to packet-
   switched networks under the control of MPLS protocols, but also
   encompass the requirements of Layer Two Switching (L2SC), Time
   Division Multiplexing (TDM), lambda, and port switching networks
   managed by Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) protocols.  Protocol solutions
   developed to meet the requirements set out in this document must
   attempt to be equally applicable to MPLS and GMPLS.

Internet-Draft           RD P2MP TE Requirements            October 2010


1.  Introduction

   Multiparty multimedia applications are getting greater attention in
   the telecom world.  Such applications are QoS-demanding and can
   therefore benefit from the activation of MPLS traffic engineering
   capabilities that lead to the dynamic computation and establishment
   of MPLS LSPs whose characteristics comply with application-specific
   QoS requirements.  P2MP-RE-REQ[RFC4461] specifies the signalling
   requirements to setup multipoint LSPs from sender to receiver.
   P2MP-TE [RFC4875] defines the procedure to setup multipoint LSPs from
   sender to receiver.  This document presents a set of requirements
   specific for the establishment and maintenance of receiver-driven
   P2MP-TE LSPs.

1.1.  Motivation

   IP multicast distribution trees are receiver-initiated and dynamic by
   nature.  IP multicast-enabled applications are also bandwidth savvy,
   especially in the area of residential IPTV services, where several
   hundreds of thousands of IPTV receivers need to be served with the
   appropriate level of quality.  Current source-driven P2MP LSP
   establishment assumes a prior knowledge of receiver(s) location for
   the sake of the P2MP LSP tree structure's forwarding efficiency.  But
   the receiver's location information is not available a priori for the
   root MPLS router to compute and establish the relevant P2MP tree
   structure.

   Receiver-driven MPLS P2MP tree structure do not require sender to
   maintain/discover receiver information a priori, and their design is
   meant to better accommodate the receiver-specific QoS conditions,
   such as network access capabilities.

1.2.  Terminology

   With the receiver-driven concept, we have re-defined the following
   terms:

   o  Sender: Sender refers to the Originator (and hence) Sender of the
      content/payload.  As in [RFC2205].

   o  Receiver: Receiver refers to the Receiver of the content/payload.
      As in [RFC2205].

   o  Upstream: The direction of flow from content Receiver toward
      content Sender.  As defined in [RFC2205].

   o  Downstream: The direction of flow from content Sender toward
      content Receiver.  As defined in [RFC2205].

   o  Path-Sender: The sender of the RSVP PATH message, with NO
      correlation to direction of content/payload flow.  All other
      control message flows discussed in this document also assume no
      correlation with the direction of content flows.

   o  Path-Receiver: The receiver of the RSVP PATH message, with NO
      correlation to direction of content/payload flow.

   o  Path-Initiator: The Path-Sender that originated the RSVP PATH
      message.  This being different from Path-Sender because an
      intermediate node can be a Path-Sender, but different from the
      node that created and initiated the RSVP PATH message, the Path-
      Initiator.

   o  Path-Terminator: The Path-Receiver that does NOT propagate the
      Path message.  This being different from Path-Receiver because an
      intermediate node can be a Path-Receiver.

1.3.  What is not covered in this document

   This document does not specify any requirements for the following
   functions.

   o  Discovery of root for a P2MP LSP.

   o  Algorithms for computing P2MP distribution trees.

   o  Hierarchical P2MP LSPs.

   o  OAM for P2MP LSPs.

   o  Inter-area and inter-AS P2MP TE LSPs.

   o  Applicability of P2MP MPLS TE LSPs to service scenarios.

   o  Application-specific requirements.

   o  Multipoint-to-point LSPs.

   o  Multipoint-to-multipoint LSPs.

   o  Routing protocols.

   o  Construction of the traffic engineering database.

   o  Distribution of the information used to construct the traffic
      engineering database.

Internet-Draft           RD P2MP TE Requirements            October 2010


2.  Basic Requirements

   [RFC4461] specifies requirements for P2MP traffic engineering over
   MPLS.  It describes sender driven P2MP traffic engineering in detail.
   Those definitions and requirements which are equally applicable to
   receiver driven traffic engineering in a point-to-multipoint service
   environment, they are not repeated here.

   Following are key requirements that are specific to the receiver-
   driven paradigm:

   1.   In order to scale well with a large number of leaves it is
        RECOMMENDED to follow a leaf-initiated P2MP LSP setup approach.
        For that purpose, leaves will have to be aware of the P2MP LSP
        identifier.  The ways a Leaf LSR discovers P2MP LSPs identifiers
        rely on the applications that will use P2MP LSPs, and are out of
        the scope of this document.

   2.   The RD P2MP TE mechanism MUST allow the dynamic addition and
        removal of leaves to and from a P2MP LSP, without any
        restriction (provided there is network connectivity).  It is
        RECOMMENDED that these operations be leaf-initiated.

   3.   These operations for the dynamic addition and removal of leaves
        to and from a RD P2MP LSP MUST not impact the data transfer
        (packet loss, duplication, delay) towards other leaves.

   4.   It is RECOMMENDED that these operations do not cause any
        additional processing except on the path from the added/removed
        Leaf LSR to the Branch LSR.

   5.   Receivers MUST trigger the grafting of a new leaf of a given RD
        P2MP tree structure.  This assumes the processing of an IGMP or
        MLD Report message by the leaf LSR router directly connected to
        the receiver, so that it can behave as a Path_Initiator and send
        the RSVP_PATH message accordingly.

   6.   The destination of a L2S (Leaf to Source) sub-path SHOULD be the 
        ingress router of the RD P2MP multicast tree and this ingress 
        router is the entry point where the contents transported by the RD 
        P2MP TE LSP enter from

   7.   RSVP P2MP PATH messages MUST traverse along the path from
        receiver to senders.

   8.   RSVP P2MP RESV messages MUST traverse along the path from the
        sender to the receiver if the leaf is the first leaf of the RD
        P2MP TE LSP.  Otherwise it will be forwarded by the PATH
        Terminator towards the PATH Initiator, which, in that case, is

Internet-Draft           RD P2MP TE Requirements            October 2010


        an intermediate node of the RD P2MP tree structure.

   9.   A node receiving a RSVP RESV message SHOULD be interpreted as
        successful resource reservation from the upstream node.

   10.  Label allocation on incoming interface MUST be done prior to
        sending RSVP PATH messages upstream.

   11.  A node receiving a RSVP PATH message MUST first decide if this
        RSVP PATH message will make itself a branch LSR or not.  In the
        case that it will become a transit LSR because of this PATH
        message, then it will allocate required resources on the
        interface through which the RSVP PATH message is received,
        before sending the RSVP PATH message upstream.  So that the
        upstream node can send traffic soon after successfully reserving
        resources on the downstream link, on which the RSVP PATH message
        SHOULD be received.  In the case that the node is a branch or
        transit node already before it receives the PATH message, then
        it will allocate required resources on the interface through
        which the RSVP PATH message is received, and send the RESV
        message to the node which sends the PATH message without sending
        the PATH message to the upstream node.


3.  Detailed Requirements

3.1.  RD P2MP LSP

   The RD P2MP TE extensions MUST be applicable to the signaling of LSPs
   for different switching types.  For example, it MUST be possible to
   signal a P2MP TE LSP in any switching medium, whether it is packet or
   non-packet based (including frame, cell, TDM, lambda, etc.).

   As with P2P MPLS technology [RFC3031], traffic is classified with a
   FEC in this extension.  All packets that belong to a particular FEC
   and that travel from a particular node MUST follow the same RD P2MP
   tree.

   In order to scale to a large number of branches, P2MP TE LSPs SHOULD
   be identified by a unique identifier (the P2MP ID or P2ID) that is
   constant for the whole LSP regardless of the number of branches
   and/or leaves.

3.2.  P2MP TE LSP Establishment, Teardown, and Modification Mechanisms

   The P2MP TE solution MUST support the dynamic establishment,
   maintenance, and teardown of RD P2MP TE LSPs in a manner that is at
   least scalable in a linear way.  This MUST include both the existence



Jacquenet & Zhao         Expires April 18, 2011                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft           RD P2MP TE Requirements            October 2010


   of very many LSPs at once, and the existence of very many
   destinations for a single P2MP LSP.

   In addition to RD P2MP TE LSP establishment and teardown mechanisms,
   the solution SHOULD support a partial RD P2MP tree modification
   mechanism, for the sake of path computation optimization.

   For the purpose of adding sub-P2MP TE LSPs to an existing RD P2MP TE
   LSP, the extensions SHOULD support a grafting mechanism.  For the
   purpose of deleting a sub-P2MP TE LSPs from an existing P2MP TE LSP,
   the extensions SHOULD support a pruning mechanism.

   It is RECOMMENDED that these grafting and pruning operations cause no
   additional processing in nodes that are not along the path from the
   grafting or pruning node to the upstream branch node.  Moreover, both
   grafting and pruning operations MUST NOT disrupt traffic that is
   being forwarded along the P2MP tree.

   There is no assumption that the explicitly routed P2MP LSP remains on
   an optimal path after several grafts and prunes have occurred.  In
   this context, scalable refers to the signaling process for the RD
   P2MP TE LSP.  The TE nature of the LSP allows that re-optimization
   may take place from time to time to restore the optimality of the
   LSP.

3.3.  Re-Optimization of RD P2MP TE LSPs

   The detection of a more optimal path (for example, one with a lower
   overall cost) is an example of a situation where P2MP TE LSP re-
   routing may be required.  While re-routing is in progress, an
   important requirement is to avoid double bandwidth reservation (over
   the common parts between the old and new LSP) through the use of
   resource sharing.

   Make-before-break MUST be supported for a RD P2MP TE LSP to ensure
   that there is minimal traffic disruption when the RD P2MP TE LSP is
   re- routed.

   Make-before-break that only applies to a sub-P2MP tree without
   impacting the data on all the other parts of the P2MP tree MUST be
   supported.

   The solution SHOULD allow for make-before-break re-optimization of
   any subdivision of the P2MP LSP, it SHOULD do so by not having any
   signaling affect the stability of the rest of the P2MP LSP, and
   without affecting the ability of the management plane to manage the
   LSP.

Internet-Draft           RD P2MP TE Requirements            October 2010


   The solution SHOULD also provide the ability for any downstream LSR
   to have control over the re-optimization process.

   Where sub-LSP re-optimization is allowed by the ingress LSR, such re-
   optimization MAY be initiated by a downstream LSR that is the root of
   the sub-LSP that is to be re-optimized.  Sub-LSP re-optimization
   initiated by a downstream LSR MUST be carried out with the same
   regard to minimizing the impact on active traffic as was described
   above for other re-optimization.

3.4.  Merging of Tree Branches

   It is possible for a single transit LSR to receive multiple signaling
   messages for the same RD P2MP LSP but for different sets of
   destinations.  These messages may be received from the same or
   different path sender nodes and may need to be passed on to the same
   or different upstream nodes.

   This situation may arise as the result of the signaling solution
   definition or implementation options within the signaling solution.
   Further, it may happen during make-before-break re-optimization.

   It is even possible that it is necessary to construct distinct
   upstream branches in order to achieve the correct label choices in
   certain switching technologies managed by GMPLS (for example,
   photonic cross-connects where the selection of a particular lambda
   for the downstream branches is only available on different upstream
   switches).

   The solution MUST support the case where multiple signaling messages
   for the same P2MP LSP are received at a single transit LSR and refer
   to the same upstream interface.  In this case, the result of the
   protocol procedures SHOULD be a single data flow on the upstream
   interface.

   The solution SHOULD support the case where multiple signaling
   messages for the same P2MP LSP are received at a single transit LSR
   and refer to different upstream interfaces, and where each signaling
   message results in the use of different upstream interfaces.  This
   case represents data flows that cross at the LSR but that do not
   merge.

   The solution MAY support the case where multiple signaling messages
   for the same P2MP LSP are received at a single transit LSR and refer
   to different downstream interfaces, and where the upstream interfaces
   are shared across the received signaling messages.  This case
   represents the merging of data flows.  A solution that supports this
   case MUST ensure that data is not replicated on the upstream



Jacquenet & Zhao         Expires April 18, 2011                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft           RD P2MP TE Requirements            October 2010


   interfaces.

   An alternative to supporting this last case is for the signaling
   protocol to indicate an error such that the merge may be resolved by
   the upstream LSRs.

3.5.  Support for LAN interfaces

   RD P2MP MPLS TE may be used to traverse network segments that are
   provided by multi-access media such as Ethernet.  In these cases, it
   is also possible that the entry point to the network segment is a
   branch LSR of the P2MP LSP.

   To avoid all replicated data are sent through the same port and
   carried on the same segment, a solution MUST provide a mechanism for
   a branch LSR to send a single copy of the data onto a multi-access
   network to reach multiple (adjacent) downstream nodes.

   The RD P2MP TE mechanism SHOULD provide a way for a Branch LSR to
   send a single copy of the data onto an Ethernet LAN interface and
   reach multiple adjacent downstream nodes.  This requires that the
   same label be negotiated with all downstream LSRs for the LSP.

   When there are several candidate upstream LSRs on a LAN interface,
   the RD P2MP TE mechanism SHOULD provide a way for all downstream LSRs
   of a given P2MP LSP to select the same upstream LSR, so as to avoid
   traffic replication.  In addition, the RD P2MP TE mechanism SHOULD
   allow for an efficient balancing of a set of P2MP LSPs among a set of
   candidate upstream LSRs on a LAN interface.

3.6.  P2MP MPLS Label

   A RD P2MP TE solution MUST allow the continued use of existing
   techniques to establish P2P and legacy P2MP LSPs (TE and otherwise)
   within the same network, and MUST allow the coexistence of P2P and
   legacy P2MP LSPs within the same network as RD P2MP TE LSPs.

   A RD P2MP TE solution MUST be specified in such a way that it allows
   legacy P2MP and P2P TE LSPs to be signaled on the same interface.

3.7.  Advertisement of RD P2MP Capability

   To facilitate the computation of RD P2MP trees using TE constraints
   within a network that contains LSRs that do not all have the same
   capability levels with respect to RD P2MP signaling and data
   forwarding, the capability of an LSR to support the RD signalling and
   forwarding SHOULD be advertised to its neighbor LSRs.

Internet-Draft           RD P2MP TE Requirements            October 2010


3.8.  Scalability

   Scalability is a key requirement in P2MP MPLS systems.  Solutions
   MUST be designed to scale well with an increase in the number of any
   of the following:

   o  the number of recipients

   o  the number of egress LSRs

   o  the number of branch LSRs

   o  the number of branches

   Both scalability of control plane operation (setup, maintenance,
   modification, and teardown) MUST be considered.

   Key considerations MUST include:

   o  the amount of refresh processing associated with maintaining a
      P2MP TE LSP.

   o  the amount of protocol state that must be maintained by ingress
      and transit LSRs along a P2MP tree.

   o  the number of protocol messages required to set up or tear down a
      RD P2MP LSP as a function of the number of egress LSRs.

   o  the number of protocol messages required to repair a P2MP LSP
      after failure or to perform make-before-break.

   o  the amount of protocol information transmitted to manage a P2MP TE
      LSP (i.e., the message size).

   o  the amount of additional data distributed in potential routing
      extensions.

   o  the amount of additional control plane processing required in the
      network to detect whether an add/delete of a new branch is
      required, and in particular, the amount of processing in steady
      state when no add/delete is requested

   o  the amount of control plane processing required by the ingress,
      transit, and egress LSRs to add/delete a branch LSP to/from an
      existing P2MP LSP.

   o  It is expected that the applicability of each solution will be
      evaluated with regards to the aforementioned scalability criteria.

Internet-Draft           RD P2MP TE Requirements            October 2010


   In order to scale well with an increase in the number of leaves, it
   is RECOMMENDED that the size of a P2MP LSP state on a LSR, for one
   particular LSP, depend only on the number of adjacent LSRs on the
   LSP.

3.9.  Variation of LSP Parameters

   Certain parameters (such as priority and bandwidth) are associated
   with an LSP.  The parameters are installed by the signaling exchanges
   associated with establishing and maintaining the LSP.

   Any solution MUST NOT allow for variance of these parameters within a
   single P2MP LSP.  That is:

   o  No attributes set and signaled by the first leaf LSR of a P2MP LSP
      may be altered by other downstream LSRs or upstream LSRs.

   o  There MUST be homogeneous QoS from the root to all leaves of a
      single RD P2MP LSP.

   o  Changing the parameters for the whole tree MAY be supported, but
      the change MUST apply to the whole tree from ingress LSR to all
      egress LSRs.


4.  Backwards Compatibility

   It SHOULD be an aim of any RD RSVP-TE P2MP solution to offer as much
   backward compatibility as possible.

   Also, it is a requirement that RD P2MP TE LSPs MUST be able to
   coexist with legacy P2MP TE multicast networks.

   Also, it is a requirement that RD P2MP TE LSPs MUST be able to
   coexist with IP unicast and IP multicast networks.

Internet-Draft           RD P2MP TE Requirements            October 2010


7.  Security Considerations

   This requirements document does not define any protocol extensions
   and does not, therefore, make any changes to any security models.

   It is a requirement that any P2MP solution developed to meet some or
   all of the requirements expressed in this document MUST include
   mechanisms to enable the secure establishment and management of P2MP
   MPLS-TE LSPs.  This includes, but is not limited to:

   o  A receiver MUST be authenticated before it is allowed to establish
      P2MP LSP with source, in addition to hop-by-hop security issues
      identified by in RFC 3209 and RFC 4206.

   o  Mechanisms to ensure that the ingress LSR of a P2MP LSP is
      identified;

   o  Mechanisms to ensure that communicating signaling entities can
      verify each other's identities;

   o  Mechanisms to ensure that control plane messages are protected
      against spoofing and tampering;

   o  Mechanisms to ensure that unauthorized leaves or branches are not
      added to the P2MP LSP; and

   o  Mechanisms to protect signaling messages from snooping.

   o  Note that RD P2MP signaling mechanisms built on P2P RSVP-TE
      signaling are likely to inherit all the security techniques and
      problems associated with RSVP-TE.  These problems may be
      exacerbated in P2MP situations where security relationships may
      need to be maintained between an ingress LSR and multiple egress
      LSRs.  Such issues are similar to security issues for IP
      multicast.

   o  It is a requirement that documents offering solutions for RD P2MP
      LSPs MUST have detailed security sections.
