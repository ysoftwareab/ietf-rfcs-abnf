   Context-Aware Navigation Protocol for IP-Based Vehicular Networks
             draft-jeong-ipwave-context-aware-navigator-05

Abstract

   This document proposes a Context-Aware Navigation Protocol (CNP) for
   IP-based vehicular networks for cooperative navigation among vehicles
   in road networks.  This CNP aims at the enhancement of driving safety
   through a light-weight driving information sharing method.  The CNP
   protocol uses an IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) option to convey
   driving information such as a vehicle's position, speed,
   acceleration/deceleration, and direction, and a driver's driving
   action (e.g., braking and accelerating).

1.  Introduction

   The enhancement of driving safety is one of objectives of cooperative
   driving in vehicular networks.  Dedicated Short-Range Communications
   (DSRC) is for vehicular communications [DSRC].  IEEE has standardized
   a family standard suite of Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments
   (WAVE) [WAVE].  Also, IETF has standardized an IPv6 packet delivery
   protocol over IEEE 802.11-OCB (Outside the Context of a Basic Service
   Set) [RFC8691], which is a MAC protocol for vehicles in WAVE.

   A vehicle equipped with various sensors and a DSRC device can sense
   its surrounding environment including its neighboring vehicles, and
   share the sensed data and its mobility information (e.g., position,
   speed, acceleration/deceleration, and direction) with its neighboring
   vehicles.  This information sharing allows vehicles to assess the
   collision risk and make their maneuvers to avoid an accident in a
   prompt way.  That is, the capability of sensing, computing, and
   communication of vehicles enables them to understand the driving
   environment and situation (i.e., context), and cooperate with each
   other during their navigation.

   The driving information sharing enables context-aware navigation
   where each vehicle can display its neighboring vehicles, pedestrians,
   and obstacles in its navigation system [CASD].  With this CNP, a

   driver can make a better decision on driving to avoid an accident,
   and an autonomous vehicle can control its maneuver to escape from a
   possible fatality in advance.

   For this CNP service, this document proposes a light-weight data
   sharing protocol using a new IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) option for
   Vehicle Mobility Information, which is called Vehicle Mobility
   Information (VMI) option.  This VMI option can be included by a
   Neighbor Advertisement (NA) message in Vehicular Neighbor Discovery
   (VND) [ID-Vehicular-ND].

   There are two messages for the CNP services with the VMI option such
   as Cooperation Context Message (CCM) and Emergency Context Message
   (ECM).  The CCM is a message to deliver a vehicle's motion
   information (e.g., position, speed, acceleration/deceleration,
   direction) and a driver's driving action (e.g., braking and
   accelerating) to its neighboring vehicles for cooperative driving.
   The ECM is a message to notify a vehicle's neighboring vehicles of an
   emergency situation (e.g., an accident and dangerous situation).  The
   ECM has a higher priority than the CCM such that the ECM needs to be
   disseminated faster than the CCM in vehicular networks.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology described in [ID-IPWAVE-PS].

4.  Vehicle Mobility Information Option

   Vehicle Mobility Information (VMI) option is an IPv6 ND option to
   convey either a CCM or ECM.  Figure 1 shows the format of the VMI
   option.

         Figure 1: Vehicle Mobility Information (VMI) Option Format

  Fields:
   Type           8-bit identifier of the VMI option type as assigned
                  by the IANA: TBD

   Length         8-bit unsigned integer.  The length of the option
                  (including the Type and Length fields) is in units of
                  8 octets.  The value is 3.

   Message        8-bit identifier of the VMI message type as CCM (0)
                  and ECM (1).

   Reserved1      This field is unused.  It MUST be initialized to
                  zero by the sender and MUST be ignored by the
                  receiver.

   Reserved2      This field is unused.  It MUST be initialized to
                  zero by the sender and MUST be ignored by the
                  receiver.

   Mobility Information
                  128-bit mobility information.  It contains a vehicle's
                  motion information (e.g., position, speed,
                  acceleration/deceleration, direction) and a driver's
                  driving action (e.g., braking and accelerating) for
                  CCM.  Also, it contains a vehicle's emergency
                  information (e.g., obstacle information and accident
                  information).

   A CCM in a VMI option can be included in an NA message that a vehicle
   transmits periodically to announce its existence and routing
   information to its one-hop neighboring vehicles [ID-Vehicular-ND].

   An ECM in a VMI option can be included in an NA message that a
   vehicle transmits to immediately announce an emergency situation to
   its one-hop neighboring vehicles [ID-Vehicular-ND].

   To let the vehicles take an immediate action on an emergency
   situation, the ECM has a higher priority than the CCM.  Thus, if a
   vehicle has an ECM and a CCM to send, it SHOULD transmit the ECM
   earlier than the CCM.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document shares all the security issues of the IPv6 ND protocol.
   This document can get benefits from Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND)
   [RFC3971] in order to protect exchanged messages from possible
   security attacks.
