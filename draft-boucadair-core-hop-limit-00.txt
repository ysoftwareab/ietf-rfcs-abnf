        Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) Hop Limit Option
                   draft-boucadair-core-hop-limit-00

Abstract

   The presence of Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) proxies may
   lead to infinite forwarding loops, which is undesirable.  To prevent
   and detect such loops, this document specifies the Hop-Limit CoAP
   option.

1.  Introduction

   More and more applications are using Constrained Application Protocol
   (CoAP) [RFC7252] as a communication protocol between involved
   application agents.  For example, [I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel]
   specifies how CoAP is used as a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)
   attack signaling protocol seeking for help from DDoS mitigation
   providers.  In such contexts, a CoAP client can communicate directly
   with a server or indirectly via a proxy.

   When multiple proxies are involved, infinite forwarding loops may be
   experienced.  To prevent such loops, this document defines a new CoAP
   option, called Hop-Limit, which is inserted by on-path proxies.
   Also, the document defines a new CoAP Response Code to report loops
   together with relevant diagnostic information to ease
   troubleshooting.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   Readers should be familiar with the terms and concepts defined in
   [RFC7252].

3.  Hop-Limit Option

   Hop-Limit option (see Section 4.2) is used to detect and prevent
   infinite loops when proxies are involved.  Only one single instance
   of the option is allowed in a message.

   The length of the Hop-Limit option is 1 byte.  The value of the Hop-
   Limit option is encoded as an unsigned integer (see Section 3.2 of
   [RFC7252]).

   Each intermediate proxy involved in the handling of a CoAP message
   MUST decrement the Hop-Limit option value by 1 prior to forwarding
   upstream if this parameter exists.

   CoAP messages MUST NOT be forwarded if the Hop-Limit option is set to
   '0' after decrement.  Messages that cannot be forwarded because of
   exhausted Hop-Limit SHOULD be logged with a 5.06 (Hop Limit Reached)
   error message sent back to the CoAP peer.  It is RECOMMENDED that
   CoAP agents support means to alert administrators about loop errors
   so that appropriate actions are undertaken.

   To ease debugging and troubleshooting, the CoAP proxy which detects a
   loop SHOULD include its information (e.g., server name, server alias,
   IP address) in the diagnostic payload under the conditions detailed
   in Section 5.5.2 of [RFC7252].

   Each intermediate proxy involved in relaying a 5.06 (Hop Limit
   Reached) error message SHOULD prepend its own information in the
   diagnostic payload with a space character used as separator.  Only
   one information per proxy MUST appear in the diagnostic payload.

   The initial Hop-Limit value SHOULD be configurable.  If no initial
   value is explicitly provided, the default initial Hop-Limit value of
   16 MUST be used.  Because forwarding errors may occur if inadequate
   Hop-Limit values are used, proxies at the boundaries of an
   administrative domain MAY be instructed to rewrite the value of Hop-
   Limit carried in received messages (that is, ignore the value of Hop-
   Limit received in a message).

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  CoAP Response Code

   IANA is requested to add the following entries to the "CoAP Response
   Codes" sub-registry available at https://www.iana.org/assignments/
   core-parameters/core-parameters.xhtml#response-codes:
