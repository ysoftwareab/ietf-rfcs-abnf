1.  Introduction

   This document defines a YANG data model for ISIS routing protocol.

   The data model covers configuration of an ISIS routing protocol
   instance as well as operational states.

1.1.  Tree diagram

   A simplified graphical representation of the data model is presented
   in Section 2.

   The meaning of the symbols in these diagrams is as follows:

   o  Brackets "[" and "]" enclose list keys.

Internet-Draft                  isis-cfg                    October 2014


   o  Curly braces "{" and "}" contain names of optional features that
      make the corresponding node conditional.

   o  Abbreviations before data node names: "rw" means configuration
      (read-write), and "ro" state data (read-only).

   o  Symbols after data node names: "?" means an optional node and "*"
      denotes a "list" or "leaf-list".

   o  Parentheses enclose choice and case nodes, and case nodes are also
      marked with a colon (":").

   o  Ellipsis ("...") stands for contents of subtrees that are not
      shown.

2.  Design of the Data Model

   The ISIS YANG module is divided in two main containers "isis" that
   are augmenting the "routing-protocol" lists in ietf-routing module
   with specific ISIS parameters.

   One container contains the writable parameters, while the other
   contains the operational states.

   The figure below describe the overall structure of the isis YANG
   module:

2.1.  ISIS Configuration

   The ISIS configuration currently supports both VRF-centric and
   protocol-centric configuration.  This may be changed in future.  In a
   protocol-centric configuration, the isis configuration is applied
   within the standard-routing-instance and the instance list helps to
   reference the routing-instance where ISIS is activated.  In a VRF-
   centric configuration, the isis configuration is applied directly
   within the appropriate routing-instance where ISIS is activated.  In
   this case, the instance list will contain a single element.

   The ISIS configuration container is divided in:

   o  Global parameters.

   o  Per interface configuration (see Section 2.4).

   It would to up to extension modules to augment this model to support
   vendor specific parameters.

2.2.  Multitopology Parameters

   The topologies list is used to enable support of MT extensions for
   specific address families.

   Each topology should refer to an existing RIB.

2.3.  Per-Level Parameters

   Some parameters support per level configuration.  In this case, the
   parameter is built as a list, so different values could be used for
   each level.  The "level-all" permits to apply a value to both levels.

           +--rw priority* [level]
           |  +--rw value?   uint8
           |  +--rw level    level

   Example :

           <priority>
               <value>100</value>
               <level>level-1</level>
           </priority>
           <priority>
               <value>200</value>
               <level>level-2</level>
           </priority>

2.4.  Per-Interface Parameters

   The per-interface section of the ISIS instance describes the
   interface specific parameters.

   The interface is referenced using a string.  It would be up to the
   server device to check if the interface exists or not.  Using a
   string permits to support some specific implementations that use the
   "interface all" stanza to apply a configuration to all interfaces.

   Each interface has interface-specific parameters that may have a
   different value per level as described in previous section.  An
   interface-specific parameter always override an ISIS global parameter
   .

   Some parameters like BFD and hello-padding are defined as containers
   to permit easy extension by vendor specific modules.

2.5.  Operational State

   "isis" container provides operational states for ISIS.  This
   container is divided in multiple components:

   o  system-counters : provides statistical informations about the
      global system.

Internet-Draft                  isis-cfg                    October 2014


   o  interface-counters : provides statistical informations for each
      interface.

   o  packet-counters : provides statistical informations for each type
      of PDU.

   o  interface : provides configuration state information for each
      interface.

   o  adjacencies: provides state information about current ISIS
      adjacencies.

   o  spf-log: provides information about SPF events on the node.

   o  lsp-log: provides information about LSP events on the node
      (reception of an LSP or modification of local LSP).

   o  database: provides details on current LSDB.

   o  hostnames: provides information about system-id to hostname
      mappings.

3.  RPC Operations

   The "ietf-isis" module defines two RPC operations:

   o  clear-isis-database: reset the content of a particular ISIS
      database and restart database synchronization with the neighbors.

   o  clear-isis-adjacency: restart a particular set of ISIS
      adjacencies.

4.  Notifications

   The "ietf-isis" module introduces some notifications :

      database-overload : raised when overload condition is changed.

      lsp-too-large : raised when the system tries to propagate a too
      large PDU.

      corrupted-lsp-detected : raised when the system find that an LSP
      that was stored in memory has become corrupted.

      attempt-to-exceed-max-sequence : This notification is sent when
      the system wraps the 32-bit sequence counter of an LSP.

      id-len-mismatch : This notification is sent when we receive a PDU
      with a different value for the System ID length.

      max-area-addresses-mismatch : This notification is sent when we
      receive a PDU with a different value for the Maximum Area
      Addresses.

      own-lsp-purge : This notification is sent when the system receives
      a PDU with its own system ID and zero age.

      sequence-number-skipped : This notification is sent when the
      system receives a PDU with its own system ID and different
      contents.  The system has to reissue the LSP with a higher
      sequence number.

      authentication-type-failure : This notification is sent when the
      system receives a PDU with the wrong authentication type field.

      authentication-failure : This notification is sent when the system
      receives a PDU with the wrong authentication information.

      version-skew : This notification is sent when the system receives
      a PDU with a different protocol version number.

      area-mismatch : This notification is sent when the system receives
      a Hello PDU from an IS that does not share any area address.

      rejected-adjacency : This notification is sent when the system
      receives a Hello PDU from an IS but does not establish an
      adjacency for some reason.

      protocols-supported-mismatch : This notification is sent when the
      system receives a non pseudonode LSP that has no matching protocol
      supported.

      lsp-error-detected : This notification is sent when the system
      receives a LSP with a parse error.

      adjacency-change : This notification is sent when an ISIS
      adjacency moves to Up state or to Down state.

      lsp-received : This notification is sent when a LSP is received.

      lsp-generation : This notification is sent when a LSP is
      regenerated.

5.  Interaction with Other YANG Modules

   The "isis" configuration container augments the "/rt:routing/
   rt:routing-instance/rt:routing-protocols/routing-protocol" container
   of the ietf-routing module by defining ISIS specific parameters.

   The "isis" operational state container augments the "/rt:routing-
   state/rt:routing-instance/rt:routing-protocols/routing-protocol"
   container of the ietf-routing module by defining ISIS specific
   operational states.

   Some ISIS specific routes attributes are added to route objects of
   the ietf-routing module by augmenting "/rt:routing-
   state/rt:ribs/rt:rib/rt:routes/rt:route" and "/rt:active-
   route/rt:output/rt:route".

7.  Security Considerations

   Configuration and state data defined in this document are designed to
   be accessed via the NETCONF protocol [RFC6241].

   As ISIS is an IGP protocol (critical piece of the network), ensuring
   stability and security of the protocol is mandatory for the network
   service.

   Authors recommends to implement NETCONF access control model
   ([RFC6536]) to restrict access to all or part of the configuration to
   specific users.  Access control to RPCs is also critical as RPC
   permits to clear protocol datastructures that would definitively
   impact the network service.  This kind of RPC needs only to be used
   in specific cases by well-known experienced users.

   Authors consider that all the configuration is considered as
   sensitive/vulnerable as well as RPCs.  But security teams can decide

Internet-Draft                  isis-cfg                    October 2014


   to open some part of the configuration to less experienced users
   depending on the internal organization, for example:

   o  User FullWrite: would access to the whole data model.  This kind
      of profile may be restricted to few experienced people.

   o  User PartialWrite: would only access to configuration part within
      /isis/interfaces/interface.  So this kind of profile is restricted
      to creation/modification/deletion of interfaces.  This profile
      does not have access to RPC.

   o  User Read: would only access to state part /isis-state.

   Unauthorized access to configuration or RPC may cause high damages to
   the network service.

   The /isis-state/database may contain authentication information.  As
   presented in the description of the /isis-state/database/level-
   1/lsp/authentication/authentication-key, the authentication MUST
   never be presented in plaintext format for security reason.  Authors
   recommends the usage of MD5 to present the authentication-key.

   Some authentication-key may also be present in the /isis
   configuration.  When configuring ISIS using the NETCONF protocol,
   authors recommends the usage of secure transport of NETCONF using SSH
   ([RFC6242]).
