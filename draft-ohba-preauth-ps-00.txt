Internet-Draft  EAP Pre-authentication Problem Statement        Oct 2006


1.  Introduction

   When a mobile during an active communication session moves from one
   access network to another access network and changes its point of
   attachment it is subjected to disruption in the continuity of service
   because of the associated handover operation.  During the handover
   process, when the mobile changes its point-of-attachment in the
   network, it may change its subnet or administrative domain it is
   connected to.  A complete description of the types of handover based
   on the movement type is documented in
   [I-D.ohba-mobopts-heterogeneous-requirement].  We provide in
   Appendix A some performance requirement that are needed to support an
   interactive real-time communication such as VoIP and thus can serve
   as the guidelines for handover optimization.

   Handover often requires authorization for acquisition or modification
   of resources assigned to a mobile and the authorization needs
   interaction with a central authority in a domain.  In many cases an
   authorization procedure during a handover procedure follows an
   authentication procedure that also requires interaction with a
   central authority in a domain.  The delay introduced due to such an
   authentication and authorization procedure adds to the handover
   latency and consequently affects the ongoing multimedia sessions.
   The authentication and authorization procedure may include EAP
   authentication [RFC3748] where an AAA server may be involved in EAP
   messaging during the handover.  Depending upon the type of
   architecture, in some cases the AAA signals traverse all the way to
   the AAA server in the home domain of the mobile as well before the
   network service is granted to the mobile in the new network.  As an
   example a combination of EAP-based authentication and authorization
   may take up to 5 sec [georgiades].  Real-time communication and
   interactive traffic such as VoIP is very sensitive to the delay and
   thus cannot tolerate this amount of delay.  Hence it is necessary to
   reduce the delay due to authentication, authorization and AAA related
   key transfer.  Thus it is desirable that interactions between the
   mobile and AAA servers must be avoided or be reduced during the
   handover.

   This draft discusses EAP pre-authentication problems in details where
   EAP pre-authentication is defined as the utilization of EAP to pre-
   establish EAP keying material on an authenticator prior to arrival of
   the peer at the access network managed by that authenticator.

2.  Problem Statement

   Basic mechanism of handover is a two step procedure involving i)
   network selection procedure to determine the appropriate candidate
   network point of attachment and ii) handover or setting up of L2 and
   L3 connectivity to the target network point of attachment.
   Currently, security mechanisms for authentication and authorization
   is performed as part of the second step directly with the target
   network.  Experimental studies with network handovers indicate that
   the latency introduced due to the security mechanisms is not
   acceptable for real time communications.  For example, in basic IEEE
   802.11b based wireless networks, the security mechanism involves
   performing a new IEEE 802.1x message exchange with the authenticator
   in the target AP to initiate an EAP exchange to the authentication
   server.  Following a successful authentication, a four-way handshake
   with the wireless station derives a new set of the session keys for
   use in data communications.  This mechanism is same as the initial
   setup to the AP with no particular optimizations for the handover
   scenario.  The handover latency component introduced by this security
   mechanism has proven to be larger than what is acceptable.  Hence,
   improvement in the handover latency performance due to security
   procedures is a necessary objective.

   There is relevant work undertaken by various standards organizations.
   But these efforts are scoped to a specific access technology.  IEEE
   802.11f has defined transfer of Security context from one AP to
   another.  IEEE 802.11i defines a pre-authentication mechanism for use
   in 802.11 variant wireless networks.  This mechanism allows mobile
   devices to make EAP pre-authentication by establishing link-layer
   security associations with one or more target authenticators by
   sending 802.1X messages directly to the target authenticators bridged
   via the serving authenticator.  Presently, IEEE 802.11r WG has been
   working to define Fast BSS transition mechanisms involving a
   definition of key management hierarchy and mechanisms for link-layer
   pre-authentication and setup of session keys before the re-
   association to the target AP.  These mechanisms, as indicated before,
   are defined for IEEE 802.11 technologies and are only applicable
   within a certain access domain and fall short when it comes to inter-
   access technology handovers.  They also require L2 (e.g., Ethernet)
   connectivity for transfer of encapsulated signaling to the target AP.
   Especially, a solution is needed for 802.11i pre-authentication to
   work across multiple VLANs where the serving and target APs are
   connected to a large number of VLANs and stations can transit from
   one VLAN to another.

   As various flavors of wireless technologies are increasingly
   available, there is a growing demand for seamless inter-access
   technology mobility and handovers.  This is particularly beneficial

Internet-Draft  EAP Pre-authentication Problem Statement        Oct 2006


   in the presence of high bandwidth wireless technologies (e.g., IEEE
   802.11a/b/g) with only hotspot like coverages while the overlay
   licensed wireless/cellular coverages are expensive and relatively
   lower bandwidth.  There is a strong motivation to allow seamless
   inter-technology handovers for all kinds of data communications.
   Hence, the security optimization mechanisms for better handover
   performance must be looked at from the IP level so as to make it a
   common method over different access technologies.

   Solutions for mobility security optimizations can be largely seen as
   security context transfer, handover keying or EAP pre-authentication.
   Security context transfer involves transfer of reusable key context
   in the new point of attachment.  However, the recent AAA key
   management requirement [I-D.housley-aaa-key-mgmt] does not recommend
   context transfer of reusable key context because of domino effect in
   which a compromise of an authenticator will lead to a compromise of
   another authenticator.  Nakhjiri et al [I-D.nakhjiri-aaa-hokey-ps]
   discusses handover keying.  Handover keying uses an existing EAP-
   generated key for deriving a key to be used for a target
   authenticator in order to reduce the handover delay, which eliminates
   the need for running EAP for each inter-authenticator handover.  On
   the other hand, there are certain cases where an EAP-generated key
   does not exist or is not usable for handover keying at the time of
   handover and an EAP run is not avoidable to generate a key for the
   target authenticator.  One case is an inter-domain handover without
   any trust relationship between domains.  Another case is a handover
   to an existing technology that does not support handover keying.

   EAP pre-authentication discussed in this document is mainly to deal
   with an environment where the serving and target authenticators are
   in different subnets or of different link-layer technologies.  Such
   use of EAP pre-authentication would enable the mobile device to
   authenticate and setup keys prior to connecting to the target
   authenticator.  This framework has general applicability to various
   deployment scenarios.  Note that EAP pre-authentication problem for
   intra-technology intra-subnet handover could be solved by each link-
   layer and is thus out of the scope of this document while a general
   solution developed at IETF can be used for intra-technology and
   intra-subnet scenarios as well.

   In EAP pre-authentication, AAA authentication and authorization for a
   target authenticator is performed while application sessions are in
   progress via the serving network.  The goal of EAP pre-authentication
   is to avoid AAA signaling for EAP when or soon after the device
   moves.  There are several AAA issues related to EAP pre-
   authentication.  The pre-authentication AAA issues are described in
   another document [I-D.nakhjiri-preauth-aaa-req].

   authentication.

           Figure 1: EAP Pre-authentication Functional Elements

   A mobile node is attached to the serving access network.  Before the
   mobile node performs handover from the serving access network to a
   target access network, it performs EAP pre-authentication with a
   target authenticator, an authenticator in the target access network,
   via the serving access network.  The mobile node may perform EAP pre-
   authentication with one or more target authenticators.  It is assumed
   that each authenticator has an IP address when authenticators are on
   different IP links.  It is assumed that there is at least one target
   authenticator in each target access network while the serving access
   network may or may not have a serving authenticator.  The serving and
   target access networks may use different link-layer technologies.

   Each authenticator has the functionality of EAP authenticator which
   is either standalone EAP authenticator or pass-through EAP
   authenticator.  When an authenticator acts as a standalone EAP
   authenticator, it also has the functionality of EAP server.  On the
   other hand, when an authenticator acts as a pass-through EAP
   authenticator, it communicates with EAP server typically implemented
   on a AAA server using a AAA protocol such as RADIUS and Diameter.

   If the target authenticator is of an existing link-layer technology
   that uses an MSK (Master Session Key) [I-D.ietf-eap-keying] for
   generating lower-layer ciphering keys, EAP pre-authentication is used
   for proactively generating the MSK for the target authenticator.

3.  Usage Scenarios

   There are two scenarios on how EAP pre-authentication signaling can
   happen among a mobile node, a serving authenticator, a target
   authenticator and a AAA server, depending on how the serving
   authenticator is involved in the EAP pre-authentication signaling.

3.1.  Direct Pre-authentication

   Direct pre-authentication signaling is shown in Figure 2.

   Mobile               Serving                   Target               AAA
    Node             Authenticator             Authenticator          Server

     |                     |                        |                   |
     |            MN-TA Signaling (L2 or L3)        |       AAA         |
     |<--------------------+----------------------->|<----------------->|
     |                     |                        |                   |
     |                     |                        |                   |

                    Figure 2: Direct Pre-authentication

   In this type of pre-authentication, EAP pre-authentication signaling
   is transparent to the serving authenticator or there may be no
   serving authenticator at all in the serving access network.

   [I-D.ietf-pana-preauth] is identified as a protocol to realize direct
   pre-authentication.

3.2.  Indirect Pre-authentication

   Indirect pre-authentication signaling is shown in Figure 3.

     |                     |                        |                   |
     |                     |                        |                   |
     |   MN-SA Signaling   |   SA-TA Signaling      |       AAA         |
     |    (L2 or L3)       |        (L3)            |                   |
     |<------------------->|<---------------------->|<----------------->|
     |                     |                        |                   |
     |                     |                        |                   |

                   Figure 3: Indirect Pre-authentication

   With indirect pre-authentication, the serving authenticator is

   involved in EAP pre-authentication signaling.  Indirect pre-
   authentication is needed if IP communication is not allowed between
   the target authenticator and unauthorized nodes for security reasons.

   Indirect pre-authentication signaling is spliced into mobile node to
   serving authenticator signaling (MN-SA signaling) and serving
   authenticator to target authenticator signaling (SA-TA signaling).

   SA-TA signaling is performed over L3.

   MN-SA signaling is performed over L2 or L3.

   The role of the serving authenticator in indirect pre-authentication
   is to bridge EAP pre-authentication signaling between the mobile node
   and the target authenticator and not to act as an EAP authenticator,
   while it acts as an EAP authenticator for normal authentication
   signaling.  This is illustrated in Figure 4.

4.  Security Considerations

   Since pre-authentication described in this document needs to work
   across multiple authenticators, any solution for this problem needs
   considerations on the following security threats.

   First, a possible resource consumption denial of service attack where
   an attacker that is not on the same IP link as the mobile node or the
   target authenticator may send unprotected pre-authentication messages
   to the mobile node or the target authenticator to let the legitimate
   mobile node and target authenticator spend their computational and
   bandwidth resources.

   Second, consideration for the Channel Binding problem described in
   [I-D.ietf-eap-keying] is needed as lack of Channel Binding may enable
   an authenticator to impersonate another authenticator or communicate
   incorrect information via out-of-band mechanisms (such as via a AAA
   or lower layer protocol) [RFC3748].  It should be noted that it would
   be easier to launch such an impersonation attack for pre-
   authentication than normal authentication because an attacker does
   not need to be physically on the same link as the legitimate peer to
   send a pre-authentication trigger to the peer.  A simple solution
   would be to let the peer always initiate EAP pre-authentication and
   not allow EAP pre-authentication initiation from authenticator side.

Appendix A.  Performance Requirements

   In order to provide the desirable quality of service for interactive
   VoIP and streaming traffic during handoff, one needs to limit the
   value of end-to-end delay, jitter and packet loss to a certain
   threshold level.  ITU-T and ITU-R standards define the acceptable
   values for these parameters.  For example for one-way delay, ITU-T
   G.114 [ITU] recommends 150 ms as the upper limit for most of the
   applications, and 400 ms as generally unacceptable delay.  One way
   delay tolerance for video conferencing is in the range of 200 to 300
   ms.  Also if an out-of-order packet is received after a certain
   threshold, it is considered lost.  The performance requirement will
   vary based on the type of application and its characteristics such as
   delay tolerance and loss tolerance limit.  Interactive traffic such
   as VoIP and streaming traffic will have different tolerance for delay
   and packet loss.  For example, according to ETSI TR 101 [ETSI] a
   normal voice conversation can tolerate up to 2% packet loss.
   Similarly there are other factors such as Transmission Rating Factor
   (R) standardized within ITU-T G.107, End to End delay (one way mouth-
   to-ear) and call blocking ratio that determine the QoS metrics.  An R
   value of 50 is considered to be poor and a value of 90 can be
   considered as the best that provides most user satisfaction.  As an
   example, a class B QoS which is equivalent to cellular telephony has
   a R factor that is greater than 70, E2E delay of less than 150 ms and
   call blocking ratio which is less than or equal to 0.15.  Class A QoS
   that is the highest and is equivalent to fixed phone quality has an R
   value that is more than 80 and an end-to-end delay that is less than
   100 ms.  Similarly, 3GPP TS23.107 defines 4 application classes:
   conversational, streaming, interactive and background each with
   different set of end-to-end delay and QoS requirement.  The streaming
   class has the tolerable packet (SDU) error rates ranging from 0.1 to
   0.00001 and the transfer delay of less than 300ms.  In short, the
   delay and packet loss tolerance value will depend upon the type of
   application and different standard bodies and vendors provide
   different specification for each type of application and thus any
   optimized handoff mechanism will need to take these values into
   consideration.

   It is desirable to support a heterogeneous handover that is agnostic
   to link-layer technologies in an optimized and secure fashion without
   incurring unreasonable complexity while providing seamless handover
   experience to the user.  As a mobile goes through a handover process,
   it is subjected to handover delay because of the rebinding of
   properties at several layers of the protocol stack, such as layer 2,
   layer 3 and application layer.  There are several common properties
   that contribute to the re-establishment or modification of these
   layers during handover.  These properties can mostly be attributed to
   things such as access characteristics (e.g., bandwidth, channel

   characteristics, channel scan, access point association), access
   mechanism (e.g., CDMA, CSMA/CA, TDMA), configuration of layer 3
   parameters such as IP address acquisition, re-authentication, re-
   authorization, rebinding of security association at all layers,
   binding update etc.  Although each of the components during the
   handover process that contributes to the handover delay needs to be
   optimized, we focus our discussion on optimizing the delay due to
   authentication and authorization.
