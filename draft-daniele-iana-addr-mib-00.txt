Status of this Memo

   This document is an Internet-Draft.  Internet-Drafts are working
   documents of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), its
   areas, and its working groups.  Note that other groups may also
   distribute working documents as Internet-Drafts.

   Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six
   months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other
   documents at any time.  It is inappropriate to use Internet-
   Drafts as reference material or to cite them other than as
   "work in progress."

1.  Abstract

   This document contains an initial version of a MIB module for
   commonly used network addressing information. It defines a registry
   for identifiers that identify protocols and a set of textual
   conventions for representing addresses. This document also
   establishes IANA as the maintainer of this registry.

2.  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2271 [1].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        RFC 1155 [2], RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The second version,
        called SMIv2, is described in RFC 1902 [5], RFC 1903 [6] and RFC
        1904 [7].

    o   Message protocols for transferring management information. The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP message
        protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is
        called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC 1906 [10].
        The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and
        described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2272 [11] and RFC 2274 [12].

    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol operations
        and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [13].

    o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2273 [14] and
        the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2275
        [15].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

3.  Overview

   This MIB module contains definitions for commonly used network 
   addressing information.  In particular, it defines a registry of 
   OBJECT-IDENTIFIERs for protocols, and a set of textual conventions 
   for representing endpoints.  The former are intended to be widely 
   used as values for OBJECT-TYPEs whose syntax is TDomain, the latter
   as values for OBJECT-TYPEs whose syntax is TAddress. 

   The purpose of this memo is to provide a single, well-known repository
   for address-related information.  Further, this module establishes IANA 
   as the maintainer of these definitions (see section 6).

   Without such a repository, each MIB module requiring addressing constructs 
   is forced to either define its own, or attempt to locate and include similar
   definitions from other modules.  The advantages of a repository are 

   a) there is a single set of definitions
   b) all MIB developers know what to include, and where to look
   c) multiple definitions of the same information is avoided
   d) the definitions are independant and widely useable, not tied 
      to a particular protocol, MIB module, or enterprise
   e) this module can be updated independently, and hence much more
      rapidly, than if the information is defined in broader RFCs
      on the standards-track (for example, [RFC1906])

4.   Transport Domains and Addresses
   
   The TDomain and TAddress textual conventions are defined in [RFC1903],
   and are intended to be used in MIB modules to represent transport
   domains and addresses.  

   Actual values for OBJECT-TYPEs with these syntaxes are currently defined
   in [RFC1906] and various other (enterprise-specific) modules.
   The transport domains defined in [RFC1906] all contain "snmp" as the prefix
   in their name, are all assigned under `snmpDomains' (from [RFC1902]). 
   There has been some confusion as to whether these defintions are 
   appropriate for designating transport endpoints for non-SNMP traffic.
   These definitions are also now incomplete, new transport addresses are 
   needed currently to support (at least) IPv6, TCP, and Unix-domain sockets.

   This module defines a new set of generic transport domains and addresses.
   All assignments are made under a new branch; (TBD), to be administered
   by IANA.

5.  Impact on Transport Mappings

   This module does NOT define the transport mappings for any particular
   protocol.  Rather, it defines a set of common identifiers and textual
   conventions that are intended to be used within various transport mappings
   documents.

   (Inclusion within transport mappings is just one possible use of
    these generic definitions.)

6.  IANA Considerations

   It is intended that IANA will maintain this MIB module.

   Following the policies outlined in [IANA-CONSIDERATIONS],
   additions to this module MUST be reviewed by a Designated Expert.

8.  Open Issues

   1) Can the TDomain and TAddress textual conventions defined
      in RFC 1903 be used to represent "generic" transport information,
      used by applications other than just SNMP?  

   Proposal: While their definitions use detailed examples
   that are SNMP-specific, they may be used more widely.
   (An update to RFC1903 should modify their descriptions accordingly.)

   2) Can the IANA-ADDRESS-MIB also be used for non-transport
      addresses?  For example, can a TAddress be used to represent
      just a network-layer address?

   Proposal:  Yes, it can be used for arbitrary address domains. We
   should clarify the wordings of the TDomain and TAddress
   definition in the successor of RFC 1903 to make that clear. This
   needs to be discussed with the work currently going on to bring
   RFC 1903 to full standard status.

   3) Do we need an OID where IANA controlled MIB modules such as this
     module can be registered?  (Another such module might be 
     the IANA-LANGUAGE-MIB from the DISMAN WG.)

     Proposal: Yes.  One possible node is

	     iana OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { internet 7 }

     Whatever assignment is made, it should optimally be reflected in the 
     revision of RFC 1902 which is currently being worked on.

   4) Should there be separate OID branches for network (and below) addresses,
      network+transport addresses, and applications?
      Or is some other hierarchy more useful?

      Proposal: No.

   5) If this memo prospers, what happens to the values defined in RFC1906?

   Many of the definitions in this module are taken directly from [RFC1906].

11.  Security Considerations

   This MIB module defines assigned values for commonly used addressing
   domains, and a set of textual conventions.  It does not define any
   MIB objects that actually contain management information.

   As such, there are no security considerations for this module.
