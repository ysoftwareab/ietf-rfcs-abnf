1. Introduction 

   The iSAC codec is an adaptive wideband speech and audio codec that 
   operates with very short delay, making it suitable for high quality 
   real time communication.  It is specially designed to deliver 
   wideband speech quality in both low and medium bit rate applications.  
   It also handles non-speech audio, such as music and background noise, 
   exceptionally well [5]. 

   The iSAC codec compresses speech frames of 16 kHz, 16-bit sampled 
   input speech, each frame containing 30 or 60 ms of speech.  

   The iSAC codec operates at transmission rates from about 10 kbps to 
   about 32 kbps.  Even at dial-up modem data rates (including IP, UDP, 
   and RTP overhead) iSAC delivers better than PSTN sound quality by 
   automatically adjusting transmission rates to give the best possible 
   listening experience over the available bandwidth. 

   The main characteristics can be summarized as follows: 

   o  Wideband, 16 kHz, speech and audio codec  

   o  Variable bit rate, which depends on the input signal 

   o  Adaptive rate with two modes: channel-adaptive or channel-
      independent mode 

   o  Bit rate range from around 10 kbps to 32 kbps 

   o  Operates on 30 or 60 msec of speech frames

2. RTP Payload Format 

   The iSAC codec uses 30 or 60 ms frames and a sampling rate clock of 
   16 kHz, so the RTP timestamp MUST be in units of 1/16000 of a second. 

   The RTP payload for iSAC has the format shown in Figure 1.  No   
   additional header fields specific to this payload format are   
   required.  For RTP based transportation of iSAC encoded audio, the   
   standard RTP header [2] is followed by one payload data block.

2.1. iSAC Payload 

   The iSAC payload is padded to whole octets, and has a variable length 
   depending on the input source signal, frame length, and target bit 
   rate.  

   The number of octets used to describe one frame of 30 ms speech 
   typically varies from around 50 to around 120 octets.  For the case 
   of 60 ms frames, the number of octets varies from around 100 to 
   around 240 octets.  The absolute maximum allowed payload length is 
   600 octets. 

   In channel-adaptive mode, the frame length can change at any time 
   during a session.  The frame length is signaled in band. 

   The sensitivity to bit errors is equal for all bits in the payload. 

2.2. Multiple iSAC frames in an RTP packet 

   More than one iSAC frame MUST NOT be included in an RTP packet by a 
   sender. 

   Further, frames MUST NOT be split between RTP packets.

3. IANA Considerations 

   This document defines the iSAC media type. 

3.1. Media Type registration of iSAC  

   Media type name: audio 

   Media subtype: iSAC 

   Required parameters: None 

   Optional parameters: None 

   Encoding considerations:  

      This media format is framed and binary. 

   Security considerations:  

      See section 6.  

   Interoperability considerations: None 

   Published specification: 

   Applications which use this media type: 

      This media type is suitable for use in numerous applications 
      needing to transport encoded voice or other audio.  Some examples 
      include Voice over IP, Streaming Media, Voice Messaging, and 
      Conferencing. 

   Additional information: None 

   Intended usage: COMMON 

   Other Information/General Comment: 

      iSAC is a proprietary speech and audio codec owned by Global IP 
      Solutions.  The codec operates on 30 or 60 ms speech frames at a 
      sampling rate clock of 16 kHz.

   Restrictions on usage: 

      This media type depends on RTP framing, and hence is only defined 
      for transfer via RTP [2].  Transport within other framing 
      protocols is not defined at this time.

4. Mapping to SDP Parameters 

   The information carried in the media type specification has a 
   specific mapping to fields in the Session Description Protocol (SDP) 
   [4], which is commonly used to describe RTP sessions.  When SDP is 
   used to specify sessions employing the iSAC codec, the mapping is as 
   follows: 

   o  The media type ("audio") goes in SDP "m=" as the media name. 

   o  The media subtype (payload format name) goes in SDP "a=rtpmap" as      
      the encoding name. 

   When conveying information by SDP, the encoding name SHALL be "iSAC"   
   (the same as the media subtype). 

   An example of the media representation in SDP for describing iSAC 
   might be: 

      m=audio 49120 RTP/AVP 104 
      a=rtpmap: 104 iSAC/16000 

   Note that the payload format (encoding) names are commonly shown in   
   upper case.  Media subtypes are commonly shown in lower case.  These   
   names are case-insensitive in both places.  Similarly, parameter   
   names are case-insensitive both in media types and in the default   
   mapping to the SDP a=fmtp attribute.

5. Offer/Answer Considerations 

   No special considerations must be given for the use of iSAC within 
   the offer/answer model.

6. Security Considerations 

   RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification 
   are subject to the general security considerations discussed in RFC 
   3550 [2]. 

   As this format transports encoded speech, the main security issues 
   include confidentiality and authentication of the speech itself.  The 
   payload format itself does not have any built-in security mechanisms.  
   External mechanisms, such as SRTP [3], MAY be used.
