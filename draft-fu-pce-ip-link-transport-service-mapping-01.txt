         A YANG Model for IP Link and Transport Service Mapping
           draft-fu-pce-ip-link-transport-service-mapping-01

Abstract

   IP+optical is a cross-layer collaboration technology for unified
   management of IP and optical networks.  Based on framework proposed
   in [ACTN-FWK][I-D.ietf-teas-actn-framework], this draft presents
   specific information about the IP+optical solution: hierarchical
   controllers + disabled GMPLS UNIs.  This solution does not involve
   UNI tunnel objects.  Therefore, the mapping between IP links and
   transport services is key point of this solution.  This draft
   provides a YANG model for the RESTCONF/NETCONF protocol.  This YANG
   module defines NBIs for the IP+optical super controller.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  IP+optical solution

   IP+optical is a cross-layer collaboration technology for unified
   management of IP and optical networks.  IP+optical adopts the C/S
   architecture, where the IP network is the client-layer network and
   the optical network is the server-layer network.  The mapping between
   IP-layer IP links and transport services is the key ability of an
   IP+optical network.  Through the mapping, the services of IP layers
   and those of transport layers can be associated to implement use
   cases of IP+optical scenarios.

   IP+optical use cases include multi-layer topology visualization,
   automated network deployment, multi-layer automated service
   deployment, multi-layer protection and restoration, multi-layer
   optimization, and multi-layer maintenance window.

   Based on framework proposed in [ACTN-
   FWK][I-D.ietf-teas-actn-framework], this draft presents specific
   information about the IP+optical solution: hierarchical controllers +
   disabled GMPLS UNIs.  This solution does not involve UNI tunnel
   objects.  Therefore, the mapping between IP links and transport
   services is key point of this solution.

   The IP+optical solution implements cross-layer service provisioning
   through cross-layer link and association of multi-layer topologies.
   After service provisioning, this solution is required to present
   multi-layer service views for users to learn service status.  In
   addition, the association management function needs to be available
   during fault demarcation and locating and cross-layer protection and
   restoration.  To meet these demands, a service mapping needs to be
   maintained between IP-layer IP links and optical-layer transport
   services.

   In real-world situations, IP+optical super controllers can be
   separately deployed or combined with other controllers.  For example,
   in IP+optical single-domain scenarios, an IP+optical super controller

   can be combined with an IP domain controller.  In IP multi-domain and
   optical multi-domain scenarios, you can deploy one separate IP super
   controller and one separate optical super controller.  The two super
   controllers communicate through RESTConf interfaces and use the
   IP+VNT algorithm to complete E2E cross-layer path calculation.  In
   such multi-domain scenarios, you can also deploy only one IP+optical
   super controller and use a unified cross-layer algorithm in the
   controller to complete E2E cross-layer path calculation.

1.2.  Unified cross-layer algorithm

   In this model, inter-layer path computation is performed by a single
   PCE of a Unified controller that has topology visibility into all
   layers.  Such a PCE is called a multi-layer PCE.  In Figure 2, the
   network is comprised of two layers.  NEs H1, H2,H3, and H4 belong to
   the higher layer, and NEs H2, H3, L1, and L2 belong to the lower
   layer.  The PCE is a multi-layer PCE that has visibility into both
   layers.  It can perform end-to-end path computation across layers
   (single PCE path computation).  For instance, it can compute an
   optimal path H1-H2-L1-L2-H3-H4.  Of course, more complex cooperation
   may be required if an optimal end-to-end path is desired.

1.3.  IP+VNT algorithm

   In this model, there is at least one PCE of controller per layer, and
   each PCE of controller has topology visibility restricted to its own
   layer.  Some providers may want to keep the layer boundaries due to
   factors such as organizational and/or service management issues.  The
   choice for multiple PCE computation instead of single PCE computation
   may also be driven by scalability considerations, as in this mode a
   PCE only needs to maintain topology information for one layer
   (resulting in a size reduction for the Traffic Engineering Database
   (TED)).  Figure 3 shows multiple PCE inter-layer computation with
   inter-PCE communication.  There is one PCE in each layer.  The PCEs
   from each layer collaborate to compute an end-to-end path across
   layers.  An IP-PCE of IP-domain controller uses IP topology and VNT
   topology information to perform path calculation at the higher layer.
   If a VNT link is selected, the IP-domain controller collaborates with
   the optical-domain controller for path calculation.  The optical-PCE
   of optical-domain controller then uses cross-layer topology and
   optical topology information to calculate an underlying VNT path.A
   simple example of cooperation between the PCEs could be as follows:

   o  IP controller sends a request to IP-PCE for a path H1-H4 with ip
      topo and VNT topo.

   o  IP-PCE selects VNT link as the entry point and exit point to the
      lower layer.

   o  IP-PCE of IP controller requests a path both ends of VNT link from
      Optical-PCE of optical controller.

   o  Optical-PCE returns H2-L1-L2-H3 to IP-PCE.

   o  IP-PCE is now able to compute the full path (H1-H2-L1-L2-H3-H4)
