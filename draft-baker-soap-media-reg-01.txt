Abstract

   This document defines the "application/soap+xml" media type which can
   be used to describe SOAP 1.2 messages serialized as XML.

1. Introduction

   SOAP version 1.2 (SOAP) is a lightweight protocol intended for
   exchange of structured information between peers in a decentralized,
   distributed environment. It defines an extensible messaging framework
   that contains a message construct based on XML technologies that can
   be exchanged over a variety of underlying protocols.

   This specification defines the media type "application/soap+xml"
   which can be used to identify SOAP messages serialized with XML 1.0,
   carried in MIME or MIME like protocols that support the concept of
   media types for which a SOAP binding has been defined.

2. Registration

   MIME media type name:      application
   MIME subtype name:         soap+xml
   Required parameters:       none
   Optional parameters:

     charset
       This parameter has identical semantics to the charset parameter
       of the "application/xml" media type as specified in [XMLMIME].

     action
       See Section 5 of this document.

  Encoding considerations:
     Identical to those of "application/xml" as described in [XMLMIME],
     Section 3.2, as applied to the SOAP envelope infoset.

  Security considerations:
     See Section 3 of this document.

  Interoperability considerations:
     See Section 4 of this document.

  Published specification:
     See [SOAP12P1] and [SOAP12P2].

  Applications which use this media type:
     No known applications currently use this media type.

  Additional information:

     File extension:
       SOAP messages are not required or expected to be stored as
       files.

     Fragment identifiers:
       Identical to that of "application/xml" as described in [XMLMIME],
       Section 5.

     Base URI:
       As specified in RFC 3023, Section 6.  Also see [SOAP12P1],
       Section 6.

     Macintosh File Type code: TEXT

   Person & email address to contact for further information:

   Intended usage: COMMON

   Author/Change controller:
     The SOAP 1.2 specification set is a work product of the World Wide
     Web Consortium's XML Protocol Working Group.  The W3C has change
     control over these specifications.

3. Security considerations

  Because SOAP can carry application defined data whose semantics is
  independent from that of any MIME wrapper (or context within which the
  MIME wrapper is used), one should not expect to be able to understand
  the semantics of the SOAP message based on the semantics of the MIME
  wrapper alone.  Therefore, whenever using the application/soap+xml
  media type, it is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that the security implications
  of the context within which the SOAP message is used is fully
  understood. The security implications are likely to involve both the
  specific SOAP binding to an underlying protocol as well as the
  application-defined semantics of the data carried in the SOAP message
  (though one must be careful when doing this, as discussed in
  [SOAP12P1], Section 7.3.1).

  Also, see the full SOAP 1.2 Part 1 [SOAP12P1], Section 7.

  In addition, as this media type uses the "+xml" convention, it shares
  the same security considerations as described in [XMLMIME], Section
  10.

4. Interoperability considerations

  There are no known interoperability issues.

5. The "action" parameter

  This optional parameter can be used to specify the URI that identifies
  the intent of the message.  In SOAP 1.2, it serves a similar purpose
  as the SOAPAction HTTP header did in SOAP 1.1.  Namely, its value
  identifies the intent of the message.

  The value of the action parameter is an absolute URI-reference as
  defined by RFC 2396 [URI].  SOAP places no restrictions on the
  specificity of the URI or that it is resolvable.
  
  Although the purpose of the action parameter is to indicate the intent
  of the SOAP message there is no mechanism for automatically computing
  the value based on the SOAP envelope. In other words, the value has to
  be determined out of band.
  
  It is recommended that the same value be used to identify sets of
  message types that are logically connected in some manner, for example
  part of the same "service". It is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that the URI be
  globally unique and stable over time.
 
  The presence and content of the action parameter MAY be used by
  servers such as firewalls to appropriately filter SOAP messages and it
  may be used by servers to facilitate dispatching of SOAP messages to
  internal message handlers etc. It SHOULD NOT be used as an insecure
  form of access authorization.

  Use of the action parameter is OPTIONAL. SOAP Receivers MAY use it as
  a hint to optimize processing, but SHOULD NOT require its presence in
  order to operate.
