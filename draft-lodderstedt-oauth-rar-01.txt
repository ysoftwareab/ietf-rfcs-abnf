1.  Introduction

   [RFC6749] defines the parameter "scope" that allows OAuth clients to
   specify the expected scope, i.e. the permission, of an access token.
   This mechanism is sufficient to implement static scenarios and course
   grain authorization requests, such as "give me read access to the
   resource owner's profile" but it's not sufficient to specify fine
   grained authorization requirements, such as "please let me make a
   payment with the amount of 45 Euros" or "please give me read access
   to folder A and write access to file X".

   This draft introduces a new parameter "authorization_details" that
   allows clients to specify their fine grained authorization
   requirements using the expressiveness of JSON data structures.

   For example, a request for payment authorization can use a JSON
   object like this:

   {
      "instructedAmount":{
         "currency":"EUR",
         "amount":"123.50"
      },
      "debtorAccount":{
         "iban":"DE40100100103307118608"
      },
      "creditorName":"Merchant123",
      "creditorAccount":{
         "iban":"DE02100100109307118603"
      },
      "remittanceInformationUnstructured":"Ref Number Merchant"
   }

   For a comprehensive discussion of the challenges arising from new use
   cases in the open banking and eletronic signing spaces see
   [transaction-authorization].

1.1.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This specification uses the terms "access token", "refresh token",
   "authorization server", "resource server", "authorization endpoint",
   "authorization request", "authorization response", "token endpoint",
   "grant type", "access token request", "access token response", and
   "client" defined by The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework [RFC6749].

2.  Request parameter "authorization_details"

   The request parameter "authorization_details" contains a JSON object.
   This JSON object is composed of one or more JSON objects on the
   second level, each of them containing the data to specify the
   authorization requirements for a certain type of resource.  The type
   of resource or access requirement is determined by the name of the
   JSON object.

   This example shows the specification of authorization details for a
   payment initiation transaction:

   {
      "payment":{
         "instructedAmount":{
            "currency":"EUR",
            "amount":"123.50"
         },
         "debtorAccount":{
            "iban":"DE40100100103307118608"
         },
         "creditorName":"Merchant123",
         "creditorAccount":{
            "iban":"DE02100100109307118603"
         },
         "remittanceInformationUnstructured":"Ref Number Merchant"
      }
   }

   This example shows a combined request asking for access to account
   information and allowance to initiate a payment:

   {
      "accounts":{
         "access":{
            "accounts":[

            ],
            "balances":[

            ],
            "transactions":[

            ]
         }
      },
      "payment":{
         "instructedAmount":{
            "currency":"EUR",
            "amount":"123.50"
         },
         "debtorAccount":{
            "iban":"DE40100100103307118608"
         },
         "creditorName":"Merchant123",
         "creditorAccount":{
            "iban":"DE02100100109307118603"
         },
         "remittanceInformationUnstructured":"Ref Number Merchant"
      }
   }

   The named JSON objects "account" and "payment" represent the
   different authorization data to be used by the AS to ask for consent
   and MUST subsequently also be made available to the respective RSs.

2.1.  Authorization data elements types

   It is assumed that the structure of each of the authorization data
   elements is tailored to the needs of a certain application, API, or
   resource type.  For example, the example structures shown above are
   based on certain kinds of APIs that can be found in the Open Banking
   space.

   This draft therefore only defines the "authorization_details" element
   (the container) and a minimal set of requirements regarding the
   structure of the contained authorization data elements.

   Note: different applications MUST ensure that their authorization
   data types do not collide.  This is either achieved by using a

   namespace under the control of the entity defining the type name or
   by registering the type with the new "OAuth Authorization Data Type
   Registry" (see Section 9).

   The following example shows how an implementation could utilize the
   namespace "https://scheme.examples.org/" to ensure collision
   resistent element names.

   {
      "https://scheme.examples.org/files":{
         "permissions":[
            {
               "path":"/myfiles/A",
               "access":[
                  "read"
               ]
            }
         ]
      }
   }

2.2.  Multiple instances of the same authorization data type

   It's possible that the client asks for different kinds of access to
   different resources of the same type.  There are two ways to cope
   with such a situation.

   For some applications, e.g. file access, it might be reasonable to
   build a way to allocated authorization data to certain resources into
   the application specific JSON structure.

   Here is an example:

Internet-Draft                  oauth-rar                 September 2019


   {
      "https://scheme.examples.org/files":{
         "permissions":[
            {
               "path":"/myfiles/A",
               "access":[
                  "read"
               ]
            },
            {
               "path":"/myfiles/A/X",
               "access":[
                  "read",
                  "write"
               ]
            }
         ]
      }
   }

   Alternatively, a client MAY specify multiple instances of the same
   authorization data element type and distinguish those elements by
   adding a suffix "$"+"<instancename>".  The following shows
   authorization details for requesting access to different folder on
   different IMAP servers (assuming the resource owner has access to
   both of them):

   {
      "https://scheme.examples.org/imap":{
         "server":"imap.example.com",
         "mailbox":"/users/<current>",
         "access":[
            "read",
            "write"
         ]
      },
      "https://scheme.examples.org/imap$2":{
         "server":"imap.example.org",
         "mailbox":"/users/shared/folder3",
         "access":[
            "read"
         ]
      }
   }

2.3.  Using "authorization_details"

   The request parameter can be used anywhere where the "scope"
   parameter is used, examples include:

   o  Authorization requests as specified in [RFC6749],

   o  Request objects as specified in [I-D.ietf-oauth-jwsreq],

   o  Device Authorization Request as specified in [RFC8628]

   Parameter encoding is determined by the respective context.

   In the context of an authorization request according to [RFC6749],
   the parameter is encoded using the "application/x-www-form-
   urlencoded" format as shown in the following example (JSON string
   trimmed for brevity):

   GET /authorize?response_type=code&client_id=s6BhdRkqt3
       &state=af0ifjsldkj
       &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient%2Eexample%2Ecom%2Fcb
       &code_challenge_method=S256,
       &code_challenge=5c305578f8f19b2dcdb6c3c955c0a...97e43917cd,
       &authorization_details=%7B%22payment%22%3A%7B%22instructedAmount
       %22%3A%7B%22currency%22%3A%22EUR%22%2C%22amount%22%3A%22123.50%2

       rchant%22%7D%7D HTTP/1.1
   Host: server.example.com

   In the context of a request object, "autorization_details" is added
   as another top level JSON element.

      "authorization_details":{
         "payment":{
            "instructedAmount":{
               "currency":"EUR",
               "amount":"123.50"
            },
            "debtorAccount":{
               "iban":"DE40100100103307118608"
            },
            "creditorName":"Merchant123",
            "creditorAccount":{
               "iban":"DE02100100109307118603"
            },
            "remittanceInformationUnstructured":"Ref Number Merchant"
         }
      }
   }

   Note: Authorization request URIs containing authorization details in
   a request parameter or a request object can become very long.
   Implementers SHOULD therefore consider to use the "request_uri"
   parameter as defined in [I-D.ietf-oauth-jwsreq], potentially in
   combination with the pushed request object mechanism as defined in
   [PRO] to pass authorization details in a reliable and secure manner.

2.4.  Authorization Request Processing

   Based on the data provided in the "authorization_details" parameter
   the AS will ask the user for consent to the requested access
   permissions.

   Note: the AS is supposed to merge the authorization requirements
   given in the "scope" parameter and the "authorization_details"
   parameter if both are present in the authorization request.

   The AS MUST refuse to process any unknown authorization data type.
   If the "authorization_details" contains any unknown authorization
   data type, the AS MUST abort processing and respond with an error
   "invalid_scope" to the client.

Internet-Draft                  oauth-rar                 September 2019


   If the resource owner grants the client the requested access, the AS
   will issue tokens to the client that are associated with the
   respective "authorization_details".

   The AS MUST make the "authorization_details" available to the
   respective resource servers.  The AS MAY add the
   "authorization_details" element to access tokens in JWT format and to
   Token Introspection responses.

   The AS MUST take into consideration the privacy implications when
   sharing authorization details with the resource servers.  The AS
   SHOULD share this data with the resource servers on a "need to know"
   basis.

2.5.  Token Response

   In addition to the token response parameters as defined in [RFC6749],
   the authorization server MUST also return the authorization details
   as granted by the resource owner and assigned to the respective
   access token.

   This is shown in the following example:

              },
              "remittanceInformationUnstructured":
              "Ref Number Merchant"
             }
           }
        }

2.6.  Relationship to "resource" parameter

   [I-D.ietf-oauth-resource-indicators] defines the request parameter
   "resource" indicating to the AS the resource(s) where the client
   intends to use the access tokens issued based on a certain grant.

   This mechanism is a way to audience restrict access tokens and to
   allow the AS to create resource specific access tokens.

   This draft can be used in conjunction with
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-resource-indicators] in the same way as the "scope"
   parameter.  The AS is supposed to narrow down the authorization
   details and respective permissions to the needs of the particular
   resource when minting an access token.

   While this depends on the AS to know what authorization details are
   relevant for what RS, this draft can also be combined with the
   concept of resource indicators to make this relationsship explicit
   and to narrow the privileges of an access token down to certain



Lodderstedt               Expires March 5, 2020                [Page 11]

Internet-Draft                  oauth-rar                 September 2019


   permissions given on a certain resource down to the individual
   operation (see [I-D.ietf-oauth-security-topics], section-3.3).

   As an example, it is possible to specify that the client will get
   "read" access to "file X" stored at the resource
   "https://store.example.com" [1].  To achieve this, the example given
   above for access to an IMAP server is slightly modfied to use the
   "resource" element as part of the top level claims within the
   authorization data element.

   {
      "https://scheme.examples.org/imap":{
         "resource":"imap.example.com",
         "mailbox":"/users/<current>",
         "access":[
            "read",
            "write"
         ]
      },
      "https://scheme.examples.org/imap$2":{
         "resource":"imap.example.org",
         "mailbox":"/users/shared/folder3",
         "access":[
            "read"
         ]
      }
   }

   The AS MUST respect the value of the "resource" element when deciding
   whether a certain element is placed into a (structured) access token
   or token introspection response.

3.  Metadata

   TBD

   The AS advertises support for "authorization_details" using the
   metadata parameter "authorization_details_supported" of type boolean.

   The authorization data types supported can be determined using the
   metadata parameter "authorization_data_types_supported", which is an
   JSON array.

   Clients annonce the authorization data types the use in the new
   dynamic client registration parameter "authorization_data_types".

   The registration of new authorization data types with the AS is out
   of scope of this draft.

4.  Further Examples

   TBD

   o  self contained (account information, claims, signing)

   o  external reference (payment)

   o  multiple payments

   o  access to e-mail

   o  access to files/directories

5.  Implementation Considerations

   The scheme and processing will significantly vary among different
   authorization data types.  Any implementation of this draft is
   therefore supposed to allow the customization of the user consent and
   the handling of access token data.

   One option would be to have a mechanism allowing the registration of
   extension modules, each of them responsible for rendering the
   respective user consent and any transformation needed to provide the
   data needed to the resource server by way of structured access tokens
   or token introspection responses.

6.  Security Considerations

   Authorization details are sent through the user agent in case of an
   OAuth authorization request, which makes them vulnerable to
   modifications by the user.  In order to ensure their integrity, the
   client SHOULD send authorization details in a signed request object
   as defined in [I-D.ietf-oauth-jwsreq] or use the "request_uri"
   authorization request parameter as defined in [I-D.ietf-oauth-jwsreq]
   to pass the URI of the request object to the authorization server.

7.  Privacy Considerations

   Implementers MUST design and use authorization details in a privacy
   preserving manner.  Any sensitive personal data included in
   authorization details MUST be prevented from leakage, e.g. through
   referrer headers.  Implementation options include encrypted request
   objects as defined in [I-D.ietf-oauth-jwsreq] or transmission of
   authorization details via end-to-end encrypted connections between
   client ans authorization server by utilizing the "request_uri"
   authorization request parameter as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-jwsreq].

   I would would like to thank Brian Campbell, Daniel Fett, Sebastian
   Ebling, Dave Tonge, Mike Jones, Nat Sakimura, Rob Otto, and Justin
   Richer for their valuable feedback during the preparation of this
   draft.

   I would like to thank Dave Tonge and Aaron Parecki for their valuable
   feedback.

9.  IANA Considerations

   o  "authorization_details" as JWT claim

   o  "authorization_details_supported" and
      "authorization_data_types_supported" as metadata parameters

   o  "authorization_data_types" as dynamic client registration
      parameter

   o  establish authorization data type registry
