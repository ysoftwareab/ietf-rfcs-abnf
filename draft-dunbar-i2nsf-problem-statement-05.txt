1. Introduction

   This document describes the motivation and the problem space for the
   Interface to Network Security Functions (I2NSF) effort.

   The growing challenges and complexity in maintaining a secure
   infrastructure, complying with regulatory requirements, and
   controlling costs are enticing enterprises into consuming network
   security functions hosted by service providers. The hosted security
   service is especially attractive to small and medium size
   enterprises who suffer from a lack of security experts to
   continuously monitor, acquire new skills and propose immediate
   mitigations to ever increasing sets of security attacks.

   According to [Gartner-2013], the demand for hosted (or cloud-based)
   security services is growing. Small and medium-sized businesses
   (SMBs) are increasingly adopting cloud-based security services to
   replace on-premises security tools, while larger enterprises are
   deploying a mix of traditional and cloud-based security services.

Internet-Draft          I2NSF Problem Statement




   To meet the demand, more and more service providers are providing
   hosted security solutions to deliver cost-effective managed security
   services to enterprise customers. The hosted security services are
   primarily targeted at enterprises (especially small/medium ones),
   but could also be provided to any kind of mass-market customer.

   As the result, the Network security functions (NSFs) are provided
   and consumed in increasingly diverse environments. Users of NSFs
   could consume network security services hosted by one or more
   providers, which may be their own enterprise, service providers, or
   a combination of both.

   This document does not elaborate on specific use case. The reader
   should refer to [I2NSF-ACCESS], [I2NSF-DC] and [I2NSF-Mobile] for a
   more in-depth discussion on the I2NSF use cases.



2. Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

   This document makes use of the following terms and acronyms:

   DC:         Data Center

   Network Security Function (NSF): functions to ensure integrity,
               confidentiality and availability of network
               communications, to detect unwanted activity, and to
               block it or at least mitigate its effects on the
               network.

   Hosted security function: Refers to a security function that it is
               hosted by another network.

   Flow-based Network Security Function: A function that inspects
               network flows according to a policy intended for


Dunbar, et al.        Expires November 28, 2015                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft          I2NSF Problem Statement


               enforcing security properties.  Flow-based security also
               means that packets are inspected in the order they are
               received, and without modification to the packet due to
               the inspection process (MAC rewrites, TTL decrement
               action; even NAT would be outside the inspection
               process).

3. Problem Space

     The following sub-sections describe the problems and challenges
     facing customers and security service providers (called service
     provider, for short) when security functions are no longer
     physically hosted by customer's administrative domain.

     The "Customer-Provider" relationship may be between any two
     parties: different firms or different domains of the same firm.
     Contractual agreements may be required in such contexts to
     formally document the customer's security requirements and the
     provider's guarantees to fulfill those requirements. Such
     agreements may detail protection levels, escalation procedure,
     alarms reporting, etc. There is currently no standard mechanism to
     capture those requirements.

     Note a service provider may be a customer of another service
     provider.

  3.1. Challenges Facing Security Service Providers

  3.1.1. Diverse types of Security Functions

     There are many types of NSFs. NSFs by different vendors can have
     different features and have different interfaces. NSFs can be
     deployed in multiple locations in a given network, and perhaps
     have different roles.

     Below are a few examples of security functions and locations or
     contexts in which they are often deployed:

     External Intrusion & Attack Protection:
           e.g., Firewall/ACL; Authentication; IPS; IDS; Endpoint
           Protection; etc;



Dunbar, et al.        Expires November 28, 2015                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft          I2NSF Problem Statement


     Security Functions in a DMZ:
           e.g., Firewall/ACL; IDS/IPS, authentication and
           authorization services, NAT, forward proxies, application
           FWs, AAA; etc.

     Internal Security Analysis & report:
           e.g., Security Log; Event Correlation; Forensic Analysis;
           etc;

     Internal Data and Content Protection:
           e.g., Encryption; Authorization; Public/Private key
           management for internal database, etc.


     Given the diversity of security functions, contexts in which they
     can be deployed, and constant evolution of these functions,
     standardizing all aspects of security functions is challenging,
     most probably not feasible, and not necessary. For example, from
     an I2NSF perspective, there is no need to standardize on how a
     firewall filters are created or applied. What is needed is having
     an interface to control and monitor the behavior of NSFs.



  3.1.2.  Diverse Interfaces to Control NSFs

     To provide effective and competitive solutions and services,
     Security Service Providers may need to utilize multiple security
     functions from various vendors to enforce the security policies
     desired by their customers.

     Yet because no widely accepted industry standard security
     interfaces exist today, management of NSFs (device and policy
     provisioning, monitoring, etc.) tends to be bespoke, essentially
     as offered by product vendors. As a result, automation of such
     services, if it exists at all, is also bespoke. It is worth noting
     that even with the traditional way of deploying security features,
     there is still a gap to coordinate among implementations from
     distinct vendors. This is mainly the reason why mono-vendor
     security functions are enabled in a given network segment.

Internet-Draft          I2NSF Problem Statement


  3.1.3. Diverse Interface to monitor the behavior of NSFs

     Obviously, enabling a security function (e.g., firewall [I-D.ietf-
     opsawg-firewalls]) does not mean that a network is protected. As
     such, it is necessary to have a mechanism to monitor the execution
     status of NSFs.

  3.1.4. More Distributed NSFs and vNSFs

     The security functions that are invoked to enforce a security
     policy can be located in different equipment and network
     locations.

     The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) Network
     Function Virtualization (NFV) initiative creates new management
     challenges for security policies to be enforced by distributed,
     virtual, network security functions (vNSF).

     vNSF has higher risk of failure, migrating, and state changes as
     their hosting VMs being created, moved, or decommissioned.

  3.1.5. More Demand to Control NSFs Dynamically

     In the advent of SDN [SDN-Security], more clients, applications or
     application controllers need to dynamically update their
     communication policies that are enforced by NSFs. The Security
     Service Providers have to dynamically update control requests to
     NSFs upon receiving the requests from their clients.


  3.1.6. Demand for multi-tenancy to control and monitor NSFs.

     Service providers may require having several operational units to
     control and monitor the NSFs, especially when NSFs become
     distributed and virtualized.



  3.1.7. Lack of Characterization of NSFs and Capability Exchange

     To offer effective security services, service providers need to
     activate various security functions manufactured by multiple


Dunbar, et al.        Expires November 28, 2015                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft          I2NSF Problem Statement


     vendors. Even within one product category (e.g., firewall),
     security functions provided by different vendors can have
     different features and capabilities: filters that can be designed
     and activated by a firewall may or may not support IPv6, depending
     on the firewall technology, for example.

     Service Provider management system (or controller) needs ways to
     retrieve the capabilities of service functions by different
     vendors so that it could build an effective security solution.

     These capabilities can be documented in a static manner or via an
     interface for security functions vendors to register to service
     provider security management system. This dynamic capability
     registration is useful for automation because security functions
     may be subject to software and hardware updates. These updates may
     have implications on the policies enforced by the NSFs.

     Today, there is no standard method for vendors to describe the
     capabilities of their security functions. Without a common
     technical framework to describe the capabilities of security
     functions, service providers can't automate the process of
     selecting NSFs by different vendors to accommodate customer's
     requirements.



  3.1.8. Lack of mechanism for NSFs to utilize external profiles

     Many security functions depend on signature files or profiles to
     perform, e.g. IPS/IDS Signatures. Different policies might need
     different signatures or profiles. Today, most vendors have their
     vendor specific signatures or profiles.  As the industry moves
     towards more open environment, sharing profile or black database
     can be win-win strategy for all parties involved. There might be
     Open Source provided signature/profiles (e.g. by Snort or others)
     in the future.

     There is a need to have a standard envelop (i.e. the format) to
     allow NSFs to use external profiles.

Internet-Draft          I2NSF Problem Statement






  3.2. Challenges Facing Customers

     When customers invoke hosted security services, their security
     policies may be enforced by a collection of security functions
     hosted in different domains. Customers may not have security
     skills. As such, they may not be able to express sufficiently
     precise requirements or security policies. Usually these customers
     express expectations (that can be viewed as loose security
     requirements). Customers may also express guidelines such as which
     critical communications are to be preserved during critical
     events, which hosts are to service even during severe security
     attacks, etc.

  3.2.1. NSFs from heterogeneous administrative domains

     Many medium and large enterprises have deployed various on-
     premises security functions which they want to continue to use.
     They are looking for combining local security functions with
     remote hosted security functions to achieve more efficient and
     immediate counter-measures to both Internet-originated attacks and
     enterprise network-originated attacks.

     Some enterprises may only need the hosted security services for
     their remote branch offices where minimal security
     infrastructures/capabilities exist.  The security solution can
     consist of NSFs on customer networks and NSFs on service provider
     networks.


  3.2.2. Today's Control Requests are Vendors Specific

     Customers may consume NSFs by multiple service providers.
     Customers need to express their security requirements, guidelines,
     and expectations to the service providers, which in turn will be
     translated into security policies and associated configuration
     sets to the set of security functions.  But no standard technical
     characterization and/or APIs exist, even for most common security



Dunbar, et al.        Expires November 28, 2015                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft          I2NSF Problem Statement


     services. Most security services are accessible only through
     disparate, proprietary interfaces (e.g., portals, APIs), in
     whatever format vendors choose to offer.

     Without standard interfaces it is complex for customers to update
     security policies and integrate with services provided by the
     security service providers. This complexity is induced by the
     diversity of the configuration models, policy models, supported
     management interfaces, etc.

     The current practices that rely on the use of scripts that
     generates automatically scripts have to be adjusted each time an
     implementation from a different vendor is enabled in a provider
     side.

     Customers may also require means to easily update/modify their
     security requirements with immediate effect in the underlying
     involved NSFs.

     While security agreements are in place, security functions may be
     solicited without requiring an explicit invocation means.
     Nevertheless, some explicit invocation means may be required to
     interact with a service function.

     Here is an example of how standard interfaces could help achieve
     faster implementation time cycles. Let us consider a customer who
     would like to dynamically allow an encrypted flow with specific
     port, src/dst addresses or protocol type through the firewall/IPS
     to enable an encrypted video conferencing call only during the
     time of the call. With no commonly accepted interface in place,
     the customer would have to learn about the particular provider's
     firewall/IPS interface, and send the request in the provider's
     required format. If a firewall/IPS interface standard exists, the
     customer would be able to send the request, without having to do
     much preliminary legwork. Such a standard helps providers too
     since they could now offer the same firewall/IPS interface to
     represent firewall/IPS services, which may be offered by different
     vendors' products. They have now abstracted the firewall/IPS
     services. Lastly, it helps the firewall/IPS vendors since they
     could now work on common specifications.

  3.2.3. Difficulty to Monitor the Execution of Desired Policies

     How a policy is translated into technology-specific actions is
     hidden from the customers. However, customers still need ways to
     monitor the delivered security service that is the result of the
     execution of their desired security requirements, guidelines and
     expectations.

     Today, there is no standard way for customers to get security
     service assurance (including running "what-if" scenarios to assess
     the efficiency of the delivered security service) of their
     specified security policies properly enforced by the security
     functions in the provider domain.


  3.3. Difficulty to Validate Policies across Multiple Domains

     One key aspect of a hosted security service with security
     functions located at different premises is to have a standard
     interface to express, monitor and verify security policies that
     combine several distributed security functions. This becomes more
     crucial when NSFs are instantiated in Virtual Machines because
     NSFs can be more distributed and sometimes multiple NSFs are
     combined together to perform one task.

     Without standard interfaces and security policy data models, the
     enforcement of a customer-driven security policy remains
     challenging because of the inherent complexity brought by the
     combined invocation of several, yet vendor-specific security
     functions, but also because of the accompanying complexity of
     configuration procedures and operational tasks in a multi-vendor,
     heterogeneous environment.

     Ensuring the consistent enforcement of the policies at various
     domains is challenging. Standard data models are likely to
     contribute to softening that issue.

Internet-Draft          I2NSF Problem Statement


  3.4. Lack of Standard Interface to Inject Feedback to NSF

     Today, many security functions, such as IPS and Antivirus, depend
     heavily on the associated profiles. They can perform more
     effective protection if they have the up-to-date profiles. As more
     sophisticated threats arise, enterprises, vendors, and service
     providers have to rely on each other to achieve optimal
     protection.  [CA] is one of those initiatives that aim at
     combining efforts conducted by multiple organizations.

     Today there is no standard interface to exchange security profiles
     between organizations.


  3.5. Lack of Standard Interface for Capability Negotiation

     There could be situations when the NSFs selected can't perform the
     policies from the Security Controller, due to resource
     constraints. To support the automatic control in the SDN-era, it
     is necessary to have a set of messages for proper negotiation
     between the Security Controller and the NSFs.

4. Scope of the proposed work

     The primary goal of I2NSF is to define an information model, a set
     of software interfaces and data models for controlling and
     monitoring aspects of physical and virtual NSFs. Other aspects of
     NSFs, such as device or network provisioning and configuration,
     are out of scope. Controlling and monitoring of NSFs should
     include the ability to specify, query, monitor, and control the
     NSFs by one or more management entities. Since different security
     vendors support different features and functions on their devices,
     I2NSF will focus on flow-based NSFs that provide treatment to
     packets/flows, such as IPS/IDS, Web filtering, flow filtering,
     deep packet inspection, or pattern matching and remediation.

     There are two layers of interfaces envisioned in the I2NSF
     approach:





Dunbar, et al.        Expires November 28, 2015               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft          I2NSF Problem Statement


       - The I2NSF Capability Layer specifies how to control and
          monitor NSFs at a functional implementation level. That is,
          I2NSF will standardize a set of interfaces by which control
          and management of NSFs may be invoked, operated, and
          monitored. (I2NSF will not work on any other aspects of NSFs.
          Nor will I2NSF at this stage specify how to derive control
          and monitoring capabilities from higher level security
          policies for the Capability Layer.)
       - The I2NSF Service Layer defines how clients' security
          policies may be expressed and monitored. The Service Layer is
          out of scope for this phase of I2NSF's work. However, I2NSF
          will provide a forum for Informational drafts on data models,
          APIs, etc. that demonstrate how service layer policies may be
          translated to Capability Layer functions.

     The concrete work at the I2NSF Capability Layer includes
     development of
       - An information model that defines concepts required for
          standardizing the control and monitoring of NSFs.
       - A set of YANG data models, derived from the above information
          model.
       - The capability registry (IANA) that enables the
          characteristics and behavior of NSFs to be specified using a
          vendor-neutral vocabulary without requiring the NSFs
          themselves to be standardized. The registry enables various
          mechanisms, including policy rules, to be used to match
          monitor and control functions to the needs of an application
          and/or environment.
       - The proper secure communication channels to carry the
          controlling and monitoring information between the NSFs and
          their management entity (or entities).


     Standard interfaces for monitoring and controlling the behavior of
     NSFs are essential building blocks for Security Service Providers
     to automate the use of different NSFs from multiple vendors by
     their Security management entities. This work will leverage the
     existing protocols and data models defined by I2RS, Netconf, and
     NETMOD.

Internet-Draft          I2NSF Problem Statement


     I2NSF may be invoked by any (authorized) client-e.g., upstream
     applications (controllers), orchestration systems, security
     portals, etc.


5. Other Potential Uses of I2NSF

     The I2NSF framework allows the clients to view, request, and/or
     verify the security functions/policies offered by providers at
     different premises. This framework can make it possible for a
     cluster of devices requiring the similar security policies to have
     consistent policies across multiple sites.

     Network service providers can provide "Hosted Security Functions"
     services.  Network providers can also act as security function
     brokers to facilitate if not optimize the enforcement of customer-
     driven security policies. They can expose a service catalog and
     standard mechanisms by which enterprises (or applications) can
     query, request, or/and verify the needed security functions or
     policies.

     With the standard interfaces for clients to request the required
     security functions and policies, network operators can leverage
     their current service to enterprises (e.g. VPN, private IP
     services) and access to a vast population of end users to offer a
     set of consolidated Security solutions and policies. Network
     operators can be instrumental in defining a common interface and
     framework as part of an IETF-conducted specification effort.



6. Related Industry Initiatives
  6.1. Related IETF WGs

     IETF NETCONF: I2NSF should consider using the NETCONF protocol
     exchange security policy provisioning information between
     participating devices/security functions and the computation logic
     (a.k.a., a security Policy Decision Point (PDP)) that resides in
     the control plane and which makes the decisions to dynamically
     allocate resources and enforce customer-driven security policies.

Internet-Draft          I2NSF Problem Statement


     NETMOD ACL Model: [I-D.ietf-netmod-acl-model] describes the very
     basic attributes for access control. I2NSF will extend the ACL
     data model to be more comprehensive, for example, extend to
     multiple actions and policies, and describes various services
     associated with the security functions under consideration.

     In addition, I2NSF has to specify ways to monitor/report of Packet
     Based Security Functions.

     I2RS: the WG currently discusses the specification of an interface
     between the forwarding and the control planes, to facilitate the
     dynamic enforcement of traffic forwarding policies based upon
     IGP/BGP route computation results. I2NSF is looking specifically
     into expressing security policies in two layers. I2NSF should
     leverage the protocols and data models developed by I2RS.

     I2NSF aims to develop the additional information models and data
     models for distributed security functions, like the firewall and
     IPS/IDS. The policy structure specified by [I-D.hares-i2rs-bnp-
     info-model] can be used by I2NSF to be extended to include
     recursive actions to other security functions.

     The IETF SFC WG specifies service function chaining techniques
     while treating service functions as a black box; VNFpool is about
     the reliability and availability of the virtualized network
     functions. But neither addresses how service functions are
     invoked, or configured.

     Both SFC and VNFpool do not cover in-depth specification (e.g.
     rules for the requested FW) to invoke security functions. In SFC
     and VNFpool, a firewall function is a black box that is treated in
     the same way as a video optimization function. SFC and VNFpool do
     not cover the negotiation part, e.g. Client needs Rules x/y/z for
     FW, but the Provider can only offer x/z.

     The IETF SACM (Security Assessment and Continuous Monitoring) WG
     specifies mechanisms to assess endpoint security. The endpoints
     can be routers, switches, clustered DB, or an installed piece of
     software. SACM is about "How to encode that policy in a manner
     where assessment can be automated". For example:

       - a Solaris 10 SPARC or Windows 7 system used in an environment
          that requires adherence to a policy of Mission Critical
          Classified,
       - rules like "The maximum password age must be 30 days" and
          "The minimum password age must be 1 day"

     [I2NSF-GAP] has a more extensive study comparing I2NSF with
     various existing efforts in similar/adjacent areas.

  6.2. Relationship with ETSI NFV ISG

     ETSI's NFV ISG defines the architecture to pool together many
     virtual network functions to be managed and consumed collectively.

     I2NSF is one of the enabling tools for NFV, specifically the VNF
     as a Service (VNFaaS) specified by ETSI NFV Group Specification
     Use Cases [gs_NFV].

     ETSI's NFV ISG effort is actively contributed by service
     providers. It defines a detailed service model for VNFaaS as well
     as requirements that should be taken into account by the I2NSF
     initiative.

  6.3. OpenStack Firewall/Security as a Service

     Open source projects like OpenStack and CloudStack have begun to
     tackle the issues of interfaces to security functions but much
     work remains.

     OpenStack completed the Firewall as a Service project and
     specified the set of APIs for Firewall services [API]

     OpenStack has defined the APIs for managing Security Groups [SG]

     The attributes defined by OpenStack Firewall/Security as a Service
     are at this point are basic. However, they can serve as the basis
     of the information model that the I2NSF IETF initiative aims to
     specify.

  6.4.  Security as a Service by Cloud Security Alliance

     https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/research/secaas/#_get-involved

     SaaS by CSA is at the initial stage of defining the scope of work.

7. Manageability Considerations

     Management of NSFs usually include configuration of devices,
     signaling and policy provisioning. I2NSF will only focus on the
     policy provisioning part.

8. Security Considerations

     Having a secure access to control and monitor NSFs is crucial for
     hosted security service. Therefore, proper secure communication
     channels have to be carefully specified for carrying the
     controlling and monitoring information between the NSFs and their
     management entity (or entities).

Internet-Draft          I2NSF Problem Statement


     Open-source initiatives are not to be considered as an alternative
     to formal standardization processes. On the contrary, they are
     complementary, with the former acting as an enabler and
     accelerator of the latter. Open-source provides an ideal mechanism
     to quick prototyping and validating contending proposals, and
     demonstrating the feasibility of disruptive ideas that could
     otherwise not be considered. In this respect, open-source
     facilitates the engagement in the standardization process of small
     (and typically more dynamic) players such as start-ups and
     research groups, which would see better opportunities of being
     heard and a clearer rewards to their efforts. An open-source
     approach is extremely useful as well for the production of open
     reference implementations of the standards at the same (or even
     faster) pace they are defined. The availability of such reference
     implementations translate into much simpler interoperability and
     conformance assessments for both providers and users, and can
     become the basis for incremental differentiation of a common
     solution, thus allowing a cooperative competition ("coopetition")
     model.
