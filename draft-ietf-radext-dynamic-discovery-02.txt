1.  Introduction

1.1.  Requirements Language

   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
   of the specification.  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   RFC 2119.  [RFC2119]

1.2.  Terminology

   RADIUS/TLS Client: a RADIUS/TLS [I-D.ietf-radext-radsec] instance
   which initiates a new connection.

   RADIUS/TLS Server: a RADIUS/TLS [I-D.ietf-radext-radsec] instance
   which listens on a RADIUS/TLS port and accepts new connections

   RADIUS/TLS node: a RADIUS/TLS client or server

2.  DNS-based NAPTR/SRV Peer Discovery

2.1.  Applicability

   Dynamic server discovery as defined in this document is only
   applicable for AAA transactions where a AAA server receives a request
   with a NAI realm for which no home AAA server is known.  I.e. where
   static server configuration does not contain a known home
   authentication server, or where the server configuration explicitly
   states that the realm destination is to be looked up dynamically.
   Furthermore, it is only applicable for new user sessions, i.e. for
   the initial Access-Request.  Subsequent messages concerning this
   session, for example Access-Challenges, Access-Accepts, Accounting
   Messages or Change-of-Authorisation messages use the previously-
   established communication channel between client and server.

2.2.  DNS RR definition

   DNS definitions of RADIUS/TLS servers can be either S-NAPTR records
   (see [RFC3958]) or SRV records.  When both are defined, the
   resolution algorithm prefers S-NAPTR results (see section Section 2.3
   below).

   This specification defines two S-NAPTR service tag: a general-purpose
   tag "nai-roaming" and a special-purpose tag "eduroam" for the eduroam
   roaming consortium.  This specification defines two S-NAPTR protocol
   tags: "radius.tls" for RADIUS over TLS [I-D.ietf-radext-radsec] and
   "radius.dtls" for RADIUS over DTLS [I-D.dekok-radext-dtls].

   This specification defines the SRV prefix "_radiustls._tcp" for
   RADIUS over TLS [I-D.ietf-radext-radsec] and "_radiustls._udp" for
   RADIUS over DTLS [I-D.dekok-radext-dtls].  It is expected that in
   most cases, the label used for the records is the DNS representation
   (punycode) of the literal realm name for which the server is the AAA
   server.

   However, arbitrary other labels may be used if, for example, a
   roaming consortium uses realm names which are not associated to DNS
   names or special-purpose consortia where a globally valid discovery
   is not a use case.  Such other labels require a consortium-wide
   agreement about the transformation from realm name to lookup label.

   Examples:

   a.  A general-purpose AAA server for realm example.com might have DNS
       entries as follows:

          example.com.  IN NAPTR 50 50 "s" "nai-roaming:radius.tls" ""
          _radiustls._tcp.foobar.example.com.

          _radiustls._tcp.example.com.  IN SRV 0 10 2083
          radsec.example.com.

   b.  The consortium "foo" provides roaming services for its members
       only.  The realms used are of the form enterprise-name.example.
       The consortium operates a special purpose DNS server for the
       (private) TLD "example" which all AAA servers use to resolve
       realm names.  "Bad, Inc." is part of the consortium.  On the
       consortium's DNS server, realm bad.example might have the
       following DNS entries:

          bad.example IN NAPTR 50 50 "a" "nai-roaming:radius.dtls" ""
          "very.bad.example"

   c.  the eduroam consortium uses realms based on DNS, but provides its
       services to a closed community only.  However, a AAA domain
       participating in eduroam may also want to expose AAA services to
       other, general-purpose, applications (on the same or other AAA
       servers).  Due to that, the eduroam consortium uses the service
       tag "eduroam" and eduroam AAA servers use this tag to look up
       other eduroam servers.  An eduroam participant example.org which
       also provides general-purpose AAA on a different server uses the
       general "nai-roaming" tag:

          example.org.  IN NAPTR 50 50 "s" "eduroam:radius.tls" ""
          _radiustls._tcp.eduroam.example.org.

          example.org.  IN NAPTR 50 50 "s" "nai-roaming:radius.tls" ""
          _radiustls._tcp.aaa.example.org

          _radiustls._tcp.eduroam.example.org.  IN SRV 0 10 2083 aaa-
          eduroam.example.org.

          _radiustls._tcp.aaa.example.org.  IN SRV 0 10 2083 aaa-
          default.example.org.

2.3.  Realm to AAA server resolution algorithm

   Input I to the algorithm is a User-Name in the form of a NAI as
   defined in [RFC4282] as extracted from the User-Name attribute in an
   Access-Request.  Output O of the algorithm is a set of hostname:port
   and an associated order/preference; the set can be empty.

   Note well: The attribute User-Name does not necessarily contain well-
   formed NAIs and may not even contain well-formed UTF-8 strings.  This
   document describes server discovery only for well-formed NAIs in
   UTF-8 encoding.  The result of all other possible contents of User-
   Name is unspecified; this includes, but is not limited to:

      Usage of separators other than @

      Usage of multiple @ separators

      Encoding of User-Name in local encodings

   The algorithm to determine the AAA server to contact is as follows:

   1.   Determine P = (position of first "@" character) in I.

   2.   generate R = (substring from P+1 to end of I)

   3.   Optional: modify R according to agreed consortium procedures

   4.   Using the host's name resolution library, perform a NAPTR query
        for R. If no result, continue at step 9.  If name resolution
        returns with error, O = { }.  Terminate.

   5.   Extract NAPTR records with service tag "nai-roaming" (replace
        with other service tags where applicable).

   6.   If no result, continue at step 9.

   7.   Evaluate NAPTR result(s) for desired protocol tag, perform
        subsequent lookup steps until lookup yields one or more
        hostnames.  O = (set of {Order/Preference, hostname:port} for

        all lookup results).

   8.   Terminate.

   9.   Generate R' = (prefix R with "_radiustls._tcp." or
        "_radiustls._udp")

   10.  Using the host's name resolution library, perform SRV lookup
        with R' as label.

   11.  If name resolution returns with error, O = { }.  Terminate.

   12.  If no result, O = {}; terminate.

   13.  Perform subsequent lookup steps until lookup yields one or more
        hostnames.  O = (set of {Order/Preference, hostname} for all
        hostnames).  Terminate.

   Example: Assume a user from the Technical University of Munich,
   Germany, has a RADIUS User-Name of
   "foobar@tu-m[U+00FC]nchen.example".  If DNS contains the following
   records:

      xn--tu-mnchen-t9a.example.  IN NAPTR 50 50 "s" "nai-
      roaming:radius.tls" "" _radiustls._tcp.xn--tu-mnchen-t9a.example.

      xn--tu-mnchen-t9a.example.  IN NAPTR 50 50 "s" "fooservice:
      bar.dccp" "" _abc._def.xn--tu-mnchen-t9a.example.

      _radiustls._tcp.xn--tu-mnchen-t9a.example.  IN SRV 0 10 2083
      radsec.xn--tu-mnchen-t9a.example.

      _radiustls._tcp.xn--tu-mnchen-t9a.example.  IN SRV 0 20 2083
      backup.xn--tu-mnchen-t9a.example.

      radsec.xn--tu-mnchen-t9a.example.  IN AAAA 2001:0DB8::202:44ff:
      fe0a:f704

      radsec.xn--tu-mnchen-t9a.example.  IN A 192.0.2.3

      backup.xn--tu-mnchen-t9a.example.  IN A 192.0.2.7

   Then the algorithm executes as follows, with I =
   "foobar@tu-m[U+00FC]nchen.example", and no consortium name mangling
   in use:

   1.   P = 7

   2.   R = "tu-m[U+00FC]nchen.example"

   3.   NOOP

   4.   Query result: ( 50 50 "s" "nai-roaming:radius.tls" ""
        _radiustls._tcp.xn--tu-mnchen-t9a.example. ; 50 50 "s"
        "fooservice:bar.dccp" "" _abc._def.xn--tu-mnchen-t9a.example. )

   5.   Result: 50 50 "s" "nai-roaming:radius.tls" ""
        _radiustls._tcp.xn--tu-mnchen-t9a.example.

   6.   NOOP

   7.   O = {(10,radsec.xn--tu-mnchen-t9a.example.:2083),(20,backup.xn--
        tu-mnchen-t9a. example.:2083)}

   8.   Terminate.

   9.   (not executed)

   10.  (not executed)

   11.  (not executed)

   12.  (not executed)

   13.  (not executed)

   The implementation will then attempt to connect to two servers, with
   preference to radsec.xn--tu-mnchen-t9a.example.:2083, using either
   the AAAA or A addresses depending on the host configuration and its
   IP stack's capabilities.

3.  Security Considerations

   When using DNS without security, the replies to NAPTR, SRV and A/AAAA
   requests as described in section Section 2 can not be trusted.
   RADIUS transports have an out-of-DNS-band means to verify that the
   discovery attempt led to the intended target (TLS/DTLS: ceritifcate
   verification or TLS shared secret ciphers; UDP/TCP: the RADIUS shared
   secret) and are safe from DNS-based redirection attacks.  [Note:
   assuming here that a hypothetical RADIUS/UDP SRV discovery will NOT
   deliver the shared secret in the DNS response!]

   The discovery process is always susceptible to bidding down attacks
   if a realm has SRV records for RADIUS/UDP and/or RADIUS/TCP as well
   as for RADIUS/TLS and/or RADIUS/DTLS.  While the SRV query will
   expose both transports, an attacker in the routing path might

   suppress the subsequent A/AAAA results for the TLS or DTLS peer and
   trick the initiating peer into using the weakly protected UDP or TCP
   transports.  The use of DNSSEC can not fully mitigate this attack,
   since it does not provide a means to detect packet suppression.  The
   only way to disable such bidding down attacks is by intiating
   connections only to the peer(s) which match or exceed a configured
   minimum security level.  All implementations SHOULD provide a means
   to configure the administratively desired minimum security level.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA registration of the following S-NAPTR
   parameters:

   o  Application Service Tags

      *  nai-roaming

      *  eduroam

   o  Application Protocol Tags

      *  radius.tls

      *  radius.dtls
