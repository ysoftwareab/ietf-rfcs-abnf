                  draft-bishop-httpbis-altsvc-quic-00

Abstract

   [RFC7838] defines the ALTSVC frame for HTTP/2 [RFC7540].  This frame
   is equally applicable to HTTP/QUIC ([I-D.ietf-quic-http]), but needs
   to be separately registered.  This document describes the ALTSVC
   frame for HTTP/QUIC.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC7838] defines HTTP Alternative Services, which allow an origin's
   resources to be authoritatively available at a separate network
   location, possibly accessed with a different protocol configuration.
   It defines two mechanisms for transporting such information, an HTTP
   response header and an HTTP/2 frame type.

   [I-D.ietf-quic-http] describes the required updates for HTTP/2 frames
   to be used with HTTP/QUIC.  Only a few modifications are required for
   the ALTSVC frame.  No modifications are required for the "Alt-Svc"
   header field.

2.  The ALTSVC HTTP/QUIC Frame

   The ALTSVC HTTP/QUIC frame advertises the availability of an
   alternative service to an HTTP/QUIC client.

   An ALTSVC frame from a server to a client on stream 1 (not 0, as in
   HTTP/2) indicates that the conveyed alternative service is associated
   with the origin contained in the Origin field of the frame.

   An ALTSVC frame from a server to a client on a stream other than
   stream 1 indicates that the conveyed alternative service is
   associated with the origin of that stream.

   The layout and semantics of the frame are identical to those of the
   HTTP/2 frame defined in [RFC7838].  The ALTSVC frame type is 0xa
   (decimal 10), as in HTTP/2.

3.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces no new security considerations beyond those
   discussed in [RFC7838] and [I-D.ietf-quic-http].
