<a href="#rfc.section.1">1.</a> Introduction</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">With rising energy cost and with an increasing awareness of the ecological impact of running IT and networking equipment, energy management is becoming an additional basic requirement for the network devices and the associated network management systems.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">This document defines requirements for standards specifications for energy management. This doccument contains the requirements that concern monitoring functions as well as control functions. In detail, the requirements listed are focussed on the following features: identification of powered entities, monitoring of their power state, power inlets, power outlets, actual power, power quality, consumed energy, and contained batteries. Further included is control of powered entities' power supply and power state.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.3">The main subject of energy management are powered entities that consume electric energy. Powered entities include devices that have an IP address and can be addressed directly, such as hosts, routers, and middleboxes, as well as devices indirectly connected to an IP network, for which a proxy with an IP address provides a management interface, for example, devices in a building management infrastructure using the BACnet <a href="#ANSI/ASHRAE-135-2010">[ANSI/ASHRAE-135-2010]</a> or MODBUS <a href="#MODBUS-Protocol">[MODBUS-Protocol]</a> protocols.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.4">The requirements specified in this document explicitly concern the standards specification process and not the implementation of specified standards. All requirements in this document must be reflected by standards specifications to be developed. But which of the features specified by these standards will be mandatory, recommended, or optional for compliant implementations is to be defined by the concrete standards track document(s) and not in this document.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.5">This document first elaborates a set of general considerations related to energy management in <a href="#goals">Section 3</a>. Requirements for an energy management standard are specified in Sections <a href="#identity">4</a> to <a href="#controlother">8</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.6">Sections <a href="#identity">4</a> to <a href="#control">6</a> contain rather conventional requirements specifying which information on powered entities needs to be covered by an energy management standard, and which control functions are needed.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.7">Sections <a href="#reportonother">7</a> and <a href="#controlother">8</a> contain requirements that are very specific to energy management. They result from the fact that due to the nature of power supply, some of the monitoring and control functions are not conducted by interacting with the powered entity of interest, but with other entities, for example, with entities upstream in the power distribution tree.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.1.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.1.1">1.1.</a> <a href="#conventional" id="conventional">Conventional requirements for energy management</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.1">The specification of requirements for an energy management standard starts with <a href="#identity">Section 4</a> addressing the identification of powered entities and the granularity of reporting of energy-related information. A standard must support unique identification of powered entities. Furthermore, it must support more than just reporting per powered device.  Support is required for also reporting energy-related information on individual components of a device or subtended devices.  This is why this draft uses the more general term "powered entity" rather than "powered device". A powered entity may be a device or a component of a device.</p>
<p><a href="#properties">Section 5</a> specifies requirements related to monitoring of powered entities. This includes general (type, context) information and specific information on power states, power inlets, power outlets, power, energy, and batteries. Control power state and power supply of powered entities is covered by requirements specified in <a href="#control">Section 6</a>.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.1.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.1.2">1.2.</a> Specific requirements for energy management</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.1">At first glance the rather conventional requirements summarized above seem to be all that would be needed for energy management. But it turns out that there are some significant differences between energy management and most of the well known conventional network management functions.  The most significant difference from many other management functions is the need for some devices to report on other entities. There are three major reasons for this.  </p>

<ul>
<li>For monitoring a particular powered entity in general it is not sufficient to communicate with the powered entity only, particularly if the powered entity has no instrumentation for measuring power. In such cases it might still be possible to obtain power values for the entity by communication with other entities in the same power distribution tree. <br> A very simple example would be retrieving power values from a dedicated power meter at the power line of the powered entity.  More common examples are a Power Distribution Unit (PDU) and a Power over Ethernet (PoE) switch. Both supply power to other entities at sockets or ports, respectively, and are often instrumented to measure power per socket or port.</li>
<li>Similar considerations apply to controlling power supply of a powered entity which often needs direct or indirect communication with another entity upstream in the power distribution tree.  Again, a PDU and a PoE switch are common examples, if they have the capability to switch on or off power at their sockets or ports, respectively.</li>
<li>Energy management often extends its scope beyond powered entities with IP network interfaces, for example toward non-IP building networks, that are accessed via an IP gateway.  Requirements in this document do not fully cover all these networks, but they cover means for opening IP network management towards them.</li>
<li>For monitoring of particular powered entities, it is sometimes not a scalable approach to communicate directly with all the powered entities directly from a central energy management system as the number of powered entities keeps increasing.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.2">This specific issue of energy management and a set of further ones are covered by requirements specified in Sections <a href="#reportonother">7</a> and <a href="#controlother">8</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.3">For meeting the requirements specified in these sections first a new energy management framework needs to be specified that gives directions on how to deal with the specific nature of energy management.  Based on such a framework, energy management standards can be specified that meet the requirements below.  The actual standards documents, such as, for example, MIB module specifications, will address conformance issues by specifying which feature must, should, or may to be implemented by compliant implementations.</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.1">The basic objective of energy management is operating sets of devices with minimal amount of energy, while maintaining a certain level of service.  A set of use cases and the target devices for the application of energy management can be found in <a href="#I-D.tychon-eman-applicability-statement">[I-D.tychon-eman-applicability-statement]</a>.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.3.1">3.1.</a> <a href="#powerstates" id="powerstates">Power states</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.1">One approach to achieve this goal is by setting all powered entities to an operational state that results in lower energy consumption, but still meets the service level performance objectives. The sufficient performance level may vary over time and can depend on several factors.  In principle, there are four basic types of power states for a powered entity or for a whole system: <a href="#IEEE-1621">[IEEE-1621]</a> model of three states on, off, and sleep.  However, more finely grained power states can be implemented with many levels of off, sleep, and reduced power states.</p>

<ul>
<li>full power state</li>
<li>reduced power states (lower clock rate for processor, lower data rate on a link, etc.)</li>
<li>sleep state (not functional, but immediately available)</li>
<li>off state (may imply requiring significant time for becoming operational)</li>
</ul>

<p> In actual implementations the number of power states and their properties vary a lot. Very simple powered entities may just have only the extreme states, full power and off state. Some implementations might use the IEEE 1621 </p>

<a href="#rfc.section.3.2">3.2.</a> <a href="#tradeoffs" id="tradeoffs">Saving energy versus maintaining service level agreements</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.1">While the general objective of energy management is quite clear, the way to attain that goal is often difficult.  In many cases there is no way of reducing power consumption without the consequence of a potential performance, service, or capacity degradation. Then a trade-off needs to be dealt with between service level objectives and energy efficiency.  In other cases a reduction of energy consumption can easily be achieved while still maintaining sufficient service level performance, for example, by switching powered entities to lower power states when higher performance is not needed.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.3.3">3.3.</a> <a href="#localglobal" id="localglobal">Local versus network-wide       energy management</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.1">Many energy saving functions can be executed locally by a powered entity. The basic principle is that a powered entity monitors its usage and dynamically adapts its energy consumption according to the required performance. It may, for example, switch to a sleep state when it is not in use or out of scheduled business hours.  Potential interactions with an energy management system for such an entity include the observation of the entity's power state and the configuration of power saving policies, for example, by setting thresholds or schedules for power state changes.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.2">Energy savings can also be achieved with policies implemented by a network management system that controls power states of managed entities. In order to make policy decisions properly, information about the energy consumption of powered entities in different power states is required. Often this information is acquired best through monitoring.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.3">Both methods, network-wide and local energy management, have advantages and disadvantages and often it is a good choice to combine them. Central management is often favorable for setting power states of a large number of entities at the same time, for example, at beginning and end of business hours in a building. Local management appears often to be preferable for dynamic power saving measures based on local observations, such as high or low load of an entity.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3.4">
<a href="#rfc.section.3.4">3.4.</a> <a href="#monitoring" id="monitoring">Energy monitoring versus energy saving</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.4.p.1">It should be noted that only monitoring energy consumption and power states is obviously not a means to reduce the energy consumption of a powered entity. In fact, it is likely to increase the power consumption of a powered entity slightly because monitoring energy may require instrumentation that consumes energy when in use. And also reporting of measured quantities over the network consumes energy.  However, the acquired energy consumption and power state information is essential for defining energy saving policies and can be used as input to power state control loops that in total can lead to energy savings.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.4.p.2">Monitoring operational power states and energy consumption can also be required for other energy management purposes including but not limited to: </p>

<ul>
<li>investigating power saving potential</li>
<li>evaluating the effectiveness of energy saving policies and measures</li>
<li>deriving, implementing, and testing power management strategies</li>
<li>accounting for the total power consumption of a powered entity, a network, or a service</li>

<p id="rfc.section.3.5.p.1">From the considerations described above the following basic management functions appear to be required for energy management: </p>

<ul>
<li>monitoring power states</li>
<li>monitoring power (energy consumption rate)</li>
<li>monitoring (accumulated) energy consumption</li>
<li>monitoring power quality</li>
<li>setting power states</li>
<li>setting and enforcing power saving policies</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.3.5.p.2">It should be noted that power control is complementary (but essential) to other energy savings measures such as low power electronics, energy saving protocols (for example, Energy-Efficient Ethernet <a href="#IEEE-802.3az">[IEEE-802.3az]</a>), energy-efficient device design (for example, sleep and low-power modes for individual components of a device), and energy-efficient network architectures.

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.1">As already stated in <a href="#conventional">Section 1.1</a>, powered entities on which energy-related information is provided, are identified in a sufficiently unique way. This holds in particular for powered entities that are components of managed devices and in case that one powered entity reports information on another one, see <a href="#reportonother">Section 7</a>. For powered entities that control other powered entities it is important to identify the powered entities they control, see <a href="#controlother">Section 8</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.2">Also stated already in <a href="#conventional">Section 1.1</a> is the requirement of providing means for reporting energy-related information on components of a managed device. An entity in this document may be an entire managed device or just a component of it. Examples of components of interest are a hard drive, a battery, or a line card. For controlling entities it may be required to be able to address individual components in order to save energy. For example, server blades can be switched off when the overall load is low or line cards at switches may be powered down at night times.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.3">Identifiers to other devices and to components of devices are already defined in standard MIB modules, such as the LLDP MIB module <a href="#IEEE-802.1AB">[IEEE-802.1AB]</a> and the LLDP-MED MIB module <a href="#ANSI/TIA-1057">[ANSI/TIA-1057]</a> for devices and the Entity MIB module <a href="#RFC4133">[RFC4133]</a> and the Power Ethernet MIB <a href="#RFC3621">[RFC3621]</a> for components of devices. For energy management it is necessary to have means for linking energy-related information to such identifiers.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.4">Instrumentation for measuring energy consumption of a device is typically more expensive than instrumentation for retrieving the devices power state. It may be a reasonable compromise in many cases to provide power state information for all individually switchable components of a device separately, while the energy consumption is only measured for the entire device.</p>

For both AC and DC power the  power quality is also subject of monitoring.  Power quality parameters include the actual voltage, the actual frequency, the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) of voltage and current, the impedance of an AC phase or of the DC supply.

<a href="#rfc.appendix.Appendix%20A">Appendix A.</a> <a href="#standards" id="standards">Existing Standards</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.p.1">This section analyzes existing standards for energy consumption and power state monitoring. It shows that there are already several standards that cover only some part of the requirements listed above, but even all together they do not cover all of the requirements for energy management.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.Appendix A.1">
<a href="#rfc.appendix.Appendix%20A.1">Appendix A.1.</a> Existing IETF Standards</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.1.p.1">There are already RFCs available that address a subset of the requirements.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.Appendix A.1.1">
<a href="#rfc.appendix.Appendix%20A.1.1">Appendix A.1.1.</a> ENTITY MIB</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.1.1.p.1">The ENTITY-MIB module defined in <a href="#RFC4133">[RFC4133]</a> was designed to model physical and logical entities of a managed system.  A physical entity is an identifiable physical component. A logical entity can use one or more physical entities. From an energy monitoring perspective of a managed system, the ENTITY-MIB modeling framework can be reused and whenever <a href="#RFC4133">RFC 4133</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC4133]</cite> has been implemented. The entPhysicalIndex from entPhysicalTable can be used to identify an entity/component. However, there are use cases of energy monitoring, where the application of the ENTITY-MIB does not seem readily apparent and some of those entities could be beyond the original scope and intent of the ENTITY-MIB.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.1.1.p.2">Consider the case of remote devices attached to the network, and the network device could collect the energy measurement and report on behalf of such attached devices. Some of the remote devices such as PoE phones attached to a switch port have been considered in the Power-over-Ethernet MIB module <a href="#RFC3621">[RFC3621]</a>.  However, there are many other devices such as a computer, which draw power from a wall outlet or building HVAC devices which seem to be beyond the original scope of the ENTITY-MIB.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.1.1.p.3">Yet another example, is smart-PDUs, which can report the energy consumption of the device attached to the power outlet of the PDU. In some cases, the device can be attached to multiple to power outlets. Thus, the energy measured at multiple outlets need to be aggregated to determine the consumption of a single device.  From mapping perspective, between the PDU outlets and the device this is a many-to-one mapping. It is not clear if such a many-to-one mapping is feasible within the ENTITY-MIB framework.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.Appendix A.1.2">
<a href="#rfc.appendix.Appendix%20A.1.2">Appendix A.1.2.</a> ENTITY STATE MIB</h1>
<p><a href="#RFC4268">RFC 4268</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC4268]</cite> defines the ENTITY STATE MIB module. Implementations of this module provide information on entities including the standby status (hotStandby, coldStandby, providingService), the operational status (disabled, enabled, testing), the alarm status (underRepair, critical, major, minor, warning), and the usage status (idle, active, busy). This information is already useful as input for policy decisions and for other network management tasks. However, the number of states would cover only a small subset of the requirements for power state monitoring and it does not provide means for energy consumption monitoring.  For associating the information conveyed by the ENTITY STATE MIB to specific components of a device, the ENTITY STATE MIB module makes use of the means provided by the <a href="#RFC4133">ENTITY MIB module</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC4133]</cite>. Particularly, it uses the entPhysicalIndex for identifying entities.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.1.2.p.2">The standby status provided by the ENTITY STATE MIB module is related to power states required for energy management, but the number of states is too restricted for meeting all energy management requirements.  For energy management several more power states are required, such as different sleep and operational states as defined by the <a href="#ACPI.R30b">Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI)</a> <cite title="NONE">[ACPI.R30b]</cite> or the <a href="#DMTF.DSP1027">DMTF Power State Management Profile</a> <cite title="NONE">[DMTF.DSP1027]</cite>.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.Appendix A.1.3">
<a href="#rfc.appendix.Appendix%20A.1.3">Appendix A.1.3.</a> ENTITY SENSOR MIB</h1>
<p><a href="#RFC3433">RFC 3433</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC3433]</cite> defines the ENTITY SENSOR MIB module. Implementations of this module offer a generic way to provide data collected by a sensor. A sensor could be an energy consumption meter delivering measured values in Watt. This could be used for reporting current power of an entity and its components.  Furthermore, the ENTITY SENSOR MIB can be used to retrieve the accuracy of the used power meter.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.1.3.p.2">Similar to the ENTITY STATE MIB module, the ENTITY SENSOR MIB module makes use of the means provided by the <a href="#RFC4133">ENTITY MIB module</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC4133]</cite> for relating provided information to components of a device. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.1.3.p.3">However, there is no unit available for reporting energy quantities, such as, for example, watt seconds or kilowatt hours, and the ENTITY SENSOR MIB module does not support reporting accuracy of measurements according to the IEC / ANSI accuracy classes, which are commonly in use for electric power and energy measurements. The ENTITY SENSOR MIB modules only provides a coarse-grained method for indicating accuracy by stating the number of correct digits of fixed point values.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.Appendix A.1.4">
<a href="#rfc.appendix.Appendix%20A.1.4">Appendix A.1.4.</a> UPS MIB</h1>
<p><a href="#RFC1628">RFC 1628</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC1628]</cite> defines the UPS MIB module. Implementations of this module provide information on the current real power of entities attached to an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) device. This application would require identifying which entity is attached to which port of the UPS device.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.1.4.p.2">UPS MIB provides information on the state of the UPS network.  The MIB module contains several variables that are used to identify the UPS entity (name, model,..), the battery state, to characterize the input load to the UPS, to characterize the output from the UPS, to indicate the various alarm events.  The measurements of power in UPS MIB are in Volts, Amperes and Watts.  The units of power measurement are RMS volts, RMS Amperes and are not based on Entity-Sensor MIB [RFC3433].</p>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.Appendix A.1.5">
<a href="#rfc.appendix.Appendix%20A.1.5">Appendix A.1.5.</a> POWER ETHERNET MIB</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.1.5.p.1">Similar to the UPS MIB, implementations of the POWER ETHERNET MIB module defined in <a href="#RFC3621">RFC3621</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC3621]</cite> provide information on the current energy consumption of the entities that receive Power over Ethernet (PoE). This information can be retrieved at the power sourcing equipment. Analogous to the UPS MIB, it is required to identify which entities are attached to which port of the power sourcing equipment.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.1.5.p.2">The  POWER ETHERNET MIB does not report power and energy consumption on a per port basis, but can report aggregated values for groups of ports. It does not use objects of the ENTITY MIB module for identifying entities, although this module existed already when the POWER ETHERNET MIB modules was standardized.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.Appendix A.1.6">
<a href="#rfc.appendix.Appendix%20A.1.6">Appendix A.1.6.</a> LLDP MED MIB</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.1.6.p.1">The Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) defined in IEEE 802.1AB <a href="#IEEE-802.1AB">[IEEE-802.1AB]</a> is a data link layer protocol used by network devices for advertising of their identities, capabilities, and interconnections on a LAN network.  The Media Endpoint Discovery (MED) is an enhancement of LLDP known as LLDP-MED <a href="#ANSI/TIA-1057">[ANSI/TIA-1057]</a>.  The LLDP-MED enhancements specifically address voice applications.  LLDP-MED covers 6 basic areas: capabilities discovery, LAN speed and duplex discovery, network policy discovery, location identification discovery, inventory discovery, and power discovery.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.Appendix A.2">
<a href="#rfc.appendix.Appendix%20A.2">Appendix A.2.</a> Existing standards of other bodies</h1>
<p></p>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.Appendix A.2.1">
<a href="#rfc.appendix.Appendix%20A.2.1">Appendix A.2.1.</a> DMTF</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.2.1.p.1">The DMTF has defined a <a href="#DMTF.DSP1027">power state management profile</a> <cite title="NONE">[DMTF.DSP1027]</cite> that is targeted at computer systems.  It is based on the DMTF's Common Information Model (CIM) and it is rather an entity profile than an actual energy consumption monitoring standard.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.2.1.p.2">The power state management profile is used to describe and to manage the power state of computer systems. This includes e.g. means to change the power state of an entity (e.g. to shutdown the entity) which is an aspect of but not sufficient for active energy management.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.Appendix A.2.2">
<a href="#rfc.appendix.Appendix%20A.2.2">Appendix A.2.2.</a> OVDA</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.2.2.p.1">ODVA is an association consisting of members from industrial automation companies. ODVA  supports standardization of network technologies based on the Common Industrial Protocol (CIP). Within ODVA, there is a special interest group focused on energy and standardization and inter-operability of energy aware entities. </p>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.Appendix A.2.3">
<a href="#rfc.appendix.Appendix%20A.2.3">Appendix A.2.3.</a> IEEE-ISTO Printer WG</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.2.3.p.1">The charter of the IEEE-ISTO Printer Working Group is for open standards that define printer related protocols, that printer manufacturers and related software vendors shall benefit from the interoperability provided by conformance to these standards.  One particular aspect the Printer WG is focused on is power monitoring and management of network printers and imaging systems <a href="#IEEE-ISTO">PWG Power Management Model for Imaging Systems </a> <cite title="NONE">[IEEE-ISTO]</cite>.  Clearly, these devices are within the scope of energy management since these devices consume power and are attached to the network. In addition, there is ample scope of power management since printers and imaging systems are not used that often.  IEEE-ISTO Printer working group has defined MIB modules for monitoring the power consumption and power state series that can be useful for power management of printers. The energy management framework should also take into account the standards defined in the Printer working group.  In terms of other standards, IETF Printer MIB <a href="#RFC3805">RFC3805</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC3805]</cite> has been standardized, however, this MIB module does not address power management of printers. </p>
