Abstract

    This document is a checklist to verify the completeness of Entity
    MIB (Version 2)[RFC2737] agent and manager implementations based on
    RFC 2737.  This document will be used to gather and evaluate
    implementation experience in an effort to determine whether RFC 2737
    is ready to advance to Draft Standard.

                  Entity MIB Implementation Checklist         May 2001

Agent Implementation Checklist

    This section should be completed by individuals or companies who
    have implemented RFC 2737 support in an SNMP agent.

    Is your Entity MIB agent an independent implementation?  Or is it
    based on public domain or commercial code?  If it is not
    independent, what code base was used?

    Have you done any interoperability testing with managers that
    implement the Entity MIB?  If so, which manager implementations have
    been used with your agent?

    For each manager with which you have interoperated, which of the
    following features were tested? Duplicate this section for each
    manager, and indicate yes or no (Y/N) for each feature:

    Manager Implementation Used: <Name>
    Original Manager Code Base (if known):  <Name>
    (Y/N) Manager implemented independently from your agent?
    (Y/N) Read access to Entity MIB variables.
    (Y/N) Write access to Entity MIB variables.
    (Y/N) Sending and receiving Entity MIB notifications.
    (Y/N) Tested using SNMPv1/v2c.
    (Y/N) Tested using SNMPv3.

    Are there any unresolved interoperability issues between your Entity
    MIB agent and any Entity MIB manager that may indicate problems in
    the specification?  If so, please provide technical details.

    Does your implementation support the following textual conventions,
    including the updates and changes since RFC 2037?

    (Y/N) Supports PhysicalIndex TC.
    (Y/N) Supports updated PhysicalClass TC.
    (Y/N)        Uses new "stack(11)" enumeration.
    (List)       Please list the PhysicalClass values suported by your
                 implementation:
    (Y/N) Supports new SNMPEngineIDorNone TC.
    (Y/N)        Does your agent support SNMPv3?

    Does your Entity MIB agent implement the following groups and
    objects?  Indicate yes or no (Y or N) for each group and object:

    (Y/N) entityPhysical Group
    (Y/N)        entPhysicalIndex
    (Y/N)        entPhysicalDescr

    read-write objects?  Indicate yes or no (Y or N) for each object:

    (Y/N) entPhysicalSerialNum
    (Y/N) entPhysicalAlias
    (Y/N) entPhysicalAssetID

    Does your implementation include each of the following
    notifications?  Indicate yes or no (Y or N) for each notification:

Manager Implementation Checklist

    This section should be completed by individuals or companies who
    have implemented RFC 2737 support in an SNMP manager.  Companies
    that have implemented both an agent and a manager should complete
    both the agent and manager sections of this checklist.

    Is your Entity MIB manager an independent implementation?  Or is it
    based on public domain or commercial code?  If it is not
    independent, what code base was used?

    Have you done any interoperability testing with agents that
    implement the Entity MIB?  If so, which agent implementations have
    been used with your manager?

    For each agent with which you have interoperated, which of the
    following features were tested? Duplicate this section for each
    agent, and indicate yes or no (Y/N) for each feature:

    Agent Implementation Used: <Name>
    Original Code Base (if known):  <Name>
    (Y/N) Agent implemented independently from your manager?
    (Y/N) Read access to Entity MIB variables.
    (Y/N) Write access to Entity MIB variables.
    (Y/N) Sending and receiving Entity MIB notifications.
    (Y/N) Tested using SNMPv1/v2c.
    (Y/N) Tested using SNMPv3.

    Are there any unresolved interoperability issues between your Entity
    MIB manager and any Entity MIB agent that may indicate problems in
    the specification?  If so, please provide technical details.

    Does your implementation support the following textual conventions,
    including the updates and changes since RFC 2037?

    (Y/N) Supports PhysicalIndex TC.
    (Y/N) Supports updated PhysicalClass TC.
    (Y/N)        Displays names of enumerated types, including
                 stack(11).
    (Y/N) Supports new SNMPEngineIDorNone TC.
    (Y/N)        Does your manager support SNMPv3?

    Is your Entity MIB manager able to get and display the following
    groups and objects?  Indicate yes or no (Y or N) for each group and
    object:

    (Y/N) entityPhysical Group
    (Y/N)        entPhysicalIndex
    (Y/N)        entPhysicalDescr
    (Y/N)        entPhysicalVendorType

    Is your manager capable of writing to the following read-write
    objects?  Indicate yes or no (Y or N) for each object:

    (Y/N) entPhysicalSerialNum
    (Y/N) entPhysicalAlias
    (Y/N) entPhysicalAssetID

Security Considerations

    This document is a checklist that can be used to determine the
    completeness of an RFC 2737 implementation.  It does not specify a
    protocol, discusses no security issues and has no special security
    considerations.
