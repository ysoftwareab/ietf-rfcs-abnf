                  IMAP Paged SEARCH & FETCH Extension
                     draft-melnikov-imap-partial-00

Abstract

   The PARTIAL extension of the Internet Message Access Protocol (RFC
   3501/RFC 9051) allows clients to limit the number of search results
   returned, as well as to perform incremental (paged) searches.  This
   also helps servers to optimize resource usage when performing
   searches.

   This document extends PARTIAL SEARCH return option originally
   specified in RFC 5267.  It also clarifies some interactions between
   RFC 5267 and RFC 4731/RFC 9051.

1.  Introduction and Overview

   This document defines an extension to the Internet Message Access
   Protocol [RFC3501] for performing incremental searches and fetches.
   This extension is compatible with both IMAP4rev1 [RFC3501] and
   IMAP4rev2 [RFC9051].

Internet-Draft                IMAP PARTIAL                  October 2021


   The PARTIAL extension of the Internet Message Access Protocol (RFC
   3501/RFC 9051) allows clients to limit the number of search results
   returned, as well as to perform incremental (paged) searches.  This
   also helps servers to optimize resource usage when performing
   searches.

   This document extends PARTIAL SEARCH return option originally
   specified in RFC 5267.

2.  Document Conventions

   In protocol examples, this document uses a prefix of "C: " to denote
   lines sent by the client to the server, and "S: " for lines sent by
   the server to the client.  Lines prefixed with "// " are comments
   explaining the previous protocol line.  These prefixes and comments
   are not part of the protocol.  Lines without any of these prefixes
   are continuations of the previous line, and no line break is present
   in the protocol unless specifically mentioned.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Other capitalised words are IMAP keywords [RFC3501][RFC9051] or
   keywords from this document.

3.  Incremental SEARCH and partial results

   The PARTIAL search return option causes the server to provide in an
   ESEARCH response a subset of the results denoted by the sequence
   range given as the mandatory argument.  The first result (message
   with the lowest matching UID) is 1; thus, the first 500 results would
   be obtained by a return option of "PARTIAL 1:500", and the second 500
   by "PARTIAL 501:1000".  This intentionally mirrors message sequence
   numbers.

   It is also possible to direct the server to start SEARCH from the
   latest matching (with the highest UID) message.  This can be done by
   prepeding "-" to the index.  For example -1 is the last message, -2
   is next to the last and so on.  Using this syntax helps server
   implementations to optimize their SEARCHes.

   A single command MUST NOT contain more than one PARTIAL or ALL search
   return option -- that is, either one PARTIAL, one ALL, or neither
   PARTIAL nor ALL is allowed.

Internet-Draft                IMAP PARTIAL                  October 2021


   For SEARCH results, the entire result list MUST be ordered in mailbox
   order, that is, in UID or message sequence number order.

   Where a PARTIAL search return option references results that do not
   exist, by using a range which starts or ends higher (or lower) than
   the current number of results, then the server returns the results
   that are in the set.  This yields a PARTIAL return data item that
   has, as payload, the original range and a potentially missing set of
   results that may be shorter than the extent of the range.  If the
   whole range references results that do not exist, a special value
   "NIL" is returned by the server instead of the sequence set.

   Clients need not request PARTIAL results in any particular order.
   Because mailboxes may change, clients might wish to use PARTIAL in
   combination with UPDATE (see [RFC5267] if the server also advertises
   CONTEXT=SEARCH capability, especially if the intent is to walk a
   large set of results; however, these return options do not interact
   -- the UPDATE will provide notifications for all matching results.

     // Let's assume that the A01 SEARCH without PARTIAL would return
     // 23764 results.
     C: A01 UID SEARCH RETURN (PARTIAL -1:-100) UNDELETED
       UNKEYWORD $Junk
     S: * ESEARCH (TAG "A01") UID PARTIAL (-1:-100 ...)
     // 100 most recent results in set syntax elided.
     S: A01 OK Completed.

     // Let's assume that the A02 SEARCH without PARTIAL would return
     // 23764 results.
     C: A02 UID SEARCH RETURN (PARTIAL 23500:24000) UNDELETED
       UNKEYWORD $Junk
     C: A03 UID SEARCH RETURN (PARTIAL 1:500) UNDELETED
       UNKEYWORD $Junk
     C: A04 UID SEARCH RETURN (PARTIAL 24000:24500) UNDELETED
       UNKEYWORD $Junk
     S: * ESEARCH (TAG "A02") UID PARTIAL (23500:24000 ...)
     // 264 results in set syntax elided,
     // this spans the end of the results.
     S: A02 OK Completed.
     S: * ESEARCH (TAG "A03") UID PARTIAL (1:500 ...)
     // 500 results in set syntax elided.
     S: A03 OK Completed.
     S: * ESEARCH (TAG "A04") UID PARTIAL (24000:24500 NIL)
     // No results are present, this is beyond the end of the results.
     S: A04 OK Completed.

4.  Interaction between PARTIAL, MIN, MAX and SAVE SEARCH return options

   This section only applies if the server advertises PARTIAL IMAP
   capability or CONTEXT=SEARCH [RFC5267], together with ESEARCH
   [RFC4731] and/or IMAP4rev2"[RFC9051].

   The SAVE result option doesn't change whether the server would return
   items corresponding to PARTIAL SEARCH result options.

   As specified in Section 3, it is an error to specify both PARTIAL and
   ALL result options in the same SEARCH command.

   When the SAVE result option is combined with the PARTIAL result
   option, and none of MIN/MAX/COUNT result options is present, the
   corresponding PARTIAL is returned, and the "$" marker would contain
   all messages returned by the PARTIAL result option.

   When the SAVE + PARTIAL result options are combined with the MIN or
   the MAX result option, and the COUNT result option is absent, the
   corresponding PARTIAL result and MIN/MAX is returned (if the search
   result is not empty), and the "$" marker would contain all messages
   returned by the PARTIAL result option + the corresponding MIN/MAX
   message.

   If the SAVE + PARTIAL result options are combined with both MIN and
   MAX result options, and the COUNT result options is absent, the
   PARTIAL, MIN and MAX are returned (if the search result is not
   empty), and the "$" marker would contain all messages returned by the
   PARTIAL result option plus MIN and MAX messages.

   If the SAVE + PARTIAL result options are combined with the COUNT
   result option, the PARTIAL and COUNT are returned, and the "$" marker
   would always contain all messages found by the SEARCH or UID SEARCH
   command.

   The following table summarizes the additional requirement on ESEARCH
   server implementations described in this section.

          +==============================+=====================+
          | Combination of Result option |   "$" marker value  |
          +==============================+=====================+
          |         SAVE PARTIAL         |       PARTIAL       |
          +------------------------------+---------------------+
          |       SAVE PARTIAL MIN       |    PARTIAL & MIN    |
          +------------------------------+---------------------+
          |       SAVE PARTIAL MAX       |    PARTIAL & MAX    |
          +------------------------------+---------------------+
          |     SAVE PARTIAL MIN MAX     | PARTIAL & MIN & MAX |

5.  Extension to FETCH

   The PARTIAL extension also extends the FETCH command with a PARTIAL
   FETCH modifier.  The PARTIAL FETCH modifier has the same syntax as
   the PARTIAL SEARCH result option.  Presence of the PARTIAL FETCH
   modifier instructs the server to only return FETCH results for
   messages in the specified range.  It is useful when the sequence-set
   (first) parameter to FETCH/UID FETCH command includes unknown number
   of messages.

     // Returning information for the last 3 messages in the UID range
     C: 10 UID FETCH 25900:26600 (UID FLAGS) (PARTIAL -1:-3)
     S: * 12888 FETCH (FLAGS (\Seen) UID 25996)
     S: * 12889 FETCH (FLAGS (\Flagged \Answered) UID 25997)
     S: * 12890 FETCH (FLAGS () UID 26600)
     S: 10 OK FETCH completed

     // Returning information for the first 5 messages in the UID range
     C: 11 UID FETCH 25900:26600 (UID FLAGS) (PARTIAL 1:5)
     S: * 12591 FETCH (FLAGS (\Seen) UID 25900)
     S: * 12592 FETCH (FLAGS (\Flagged) UID 25902)
     S: * 12593 FETCH (FLAGS (\Answered) UID 26310)
     S: * 12594 FETCH (FLAGS () UID 26311)
     S: * 12595 FETCH (FLAGS (\Answered) UID 26498)
     S: 11 OK FETCH completed

6.  Expressing limits on a number of messages used in
    SEARCH/FETCH/STORE/COPY/MOVE


   // Should this be a separate IMAP capability?
   // Also, should this also affect SEARCH?  If yes, do we need a way to
   // specify SEARCH criterion for "all UIDs after" or "all UIDs before"
   // a specific UID?

   If a server implementation doesn't allow more than <N> messages to be
   operated on by a single FETCH/STORE/COPY/MOVE command, it MUST return
   the MESSAGELIMIT response code defined below:

   MESSAGELIMIT  The server doesn't allow more than <N> messages to be operated

         on by a single SEARCH/FETCH/STORE/COPY/MOVE command.  The last
         processed UID is <LastUID>.  The client needs to repeat the
         operation for remaining messages.

 
           C: 03 FETCH 10000:14589 (UID FLAGS)
           S: * 14589 FETCH (FLAGS (\Seen) UID 25000)
           S: * 14588 FETCH (FLAGS (\Answered) UID 24998)
           S: ... further 997 fetch responses
           S: * 13590 FETCH (FLAGS () UID 23221)
           S: 03 OK [MESSAGELIMIT 1000 23221] FETCH completed with 1000 partial
               results

         In the above example the <N> value is 1000 and the last
         processed UID <LastUID> is 23221.

7.  Formal syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (ABNF) notation as specified in [ABNF].

   Non-terminals referenced but not defined below are as defined by
   IMAP4 [RFC3501].

   Except as noted otherwise, all alphabetic characters are case-
   insensitive.  The use of upper or lower case characters to define
   token strings is for editorial clarity only.  Implementations MUST
   accept these strings in a case-insensitive fashion.


   SP                  = <Defined in RFC 5234>
   MINUS               = "-"

   capability          =/ "PARTIAL"
                          ;; <capability> from [RFC3501]

   modifier-partial    = "PARTIAL" SP partial-range

   partial-range-first = nz-number ":" nz-number
       ;; Request to search from oldest (lowest UIDs) to
       ;; more recent messages.
       ;; A range 500:400 is the same as 400:500.
       ;; This is similar to <seq-range> from [RFC3501],
       ;; but cannot contain "*".

   partial-range-last  = MINUS nz-number ":" MINUS nz-number
       ;; Request to search from newest (highest UIDs) to
       ;; oldest messages.

       ;; A range -500:-400 is the same as -400:-500.

   partial-range       = partial-range-first / partial-range-last

   search-return-opt   =/ modifier-partial
       ;; All conform to <search-return-opt>, from [IMAP-ABNF]/[RFC9051]

   search-return-data  =/ ret-data-partial

   ret-data-partial    = "PARTIAL"
                         SP "(" partial-range SP partial-results ")"
       ;; <partial-range> is the requested range.

   partial-results     = sequence-set / "NIL"
       ;; <sequence-set> from [RFC3501].
       ;; NIL indicates no results correspond to the requested range.

   tagged-ext-simple   =/ partial-range-last



   fetch-modifier      =/ modifier-partial

       ;; No more than nz-number messages can be processed
       ;; by any command at a time. The last processed
       ;; UID is uniqueid.

8.  Security Considerations

   TBD.

9.  IANA Considerations

9.1.  Changes/additions to the IMAP4 capabilities registry

   IMAP4 capabilities are registered by publishing a standards track or
   IESG approved Informational or Experimental RFC.  The registry is
   currently located at:

      https://www.iana.org/assignments/imap4-capabilities

   IANA is requested to add definition of the PARTIAL extension to point
   to this document.
