1.  Introduction

   In 2004-2005, work was initiated on a Modular Cable Modem Termination
   System (M-CMTS) architecture at CableLabs.  A number of
   specifications were published under the M-CMTS effort, including the
   Edge Resource Manager Interface Specification [ERMI].  The current
   version of [ERMI] is numbered I02, and it relies on RTSP for
   requesting and allocating resources internal to cable systems.  An
   update to ERMI version 2 is planned in the near future that will
   incorporate some of the feedback already received from IETF and add
   new RTSP extensions; those new extensions will be integrated in
   future revisions of this document.

   A block diagram of the architecture relevant to the ERMI
   specification and its use of the RTSP protocol is shown on Figure 1.
   DOCSIS(tm) stands for Data-Over-Cable-Service-Interface
   Specifications.  The cable head-end architecture centers on DOCSIS
   CMTS systems that send Video and Internet data to subscribers.
   An Edge QAM (EQAM) is a head-end or hub device that receives packets
   of digital video or data from the operator network.  It re-packetizes
   the video or data into an MPEG transport stream and digitally
   modulates the transport stream onto a downstream RF carrier using
   Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM).
   A CMTS requires resources (such as EQAMs) to relay this data to
   subscriber modems.  These resources are allocated by an Edge Resource
   Manager (ERM).

   The CMTS and EQAMs use the Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP,
   [RFC2326]), as defined in the CableLabs Edge Resource Manager
   Interface Specification ([ERMI]) during the resource allocation
   process.  The CMTS asks the Edge Resource Manager for an EQAM, the
   ERM confers with the EQAMs, and then gives the CMTS the appropriate
   EQAM resource.
   It should be noted that the choice of RTSP as a protocol for edge
   resource management was done historically by product vendors and
   operators based on the basic needs to setup and tear down sessions
   for media that has similar realtime, multimedia properties as the
   typical media established using RTSP.

        RTSP Usage in Edge Resource Manager Interface Specification

                                 Figure 1

   The M-CMTS core, the ERM, and the EQAM use TCP as the transport-layer
   protocol and listen on TCP port 554 for incoming RTSP connections.
   The M-CMTS core acts as an RTSP client.  The ERM plays the role of an
   RTSP client and an RTSP server.  The EQAM acts as an RTSP server.
   The RTSP SETUP, TEARDOWN, SET_PARAMETER and GET_PARAMETER methods
   must at a minimum be supported by M-CMTS, ERM and EQAM.  In addition,
   the M-CMTS core and the ERM must also support the ANNOUNCE method.
   A session keepalive method named PING was defined as part of the ERMI
   specification version I02.  Its use has been deprecated and the
   keepalive mechanism now relies on the SET_PARAMETER method.

   The ERMI specification makes extensions to RTSP [RFC2326] to add
   EQAM-specific parameters.  The applicability of these ERMI RTSP
   messages is within the internal system architecture of a DOCSIS
   M-CMTS system and within a DOCSIS cable network.  This is done by
   enforcing RTSP clients to insert the RTSP Require header with a
   specific extension tag.  The option tag and its associated extensions
   are briefly discussed in Section 2.1.

2.  ERMI extensions to RTSP

2.1.  List of ERMI extensions

   Section 7 of the [ERMI] specification outlines the relevant
   extensions.  These extensions are briefly summarized here.  It is
   recommended that the reader reviews the referenced CableLabs
   specification for more details.

   The following extensions to RTSP have been used in ERMI version I02:

   o    New parameters for the Transport header:
        Section 12.39 of [RFC2326] specifies the Transport header.  ERMI
        Extensions to the Transport header identify parameters
        associated with the transport of the media stream through an
        EQAM.
        Transport headers take the form of:
        Transport: <transport-spec> [, <transport-spec>].
        Each <transport-spec> takes the form: DOCSIS/QAM; unicast.  The
        bit rate, QAM ID and DEPI mode are passed as part of the
        transport header with additional optional values.
        In an upcoming revision of ERMI, the <transport-spec> will be of
        the form: clab-DOCSIS/QAM and optional field values will be more
        precisely defined.

   o    New DOCSIS-Notice header:
        The DOCSIS-Notice header header provides information sent from
        an RTSP server to a client in an ANNOUNCE request, specifically
        to reclaim an ERMI session.
        The syntax of the DOCSIS-Notice header is:
        DOCSIS-Notice: <notice-code>
        The RTSP client and server must support the values of notice-
        code and code-description defined in the ERMI specification.
        Currently, only the value of '5701' is define to reclaim a
        session.
        In an upcoming revision of ERMI, this header will be renamed
        clab-DOCSIS-Notice.

   o    New RTSP option tag in the Require header:
        The Require: header must be present in RTSP requests methods,
        with the newly defined 'ermi' tag (see IANA consideration
        section).
        In an upcoming revision of ERMI, a new option tag is defined as
        'com.cablelabs.ermi'.

   o    New parameters for GET_PARAMETER method:
        The RTSP GET_PARAMETER method is used by the client to obtain
        the list of active RTSP sessions that were initiated by the

        client before the current TCP connection was established.  It is
        used by a client as a mechanism to synchronize its session state
        with the RTSP server following a client reboot.

2.2.  Limited Applicability of RTSP ERMI extensions

   There are several considerations to the ERMI RTSP extensions.

   First, the ERMI specification is intended to be used within a single
   cable administrative domain, a 'closed' cable system head-end with
   controlled network and administrative domains.  It is unlikely that
   the [ERMI] protocols will escape these domains as the ERMI traffic is
   considered as a service control and management.

   Secondly, the ERMI specification requires that RTSP requests include
   the Require Header with a specific option tag.  Section 12.32 of
   [RFC2326] requires a non-ERMI server to reject this ERMI option tag
   header as Unsupported.

3.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document also reuses the terminology defined in [ERMI] and it is
   recommended for the reader to read the ERMI specification.

4.  IANA Considerations

   The CableLabs ERMI specification currently makes use of a new option
   tag indicating support for the ERMI RTSP requirements; this option
   tag means that the various extensions (Transport, clab-Notice-header
   header, etc.) are supported.

   As the RTSP usage in ERMI matures, this document will request IANA to
   register an option tag and associated header and field values.

   For example, a new option tag will be defined as described in section
   3.8.1 of [RFC2326]:

   o    Name and description of option:
        The name of this new option is 'com.cablelabs.ermi'. //todo:
        This text should explicitly define what is required to be
        supposed to claim compliance with this new option tag.

   o    Change of control: CableLabs

   o    Reference: [ERMI]
