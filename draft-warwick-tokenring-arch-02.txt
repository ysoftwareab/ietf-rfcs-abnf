Internet Draft DTR Concentrator MIB                        November 1997


Abstract

   This document  contains  an  extract from the approved text of IEEE
   standard 802.5R ''Dedicated Token Ring''.   The  extract  comprises
   the  MIB for the Dedicated Token Ring Concentrator, in SNMPv2 format.
   The changes from the previous version of this draft are small but
   important, and are in the area of CRF creation, where a RowStatus
   mechanism replaces the previous way of creating CRFs.

   802.5R  is a standard that encompasses the existing 802.5 token-
   passing method of operation, and also defines a new duplex method of
   operation for use only on dedicated point to point links, that does
   not use tokens for data transmission.

   The architecture of a DTR  Concentrator is defined in the 802.5R
   standard.  It  is a MAC layer bridging device, which uses a new set
   of forwarding rules that  ease interoperability between source
   routing and transparent bridging in an  802.5  LAN.  The DTR
   Concentrator MIB is derived from the Source Routing and Transparent
   Bridge MIBs  (RFCs 1525 and 1493).

Background

   In the  past,  SNMP  MIBs  for  IEEE  802 standards have been written
   by members  of  the  IETF Network Management Working Group, on the
   basis of GDMO  management  information  in  the  IEEE document.
   However, in this case, the draft IEEE 802.5R standard contains its
   management information in SNMP MIB format.

Brief Introduction to Dedicated Token Ring

   The operation of Dedicated Token Ring (DTR) involves communication
   between two distinct entities. These are the DTR Station, and the DTR
   Concentrator Port (C-Port). A DTR link consists of one DTR Station
   and one C-Port. To provide links between DTR Concentrators, a C-Port
   may act as a DTR Station (C-Port in Station Emulation Mode).

   When operating  as  a dedicated link, there is no token passing, and
   the Transmit Immediate (TXI) function is used to transmit data.

   In addition, DTR Stations and C-Ports are required to be able to
   support token-passing (TKP) operation, also referred to as Classic
   Token Ring operation.

   Stations and C-Ports will automatically detect the appropriate access
   protocol to use when they are enabled.

   In summary, DTR provides a way of connecting a Station to a

   Concentrator on a dedicated link with an aggregate throughput of 32
   MBits/sec, and also provides backwards compatibility with shared
   media token passing operation at 16 or 4 MBits/sec.

   A DTR Concentrator may provide a MAC layer relay service between any
   mixture of DTR links and Classic 802.5 rings.

Internet Draft DTR Concentrator MIB                        November 1997


        DESCRIPTION
             " The MIB Module for DTR Concentrators. "
        ::= { ieee8025dtr 2 }

ieee8025        OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { enterprises 2043 }

--*************************************************************
--  This SNMP MIB Module contains definitions for management
--  of a DTR Concentrator.  The MIB consists of the following
--  groups:
-- 1. Base DTR Concentrator Information              (mandatory)
-- 2. DTR  Concentrator Spanning Tree Information     (optional)
-- 3. DTR  Concentrator Forwarding Information        (optional)
-- 4. DTR  Concentrator MRI Information               (optional)
-- 5. DTR  Concentrator Statistics Information        (optional)
--*************************************************************

--  Relationship to RFC1493
--      RFC1493 is not used for management of any CRF object.
--      However, if a Bridge Relay Function is defined for the
--      DTR Concentrator, the Bridge MIB is used for the Bridge
--      Relay Function.

--  Relationship to RFC1573

--  Layering Model
--      This MIB describes the Concentrator Relay Function (CRF)
--      which forwards frames based on addressing and other
--      information extracted from a received "lower layer" data
--      frame.  For the purposes of RFC1573, the CRF forwards
--      frames by building an "upper layer" protocol "logical
--      entity" used to connect several physical C-Ports to an
--      optional internal Bridge Relay Function interface.  The
--      same CRF can be defined as the "upper layer" for multiple
--      interfaces.  A given C-Port or internal Bridge Relay
--      Function interface provides data to only a single CRF.

--  Virtual Circuits
--      The CRF does not support virtual circuits.

Internet Draft DTR Concentrator MIB                        November 1997


--  ifTestTable
--      The CRF does not implement tests via SNMP.

--  ifRcvAddressTable
--      For interfaces that correspond to a C-Port:  The C-Port
--      operates in promiscuous mode, hence this table contains
--      only the all station broadcast address, the functional
--      address bit mask (if any are enabled), and the C-Port
--      individual address.  Note that MAC traffic targeted
--      to this C-Port entry is not forwarded to the CRF.
--      Bridge Relay Function interfaces are not implemented
--      in this table.

--  ifType
--      Additional IANAifType enumerated values are required for
--      this MIB. These enumerated values correspond to the
--      following:
--          1. C-Port Interface (86).
--          2. Internal Bridge Relay Function interface (98).
--      This MIB maps dtrCRFPortType to ifType in RFC1573.
