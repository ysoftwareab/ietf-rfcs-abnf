HELD-URI = "helds://" host [ ":" port ] [ path-absolute ] [ "?" query ]





   The following summarizes the primary elements comprising the HELD-
   URI:

   host:  As defined in RFC3986 [RFC3986]
   port:  As defined in RFC3986 [RFC3986].  There is no unique port
      associated with location URIs.
   path-absolute  As defined in RFC3986 [RFC3986].
   query:  As defined in RFC3986 [RFC3986].  This allows for additional
      information associated with the URIs such as a unique anonymous
      identifier for the Device associated with the target location.

   The helds: URI is not intended to be human-readable text, therefore
   it is encoded entirely in US-ASCII.  The following are examples of
   helds: URIs:


     helds://ls.example.com:49152/thisLocation?token=xyz987
     helds://ls.example.com:5432/THISLOCATION?foobar=abc123
     helds://ls.example.com:5432/THISlocation?foobar=ABC123
     helds://ls.example.com:9876/civic


   Other than the "host" portion, URIs are case sensitive and exact
   equivalency is required for HELD-URI comparisons.  For example, in
   the above examples, although similar in information, the 2nd and 3rd
   URIs are not considered equivalent.

   In the case where the helds: URI is contained in a "locationURI"
   element in a HELD locationResponse message, it is important to note
   that the URI is only valid for the length of time indicated by the
   "expires" attribute.
