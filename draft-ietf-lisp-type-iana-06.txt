   LISP Shared Extension Message & IANA Registry for LISP Packet Type
                              Allocations
                      draft-ietf-lisp-type-iana-06

Abstract

   This document defines a registry for Locator/ID Separation Protocol
   (LISP) Packet Type allocations.  It also specifies a LISP shared
   message type for defining future extensions and conducting
   experiments without consuming a LISP packet type codepoint for each
   extension.

   This document updates RFC6830 by defining a registry for LISP Packet
   Types assignments.

1.  Introduction

   The Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP, [RFC6830]) base
   specification defines a set of primitives that are identified with a
   packet type code.  Several extensions have been proposed to add more
   LISP functionalities.  For example, new message types are proposed in
   [I-D.ietf-lisp-ddt], [I-D.zhao-lisp-mn-extension],
   [I-D.boucadair-lisp-bulk], [I-D.ermagan-lisp-nat-traversal], or
   [I-D.boucadair-lisp-subscribe].  It is expected that additional LISP
   extensions will be proposed in the future.

   In order to ease the tracking of LISP message types, this document
   proposes to create a "LISP Packet Types" IANA registry (see
   Section 4).

   Because of the limited type space [RFC6830] and the need to conduct
   experiments to assess new LISP extensions, this document specifies a
   shared LISP extension message type and proposes a procedure for
   registering LISP shared extension sub-types (see Section 2).

   Concretely, one single LISP message type code is dedicated to future
   LISP extensions; sub-types are used to uniquely identify a given LISP
   extension making use of the shared LISP extension message type.
   These identifiers are selected by the author(s) of the corresponding
   LISP specification that introduces a new LISP extension message type.

2.  LISP Shared Extension Message Type

   Figure 1 depicts the common format of the LISP shared extension
   message.  The type field MUST be set to 15 (see Section 4).

        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |Type=15|        Sub-type       |   extension-specific          |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       //                    extension-specific                       //
       //                                                             //
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

               Figure 1: LISP Shared Extension Message Type

   The "Sub-type" field conveys a unique identifier that MUST be
   registered with IANA (see Section 4.2).

   The exact structure of the 'extension-specific' portion of the
   message is specified in the corresponding specification document.

3.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any additional security issues other
   than those discussed in [RFC6830].

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  LISP Packet Types

   IANA is requested to create a new protocol registry for LISP Packet
   Types, numbered 0-15.  The registry must be initially populated with
   the following values:

   Message                           Code    Reference
   ================================= ==== ===============
   Reserved                           0      [RFC6830]
   LISP Map-Request                   1      [RFC6830]
   LISP Map-Reply                     2      [RFC6830]
   LISP Map-Register                  3      [RFC6830]
   LISP Map-Notify                    4      [RFC6830]
   LISP Encapsulated Control Message  8      [RFC6830]
   LISP Shared Extension Message     15   [This document]

   The values in the ranges 5-7 and 9-14 can be assigned via Standards
   Action [RFC5226].  Documents that request for a new LISP packet type
   may indicate a preferred value in the corresponding IANA sections.

4.2.  Sub-Types

   IANA is requested to create a "LISP Shared Extension Message type
   Sub-types" registry.  No initial values are assigned at the creation
   of the registry; (0-4095) are available for future assignments.

   The values in the range 0-1023 are assigned via Standards Action.
   This range is provisioned to anticipate, in particular, the
   exhaustion of the LISP Packet types.

   The values in 1024-4095 are assigned on a First Come, First Served
   (FCFS) basis.  The registration procedure should provide IANA with
   the desired codepoint and a point of contact.  Providing a short
   description (together with an acronym, if relevant) of the foreseen
   usage of the extension message is also encouraged.
