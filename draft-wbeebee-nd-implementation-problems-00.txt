Internet-Draft      Known ND Implementation Problems      September 2007


1.  Introduction

   This document catalogs a number of known IPv6 ND implementation
   problems.  The goal in doing so is to enhance the quality of current
   IPv6 ND implementations.  It is hoped that this will provide greater
   interoperability between IPv6 ND implementations.  Each problem
   description is modelled after the problem description format from
   section 1 of RFC 2525 [TCPProb].


2.  Known IPv6 ND Implementation Problems

2.1.  Incorrect host data forwarding behavior after receiving an RA with
      no Prefix Information Option (PIO)

   Name of problem  Incorrect host data forwarding behavior after
           receiving an RA with no PIO.




   Classification  Potential network connectivity loss.




   Description  An IPv6 host has received an RA with M bit set and no
           PIO.  Since no on-link information was provided, the host has
           to assume all non-link-local destinations are off-link and
           send all non-link-local traffic to the default router and
           allow the router to issue any Redirects if necessary.  The
           host completes DHCPv6 and then, when the host is asked to
           ping an address, the host issues an NS to resolve the ping
           destination address instead of forwarding the ping packet to
           the default router.




   Significance  An IPv6 default router for this source host and the
           destination host may not respond to the address resolution NS
           sent out by the source host when asked to ping a destination,
           and the source host may lose IPv6 network connectivity as a
           result.

Internet-Draft      Known ND Implementation Problems      September 2007





   Implications  If the router and the destination host do not respond
           to the NS, the host layer 2 driver will hold the IPv6 packet,
           resulting in lack of IPv6 connectivity as per section 4.2.5
           of RFC 3756 [SEND].




   Relevant RFCs  draft-ietf-ipv6-2461bis-11 [NDbis] describes correct
           host behavior for this scenario.  RFC 3756 [SEND] describes
           host behavior during address resolution.

           and NS from host.

   How to detect  On the host, the ping may fail.  With a packet capture
           tool, one can observe the NS sent by the host where the
           target address in the NS matches the ping destination.  The
           packet capture also demonstrates that no ping packet has been
           sent from the host.




   How to fix  The host should assume all non-link-local destinations to
           be off-link, and send non-link-local traffic to the default
           router.

2.2.  A DHCPv6 host sending excessive NS(DAD)s

   Name of problem  A DHCPv6 host sending excessive NS(DAD)s.




   Classification  Congestion control.




   Description  An IPv6 host was asked by the aggregation router to
           perform DHCPv6 (through setting the M bit in the RA).  During
           the course of Link-local DAD and DHCPv6 DAD, the host sent 4
           DADs for its link-local address and five DADs for its DHCPv6
           acquired address.  In an aggregation router deployment,
           especially during an aggregation router reload, when more
           than 100,000 hosts can register with the aggregation router,
           sending nine DADs can congest the upstreams.  In some
           aggregator deployments where upstream bandwidth is much less
           than downstream bandwidth, sending nine DADs for every host
           during host registration would waste upstream bandwidth and
           decrease the registration rate.  This host behavior is
           compliant with the ND protocol and DAD, however, for an
           aggregator deployment with limited upstream bandwidth this
           behavior is not desirable.  Also, link-type specific
           standards for aggregator networks should define the number of
           DADs to be sent by hosts serviced by the aggregation router.

   Significance  Performance of an aggregation router suffers when hosts
           register in a congested aggregator deployment where upstream
           bandwidth is limited.




   Implications  This behavior decreases the registration rate of all
           hosts on the aggregator.  VoIP could be deployed with such
           hosts and slower host registration can delay or prevent VoIP
           call recovery after an unexpected aggregation router reload.




   Relevant RFCs  The default value for DupAddrDetectTransmits variable
           is specified as one in section 5.1 of RFC 2462 [ADDRCONF].
           RFC 2462 [ADDRCONF] also mentions defining a different value
           of DupAddrDetectTransmits for a specific link-type.




   Trace file demonstrating it  ND message debugging should be enabled
           on the aggregation router.  This debug log shows the nine
           DAD's from a host during the time the host registers with the
           aggregation router.  Alternatively, a packet capture tool
           could have been used to capture DAD messages between the host
           and the aggregation router.

   How to detect  Enable ND message debugging on the aggregation router
           and capture DADs from the host or use a packet capture tool
           between the aggregation router and the host to capture DAD
           messages.




   How to fix  A new link-type document for aggregator deployment should
           define a new value for DupAddrDetectTransmits.
           Alternatively, the default of one specified in section 5.1 of
           RFC 2462 [ADDRCONF] should be used.

2.3.  Incorrect host behavior after automatic insertion of a directly

   Name of problem  Incorrect host behavior after automatic insertion of
           a directly connected route during address acquisition.




   Classification  Reliability.




   Description  The router sends an RA with M bit set, and no PIO.
           After address acquisition, a host incorrectly adds a directly
           connected route to the host's forwarding tables using an
           invented prefix (assuming a default prefix length) that is
           partially derived from the acquired address.  This host
           behavior does not follow on-link determination rules, and is
           independent of possible on-link information sent in the RA.
           This behavior causes the host to add an entry to the Prefix
           List of the host inappropriately.  The host MUST NOT add a
           directly connected route to the prefix from an assigned
           address, independent of the information about the prefix
           received from the sources described in section 2.1 of
           draft-ietf-ipv6-2461bis-11 [NDbis].




   Significance  Host may not be able to send IPv6 traffic.




   Implications  After a host inappropriately adds a prefix to the
           Prefix List, when the host attempts to send a data packet
           with a destination which matches the Prefix List entry, the
           host will incorrectly assume the destination is on-link and
           it will issue an NS to resolve the destination.  A router and
           the destination host may not respond to this NS and the host
           may not send the data packet.




   Relevant RFCs  This document describes correct host behavior for this
           scenario.

   How to detect  Inspect the host's routing/forwarding tables after
           host address acquistion completes.




   How to fix  The host MUST follow the rules defined in this document.

2.4.  Aggregation router sending Redirects when hosts communicate to
      each other from behind different modems

   Name of problem  Aggregation router sending Redirects when hosts
           communicate to each other from behind different modems.




   Classification  Reliability.




   Description  Due to scability and security concerns, hosts behind
           different modems in an aggregation network cannot communicate
           directly with each other.  If this aggregation router issues
           a Redirect to any pair of hosts behind different modems that
           are on the same link of this router, the aggregation router
           falsely indicates to the hosts that they can talk directly to
           each other.  In this aggregation network, a pair of hosts
           behind different modems on the same link can only communicate
           with each other by sending their traffic to the aggregation
           router.




   Significance  The aggregation router is providing incorrect
           information to the host that the host can communicate
           directly to another host when the pair of hosts can only
           communicate with each other via the aggregation router.




   Implications  There are two hosts behind different modems on the same
           link of an aggregation router.  If a ping is issued from one
           host to the other and the aggregation router sends a Redirect
           to one of the hosts, the host receiving the Redirect may

           attempt direct communication with the other host, and fail.




   Relevant RFCs  This document describes correct host behavior for this
           scenario.




   Trace file demonstrating it  A packet capture tool can demonstrate
           that Redirects are being issued by the router.
           Alternatively, debug commands on the aggregation router can
           demonstrate that the router is sending Redirects, as shown
           below.

ICMPv6: Sending REDIRECT for 2001:420:3800:809:4EF:E3B1:1569:27B5,
        target 2001:420:3800:809:4EF:E3B1:1569:27B5 on <router interface>
ICMPv6: Sending REDIRECT for 2001:420:3800:809:65E8:C4A9:8828:F5BC,
        target 2001:420:3800:809:65E8:C4A9:8828:F5BC on <router interface>

                                 Figure 5.




   How to detect  During the ping, one can use a network capture of
           Redirects being issued by the router, or debug output on the
           router.




   How to fix  The aggregation router MUST block sending any Redirects
           to hosts behind different modems.
