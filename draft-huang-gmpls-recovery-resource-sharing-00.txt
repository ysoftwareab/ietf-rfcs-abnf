Abstract


  Many protection and restoration (P&R) techniques are proposed to
  protect LSP in Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS)
  networks. Provisioning better P&R capability requires that much
  recovery resources be allocated on protection LSP, which may lead
  to resource waste in GMPLS networks.


  This draft presents a scheme of recovery resource sharing with
  traffic balancing for GMPLS LSP based P&R. Its focus is on the
  discussions of working and protection LSPs selection and the shared
  resource allocation and release.

1. Introduction


  As the real-time and multimedia-oriented services are rapidly
  increasing on Internet, a small link or node failure is unacceptable
  to customers. Service continuity is becoming much more important
  than before. P&R (see [TERM]) is the key technique to improve
  service continuity by establishing protection path for working path.
  Obviously, recovery resources reserved on protection path are idle
  at most time, which is unreasonable from the viewpoint of resource
  utilization.


  An efficient way to improve recovery resource utilization is to have
  protection LSPs, whose working LSPs are physically disjoint, share
  bandwidth resources. This mechanism was coined as shared mesh
  restoration and described in [GMPLS-ANAL]. Clearly, not all GMPLS
  recovery mechanisms can provide shared mesh restoration. For
  example, in the 1+1 protection mechanism, the traffic is transmitted
  simultaneously on both the working and protection LSPs. The selector
  at the egress will decide which path to use according to the quality
  of signal. Obviously, no recovery resource can be shared in 1+1
  protection, while other recovery mechanisms such as M:N recovery aim
  to provision shared mesh restoration.

  To share the recovery resources can save bandwidth in networks,
  thus, rejected session setup requests can be decreased in a certain
  degree. Moreover, maximum recovery resource sharing with traffic
  balancing can further decrease rejected session setup requests in
  GMPLS networks. We will discuss the scheme to optimize recovery
  resource sharing with traffic balancing and the signaling implement-
  ation of the scheme.


  Section 2 introduces the notions used in the draft. Section 3
  describes the scheme to optimize recovery resource sharing with
  traffic balancing. Section 4 provides the signaling implementation
  of the scheme. Section 5 discusses resource allocation and release.
  Section 6 evaluates the performance of the proposed scheme. Section
  7 presents the application of the scheme in LSP segment P&R. And,
  Section 8 concludes this draft.


2. Notions


  We model arbitary GMPLS network as G=(V, E), where V is the set of
  nodes and E is the set of all links in networks. A LSP is defined as
  LSP={s, r1, ..., rn, d}, where s and d denote source and destination
  nodes respectively, and rk denotes the k-th intermediate LSR along
  the LSP. In addition, to identify a LSP in GMPLS networks, either a
  global identifier (ID) or a triple <s, d, local_ID> must be used.
  To simplify the presentation, the global identifier (ID) is used in
  this draft. Furthermore, the following notations are defined:


  l(i, j): The link from nodes i to j.


  Cij:     The cost of l(i, j).


  Bij:     Total amount of bandwidth reserved for protection LSPs on
           l(i, j).


  Rij:     Total amount of residual bandwidth on l(i, j).


  PLij:    Set of protection LSPs that traverse l(i, j).
           PLij={PLij[1], PLij[2], ..., PLij[N]}, where PLij[k] is
           the ID of the k-th protection LSP and N is the total number
           of protection LSPs on l(i, j).


  WLij:    Set of LSPs which are protected by l(i, j).
            WLij={WLij[1], WLij[2], ..., WLij[N]}, where WLij[k] is
            the ID of the LSP protected by PLij[k].


  fij[k]:  The bandwidth demand of PLij[k](WLij[k]).


  t[k][m]: The bandwidth that PLij[k] shares with PLij[m]. So, the
           actual recovery bandwidth allocated to PLij[k] is
           fij[k] - sum {m=1}^N [tij[k][m]].


  Sij[k]:  Set of all links and intermediate nodes along WLij[k].

draft-gmpls-recovery-resource-sharing-00.txt                 July 2004



  Inf(Wlsp): Set of all links and intermediate nodes along Wlsp, where
             Wlsp denotes the selected working LSP.


  WT[i,j]: Weight of l(i, j) used in computing route.


  In this draft, we assume node i is the dominating node of l(i, j),
  that is, the information about PLij, WLij, fij[k], Sij[k] and
  tij[k][m] are held in node i locally. Thus, PLij, WLij, fij[k],
  Sij[k] and tij[k][m] can be refreshed on node i when any protection
  LSP traversing l(i, j) is set up.


3. Recovery Resource Sharing With Traffic Balancing


   In the proposed scheme, only information of Bij and Rij is required
   for computing a route, that is, only Bij and Rij are flooded in
   networks. The flooding of Bij and Rij can be easily implemented by
   route protocol extensions OSPF [GMPLS-OSPF] / IS-IS [OSPF-ISIS] in
   GMPLS. The current solutions for recovery resource sharing are the
   two approaches mentioned in [GMPLS-ANAL]: Full Information and
   Partial Information approaches. We coin the scheme in this draft as
   Proper Information approach.


   Let b be the bandwidth demand of a LSP setup request. When
   computing the route of working LSP, the Proper Information approach
   computes the weight of l(i, j) as follows,


                       _ _  Cij / Rij    (Rij >= b)
                      |
              WT[i,j]=|
                      |_ _  infinity     (otherwise)


   After the working LSP is selected, when protection LSP is being
   selected, WT[i,j] should be computed as follows,


                       ---- Cij                   (Bij >= b)
                      |
              WT[i,j]=|---- Cij+Cij*(1-Bij/b)     (Bij<b, Rij>=b-Bij)
                       |
                       ---- infinity              (otherwise)


   The weight computation of l(i, j) above has two advantages:
   a) It can provision more probability of recovery resource sharing
   in GMPLS networks. b) It can balance the traffic in GMPLS networks.
   When computing working LSP, it is obvious that the WT(i, j) will be
   less if l(i, j) has more residual bandwidth. When protection LSP is
   selected, WT(i, j) will be less if l(i, j) has reserved more
   bandwidth. Thus, links with more reserved bandwidth will be more
   possible to be selected as the segments of protection LSP.


   Suppose Plsp is selected as protection LSP. Let Bw(i,j) represent
   the recovery resources that should be allocated for Plsp on
   l(i, j). The computation of Bw(i, j) is conducted on node i as
   follows.


Internet Draft - Expires January 2005                         [page 4]


draft-gmpls-recovery-resource-sharing-00.txt                 July 2004



      w = Bij - sum{k} [fij[k]];
      where k must satify: (Inf(Wlsp) AND Sij[k]) is not an empty set;


                 ---- 0                     (b <= w)
                |
        Bw(i,j)=|---- b - w                 (Rij >= b-w, b>w)
                |
                 ---- infinity              (otherwise)


   Note that Bw(i,j) may be set to infinity as above, which means
   recovery resource reserving action may fail on l(i, j). The reason
   of this is the bandwidth estimation in computing protection LSP
   is inaccurate. Two conditions in computing WT[i,j] for protection
   LSP may cause the failure of Plsp setup:


   a)Even if Bij>=b is satisfied, only x bandwidth units can be shared
     due to the restriction that the protected LSPs must be physically
     disjoint, where x<b. However, Rij<(b-x), which means no enough
     residual resources can be allocated for recovery purpose. So,
     recovery resource allocation may fail on l(i, j).


   b)When Bij<b and Rij>=(b-Bij) are satisfied, b-Bij bandwidth units
     need to be allocated at least as recovery resources. But, only x
     bandwidth units can be shared due to the restriction that the
     protected LSPs must be physically disjoint, where x<Bij. Thus,
     more bandwidth than b-Bij should be allocated as recovery
     resources now. As a result, no enough residual resources can be
     allocated if Rij<(b-x).


   However, the probability of conditions a) and b) occurrence is
   very small in practical networks. Thus, it has little affect on the
   performance of rejected LSP setup requests in the scheme. In fact,
   the Proper Information approach performs very well in decreasing
   rejected LSP setup requests in Section 7.


4. Signaling Procedure


  In this draft, we describe the signaling procedure for Proper
  Information approach based on RSVP-TE developed in [RFC-3473].


  No additional signaling procedure is required in the Proper
  Information approach though all nodes along the selected protection
  LSP must be informed Inf(Wlsp). As assumed in Section II, node i
  is the dominating node for any l(i, j), and the information about
  PLij, WLij, fij[k], Sij[k] and tij[k][m] will be obtained on node i.

  We assume the information of Bij and Rij have been advertised to all
  nodes in networks by routing protocol extension. When receiving the
  LSP setup request, the source node uses Dijkstra's algorithm to
  select the working LSP with WT[i,j] computed as above. When the
  working LSP Wlsp is selected, the information of Inf(Wlsp) is held
  on the source node. A Path message is sent from the source to the
  destination node along Wlsp to setup the LSP. After receiving the
  Path message, the destination node sends a Resv message back to the
  source node. All intermediate nodes along Wlsp will allocate the
  resources for Wlsp when receiving the Resv message. When Resv
  message reaches the source, the establishment of Wlsp is finished.


  Then, protection LSP Plsp is selected by source node in terms of
  WT[i,j] computed in Section 3. Similar to the establishment of Wlsp,
  a Path message is sent from source to destination node along Plsp.
  Here, the information of Inf(Wlsp) and the ID of established
  working LSP can be transmitted to all intermediate nodes along Plsp
  with Path message. Any node receiving the Path message will utilize
  Inf(Wlsp) to compute Bw(i,j).


  If the computation result of Bw(i,j) is infinity, the node will ter-
  minate the propagation of Path message and send a PathErr message
  back to the source node to notify the failure of Plsp establishment.
  Otherwise, the Path message will be forwarded to the next hop till
  it reaches the destination node. Then, the destination sends a Resv
  message back to the source node along Plsp.  Upon receiving the
  Resv message, the intermediate nodes allocate recovery resources
  according to previous computed Bw(i,j). The establishment of Plsp is
  completed when source node receives the Resv message.


  As shown above, no additional signaling procedure is required for
  working and protection LSPs setup in the Proper Information
  approach. But additional information (e.g., information of
  Inf(Wlsp)) must be transmitted during the signaling procedure.


  The signaling procedure of LSP release will not be discussed in this
  section due to two facts: 1) The signaling procedure for LSP release
  in the Proper Information approach is the same as that in standard
  GMPLS. 2) No additional information will be transmitted when
  releasing working and protection LSPs in the Proper Information
  approach.


5. PROTECTION Object


  In this section, we describe the extensions to the PROTECTION object
  in Path message to broaden it to transmit the information of
  Inf(Wlsp).

6. Resource Allocation and Release







Internet Draft - Expires January 2005                         [page 7]


draft-gmpls-recovery-resource-sharing-00.txt                 July 2004



  In this section, we introduce how to assign and release resources
  correctly and effectively. Clearly, recovery resource release is
  an opposite procedure of recovery resource allocation. RSVP-TE is
  still used as signaling protocol in this section.


6.1 Resource Allocation


  The resource allocation consists of two procedures: resource alloc-
  ation for working LSP and resource allocation for protection LSP.
  The resource allocation procedures are as follows:


  Proc.1) A new working LSP Wlsp is being established. The bandwidth
           demand is b units. For any link l(i, j) along Wlsp, when
           node i receives Resv message:


          - Update Rij in terms of b.


  Proc.2) A new protection LSP Plsp is being established. LSP ID of
           Plsp is Y and bandwidth demand is b units. The ID of working
           LSP that Plsp protects is X. For any link l(i, j)
           along Plsp, when node i receives Resv message:


           - Update Rij, Bij according to Bw(i,j), which has been
             computed when node i received the associated Path message.
             Add Y to set PLij and X to set WLij.


           - The value of fij[k] is set to b.


           - A set T, which contains the protection LSP IDs with which
             the new protection LSP Plsp may share bandwidth, is
             obtained.


           - Some protection LSPs in T are selected to share bandwidth
             with Plsp. Then, the amount of shared bandwidth for each
             selected protection LSP is computed. Finally, both
             tij[k][m] and tij[m][k] are updated.


6.2 Resource Release


  The resource release also consists of two procedures: resource
  release for working LSP and resource release for protection LSP.
  The resource release procedures are as follows:


  Proc.1) A working LSP Wlsp is being released. The bandwidth demand
          is b units. For any link l(i, j) along Wlsp, when node i
           receives ResvTear message:


         - Update Rij according to b.







Internet Draft - Expires January 2005                         [page 8]


draft-gmpls-recovery-resource-sharing-00.txt                 July 2004



  Proc.2) A new protection LSP Plsp is being released. LSP ID of Plsp
           is Y and bandwidth demand is b units. The ID of working
           LSP that Plsp protects is X. For any link l(i, j) along
           Plsp, when node i receives ResvTear message:


           - Remove Y from set PLij and X from set WLij.


           - When Plsp was setup, it may share some recovery resources
             with others. Also, some resources allocated for Plsp may
             be shared by other protection LSPs during the holding time
             of Plsp. These shared resources should not be released
             when Plsp is released. Let C denote the bandwidth that
             will be actually released. C can be computed according to
             fij[k] and tij[k][m].


           - Update Rij, Bij in terms of C.


6.3 Illustration of Resource Allocation and Release


  The resource allocation and release procedures can be illustrated
  using the following network topology:


              ======X(3)=======
             a-----------------b
             |======Y(5)=======|
             |* *           * *|      working LSP
             |* *           * *|      ==========
             |* ****Y'(5)**** *|
             |******X'(3)******|      Protection LSP
             c-----------------d      **********
             |******Z'(7)******|
             |*               *|
             |*               *|
             |*               *|
             e-----------------f
              ======Z(7)=======


  In the initial state, two working LSPs X and Y are established
  between nodes a and b. The bandwidth demands of X and Y are 3 and 5
  units respectively. The protection LSPs for X and Y are X'={a,c,d,b}
  and Y'={a,c,d,b}. Note that X' and Y' can not share recovery
  resources since X and Y are not physical disjoint. Thus, we can
  obtain Bcd=8, PLcd={X', Y'}, WLcd={X, Y}, fcd[1]=3, fcd[2]=5,
  tcd[1][2]=0 and tcd[2][1]=0. Now, a new LSP Z is setup between nodes
  e and f with 7 units of bandwidth demand. The protection LSP for Z
  is Z'={e,c,d,f}. Clearly, no resources require to be allocated on
  l(c, d) because Z' can share resources with X' and Y' due to the
  fact that LSP Z is disjoint with LSPs X and Y.

draft-gmpls-recovery-resource-sharing-00.txt                 July 2004



  In terms of resource allocation procedures above, we can get Bcd=8,
  PLcd={X', Y', Z'}, WLcd={X, Y, Z}, fcd[1]=3, fcd[2]=5, fcd[3]=7,
  tcd[1][3]=3, tcd[2][3]=4, tcd[3][1]=3 and tcd[3][2]=4 after Z' is
  established. Next, we give the examples of shared resource release
  on l(c,d). Three situations will be considered, which are releasing
  Z' first, releasing X' first and releasing Y' first.


  i) Releasing Z' first: In this situation, LSP Z expires before X and
     Y. According to the resource release procedures, the bandwidth
     released for Z' on l(c,d) is computed as
     fcd[3]-tcd[3][1]-tcd[3][2]=0. So, no resource should be released
     when releasing Z'. Thus, the refreshed information is Bcd=8,
     PLcd={X', Y'}, WLcd={X, Y}, fcd[1]=3, fcd[2]=5, tcd[1][2]=0 and
     tcd[2][1]=0, which is the same as that in the initial state.


  ii) Releasing X' first: On l(c,d), the recovery resources for X' are
      all shared by Z'. Thus, the bandwidth released for X' is
      fcd[1]-tcd[1][3]=0. After X' is released, the refreshed
      information is Bcd=8, PLcd={Y', Z'}, WLcd={Y,Z}, fcd[1]=5,
      fcd[2]=7, tcd[1][2]=4 and tcd[2][1]=4.


  iii) Releasing Y' first: When releasing Y', only part of recovery
        resources for it should be released because some recovery
        resource is being shared by Z'. Here, the bandwidth released
        is fcd[2]-tcd[2][3]=1. In terms of resource release
        procedures, we obtain the refreshed information on l(c,d),
        which is Bcd=7, PLcd={X', Z'}, WLcd={X, Z}, fcd[1]=3,
        fcd[2]=7, tcd[1][2]=3 and tcd[2][1]=3.


7. Performance Evaluation


  We evaluate the performance of Proper Information approach in diffe-
  rent tested networks by simulations. Two metrics are examined,
  1) recovery overhead, which is the rate of the total bandwidth
  allocated for protection LSPs to the total bandwidth reserved for
  working LSPs in networks. 2) rejected session setup requests.


  The proposed approach is compared to the Full Information Flooding
  approach (see [GLI]), which has optimal performance in recovery
  overhead. The results show that the proposed scheme gives a
  performance difference of less than 3% in recovery overhead
  compared to [GLI]. When it comes to rejected requests, the number
  of rejected requests in [GLI] is almost the double of the proposed
  scheme. Clearly, Proper Information approach decreases rejected
  requests in GMPLS networks significantly due to its capability of
  traffic balancing.


8. LSP Segments P&R


  The Proper Information approach can be applied to LSP segments P&R
  without any modification. But the performance needs further study.

9. Conclusions


  This draft discussed the issue of recovery resource sharing with
  traffic balancing in GMPLS networks. We propose the Proper Informat-
  ion approach to provision the capability of recovery resource
  sharing and traffic balancing. The Proper Information approach
  needs less bandwidth information than other approaches. Moreover,
  no additional signaling procedure is required. We highlight the
  signaling implementation of it, including resource allocation and
  release procedures. We conclude that the proposed scheme indeed
  improves resource utilization and decreases rejected requests in
  GMPLS networks.


10. IANA Considerations


  IANA assigns values to RSVP protocol parameters. Within the current
  document a PROTECTION object (new C-Type) are defined.


  - PROTECTION object: Class-Num = 37, C-Type = 3 (suggested)
