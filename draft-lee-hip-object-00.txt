1. Introduction 

   The role of Host Identity Protocol (HIP) is the separation between 
   the location and identity information by introducing a new 
   cryptographic name space which is called Host Identity (HI). It 
   provides enhanced network security as well as easy management of 
   mobility and multi-homing [RFC4423].  

   The one of new capabilities for future network will be the ubiquitous 
   networking such as the Internet of things. This networking capability 
   requires "Any Services, Any Time, Any Where and Any Devices" 
   operation. In order to connect objects (e.g., devices and/or 
   machines) to large databases and networks, a simple, unobtrusive and 
   cost-effective system of item identification is crucial. The concept 
   of host should be extended to support all of objects. However, there 
   is no consideration for new type of objects (e.g., contents, RFID 
   tags, sensors, etc) as end points.  

   This document explains object to object communications. For 
   identification of network entities, we consider new type of 
   identifiers (e.g., RFID code, content, ID etc) for object and 
   describe specific requirements for object identification in naming 
   and addressing point of view. 

   In order to use HIP for object to object communication, this document 
   provides the extended architecture of HIP according to mapping 
   relationship between host and object(s). In addition, packet formats 
   and considerations for HIP extensions are specified. 

 

2. Object to Object Communications 

   For ubiquitous networking, future network will require the extensions 
   of networking functionalities to all objects. New networking concept 
   will be considered for networking capabilities to support various 
   classes of applications/services which require "Any Services, Any 
   Time, Any Where and Any Devices" operation using Internet. This 
   networking capability should support human-to-human, human-to-object 
   (e.g., device and/or machine) and object-to-object communications. 

   There are many different kinds of devices connecting to the network 
   supported for ubiquitous networking in Internet. RFID tag, sensors, 
   smart cards, medical devices, navigation devices, vehicles as well as 
   the existing personal devices such as PC, Personal Digital Assistant

   (PDA), etc., are examples of these. This document considers that the 
   end points which are not always humans but may be objects such as 
   devices /machines, and then expanding to small objects and parts of 
   objects.  

   Thus, object to object communications will be provided using the new 
   concept of end points considering object. This document focuses on 
   how to support object to object communications using extensions of 
   existing HIP. 

    

3. Object Identification 

3.1. Classification of network entities to be identified 

   There are several network entities to be identified in the network. 
   These network entities have a layered architecture and are used for 
   naming, addressing and routing. 

   o Services (i.e., information related to applications/services) 

   o End points (i.e., global unique identifier) 

   o Location (i.e., IP address) 

   o Path (i.e., routing) 

   In particular, for object to object communications, information for 
   several kinds of object on top of end points should be identified in 
   the network. 

3.2. Identification codes 

   Identification of all objects for providing end-to-end connectivity 
   in ubiquitous networking environment is crucial. Identifier is 
   capable of identifying all objects and facilitates objects-to-objects 
   communications. In particular, the globally unique identifier enables 
   a lot of applications including item tracking, access control, and 
   protection, etc [1]. 

   There are other kinds of identifiers such as E.164 number code, 
   Extended Unique Identifier (EUI)-64, Media Access Control (MAC) 
   address, Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)/ Uniform Resource Locator 
   (URL), etc.  

   These identification codes can be classified as follows.

   o Service IDs: include RFID, Content ID, telephone number, URL/URI, 
      etc 

   o Communication IDs: include session/protocol ID, IP address, MAC 
      address, etc 

3.3. Examples of service IDs for objects 

3.3.1. RFID 

   The identification codes, so-called Electronic Product Code (EPC), 
   for RFID/sensors are very important in ubiquitous networking 
   environment. An EPC is simply a number assigned to an RFID tag 
   representative of an actual electronic product code. Their value is 
   that they have been carefully characterized and categorized to embed 
   certain meanings within their structure. Each number is encoded with 
   a header, identifying the particular EPC version used for coding the 
   entire EPC number. An EPC manager number is defined, allowing 
   individual companies or organizations to be uniquely identified; an 
   object class number is present, identifying objects used within this 
   organization, such as product types. Finally, a serial number is 
   characterized, allowing the unique identification of each individual 
   object tagged by the organization [2]. 

3.3.2. Content ID 

   The Content ID is a unique identifier that can specify and 
   distinguish any kind of digital content that is distributed. As a 
   unique code attached to a content object, the Content ID serves well 
   enough as an identifier, but actually it is much more than just that. 
   It is also the key to a complete set of attribute information about a 
   content object stored as metadata including the nature of the 
   contents, rights-related information, information about distribution, 
   and more. The Content ID provides the key enabling metadata to be 
   uniquely associated with a particular digital object [3].                 

3.4. Requirements for naming and addressing using object identification 

   The layered architecture of naming and addressing requires specific 
   processing capabilities at each layer. Each user/object in service 
   layer identifies by identity like name with a set of attributes of an 
   entity. An attribute can be thought of as metadata that belongs to a 
   specific entity in a specific context, some of which could to be 
   highly private or sensitive. The identity should be associated with 
   service IDs (RFID, content ID, telephone number, URI/URL, etc) 
   through identification and authorization.

        HIP Extension for Object to Object Communications  July 2008 
    

   As shown in Figure 1, each service ID should be associated with 
   communication IDs (session/protocol ID, IP address, MAC address, etc) 
   through mapping/binding.  

                   +-----------------+ 
                   |    Service IDs  |                   
                   +-----------------+ 
                          | 
                          |mapping/binding 
                          | 
                   +-----------------+ 
                   |Communication IDs|  
                   +-----------------+ 
                    
             Figure 1 Mapping/binding for naming and addressing 

   An ID resolution server such as Domain Name System (DNS), can provide 
   a function to translate the identifier of object into service 
   /communication ID to access networking services provided by 
   database/application servers.  

   How to map/bind IP address (i.e., communications IDs) with other 
   identifiers (i.e., service IDs) for providing end-to-end IP 
   connectivity is challenging issue. Identity protocol for object, i.e., 
   HIP extensions, can perform this capability.  

   Additionally, the following features should be provided using naming 
   and addressing capability through object identification.  

   o Protection of object (including right management) 

   o Connecting to anything using object identification 

   o Service and location discovery 

    

4. HIP Architecture for Object to Object Communications 

4.1. The mapping relationships between host and object(s) 

4.1.1. Host = Object (one to one mapping) 

   In case of a host is equal to an object, there is one to one mapping 
   relationship between host and object. Most of information devices 
   such as PC, etc are included in this case.  

 
 
Lee                   Expires January 7, 2009                [Page 7] 
     
         HIP Extension for Object to Object Communications  July 2008 
    

   For example, if you use a telephone device, the device as host can be 
   allocated a telephone number as service ID and be treated the same 
   object. 

4.1.2. Host =! Object (one to many mapping) 

   In case of a host is not equal to an object, there is one to many 
   mapping relationship between host and object(s). Content server, RFID 
   tags/Reader, etc are included in this case. 

   There are two kinds of one to many mapping as follows (see Figure 2): 

   o As shown in Figure 2 (a), host including objects such as content 
      server, a host includes many objects and these objects should be 
      identified using content ID, etc. 

   o As shown in Figure 2 (b), host with remote objects such as RFID 
      tags, a host has many remote objects and these objects should be 
      identified using RFID code, etc. In this case, each object might 
      be non IP. 

    

4.2. The stack architecture 

   The original stack architecture of HIP can be extended according to 
   the mapping relationships between host and object(s). 

   o As shown in Figure 3 (a), objects in a host (case #1), the end 
      point is the same with current HIP architecture. However, each 
      object in service layer should be identified by a host using 
      mapping protocol for object. 

   o As shown in Figure 3 (b), remote objects (case #2), the end point 
      will be each object. This means that host location is different 
      from end point(s). Thus, current HIP should be extended to support 
      several end points with a host. From object information in service 
      layer, each object identity should be defined. 

   Detailed protocol extension will be specified in Section 5.

   The proposed address and identifier mapping structure has the 
   following advantages. 

   o Perform two functions together - Routing using network prefix 
      information and identification code using service IDs 

   o Provide the connectivity to end device without additional 
      equipment such as Network Address Translator  

   o Scalability - enough name space for supporting objects-to-objects 
      communications 

   o Security - security solution using HIP hash function, etc 

    

5. HIP Extensions 

5.1. Case #1: Objects in a host 

   In case of Figure 3 (a), several object identifiers as well as host 
   identity should be delivered to each host for mapping information 
   between host identity and object identities.  

   In order to deliver object information, this document newly defines a 
   new TLV, i.e., Object_ID (see Section 5.3.). 

    

5.2. Case #2: Remote objects 

   As case of Figure 3 (b), Object Identity (OI) information instead of 
   host identity should be delivered to each host for mapping 
   information between IP address and object identities 

   Thus, this document newly specifies Object Identity Tag (OIT) in HIP 
   message. Each OIT typically identifies a service and can also 
   identify end point. 

    

5.3. Packet format 

   To support the previous extended architecture for object, the current 
   HIP packet should be extended as follows.

   follow the concept of the existing HIP specified in [RFC5201]. 

   Other packet formats are subject to change according to HIP. 

    

6. Considerations for HIP Extensions 

6.1. Support of DNS, and HIP rendezvous server 

   In order to support from existing infrastructure, including DNS, and 
   HIP rendezvous server, it is required to define DNS resource records. 
   The newly defined DNS resource records should include information on 
   object identifiers and object identity tags (OITs) 

    

6.2. Protocol overhead 

   Real time communications and some limitation of power and packet size, 
   lightweight identity handshake for datagram transactions is critical. 

    

6.3. Considerations for specific user cases 

   HIP for object can use original advantages of HIP for specific user 
   cases.

   o Identity-based roaming and mobility 

   o Hierarchical routing 

   o Addressing and location management 

   o Multi-homing 

    

6.4. Services using extended HIP 

   The proposed extended HIP can provide an integrated solution for 
   personal location and management through identification /naming 
   /addressing including ID registration, location tracking, dynamic 
   mobility control, and security using the following networking 
   services: 

   o Identity management (IdM) services for the management of the 
      identity life cycle of objects including managing unique IDs, 
      attributes, credentials, entitlements to consistently enforce 
      business and security policies. 

   o Location management services for real-time location tracking, 
      monitoring, and information processing of moving objects similar 
      with Supply Chain Management. 

   o Networked ID (N-ID) services for providing communication service 
      which is triggered by an identification process started via 
      reading an identifier from identifier storage such as RFID tag, 
      barcode label, smartcard, etc.
