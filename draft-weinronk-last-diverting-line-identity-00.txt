Abstract

   This document proposes an extension to the Session Initiation
   Protocol (SIP).

   In cases where applications/services (for example verification /
   billing) are provided by a network that is not the originating
   network the Network Asserted Identity is needed to provide these
   services.

   This extension provides the ability for a 'diversion service' to
   provide a Network Asserted Identity of the last diverting user to
   these applications/services.

   This extension defines a new general header, Last Diverting Line
   Identity which conveys the Network Asserted Identity of the
   diverting party to these applications/services.

1. Introduction

   In cases where applications/services (for example verification /
   billing) are provided by a network that is not the originating
   network the Network Asserted Identity is needed to provide these
   services.

   This extension provides the ability for a 'diversion service' to
   provide a Network Asserted Identity of the last diverting user to
   these applications/services.

   This extension defines a new general header, Last Diverting Line
   Identity which conveys the Network Asserted Identity of the
   diverting party to these applications/services.

   In the legacy telephony network in the UK this information is
   provided by the Last Diverting Line Identity parameter. Note: This
   ISUP parameter is defined in the UK under the 'Nationally defined
   for National User' parameter code range of values.

2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

   In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation
   only when in ALL CAPS. Lower case uses of these words are not to be
   interpreted as carrying RFC-2119 significance.

3. Definitions

   Diversion:

   The 'diversion service' could be defined as in [RFC7044] or as in
   [TS.24604].

5. Overview

   In cases where applications/services (for example verification /
   billing) are provided by a network that is not the originating
   network the Network Asserted Identity is needed to provide these
   services.

   This extension provides the ability for a 'diversion service' to
   provide a Network Asserted Identity of the last diverting user to
   these applications/services.

   This extension defines a new general header, Last Diverting Line
   Identity which conveys the Network Asserted Identity of the
   diverting party to these applications/services.

   It could be added by SIP UAs, SIP Redirect Servers or SIP Proxy
   Servers.

   In the legacy telephony network in the UK this information is
   provided by the Last Diverting Line Identity parameter. Note: This
   ISUP parameter is defined in the UK under the 'Nationally defined
   for National User' parameter code range of values.

   Example headers are:

   Last-Diverting-Line-Identity: <sip:+441632123456@example.com;user=phone>

   Last-Diverting-Line-Identity: <tel:+441632123456>

6. Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (BNF) as described in RFC-2234 [RFC2234].

   Definition of new Last Diverting Line Identity header field:

   The Last Diverting Line Identity header field is used among trusted
   SIP entities (typically intermediaries) to carry the verified
   identity of the diverting user.

   Last-Diverting-Line-Identity = "Last-Diverting-Line-Identity" HCOLON
   LDLI-value

   LDLI-value = name-addr

   A Last-Diverting-Line-Identity header field value MUST consist of
   exactly one name-addr. It MUST be a sip, sips or tel URI.

6.1 The "ldli" Privacy Type

   This specification adds a new priv-value to the Privacy header
   [RFC3323]. The presence of this privacy type in a Privacy header
   field indicates that the user would like the Last Diverting Line
   Identity to be kept private with respect to untrusted SIP entities.

   priv-value = "ldli"

   If the "ldli" priv-value is not present the LDLI-value presentation
   is allowed.

   If the "ldli" priv-value is present then the LDLI-value presentation
   is restricted.

   This document adds the following entry to Table 2 of [RFC3261]:



    Header field                 where   proxy   ACK  BYE  CAN  INV  OPT  REG
     -----------                  -----   -----   ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---
 Last-Diverting-Line-Identity             amdr     -    -    -    o    -    -

    Header field                 where   proxy   SUB  NOT  REF  INF  UPD  PRA
     -----------                  -----   -----   ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---

Internet-Draft      Last Diverting Line Identity        September 2015


   The Last-Diverting-Line-identity header carries the following
   information, with the mandatory parameters required when the header
   is included in a request:

   LDLI-value a mandatory parameter for capturing the Last Diverting
   Line Identity.

7. Why not use existing headers

   Use of the last History-Info header entry [RFC7044] was considered
   however this is mapped to/from the ISUP Redirecting Number and there
   are cases where the ISUP Redirecting Number is not the Network
   Asserted Identity of the last diverting user - for example the ETSI
   ISDN Partial Re-routing service as implemented in the UK.

   Note: In the UK the mapping would be to/from the new SIP header and
   the UK ISUP Last Diverting Line Identity parameter which provides
   the same functionality in UK ISUP leaving the ISUP Redirecting
   Number mapping to/from History-Info header as in the existing IETF /
   3GPP / ITU / NICC specifications.

8. Security Considerations

   This document defines a header field for SIP. The use of the
   Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol [RFC5246] as a mechanism to
   ensure the overall confidentiality of the Last-Diverting-Line-
   Identity header fields is strongly RECOMMENDED.  If TLS is NOT used,
   the intermediary MUST ensure that the messages are only sent within
   an environment that is secured by other means or that the messages
   don't leave the intermediary's domain.  This results in Last-
   Diverting-Line-Identity's having at least the same level of security
   as other headers in SIP that are inserted by intermediaries.  With
   TLS, Last-Diverting-Line-Identity header fields are no less, nor no
   more, secure than other SIP header fields, which generally have even
   more impact on the subsequent processing of SIP sessions than the
   Last-Diverting-Line-Identity header field.

   Note that while using the SIPS scheme (as per [RFC5630]) protects
   Last-Diverting-Line-Identity from tampering by arbitrary parties
   outside the SIP message path, all the intermediaries on the path are
   trusted implicitly.  A malicious intermediary could arbitrarily
   delete, rewrite, or modify Last-Diverting-Line-Identity.  This
   specification does not attempt to prevent or detect attacks by
   malicious intermediaries.

   In terms of ensuring the privacy of LDLI-value, the same security
   considerations as those described in [RFC3323] apply.  The Privacy

   Service that's defined in [RFC3323] MUST also support the new
   Privacy header field priv-value of "ldli".

9. IANA Considerations

9.1. Registration of SIP Last-Diverting-Line-Identity Header

   This document defines a new SIP header field name:

   Last-Diverting-Line-Identity

   The following changes should be made to the header sub-registry
   under:

   http:///www.iana.org/assignments/sip-parameters

   The following row has been added to the header field section:

   Header Name                 Compact Form               Reference
   -----------                 ------------               ---------

   Last-Diverting-Line-Identity    none                    [????]

9.2. Registration of "ldli" for SIP Privacy Headers

   This document defines a new priv-value for the SIP Privacy header:

   ldli

   The following changes should be made to

   http://www.iana.org/assignments/sip-priv-values

   The following has been added to the registration for the SIP Privacy
   header:

   Name      Description                   Registrant   Reference
   ----      -----------                   ----------   ---------

   ldli     Privacy requested for          [????]       [????]

            Last-Diverting-Line-Identity

            header
