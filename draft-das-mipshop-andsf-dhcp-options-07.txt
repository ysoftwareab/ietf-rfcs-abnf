ANDSF DHCP Options                                       October 2010 
 
Abstract 
    
   This document defines new Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol  
   (DHCPv4 and DHCPv6) options to enable a mobile node to discover
   Access Network Discovery and Selection Function (ANDSF) entities 
   in an IP network. ANDSF is being developed in 3GPP and provides 
   inter-system mobility policies and access network specific 
   information to the mobile nodes(MNs).

1. Introduction 

   Access Network Discovery and Selection Function (ANDSF) is being
   defined in 3GPP [3GPPTS23.402] to provide necessary network 
   discovery and selection assistance data to the mobile nodes for 
   multi-access network scenarios where 3GPP access-network level 
   solutions are not sufficient for the mobile nodes to perform 
   network discovery and selection of non-3GPP networks. 

   The information provided by ANDSF contains inter-system mobility 
   policies and access network specific data to assist the mobile 
   node with performing the inter-system handover. This set of 
   information can either be provisioned in the mobile node by the 
   home operator, or provided to the mobile node (MN) dynamically by 
   the ANDSF over the S14 reference point as defined in [3GPPTS23.402]. 

   In 3GPP, the ANDSF is located either in the subscriber's home 
   operator or visited network and needs to be known to the MN or 
   discovered by the MN. According to [3GPPTS23.402] the ANDSF is 
   discovered through interaction with the Domain Name Service function 
   or the DHCP Server function. 

   This document defines new DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 options called the ANDSF 
   IP Address Options, which allow the MN to locate an ANDSF Server.

 IP Address
    
             IPv6 address(es) of ANDSF Server(s) 
   
   
   ANDSF servers MUST be listed in order of preference and the client
   SHOULD process them in decreasing order of preference.
 
                 
4. Option Usage 
    
4.1 Usage of ANDSF Options for DHCPv4 
     
   The requesting and sending of the proposed DHCPv4 options follow 
   the rules for DHCP options in [RFC2131]. 
     
  4.1.1 Mobile Node behavior 
    
   The mobile node MAY request the IP address of an ANDSF server 
   either during initial association with a network or when the 
   policy and access network information is required from ANDSF. It 
   MAY also request the IP address of an ANDSF server when the network 
   information is outdated or mobile does not have any ANDSF 
   information. 
    
   In order to request an address of a ANDSF Server, the mobile node 
   (DHCP client) MUST include an ANDSF IPv4 Address Option in the 
   Parameter Request List(PRL)in the respective DHCP messages as 
   defined in [RFC2131] and [RFC2132]. The DHCP Client MAY initiate a 
   new DHCP exchange or piggyback on other DHCP message exchanges. DHCP 
   client handling PRL options is specified in RFC2131, Section 4.4.


  4.2 Usage of ANDSF Options for DHCPv6  
    
   The requesting and sending of the proposed DHCPv6 options follow 
   the rules for DHCP options in [RFC3315]. 


    
  4.2.1 Mobile node behavior 
    
   The mobile node MAY request the IP address of an ANDSF server
   according to the scenarios described in Section 4.1.1.

ANDSF DHCP Options                                       October 2010

   



   In order to discover the address of an ANDSF Server, the mobile 
   node(DHCP client) MUST include an ANDSF IPv6 Address Option in the 
   Option Request Option (ORO) in the respective DHCP messages as 
   defined in [RFC3315]. The DHCP client MAY initiate a new DHCP 
   exchange or piggyback on other DHCP message exchanges. DHCP 
   client handling ORO options is specified in RFC3315, Sections 17.1 
   and 18.1. 

  
5. Security Considerations 
    
   If an adversary manages to modify the response from a DHCP server 
   or insert its own response, an MN could be led to contact a rogue
   ANDSF Server. A modified response could also be used to mount an
   amplification attack.
   
   DHCP authentication option described in [RFC3118] and [RFC3315] MAY 
   be used to mitigate the above attacks. In deployments where DHCP 
   authentication is not available, 3GPP specific lower layer security 
   services can be used to protect DHCP messages[3GPPTS33.402]. 3GPP 
   ANDSF framework also provides additional mechanisms that can also be 
   used to mitigate above attacks and to protect message exchanges 
   between ANDSF client and server at the higher layer [3GPPTS33.402]. 
	
   
6. IANA Considerations 

   This document defines two new DHCP options as described in Sections 
   2 and 3. 

   ANDSF IPv4 Address Option for DHCPv4(OPTION-IPv4_Address-ANDSF) TBA

   ANDSF IPv6 Address Option for DHCPv6 (OPTION-IPv6_Address-ANDSF) TBA
