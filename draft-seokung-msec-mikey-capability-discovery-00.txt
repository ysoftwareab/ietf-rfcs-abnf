1. Introduction 

   The Multimedia Internet Keying (MIKEY)[2] creates messages to 
   exchange keys and related security parameters and specifies 
   negotiation procedure to exchange messages. The Negotiation procedure 
   defined in RFC 3830 is that the initiator indicates the security 
   policy to be used. If the responder does not support it, the 
   responder can together with an error message, send back its own 
   capabilities to let the Initiator choose a common set of parameters. 
   But, this procedure is not appropriate for real-time Voice over IP 
   (VoIP) communications in that the number of roundtrip for seeking a 
   common algorithm increases if initiator and responder have many 
   encryption algorithms. 

    

   This document describes a negotiation procedure to reduce the number 
   of roundtrip defined in RFC 3830 for seeking a common set of 
   parameters between user agents. 

    

   The parameters defined in this document are exactly same as defined 
   in RFC 3830 [1]. 

    

2. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [1]. 

    

3. MIKEY Capability Negotiation Solution 

   The Initiator sends its own capabilities to let the Responder choose 
   a common set of parameters. This is done by including one or more 
   security policy payloads. If the Responder does support the set of 
   parameters suggested by the Initiator, the Responder message SHOULD 
   include the supported parameters using security payload. 

   If the Responder does not support it, the Responder can together with 
   an error message, send back its own capabilities (negotiation). This 
   is done to reduce the number of roundtrip. (one roundtrip is enough)

   If the Responder is not willing/capable of providing security or the 
   parties simply cannot agree, it is up to the parties' polices how to 
   behave, for example, accepting or rejecting an insecure   
   communication. 

    

   The Responder message is formed as: 

    

3.1. Pre-shared key 

    

    Initiator                                Responder          
                                                                
    I_Message =                                                  
    HDR, T, RAND, [ IDi ], [ IDr ], 
    {SP}, KEMAC                      ---> 
                                    [<---]   R_MESSAGE = 
                                             HDR, T, [ IDr ], {SP}, V 
    

3.2. Public-key encryption 

    

    Initiator                                  Responder 
                                                                
    I_Message =                                                  
    HDR, T, RAND, [ IDi|CERTi ],  
    [ IDr ], {SP}, KEMAC, [ CHASH ], 
    PKE, SIGNi                       ---> 
                                   [<---]   R_MESSAGE = 
                                            HDR, T, [ IDr ], {SP}, V

3.3. Diffie-Hellman key exchange

    I_Message =                                          
    HDR, T, RAND, [ IDi|CERTi ], 
    [ IDr ], {SP}, DHi, SIGNi       ---> 
                                  [<---]   R_MESSAGE = 
                                           HDR, T, [ IDr|CERTr ], IDi,
