INTERNET DRAFT         Using ED25519 in SSHFP RRs         March 27, 2014


1.  Introduction

   The Ed25519 [Ed25519] signature algorithm has been implemented in
   OpenSSH.  RFC 4255 [RFC4255] defines a DNS resource record, "SSHFP",
   which can be used to publish a fingerprint of the SSH server public
   key in the DNS.  This document updates the IANA "SSHFP RR Types for
   public key algorithms" registry by adding an algorithm number for
   Ed25519 [Ed25519].

2.. ED25519 Public Key with SHA-256 Fingerprint

   The SSHFP Resource Record for the ED25519 public key with SHA-256
   fingerprint would, for example, be:

      ssh.example.com IN SSHFP [TBD] 2 ( a87f1b687ac0e57d2a081a2f2826723
                                         34d90ed316d2b818ca9580ea384d924
                                         01 )

   RFC Editor Note: Please replace TBD with the value assigned by IANA.

3.  Security Considerations

   The overall security of using SSHFP for SSH host key verification is
   dependent on the security policies of the SSH host administrator and
   DNS zone administrator (in transferring the fingerprint), detailed
   aspects of how verification is done in the SSH implementation, and in
   the client's diligence in accessing the DNS in a secure manner. 
   Please refer to RFC 4255 [RFC4255] for a discussion of the security
   considerations.


4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add the following entry to the "SSHFP RR Types
   for public key algorithms" registry:

      +--------+-------------+------------+
      | Value  | Description |  Reference |
      +--------+-------------+------------+
      |  [TBD] |    ED25519  | [RFCXXXX]  |
      +--------+-------------+------------+

   RFC Editor Note: Please replace TBD with the value assigned by IANA
   and RFCXXXX to refer to this document.
