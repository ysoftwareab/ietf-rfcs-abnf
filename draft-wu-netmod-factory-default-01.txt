                        Factory default Setting
                   draft-wu-netmod-factory-default-01

Abstract

   This document defines a method to reset a YANG datastore to its
   factory-default content.  The reset operation may be used e.g. during
   initial zero-touch configuration or when the existing configuration
   has major errors, so re-starting the configuration process from
   scratch is the best option.

   A new reset-datastore RPC is defined.  Several methods of documenting
   the factory-default content are specified.

   Optionally a new "factory-default-running" read-only datastore is
   defined, that contains the data that will be copied over to the
   running datastore at reset.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines a method to reset a YANG datastore to its
   factory-default content.  The reset operation may be used e.g. during
   initial zero-touch configuration or when the existing configuration
   has major errors, so re-starting the configuration process from
   scratch is the best option.  When resetting a datastore all previous
   configuration settings will be lost and replaced by the factory-
   default content.

   A new reset-datastore RPC is defined.  Several methods of documenting
   the factory-default content are specified.

Internet-Draft           Factory Default Setting            October 2018


   Optionally a new "factory-default-running" read-only datastore is
   defined, that contains the data that will be copied over to the
   running datastore at reset.  This datastore can also be used in <get-
   data> operation.

   NETCONF defines the <delete> operation that allows resetting the
   <startup> datastore and the <discard-changes> operation that copies
   the content of the <running> datastore into the <candidate>
   datastore.  However it is not possible to reset the running
   datastore, to reset the candidate datastore without changing the
   running datastore or to reset any dynamic datastore.

   A RESTCONF server MAY implement the above NETCONF operations, but
   that would still not allow it to reset the running configuration.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The following terms are defined in [RFC8342] and are not redefined
   here:

   o  startup configuration datastore

   o  candiate configuration datastore

   o  running configuration datastore

   o  intended configuration datastore

   o  operational state datastore

   The following terms are defined in this document as follows:

   o  factory-default datastore: A read-only datastore holding a
      preconfigured minimal initial configuration that can be used to
      initialize the configuration of a server.  The content of the
      datastore is usually static, but MAY depend on external factors
      like available HW.

2.  Reset-Datastore RPC

   A new "reset-datastore" RPC is introduced.  It will have a target
   datastore as a parameter.  Upon receiveing the RPC the YANG server
   resets the content of the target datastore to its factory-default
   content.  Only writable datastores can be specified as a target.
   Read-only datastores receive their content from other datastores
   (e.g. <intended> gets its content from <running>).

   Factory-default content SHALL be specified by one of the following
   means in order of precedence

   1.  For the <running>, <candidate> and <startup> datastores as the
       content of the <factory-default> datastore, if it exists

   2.  YANG Instance Data [I-D.lengyel-netmod-yang-instance-data]

   3.  In some implementation specific manner

   4.  For dynamic datastores unless otherwise specified the factory-
       default content is empty.

3.  Factory-Default Datastore

   This document introduces a new datastore resource named 'Factory-
   Default' that represents a preconfigured minimal initial
   configuration that can be used to initialize the configuration of a
   server.

   o  Name: "factory-default"

   o  YANG modules: all

   o  YANG nodes: all "config true" data nodes

   o  Management operations: The content of the datastore is set by the
      YANG server in an implementation dependent manner.  The content
      can not be changed by management operations via NETCONF, RESTCONF,
      the CLI etc. unless specialized, dedicated operations are
      provided.  The contents of the datastore can be read using
      NETCONF, RESTCONF <get-data> operation.  The operation <reset-
      datastore> can be used to copy the content of the datastore to
      another datastore.  The content of the datastore is not propagated
      auomatically to any other datastores.

   o  Origin: This document does not define a new origin identity as it
      does not interact with <operational> datastore.

   o  Protocols: RESTCONF, NETCONF and other management protocol.

   o  Defining YANG module: "ietf-factory-default"

   The datastore content is usually defined by the device vendor.  It is
   usually static, but MAY change e.g. depending on external factors
   like HW available or during device upgrade.

   On devices that support non-volatile storage, the contents of
   <factory > MUST persist across restarts

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers one URI in the IETF XML Registry [RFC3688].
   The following registration has been made:

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-factory-default

      Registrant Contact: The IESG.

      XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   This document registers one YANG module in the YANG Module Names
   Registry [RFC6020].  The following registration has been made:

      name: ietf-factory-default

      namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-factory-default

      prefix: fdef

      RFC: xxxx

6.  Security Considerations

   The <reset-datastore> RPC can overwrite important and security
   sensitive information in one of the other datastores e.g. running,
   therefore it is important to restrict access to this RPC using the
   standard access control methods.  [RFC8341]

   The content of the factory-default datastore is usually not security
   sensitive as it is the same on any device of a certain type.

Appendix A.  Open Issues

   o  Do we need a restart after <reset-datastore> ? What kind of
      restart, just the YANG-Server or the full system?

   o  Do we need the concept of reboot?  How is that different from a
      restart?  Does it result in some sort of reset-datastore?

Appendix B.  Difference between <startup> datastore and <factory-
             default> datastore

   When the device first boots up, the content of the <startup> and
   <factory-default> will be identical.  The content of <startup> can be
   subsequently changed by using <startup> as a target in a <copy-
   config> operation.  The <factory-default> is a read-only datastore
   and it is usually static as described in earlier sections.
