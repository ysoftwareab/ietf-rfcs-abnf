                       Abstract 
                        
                       This document proposes an extension format for the Ultra-Lightweight 
                       Encapsulation (ULE) protocol.  The proposed method allows ULE to 
                       carry both optional (with an explicit extension length) and 
                       mandatory (with an implicit extension length) header information to 
                       assist in network/Receiver processing of a SNDU. 
                        
                       These functions modify the behaviour of ULE, and introduce header 
                       processing operations that will simplify the addition of new 
                       headers.  
                        
                       This Internet Draft is presented as a separate document to allow 
                       ipdvb working group discussion of the design trade-offs involved. If 
                       accepted, the techniques will be incorporated within a future 
                       revision of ULE.

                    INTERNET DRAFT  Encapsulation for IP over MPEG-2/DVB     September 2003 
                     
                     
                    1. Introduction 
                        
                       This document describes an extension format for the ULE [ULE] 
                       encapsulation for transport of IP datagrams or other network layer 
                       packets over ISO MPEG-2 Transport Streams [ISO-MPEG].  The 
                       terminology used is defined in [ULE]. 
                        
                     
                    2. Extension Headers  
                     
                       PDUs in ULE [ULE] are encapsulated to form a SNDU. Each SNDU is sent 
                       as an MPEG-2 Payload Unit. The encapsulation format to be used for 
                       PDUs (IP packets and bridged Ethernet frames) is illustrated below 
                       (in these examples, for simplicity we assume D=1, if D=0, a NPA 
                       destination address is inserted directly after the Type field of the 
                       base header if D=1, or the NPA address if D=0: 
                        
                       <--------------------------   SNDU   -------------------------->

                       +---+---------------------------------------------------+--------+ 
                       <- ULE base header   -> 
                        
                       Figure 1: SNDU Encapsulation, with no Extension Header 
                        
                       In ULE, the Type field is assigned an IANA assigned value.  All 
                       values above 1535 (decimal) follow the IEEE/DIX type assignments for 
                       Ethernet. 
                        
                       Values less than 1536 (decimal) indicate a next-layer-header and are 
                       assigned from a separate IANA registry for ULE. 
                        
                       The general format for these next-layer-header fields value is:

                       Where: 
                       D is the ULE D_bit. 
                       T1 is the base header Type field. In this case, it specifies a next-
                       layer-header value. 
                       H1 is a set of fields defined for header type T1.  There may be 0 or 
                       more bytes of header information in a specific ULE extension. 
                       T2 is the Type field of the next header, or an EtherType > 1535 B 
                       indicating the type of the PDU being carried.

                       Figure 3: SNDU Encapsulation, with two Extension Headers 
                     
                       The above figure shows a SNDU that includes two extension headers. 
                       The Type values of T1 and T2 are both less than 1536 (decimal) 
                       indicating the presence of a next-layer-header rather than a 
                       directly following PDU.  Using this method several headers may be 
                       chained in series. 
                        
                       The 16-bit ULE next-layer-header field is used in place of the Type 
                       value. It is organised as a 5-bit zero prefix, a 3-bit H-LEN field 
                       and an 8-bit H-Type field, as follows: 
                        
                       +----+-----+--------+ 
                       |0000|H-LEN| H-TYPE |

                       H-LEN Assignment 
                        
                       0    Indicates a Mandatory Extension Header  
                       1    Indicates an Optional Extension Header of length 2B 
                       2    Indicates an Optional Extension Header of length 4B 
                       3    Indicates an Optional Extension Header of length 6B 
                       4    Indicates an Optional Extension Header of length 8B

                       >=6  the combined H-LEN and H-TYPE values indicate the Ethertype  
                            of a PDU that directly follows this Type field. 
                        
                       A H-LEN of zero indicates a Mandatory Extension Header. Each 
                       specific Mandatory Extension header has a pre-defined length, that 
                       is not communicated in the H-LEN field. No additional limit is 
                       placed on the maximum length of a Mandatory Extension Header. 
                     
                       2.1 Mandatory Extension Headers 
                        
                       The term Mandatory refers to the processing action required to 
                       forward a PDU and not to a requirement to implement an specific 
                       option.  That is, Receivers are NOT required to implement all types 
                       of Mandatory Extension Headers, but MUST process these headers 
                       according to the following rules: A Receiver that receives a ULE 
                       SNDU with a next-layer-header value indicating a Mandatory Extension 
                       Header (i.e. a value less than 255 decimal) has two processing

                       Since the Receiver will suspend processing of a SNDU in case 2, 
                       there is no need for an explicit header length field to indicate the 
                       length of a mandatory extension.  
                        
                       The following mandatory next-layer-header types are defined in the 
                       ULE specification: 
                        
                       0x0000: Test SNDU, discarded by the Receiver 
                       0x0001: Bridged Ethernet Frame  
                       0x0002: Mandatory Odd Encryption Header (see section A.1) 
                       0x0003: Mandatory Even Encryption Header (see section A.1) 
                        
                       The format of additional Mandatory Extension Headers will be 
                       specified in documents separate to the ULE base header, and these 
                       must specify the format and length of the specific extension header.  
                     
                       2.2 Optional Extension Headers 
                        
                       A next-layer-header value greater than or equal to 512 decimal 
                       (0x0100, hexadecimal) and less than 1536 decimal (0x600, 
                       hexadecimal), indicates an Optional Extension Header. When a 
                       Receiver encounters a next-layer-header indicating an Optional 
                       Extension Headers, it MAY be configured to either: 
                        
                            (i) Process the Optional Extension Header.  This requires the 
                            Receiver to parse the bytes contained in this extension header. 
                            After parsing the extension header, the Receiver MAY decide to 
                            modify the processing of the remaining bytes within the SNDU.  
                             
                            (ii) Ignore the Optional Extension Header. The Receiver MUST 
                            skip the number of bytes corresponding to the Extension header 
                            length (H-LEN), before reading the Type value that follows the 
                            extension header.   
                        
                       The chosen processing depends upon the set of implemented Optional 
                       Extension Headers and the Receiver configuration. The length of each 
                       Optional Extension Header (in 2-byte words, including the extension 
                       payload type that follows each header) is implicit in the high-order 
                       byte of the extension type. This header length, is known as the H-
                       LEN value. All Receivers MUST validate the H-LEN value, if this 
                       value would cause the total header length to exceed the SNDU Length, 
                       the Receiver MUST discard the SNDU. The Receiver SHOULD record an 
                       illegal extension length error.

                       Receiver. 
                        
                        
                       The format of other extension header fields will be specified in an 
                       IETF document.  
                        
                        
                    3. Summary 
                        
                       This document defines an extension header format for the Ultra 
                       Lightweight Encapsulation (ULE) to perform efficient and flexible 
                       support for including mandatory and optional SNDU headers. 
                        
                       This document takes several design decisions that need to be 
                       considered by the ipdvb working group: 
                        
                       First, it assumes the need for both optional and Mandatory Extension 
                       Headers.  The authors suggest this is an important protocol 
                       component, since once this function is added, it allows future 
                       extension of the protocol, while providing backwards capability with 
                       existing protocol releases. In particular, Optional Extension 
                       Headers MAY be safely ignored by drivers that do not implement them, 
                       or choose not to process them. 
                        
                       Second, it assumes that headers may be specified using the Type 
                       registry, although in IPv6 a separate registry is used for this 
                       purpose. The rationale for this decision is that it is not expected 
                       that packets will carry a large number of consecutive extension 
                       headers.  The use of a single type space simplifies processing and 
                       saves assignment and the need to maintain multiple IANA registries. 
                       The cost is that a 2 byte value is used, with a small increase in 
                       both overhead and processing cost. 
                        
                       Third, it assumes that the presence of extension headers can be 
                       indicated using the Type field of the base header, rather than by 
                       allocating bits within the header to indicate whether extensions are 
                       present.  This is justified, on the basis of simplified processing 
                       and that it maintains a simple lightweight header for the common 
                       case when no extensions are present. 
                        
                       Fourth, based on discussions within the ipdvb WG, the high-order 
                       byte of the Type 1 header is used to indicate the Length (H-LEN) of 
                       the extension header. This saves establishing a separate field for 
                       this purpose. This reduces the available code-points for Types, but 
                       still leaves adequate space for all envisaged extensions.

                       As in ULE, this document will require IANA involvement: 
                        
                       The payload type field defined in this document must be aligned with 
                       an existing IANA registry or the following values need to be 
                       assigned by the IANA: 
                        
                            ULE Type Field 
                        
                       8.1 IANA Guidelines 
                        
                       The following contains the IANA guidelines for management of the ULE 
                       Next-Protocol-Header registry. 
                        
                             
                       This registry allocates values decimal 0-1535 (0x0000-0x05FF, 
                       hexadecimal). It MUST NOT allocate values greater than 1535

                       4) 768-1023 (decimal) IANA assigned values indicating Optional

                       This annexe to be removed. 
                        
                        
                       The following examples are hypothetical, and it is not the purpose 
                       of this appendix to define these new extensions.  Such extensions 
                       may be defined by other documents or within a future revision of 
                       this ID. The examples are included here only to illustrate how such 
                       extensions may be defined, and are provided for discussion by the 
                       IETF ipdvb working group.

                       The Encryption Extension header format is an example of a Mandatory 
                       Extension Header.  This extension format defines two styles of 
                       extension headers (functionally equivalent to the encryption control 
                       behaviour of DSM-CC/MPE). PDUs that are not encrypted, do NOT 
                       include this header.

                       Note that the final two bytes of the bridging header also have a 
                       Type field.  This is true of all ULE extension headers, but in this 
                       special case the mandatory header format permits this to carry a LLC 
                       Length field, specified by IEEE 802.  Normally this will be an IANA 
                       assigned value. 
                         
                       Similar processing is also performed for SNDUs with D=0.
