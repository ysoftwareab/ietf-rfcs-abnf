1.  Introduction

   Network coding schemes are inherent part of the satellite systems as
   the physical layer requires specific robustness to guarantee an
   efficient usage of the expensive radio resource.  Further exploiting
   these schemes is an opportunity for a better end-user experience
   along with a better exploitation of the scarce resource.

   In this context, this memo aims at:

   o  summing up the current deployment of network coding schemes over
      LEO and GEO satellite systems;

   o  identifying opportunities for further usage of network coding in
      these systems.

1.1.  Glossary

   The glossary of this memo is related to the network coding taxonomy
   document [I-D.irtf-nwcrg-network-coding-taxonomy].

   The glossary is extended as follows:

2.  A note on satellite topology

   The objective of this section is to provide both a generic
   description of the components composing a generic satellite system
   and their interaction.  It provides a high level description of a
   multi-gateway satellites network.  There exist multiple SATCOM
   systems, such as those dedicated to broadcasting TV or to IoT
   applications: depending on the purpose of the SATCOM system, ground
   segments are specific.  This memo lays on SATCOM systems dedicated to
   Internet access that follows the DVB-S2/RCS2 standards.

   In this context, Figure 1 shows an example of a multigateway
   satellite system.  More details on a generic SATCOM ground segment
   architecture for a bi-directional Internet access can be found in
   [SAT2017].

   It is worth noting that some functional blocks aggregate the traffic
   coming from multiple users, allowing the deployment of network coding
   schemes.

   satellite systems.  The information is based on the taxonomy document

   following: End-to-End Coding (E2E), Network Coding (NC), Intra-Flow
   Coding (IntraF), Inter-Flow Coding (InterF), Single-Path Coding (SP)
   and Multi-Path Coding (MP).

   X1 embodies the source coding that could be used at application level
   for instance: for video streaming on a broadband access.  X2 embodies
   the physical layer, applied to the PLFRAME, to optimize the satellite
   capacity usage.  Furthermore, at the physical layer and when random
   accesses are exploited, FEC mechanisms are exploited.

4.  Details on the use cases

   This section details use-cases where network coding schemes could
   improve the overall performance of a SATCOM system (e.g. considering
   a more efficient usage of the satellite resource, delivery delay,
   delivery ratio).

   It is worth noting that these use-cases focus more on the middle ware
   (e.g. aggregation nodes) and packetization UDP/IP of Figure 2.
   Indeed, there are already lots of recovery mechanisms at the physical
   and access layers in currently deployed systems while E2E source
   coding are done at the application level.  In a multigateway SATCOM
   Internet access, the specific opportunities are more relevant in
   specific SATCOM components such as the "network function" block or
   the "access gateway" of Figure 1.

4.1.  Two way relay channel mode

   This use-case considers a two-way communication between end users,
   through a satellite link.  We propose an illustration of this
   scenario in Figure 3.

   Satellite terminal A (resp.  B) transmits a flow A (resp.  B) to a
   server hosting NC capabilities, which forward a combination of the
   two flows to both terminals.  This results in non-negligible
   bandwidth saving and has been demonstrated at ASMS 2010 in Cagliari
   [ASMS2010].  Moreover, with On-Board Processing satellite payloads,
   the network coding operations could be done at the satellite level,
   thus reducing the end-to-end delay of the communication.

4.2.  Reliable multi-cast

   This use-case considers adding redundancy to a multi-cast flow
   depending on what has been received by different end-users, resulting
   in non-negligible scarce resource saving.  We propose an illustration
   for this scenario in Figure 4.

   A multi-cast flow (M) is forward to both satellite terminals A and B.
   On the uplink, terminal A (resp.  B) does not acknowledge the packet
   Ni (resp.  Nj) and either the access gateway or the multi-cast server
   includes the missing packets in the multi-cast flow so that the
   information transfer is reliable.  This could be achieved by using
   NACK-Oriented Reliable Multicast (NORM) [RFC5740].  However, NORM
   does not consider other network coding schemes such as sliding window
   encoding described in [I-D.irtf-nwcrg-network-coding-taxonomy].

4.3.  Hybrid access

   This use-case considers the use of multiple path management with
   network coding at the transport level to either increase the
   reliability or the total bandwidth.  We propose an illustration for
   this scenario in Figure 5.  This use-case is inspired from the
   Broadband Access via Integrated Terrestrial Satellite Systems (BATS)
   project and has been published as an ETSI Technical Report
   [ETSITR2017].  It is worth nothing that this kind of architecture is
   also discussed in the MPTCP working group [I-D.boucadair-mptcp-dhc].

   To cope from packet loss (due to either end-user movements or
   physical layer impairments), network coding could be introduced in
   both the CPE and at the concentrator.

4.4.  Dealing with varying capacity

   This use-case considers the usage of network coding to overcome cases
   where the wireless link characteristics quickly change overtime and
   where the physical layer codes could not be made robust in time.

   This is particularly relevant when end users are moving and the
   channel shows important variations [IEEEVT2001].

   The architecture is recalled in Figure 6.  The network coding schemes
   could be applied at the access gateway or the network function block
   levels to increase the reliability of the transmission.  This use-
   case is mostly relevant for when mobile users are considered or when
   the chosen band induce a required physical layer coding that may
   change over time (Q/V bands, Ka band, etc.).

                          characteristics with NC

4.5.  Improving the gateway handovers

   This use-case considers the recovery of packets that may be lost
   during gateway handovers.  Whether this is for off-loading one given
   equipment or because the transmission quality is not the same on each
   gateway, changing the transmission gateway may be relevant.  However,
   if gateways are not properly synchronized, this may result in packet
   loss.  During these critical phases, network coding can be added to
   improve the reliability of the transmission and propose a seamless
   gateway handover.

   An example architecture for this use-case is showed in Figure 7.  It
   is worth noting that depending on the ground architecture
   [I-D.chin-nfvrg-cloud-5g-core-structure-yang] [SAT2017], some
   equipments might be communalised.

4.6.  Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networks

   Establishing communications from terrestrial gateways to aerospace
   components is a challenge due to the distances involved.  As a matter
   of fact, reliable end-to-end (E2E) communications over such links
   must cope with long delay and frequent link disruptions.  Delay/
   Disruption Tolerant Networking [RFC4838] is a solution to enable
   reliable internetworking space communications where both standard ad-
   hoc routing and E2E Internet protocols cannot be used.  DTN can also
   be seen as an alternative solution to cope with satellite
   communications usually managed by PEP.  Therefore, the transport of
   data over such networks requires the use of replication, erasure
   codes and multipath protocol schemes [WANG05] [ZHANG06] to improve
   the bundle delivery ratio and/or delivery delay.  For instance,
   transport protocols such as LTP [RFC5326] for long delay links with
   connectivity disruptions, use Automatic Repeat-reQuest (ARQ) and
   unequal error protection to reduce the amount of non-mandatory
   retransmissions.  The work in [TOURNOUX10] proposed upon LTP a robust
   streaming method based on an on-the-fly coding scheme, where encoding
   and decoding procedures are done at the source and destination nodes,
   respectively.  However, each link path loss rate may have various
   order of magnitude and re-encoding at an intermediate node to adapt
   the redundancy can be mandatory to prevent transmission wasting.
   This idea has been put forward in
   [I-D.zinky-dtnrg-random-binary-fec-scheme] and
   [I-D.zinky-dtnrg-erasure-coding-extension], where the authors
   proposed an encoding process at intermediate DTN nodes to explore the
   possibilities of Forward Error Correction (FEC) schemes inside the
   bundle protocol [RFC5050].  Another proposal is the use of erasure
   coding inside the CCSDS (Consultative Committee for Space Data

   Systems) architecture [COLA11].  The objective is to extend the CCSDS
   File Delivery Protocol (CFDP) [CCSDS-FDP] with erasure coding
   capabilities where a Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) [RFC6816] code
   with a large block size is chosen.  Recently, on-the-fly erasure
   coding schemes [LACAN08] [SUNDARARAJAN08] [TOURNOUX11] have shown
   their benefits in terms of recovery capability and configuration
   complexity compared to traditional FEC schemes.  Using a feedback
   path when available, on-the-fly schemes can be used to enable E2E
   reliable communication over DTN with adaptive re-encoding as proposed
   in [THAI15].

5.  Discussion on the deployability

   This section discusses the deployability of the use-cases detailed in
   Section 4.

   SATCOM systems typically feature Proxy-Enhanced-Proxy RFC 3135
   [RFC3135] which could be relevant to host network coding mechanisms
   and thus support the use-cases that have been discussed in Section 4.
   In particular the discussion on how network coding can be integrated
   inside a PEP with QoS scheduler has been proposed in RFC 5865
   [RFC5865].

   The generic architecture proposed in Figure 1 may be mapped to
   cellular networks as follows: the 'network function' block gather
   some of the functions of the Evolved Packet Core subsystem, while the
   'access gateway' and 'physical gateway' blocks gather the same type
   of functions as the Universal Mobile Terrestrial Radio Access
   Network.  This mapping extends the opportunities identified in this
   draft since they may be also relevant for cellular networks.

   Related to the foreseen virtualized network infrastructure, the
   network coding schemes could be proposed as VNF and their
   deployability enhanced.  The architecture for the next generation of
   SATCOM ground segments would rely on a virtualized environment.  This
   trend can also be seen, making the discussions on the deployability
   of network coding in SATCOM extendable to other deployment scenarios
   [I-D.chin-nfvrg-cloud-5g-core-structure-yang].  As one example, the
   network coding VNF functions deployment in a virtualized environment
   is presented in [I-D.vazquez-nfvrg-netcod-function-virtualization].
