a=    The algorithm used to generate the signature (plain-text;
         REQUIRED).  Verifiers MUST support "rsa-sha256"; Signers MUST
         sign using "rsa-sha256".  See [RFC6376] Section 3.3 (as updated
         by this document) for a description of the algorithms.

sig-a-tag-h     = "sha256" / x-sig-a-tag-h

key-h-tag-alg   = "sha256" / x-key-h-tag-alg
