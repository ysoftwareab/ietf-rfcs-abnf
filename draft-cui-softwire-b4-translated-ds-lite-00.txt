          B4 translated DS-lite enable AFTR to serve more B4s
              draft-cui-softwire-b4-translated-ds-lite-00

Abstract

   The well known Dual Stack lite (DS-lite) technology does great
   contribution to the deployment of IPv6 and alleviate the shortage of
   IPv4 address by making it possible to share a single IPv4 address
   between many hosts.  However, the original DS-lite model make AFTR
   the bottleneck of whole system, thus AFTR's efficiency limits the
   capability of whole DS-lite model.  This draft proposes a B4-
   translated Ds-lite to alleviate the burden of AFTR so that AFTR is
   able to serve more B4s.

1.  Introduction

   B4-translated DS-lite is a variant of original DS-
   lite[I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite], it alleviates the burden of
   AFTR, thus to increase the throughput of AFTR.

   In DS-lite deployment, a single AFTR might serves thousands of B4s.
   In this condition, the efficiency of AFTR becomes the bottleneck of
   whole system.  It is desirable to increase the AFTR's efficiency.  If
   the AFTR can be more efficient, a single AFTR is able to serve more
   B4s.

   AFTR takes charge of packet encapsulation/decapsulation, packet
   forwarding and address translation.  In the three operations, address
   translation is a heavy job, because address translation involves
   searching mapping table, which might consist of tens of thousands of
   entries.  When the search algorithm is implemented by hardware, a
   large mapping table will cost a great amount of hardware resources on
   AFTR.In the meantime, the address translation is the only operation
   that can be moved to B4 side.

   On the contrary, B4 is only responsible for encapsulation/
   decapsulation and there are many B4s served by a single AFTR, thus
   moving the address translation to B4 side will not add much burden to
   a single B4.

   In conclusion, it is desirable to move address translation from AFTR
   to B4 side, it is feasible, and enables a single AFTR to serve more
   B4s.this draft proposed the B4-translated DS-lite to enable AFTR to
   serve more B4s by moving address translation to B4 side.

3.  B4-translated DS-lite deployment

   This section describle the steps when a host behind B4 communicates
   with another host resides in Internet.

3.1.  Handle outbound packets

   The B4 must know the external address and port in order to do address
   translation, thus the B4 must first establish mapping before
   traslation.

   In B4-translated DS-lite mechanism, it is suggested that the hosts
   are not aware of mapping establishment in B4.  Figure 1 shows an
   example of mapping establishment in B4.  In this example, the mapping
   establishment is conducted automatically when a packet, which
   contains an unknown source address-port combination, arrives.


             host                   B4                   AFTR
             |----(1)-------------->|                      |
             |                      |---------(2)--------->|
             |                      |<--------(3)----------|
             |                      |---------(4)--------->|


   Figure 1 Mapping establishment

   1.  A host connected to a server on Internet, so it sends a packet to
       its default gateway, which is B4.  If the B4 knows the
       corresponding external address of the source address, jump to
       step 4.

   2.  Gateway which functions as B4, obtains the source address-port of
       the outbound packet and requests to AFTR for a corresponding
       external address-port.

   3.  AFTR allocates an external address-port and responds to B4.When
       B4 receives this response, it records the internal address,
       internal port, external address and external port in a mapping
       table.  This mapping table will be used to support the address
       translation of each received packet.

   4.  B4 does the address translation to the packet according to the
       mapping table and encapsulate this packet before sending it to
       AFTR.  When AFTR receives this packet, it first records the
       source ipv4 address, source port number and ipv6 address of
       corresponding tunnel end point and then decapsulates the packet
       and forwards it to Internet.The source ipv4 address, source port

       number and ipv6 address comprise an entry of encapsulation table.
       This table will be used when inbound packets arrive.

3.2.  Handle inbound packets

   When an inbound packet arrives at AFTR, AFTR checks the destination
   address-port and search the encapsulation table.  Then AFTR
   encapsulate the packet and send it to its corresponding B4.

   When B4 receive the inbound packet, it simply decapsulate the packet,
   replace its destination address and port number and send it to the
   host.

4.  Port request

4.1.  Port request mechanism

   In 3.1., B4 has the demand to learn the external address and port for
   the sake of successful address translation.  Pinhole Control
   Protocol(PCP)[I-D.wing-softwire-port-control-protocol]can be
   leveraged to make needs meet.

   PCP is primarily used to enalbe PCP client to control how inbound
   packets are forwarded by upstream NAT devices so as to behave as a
   serve.  Thus it enables PCP client to learn the external address and
   port.  So the B4-translated DS-lite can leveraged Pinhole Control
   Protocol (PCP) mechanism to request ports.

4.2.  Port request policy

   There are two strategy for B4 to request ports.

   One is to request on demand, which means that B4 only request for a
   new port when a packet, which can not be translated, arrives.  This
   strategy has a main drawback that port request is called when each
   traffic flow begins.  Every flow is subjected to a request and
   responce, which will increase the latency of packet sending.

   The other one is to request several ports at a time, thus the B4 can
   handle more outbound packets without another request.With this
   strategy, B4 is responsible for port management and original PCP
   request MUST be extended to support requesting a series of port
   number.  This strategy also have drawbacks because it might due to
   the inefficient use of port sources.

   The request policy can be adjusted according to the demand of service
   provider.
