            Discussion beyond English on IETF mailing lists
                draft-wood-discussion-beyond-english-00

Abstract

   The IETF requires English for technical discussion in working groups,
   in working group documents and in anything considered for
   publication.  Use of English simplifies overhead and makes for clear
   discussion of a single document in a single language, but
   disadvantages those who lack fluency and comfort in English.

   This document proposes setting up talk mailing lists for languages
   other than English, where technical matters can be discussed in
   comfort, and perhaps even be written up in internet-draft form in a
   language other than English.  Once technical ideas are in place, a
   draft can move forward to a working group in English.

   Exposing non-English speakers to the IETF will, in the interests of
   diversity, allow them to gain familiarity with IETF processes while
   discussing with other fluent speakers of their language.  This
   benefits the IETF by attracting a broader constituency while meeting
   its diversity goals.

Status of This Memo

   This Internet-Draft is submitted to IETF in full conformance with the
   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

   Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering
   Task Force (IETF).  Note that other groups may also distribute
   working documents as Internet-Drafts.  The list of current Internet-
   Drafts is at http://datatracker.ietf.org/drafts/current/.

   Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months
   and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any
   time.  It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference
   material or to cite them other than as "work in progress."

   This Internet-Draft will expire on May 23, 2017.

1.  Introduction to Proposal

   We propose that the IETF set up a number of non-working-group mailing
   lists for discussion in different languages.  These can be run as
   talk-[ISO639 language code]@ietf.org, e.g. talk-ja@ietf.org for
   Japanese, talk-zh@ietf.org for Chinese, etc [ISO639].

   Experienced IETFers fluent in each language can volunteer and be
   assigned to guide each discussion, explaining IETF matters, and
   dealing with technical issues.  They can guide ideas to draft form in
   the appropriate language, and eventually to the IETF's working
   language of English.  A list in the language can be set it up if one
   or two IETFer guides are available and willing to follow discussion.

2.  Details considered

   For simplicity and clarity, ISO-639-1:2002 two-letter coding takes
   precedence.  More complex codings are unlikely to be required at this
   early stage.

   While working group discussion is in English and working group drafts
   are in English, and normally in ASCII, there is nothing requiring

   individual internet-drafts to be in English or in ASCII.  Other forms
   of individual draft, e.g. portable document format (pdf), are
   suitable for non-Roman transcriptions.

   talk-en@ietf.org is arguably redundant, as the main IETF mailing
   list, ietf@ietf.org, has general English discussion.  However, a
   place where English-speaking newcomers to the IETF feel more welcome
   before diving into technical workgroup discussion may be appropriate.

   Discussion in Asian language around e.g. local DNS use may be a
   useful starting point for this proposal.

3.  Security Considerations

   Opening more mailing lists in more languages raises questions about
   keeping discussion appropriate to the IETF, rather than veering
   offtopic to e.g. local political issues, and questions of IETF limits
   of scope and liability must be answered.  The mailing list rules of
   the IETF apply here.  Translating those rules into the local language
   and periodically informing new subscribers of them and keeping
   discussion on-topic will be necessary.

4.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations.

5.  Acknowledgements

   We thank the IETF mailing list for much discussion of diversity.
