  Abstract 
      
     Seamoby Candidate Access Router Discovery protocol and Context Transfer 
     Protocol are experimental protocols designed to accelerate IP handover 
     between wireless access routers. These protocols require IANA allocations 
     for ICMP types, SCTP Payload Protocol Identifiers, port numbers, and 
     registries for certain formatted message options. This document contains 
     instructions to IANA about what allocations are required.

   1.0    Introduction 
      
     The Seamoby Candidate Access Router Discovery (CARD) protocol [1] and 
     Context Transfer Protocol (CTP) [2] are experimental protocols designed to 
     accelerate IP handover between wireless access routers. These protocols 
     require IANA allocations for ICMP options and type, SCTP Payload Protocol 
     Identifiers and port number, and establishment of registries for certain 
     formatted message options. Because the protocols are experimental, there is 
     no guarantee that they will ever see widespread deployment in their current 
     form. Consequently, it seems prudent to conserve Internet numbering 
     resources that might be needed for other protocols which could see wider 
     deployment. This draft contains instructions to IANA for the Seamoby 
     protocols. 
      
     The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
     "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
     document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3]. 
      
   2.0    Common IPv4 and IPv6 Allocations 
      
     IANA SHALL assign one SCTP Payload Protocol Identifier, designated "CTP", 
     for the Context Transfer Protocol, and one SCTP Payload Protocol Identifier, 
     designated "CARD", for the Candidate Access Router Discovery protocol. These 
     are used to differentiate inter-router CARD and CTP messages on the SCTP 
     port. 
      
   3.0    IPv4 Allocations 
      
     IANA SHALL assign one ICMP type for IPv4 identifying Seamoby protocol ICMP 
     messages. See Section 5.1.1 of [1] for a description of Seamoby CARD ICMP 
     messages, and Section 3.2 of [2] for the CTP ICMP messages. Furthermore, the 
     IANA SHALL assign the following codes under the Seamoby ICMP type: 
      
           Code                 Purpose                      Reference 
         ----------------------------------------------------------------- 
             0       CARD host to router signaling    Section 5.1.1 of [1] 
             1       CTP host to router signaling     Section 3.2 of [2] 
      
     IANA SHALL assign one SCTP port number for IPv4 for use by the Seamoby 
     protocols. See Section 5.2.1 of [1] for a description of inter-access router 
     CARD protocol use of SCTP, and Section 3.1 of [2] for a description of the 
     inter-access router CTP use of SCTP. 
      
     IANA SHALL assign Mobile IPv4 Foreign Agent Discovery [5] option type codes 
     for the following:

   4.0    IPv6 Allocations 
      
     IANA SHALL assign one ICMP type code for IPv6 identifying Seamoby protocol 
     ICMP messages. See Section 5.1.1 of [1] for a description of Seamoby CARD 
     ICMP messages, and Section 3.2 of [2] for the CTP ICMP messages. 
     Furthermore, the IANA SHALL assign the following codes under the Seamoby 
     ICMP type: 
      
           Code                 Purpose                      Reference

             1       CTP host to router signaling     Section 3.2 of [2] 
      
     IANA SHALL assign one SCTP port number for IPv6 for use by the Seamoby 
     protocols. See Section 5.2.1 of [1] for a description of inter-access router 
     CARD protocol use of SCTP, and Section 3.1 of [2] for a description of the 
     inter-access router CTP use of SCTP. 
      
     IANA SHALL assign IPv6 RFC 2461 Neighbor Discovery [4] option type codes for 
     the following:

   5.0    Candidate Access Router Discovery Protocol Registries 
      
     CARD requires two registries: 
      
        1) An AVP type registry,  
        2) A Layer 2 access technology identifier registry. 
      
     These are described in the following subsections. 
      
  5.1 AVP Type Registry 
   
     The AVP Type Registry allows future expansion of the CARD AVP type space to 
     include new AVPs. AVP Type codes are 16 bit unsigned integers. See Section 
     5.1.4 of [1] for a description of AVPs.  
      
     The registry SHALL be initially populated with the following table: 
      
                 AVP Name                            Type Code 
                 ----------------------------------------------  
                 RESERVED                                0x00

     Internet Draft        Seamoby IANA Allocations                   May, 2004 
      
     Assignment of AVP type codes SHALL be by the Method of Designated Expert. 
     The responsible IETF Area Director for the area SHALL appoint the Designated 
     Expert. 
      
  5.2 Layer 2 Access Technology Identifier Registry 
      
     The Layer 2 Access Technology Identifier registry allows the registration of 
     type codes to uniquely identify specific access technologies in the L2-Type 
     field of the CARD L2 ID sub-option. L2 ID codes are 8 bit unsigned integers. 
     See Section 5.1.3.1 of [1] for a description of the CARD L2 ID sub-option. 
      
     The registry SHALL initially be populated with the following table: 
      
                 Layer 2 Access Technology            Type Code 
                 ----------------------------------------------  
                 RESERVED                                0x00 
                 IEEE 802.3 (Ethernet)                   0x01 
                 IEEE 802.11a                            0x02 
                 IEEE 802.11b                            0x03 
                 IEEE 802.11g                            0x04 
                 IEEE 802.15.1(Bluetooth)                0x05 
                 IEEE 802.15.3                           0x06 
                 IEEE 802.15.4                           0x07 
                 IEEE 802.16                             0x08 
      
     Assignment of Layer 2 Access Technology identifiers SHALL be on the basis of 
     request to IANA. All requests MUST be accompanied by a reference to a 
     technical document in which the design of the Layer 2 access technology is 
     described.  
      
   6.0    Context Transfer Protocol Registry 
      
     CTP requires one registry: a registry of context Feature Profile Type 
     identifiers. Feature Profile Type identifiers are 16 bit unsigned integers 
     that identify particular types of feature contexts. See Section 2.4 of [2] 
     for a description of how contexts are carried in CTP. 
      
     The registry SHALL initially be populated with the following table: 
      
                 Context Profile                      Type Code 
                 ----------------------------------------------  
                 RESERVED                                0x00 
                 IPv6 Multicast Listener Context         0x01 
      
     Future allocations of Feature Profile Type codes SHALL be done by the Method 
     of Designated Expert.  For registration requests where a Designated Expert 
     is consulted, the responsible IESG area director SHALL appoint the 
     Designated Expert. 
      
      
   7.0    Expiration 
      
     The Seamoby Working Group requests that IANA maintain allocations for the 
     port number and ICMP message type number for a minimum of 3 years from the

     publication of this document after which the allocations SHOULD be released, 
     unless IETF Working Group standardization of the Seamoby protocols is 
     underway for advancing the protocols in some form to Proposed Standard. If 
     either of the Seamoby protocols are advanced to Proposed Standard, the IANA 
     Considerations section in the respective Standards Track document MUST 
     contain a description of how the allocations in this document should be 
     disposed of.
