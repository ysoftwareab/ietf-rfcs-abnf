     1. Introduction

     This document describes terminology for the benchmarking of
     devices that implement traffic control based on IP precedence or
     diff-serv code point criteria.

     New terminology is needed because most existing measurements
     assume the absence of congestion and only a single per-hop-
     behavior. This document introduces several new terms that will
     allow measurements to be taken during periods of congestion.

  Perser, Newman, Khurana, Erramilli, Poretsky                  [Page 2]

  INTERNET-DRAFT       Terminology for Benchmarking            June 2002
                 Network-layer Traffic Control Mechanisms


     Another key difference from existing terminology is the definition
     of measurements as observed on egress as well as ingress of a
     device/system under test. Again, the existence of congestion
     requires the addition of egress measurements as well as those
     taken on ingress; without observing traffic leaving a
     device/system it is not possible to say whether traffic-control
     mechanisms effectively dealt with congestion.

     The principal measurements introduced in this document are vectors
     for rate, delay, and jitter, all of which can be observed with or
     without congestion of the DUT/SUT.

     This document describes only those terms relevant to measuring
     behavior of a device or a group of devices using one of these two
     mechanisms. End-to-end and service-level measurements are beyond
     the scope of this document.


     2.  Existing definitions

     RFC 1242 "Benchmarking Terminology for Network Interconnect
     Devices" and RFC 2285 "Benchmarking Terminology for LAN Switching
     Devices" should be consulted before attempting to make use of this
     document.

     RFC 2474 "Definition of the Differentiated Services Field (DS
     Field) in the IPv4 and IPv6 Headers" section 2, contains
     discussions of a number of terms relevant to network-layer traffic
     control mechanisms and should also be consulted.

     For the sake of clarity and continuity this RFC adopts the
     template for definitions set out in Section 2 of RFC 1242.
     Definitions are indexed and grouped together in sections for ease
     of reference.

     The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
     NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
     "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
     RFC 2119.


     3. Term definitions

     3.1 Configuration Terms


     3.1.1 Classification

        Definition:
          Selection of packets based on the contents of packet header
          according to defined rules.

  Perser, Newman, Khurana, Erramilli, Poretsky                  [Page 3]

  INTERNET-DRAFT       Terminology for Benchmarking            June 2002
                 Network-layer Traffic Control Mechanisms


        Discussion:
          Packets can be selected based on the DS field or IP
          Precedence in the packet header.  Classification can also be
          based on Multi-Field (MF) criteria such as IP Source and
          destination addresses, protocol and port number.

          Classification determines the per-hop behaviors and traffic
          conditioning functions such as shaping and dropping that are
          to be applied to the packet.


        Measurement units:
           n/a

        See Also:


     3.1.2 Codepoint Set

        Definition:
          The set of all DS Code-points or IP precedence values used
          during the test duration.

        Discussion:
          Describes all the code-point markings associated with packets
          that are input to the DUT/SUT.  For each entry in the
          codepoint set, there are associated vectors describing the
          rate of traffic, delay, loss, or jitter containing that
          particular DSCP or IP precedence value.

          The treatment that a packet belonging to a particular code-
          point gets is subject to the DUT classifying packets to map
          to the correct PHB. Moreover, the forwarding treatment in
          general is also dependent on the complete set of offered
          vectors.

          n/a

     3.1.3 Congestion

        Definition:
          A condition in which one or more egress interfaces are
          offered more packets than are forwarded at any given instant.

        Discussion:
          This condition is a superset of the overload definition [2].
          The overload definition assumes the congestion is introduced

  Perser, Newman, Khurana, Erramilli, Poretsky                  [Page 4]

  INTERNET-DRAFT       Terminology for Benchmarking            June 2002
                 Network-layer Traffic Control Mechanisms

          strictly by the tester on ingress of a DUT/SUT. That may or
          may not be the case here.

          Another difference between congestion and overload occurs
          when the SUT comprises multiple elements, in that congestion
          may occur at multiple points. Consider an SUT comprising
          multiple edge devices exchanging traffic with a single core
          device. Depending on traffic patterns, the edge devices may
          induce congestion on multiple egress interfaces on the core
          device. In contrast, overload [1] deals only with overload on
          ingress.

          Ingress observations alone are not sufficient to cover all
          cases in which congestion may occur. A device with an
          infinite amount of memory could buffer an infinite amount of
          packets, and eventually forward all of them. However, these
          packets may or may not be forwarded during the test duration.
          Even though ingress interfaces accept all packets without
          loss, this hypothetical device may still be congested.

          The definition presented here explicitly defines congestion
          as an event observable on egress interfaces. Regardless of
          internal architecture, any device that cannot forward packets
          on one or more egress interfaces is congested.

        Measurement units:
           n/a

        See Also:


     3.1.4 Congestion Management

        Definition:
          An implementation of one or more per-hop-behaviors to avoid
          or minimize the condition of congestion.

        Discussion:
          Congestion management may seek either to control congestion
          or avoid it altogether. Such mechanisms classify packets
          based upon IP Precedence or DSCP settings in a packet's IP
          header.

          Congestion avoidance mechanisms seek to prevent congestion
          before it actually occurs.

          Congestion control mechanisms gives one or flows (with a
          discrete IP Precedence or DSCP value) preferential treatment
          over other classes during periods of congestion.

        Measurement units:
           n/a

        See Also:


     3.1.5 Flow

        Definition:
          A flow is a one or more of packets sharing a common intended
          pair of source and destination interfaces.

        Discussion:
          Packets are grouped by the ingress and egress interfaces they
          use on a given DUT/SUT.

          A flow can contain multiple source IP addresses and/or
          destination IP addresses.  All packets in a flow must enter
          on the same ingress interface and exit on the same egress
          interface, and have some common network layer content.

          Microflows [3] are a subset of flows.  As defined in [3],
          microflows require application-to-application measurement. In
          contrast, flows use lower-layer classification criteria.
          Since this document focuses on network-layer classification
          criteria, we concentrate here on the use of network-layer
          identifiers in describing a flow. Flow identifiers also may
          reside at the data-link, transport, or application layers of
          the ISO model. However, identifiers other than those at the
          network layer are out of scope for this document.

          A flow may contain a single code point/IP precedence value or
          may contain multiple values destined for a single egress
          interface.  This is determined by the test methodology.

     3.2 Measurement Terms


     3.2.1 Channel Capacity

        Definition:
          The maximum forwarding rate [2] at which none of the offered
          packets are dropped by the DUT/SUT.

        Discussion:
          Channel capacity measures the packet rate at the egress
          interface(s) of the DUT/SUT. In contrast, throughput as
          defined in RFC 1242 measures the packet rate is based on the
          ingress interface(s) of the DUT/SUT.

          Ingress-based measurements do not account for congestion of
          the DUT/SUT. Channel capacity, as an egress measurement, does
          take congestion into account.

          Understanding channel capacity is a necessary precursor to
          any measurement involving congestion.  Throughput numbers can
          be higher than channel capacity because of queueing.

          This measurement differs from forwarding rate at maximum
          offered load (FRMOL) [2] in that it is intolerant of loss.

        Measurement units:
           N-octet packets per second

        See Also:
          Throughput [1]
          Forwarding Rate at Maximum Offered Load [2]


     3.2.2 Conforming

        Definition:
          Packets which lie within specific rate, delay, or jitter
          bounds.

        Discussion:
          A DUT/SUT may be configured to allow a given traffic class to
          consume a given amount of bandwidth, or to fall within
          predefined delay or jitter boundaries. All packets that lie
          within specified bounds are then said to be conforming,
          whereas those outside the bounds are nonconforming.

     3.2.3 Nonconforming

        Definition:
          Packets that do not lie within specific rate, delay, or
          jitter bounds.

        Discussion:
          A DUT/SUT may be configured to allow a given traffic class to
          consume a given amount of bandwidth, or to fall within
          predefined delay or jitter boundaries. All packets that do
          not lie within these bounds are then said to be
          nonconforming.

        Measurement units:
           n/a

        See Also:
          Expected Vector
          Forwarding Vector
          Offered Vector
          Conforming


     3.2.4 Delay

        Definition:
          The time interval starting when the last bit of the input IP
          packet reaches the input port of the DUT/SUT and ending when
          the last bit of the output IP packet is seen on the output
          port of the DUT/SUT.

        Discussion:
          Delay is measured the same regardless of the type of DUT/SUT.
          Latency [1] require some knowledge of whether the DUT/SUT is
          a "store and forward" or a "bit forwarding" device.  The fact
          that a DUT/SUT's technology has a lower delay than another
          technology should be visible.

          By specifying the metric to be inside the Internet protocol,
          the tester is relieved from specifying the start/end for
          every data link layer protocol that IP runs on.  This avoids
          determining if the start/end delimiters are included in the
          frame.  Also heterogeneous data link protocol can be used in
          a test.

          The measurement point at the end closely simulates the way an
          internet datagram is processed.  An internet datagram is not

  INTERNET-DRAFT       Terminology for Benchmarking            June 2002
                 Network-layer Traffic Control Mechanisms

          passed up or down the stack unless it is complete.
          Completion occurs once the last bit of the IP packet has been
          received.

          Delay can be run at any offered load.  Recommend at or below
          the channel capacity for non-congested delay.  For congested
          delay, run the offered load above the channel capacity.

        Measurement units:
           Seconds.

        See Also:
          Latency [1]


     3.2.6 Undifferentiated Response

        Definition:
          The vector(s) obtained when mechanisms used to support diff-
          serv or IP precedence are disabled.

        Discussion:
          Enabling diff-serv or IP precedence mechanisms may impose
          additional processing overhead for packets. This overhead may
          degrade performance even when traffic belonging to only one
          class, the best-effort class, is offered to the device.

          Measurements with "undifferentiated response" should be made
          to establish a baseline.

          The vector(s) obtained with DSCPs or IP precedence enabled
          can be compared to the undifferentiated response to determine
          the effect of differentiating traffic.

        Measurement units:
          n/a



     3.3 Sequence Tracking


     3.3.1 In-sequence Packet

        Definition:
          A received packet with the expected Test Sequence number.

        Discussion:
          In-sequence is done on a stream level. As packets are
          received on a stream, each packet's Test Sequence number is
          compared with the previous packet.  Only packets that match
          the expected are considered in-sequence.

  INTERNET-DRAFT       Terminology for Benchmarking            June 2002
                 Network-layer Traffic Control Mechanisms


          Packets that do not match the expected Test Sequence number
          are counted as _not in-sequence_ or out-of-sequence.  Every
          packet that is received is either in-sequence or out-of-
          sequence.  Subtracting the in-sequence from the received
          packets (for that stream) can derive the out-of-sequence
          count.

          Two types of events will prevent the in-sequence from
          incrementing: packet loss and reordered packets.

        Measurement units:
          Packet count

     3.3.2 Out-of-order Packet

        Definition:
          A received packet with a Test Sequence number less that
          expected.

        Discussion:
          As a stream of packets enter a DUT/SUT, they include a Stream
          Test Sequence number indicating the order the packets were
          sent to the DUT/SUT.  On exiting the DUT/SUT, these packets
          may arrive in a different order.  Each packet that was re-
          ordered is counted as an Out-of-order Packet.

          Certain streaming protocol (such as TCP) require the packets
          to be in a certain order.  Packets outside this are dropped
          by the streaming protocols even though there were properly
          received by the IP layer.  The type of reordering tolerated
          by a streaming protocol varies from protocol to protocol, and
          also by implementation.

          Out-of-order Packet count is based on the worst case
          streaming protocol.  It allows for no reordering.

          Packet loss does not affect the Out-of-order Packet count.
          Only packets that were not received in the order that they
          were transmitted.

     3.3.4 Stream

        Definition:
          A group of packets tracked as a single entity by the traffic
          receiver.  A stream may share a common content such as type
          (IP, UDP), packet size, or payload.

        Discussion:
          Streams are tracked by test sequence number or "unique
          signature field" (RFC 2889).  Streams define how individual
          packet's statistics are grouped together to form an
          intelligible summary.

          Common stream groupings would be by egress interface,
          destination address, source address, DSCP, or IP precedence.
          A stream using test sequence numbers can track the ordering
          of packets as they transverse the DUT/SUT.

          Streams are not restricted to a pair of source and
          destination interfaces as long as all packets are tracked as
          a single entity.  A mulitcast stream can be forward to
          multiple destination interfaces.

     3.3.6 Test Sequence number

        Definition:
          A field in the IP payload portion of the packet that is used
          to verify the order of the packets on the egress of the
          DUT/SUT.

        Discussion:
          The traffic generator sets the test sequence number value and
          the traffic receiver checks the value upon receipt of the
          packet.  The traffic generator changes the value on each
          packet transmitted based on an algorithm agreed to by the
          traffic receiver.

          The traffic receiver keeps track of the sequence numbers on a
          per stream basis.  In addition to number of received packets,
          the traffic receiver may also report number of in-sequence
          packets, number of out-sequence packets, number of duplicate
          packets, and number of reordered packets.

          The recommended algorithm to use to change the sequence
          number on sequential packets is an incrementing value.

     3.4 Vectors
          A vector is a group of packets all containing a specific DSCP
          or IP precedence value.  Vectors are expressed as a pair of
          numbers.  The first is being the particular diff-serv value.
          The second is the metric expressed as a rate, loss
          percentage, delay, or jitter.


     3.4.1 Intended Vector

        Definition:

          A vector describing the rate at which packets having a
          specific code-point (or IP precedence) that an external
          source attempts to transmit to a DUT/SUT.

        Discussion:

          DUT/SUT.

        Discussion:

        Discussion:
          Instantaneous Delay Variation is the absolute value of the
          difference between the delay measurement of two packets
          belonging to the same stream.

          The delay fluctuation between two consecutive packets in a
          stream is reported as the "Instantaneous Delay Variation".
          Instantaneous Delay Variation can be expressed as |D(i) -
          D(i-1)| where D equals the delay and i is the test sequence
          number.  Packets lost are not counted in the measurement.

        Discussion:
          Peak-to-peak Delay Variation Vector is the maximum delay
          minus the minimum delay of the packets (in a vector)
          forwarded by the DUT/SUT.

          Peak-to-peak Delay Variation is not derived from the

     3.4.4.1 Forwarding Vector

        Definition:
          The number of packets per second for all packets containing a
          specific DSCP or IP precedence value that a device can be
          observed to successfully forward to the correct destination
          interface in response to an offered vector.

        Discussion:
          Forwarding Vector is expressed as pair of numbers.  Both the
          specific DSCP (or IP precedence) value AND the packets per
          second value combine to make a vector.

          The Forwarding Vector represents packet rate based on its
          specific DSCP (or IP precedence) value.  It is not
          necessarily based on a stream or flow.  The Forwarding Vector
          may be expressed as per port of the DUT/SUT. However, it must
          be consistent with the Expected Forwarding Vector.

          Forwarding Vector is a per-hop measurement.  The DUT/SUT may
          change the specific DSCP (or IP precedence) value for a
          multiple-hop measurement.

          correct destination interface in response to an offered
          vector.

        Discussion:

          DSCP or IP precedence value.  It is not necessarily based on
          a stream or flow.  The Loss Vector may be expressed as per
          port of the DUT/SUT. However, it must be consistent with the
          Expected Loss Vector

          Loss Vector is a per-hop measurement.  The DUT/SUT may change
          the specific DSCP or IP precedence value for a multiple-hop
          measurement.

        Measurement Units:
          Percentage of offered packets that are not forwarded.

     3.4.4.3 Sequence Vector

        Definition:
          The number of packets per second for all packets containing a
          specific DSCP or IP precedence value that a device can be
          observed to transmit in sequence to the correct destination
          interface in response to an offered vector.

        Discussion:
          Sequence Vector is expressed as pair of numbers.  Both the
          specific DSCP (or IP precedence) value AND the packets per
          second value combine to make a vector.

          The Sequence Vector represents packet rate based on its
          specific DSCP or IP precedence value.  It is not necessarily
          based on a stream or flow.  The Sequence Vector may be
          expressed as per port of the DUT/SUT.  However, it must be
          consistent with the Expected Sequence Vector.

          Sequence Vector is a per-hop measurement.  The DUT/SUT may
          change the specific DSCP or IP precedence value for a
          multiple-hop measurement.

     3.4.4.4 Instantaneous Delay Vector

        Definition:
          The delay for a packet containing specific DSCP or IP
          precedence value that a device can be observed to
          successfully transmit to the correct destination interface in
          response to an offered vector.

        Discussion:
          Instantaneous Delay vector is expressed as pair of numbers.
          Both the specific DSCP (or IP precedence) value AND delay
          value combine to make a vector.

          The Instantaneous Delay Vector represents delay on its
          specific DSCP or IP precedence value.  It is not necessarily
          based on a stream or flow.  The Delay vector may be expressed
          as per port of the DUT/SUT.  However, it must be consistent
          with the Expected Delay vectors.

          Instantaneous Delay Vector is a per-hop measurement.  The
          DUT/SUT may change the specific DSCP or IP precedence value
          for a multiple-hop measurement.

          Instantaneous Delay vector can be obtained at any offered
          load.  Recommend at or below the channel capacity in the
          absence of congestion.  For congested delay, run the offered
          load above the channel capacity.

          Forwarding Vector may contain several Instantaneous Delay
          Vectors.  For every packet received in a Forwarding Vector,
          there is a corresponding Instantaneous Delay Vector.

          precedence value that a device can be observed to
          successfully transmit to the correct destination interface in
          response to an offered vector.

        Discussion:
          Average Delay vector is expressed as pair of numbers.  Both
          the specific DSCP (or IP precedence) value AND delay value
          combine to make a vector.

          The Delay Vector represents delay on its specific DSCP or IP
          precedence value.  It is not necessarily based on a stream or
          flow.  The Delay vector may be expressed as per port of the
          DUT/SUT.  However, it must be consistent with the Expected
          Delay vector.

          The Average Delay Vector is computed by averaging all the
          Instantaneous Delay Vectors for a given vector.

          Average Delay Vector is a per-hop measurement.  The DUT/SUT
          may change the specific DSCP or IP precedence value for a
          multiple-hop measurement.

          Maximum Delay vector is expressed as pair of numbers.  Both
          the specific DSCP (or IP precedence) value AND delay value
          combine to make a vector.

          The Maximum Delay Vector represents delay on its specific
          DSCP or IP precedence value.  It is not necessarily based on
          a stream or flow.  The Maximum Delay vector may be expressed
          as per port of the DUT/SUT.  However, it must be consistent

     3.4.4.8 Instantaneous Delay Variation Vector

        Definition:
          The variation in the delay for two consecutive packets
          containing specific DSCP or IP precedence value that a device
          can be observed to successfully transmit to the correct
          destination interface in response to an offered vector.

        Discussion:
          Instantaneous Delay Variation is the absolute value of the
          difference between the delay measurement of two packets
          belonging to the same stream.

          Jitter vector is expressed as pair of numbers.  Both the
          specific DSCP (or IP precedence) value AND jitter value
          combine to make a vector.

          The delay fluctuation between two consecutive packets in a
          stream is reported as the "Instantaneous Delay Variation".
          Instantaneous Delay Variation can be expressed as |D(i) -
          D(i-1)| where D equals the delay and i is the test sequence
          number.  Packets lost are not counted in the measurement.

     3.4.4.9 Average Delay Variation Vector

        Definition:

          specific DSCP or IP precedence value that a device can be
          observed to successfully transmit to the correct destination

        Discussion:
          Average Delay Variation is the average of all the
          Instantaneous Delay Variation Vectors measured during the
          test duration.

          Average Delay Variation vector is expressed as pair of
          numbers.  Both the specific DSCP (or IP precedence) value AND
          jitter value combine to make a vector.

     3.4.4.10 Peak-to-peak Delay Variation Vector

        Definition:
          The maximum possible variation in the delay for packets
          containing specific DSCP or IP precedence value that a device
          can be observed to successfully transmit to the correct
          destination interface in response to an offered vector.

        Discussion:
          Peak-to-peak Delay Variation Vector is the maximum delay
          minus the minimum delay of the packets (in a vector)
          forwarded by the DUT/SUT.

          Delay Variation vector is expressed as pair of numbers.  Both
          the specific DSCP (or IP precedence) value AND jitter value
          combine to make a vector.

          Peak-to-peak Delay Variation is not derived from the
          Instantaneous Delay Variation Vector. Peak-to-peak Delay
          Variation is based upon all the packets during the test
          duration, not just two consecutive packets.

     4. Security Considerations

          Documents of this type do not directly affect the security of
          the Internet or of corporate networks as long as benchmarking
          is not performed on devices or systems connected to
          production networks.

          Packets with unintended and/or unauthorized DSCP or IP
          precedence values may present security issues. Determining
          the security consequences of such packets is out of scope for
          this document.
