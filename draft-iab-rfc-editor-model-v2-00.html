  <h1 id="rfc.section.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.1">1.</a> Introduction</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">The IAB, on behalf of the Internet technical community, is concerned with ensuring the continuity of the RFC Series, orderly RFC Editor succession, maintaining RFC quality, and RFC document accessibility. The IAB is also sensitive to the concerns of the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) about providing the necessary services in a cost effective and efficient manner.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">The definition of the RFC series is described in RFC 4844 <a href="#RFC4844">[RFC4844]</a>. Section 3.1 defines "RFC Editor": </p>
<p></p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.4">RFC 4844 makes no attempt to explore the internal organization of the RFC Editor. However, RFC 4844 envisions changes in the RFC Editor organizational structure. In discussion with the Internet community, the IAB considered changes that increase flexibility and operational support options, provides for the orderly succession of the RFC Editor, and ensures the continuity of the RFC series, while maintaining RFC quality, maintaining timely processing, ensuring document accessibility, reducing costs, and increasing cost transparency. The model set forth below is the result of those discussions and the experience gained since, as described immediately below, and examines the internal organization of the RFC Editor, while remaining consistent with RFC 4844.  This version of the document also reflects the discussions, as described below, that have occurred since the first efforts to clarify that internal organization.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.5">Note that RFC 4844 uses the term "RFC Editor function" or "RFC Editor" as the collective set of responsibilities for which this memo provides a model for internal organization. This memo defines the term "RFC Series Editor" or "Series Editor" for one of the organizational components.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.6">The RFC Editor model was first approved in October 1, 2008 and has evolved since. During the implementation of version 1 of the model <a href="#RFC5620">[RFC5620]</a> it was quickly realized that the role of the RSE and the oversight responsibilities needed to be structured differently. In order to gain experience with 'running code' a transitional RFC Series Editor was hired who analyzed the managerial environment and provided recommendations. This version of the model is based on his recommendations and the subsequent discussion on the rfc-interest list.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.7">The document, and the resulting structures, will be modified as needed through normal procedures.  The RSE, and the IAB, through the RFC oversight committee (see <a href="#RSOC">Section 4.1</a>), will continue to monitor discussions within the community about potential adjustments to the RFC Editor model and recognizes that the process described in this document may need to be adjusted to align with any changes that result from such discussions, hence the version number in the title.  </p>

            Structure of RFC Series production and process.
</pre>
<p></p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.5">In this model documents are produced and approved through multiple document streams. The four that now exist are described in [RFC4844]. Documents from these streams are edited and processed by the Production Center and published by the Publisher. The RFC Series Editor will exercise executive management over the activities of the RFC Publisher and the RFC Production Center (which can be seen as back office functions) and will be the entity that: </p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Provides Executive Management for the overall operation of the RFC Editor, including the Production and Publication components.</li>
<li>Represents the RFC Series and the RFC Editor Function within the IETF and externally.</li>
<li>Is responsible for planning and seeing to the execution of improvements in the RFC Editor Production and Access Processes.</li>
<li>Leads the community in the development of improvements to the RFC Series.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.7">These responsibilities are defined below, although the specific work items under them are a matter for the actual employment contract and its Statement of Work.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.8">The IAB and IAOC maintain their chartered responsibility.  More details on the oversight by the IAB via the RSOC can be found in <a href="#RSOC">Section 4.1</a>.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.9">The RSE does not have the authority to hire or fire RFC Editor contractors or personnel.  Serious issues, such as those that might be detected during the RSE annual review of the production facility, would be brought by the RSE to the RSOC, and escalated from there if appropriate.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.3.1">3.1.</a> <a href="#RSE" id="RSE">RFC Series Editor</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.1">The RFC Series Editor is the individual with overall responsibility for the quality, continuity, and evolution of the RFC Series.  While that individual may, in the future, have assistants; at present there are no staff other than those associated with the RFC Series Production and Publication facility.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.2">The RSE is appointed by the IAB, and hired by the IAOC.  The IAB delegates the direct oversight of the IAB to the RSOC, which it appoints.</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.1.p.1">With respect to the Publication and Production functions, the RSE provides input to the IASA budget, statements of work, and manages vendor selection processes.  The RSE performs annual reviews of the Production and Publication function which are then provided to the RSOC and the IASA.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.1.p.2">Vendor selection is done in cooperation with the streams and under final authority of the IASA.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.1.p.3">Concretely:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>The RSE owns and develops the work definition (the SOW) and manages the vendor search processes.  The work definition is created within the (budgetary) boundary condition that are negotiated with IASA and takes into account the RSE's requirements and community input.</li>
<li>The RSE manages the evaluation process of the bids against the SOW and then provides a recommendation to the IASA.</li>
<li>Final vendor selection is done by the IASA in close consultation with the RSE to ensure that contract terms and other arrangements are consistent with the SOW, consistent with the both RSE's and contractor's requirements to satisfy the contract, and do not conflict with the role of the RSE.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.1.p.5">The IASA has the responsibility to approve the total RSE budget (and the authority to deny it). The RSE has the responsibility to manage all the series functions within that budget.  It is assumed that there is a level of cooperation between RSE and IASA that allows decisions by the IASA to be 'pro forma'.  In case of disagreement, the IAB will attempt to mediate the issue.  If no mutual agreement can be reached, the IAB will make the final decision.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.1.p.6">When budgets have been assigned by IASA the RSE is responsible for managing the RFC Editor to operate within those budgets.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.1.p.7">The RSE primarily supervises the on-going performance of the vendors without asserting direct operational responsibility.  However, the RSE has operational responsibilities for issues that raise above the responsibilities of the publication or publication functions such as cross stream coordination of priorities and other issues.  When the RSE needs to take extra-budgetary or out-of contract measures those actions will be coordinated with IASA.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.1.p.8">Create documentation and structures that will allow for the RFC Series' continuity when circumstances engender the need for the execution of the publication and/or production functions by other vendors.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.1.p.9">For this type of responsibility the RSE is expected to cooperate closely with the IASA and the various streams.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.1.p.10">To prevent actual or apparent problems with conflicts of interest or judgment, the RSE is barred from having any ownership, advisory, or other relationship to the vendors executing the Publication or Production functions except as specified elsewhere in this document.  If necessary, an exception can be made after public disclosure of those relationships and with the explicit permission of the IAB and IASA.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.1.2.1.p.3">Due to the history and nature of the interaction between the RSE and the IETF, certain principles must be understood and adhered to by the RSE in his interactions with the community.

<p id="rfc.section.4.1.1.p.1">The RSOC will operate as a Program of the IAB, with the IAB retaining final responsibility.  The IAB will delegate authority and responsibility to the RSOC as appropriate and as RSOC and RSE relationships evolve.  Like other IAB Programs, the RSOC will include people who are not current IAB members.  The IAB will designate the membership of the RSOC with the goals of preserving effective stability, keeping it small enough to be effective, but large enough to provide general Internet Community expertise, specific IETF expertise, Publication expertise, and stream expertise.  Members serve at the pleasure of the IAB and are expected to bring a balance between short and long term perspective.  Specific input about, and recommendations of, members will be sought from the streams, the IASA, and the RSE.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.1.p.2">The RSE and a person designated to represent the IASA will serve as ex-officio members of the RSOC but either or both can be excluded from its discussions if necessary.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.1.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.1.2">4.1.2.</a> <a href="#dispute" id="dispute">Disagreements Among RFC Editor Entities</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.2.p.1">If during the execution of their activities, a disagreement arises over an implementation decision made by one of the entities in the model, any relevant party should first request a review and reconsideration of the decision.  If that party still disagrees after the reconsideration, that party may ask the RSE to decide or, especially if the RSE is involved, that party may ask the IAB Chair (for a technical or procedural matter) or IAD (for an administrative or contractual one) to mediate or appoint a mediator to aid in the discussions, although neither is obligated to do so.  All parties should work informally and in good faith to reach a mutually agreeable conclusion.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.2.p.2">If such a conclusion is not possible through those informal processes, then the matter must be registered with the RFC Series Oversight Committee. The RSOC may choose to offer advice to the RSE or more general advice to the parties involved and may ask the RSE to defer a decision until it formulates its advice. However, if a timely decision cannot be reached through discussion, mediation, and mutual agreement, the Series Editor is expected to make whatever decisions are needed to ensure the smooth functioning of the RFC Editor function; those decisions are final.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.2.p.3">RSE decisions of this type are limited to the functioning of the process and evaluation of whether current policies are appropriately implemented in the decision or need adjustment. In particular, it should be noted that final decisions about the technical content of individual documents are the exclusive responsibility of the stream approvers for those documents, as shown in the illustration in <a href="#model-figure">Figure 1</a>.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.2.p.4">If a disagreement or decision has immediate or future contractual consequences, the Series Editor must identify the issue to the IAOC and, if the RSAG has provided advice, forward that advice as well. After the IAOC has notified the IAB, the IAD as guided by the IAOC, with advice provided by the Series Editor, has the responsibility to resolve these contractual issues.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.2.p.5">If informal agreements cannot be reached, then formal RSOC review and decision making may be required.  If so, the the RSE must identify the issues involved to the community, so that the community is aware of the situation.  The RSE will the report the issue to the RSOC for formal resolution by the RSOC with confirmation by the IAB in its oversight capacity.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.2.p.6">IAB and community discussion of any patterns of disputes are expected to inform future changes to Series policies including possible updates to this document.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.2">4.2.</a> <a href="#editorial_board" id="editorial_board">Independent Submission Stream Editorial Board</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.1">Today the RFC Editor is supported by an Editorial Board for the review of Independent Submission stream documents. This board is expected to evolve in what we will call the Independent Submission Stream Editorial Board. This volunteer Editorial Board will exist at the pleasure of the ISE, and the members serve at the pleasure of the ISE. The existence of this board is simply noted within this model, and additional discussion of such is considered out of scope of this document.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5">
<a href="#rfc.section.5">5.</a> IANA considerations</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.1">This document defines several functions within the overall RFC  Editor structure, and it places the responsibility for coordination of registry value assignments with the RFC Production Center. The IAOC will facilitate the establishment of the relationship between the RFC Production Center and IANA.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.2">This document does not create a new registry nor does it register any values in existing registries, and no IANA action is required.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.6">
<a href="#rfc.section.6">6.</a> Security considerations</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.1">The same security considerations as those in RFC 4844 apply. The processes for the publication of documents must prevent the introduction of unapproved changes. Since the RFC Editor maintains the index of publications, sufficient security must be in place to prevent these published documents from being changed by external parties. The archive of RFC documents, any source documents needed to recreate the RFC documents, and any associated original documents (such as lists of errata, tools, and, for some early items, non-machine readable originals) need to be secured against failure of the storage medium and other similar disasters.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.2">The IAOC should take these security considerations into account during the implementation of this RFC Editor model.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7">
<a href="#rfc.section.7">7.</a> Acknowledgments</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.1">The RFC Editor model was conceived and discussed in hallways and on mail lists. The first iteration of the text on which this document is based was first drafted by Leslie Daigle, Russ Housley, and Ray Pelletier. In addition to the members of the IAOC and IAB in conjunction with those roles, major and minor contributions were made by (in alphabetical order): Bob Braden, Brian Carpenter, Sandy Ginoza, Alice Hagens, Joel M. Halpern, Alfred Hoenes, Paul Hoffman, John Klensin, Subramanian Moonesamy, and Jim Schaad.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.2">The IAOC members at the time the RFC Editor model was approved were (in alphabetical order): Fred Baker, Bob Hinden, Russ Housley, Ole Jacobsen, Ed Juskevicius, Olaf Kolkman, Ray Pelletier (non-voting), Lynn St.Amour, and Jonne Soininen.  In addition, Marshall Eubanks was serving as the IAOC Scribe.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.3">The IAB members at the time the initial RFC Editor model was approved were (in alphabetical order): Loa Andersson, Gonzalo Camarillo, Stuart Cheshire, Russ Housley, Olaf Kolkman, Gregory Lebovitz, Barry Leiba, Kurtis Lindqvist, Andrew Malis, Danny McPherson, David Oran, Dave Thaler, and Lixia Zhang.  In addition, the IAB included two ex-officio members: Dow Street, who was serving as the IAB Executive Director, and Aaron Falk, who was serving as the IRTF Chair.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.4">The IAB members at the time the this RFC was approved were (in alphabetical order): Marcelo Bagnulo, Gonzalo Camarillo, Stuart Cheshire, Vijay Gill, Russ Housley, John Klensin, Olaf Kolkman, Gregory Lebovitz, Andrew Malis, Danny McPherson, David Oran, Jon Peterson, and Dave Thaler.  </p>
