Abstract

   In order for Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS)
   protocol to continue to support new applications it is required that
   the RADIUS attribute space be extended beyond the current limit of
   255 possible attribute types. This document defines a mechanism to
   extend the base RADIUS attribute types while maintaining backwards
   compatibility as well as compatibility with Diameter.

Internet-Draft      RADIUS Attribute Type Extension        November 2003


1. Introduction

   The Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) Protocol
   RFC2865 [3] defines two classes of attributes. Attributes that belong
   to the RADIUS space; and vendor specific attributes (VSAs).

   VSAs are available to allow vendors (which includes other Standard
   Development Organizations) to support their own extended Attributes
   not suitable for general usage. Where as the attribute that belong to
   RADIUS space are controlled by the IETF and are to be used in
   application that are suitable for general use. These attributes are
   defined in RFCs and are assigned types codes by Internet Assigned
   Number Authority (IANA)IANA [5].

   Attributes that belong to the RADIUS space are allocated a type code
   that is a single octet and hence RADIUS is limited to 255 attributes
   types. Of these 255 attributes types, 101 or so have been assigned.
   Types 192-223 are reserved for experimental use; Types 224-240 are
   reserved for implementation-specific use; and values 241-255 are
   reserved and should not be used. Therefore, as of this writing there
   are approximately 90 types codes that can be allocated to new
   attributes.

   RADIUS evolution must not be hindered by the inability to define new
   RADIUS attributes. This document defines a mechanism to extend the
   RADIUS Attribute space by defining a new scheme to allocate attribute
   type codes.

1.1 Terminology

   The term RADIUS Extended Attribute is the name given to the new
   RADIUS attribute types that are enabled by this document. The RADIUS
   Extended Type contains the new type code that is assigned to the
   RADIUS Extended Attributes.

   Other terms used in this document are explained below:

   To be completed...

1.2 Requirements Language

   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
   of the specification. These words are often capitalized. The key
   words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
   "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
   are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [2].

   An implementation is not compliant if it fails to satisfy one or more

   of the must or must not requirements for the protocols it implements.
   An implementation that satisfies all the must, must not, should and
   should not requirements for its protocols is said to be
   "unconditionally compliant"; one that satisfies all the must and must
   not requirements but not all the should or should not requirements
   for its protocols is said to be "conditionally compliant".

2. Requirements

   This informative section describes the requirements that drive the
   solution used to create the RADIUS Extended Attribute types.

   A fundamental requirement for extending the RADIUS attribute space is
   to maintain backwards compatibility. This means that RADIUS servers
   (proxies) must be able to continue to decode and encode messages even
   though they may not need to understand an attribute that has been
   extended. More specifically, the scheme needs to be compliant with '
   RADIUS RFCs such as RFC2865 [3] and also RADIUS Accounting RFC2866
   [4].

   The scheme should ensure that the extension is large enough so that
   we do not run out of type codes.

   Furthermore, the scheme should align with the Diameter NAS Req
   Application NASREQ [6]. Thereby allowing for the two AAA standards to
   interoperate.

   Although according to the specification the allocation of RADIUS
   attribute type codes has been controlled by IANA, this has not been
   the case in reality. In the real world, certain vendors have grabbed
   attribute type codes that they shouldn't have. The result is that
   many RADIUS deployments had to work around these attribute
   collisions. Therefore, each time a new attribute type is introduced
   it raises the possibility that something will break. The proposed
   scheme must be impervious to this artifact.

3. RADIUS Type Extension

   The solution described in this document uses the Vendor Specific
   attributes RFC2865 [3] to create the RADIUS Extended Attributes.

   Vendor Specific attributes are encoded by using the Vendor-Specific
   (26) attribute followed by Length (1 octet), followed by a 4 octet
   Vendor-Id identified using 3 octets (4 octets really) followed by a
   string which is vendor specific RFC2865 [3].

   We allocate RADIUS the Vendor-Id of zero (0). In essence we are
   assigning the IETF a Vendor-Id which is what other Standard
   Development Organization have done in registering their own
   Vendor-Id.

   RADIUS Extended Attributes are encoded using Vendor Specific
   attributes with Vendor-Id set to zero (0). The string part is encoded
   as one or more RADIUS Extended Attribute(s) as follows:

   o  The first 4 octets represent the RADIUS Extended Type;

   o  The next octet is the length of the Extended Type, which
      represents the length of the Extended Type, the length of the
      length itself and optionally the length of the value; and

   o  The value is 0 or more octets.

   Each VSA MUST contain at least one Extended Attribute, and MAY
   contain more then one Extended Attribute providing the overall length
   does not exceed the maximum length of a RADIUS attribute.

4. Formal Syntax

   The following represents the encoding scheme used for RADIUS Extended
   Attribute(s). The basis of this encoding is the Vendor Specific (26)
   encoding.

   +---------------------------------------------------------------+
   |                    1                   2                   3  |
   |0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1|
   +---------------+---------------+-------------------------------+
   |   Type (26)   |  Length       |      Vendor-Id (0)            |
   +---------------+---------------+-------------------------------+
   |          Vendor-Id(0)         |       Extended-Type           |
   +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
   |          Extended-Type        |     Length    |   Value       |
   +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
   |....
   +----

   Type 26 for Vendor-Specific.

   Length >= 11

   Vendor-Id

   The high-order octet is zero (0) and the low-order 3 octets are zeros
   (0)s representing the RADIUS VSA.

   Extended-Type

   Four (4) Octets. Up-to-date values of the RADIUS Extended-Type field
   are specified in the most recent "Assigned Numbers" IANA [5] . Values
   XXXX-YYYY are reserved.

   Length >= 5

   Value

   Zero (0) or more octets as defined by the Extended-Type.

   The RADIUS VSA MAY contain more then one Extended Attribute.
   Providing the maximum length of the attributes does not exceed the
   maximum length of the a RADIUS attribute (255 octets).

5. Security Considerations

   TBD

6. IANA Considerations

   This solution requires that the IETF be allocated Vendor-Type of zero
   to the IETF.

   It also requires that IANA be set up to manage the RADIUS Extended
   Attributes.

7. Open Issues

   What is the numbering scheme for attributes that will be used by RFC
   writers going forward?  For example today we write user-name(1).
   Going forward, will we write foo-bar(0,1)?

   What is the numbering plan for these attributes? What range should be
   reserved?

   Do we want to allow for attributes that are longer than 255 octets?
   There are examples of that already.  Do we address this issue here or
   do we leave it for another specification?

   We have allocated 4 octets for Extended Type. Is that too much?  Note
   having such a large address space will not conflict with Diameter.
   This is because in Diameter these RADIUS attributes would be encoded
   as VSAs with Vendor ID 0.
