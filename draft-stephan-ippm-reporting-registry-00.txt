Internet-Draft           IPPM Reporting Registry               July 2006


1.  Introduction

   The IPPM WG is working on numerous topics such as the definition of
   composition of metrics [I-D.ietf-ippm-spatial-composition] and a
   composition framework [I-D.ietf-ippm-framework-compagg] ; the
   selection of metrics and parameters for reporting IP Performance
   metrics to users and end users
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-reporting],[I-D.shalunov-ippm-reporting] and
   [I-D.morton-ippm-reporting-metrics]; the storage of an end-user
   metric not defined by the IPPM WG
   [I-D.niccolini-ippm-storetraceroutes].

   The intend of this memo is to set up an IANA registry that collects
   best current practices in terms of reporting IP Performance Metrics
   (IPPM) measurements for composition, to users and to end-users.

   Such a registry will facilitate the WG activity because working on
   one metric application will not preclude to work later on other
   applications of the same metric and on application of metrics being
   currently defined in the future.

   The content of the reporting registry provides relevant information
   such as metrics applicability, default values for a metric, default
   values for a specific application.  These pieces of informations are
   are minor points for IPPM gurus but are still mysterious for other
   experts, users and obvioulsy end-users.

   Each metric application described in the registry gives best current
   practice in terms of default values and reporting of parameters and
   results and may include a default info model human readable and
   machine readable.

   This memo firstly motivates the need of a IPPM reporting registry,
   then it introduces the differents part of the reporting registry.
   Section 4 presents end-users metrics to register in the IANA-IPPM-
   METRICS-REGISTRY.  Section 5 provides the initial version of the IPPM
   reporting registry.  The management of the registry is described is
   the 'IANA considerations' section.

Internet-Draft           IPPM Reporting Registry               July 2006


2.  Motivation

   The IPPM WG has defined 45 metrics including
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-reordering].  They are based on [RFC2330] methodology.
   Definitions clearly distinguish raw measure (singleton), from set of
   measures over a period a time (streams) and from statistics.  To go
   further in reporting metrics it is necessary to classify each metric
   in terms of applicability.  This point is presented in section 3.2
   and a first classification is given in section 5.1 for 'composition',
   'user' and 'end user' metrics.

   Composition of metrics intrinsically relies on collecting results
   performed by remote measurement systems and requires the share of the
   set of metrics that may be combined and the share of parameters that
   should be exchange.  This point is discussed in section 3.4 and sets
   of metrics that may be combined are given in section 5.4.

   Reporting metrics measurement results to users require the
   identification of a set of metrics that may be reported and requires
   the definition of the parameters and of the results that should
   reported.  This point is discussed in section 3.4 and sets of metrics
   that may be reported to user are given in section 5.5.

   Reporting metrics measurement results to end-users require the
   identification of a set of metrics easy to understand and relevant to
   end-user applications.  This point is discussed in section 3.4 and a
   first specification metrics that may be reported to end-users are
   given in section 5.6.

   Reporting implicitly leads to exchange information.  So the need of a
   common and protocol neutral info model is discuted in section 3.3.

3.  Presentation of the registry

   The registry is designed to collect best current practice in terms of
   reporting metric application.  Application may the domain of
   applicability of a metrics like raw measure or a real application
   like VoIP. this approach permits to define metric reporting
   parameters at a global level (i.e any Type-P) or/and for a dedicaced
   application (i.e.  VoIP) without having any collision in the best
   practices registered.

   A default metric application gives the default values as per
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-reporting].

   The registration of the reporting of a metric application (sections
   2, 3 of the registry) includes the description of configurations and
   results information.  It may look like section ' 5.2.1.
   Configuration Information Elements' and section ' 5.2.2.  Results
   Information Elements' of[I-D.niccolini-ippm-storetraceroutes].

   The registry is designed to be supplemented in the future with new
   metric applications.

3.1.  initial version of the registry

   It is in the spirit of this registry to limit the number of initial
   metric applications.  So it focuses on 6 metrics applications like
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-reporting] :-) :
      Composition of metrics to compute an ietfCompOneWayDelayMedian
      metric;
      Composition of metrics to compute an ietfOneWayPktLossAverage
      metric;
      Default values for the usage of ietfOneWayDelayMedian for VoIP;
      Default values for the usage of ietfOneWayPktLossAverage for VoIP;
      Usage of VoIP ground-truth End-user metrics: MOS and R-Factor.

3.2.  Metrics classification part

   This part classifies metrics in terms of application. the criteria
   are 'raw measure', 'collecting', 'network expert', 'user',
   'composition' and 'end-user'.  A metric may belong to several
   criteria.  The usage fo each metrics is then described per criteria.

3.3.  Info model part

   The info model part of the registry defines the information to report
   per metric application.

   The info model of composition of metrics must be machine readable to



Stephan & Barriac       Expires January 29, 2007                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft           IPPM Reporting Registry               July 2006


   help machine-to-machine reporting using NSIS WG model implementation
   or PSAMP WG passive measurement with IPFIX protocols...

   The info model of user and end-users metrics must intrinsically be
   human readable.  Furthermore it must be machine readable to
   facilitate the reporting with technics like Web service.

   The best way to help machine-to-machine communication consists in
   defining the information in a protocol neutral langage like XML.

3.3.1.  data type

   Atomic informations to report correspond to parameters described in
   IPPM metrics definitions.

   The data part of the registry defines a flat list of data type
   corresponding to parameters described in IPPM metrics definitions.

   A data type is defined as per section 5.1 of
   [I-D.niccolini-ippm-storetraceroutes] and may reuse data types
   already defined in [I-D.ietf-ipfix-info] and in
   [I-D.ietf-psamp-info].

3.4.  Reporting rules and parameters

   The report of parameters and results is defined per metric
   application i.e. in the composition part, in the user part or in the
   end-user part of the registry.

   To help machine-to-machine communication the definition parameters
   and results may be defined in a XML schema as per section "6.  Data
   Model for Storing Traceroute Measurements" of
   [I-D.niccolini-ippm-storetraceroutes] .

3.4.1.  Reporting for composition part

   This part of the registry identifies sets of metrics that may be
   composed.  Then it gives the parameters and the results for reporting
   metrics per metric.

3.4.2.  Reporting for users and end-users part

   This part of the registry gives per user metric the parameters and
   the results to report for each relevant metrics and application.

   This part of the registry the parameters and the results to report
   per user and end-user metric.

4.  End-user metrics to register

   This section presents several well-known metrics that must be
   registered in the IANA-IPPM-METRICS-REGISTRY because they are
   intensively used by end-users to monitor the behavior and the
   performance of the network or of their application.

   The request of registration is given in 'IANA Considerations'
   section.

4.1.  traceroute

   As IPPM WG is defining the storage of traceroute measurement results
   in [I-D.niccolini-ippm-storetraceroutes] the metric traceroute must
   be registered in the IANA IPPM METRICS REGISTRY.  Furthermore the
   section 5 of this draft gives the information elements for the
   configuration and for the result of traceroute measurement.  These
   informations elements should be used in the registry for describing
   the report of a traceroute to end-user.

4.2.  metric to measure VoIP quality

4.2.1.  ituTrFactorEmodel

   The R Factor is the output of the E-model planning tool defined in
   ITU-T G.107.Its value is ranged between 0 and 100.  Based on the
   individual values of several transmission parameters (given by
   measurements or by default values), it permits an estimation of the
   end-to-end transmission quality of voice calls as perceived by end-
   users.  Depending on the fact that delay and echo are taken into
   account or not in the computation, the E-model R factors can be
   translated into MOS-CQEN or MOS-LQEN (according to ITU-T P.800.1
   terminology).

4.2.2.  itutMosLqon

   PESQ (perceptual evaluation of speech quality) is the trademark name
   Associated with ITU-T P.862.

   This psychoacoustical (i.e. based on the analysis of speech signal
   characteristics) intrusive (i.e. needing the sending of a reference
   signal) model, associated with the mapping function defined in ITU-T
   P.862.1, allows the determination of MOS-LQON scores(according to
   ITU-T P.800.1 terminology), which is a metric very well correlated
   with human perception of end-to-end quality of voice calls.
   Alternative ways for the determination of MOS-LQON scores are ITU-T
   standard P.563 and P.564, based on non-intrusive (i.e. passive)
   measures, respectively on speech signal and RTP/UDP/IP packets

   information.

4.3.  Discussion on End user metrics registration

   Metrics measuring VoIP quality are orthogonale to IPPM metrics
   because the mesure include not only codecs but give a quality as
   perceived by an end-user.

   At large registering ITU-T metrics close to IPPM ones would help to
   distinguish measurement made using different methodology.

5.  IPPM Reporting Registry

   This section defines the initial version of the registry to be
   maintained by IANA.

5.1.  Metrics classification

   Following is a table of the classification of each metric according
   to its applicability.

   Editor note: all the metric are not present.  Do we need a
   'estimation' category ?

   'ID' is the number IANA assigned to the metric.

   'Name' is the name the editor of the RFC assigned to the metric.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  Management rules of the IPPM REPORTING REGISTRY

   Registrations are done by IANA on the basis of 'Specification
   Required', as defined in [RFC2434].

   A document that defines new metrics reporting rules would have an
   "IANA Considerations" section in which it would describe for each
   section of the registry the reporting aspects to be registered.

6.2.  new section

6.3.  End users metrics to register in IANA-IPPM-METRICS-REGISTRY

   IANA is asked to register the following metrics in the IANA-IPPM-
   METRICS-REGISTRY as described in [RFC4148] .

   ietfTraceRoute OBJECT-IDENTITY
      STATUS current
      DESCRIPTION

         "ietfTraceRoute"
      REFERENCE
         "Reference TODO."
      ::= { ianaIppmMetrics nn } -- IANA assigns nn

   itutMosLqon OBJECT-IDENTITY
      STATUS current
      DESCRIPTION

         "ITU-T MOS-LQON PESQ."
      REFERENCE
         "Reference ITU-T P.862, P.862.1, P.563, P.564, P.800.1."
      ::= { ianaIppmMetrics nn } -- IANA assigns nn

   ituTrFactorEmodel OBJECT-IDENTITY
      STATUS current
      DESCRIPTION

         "ITU-T R-Factor Emodel."
      REFERENCE
         "Reference ITU-T G.107."
      ::= { ianaIppmMetrics nn } -- IANA assigns nn

7.  Security Considerations

   Active measurement: see security section in owd pl, jitter rfcs
   (editor notes: add references).

   Active measurement:
      This method is based on the exchange of packets between one source
      and destinations.  Administrators should secure the configuration
      steps to avoid measurement systems to be abused for denial of
      service attacks.

   passive measurement:
      The generation of packets which match systematically the hash
      function may lead to a DoS attack toward the collector.
      The generation of packets with spoofing adresses may corrupt the
      results without any possibility to detect the spoofing.
   Collecting:

   collection of singletons of raw measure could overload the network
   the measurement controller is attach to.
