1.  Introduction

   In IP access netwok, IP edge device is communated with lots of
   subscribers, which include home gateways and hosts.  In order to keep
   accurate information of these device, IP edge has to execute source
   address validation to make the information related to the subscribers
   processed correctly.  In IPv6 access network, subscriber may use LLA
   (Link Local Address) or ULA (Unique Local Address) to initiate the
   subscriber authentication.  The general approach to obtain a GUA
   (Global Unique Address) address for a subscriber is to make the home
   gateway get a delegated prefix and then home gateway advertises the
   prefix to UEs in home network.  Subscriber generates GUA via
   stateless address configuration.  Figure 1 shows a residential IPv6
   broadband access network which uses DHCP PD[RFC3633] to get the
   delegated prefix and SLACC to obtain the GUA address.

   HGW gets a delegated prefix, say /56, for its home network use.  When
   UE1 tries to connect to the network, it first gets its own LLA/ULA
   address and then uses that address as source IP address for the
   following PANA authentication for subscriber verification.  When the
   authentication succeeds, it sends RS (router solicitation) to HGW and
   HGW replies with RA (router advertisement) with a /64 prefix option
   for SLACC configuration.  UE1 uses the prefix to generate its GUA
   address.  And it uses GUA for the following data transportation.
   When another UE2 tries to connect to the network, it repeats the step
   2 to 7.  However it should be noticed, /64 prefix that HGW sent to
   UE2 visa RA may not be the same one as that sent to UE1.  As IP edge
   only knows /56 it delegated to HGW, there is no native way for IP
   edge to know which address/prefix UE1 and UE2 used within the range
   of the delegated /56 prefix.  As IP session terminates on IP edge, IP
   edge should have the detailed information stored for each session,
   e.g. prefix, address, layer 2 information, etc.  If IP edge wants to
   treat the connections which terminate on UE1 and UE2 as different
   sessions, it needs to know the specific information of each to set up
   correct binding relationship.  This contribution tries to analysis
   the issue and provide some possible ways to let the subscriber's
   address information get validated and let the IP edge know the SLACC
   configuration in home network via PANA,.

2.  Message Flow

   The problem stated in Introduction section indeed is a special case
   of IP address/prefix reconfiguration.  Section 3 of [RFC5193] briefly
   described the possible use cases of IP reconfiguration without giving
   the detailed PANA flow.  To implement IPv6 session information
   binding in broadband access scenario, Figure 2 shows the message flow
   to support subscriber authentication and SLACC configuration in home
   network.  IP edge device retrieves the relevant information from the
   process and performs the necessary session bindings.

   In step 5, PAR(PANA-Auth-request) with EAP sucess payload is sent to
   UE.  'I' bit was set to indicate that UE is required to get a GUA and
   use that GUA for the following message exchange.  When receiving the
   PAR with EAP success, UE starts the SLACC procedures to get the GUA
   address for data communication.  It send the RS(router solicitation)
   to HGW in step 6.  Then in step 7, HGW sends responded RA with

   advertised prefix to UE.  The advertised prefix is within the rage of
   the delegated /56 prefix in step 1 but is with 64-bit length.  UE
   uses the received /64 prefix to generate a GUA in step 8,which is to
   be used in the data communication.  In step 9 UE sends PAN(PANA-Auth-
   Answer) with 'C' bit set to IP edge.  GUA address generated in step 8
   should be used as the source IP address.  When IP edge receives PAN,
   it retrieves the GUA and prefix information and binds them with the
   session initiated by UE.  PANA session ID can be used for the
   matching of the LLA/ULA and GUA to set up the binding relationship.

   With the approach shown in Figure 2, IP edge is able to get the
   specific address/prefix information of connected UE with embedded
   mechenism of PANA.  It is a light-weighted solution for IPv6 session
   information retrieval and binding in broadband access network.

   There is also another approach to solve this problem in the following
   figure, the address UE use in data communication may be allocated
   after authentification process finished, Figure 3 shows the message
   flow.

   UE use the LLA/ULA as source address to complete the authentification
   exchange with IP dege in step 3.  After this procedure, in step 4,
   HGW allocate the GUA address to UE,or the prefix within the range of
   the delegated /56 prefix in step 1 but is with 64-bit length.  When
   received the prefix with 64-bit length, UE use it to generate a GUA.
   In step 5 UE sends PNR(PANA-Notification-Request) with 'P' bit set to
   IP edge, 'P' bit was set to indicate doing the Ping operation between
   PANA peers.  GUA address generated in step 4 should be used as the
   source IP address.  When IP edge receives PNR, it retrieves the GUA
   and prefix information and binds them with the session initiated by
   UE.  PANA session ID can be used for the matching of the LLA/ULA and
   GUA to set up the binding relationship.

   With this approach shown in Figure 3, IP edge is able to get the
   specific address/prefix information of connected UE with mechenism of
   PANA.  It is another solution for IPv6 session information retrieval
   and binding in broadband access network.

3.  Security Considerations

   There is no extra security vulnarability introduced by this
   contribution.  AUTH AVP is used to integrity protect PANA messages
   when last PAN is sent and source IP address has been switched from
   LLA/ULA to GUA address.


4.  IANA Considerations

   There is no new IANA code required to be allocated.
