               Abstract 
                   
                  This memo describes how to carry real time text conversation session 
                  contents in RTP packets. Text conversation session contents are 
                  specified in ITU-T Recommendation T.140. 
                   
                  Two payload formats are described. One for transmitting text on a 
                  separate RTP session dedicated for the transmission of text, and one 
                  for transmitting audio and text data within one single RTP session.  
                   
                  This RTP payload description contains an optional possibility to 
                  include redundant text from already transmitted packets in order to

                                 RTP Payload for Text Conversation        March 2004 
                
               1. Introduction 
                   
                  This document defines two payload types for carrying text 
                  conversation session contents in RTP packets. Text conversation 
                  session contents are specified in ITU-T Recommendation T.140 [1]. 
                  Text conversation is used alone or in connection to other 
                  conversational facilities such as video and voice, to form multimedia 
                  conversation services. Text in multimedia conversation sessions is 
                  sent character-by-character as soon as it is available, or with a 
                  small delay for buffering. 
                   
                  The text is supposed to be entered by human users from a keyboard, 
                  handwriting recognition, voice recognition or any other input method.  
                  The rate of character entry is usually at a level of a few characters 
                  per second or less, though text may be transmitted at a much higher 
                  rate (e.g., automated systems or "copy and paste" operations may 
                  produce a lot of text very rapidly). In general, though, only one or 
                  a few new characters are expected to be transmitted with each packet. 
                   
                  T.140 specifies that text and other T.140 elements must be 
                  transmitted in ISO 10646-1[5] code with UTF-8 [6] transformation. 
                  That makes it easy to implement internationally useful applications 
                  and to handle the text in modern information technology environments.  
                  The payload of an RTP packet following this specification consists of 
                  text encoded according to T.140 without any additional framing.  A 
                  common case will be a single ISO 10646 character, UTF-8 encoded. 
                   
                  T.140 requires the transport channel to provide characters without 
                  duplication and in original order.  Text conversation users expect 
                  that text will be delivered with no or a low level of lost 
                  information. If lost information can be indicated, the willingness to 
                  accept loss is expected to be higher. 
                   
                  Therefore a mechanism based on RTP is specified here. It gives text 
                  arrival in correct order, without duplication, and with detection and 
                  indication of loss. It also includes an optional possibility to 
                  repeat data for redundancy to lower the risk of loss. Since packet 
                  overhead is usually much larger than the T.140 contents, the increase 
                  in bandwidth with the use of redundancy is minimal. 
                   
                  By using RTP for text transmission in a multimedia conversation 
                  application, uniform handling of text and other media can be achieved 
                  in, as examples, conferencing systems, firewalls, and network 
                  translation devices.  This, in turn, eases the design and increases 
                  the possibility for prompt and proper media delivery. 
                   
                  This document obsoletes RFC 2793 [11].  The text clarifies 
                  ambiguities in RFC 2793, improves on the specific implementation 
                  requirements learned through development experience, gives explicit

                  usage examples, and introduces a method of transporting text 
                  interleaved with voice within the same RTP session. 
                   
               2. Conventions used in this document 
                   
                  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
                  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
                  document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [4]. 
                   
               3. Usage of RTP  
                   
                  Two payload formats for real-time text transmission with RTP are 
                  described in this section, one for general text conversation use and 
                  another for use between gateways. 
                   
               3.1 Payload Format for Transmission of text/t140 Data 
                   
                  A text conversation RTP packet as specified by the text/t140 payload 
                  format consists of an RTP header as defined in RFC 3550 [2] followed 
                  immediately by a block of T.140 data, referred to as a "T140block" 
                  (see section 3.3).  There are no additional headers specific to this 
                  payload format.   
                   
                  The text/t140 format is primarily used when text is transmitted on a 
                  separate RTP session dedicated for the transmission of text and not 
                  shared with other media, such as audio, DTMF, etc.  IP textphone 
                  devices and IP multimedia conversation devices and network elements 
                  involved in communication with such devices most commonly use this 
                  format. 
                   
               3.2 Payload Format for Transmission of audio/t140 Data 
                   
                  A text conversation RTP packet as specified by the audio/t140 payload 
                  format consists of an RTP header as defined in RFC 3550 followed 
                  immediately by a 16-bit "t140block counter" (with the most 
                  significant bit transmitted first) followed by a "T140block" (see 
                  section 3.3).  There are no additional headers specific to this 
                  payload format. 
                   
                  The T140block counter MUST be initialized to zero the first time that 
                  a packet containing a T140block is transmitted and MUST be 
                  incremented by 1 each time that a new block is transmitted.  Once the 
                  counter reaches the value 0xFFFF, the counter is reset to 0 the next 
                  time the counter is incremented.  This T140block counter is used to 
                  detect lost blocks and to avoid duplication of blocks.  
                   
                  For the purposes of readability, the remainder of this document only 
                  refers to the T140block without making explicit reference to the 
                  T140block counter.  Readers should understand that when using the 



               Hellstrom              Expires - September 2004               [Page 4] 

                                 RTP Payload for Text Conversation        March 2004 
                
                  audio/t140 format, the T140block counter MUST always precede the 
                  actual T140block, including redundant data transmissions. 
                   
                  The primary purpose for the audio/t140 payload specification is to 
                  allow gateways that are interconnecting two PSTN networks to 
                  interleave, through a single RTP session, audio and text data 
                  received on the PSTN circuit.  This is comparable to the way in which 
                  DTMF is extracted and transmitted within an RTP session [10]. Note 
                  that the audio/t140 format does not allow simultaneous audio and text 
                  transmission, because the expectation is that at each moment, only 
                  one payload type is selected for play-out.   
                   
               3.3 The "T140block" 
                   
                  The T140block contains one or more T.140 code elements as specified 
                  in [1].  Most T.140 code elements are single ISO 10646 [5] 
                  characters, but some are multiple character sequences.  Each 
                  character is UTF-8 encoded [6] into one or more octets. Each block 
                  MUST contain an integral number of UTF-8 encoded characters 
                  regardless of the number of octets per character. Any composite 
                  character sequence (CCS) SHOULD be placed within one block. 
                   
               3.4 Use of Redundancy 
                   
                  The T140blocks MAY be transmitted redundantly according to the 
                  payload format defined in RFC 2198 [3].  In that case, the RTP header 
                  is followed by one or more redundant data block headers, the same 
                  number of redundant data fields carrying T140blocks from previous 
                  packets, and finally the new (primary) T140block for this packet. 
                   
               3.5 Use of Forward Error Correction 
                   
                  When transmitting text via RTP it is possible to use other robustness 
                  mechanisms, including Forward Error Correction (FEC) as described in 
                  RFC 2733 [8].  In such applications, the same mechanisms MAY be 
                  employed with text as with other media formats. 
                   
               3.6 Synchronization of Text with Other Media 
                   
                  Usually, each medium in a session utilizes a separate RTP stream. As 
                  such, if synchronization of the text and other media packets is 
                  important, the streams MUST be associated when the sessions are 
                  established and the streams MUST share the same reference clock 
                  (refer to the description of the timestamp field as it relates to 
                  synchronization in section 5.1 of RFC 3550).  Association of RTP 
                  streams is dependent on the particular session application and is 
                  outside the scope of this document. 
                   
                  When audio/t140 is used, it is generally transmitted as interleaved 
                  packets between voice packets or other kinds of audio packets.  One

                  should observe the RTP timestamps of the voice, text, or other audio 
                  packets in order to reproduce the stream correctly when playing out 
                  the audio.  Note, also, that incoming text from a PSTN circuit might 
                  be at a higher bit-rate than can be played out on an egress PSTN 
                  circuit.  As such, it is possible that, on the egress side, a gateway 
                  may not complete the play out of the text packets before it is time 
                  to play the next voice packet.  Given that this application is 
                  primarily for the benefit of deaf users utilizing PSTN textphone 
                  devices, it is strongly RECOMMENDED that all received text packets be 
                  properly reproduced on the egress gateway before considering any 
                  subsequent other audio packets.  If necessary, voice and other audio 
                  packets should be discarded in order to properly reproduce the text 
                  signals on the PSTN circuit, even if the text packets arrive late. 
                  The users commonly use turn-taking indicators in the text stream, so 
                  it can be expected that as long as text is transmitted, it is valid 
                  text and should be given priority over voice. 
                   
               3.7 RTP packet header 
                   
                  Each RTP packet starts with a fixed RTP header. The following fields 
                  of the RTP fixed header are specified for T.140 text streams: 
                   
                  Payload Type (PT): The assignment of an RTP payload type is specific 
                    to the RTP profile under which this payload format is used.  For 
                    profiles that use dynamic payload type number assignment, this 
                    payload format can be identified by the MIME types "text/T140" and 
                    "audio/T140" (see section 8).  If redundancy is used per RFC 2198, 
                    another payload type number needs to be provided for the redundancy 
                    format. MIME types for identifying RFC 2198 are available in RFC 
                    3555 and RFC YYYY. 
                   
                  Sequence number: The definition of sequence numbers is available in 
                    RFC 3550 [2]. When transmitting text using the payload format for 
                    text/t140, it is used for detection of packet loss and packets out 
                    of order, and can be used in the process of retrieval of redundant 
                    text, reordering of text and marking missing text.  Character loss 
                    is detected through the T140block counter when using the audio/t140 
                    payload format.) 
                   
                  Timestamp: The RTP Timestamp encodes the approximate instance of 
                    entry of the primary text in the packet. A clock frequency of 1000 
                    Hz MUST be used for text/t140.  For audio/T140, the clock frequency 
                    MAY be set to any value, and SHOULD be set to the same value as for 
                    any audio packets in the same RTP stream in order to avoid RTP 
                    timestamp rate switching. The value SHOULD be set by out of band 
                    mechanisms.  Sequential packets MUST NOT use the same timestamp. 
                    Since packets do not represent any constant duration, the timestamp 
                    cannot be used to directly infer packet loss.

                  M-bit: The M-bit has no defined meaning for t140 text streams and 
                    MUST be set to 0. 
                   
               3.8 Structure of redundant data. 
                   
                  When redundant transmission of the data according to RFC 2198 is 
                  desired, the RTP header is followed by one or more redundant data 
                  block headers, one for each redundant data block to be included.  
                  Each of these headers provides the timestamp offset and length of the 
                  corresponding data block plus a payload type number indicating this 
                  payload format ("T140").  Redundant data older than 16383 divided by 
                  the clock frequency MUST NOT be transmitted. 
                   
               3.9 T.140 Text Structure 
                   
                  T.140 text is UTF-8 coded as specified in T.140 with no extra 
                  framing. When using the format with redundant data, the transmitter 
                  MAY select a number of T140block generations to retransmit in each 
                  packet. A higher number introduces better protection against loss of 
                  text but marginally increases the data rate. 
                   
                  The timestamp is not sufficient to identify a packet in the presence 
                  of loss unless extra information is provided. Since sequence numbers 
                  are not provided in the redundant header, some additional rules must 
                  be followed to allow the redundant data corresponding to missing 
                  primary data to be merged properly into the stream of primary data 
                  T140blocks when using the text/t140 payload format. They are: 
                   
                    - Each redundant data block MUST contain the same data as a 
                       T140block previously transmitted as primary data, and be 
                       identified with a timestamp offset equating to the original 
                       timestamp for that T140block. 
                    - The redundant data MUST be placed in age order with most recent 
                       redundant T140block last in the redundancy area. 
                    - All T140blocks from the oldest desired generation up through the 
                       generation immediately preceding the new (primary) T140block 
                       MUST be included. 
                   
                  For the text/t140 payload format, these rules allow the sequence 
                  numbers for the redundant T140blocks to be inferred by counting 
                  backwards from the sequence number in the RTP header.  The result 
                  will be that all the text in the payload will be contiguous and in 
                  order. 
                   
               4. Recommended Procedure 
                
                  This section contains RECOMMENDED procedures for usage of the payload 
                  format.  Based on the information in the received packets, the 
                  receiver can: 
                   


               Hellstrom              Expires - September 2004               [Page 7] 

                                 RTP Payload for Text Conversation        March 2004 
                
                    - reorder text received out of order. 
                    - mark where text is missing because of packet loss. 
                    - compensate for lost packets by using redundant data. 
                   
               4.1 Recommended Basic Procedure 
                   
                  Packets are transmitted only when there is valid T.140 data to 
                  transmit. The sequence number is used for sequencing of T.140 data. 
                   
                  T.140 specifies that T.140 data MAY be buffered before transmission 
                  with a maximum buffering time of 500 ms. In order to keep the maximum 
                  bit rate usage for text at a reasonable level, it is RECOMMENDED to 
                  buffer T.140 data for transmission in 300 ms intervals. This time is 
                  selected so that text users will still perceive a real time text 
                  flow. 
                   
                  On reception of text/t140 data, the RTP sequence number is compared 
                  with the sequence number of the last received packet.  On receipt of 
                  audio/t140 data, the T140block counter is compared with the T140block 
                  counter of the last received packet.  If they are consecutive, the 
                  (only or primary) T140block is retrieved from the packet. 
                   
               4.2 Detection of Lost Text Packets 
                   
                  Packet loss for text/t140 packets MAY be detected by observing gaps 
                  in the sequence numbers of RTP packets received by the receiver.  
                  With audio/t140, however, packets following a text packet might be 
                  audio packets of a format other than audio/text, so the same rule 
                  does not apply.  Rather, receivers detect the loss of an audio/t140 
                  packet by observing the value of the T140block counter in a 
                  subsequent audio/t140 packet. 
                   
                  With both text/t140 and audio/t140, the loss of the last packet of a 
                  sequence of packets cannot be detected until the next text packet is 
                  transmitted. 
                   
               4.3 Recommended Procedure for Compensation for Lost Packets 
                   
                  For reduction of data loss in case of packet loss, redundant data MAY 
                  be included in the packets following to the procedures in RFC 2198.  
                  If network conditions are not known, it is RECOMMENDED to use three 
                  redundant T140blocks in each packet. If there is a gap in the RTP 
                  sequence numbers for text/t140, and redundant T140blocks are 
                  available in a subsequent packet, the sequence numbers for the 
                  redundant T140blocks should be inferred by counting backwards from 
                  the sequence number in the RTP header for that packet.  Note that 
                  redundant audio/t140 data contains the t140block counters preceding 
                  the T140block, which simplifies the ordering by the receiver.  If 
                  there are redundant T140blocks with sequence numbers or t140block 



               Hellstrom              Expires - September 2004               [Page 8] 

                                 RTP Payload for Text Conversation        March 2004 
                
                  counters matching those that are missing, the redundant T140blocks 
                  may be substituted for the missing T140blocks. 
                   
                  As an alternative (or in addition) to redundancy, Forward Error 
                  Correction mechanisms MAY be used when transmitting text, as per RFC 
                  2733 [8] or any other mechanism with the purpose of increasing the 
                  reliability of text transmission. 
                   
                  There are also other mechanisms for increasing robustness of 
                  transmission that MAY be applied. 
                   
                  Missing data SHOULD be marked by insertion of a missing text marker 
                  in the received stream for each missing T140block, as specified in 
                  ITU-T T.140 Addendum 1 [1]. 
                   
               4.4 Recommended Procedure for Compensation for Packets Out of Order 
                   
                  For protection against packets arriving out of order, the following 
                  procedure MAY be implemented in the receiver.  If analysis of a 
                  received packet reveals a gap in the sequence and no redundant data 
                  is available to fill that gap, the received packet SHOULD be kept in 
                  a buffer to allow time for the missing packet(s) to arrive.  It is 
                  RECOMMENDED that the waiting time be limited to 0.5 seconds.  
                   
                  If a packet with a T140block belonging to the gap arrives before the 
                  waiting time expires, this T140block is inserted into the gap and 
                  then consecutive T140blocks from the leading edge of the gap may be 
                  consumed.  Any T140block which does not arrive before the time limit 
                  expires should be treated as lost. 
                   
               4.5 Transmission During "Silent Periods" when Redundancy is Used 
                   
                  When using the redundancy transmission scheme, and there is redundant 
                  data, but no new T.140 data to transmit after the transmit buffering 
                  interval described in section 4.1 has passed, a packet MUST be 
                  transmitted containing a zero-length primary T140block and the 
                  properly positioned redundant data.  When using the audio/t140 
                  payload format with an empty T140block, the T140block counter MUST 
                  also be absent (as there is no actual T140block).  
                   
                  When using the text/t140 payload format, any zero-length T140blocks 
                  that are sent as primary data MUST be included as redundant 
                  T140blocks on subsequent packets just as normal text T140blocks would 
                  be so that sequence number inference for the redundant T140blocks 
                  will be correct, as explained in section 3.9. 
                   
                  When using the audio/t140 payload format, zero-length T140blocks sent 
                  as primary data MUST NOT be included as redundant T140blocks, as it 
                  would simply be a waste of bandwidth to send them.

                  Redundancy for the last T140block MUST NOT be implemented by 
                  repeatedly transmitting the same packet (with the same sequence 
                  number) because this will cause the packet loss count, as reported in 
                  RTCP, to decrement. 
                   
               5. SDP Attribute for Character Transmission Rate 
                   
                  In some cases, it is necessary to limit the rate at which characters 
                  are transmitted.  While the "b=" SDP attribute could be used to limit 
                  the rate of the RTP session, it may be that only the text stream in 
                  an interleaved audio/text session needs special handling.  For 
                  example, when a PSTN gateway is interworking between an IP device 
                  (not necessarily a textphone) and a PSTN textphone, it may be 
                  necessary to limit the character rate from the IP device in order to 
                  avoid throwing away characters at the PSTN gateway.  At the same 
                  time, no explicit bit rate restriction is necessarily applied to the 
                  audio stream. Despite the fact that character rate may be limited in 
                  a session, the instantaneous reception rate might be higher due to 
                  jitter. 
                   
                  To control the character transmission rate, the MIME parameter "cps=" 
                  in the "fmtp" attribute [7] is defined (see section 8 ). It is used 
                  in SDP with the following syntax: 
                   
                      a=fmtp:<format> cps=<integer> 
                   
                  The <format> field is populated with the payload type that is used 
                  for text.  The <integer> field contains an integer representing the

                  Devices in receipt of this parameter MUST adhere to the request by 
                  transmitting characters at a rate at or below the specified <integer> 
                  value. Note that this parameter was not defined in RFC 2793 [11]. 
                  Therefore implementations of the text/t140 format may be in use that 
                  do not recognize and act according to this parameter. Receivers of 
                  text/t140 SHALL therefore be designed so that they can handle 
                  temporary reception of characters at a higher rate than this 
                  parameter specifies, so that no malfunction is experienced for text 
                  conversation with human input.

                     empty block is present in the redundant transmissions of the 
                     text/t140 payload format.  This example shows 2 levels of 
                     redundancy and one primary data block.  The value of the "R2 
                     block length" would be set to zero in order to 
                     represent the empty T140block.

                     audio/t140 payload format, the redundant block of T.140 data is 
                     immediately preceded with a T140block counter.

                     As a follow-on to the previous example, the example below shows 
                     the next RTP packet in the sequence which does contain a new real 
                     T140block when using the audio/t140 payload format.  This  
                     example has 2 levels of redundancy and one primary data block. 
                     Since the previous primary block was empty, no redundant data 
                     is included for that block.  This is because when using the 
                     audio/t140 payload format, any previously transmitted "empty" 
                     T140blocks are NOT included as redundant data in subsequent 
                     packets.

               6.3 SDP Examples 
                   
                  Below is an example of SDP describing RTP text transport on port 
                  11000: 
                   
                      m=text 11000 RTP/AVP 98 
                      a=rtpmap:98 t140/1000 
                   
                  Below is an example of SDP similar to the above example, but also 
                  utilizing RFC 2198 to provide redundancy for the text packets: 
                   
                      m=text 11000 RTP/AVP 98 100 
                      a=rtpmap:98 t140/1000 
                      a=rtpmap:100 red/1000 
                      a=fmtp:100 98/98 
                   
                  Below is an example of SDP describing RTP text interleaved with G.711 
                  audio packets within the same RTP session from port 7200 and at a 
                  maximum text rate of 6 characters per second: 
                   
                      m=audio 7200 RTP/AVP 0 98 
                      a=rtpmap:98 t140/8000 
                      a=fmtp:98 cps=6

                  Below is an example using RFC 2198 to provide redundancy to just the 
                  text packets in an RTP session with interleaving text and G.711 at a 
                  text rate no faster than 6 characters per second: 
                   
                      m=audio 7200 RTP/AVP 0 98 100 
                      a=rtpmap:98 t140/8000 
                      a=fmtp:98 cps=6 
                      a=rtpmap:100 red/8000 
                      a=fmtp:100 98/98 
                   
                  Note - While these examples utilize the RTP/AVP profile, it is not 
                  intended to limit the scope of this memo to use with only that 
                  profile.  Rather, any appropriate profile may be used in conjunction 
                  with this memo. 
                   
               7. Security Considerations 
                   
                  All of the security considerations from section 14 of RFC 3550 apply. 
                   
               7.1 Confidentiality 
                   
                  Since the intention of the described payload format is to carry text 
                  in a text conversation, security measures in the form of encryption 
                  are of importance. The amount of data in a text conversation session 
                  is low and therefore any encryption method MAY be selected and 
                  applied to T.140 session contents or to the whole RTP packets. SRTP 
                  [9] provides a suitable method for ensuring confidentiality.  
                   
               7.2 Integrity 
                   
                  It may be desirable to protect the text contents of an RTP stream 
                  against manipulation.  SRTP [9] provides methods for providing 
                  integrity that MAY be applied.  
                   
               7.3 Source authentication 
                   
                  Measures to make sure that the source of text is the intended one can 
                  be accomplished by a combination of methods. 
                   
                  Text streams are usually used in a multimedia control environment. 
                  Security measures for authentication are available and SHOULD be 
                  applied in the registration and session establishment procedures, so 
                  that the identity of the sender of the text stream is reliably 
                  associated with the person or device setting up the session. Once 
                  established, SRTP [9] mechanisms MAY be applied to ascertain that the 
                  source is maintained the same during the session.      
                   
               8. IANA considerations

                                 RTP Payload for Text Conversation        March 2004 
                
                  This document defines an RTP payload named "t140" and two associated 
                  MIME types, "text/t140" and "audio/t140", to be registered by IANA. 
                   
               8.1 Registration of MIME Media Type text/t140

                     Required parameters: 
                       rate: The RTP timestamp clock rate, which is equal to the 
                       sampling rate.  The only valid value is 1000. 
                   
                     Optional parameters: 
                       cps: The maximum number of characters that may be received 
                       per second. 
                   
                     Encoding considerations: T.140 text can be transmitted with RTP as 
                       specified in RFC XXXX. 
                   
                     Security considerations: See section 7 of RFC XXXX. 
                   
                     Interoperability considerations: This format is the same as 
                     specified in RFC2793. For RFC2793 the "cps=" parameter was not 
                     defined. Therefore there may be implementations that do not 
                     consider this parameter. Receivers need to take that into account.

                     Applications which use this media type: 
                       Text communication terminals and text conferencing tools. 
                   
                     Additional information: This type is only defined for transfer via 
                     RTP.

                     Required parameters: 
                       rate: The RTP timestamp clock rate, which is equal to the 
                       sampling rate. This parameter SHOULD have the same value as for 
                       any audio codec packets interleaved in the same RTP stream.  
                   
                     Optional parameters: 
                       cps: The maximum number of characters that may be received

                       Text communication systems and text conferencing tools that 
                       transmit text associated with audio and within the same RTP 
                       session as the audio, such as PSTN gateways that transmit 
                       audio and text signals between two PSTN textphone users 
                       over an IP network. 
                   
                     Additional information:  This type is only defined for transfer 
                       via RTP.

                  The IETF takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any 
                  intellectual property or other rights that might be claimed to 
                  pertain to the implementation or use of the technology described in 
                  this document or the extent to which any license under such rights 
                  might or might not be available; neither does it represent that it 
                  has made any effort to identify any such rights.  Information on the 
                  IETF's procedures with respect to rights in standards-track and 
                  standards-related documentation can be found in BCP-11.  Copies of 
                  claims of rights made available for publication and any assurances of 
                  licenses to be made available, or the result of an attempt made to 
                  obtain a general license or permission for the use of such 
                  proprietary rights by implementors or users of this specification can 
                  be obtained from the IETF Secretariat. 
                   
                  The IETF invites any interested party to bring to its attention any 
                  copyrights, patents or patent applications, or other proprietary 
                  rights which may cover technology that may be required to practice 
                  this standard.  Please address the information to the IETF Executive 
                  Director.
