                     Multicast Tree Setup via PCEP
                       draft-li-pce-multicast-00

Abstract

   Multicast forwarding requires per-tree state on certain nodes.  Even
   with BIER, per-tree state is needed on ingress/egress BIER routers
   (though not needed on transit BIER routers).  This documents
   specifies PCEP protocol to collect tree information (e.g. root, leaf,
   constraints) to allow a PCE to calculate a tree, and the procedures
   to set up per-tree forwarding state on relevant nodes for various
   multicast trees and various replication technologies.

1.  Introduction

   Currently, multicast management information is mainly signaled by PIM
   [RFC2362], mLDP [RFC6388] or BGP [RFC6514].  The trees/tunnels are
   set up using the "receiver-initiated join" technique of PIM/mLDP, hop
   by hop from downstream routers towards the root.  The BGP messages
   are either sent hop by hop between downstream routers and their
   upstream neighbors, or can be reflected by Route Reflectors (RRs).
   The signaling is the interaction between routers and cannot be
   managed in a unified manner.

   As an alternative to each hop independently determining its upstream
   router and signaling upstream towards the root (following PIM/mLDP
   model), the entire tree can be calculated by a centralized
   controller, and the signaling can be entirely done from the
   controller.

   [RFC4655] defines a stateful PCE to be one in which the PCE maintains
   "strict synchronization between the PCE and not only the network
   states (in term of topology and resource information), but also the
   set of computed paths and reserved resources in use in the network."
   [RFC8231] specifies a set of extensions to PCEP to support state
   synchronization between PCCs and PCEs.

   The controller can serve as a PCE to centrally manage multicast trees
   and establish states on all tree nodes serving as PCC.  This document
   defines PCEP objects and TLVs to accomplish the multicast source
   registration/revocation, receiver discovery, multicast tree state
   update etc. functions.

Internet-Draft        Multicast Tree Setup via PCEP           March 2022


2.  Overview

2.1.  Different Multicast Trees

   This section discusses various multicast trees like IP, mLDP, SR-P2MP
   - each with its own tree identification.

2.1.1.  IP Multicast

   As stated in [RFC1112], an IP multicast packet's destination address
   is a Multicast Group Address and it follows either a source specific
   tree rooted at the First Hop Router (FHR) or a shared tree rooted at
   a Rendezvous Point (RP) [RFC7761].  Each tree is identified by a
   (source address, group address) pair, where the source address MAY be
   a wildcard in case of the shared tree.  This identification, which is
   often referred to as (s, g) or (*, g), is used in both forwarding
   plane as well as in control plane that sets up the tree, e.g., using
   Protocol Independ Multicast (PIM) [RFC7761] [RFC5015].

   Each node on the tree needs to have corresponding forwarding plane
   state used to forward corresponding traffic and control plane state
   that is used to set up a tree.  Depending on the number of (s, g)
   and/or (*, g) trees that a routing domain need to support, serious
   scaling/convergence problems MAY result.

2.1.2.  mLDP/RSVP-TE P2MP Tunnels

   Quite often, some different multicast trees are used for similar
   purposes and the tree structure are identical or very similar.  For
   example, in an IPTV application, many channels MAY need to be sent
   from the same headend router to the same set of edge routers close to
   receivers.

   In that case, a set of IP multicast trees can be transported over a
   fewer set of MPLS P2MP tunnels - either mLDP [RFC6388] or RSVP-TE
   P2MP [RFC4875] tunnels - across an MPLS domain.  Inside the MPLS
   domain, there is no IP multicast tree state but only fewer state for
   the P2MP tunnels.  Outside the MPLS domain, those IP multicast trees
   still have their per-tree state on each tree node.

   An mLDP tree is identified by an mLDP FEC in the control plane.  In
   the context of PCEP signaling, part of or an entire mLDP tunnel can
   be set up using PCEP from a PCE instead of using hop-by-hop mLDP
   signaling.  In this case the only relevance to mLDP is that mLDP FEC
   is used to identify the tunnel.

Internet-Draft        Multicast Tree Setup via PCEP           March 2022


   A RSVP-TE P2MP tree is identified by a RSVP Session object in the
   control plane.  While in theory it can also be set up via PCEP
   signaling from a PCE, it is outside the scope of this document.

   In the forwarding plane, there is no difference between an mLDP
   tunnel and a RSVP-TE P2MP tunnel.  A tree is identified by a label -
   incoming labeled traffic is replicated to a bunch of downstream nodes
   with a label that identifies the tree to the downstream nodes.

2.1.3.  SR-P2MP Tunnels

   Segment Routing (SR) [RFC8402] has two principles:

   1.  No per-flow/tunnel state inside an SR domain

   2.  Optional but perferred use of controllers

   When it comes to multicast, the only technologies that sticks to
   principle #1 is BIER [RFC8279], which does not use per-tree state for
   forwarding.

   SR-P2MP [I-D.ietf-pim-sr-p2mp-policy]
   [I-D.ietf-spring-sr-replication-segment] sticks to principle #2 only,
   in that PCEs are used to calculate a multicast tree subject to
   constraints and then direct signaling from PCEs are used to set up
   the tree instead of using mLDP/RSVP signaling, but per-tree state is
   still used.

   In the control plane, an SR-P2MP is identified by a (root-id, tree-
   id) tuple.  In an SR-MPLS forwarding plane, an SR-P2MP tunnel is not
   different from mLDP/RSVP-TE P2MP tunnel at all, though the tree-
   identifying label is called a tree sid.

   In an SRv6 forwarding plane, the tree sid is embedded as part of an
   IPv6 address.

2.2.  Different Replication Technologies

   For any kind of multicast trees mentioned above, on a particular tree
   node A, an incoming packet needs to replicated to a set of downstream
   nodes B/C/D/E.  Note that the upstream and downstream nodes MAY be
   directly connected or they can be reached via a set of P2P/MP2P
   tunnels, P2MP tunnels, or via BIER.  In the latter case, intermediate
   nodes do not maintain the per-tree state but they do need to maintain
   state for the transporting tunnels or BIER.

   Now on node A/B/C/D/E, per-tree replication state needs to be set up.
   In particular on A, depending on the method used to replicate to



Li, et al.              Expires September 8, 2022               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft        Multicast Tree Setup via PCEP           March 2022


   B/C/D/E, (a combination of) the following replication branches are
   needed:

   o  A set of outgoing interfaces for native IP forwarding to directly
      connected nodes from the B/C/D/E set in case of IP multicast tree,
      and/or,

   o  A set of P2P/MP2P/P2MP tunnels to reach indirectly connected nodes
      from the B/C/D/E set, and/or,

   o  A BIER bitstring and relevant BIER information to reach some nodes
      from the B/C/D/E set

   In the latter two cases, the replication branches also need relevant
   information to identify to B/C/D/E which tree a packet is for (e.g.,
   a label for an mLDP or SR-P2MP tree).

2.3.  Tree Information Discovery

   When a PCE calculates a multicast tree, it needs to collect the tree
   information like root, leaves and calculation constraints.  This MAY
   be provided to the PCE via a southbound (wrt the PCE) interface from
   an orchestrator or via northbound PCEP signaling from some PCC nodes
   (e.g. the root and leaf nodes of the tree).  The PCE MAY also
   participate overlay signaling protocols to collect the information
   (e.g., [I-D.zzhang-mvpn-evpn-controller]).

   This document only covers the northbound PCEP signaling.  The two
   other methods mentioned above are out of scope of this document.

   Whether it is an IP Multicast or mLDP/SR-P2MP Tree, the root, leaves
   and calculation constraints are encoded the same way but associated
   with different tree identifications in the PCEP signaling.
   Specifically, the root and leaves are encoded as IP addresses.

   The leaf information can be encoded as a full set of leaves or as
   addition/removal delta.

2.3.1.  Root node Discovery

   When a multicast source accesses to a First Hop Router (FHR), the FHR
   originates a PCRpt message carrying the Multicast Source Registration
   (MSR) object defined in Section 3.3, which provides FHR information.
   FHR, as PCC, delegate the controller as PCE to calculate multicast
   tree.  In the sent PCRpt message, the D bit of LSP Object is set to
   1.

Internet-Draft        Multicast Tree Setup via PCEP           March 2022


2.3.2.  Leaf node Discovery

   For IP multicast, Last Hop Router (LHR) MAY convert the multicast
   source and group address carried in the IGMP Join/Leave messages sent
   by local hosts and VPN information corresponding to local hosts into
   PCRpt messages and report these information to the controller.
   Similar to IGMP messages, PIM messages from other domains can also be
   used as receiver information and be converted into PCRpt messages to
   be reported to the controller.

   For mLDP and SR-P2MP multicast, The corresponding tree identifiers
   can also be carried in PCRpt messages and reported to the controller.

   When the first receiver accesses a Last Hop Router (LHR) to join a
   multicast tree, or when the last receiver leaves the LHR, the LHR
   originates a PCRpt message carrying the Multicast Receiver
   Information (MRI) object defined in Section 3.4, which provides LHR
   information.

   If the receivers locate in different VPN domains, the VPN information
   associated with the multicast source and multicast destination should
   also be reported by the LHR and FHR.  The VPN information reported by
   LHRs SHOULD be consistent.

2.4.  Multicast Tree

   The multicast trees are established with the FHRs of the multicast
   source as the root of the multicast trees.  According to different
   multicast technologies, the types of multicast trees include mLDP
   tree, SR-P2MP tree and BIER tree.  Different multicast trees
   correspond to different processing.  This section describes the state
   update of different multicast operations.

   No matter which forwarding technology is used, there is a case that
   local multicast receivers directly access to FHRs.  In this case,
   FHRs need to forward multicast data for local receivers in the way of
   native IP without other control information.

2.4.1.  mLDP Tree

   For a multicast tree, each node needs a tree label to identify a
   multicast tree.  There are three options for tree label assignment:

   o  From each router's SRLB that the controller learns

   o  From the common SRGB that the controller learns

   o  From the controller's local label space

   The detailed instruction is as per
   [I-D.ietf-bess-bgp-multicast-controller].  Section 3.5.1 defines a
   new TLV to extend the CCI Object-Type support the tree label.

   The operations for initiating multicast tree LSPs and
   downloadinglabels are consistent with [I-D.ietf-pce-sr-p2mp-policy].

2.4.2.  SR-P2MP Tree

   The processing of PCE-based SR P2MP policy delivery and P2MP path
   establishment has been defined in [I-D.ietf-pce-sr-p2mp-policy].  For
   the calculated multicast tree, SR P2MP multicast tree update can
   refer to that document.

2.4.3.  BIER Tree

   Different from other forwarding technologies, BIER does not need the
   transit nodes to maintain the multicast state, and only needs to
   forward and encapsulate the packets according to the BitString and
   BIFT.  BIFT information can be learned by IGP.  For each node of a
   sub-domain, the BIFT can be configured locally or allocated by BGP
   controller or PCE.  Allocation by PCE is as per
   [I-D.chen-pce-pcep-extension-pce-controller-bier].

   After receiving the BFR information reported from LHRs, the
   controller combine BFR information of LHRs into a BitString to guide
   multicast data forwarding.

   The controller (PCE) sends the BitString to the FHR via PCInitiate or
   PCUpd message carrying Tree Forwarding State Synchronization (TFSS)
   object defined in Section 3.6 to inform the FHR to forward multicast
   data for a specific multicast tree according to the BitString, and
   the tree identifier is (*, g) or (s, g) tuple.

2.5.  Multicast Statistics

   Multicast statistics are helpful for multicast service analysis and
   business development.  This section describes how to collect
   statistics about multicast users.

   For each LHR, the statistics consist of two parts, one is the number
   of local users in the its managed domain, and the other is the number
   of other managed domains.  The sum of these two parts is the number
   of multicast data that the one LHR needs to duplicate.

   LHRs send this information to the controller via PCRpt message
   carrying Multicast Receiver Statistics (MRS) object.  LHRs need
   report this information to the controller periodically.  Once the

Internet-Draft        Multicast Tree Setup via PCEP           March 2022


   statistics information of a LHR change, the LHR also needs reports to
   the controller.

   Controller collects the statistics reported by LHRs and MAY
   periodically informs the FHR of the statistics via PCRpt messages
   carrying MRS object so that the FHR can feed the statistics back to
   the multicast source.

3.  PCEP Object Formats

3.1.  OPEN Object

3.1.1.  STATEFUL-PCE-CAPABILITY TLV

   During the PCEP initialization phase, PCEP speakers advertise
   stateful capability via the STATEFUL-PCE-CAPABILITY TLV in the OPEN
   object.  Various flags are defined for the STATEFUL-PCE-CAPABILITY
   TLV defined in [RFC8231] and updated in [RFC8232] and [RFC8281].

   A new flag is added in this document, whose code point is TBD1:

   MULTICAST-STATE-CAPABILITY bit, if this bit is set to 1 by a PCEP
   speaker, it indicates that the PCEP speaker supports the capability
   of these new extensions as specified in this document.

   To support the multicast tree state management capabilities described
   in this document, both PCE and PCC need to set MULTICAST-STATE-
   CAPABILITY bit.  If a PCEP speaker receivers PECP message with the
   newly defined object, but without the MULTICAST-STATE-CAPABILITY bit
   set in STATEFUL-PCE-CAPABILITY TLV in the OPEN object, it MUST:

   o  Send a PCErr message with Error-Type=10(Reception of an invalid
      object) and Error-Value TBD2(MULTICAST-STATE-CAPABILITY bit is not
      set).

   o  Terminate the PCEP session.

3.1.2.  PCECC Capability sub-TLV

   The PCECC-CAPABILITY sub-TLV is an optional TLV for use in the OPEN
   Object for PCECC capability advertisement in PATH-SETUP-TYPE-
   CAPABILITY TLV as specified in [RFC9050].

   [I-D.dhody-pce-pcep-extension-pce-controller-p2mp] adds a new flag (M
   Bit) in the PCECC-CAPABILITY sub-TLV to indicate the support for P2MP

                Figure 12: Workflow of Multicast Tree Discovery

   In the previous multicast tree discovery process, ingress has
   delegated the PCE to calculate the multicast path.  Therefore, during
   the establishment of the multicast tree, PCE informs the ingress to
   forward multicast data for (S,G)/(*,G) via PCInitiate message
   carrying TFSS object according to the delegation.  The PLSP-ID is the
   value specified by the ingress.

   Ingress then updates the tree state and responds to the PCE.  At this
   point, the BIER tree is formally established and the ingress starts
   forwarding for the multicast according to the BitString specified by
   PCE.

   If the topology of the BIER tree changes, the corresponding egresses
   will send PCRpt messages carring MRI object to PCE to inform PCE of
   their changes.

   The PCE updates the BitStrig based on changes of the egresses and
   informs the ingress to update.  State update process is similar to
   state setup process, except for the type of message sent by the PCE.
