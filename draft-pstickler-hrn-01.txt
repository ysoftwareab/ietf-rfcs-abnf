Abstract

   This document describes the 'hrn:' Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
   scheme for hierarchical resource names.

   The 'hrn:' URI scheme belongs to the class of Hierarchical URI
   Schemes as defined in RFC 2396 "Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI):
   Generic Syntax".

   This URI scheme is also a type of URN, as defined by RFC 2396, but is
   not a namespace of the 'urn:' URI scheme.

Internet-Draft             The hrn: URI Scheme                March 2002


1. Overview

   The 'hrn:' URI scheme is intended for defining resource names (URNs)
   which may be hierarchically organized, such that resources may be
   logically related by their URI structure.

   The 'hrn:' URI scheme belongs to the class of Hierarchical URI
   Schemes as defined in RFC 2396 "Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI):
   Generic Syntax" [4] and as such provides for parsing into distinct
   subcomponents, each constituting a hierarchically distinct level.
   The hierarchical characteristics of 'hrn:' URIs are discussed later
   in this document.

   This URI scheme is also a type of URN, as defined by RFC 2396, but is
   not a namespace of the 'urn:' URI scheme [5], because the 'urn:'
   scheme does not provide for hierarchical characteristics which are
   central to the semantics of this URI scheme.

   Examples:

      hrn://abc.com/288918293/3/en/global/docbook
      hrn://abc.com/288918293/3/sp/europe/xhtml
      hrn://-/f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6
      hrn://-/f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6/xml
      hrn://-/f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6/pdf
      hrn://-/f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6/html
      hrn://john.doe@widgets.org/thesis

   These examples are provided for illustrative purposes only and do not
   necessarily constitute actual URIs.  See the BNF definition below for
   an explicit definition of 'hrn:' URI syntax.

2. BNF for the 'hrn:' URI Scheme

   This is a BNF-like description of the 'hrn:' Uniform Resource
   Identifier syntax, using the conventions of RFC 822[1], except that
   "|" is used to designate alternatives, and brackets [] are used
   around optional or repeated elements.  Briefly, literals are quoted
   with "", optional elements are enclosed in [brackets], and elements
   may be preceded with <n>* to designate n or more repetitions of the
   following element; n defaults to 0.

   This BNF description adopts sub-definitions defined in RFC 1738
   "Uniform Resource Locators (URL)" [2].  The definition of UUID is
   adapted from the Internet Draft draft-kindel-uuid-uri-00 [3] defining
   the UUID string representation conforming to ISO-11578 [7] and
   adopted by RFC 2518 "HTTP Extensions for Distributed Authoring --
   WEBDAV" [6].

   hrn-URI        = "hrn://" authority [ "/" name-path ]
   hrn-URI        = "hrn://-/" UUID [ "/" name-path ]

   authority      = [ user "@" ] host
   name-path      = name *( "/" name )
   name           = 1*uchar

   UUID           = 8hex "-" 4hex "-" 4hex "-" 4hex "-" 12hex
   hex            = digit | "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f"

   host           = <as defined by RFC 1738>
   user           = <as defined by RFC 1738>
   digit          = <as defined by RFC 1738>
   uchar          = <as defined by RFC 1738>



3. Hierarchical Characteristics of 'hrn:' URIs

   The 'hrn:' URI scheme belongs to the class of Hierarchical URI
   Schemes as defined in RFC 2396 "Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI):
   Generic Syntax" [4] and as such provides for parsing into distinct
   subcomponents, each constituting a hierarchically distinct level.

   Each 'hrn:' URI containing one or more levels beyond the URI
   authority implies an 'hrn:' URI for each level up to and including
   the authority level, though implied 'hrn:' URIs need not have any
   properties associated with them nor be meaningful to any particular
   system.

   Note that it is not required that an 'hrn:' URI encoded name have any
   levels beyond the first name level.  Thus, the 'hrn:' URI scheme is
   suitable both for simple, "flat" names as well as for hierarchical
   names.

   E.g.  the following 'hrn:' URI

      hrn://abc.com/288918293/3/en/global/docbook













Stickler                Expires September 5, 2002               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft             The hrn: URI Scheme                March 2002


   implies all of the following superordinate 'hrn:' URIs

      hrn://abc.com/288918293/3/en/global
      hrn://abc.com/288918293/3/en
      hrn://abc.com/288918293/3
      hrn://abc.com/288918293
      hrn://abc.com

   No special meaning or interpretation is ascribed by this
   specification to particular 'hrn:' URI levels or to the relations
   between 'hrn:' URI levels other than the following:

      o  the first level of an 'hrn:' URI corresponds to the authority
         defining the name hierarchy (which may be implicit in a UUID
         root name as indicated by a hyphen '-')

      o  the second level of an 'hrn:' URI corresponds to the manditory
         root name

      o  each of the levels beyond the second level corresponds to a
         sub-name

      o  the resource denoted by the 'hrn:' URI for a sub-name level is
         subordinate in some manner to all resources denoted by each
         name level 'hrn:' URI implied by its hierarchical structure

   A given application may choose to conduct queries based on implied
   superordinate 'hrn:' URIs to retrieve any properties of any
   superordinate resources which may be relevant to the interpretation
   of a given 'hrn:' URI.

   Other, more specialized, URI schemes which are derived from the
   'hrn:' URI scheme may ascribe more specific interpretations to
   particular levels implicit in the URI as well as more specific
   relational semantics between different levels.

   Note that the URI scheme prefix "hrn:" is considered to be a valid
   URI denoting this URI scheme, though it is not itself a valid URI
   according to this URI scheme.

4. Support for Autogenerated, Non-Mnemonic Names

   The UUID form of an 'hrn:' URI is intended for cases where a either
   an autogenerated or non-mnemonnic resource name is needed or
   desireable.
