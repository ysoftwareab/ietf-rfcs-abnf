Abstract

   This memo proposes an architecture for extending RTCP with a new RTCP
   XR (RFC3611) block type to report new metrics regarding media
   transmission or reception quality, as proposed in
   draft-ietf-avt-rtcp-guidelines (work in progress [replace with RFC
   number]).  This memo suggests that a new block should contain a
   single metric or a small number of metrics relevant to a single
   parameter of interest or concern, rather than containing a number of
   metrics which attempt to provide full coverage of all those
   parameters of concern to a specific application.  Applications may
   then "mix and match" to create a set of blocks which covers their set
   of concerns.  Where possible, a specific block should be designed to
   be re-usable across more than one application, for example, for all
   of voice, streaming audio and video.

1.  Introduction

   Any proliferation of metrics for transport and application quality
   monitoring has been identified as a potential problem for RTP/RTCP
   interoperability.  Different applications layered on RTP may have
   some monitoring requirements in common, which should be satisfied by
   a common design.  The objective here is to define an extensible
   framework and a small number of re-usable metrics to reduce
   implementation costs and to maximise inter-operability.  Work-in-
   progress on [GUIDELINES] has stated that, where RTCP is to be
   extended with a new metric, the preferred mechanism is by the
   addition of a new RTCP XR [RFC3611] block.  This memo assumes that
   any requirement for a new metric to be transported in RTCP will use a
   new RTCP XR block.

   [GUIDELINES] provides advice on when and how new metrics should be
   introduced, including recommending that metrics are based on existing
   standards whenever possible.

   Section 3 describes the key proposal of this memo, the use of small
   metrics blocks each of which addresses a single parameter of interest
   which may be "mixed and matched", rather than providing a large block
   to address all the parameters which might be of interest to a broad
   class of applications (for example, all VoIP applications).

   Section 4 describes an optimisation to avoid repetition of
   identification information, which becomes desirable when small blocks
   are used.

   Section 5 provides an example of the application of these principles
   to a specific case, that of a metric block to report packet delay
   variation.

   Section 6 draws attention to the guidance in [RFC3550] concerning
   RTCP and translators.

   Section 7 discusses the potential application of RTCP XR metrics
   blocks to the conferencing topologies discussed in [RFC5117].

   Section 8 consists (in this draft) only of an "Editor's note" asking
   whether the limited namespace available for RTCP XR blocks is a
   concern, and if so whether it would be desirable to work on a
   standardised means to expand it.

3.  Using small blocks

   Different applications using RTP for media transport certainly have
   differing requirements for metrics transported in RTCP to support
   their operation.  For many applications, the basic metrics for
   transport impairments provided in RTCP SR and RR packets [RFC3550]
   (together with source identification provided in RTCP SDES packets)
   are sufficient.  For other applications additional metrics may be
   required or at least sufficiently useful to justify the overheads,
   both of processing in endpoints and of increased session bandwidth.
   For example an IPTV application using Forward Error Correction (FEC)
   might use either a metric of post-repair loss or a metric giving
   detailed information about pre-repair loss bursts to optimise payload
   bandwidth and the strength of FEC required for changing network
   conditions.  However there are many metrics available.  It is likely
   that different applications or classes of applications will wish to
   use different metrics.  Any one application is likely to require
   metrics for more than one parameter but if this is the case,
   different applications will almost certainly require different
   combinations of metrics.  If larger blocks are defined containing
   multiple metrics to address the needs of each application, it becomes
   likely that many different such larger blocks are defined, which
   becomes a danger to interoperability.

   To avoid this pitfall, this memo proposes the use of small RTCP XR
   metrics blocks each containing a very small number of individual
   metrics characterising only one parameter of interest to an
   application running over RTP.  For example, at the RTP transport
   layer, the parameter of interest might be packet delay variation, and
   specifically the metric "IPDV" defined by [Y1540].  See Section 5 for
   architectural considerations for a metrics block, using as an example
   a metrics block to report packet delay variation.

4.  The identity block

   Any measurement must be identified.  However if metrics are delivered
   in small blocks there is a danger of inefficiency arising from
   repeating this information in a number of metrics blocks within the
   same RTCP packet, in cases where the same identification information
   applies to multiple metrics blocks.

   An instance of a metric must be identified using information which is
   likely to include most of the following:

   o  the node at which it was measured,

   o  the source of the measured stream (for example, its CNAME),

   o  the SSRC of the measured stream,

   o  the sequence number of the first packet of the RTP session,

   o  the extended sequence numbers of the first packet of the current
      measurement interval, and the last packet included in the
      measurement,

   o  the duration of the most recent measurement interval and

   o  the duration of the interval applicable to cumulative measurements
      (which may be the duration of the RTP session to date).

   [Editor's note: this set of information overlaps with, but is more
   extensive than, that in the union of similar information in RTCP RR
   packets.  Should we assume that RR information is always present if
   XR is sent, and that measurement intervals are exactly coincident?
   If so, state assumption and remove overlaps.  What were the design
   considerations which led to the additional information *not* being
   present in RRs?  The reason for the additional information here is
   the perceived difficulty of "locating" the *start* of the RTP session
   (sequence number of 1st packet, duration of interval applicable to
   cumulative measurements) using only RR.  Is this a misconception?  It
   leads to redundant information in this design because equivalent
   information is provided multiple times, once in *every*
   identification packet.  Though this ensures immunity to packet loss,
   the design is ugly and the overhead is not completely trivial.]

   This section proposes an approach to minimise the inefficiency of
   providing this identification information, assuming that an
   architecture based on small blocks means that a typical RTCP packet
   will contain more than one metrics block needing the same
   identification.  The choice of identification information to be

Internet-Draft        RTP Monitoring Architectures              May 2010


   provided is discussed in [IDENTITY] (work in progress).

   The approach is to define a stand-alone block containing only
   identification information, and to tag this identification block with
   a number which is unique within the scope of the containing RTCP XR
   packet.  The "containing RTCP XR packet" is defined here as the RTCP
   XR header with PT=XR=207 defined in Section 2 of [RFC3611] and the
   associated payload defined by the length field of this RTCP XR
   header.  The RTCP XR header itself includes the SSRC of the node at
   which all of the contained metrics were measured, hence this SSRC
   need not be repeated in the stand-alone identification block.  A
   single containing RTCP XR packet may contain multiple identification
   blocks limited by the range of the tag field.  Typically there will
   be one identification block per monitored source SSRC, but the use of
   more than one identification block for a single monitored source SSRC
   within a single containing RTCP XR packet is not ruled out.

   There will be zero or more metrics blocks dependent on each
   identification block.  The dependence of an instance of a metrics
   block on an identification block is established by the metrics
   block's having the same numeric value of the tag field as its
   identification block (in the same containing RTCP XR packet).

   Figure 1 below illustrates this principle using as an example an RTCP
   XR packet containing four metrics blocks, reporting on streams from
   two sources.  The measurement identity information is provided in two
   blocks with Block Type NMI, and tag values 0 and 1 respectively.

   Note: in this example, RTCP XR block type values for four proposed
   new block types (work in progress) are given as NMI, NPDV, NBGL and
   NDEL.  These represent numeric block type codepoints to be allocated
   by IANA at the conclusion of the work.

   Each of these two identity blocks will specify the SSRC of one of the
   monitored streams, as well as information about the span of the
   measurement.  There are two metrics blocks with tag=0 indicating
   their association with the measurement identity block which also has
   tag=0.  These are the two blocks following the identity block with
   tag=0, though this positioning is not mandatory.  There are also two
   metrics blocks with tag=1 indicating their association with the
   measurement identity block which also has tag=1, and these are the
   two blocks following the identity block with tag=1.

   [Editor's note: if we mandated that metrics blocks associated with an
   identity block must always follow the identity block we could save
   the tag field and possibly simplify processing.  Is this preferable
   to cross-referencing with a numeric tag?]

   In the example, the block types of the metrics blocks associated with
   tag=0 are BT=NPDV (a PDV metrics block) and BT=NBGL (a burst and gap
   loss metrics block).  The block types of the metrics blocks
   associated with tag=1 are BT=NPDV (a second PDV metrics block) and
   BT=NDEL (a delay metrics block).  This illustrates that:

   o  multiple instances of the same metrics block may occur within a
      containing RTCP XR packet, associated with different
      identification information, and

   o  differing measurements may be made, and reported, for the
      different streams arriving at an RTP system.

   This approach of separating the identification information is more
   costly than providing identification in each metrics block if only a
   single metrics block is sent in an RTCP packet, but becomes
   beneficial as soon as more than one metrics block shares common
   identification.

5.  An example of a metric block

   This section uses the example of an existing proposed metrics block
   to illustrate the application of the principles set out in Section 3.

   The example [PDV] (work in progress) is a block to convey information
   about packet delay variation (PDV) only, consistent with the
   principle that a metrics block should address only one parameter of
   interest.  One simple metric of PDV is available in the RTCP RR
   packet as the "jit" field.  There are other PDV metrics which may be
   more useful to certain applications.  Two such metrics are the IPDV
   metric ([Y1540], [RFC3393]) and the MAPDV2 metric [G1020].  Use of
   these metrics is consistent with the principle in Section 5 of
   [GUIDELINES] that metrics should usually be defined elsewhere, so
   that RTCP standards define only the transport of the metric rather
   than its nature.  The purpose of this section is to illustrate the
   architecure using the example of [PDV] (work in progress) rather than
   to document the design of the PDV metrics block or to provide a
   tutorial on PDV in general.

   Given the availability of at least three metrics for PDV, there are
   design options for the allocation of metrics to RTCP XR blocks:

   o  provide an RTCP XR block per metric

   o  provide a single RTCP XR block which contains all three metrics

   o  provide a single RTCP block to convey any one of the three
      metrics, together with a identifier to inform the receiving RTP
      system of the specific metric being conveyed

   In choosing between these options, extensibility is important,
   because additional metrics of PDV may well be standardised and
   require inclusion in this framework.  The first option is extensible
   but only by use of additional RTCP XR blocks, which may consume the
   limited namespace for RTCP XR blocks at an unacceptable rate.  The
   second option is not extensible, so could be rejected on that basis,
   but in any case a single application is quite unlikely to require
   transport of more than one metric for PDV.  Hence the third option
   was chosen.  This implies the creation of a subsidiary namespace to
   enumerate the PDV metrics which may be transported by this block, as
   discussed further in [PDV] (work in progress).

6.  Application to translators

   Section 7.2 of [RFC3550] describes processing of RTCP by translators.
   RTCP XR is within the scope of the recommendations of [RFC3550].
   Some RTCP XR metrics blocks may usefully be measured at, and reported
   by, translators.  As described in [RFC3550] this creates a
   requirement for the translator to allocate an SSRC for itself so that
   it may populate the SSRC in the RTCP XR packet header (although the
   translator is not a Synchronisation Source in the sense of
   originating RTP media packets).  It must also supply this SSRC and
   the corresponding CNAME in RTCP SDES packets.

   In RTP sessions where one or more translators generate any RTCP
   traffic towards their next-neighbour RTP system, other translators in
   the session have a choice as to whether they forward a translator's
   RTCP packets.  Forwarding may provide additional information to other
   RTP systems in the connection but increases RTCP bandwidth and may in
   some cases present a security risk.  RTP translators may have
   forwarding behaviour based on local policy, which might differ
   between different interfaces of the same translator.

   [Editor's note: for bidirectional unicast, an RTP system may usually
   detect RTCP from a translator by noting that the sending SSRC is not
   present in any RTP media packet.  However even for bidirectional
   unicast there is a possibility of a source sending RTCP before it has
   sent any RTP media (leading to transient mis-categorisation of an RTP
   end system or RTP mixer as a translator), and for multicast sessions
   - or unidirectional/streaming unicast - there is a possibility of a
   receive-only end system being permanently mis-categorised as a
   translator.  Is there a need for a translator to declare itself
   explicitly?  Needs further thought.]

7.  Application to RFC 5117 topologies

   An RTP system (end system, mixer or translator) which originates,
   terminates or forwards RTCP XR blocks is expected to handle RTCP,
   including RTCP XR, as specified in [RFC3550] for that class of RTP
   systems.  Provided this expectation is met, an RTP system using RTCP
   XR is architecturally no different from an RTP system of the same
   class (end system, mixer, or translator) which does not use RTCP XR.
   This statement applies to the topologies investigated in [RFC5117],
   where they use RTP end systems, RTP mixers and RTP translators as
   these classes are defined in [RFC3550].

   These topologies are specifically Topo-Point-to-Point, Topo-
   Multicast, Topo-Translator (both variants, Topo-Trn-Translator and
   Topo-Media-Translator, and combinations of the two), and Topo-Mixer.

   The topologies based on systems which do not behave according to
   [RFC3550], that is Topo-Video-Switch-MCU and Topo-RTCP-terminating-
   MCU, suffer from the difficulties described in [RFC5117].  These
   difficulties apply to systems sending, and expecting to receive, RTCP
   XR blocks as much as to systems using other RTCP packet types.  For
   example, a participant RTP end system may send media to a video
   switch MCU.  If the media stream is not selected for forwarding by
   the switch, neither RTCP RR packets nor RTCP XR blocks referring to
   the end system's generated stream will be received at the RTP end
   system.  Strictly the RTP end system can only conclude that its RTP
   has been lost in the network, though an RTP end system complying with
   the robustness principle of [RFC1122] should survive with essential
   functions unimpaired.

8.  Expanding the RTCP XR block namespace

   [Editor's note: the RTCP XR block namespace is limited by the 8-bit
   block type field in the RTCP XR header (Section 3 of [RFC3611]).
   IESG have noted that this is potentially restrictive.  It would be
   possible to standardise an expansion mechanism, probably based on use
   of a new field near the start of the variable-length "type-specific
   block contents" field.  Clearly this could apply only to new block
   types, so might be standardised to apply to some subrange of the
   current 8-bit range, for example the range 128 through 191 might be
   used.  At time of writing, block types 12 to 254 are unassigned and
   255 is reserved for future expansion.  Is there a consensus for, or
   against, work to allow expansion?  One potential use is through
   hierarchical control, where one or a few codepoints at the top level
   are given to other SDOs who may then define a number of metrics
