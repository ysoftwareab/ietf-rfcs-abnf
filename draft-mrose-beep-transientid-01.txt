Abstract

   As a part of their deliverables, working groups of the IETF may
   develop BEEP profiles.  During the development process, it is
   desirable to assign a transient identifier to each profile.  If the
   profile is subsequently published as an RFC, then a permanent
   identifier is subsequently assigned by the IANA.

Internet-Draft       Transient IDs for BEEP Profiles      September 2001


1. Introduction

   Each BEEP profile [1] is identified by a URI [2].

   If the BEEP profile appears on the standards-track [3], then the IANA
   is responsible for assigning the URI associated with the BEEP
   profile.  Otherwise, the entity specifying the BEEP profile is free
   to assign a URI under its administration to the profile.

   If a working group of the IETF is developing a BEEP profile, then,
   during the development process, it is desirable to use a transient
   identifier for the profile.  Further, it is desirable that the
   transient identifier be associated with the working group.

   This memo defines the practice for making such an assignment.  Note
   that this practice does not apply to activities outside of working
   groups -- anyone able to assign a URL is capable of defining a URI
   for the purposes of identifying the BEEP profiles that they develop.

2. Practice

   When a working group is formed, the IETF secretariat assigns a brief
   mneumonic prefix to the working group, e.g., "provreg" or "sacred".

   When a working group begins development of a document which specifies
   a BEEP profile, the working group chair assigns a transient
   identifier of the form "http://iana.org/beep/transient/XXX/YYY" where
   "XXX" is the working group's mneumonic and "YYY" is a unique string.
   Although the resulting URI must conform to the URI syntax, the "YYY"
   portion is otherwise arbitrary.  For example, it may contain a sub-
   hierarchy (e.g., "epp/1.0").

   For example,

       http://iana.org/beep/transient/provreg/epp/1.0
       http://iana.org/beep/transient/sacred/pdm

   might be assigned by the chairs of the "provreg" and "sacred" working
   groups, respectively.

   Following this, the working group chair completes a BEEP profile
   registration template, and submits this information to the IANA.

   Note that although the IETF hasn't established a practice with
   respect to the use of capitalization in URLs employed for namespace
   purposes, the W3C has a lowercase-only policy.  Working group chairs
   are encouraged to consider this when making assignments.

Appendix A. Acknowledgements

   The author gratefully acknowledges the contributions of: Dan Kohn and

Appendix B. IANA Considerations

   The IANA maintains a registry of transient identifiers used for BEEP
   profiles under development in the IETF, using the profile
   registration template defined in Section 5.1 of [1].

   Note that unlike the registration procedures defined in Appendix B of
   [1], the working group chair (instead of the IESG) is responsible for
   authorizing the registration.
