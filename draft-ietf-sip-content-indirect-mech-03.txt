Abstract

   This document proposes an extension to the URL MIME External- Body
   Access-Type to satisfy the content indirection requirements for SIP.
   These extensions are aimed at allowing any MIME part in a SIP message
   to be referred to indirectly via a URI.

2. Introduction

   The purpose of the Session Initiation Protocol [2] (SIP) is to
   create, modify, or terminate sessions with one or more participants.
   SIP messages, like HTTP, are sytnactically composed of a start line,
   one or more headers, and an optional body. Unlike HTTP, SIP is not
   designed as a general purpose transport of data.

   There are numerous reasons why it might be desirable to indirectly
   specify the content of the SIP message body. For bandwidth limited
   applications such as cellular wireless, indirection provides a means
   to annotate the (indirect) content with meta-data which may be used
   by the recipient to determine whether or not to retrieve the content
   over the resource limited link.

   It is also possible that the content size to be transferred might
   potentially overwhelm intermediate signaling proxies, thereby
   unnecessarily increasing network latency. For time-sensitive SIP
   applications, this may be unacceptable. Indirect content can remedy
   this by moving the transfer of this content out of the SIP signaling
   network and into a potentially separate data transfer channel.

   There may also be scenarios where the session related data (body)
   that needs to be conveyed does not directly reside on the endpoint or
   User Agent. In such scenarios, it is desirable to have a mechanism
   whereby the SIP message can contain an indirect reference to the
   desired content. The receiving party would then use this indirect
   reference to retrieve the content via a non-SIP transfer channel such
   as HTTP, FTP, or LDAP.

   The purpose of content indirection is purely to provide an
   alternative transport mechanism for SIP MIME body parts.  With the
   exception of the transport mechanism, indirected body parts are
   equivalent, and should have the same treatment, as in-line body
   parts.

   Previous attempts at solving the content indirection problem made use
   of the text/uri-list [7] MIME type. While attractive for its
   simplicity (a list of URIs delimted by end-of-line markers), it fails
   to satisfy a number of the requirements for a more general purpose
   content indirection mechanism in SIP. Most notably lacking is the
   ability to specify various attributes on a per-URI basis. These
   attributes might include version information, the MIME type of the
   referenced content, etc.

   In searching for a replacement for the text/uri-list MIME type,
   RFC2017 defines a strong candidate. RFC2017 defines an extension to
   the message/external-body MIME type originally defined in RFC2046



Olson                   Expires December 1, 2003                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft    Content Indirection in SIP Messages          June 2003


   [5]. The extension that RFC2017 makes is to allow a generic URI to
   specify the location of the content rather than protocol specific
   parameters for FTP, etc. as originally defined in RFC2046. While
   providing most of the functionality needed for a SIP content
   indirection mechanism, RFC2017 by itself is not a complete solution.
   This document will specify the usage of RFC2017 necessary to fulfill
   the requirments outlined for content indirection.

   The requirements can be classified as applying either to the URI
   which indirectly references the desired content or to the content
   itself. Where possible, existing MIME parameters and entity headers
   will be used to satisfy those requirements. MIME (Content-Type)
   parameters will be the preferred manner of describing the URI while
   entity headers will be the preferred manner of describing the
   (indirect) content. See RFC 2045 [4] for a description of most of
   these entity headers and MIME parameters.

3. Example Use Cases

   There are several example users of such a content indirection
   mechanism. These are examples only and are not intended to limit the
   scope or applicability of the mechanism.

3.1 Presence Notification

   The information carried in a presence document could potentially
   exceed the recommended size for a SIP (NOTIFY) request, particularly
   if the document carries aggregated information from multiple
   endpoints. In such a situation, it would be desirable to send the
   NOTIFY request with an indirect pointer to the presence document
   which could then be retrieved by, for example, HTTP.

   Figure 1: Example information flow for presence notification


             Watcher                 Presence Server
                |                           |
                |         SUBSCRIBE         |
                |-------------------------->|
                |          200 OK           |
                |<--------------------------|
                |                           |
                |          NOTIFY           |
                |-------------------------->|
                |          200 OK           |
                |<--------------------------|
                |                           |
                |      NOTIFY (w/URI)       |
                |<--------------------------|
                |           200             |
                |-------------------------->|
                |                           |
                |         HTTP GET          |
                |-------------------------->|
                |                           |
                | application/cpim-pidf+xml |
                |<--------------------------|
                |                           |



   In this example, the presence server returns an HTTP URI pointing to
   a presence document on the presence server which the watcher can then
   fetch using an HTTP GET.

3.2 Document Sharing

   During an instant messaging conversation, a useful service is
   document sharing wherein one party sends an IM (MESSAGE request) with
   an indirect pointer to a document which is meant to be rendered by
   the remote party. Carrying such a document directly in the MESSAGE
   request is not appropriate for most documents. Furthermore, the
   document to be shared may reside on a completely independent server
   from the originating party.

   Figure 2: Example information flow for document sharing


               UAC                  UAS         Web Server
                |                    |                |
                |   MESSAGE w/URI    |                |
                |------------------->|                |
                |        200         |                |
                |<-------------------|                |
                |                    |                |
                |                    |    HTTP GET    |
                |                    |--------------->|
                |                    |   image/jpeg   |
                |                    |<---------------|
                |                    |                |



   In this example, a user wishes to exchange a JPEG image that she has
   stored on her web server with another user she has a IM conversation
   with. The JPEG is intended to be rendered inline in the IM
   conversation. The recepient of the MESSAGE request launches a HTTP
   GET request to the web server to retrieve the JPEG image.

4. Requirements

      It MUST be possible to specify the location of content via a URI
      [3].

      It MUST be possible to specify the length of the indirect content.

      It MUST be possible to specify the type of the indirect content.

      It MUST be possible to specify the disposition of each URI
      independently.

      It MUST be possible to label each URI to identify if and when the
      content referred to by that URI has changed. Applications of this
      mechanism may send the same URI more than once. The intention of
      this requirement is to allow the receiving party to determine if
      the content referenced by the URI has changed without having to
      actually retrieve that content. Example ways the URI could be
      labelled include a sequence number, timestamp, version number,
      etc.

      It MUST be possible to specify the timespan for which a given URI
      is valid. This may or may not be the same as the lifetime for the
      content itself.

      It MUST be possible for the UAC and the UAS to indicate support of
      this content indirection mechanism. A fallback mechanism SHOULD be
      specified in the event that one of the parties is unable to
      support content indirection.

      It MUST be possible for the UAC and UAS to negotiate the type of
      the indirect content when using the content indirection mechanism.

      It MUST be possible for the UAC and UAS to negotiate support for
      URI scheme(s) to be used in the content indirection mechanism.
      This is in addition to the ability to negotiate the content type.

      It SHOULD be possible to ensure the integrity and privacy of the
      URI when it is received by the remote party.

      It MUST be possible to process the content indirection without
      human intervention.

      It MUST allow for indirect transference of content in any SIP
      message which would otherwise carry that content as a body.

5. Application of RFC2017 to the Content Indirection Problem

   The following text describes the application of RFC2017 to the
   requirements for content indirection.

5.1 Specifying support for content indirection

   A UAC/UAS may indicate support for content indirection through an
   Accept header containing the message/external-body MIME type. The
   UAC/UAS must supply additional values in the Accept header to
   indicate the content types that it is willing to accept either
   directly or through content indirection. User-Agents supporting
   content indirection MUST support content indirection of the
   application/sdp MIME type.

   For example:


         Accept: message/external-body, image/*, application/sdp


5.2 Mandatory support for HTTP URI

   Applications which use this content indirection mechanism MUST
   support at least the HTTP URI scheme. Additional URI schemes MAY be
   used, but a UAC/UAS MUST support receiving a HTTP URI for indirect
   content if it advertises support for content indirection.

   The intention is to establish a baseline of support to further
   strengthen interoperability. Implementors may design for the most
   common case (HTTP) without having to worry about negotiation of
   support for this particular URI scheme.

5.3 Rejecting content indirection

   If a UAS receives a SIP request which contains a content indirection
   payload, and the UAS cannot or does not wish to support such a
   content type, it MUST reject the request with a 415 Unsupported Media
   Type response as defined in section 21.4.13 of SIP [2]. In
   particular, the UAC should note the absence of the message/
   external-body MIME type in the Accept header of this response to
   indicate that the UAS does not support content indirection.

5.4 Specifying the location of the content via a URI

   The URI for the indirect content is specified in a "URI" parameter of
   the message/external-body MIME type. An access-type parameter
   indicates that the external content is referenced by a URI.



Olson                   Expires December 1, 2003                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft    Content Indirection in SIP Messages          June 2003


   For example:


         Content-Type: message/external-body;
                       access-type="URL";
                       URL="http://www.volcano.com/the-indirect-content"


5.5 Specifying versioning information for the URI

   In order to determine whether or not the content indirectly
   referenced by the URI has changed, a Content-ID entity header is
   used. The syntax of this header is defined in RFC2045 [4]. Changes in
   the underlying content referred to by a URI MUST result in a change
   in the Content-ID associated with that URI. Multiple SIP messages
   carrying URI that refer to the same content SHOULD reuse the same
   Content-ID to allow the receiver to cache this content and avoid
   unnecessary retrievals. The Content-ID is intended to be globally
   unique and SHOULD be temporally unique across SIP dialogs.

   For example:


         Content-ID: <4232423424@www.volcano.com>


5.6 Specifying the lifetime of the URI

   The URI supplied by in Content-Type header is not required to be
   accessible or valid for an indefinite period of time.  Rather, the
   supplier of the URI MUST specify the time period for which this URI
   is valid and accessible.  This is done through an "EXPIRATION"
   parameter of the Content-Type.  The format of this expiration
   parameter is a RFC1123 date-time value.  This is further restricted
   in this application to use only GMT time, consistent with the Date:
   header in SIP.  This is a mandatory parameter. Note that the
   date-time value can range from minutes to days or even years.

   For example:


         Content-Type: message/external-body;
                       expiration="Mon, 24 June 2002 09:00:00 GMT"


5.7 Specifying the type of the indirect content

   To support existing SIP mechanisms for the negotiation of content

Internet-Draft    Content Indirection in SIP Messages          June 2003


   types, a Content-Type entity header SHOULD be present in the entity
   (payload) itself. If the protocol (scheme) of the URI supports its
   own content negotiation mechanisms (e.g. HTTP), this header may be
   omitted. The sender MUST however be prepared for the receiving party
   to reject content indirection if the receiver is unable to negotiate
   an appropriate MIME type using the underlying protocol for the URI
   scheme.

   For example:


         Content-Type: message/external-body; access-type="URL";
                       expiration="Mon, 24 June 2002 09:00:00 GMT";
                       URL="http://www.volcano.com/the-indirect-content"
         <CRLF>
         Content-Type: application/sdp
         <CRLF>


5.8 Specifying the size of the indirect content

   When known in advance, the size of the indirect content should be
   supplied via a size parameter on the Content-Type header. This is an
   extension of RFC2017 but in line with other access types defined for
   the message/external-body MIME type in RFC2046. The content size is
   useful for the receiving party to make a determination about whether
   or not to retrieve the content. As with directly supplied content, a
   UAS may return a 513 error response in the event the content size is
   too large. This is an optional parameter.

   For example:


         Content-Type: message/external-body; access-type="URL";
                       expiration="Mon, 24 June 2002 09:00:00 GMT";
                       URL="http://www.volcano.com/the-indirect-content";
                       size=4123


5.9 Specifying the purpose of the indirect content

   A Content-Disposition entity header SHOULD be present for all
   indirect content. In the absence of an an explicit
   Content-Disposition header, a content disposition of "session" should
   be assumed.

   For example:

Internet-Draft    Content Indirection in SIP Messages          June 2003


         Content-Type: message/external-body; access-type="URL";
                       expiration="Mon, 24 June 2002 09:00:00 GMT";
                       URL="http://www.volcano.com/the-indirect-content"
         <CRLF>
         Content-Type: image/jpeg
         Content-Disposition: render


5.10 Specifying multiple URIs for content indirection

   If there is a need to send multiple URIs for the purpose of content
   indirection, an appropriate multipart MIME type [5] should be used.
   Each URI should be contained in a single entity. Indirect content may
   be mixed with directly supplied content. This is particularly useful
   with the multipart/alternative MIME type.

   For example:


        MIME-Version: 1.0
        Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=boundary42

        --boundary42
        Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

        The company announcement for June, 2002 follows:
        --boundary42
        Content-Type: message/external-body;
                      access-type="URL";
                      expiration="Mon, 24 June 2002 09:00:00 GMT";
   		   URL="http://www.volcano.com/announcements/07242002";
   		   size=4123

        Content-Type: text/html
        Content-Disposition: render

        --boundary42--


5.11 Supplying additional comments about the indirect content

   Optional, freeform text may be supplied to comment on the indirect
   content. This should be supplied in a Content-Description entity

5.12 Relationship to Call-Info, Error-Info, and Alert-Info Headers

   SIP [2] defines three headers which are used to supply additional
   information with regard to a session, a particular error response, or
   alerting. All three of these headers allow the UAC or UAS to indicate
   additional information through a URI. They may be considered a form
   of content indirection. The content indirection mechanism defined in
   this document is not intended as a replacement for these headers.
   Rather, the headers defined in SIP MUST be used in preference to this
   mechanism where applicable because of the well defined semantics of
   those headers.

7. Security Considerations

   Any content indirection mechanism introduces additional security
   concerns. By its nature, content indirection requires an extra
   processing step and information transfer. There are a number of
   potential abuses of a content indirection mechanism:

      Content indirection allows the initiator to choose an alternative
      protocol with weaker security or known vulnerabilities for the
      content transfer. For example, asking the recipient to issue an
      HTTP request which results in a Basic authentication challenge.

      Content indirection allows the initiator to ask the recipient to
      consume additional resources in the information transfer and
      content processing, potentially creating an avenue for denial of
      service attacks. For example, an active FTP URL consuming 2
      connections for every indirect content message.

      Content indirection could be used as a form of port scanning
      attack where the indirect content URL is actually a bogus URL
      pointing to an internal resource of the recipient. The response to
      the content indirection request could reveal information about
      open (and vulnerable) ports on these internal resources.

      A content indirection URL can disclose sensitive information about
      the initiator such as an internal user name (as part of an HTTP
      URL) or possibly geolocation information.

   Fortunately, all of these potential threats can be mitigated through
   careful screening of both the indirect content URIs that are received
   as well as those that are sent. Integrity and privacy protection of
   the indirect content URI can prevent additional attacks as well.

   For confidentiality, integrity, and authentication, this content
   indirection mechanism relies on the security mechanisms outlined in
   RFC3261. In particular, the usage of S/MIME as defined in section 23
   of RFC3261 provides the necessary mechanism to ensure integrity
   protection and privacy of the indirect content URI and associated
   parameters.

   Securing the transfer of the indirect content is the responsibility
   of the underlying protocol used for this transfer. It is RECOMMENDED
   that applications implementing this content indirection method
   support the HTTPS URI scheme for secure transfer of content.

   Access control to the content referenced by the URI is not defined by
   this specification. Access control mechanisms may be defined by the
   protocol for the scheme of the indirect content URI.
