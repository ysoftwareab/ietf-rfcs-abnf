Abstract

   This document describes Transport Layer Security (TLS) authentication
   using Raw-Public-Key and Pre-Shared-Key as new mechanisms for OAuth

1.  Introduction

   This document describes Transport Layer Security (TLS) authentication
   using Raw-Public-Key and Pre-Shared-Key as the mechanism for OAuth
   client authentication.  Examples of endpoint requiring client
   authentication are token and introspection.

   The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework [RFC6749] defines a shared
   secret method of client authentication but also allows for the
   definition and use of additional client authentication mechanisms
   when interacting with the authorization server's token endpoint.
   This document describes two additional mechanisms of client
   authentication utilizing Raw-Public-Key [RFC7250] and Pre-Shared-Key
   TLS [RFC4279], which provide better security characteristics than
   shared secrets.

   To get most bennefits and improved security with these new client
   credential types it is recomended to use the 'one credential per
   Client Software Instance' paradigm.  This can be achived by letting
   the client dynamicly register as described in [RFC7591].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Pre-Shared-Key for Client Authentication

   The following section defines, as an extension of OAuth 2.0,
   Section 2.3 [RFC6749], using Pre-Shared-Key with TLS [RFC4279] to
   authenticate the client.  This method is registered as
   'tls_client_psk' in "OAuth Token Endpoint Authentication Methods"
   registry.  If this method is to be used, the client and the
   Authorization Server MUST share a secret key, and they MUST agree on
   an identifier for this key.

   The (D)TLS handshake MUST be done according to [RFC4279], with the
   client indicating support for one or more Pre-Shared-Key cipher
   suites and authorization server selecting a Pre-Shared-Key cipher
   suite.  In order to enable the authorization server to select the
   correct pre-shared-key the client MUST send the key identifier in the
   psk-identity field of the ClientKeyExchange message.  How the
   authorization server maps the identifier to a pre-shared-key, and to
   a specific client is out of scope for this specification.

   Note that the key identifier MUST be 2^16 bytes or shorter, in order
   to fit into the psk-identity field.

3.  Raw-Public-Key for Client Authentication

   The following section defines, as an extension of OAuth 2.0,
   Section 2.3 [RFC6749], the use of Raw-Public-Key with (D)TLS
   [RFC7250] to authenticate the client.  This method is registered as
   'tls_client_rpk' in "OAuth Token Endpoint Authentication Methods"
   registry.

   The (D)TLS handshake MUST be done according to [RFC7250], with the
   client indicating support for Raw-Public-Key certificates and the
   authorization server asking client send its Raw Public Key
   certificate.  Since the client cannot send an explicit client or key
   identifier in the handshake, the authorization server MUST derive a
   client identifier from RPK that the client uses.

   Note to implementers: Authorization servers can use the following
   method to map a Raw Public Key to a client identifier: The client
   identifier is generated from the Raw Public Key using the procedure
   specified in section 3 of [RFC6920].  The digest is calculated on the
   Raw Public Key only (not on the SubjectPublicKeyInfo used in the
   handshake).  An example is shown in Figure 1.

4.  Dynamic Registration

   For dynamic registration of a RPK this specification registers the
   new parameter 'rpk' to the Client Registration Metadata Registry.
   When used this parameter MUST contain a JSON Web Key representing the
   public key of the client.  When 'rpk' is present in the registration
   request 'token_endpoint_auth_method' MUST include 'tls_client_rpk'.

   For dynamic registration of a PSK this specification registers the
   new parameter 'psk' to the Client Registration Metadata Registry.
   When used this parameter MUST contain a JSON Web Key representing the
   key of the client.  When registering the client can include the key
   in the registrations request or the authorisation can generate the
   key and return it.  If the 'psk' attribute is present in a request
   'token_endpoint_auth_method' MUST include 'tls_client_psk'.  To
   request the authorisation server to generate the key the client
   includes 'tls_client_psk' in 'token_endpoint_auth_method' but does
   not send 'psk' attribute.

   The 'jwks' and 'jwks_uri' is not used to avoid conflict and confusion
   with application layer keys.
