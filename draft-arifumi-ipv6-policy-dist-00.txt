   selecting an appropriate destination and source addresses.

Internet-Draft          Policy Table Distribution               Dec 2005


1.  Introduction

   This document describes some practical usages of the distribution
   mechanism for default address selection policy that is defined in
   another document.  [T. Fujisaki]

   IPv6 is originally designed to be able to have multiple addresses on
   a network interface.  RFC 3484 [RFC3484] defines some default rules
   by which destination address and a source addresses are selected
   among two or more addresses.  Also, RFC 3484 address selection
   mechanism is implemented on major OSes.  However, we've found that
   some important cases where those default rules aren't enough.  Even
   in those cases, you can make a host to select a correct address by
   configuring address selection policy table correctly.

   There is, however, no mechanism to automatically configure policy
   table from outside of the host like routing protocol for routing
   table.  It is almost non-sense to force every user to configure
   Policy Table manually, to inform users of relatively large amount of
   policies and to make them change Policy Table configuration every
   time the backbone topology or address space changes.  So we propose a
   mechanism to distribute address selection policy.

   Our proposal is a new option for DHCPv6 [RFC3315] and its format is
   defined in another document.  This document illustrates practical
   examples that benefit from our proposing protocol.


2.  Practical Use Example

2.1.  Case 1: IPv4 and IPv6 prioritization

   The default policy for policy table gives IPv6 addresses higher
   precedence than IPv4 addresses.  There seems to be a lot of cases,
   however, where network administrators want to control end nodes
   address selection policy otherwise.

                             [Fig. 1]

   In the figure above, a site has native IPv4 and tunneled IPv6
   connectivity.  Therefore, the administrator of this site knows
   communication quality of IPv6 is much worse than IPv4.  This kind of
   problem can be solved by applying the following policy table to
   hosts.

        Prefix          Precedence  Label
        ::/0            20          1
        ::ffff:0:0/96   10          2

   The administrator can indicate that IPv4 should take precedence over
   IPv6, while keeping to provide both IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity, by
   delivering DHCPv6 Default Address Selection Option that includes the
   policy above.

2.2.  Case 2: ULA or Global Prioritization

   By default, the scope of these addresses is global.  Also, unlike
   site-locals, a site may have more than one of these prefixes and use
   them at the same time.  By making use of this characteristics, you
   can achieve strong and simple access control.  Like the figure below,
   a web server has both ULA [RFC4193] and Global IPv6 addresses.  A
   host in this site also has both addresses.

   By configuring client address based access control at the web server,
   a client with ULA gets in internal only web pages and a client with
   Global address gets access to only public web pages.  As it is
   relatively easy to reject packets with ULA source address getting
   into the site at border router, this kind of access control seems to
   be reliable.

                             [Fig. 2]

   If you want to make in-site hosts to get into internal web site, you
   should deliver the following policies to them from the gateway.

        Prefix               Precedence Label
        fc00::/7                   20     1
        ::/0                       10     2

2.3.  Case 3: Multicast Source Address Selection

   This case is an example of Site-local or Global prioritization.  When
   you send a multicast packet across site-borders, the source address
   of the multicast packet has to be a global scope address.  The
   longest matching algorithm, however, selects a ULA address, if a
   sending host has both an ULA and a global address.

   The following policy fixes this incongruity.  For site-scope
   multicast, the destination address is in ff05::/16, and the source
   address should be ULA.  For global-scope multicast, the destination
   address is in ff0e::/16, and the source address will be global
   unicast address.


        Prefix        Precedence Label
        ff05::/16             10     5
        fc00::/7              10     5
        ff0e::/16             10     6
        2000::/3              10     6

   This is surely a workaround.  But, this clearly seems to be a defect
   of the rules of RFC 3484 and this is supposed to be fixed sooner.

2.4.  Case 4: Global-Closed Mixed Connectivity

   You can see another typical source address selection problem in a
   site with global-closed mixed connectivity like the figure below.  In
   this case, Host-A is in a multihomed network and has two IPv6
   addresses delegated from each of up-stream ISPs.  Note that ISP2 is
   closed network and doesn't have connectivity to the Internet.

                                   [Fig. 3]

   Host-C is located somewhere in the Internet and has an IPv6 address
   3ffe:503:c:1:EUI64.  When Host-A sends a packet to Host-C, longest
   matching algorithm chooses 3ffe:1800:a:1:EUI64 for the source
   address.  In this case, the packet goes through ISP1 and may be
   filtered by ISP1's ingress filter.  Even if the packet isn't filtered
   by ISP1 fortunately, a return packet from Host-C won't possibly reach
   at Host-A, because the return packet is destined for 3ffe:1800:a:1:
   EUI64, which is closed from the Internet.

   In this case, the source address selection problem will be solved, if
   Host-A has the following policy table and the gateway has an
   appropriate routing table.

2.5.  Case 5: Renumbering Site Prefix

   RFC 4192 [RFC4192] describes a recommended procedure to renumber a
   network from one prefix to another.  An auto-configured address has a
   lifetime, so by stopping advertisement old prefix is invalidated
   eventually.

   However, you can make this transition more rapid and smooth by
   injecting address selection policy like below.

                                                         |
                           +-----+---+
                           | Gateway |
                           +----+----+
                                |  2001:db8:a:1::/64  (new)
                                |  3ffe:1800:a:1::/64 (old)
                      ------+---+----------
                            |
                         +--+-----+ 2001:db8:a:1:EUI64  (new)
                         | Host-A | 3ffe:1800:a:1:EUI64 (old)
                         +--------+

                                   [Fig. 4]


        Prefix                Precedence   Label
        2001:db8:a:1::/64     20           1
        ::/0                  20           1
        3ffe:1800:a:1::/64    10           2

   In addition to whole site renumbering, partial site renumbering may
   be getting more common.  For example, ISP's customer prefix
   renumbering may be helpful for privacy protection.  This is common
   with IPv4, but you can provide smooth renumbering in IPv6.


3.  Security Considerations

   With regard to the possibility of traffic abduction through the
   announcement of a bogus policy, this scheme seems to neither lower
   nor raise the security level obtained by the existing base-protocols,
   such as DHCP-PD, DHCP and RA.  However, it does raise the possibility
   of a new form of DoS attack on routers and hosts, in which large
   numbers of address-selection policies are generated by different
   source addresses.  We will have to discuss this and take
   precautionary measures in designing the protocol specification.
