Hello,

In the recently published RFC 3926 authored by you I found
a multi-facetted issue regarding the MIME document citations:

(1) On page 31, the Informative Reference "[21]" is inconsistent;
    author, title, and publication month / year match RFC 2047,
    *not* "RFC 1521" as stated there.

(2) The first use of reference "[21]" appears on page 27, in the
    10th line of the 2nd paragraph. There, "RFC 2047" _might_ be
    what you meant (together with [20] pointing to RFC 2048).

    Now, unfortunately, the current basic MIME specifications,
    RFC 2045..2049, do not contain a substantial general
    discussion of security issues.

    The RFC 2045 and RFC 2049 "Security Considerations" just
    refer to RFC 2046.
    But RFC 2046 for this purpose refers to two specific media
    type explanations / 'informal registrations' contained in
    the body of that memo, and to RFC 2048, which in turn
    does *NOT* contain a "Security Considerations" section.
(NB:
    - RFC 2048 just describes the registration PROCEDURES and
      states the Security Considerations *requirement* for any
      such registrations.
    - The formal ['skeleton'] Registrations for the basic MIME
      content types / subtypes from RFC 1521 - Appendix F -
      unfortunately have been lost on their [expected] way
      into RFC 2046. )

    RFC 2047, in particular, is an extreme:
      "Security issues are not discussed in this memo."
    (Section 10 on page 14).

    Therefore I suspect that "RFC 2047" might indeed NOT be
    what you wanted to refer to in loc. cit.  Perhaps the
    combination of RFC 2046 and RFC 2048 would have been
    the most appropriate selection for this citation.

(3) The second use of reference "[21]" in RFC 3926 appears
    2 lines further down in the same paragraph on page 27,
    explicitely referring to RFC 1521.
    The final statement there on RFC 1521,
                                        "... even though
        its protocol is obsoleted by RFC 2048 [20]."

    as well does not seem to be very appropriate for me:
    It might be disputable whether one should talk about a
    "protocol" when talking about message/document format
    descriptions, but more substantially, the major part
    of RFC 1521 has been superseded by RFC 2046 - see (2)
    above - while RFC 2048 only supersedes Appendix E of
    RFC 1521, which at the time of its publication already
    had been "updated" (i.e. obsoleted) by RFC 1590.

Therefore, it might be appropriate to replace the impacted
bad Informative Reference citation [21] on page 31 of RFC 3926
by two citations (e.g. [21]' and [23]), one for RFC 1521 and
one for RFC 2046, and to modify the abovementioned phrase.

It might be useful to take a step to resolve these issues
by submitting an errata note to the RFC Editor's RFC Errata
web page -- please comment.


Additionally, I've found a lot of (~25) minor textual issues
(typos, grammar, formatting) in RFC 3926 which are perhaps
not worth of similar publication.
But, if you are interested in these - e.g. with respect to a
future re-publication of FLUTE as a Standards Track document -,
please let me know; I'll prepare a decription on your request.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,

reading the 'fresh' RFC 3966 authored by you, I've found two issues
to mention.


(1) -- a typo

I suspect a typo -- indeed tiny, but possibly distorting the meaning
of the example presented there -- on top of page 9 (in chapter 5.1.5).

>From the explanation given, I conclude that (in the 5th text line) :

         "+1-212-555-1 would not be a valid global context, ..."
                    ^^
in fact should read:

         "+1-212-555-01 would not be a valid global context, ..."
                    ^^^

If my suspicion is right, we perhaps should request the publication
of an errata note on the RFC-Editor's "RFC Errata" web page.


(2) -- Fate of "fax" and "modem" URI schemes

RFC 3966 re-defines the "tel" URI scheme and obsoletes RFC 2806
which defined (and registered) three URI schemes: "tel", "fax",
and "modem". Section 12 of RFC 3966 (on page 15) merely states
  "references to ... fax and modem URIs ... have been removed."
There are *no* IANA considerations included in RFC 3966 regarding
the latter URIs.

Hence it is not clear whether these URIs are to be regarded as
informally "deprecated" or "de-registered" by this RFC, and therefore
should be marked accordingly in the IANA 'URI Schemes' reqistry.

If however, by existing policy, URI schemes cannot be "deprecated"
or "de-registered", the RFC 3966 meta-information should be changed
to say "Updates: 2806" instead of "Obsoletes: 2806", and another
errata note should be filed to change the RFC 3966 heading
accordingly, to avoid the situation of having no more 'valid'
documentation for two registered URI schemes.

The fate of the "fax" and "modem" URI schemes should be made clear,
formally, and in an appropriate way.


Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

(1) is indeed a typo.

(2) requires discussion in the IPTEL working group, where I suggest you 
take this discussion. I have my personal opinions as to the deployment 
and deployability of the 'fax' URI scheme, but that's not particularly 
relevant. I suspect a separate document that performs the appropriate 
designation (e.g., historical) would be called for, rather than changing 
3996.

Hello,
I'd like to mention a few issues I found with the new RFC 3939
authored by you.

Please comment, and consider which of the items below should be
submitted for publication on the RFC Editor's RFC Errata web page.

In item (3), I have emphasized the proposed textual changes by a
change bar, '|', in column 1.


(1) Outdated Reference:

The last item in section '9.2. Informative References', on page 9,
names RFC 2806.
But, at the time of publication of RFC 3939, that RFC 2806 already
had been obsoleted by RFC 3966, published two weeks before RFC 3939 !

The reference [RFC2806] therefore should be updated accordingly
throughout the text.


(2) Missing IANA registrations ?

I suspect that -- beyond what indeed has been specified in section
'8. IANA Considerations' of RFC 3939 -- , according to BCP 90
(= RFC 3864), the new IMAIL Header Fields, "Caller-ID" and
"Caller-Name", as well should get formal IANA registrations listed
in the RFC, using the templates from section 4.2. of RFC 3864 !

Perhaps, a citation to BCP 90 would also have been appropriate.


(3) Minor textual improvements:

a) Change the first line of section 6.1., on page 6, from

  "The intent of these headers are to record telephone number that is
   sent by the analog phone system with an incoming call without
   alteration or interpretation." ...

to:

| "The intent of these headers are to record the telephone number that
   is sent by the analog phone system with an incoming call without
   alteration or interpretation." ...

b) In the first line of section '10. Acknowledgments', on page 9,
change:

  "The previous authors of versions of this document were Derrick Dunne
   and Jason Collins." ...

to:

| "The authors of previous versions of this document were Derrick Dunne
   and Jason Collins." ...


Regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
please let me note the textual issues I found with the newly
published RFC 3965 authored by you.

Obviously -- cf. the heading of Appendix B in the text -- there
has been a very substantial delay in the publication process of
this revision to RFC 2305. Nevertheless, many textual issues from
RFC 2305 have not been corrected with this updated version.

Please comment on the items below, and decide which of these
should be submitted to the RFC Editor for inclusion on the
RFC Errata web page.

I have emphasized below proposed textual changes by a change bar,
'|', in the first column.


(1) Issues with 'References' :
    ========================

a) Reference [3] is outdated and not used in the text.

   References [1] and [2] from RFC 2305 have been updated, from
   pointers to RFC 821 and RFC 822, to pointers to RFC 2821 and
   RFC 2822, respectively.
   The (normative) updates to RFC 821 and RFC 822 contained in
   STD 3, RFC 1123 [3], have been incorporated into RFC 2821
   and RFC 2822, respectively, which obsolete their predecessors.
   Hence, the reference to RFC 1123 is no more needed in RFC 3965,
   and in fact it is not mentioned in the textual body any more.

   Thus, the Normative Reference [3] should be deleted from section
   6.1., on page 10.

b) 'Oracle' in Reference [5].

   The Normative Reference [5] on page 10 contains a predicted
   publication month and year for RFC 3949, which is not correct.
   It should be updated to name the true publication month and
   year of RFC 3949, as soon as RFC 3949 really gets published
   -- it isn't yet  :-)  .

c) Reference [19] is outdated.

   RFC 2633 has been obsoleted by RFC 3851, published 5 months
   before RFC 3965.
   The Informative Reference [19], on page 11, should be updated
   accordingly.


(2) Textual corrections and enhancements :
    ====================================

a) Change the first sentence of section 2.1.3, on page 4, from:

  "An offramp gateway that operate as an MTA serving multiple users
   SHOULD use SMTP;" ...

to:

| "An offramp gateway that operates as an MTA serving multiple users
   SHOULD use SMTP;" ...

b) Change the first sentence of section 2.2.4, on page 4, from:

  "A single multi-page document SHOULD be sent as a single multi- page
   TIFF file, even though recipients MUST process multipart/mixed
   containing multiple TIFF files."

to:

| "A single multi-page document SHOULD be sent as a single multi-page
   TIFF file, even though recipients MUST process multipart/mixed
   containing multiple TIFF files."

c) Change section 5.1. on page 6 from:

  "This specification is based on use of existing Internet mail.  To
   maintain interoperability with Internet mail, any security to be
   provided should be part of the of the Internet security
   infrastructure, rather than a new mechanism or some other mechanism
   outside of the Internet infrastructure."

to:

| "This specification is based on the use of existing Internet mail.
   To maintain interoperability with Internet mail, any security to be
|  provided should be part of the Internet security infrastructure,
   rather than a new mechanism or some other mechanism outside of the
   Internet infrastructure."

d) Change the final sentence of section 5.2, on page 6, from:

                 ... "This section reviews relevant concerns about
   Internet mail for IFax environments, as well as considering the
   potential problems which can result of integrating the existing G3Fax
   service with Internet mail."

to:
                 ... "This section reviews relevant concerns about
   Internet mail for IFax environments, as well as considering the
|  potential problems which can result from integrating the existing
   G3Fax service with Internet mail."

e) Change the first paragraph of section 5.2.1, on page 6, from:

   "The actual sender of the message might not be the same as that
   specified in the Sender or From fields of the message content headers
   or the MAIL FROM address from the SMTP envelope."

to:

   "The actual sender of the message might not be the same as that
   specified in the Sender or From fields of the message content headers
|  or the MAIL FROM address in the SMTP envelope."

f) Change the second-to-last paragraph of section 5.2.2, on page 7,
from:

  "Originator authentication entails the use of weak or strong
   mechanisms, such as cleartext keywords or encryption-based
   data-signing, respectively, to determine and validate the identify
   of the sender and assess permissions accordingly."

to:

  "Originator authentication entails the use of weak or strong
   mechanisms, such as cleartext keywords or encryption-based
|  data-signing, respectively, to determine and validate the identity
   of the sender and assess permissions accordingly."

g) Change the first sentence of the last paragraph of section 5.2.3,
on page 8, from:

  "Typically authorization needs to be associated to specific senders
   and specific messages, in order to prevent a "replay" attack which
   causes and earlier authorization to enable a later dial-out by a
   different (and unauthorized) sender." ...

to:

| "Typically authorization needs to be associated with specific senders
   and specific messages, in order to prevent a "replay" attack which
|  causes an earlier authorization to enable a later dial-out by a
   different (and unauthorized) sender." ...

  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,

reading the fresh RFC 3967 (== BCP 97), I found that this memo uses
examples which are well known, but not very appropriate, for the
desired purpose:

(1)
    HMAC [RFC2104]

This algorithm - since almost three years - is a US Federal
Information Processing Standard!

( FIPS PUB 198, issued '2002 March 6' ;
  to download a PDF copy (updated '2002 April 8'), see
  <http://crc.nist.gov/publications/fips/index.html> )

This is an active standard published by a recognized standards body.
Therefore, *Normative References* to HMAC in future IETF Standards
Track documents should always refer to FIPS-198 instead of RFC 2104 !

Remark 1:
  FIPS-198 in turn refers to RFC 2104 as a readily available
  source document for the algorithm, but gives a detailed,
  independent description of the algorithm and its application.

Remark 2:
  Expect alternative MAC algorithms like UMAC, TTMAC, EMAC,
  and RMAC to get formally standardized soon by various Standards
  Bodies. For example, the former three Algorithms are already
  (since Feb. 2003) recommended for new applications to be used in
  the public administration and economy within the European Union.
  This has been the result of the NESSIE project - an open contest
  similar to the AES contest of NIST's), see
  <http://www.cryptonessie.org/> .


(2)
    MD5 [RFC1321]

According to the contemporary cryptographic literature, protocols
should now better use SHA-xxx (xxx = [1 / ] 224 / 256 / 384 / 512)
as a cryptographic hashing primitive instead of MD5.

See
- FIPS PUB 180-2, issued '2002 August 1', and amended by
  Change Note 1, issued '2004 February 25', for SHA-224,
and
- RFC 3174 (for SHA-1) and RFC 3874 (for SHA-224) -- based on above.

FIPS 180-2 should be used for Normative References in future IETF
Standards Track documents.

Remark 3:
  SHA-1 (as well as MD5) already is no more recommended for new
  applications to be used in the public administration and economy
  within the European Union, see the URL given in Remark 2 above!


Best Regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
I'd like to mention a couple of typos and other textual issues I've
found in the new RFC 3944 authored by you.

One general inconsistency observed throughout the text, is related
to the use of 'architecture' (singular) vs. 'architectures' (plural).
Since the H.350 series recommendations describe a *single*
[LDAP directory] architecture [extension], I propose to modify the
text to use the singular form in a consistent manner as noted below.

Further, there are a lot of places where I miss expected articles
('the' / 'a' / 'an') -- even in the text that is said to be copied
from the ITU-T Recommendations.

Please check the textual changes proposed below, and decide which
of these should be submitted to the RFC editor for inclusion on the
RFC Errata web page.
Modified lines are emphasized by a change bar "|" in the first column.


(1)

Change the first 4 (identical) lines of
-  'Abstract' on page 1,  and
-  '1. Scope' on page 3, from :

  "The International Telecommunications Union Standardization Sector
   (ITU-T) has created the H.350 series of Recommendations that specify
   directory services architectures in support of multimedia
   conferencing protocols.  The goal of the architecture is to" ...
                                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^!!
to:

  "The International Telecommunications Union Standardization Sector
   (ITU-T) has created the H.350 series of Recommendations that specify
|  a directory services architecture in support of multimedia
   conferencing protocols.  The goal of the architecture is to" ...


(2)

Change the second paragraph of '1. Scope' on page 3:

  "H.350 architectures are not intended to change the operation of
   multimedia conferencing protocols in any way.  Rather, they are meant
   to standardize the way the already defined protocol elements are
   stored in a directory, so that they can be accessed in a standardized
   manner."

to:

| "The H.350 architecture is not intended to change the operation of
|  multimedia conferencing protocols in any way.  Rather, it is meant
   to standardize the way the already defined protocol elements are
   stored in a directory, so that they can be accessed in a standardized
   manner."


(3)

In lines 2..4 of '4.1. Scope' on page 4, change:

                                   ... "Standardized directory services
   can support association of persons with endpoints, searchable white
   pages, and clickable dialling."  ...

to:

                                   ... "Standardized directory services
|  can support the association of persons with endpoints, searchable white
   pages, and clickable dialling."  ...


(4)

In the bottom half of the second paragraph of section 4.1. on
page 5, change:
                                                  ... "Each of these
   disparate systems can access the same underlying data source,
   reducing or eliminating the need to coordinate separate management of
   each system.  A significant benefit to the user is that the
   management of this data can be incorporated into existing customer
   management tools, allowing for quick and flexible scaling up of
   applications.  Indeed, many technology providers have already
   incorporate LDAP into their products, but have been forced to do so
   without benefit of a standardized schema." ...

to:
                                                  ... "Each of these
   disparate systems can access the same underlying data source,

   applications.  Indeed, many technology providers have already
   incorporate LDAP into their products, but have been forced to do so
|  without the benefit of a standardized schema." ...


(5)

In lines 3..7 of the forth paragraph of section 4.1. on page 5,
change:
                                                 ... "LDAP provides a
   convenient storage location that can be accessed by both call server
   and endpoint; thus it is possible to use the directory to support
   endpoint configuration, which is important for simplified operation
   and supporting user mobility."

to:
                                                 ... "LDAP provides a
   convenient storage location that can be accessed by both call server
|  and endpoint; thus it is possible to use the directory to support the
   endpoint configuration, which is important for simplified operation
   and supporting user mobility."


(6)

In the bottom half of the sixth paragraph of section 4.1. on page 6,
change:
                                ... "Similarly, commObject contains a
   pointer, called commOwner, which points to the individual or resource
   that is associated with the commObject.  In this way, people or
   resources can be associated with endpoints.  The only change required
   in the enterprise directory is the addition of the simple object
   class commURI.  CommObject data may be instantiated in the same or in
   entirely separate directories, thus allowing flexibility in
   implementation."

to:

|                               ... "Similarly, each commObject contains a
   pointer, called commOwner, which points to the individual or resource
   that is associated with the commObject.  In this way, people or

|  to the enterprise directory is the addition of the simple object
   class commURI.  CommObject data may be instantiated in the same or in
|  an entirely separate directory, thus allowing flexibility in
   implementation."


(7)

In the first lines of the final paragraph of section 4.1.2.1,
on page 9, change:

  "Note that this example and approach demonstrate extension of the
   general commObject object class, and not any individual H.350.x
   classes." ...

to:

| "Note that this example and approach demonstrate an extension of the
   general commObject object class, and not any individual H.350.x
   classes." ...


(8)

In the first line of section 4.2., on page 10, change:

  "Auxiliary object class that contains the commURI attribute." ...

to:

| "An Auxiliary object class that contains the commURI attribute." ...


(9)

Change the 'definition' clause of section 5.2.4., on page 20, from:

       "Address which specifies the domain location of SIP proxy within
   a domain.  RFC 3261 defines the role of the SIP proxy."

to:

|      "Address which specifies the domain location of a SIP proxy within
   a domain.  RFC 3261 defines the role of the SIP proxy."


(10)

In the second paragraph of section 6. (6th text line on page 27),
change:

  "(https//:videnet.unc.edu)"

to:

| "(https://videnet.unc.edu)"


(11)

In the first two lines of the second paragraph of section 7.,
on page 27, change:

  "H.350 does not alter the security architectures of any particular
   protocol."

  Alfred HÎnes.

There is a descrepancy in RFC2324 regarding the content type for HTCPCP 
requests. In section 2.1.1, the MIME type is 
"application/coffee-pot-command", while in section 4 the MIME type is 
"message/coffepot". I have not been able to reach the author regarding this.

Hi there,

during my current research effort regarding IS-IS, I have encountered a
problem with RFC1195.
Although I doubt that I am the first to realize an error of this magnitude,
I couldn't find an answer
to my question even after a considerable research effort.

In chapter '3.3 Addressing Routers in ISIS Packets' the RFC describes a
standard procedure
for deriving NSAP-addresses for IS in IP-only environments. However, the
DFI as well as the AA
are defined to be 'xx' and 'xx xx xx' respectively, which represents
neither a valid decimal nor
hexadecimal value.

Maybe you could be of assistance and point me to the correct location,
where I can find the
appropriate information...

Thanks for your effort...

Best regards

Joerg

P.S.: Please note that I did receive a delivery failed method with the
e-mail-address in cc

Hello,

I'd like to note some textual issues I found when reading
RFC 3816 (ROHC MIB) authored by you.

These remarks might be useful for either
- issuing an errata note for publication on the RFC Editor's
  RFC Errata web page, or else
- being kept in mind for the case that there should ever be
  planned an update to this RFC.

I use change bars ('|') in column 1 to emphasize modified text.


1) Minor issues in prose - simply grammar (singular - plural mismatches)

1a)
  Section 4.1.2., near the bottom of page 5, says:

                                                  "...  But when
   accessing the rohcInstanceTable (and the rohcContextTable that shares
   a part of its index with the rohcInstanceTable) there are many cases
   where either a compressor contexts or a decompressor contexts are of
   interest.  ..."

  It should say:

                                                  "...  But when
   accessing the rohcInstanceTable (and the rohcContextTable that shares
   a part of its index with the rohcInstanceTable) there are many cases
|  where either a compressor context or a decompressor context are of
   interest.  ..."

1b)
  Section 4.3.1., near the bottom of page 8, says:

                 "...  For compressor contexts it optionally contains
   managed object containing the numbers of allowed and used packet
   sizes.  ..."

  It should say:

                 "...  For compressor contexts it optionally contains
|  managed objects containing the numbers of allowed and used packet
   sizes.  ..."


2) Textual issues in the ROHC-MIB definition

2a)
  The DESCRIPTION clause of the `RohcChannelIdentifierOrZero'
  TEXTUAL-CONVENTION (near the bottom of page 10),

         "A number identifying a channel.
          The value of 0 is indicates that
          no channel is identified."

   should be:

         "A number identifying a channel.
|         The value of 0 indicates that
          no channel is identified."

2b)
  The DESCRIPTION clause for `rohcChannelEntry' (extending from
  the last 2 lines on page 11 to page 12) contains inappropriate
  text -- obviously borrowed from the Script MIB (RFC 3165,
  page 18, last 3 lines) and unintentionally left un-edited:

     "An entry describing a particular script.  Every script that
      is stored in non-volatile memory is required to appear in
      this script table.

      Note ..."

  This should be replaced by appropriate text, e.g.,

|    "An entry describing a particular ROHC channel.

      Note ..."

  [ Please add whatever you consider appropriate here! ]

2c)
  The DESCRIPTION clause for `rohcChannelFeedbackFor', on page 13,
  seems to me to be not strict enough. Perhaps,

      "If no feedback information is transferred on this channel,
       then the value of this ID is 0.  If the channel type is set
       to notInUse(1), then the value of this object must be 0.
       If the channel type is rohc(2) and the value of this object
       is a valid channel ID, then feedback information is
       piggy-backed on the ROHC channel.  If the channel type is

  should be replaced by:

      "If no feedback information is transferred on this channel,
       then the value of this ID is 0.  If the channel type is set
       to notInUse(1), then the value of this object must be 0.
       If the channel type is rohc(2) and the value of this object
|      is non-zero, then feedback information for this channel is
|      piggy-backed and/or interspersed on the same ROHC channel;
|      hence the value of this object must be equal to the value
|      of the indexing rohcChannelID.  If the channel type is
       dedicatedFeedback(3), ..."

  [or similar].

  Rationale:
  As far as I understand RFC 3095 (Section 5.2.2 et al.),
  it is not possible to intersperse or/and piggyback feedback
  information of another channel on a ROHC channel carrying
  payload packets.

2d)
  The DESCRIPTION clause for `rohcInstanceVendor', on page 15,
  contains two issues. Its first sentence contains the word
  "description" instead of "compression", and the second sentence
  is subject to mis-interpretation due to unfortunate placement of
  the words "allocated for the vendor".
  I propose to change the text:

      "An object identifier that identifies the vendor who
       provides the implementation of robust header description.
       This object identifier SHALL point to the object identifier
       directly below the enterprise object identifier
       {1 3 6 1 4 1} allocated for the vendor. ...

  to better read:

      "An object identifier that identifies the vendor who
|      provides the implementation of robust header compression.
       This object identifier SHALL point to the object identifier
|      allocated for the vendor directly below the `enterprise'
|      object identifier {1 3 6 1 4 1}. ...


2e)
  The DESCRIPTION clause for `rohcInstanceContextStorageTime',
  on page 17, says:

                      ... .  The value of this object is used
     to initialize rohcContexStorageTime object when a new
     context is created.
     Changing ...

  where it should better say:

                      ... .  The value of this object is used
|    to initialize the rohcContexStorageTime object when a new
     context is created.
     Changing ...

2f)
  To better distinguish the counters for payload (i. e. IP) packets
  from the counters IR packets, I recommend to enhance the sentence:

      "Counter of all packets passing this instance."

  to read:

|     "Counter of all IP packets passing this instance."

  in the DESCRIPTION clauses of following two objects:

  o   `rohcInstancePackets'       (page 18),
  o   `rohcContextPackets'        (page 25).

2g)
  The DESCRIPTION clause for `rohcProfileVendor', on page 21,
  contains the same two issues as the DESCRIPTION clause for
  `rohcInstanceVendor'. Hence, the modification given above,
  under 2d), should be applied here as well.

2h)
  The DESCRIPTION clause for `rohcProfileNegotiated', on page 21,
  contains a small typo. It says:

     "When retrieved, this boolean object returns true
      if the profile has been negotiated to be used at
      the instance, i.e., is supported also be the
      corresponding compressor/decompressor."

  It should say:

     "When retrieved, this boolean object returns true
      if the profile has been negotiated to be used at
|     the instance, i.e., is supported also by the
      corresponding compressor/decompressor."

2i)
  The DESCRIPTION clause for `rohcContextStorageTime', on page 24,
  contains an improper self-reference. Therefore, replace the text:

               ... .  This object returns  the remaining time
      that the row may exist before it is aged out.  The object
      is initialized with the value of the  associated
      rohcContextStorageTime object.  After expiration ...

  by:

               ... .  This object returns the remaining time
      that the row may exist before it is aged out.  The object
      is initialized with the value of the associated
|     rohcInstanceContextStorageTime object.  After expiration ...

          ^^^^^^^^

2j)
  The DESCRIPTION clauses for `ContextAllPacketsMeanSize' and
  `rohcContextAllHeadersMeanSize', on page 28, are concluded with
  the sentence:

      The mean value is given in byte rounded to the next
      integer value."

  This should be:

      The mean value is given in bytes rounded to the next
      integer value."

  [ Note: I wished this RFC (and many other MIB RFCs, too) would
    make frequent use of the UNITS clause specified in STD 58 ! ]


3) Textual issues in the ROHC-RTP-MIB definition

3a)
  The DESCRIPTION clause for `rohcRtpContextNACKs', on page 42,
  says:

     "The number of all dynamic negative feedbacks (ACK) sent
      or received in this context, respectively.
      ..."

  It should say:

|    "The number of all dynamic negative feedbacks (NACK) sent
      or received in this context, respectively.
      ..."

3b)
  The DESCRIPTION clause for `rohcRtpContextSNACKs', on page 42,
  says:

     "The number of all static negative feedbacks (ACK) sent
      or received in this context, respectively.
      ..."

  It should say:

|    "The number of all static negative feedbacks (STATIC-NACK)
|     sent or received in this context, respectively.
      ..."



Please comment.


Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,

I just picked up and read the new RFC 4009 authored by you,
to find significant concerns with section 2.2. (on pages 3
and 4 of the RFC):


(A)

Unfortunately, within a few lines in the RFC text, the variable
name 'X' gets used for two very distinct purposes and contexts:

  o   X = X0 || X1 || X2 || X3                            (2)
      ... the 32 bit wide input to the function G

  o   X used as formal argument in the defining equations for
      the 'SS-boxes' SS0 ... SS3
      ... a single octet (8 bit wide entity),
          [application of the formulas - see (3) below - will
           substitute X0, ..., X3 in turn for the arguments]

Perhaps, it would have been better to use another symbol,
e.g. 'x', for the latter purpose.


(B)

As far as I can see, feeding the definition of the SS-boxes given
in the last 4 text/formule lines on page 3 into the formula on top
of page 4,

     Z = SS0(X0) ^ SS1(X1) ^ SS2(X2) ^ SS3(X3)            (3)

does ***NOT*** yield the same result as using the primary defining
formulas given for Z0  ... Z3  in the first formula block of
section 2.2., together with

     Z = Z0 || Z1 || Z2 || Z3                             (1).

I suspect a mis-ordering in the use of m0 ... m3 in the
equations defining SS0 ... SS3 :

With regard to the formulas (1), (2), and (3) (as numbered above),
the 'matrix' pattern of the 4x4 terms in braces { ... } , obtained
from the formula block defining SS0 ... SS3 by substitution of Xi
for the argument of SSi (i=0,1,2,3) - as required in (3) -, should
be the matrix transpose of the pattern of the same terms in braces
appearing in the formula block defining Z0 ... Z3 , e. g. the
first 'column' of {...} terms for SSi() should contain the {...}
terms appearing in the formula for Z0.
But this is not the case.

Therefore, I suspect that the last 6 text/formula lines on page 3
of RFC 4009 should in fact read (including the enhancement from (A)
above):

  "
  To increase the efficiency of the G function, four extended S-boxes
  'SS-box' (See Appendix A.2) are defined as follows:

   SS0(x)= {S1(x) & m0} || {S1(x) & m1} || {S1(x) & m2} || {S1(x) & m3}
   SS1(x)= {S2(x) & m1} || {S2(x) & m2} || {S2(x) & m3} || {S2(x) & m0}
   SS2(x)= {S1(x) & m2} || {S1(x) & m3} || {S1(x) & m0} || {S1(x) & m1}
   SS3(x)= {S2(x) & m3} || {S2(x) & m0} || {S2(x) & m1} || {S2(x) & m2}
  "


Please check and comment.


If you agree with my arguments, we should immediately submit an
errata note for these issues to the RFC Editor for publication
on the RFC Errata web page.

In this case, I also recommend to include a textual enhancement
for the first sentence of section 2.3., replacing:

    "The key schedule generates each round subkeys."
by:
    "The key schedule generates subkeys for each round."

And finally, for completeness, it would have been useful as well to
give additional Informational Reference(s) for the seedMAC (and the
[seed]CBC) algorithm(s)/construct(s) mentioned in section 2.5. -
e.g.  RFC 3610 (and RFC 2451 / NIST SP 800-38A) [?].

  Alfred HÎnes.

In several places, RFC2821 referese to "section 2.4.1.".
Unfortunately there *is* no section 2.4.1.  To be quite honest, I'm
really not sure what the intended section number is.  It doesn't
appear obvious to me.

Hi,

FYI -- I happened to be looking at http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2234.txt
and noticed this text on its page 5:

        LINEAR WHITE SPACE:  Concatenation is ...
        ...
        ...
        ...
        ...                          ... to be freelyPand
        implicitlyPinterspersed around ...
        
presumably, each "P" character should be a parenthesis and a space ??

Keith.

I would like to address some inconsistencies in RFC 2184 regarding
parameter values in MIME header. It is two inconsistencies I would like
to point out.

The first one is about at what number should the counting of the
parameter
parts start (0 or 1). A part of page 3 of RFC 2184 reads:

>   are being used to encapsulate a single parameter value.  The count
>   starts at 0 and increments by 1 for each subsequent section of the
>   parameter value.  Decimal values are used and neither leading zeroes
>   nor gaps in the sequence are allowed.
>
>   The original parameter value is recovered by concatenating the
>   various sections of the parameter, in order.  For example, the
>   content-type field
>
>     Content-Type: message/external-body; access-type=URL;
>      URL*0="ftp://";
>      URL*1="cs.utk.edu/pub/moore/bulk-mailer/bulk-mailer.tar"
>

This clearly states that the numbering of the parameter parts should
start
at 0. But further down in the RFC an example is used where the count
starts
with 1. At page 4 of RFC 2184 you can read:

>4.1.  Combining Character Set, Language, and Parameter Continuations
>
>   Character set and language information may be combined with the
>   parameter continuation mechanism. For example:
>
>   Content-Type: application/x-stuff
>    title*1*=us-ascii'en'This%20is%20even%20more%20
>    title*2*=%2A%2A%2Afun%2A%2A%2A%20
>    title*3="isn't it!"

And in section 7 "Modificatons to MIME ABNF" it clearly states that the
counting
shall begin with 1. Note at the end of page 5, intial-section is defined
as:

>   initial-section := "*1"

And on the start of page 6 you have the definition:

>   other-sections := "*" (("2" / "3" / "4" / "5" /
>                           "6" / "7" / "8" / "9") *DIGIT) /
>                          ("1" 1*DIGIT))

If you follow this ABNF, the counting must start at 1 and not 0.


The other thing about RFC 2184 that is clearly wrong, is the change of
the ABNF given in RFC 2047 for encoded-words. RFC 2184 reads:

>   The ABNF given in RFC 2047 for encoded-words is:
>
>   encoded-word := "=?" charset "?" encoding "?" encoded-text "?="
>
>   This specification changes this ABNF to:
>
>   encoded-word := "=?" charset ["*" language] "?" encoded-text "?="

The correct change would have be:

   This specification changes this ABNF to:

   encoded-word := "=?" charset ["*" language] "?" encoding "?"
encoded-text "?="

Dear Sir,


In the section 

14.1. A.1 Coding of wildcards

in RFC3015 Megaco Protocol 1.0

The following statement appears to be gramatically incomplete.
I think a keyword has been missed out. Could you clarify the same 
for me ?

Bits 0 through 5 of the wildcarding field specify the bit position in the
   Termination ID at which the starts.

I feel that some keyword should be present between the and starts.

Please reply at the earliest possible convenience of yours..

Awaiting your reply,

Regards,

Suman Choudhary

Hi there.

I found something strange in rfc1001
Maybe my code is wrong, but it returns "Tge NetBIOS tame"
instead of "The NetBIOS name" when I try to encode
FEGHGFCAEOGFHEECEJEPFDCAHEGBGNGF

"For example, the NetBIOS name "The NetBIOS name" in the NetBIOS scope
"SCOPE.ID.COM" would be represented at level one by the ASCII

character string:

FEGHGFCAEOGFHEECEJEPFDCAHEGBGNGF.SCOPE.ID.COM"

========================================================================

Internet Draft           IP Mobility Support            19 December 2001


   The Lifetime field is chosen as follows:

    -  If the mobile node is registering with a foreign agent, the
       Lifetime SHOULD NOT exceed the value in the Registration Lifetime
       field of the Agent Advertisement message received from the
       foreign agent.  When the method by which the care-of address is
       learned does not include a Lifetime, the default ICMP Router
       Advertisement Lifetime (1800 seconds) MAY be used.

    -  The mobile node MAY ask a home agent to delete a particular
       mobility binding, by sending a Registration Request with the
       care-of address for this binding, with the Lifetime field set to
       zero (Section 3.8.2).

    -  Similarly, a Lifetime of zero is used when the mobile node
       deregisters all care-of addresses, such as upon returning home.

   The Home Address field MUST be set to the mobile node's home address,
   if this information is known.  Otherwise, the Home Address MUST be
   set to zeroes.

   The Home Agent field MUST be set to the address of the mobile node's
   home agent, if the mobile node knows this address.  Otherwise, the
   mobile node MAY use dynamic home agent address resolution to learn
   the address of its home agent.  In this case, the mobile node MUST
   set the Home Agent field to the subnet-directed broadcast address
   of the mobile node's home network.  Each home agent receiving such
   a Registration Request with a broadcast destination address MUST
   reject the mobile node's registration and SHOULD return a rejection
   Registration Reply indicating its unicast IP address for use by the
   mobile node in a future registration attempt.

   The Care-of Address field MUST be set to the value of the particular
   care-of address that the mobile node wishes to (de)register.  In the
   special case in which a mobile node wishes to deregister all care-of
   addresses, it MUST set this field to its home address.

   The mobile node chooses the Identification field in accordance with
   the style of replay protection it uses with its home agent.  This is
   part of the mobility security association the mobile node shares with
   its home agent.  See Section 5.7 for the method by which the mobile
   node computes the Identification field.


3.6.1.3. Extensions

   This section describes the ordering of any mandatory and any optional
   Extensions that a mobile node appends to a Registration Request.
   This following ordering MUST be followed:

(Will the appropriate people please make a note of this for whenever we
turn the crank on 3461 again?)

RFC3461, section 4.2 says:

   The "addr-type" portion MUST be an IANA-registered electronic mail
   address-type (as defined in [3]), while the "xtext" portion contains
   an encoded representation of the original recipient address using the
   rules in section 5 of this document.  The entire ORCPT parameter MAY
   be up to 500 characters in length.

In fact, the encoding rules are in section *4*.  Much hilarity ensued as an MUA
enhancement I was writing failed to escape a '+' because section 5 didn't say
anything about the plus or equals characters, while the section 4 that I didn't
read did say something about escaping them....

Hello,

I've found a few issues with the recently published RFC 3886
authored by you.

According to published policy, a few of these might require consent
by the author(s) to be published on the RFC Editor's "RFC Errata"
web page -- so please confirm if you agree.


(1) RFC 3886, Section 3., 2nd text line on page 3:
    looking into RFC 3887, it seems appropriate to replace:

     "A Message Tracking Status Motification (MTSN) is intended to be
      returned as the body of a Message Tracking request [RFC-MTRK-MTQP]."
                                                 ^^^^^^^
    by:

     "A Message Tracking Status Motification (MTSN) is intended to be
      returned as the body of a Message Tracking response [RFC-MTRK-MTQP]."


(2) RFC 3886, Section 3.1., 2nd text line of major text paragraph, in
    the middle of page 3, change:

         ... "That body consists of one or more "fields" formatted to
      according to" ...
                                                                  ^^^
    by:

         ... "That body consists of one or more "fields" formatted
      according to" ...


(3) RFC 3886, Sections 3.3.5, 3.3.6, and 3.3.7 (on page 7):
    The first line of these sections seem to have inhereted some
    undue editing history inserting the appropriate references;
    the word "Reference" should be removed in every case; therefore

 a) in section 3.3.5 replace:

     "The Remote-MTA field is defined as in section Reference 2.3.5 of
      [RFC-DSN-STAT]." ...
                                                   ^^^^^^^^^^
    by:

     "The Remote-MTA field is defined as in section 2.3.5 of
      [RFC-DSN-STAT]." ...

 b) in section 3.3.6 replace:

     "The Last-Attempt-Date field is defined as in section Reference 2.3.7
      of [RFC-DSN-STAT]." ...
                                                          ^^^^^^^^^^
    by:

     "The Last-Attempt-Date field is defined as in section 2.3.7 of
      [RFC-DSN-STAT]." ...

 c) in section 3.3.7 replace:

     "The Will-Retry-Until field is defined as in section Reference 2.3.9
      of [RFC-DSN-STAT]." ...
                                                   ^^^^^^^^^^
    by:

     "The Will-Retry-Until field is defined as in section 2.3.9 of
      [RFC-DSN-STAT]." ...


(4) The text of RFC 3886, Section 5. (on page 8) appears to by copied
    unchanged from RFC 3885 and thus does not fit the context of
    RFC 3885. It should be changed from:

     "IANA has registered the SMTP extension defined in section 3."
                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    to:

     "IANA has registered the MIME subtype defined in section 3."

    (or similarly).


Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,

I've found two typos in the recently published RFC 3887 :


o  The bottom of page 11 (in section 5.),

                                                    ... "All optional text
     provided with the COMMENT command are ignored."
                                       ^^^
   should probably read:

                                                    ... "All optional text
     provided with the COMMENT command is ignored."


o  Similarly, in the 3rd paragraph of section 11. (middle of page 17),
   replace:

           ... "Thus, if an MTQP client/server pair decide to use TLS
     confidentially," ...
                                                         ^^
   by:

           ... "Thus, if an MTQP client/server pair decides to use TLS
     confidentially," ...


RFC-Editor: According to published policy, please include these
remarks in the 'RFC Errata' web page.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,

triggered by the recent RFC 3886, I have re-visited RFC 3798 and found
a serious general issue with that document:

The 'Changes from RFC 2298' -- as listed in Appendix A on page 29 of
RFC 3798 -- in fact have NOT been applied consistently to this document.

As a result, the textual description of actions throughout RFC 3398
often remains in contradiction to the new, restricted MDN grammar!

Details:


(1) disposition types
=====================

Appendix A says:

  The dispositions "denied" and "failed" were removed from the
  document reflecting the lack of implementation or usage ...


Now, the syntax production "disposition-type" in section 3.2.6. (on
page 14) and section 7. (on mid-page 22) has been changed to read:

    disposition-type = "displayed" / "deleted"

This means that the RFC 2298 disposition types "dispatched" and
"processed" have been removed from the syntax definitions as well!

Thus, either Appendix A lacks mentioning these removals  OR  these
items should not have been removed from the syntax definitions.

Nevertheless, all these disposition types removed from the syntax are
mentioned at many places througout RFC 3798:

o  "dispatched" :

   - section 3.2.6. , final paragraph of the section on page 16
   - section 4. , third-to-last bullet on page 17
   - section 4. , first bullet on page 18

o  "processed" :

   - section 4. , third-to-last bullet on page 17
   - section 4. , first bullet on page 18
   - section 5. , 4th paragraph on page 18

o  "denied" :

   - section 2.1. , bottom of page 4
   - section 2.1. , end of 3rd paragraph on page 5
   - section 4. , third-to-last bullet on page 17
   - section 4. , first bullet on page 18
   - section 6.2. , end of first paragraph on page 19

o  "failed" :

   - section 2.2. , middle of second-to-last paragraph on page 6
   - section 2.2. , middle of second paragraph on page 7 (twice)
   - section 2.2. , third paragraph on page 7 (twice)
   - section 3.2.7. , in 2nd text line, on page 16
                    (mis-spelled "failure" there)
   - section 4. , third-to-last bullet on page 17
   - section 4. , first bullet on page 18

All these places in the text deal with the issue/sending/generation
of MDNs with the named deprecated disposition types (it would be
acceptable to talk about what to do with *received* such disposition
types for backwards compatibility with RFC 2298) !


(2) disposition modifiers
=========================

Appendix A says:

  The disposition modifiers "warning", "superseded", "expired",
  "mailbox-terminated" have not seen actual implementation. They have
  been deleted from this document.


Accordingly, the syntax production "disposition-type" in section 3.2.6.
(on page 14) and section 7. (on mid-page 22) has been changed to read:

    disposition-modifier = "error" / disposition-modifier-extension

Nevertheless, one of these 'removed' modifiers disposition is
mentioned in the text of RFC 3798:

o  "warning" :

   - section 3.2.7. , 3rd line of text on page 16


These inconsistencies urgently need clarification!

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Adrian,

  I think we should fix this. I'm cc'ing the RFC Editor guys.
  Let's see what they say.
  Thanks for looking at this.

Dear RFC Editor:

Section 4 of RFC 3770 contains a significant error.  There is a 
typographical error in the object identifier.  Please publish this errata 
as soon as possible.

    The WLAN SSID attribute certificate attribute is identified by
    id-aca-wlanSSID.

      id-aca  OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=  { iso(1) identified-organization(3)

RfC 2069 (digest access authentication) chapter 2.4 is an example,
the userame is "Mufasa", the password is "CircleOfLife":

| username="Mufasa",
| realm="testrealm@host.com",
| nonce="dcd98b7102dd2f0e8b11d0f600bfb0c093",
| uri="/dir/index.html",
| response="e966c932a9242554e42c8ee200cec7f6",
| opaque="5ccc069c403ebaf9f0171e9517f40e41"

The "respose" is MD5( MD5( A1 ) || ':' || nonce || ':' || MD5( A2 ))

MD5( A1 ) = MD5( username || ':' || realm || ':' || password )
          = MD5( "Mufasa:testrealm@host.com:CircleOfLife" )
          = "4945ecf42b1bb868634058a845bedde8"

MD5( A2 ) = MD5( Method || ':' || digest-uri-value )
          = MD5( "GET:/dir/index.html" )
          = "39aff3a2bab6126f332b942af96d3366"

This results in a response = "1949323746fe6a43ef61f9606e7febea"
instead of the shown value = "e966c932a9242554e42c8ee200cec7f6".

Quick reality check, the RfC 2617 example uses the same values
    username = "Mufasa"
    nonce    = "dcd98b7102dd2f0e8b11d0f600bfb0c093"
    realm    = "testrealm@host.com"
    A2       = "GET:/dir/index.html"
with a slightly different
    password = "Circle Of Life"
resulting in MD5( A1 ) = "939e7578ed9e3c518a452acee763bce9"

The "respose" is MD5( MD5( A1 ) || ':' || X || ':' || MD5( A2 ))
for X = "dcd98b7102dd2f0e8b11d0f600bfb0c093:00000001:0a4f113b:auth"
and here the response = "6629fae49393a05397450978507c4ef1" works as
expected.

I've tried to contact two of the RfC 2069 authors about this issue,
but got no reply.

Hello,

I'm reporting what I believe are typos in RFC 3031, MPLS Architecture.

On page 9, in the acronyms and abbreviations section, following the
'L2' description is the 'L3' acronym and description on the same line.
Apparently there is a missing CR/LF.

On page 21, under 3.20 Aggregation, first paragraph, 3rd sentence there
is this:

  "...swapping might be used only to get the the traffic to the egress
  node."

Notice the double 'the'.

Hello,
having read the recent RFC 4073 authored by you I suspect a small
but perhaps technically important flaw in the text that finally
turned out to be a more general issue:

In the module heading and in the IMPORTS clause of the ASN.1 module
of RFC 4073 (Appendix A on page 7), the textual label for the
sub-identifier 9 of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER 1.2.840.113549.1 is
spelled "pkcs-9(9)".
But, ALL other (#=4) appearances of this same sub-identifier in the
text of RFC 4073 use the spelling "pkcs9(9)" (without the '-').

I've tried to resolve this inconsistency going "back to the roots",
and unfortunately found a big mess! (see detailed list below)

Basically, PKCS#9 v2.0 from RSA Labs and its ASCII-fication RFC 2985
should be considered the primary reference because this spec contains
the definition of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER 1.2.840.113549.1.9 .
There, the spelling consistently is  "pkcs-9(9)" .

This notation style is strictly followed in all PKCS publications
from RSA (as far as I could verify), and in most RFCs related to
PKCS/CMS/PKIX. I've found 24 RFCs of this kind.

But there are two RFCs using the spelling "pkcs9(9)" (without the '-')
exlusively.

And finally, I found 8 RFCs - including RFC 4073 and your RFC 4049,
as well - using both spellings mixed without any recognizable pattern.

Here are the detailed results of my RFC scan - with shortened titles,
and some content oriented grouping applied:

'pkcs-9(9)' only :
----------------
  2985 - PKCS #9

  2311 - S/MIME v.2 Message Specification,
  2312 - S/MIME v.2 Certificate Handling,
  2633 - S/MIME v.3 Message Specification
  3114 - Company Classifying Policy via S/MIME Security Label
  3183 - Domain Security Services using S/MIME
  3850 - S/MIME v.3.1 Certificate Handling
  3855 - Transporting S/MIME Objects in X.400

  2459 - PKIX Certificate and CRL Profile  [ obsoleted by: 3280 ]
  3280 - PKIX Certificate and CRL Profile

  2511 - PKIX Certificate Request Messages
  3029 - PKIX Data Validation and Certification Server Protocols

  2797 - Certificate Mgmt Messages over CMS
  3161 - PKIX Time-Stamp Protocol

  3125 - Electronic Signature Policies

  3211 - Password-based Encryption for CMS  [ obsoleted by: 3369+3370 ]
  3274 - Compressed Data Content for CMS

  2875 - D-H Proof-of-Posession
  3185 - Reuse of CMS CEKs
  3217 - Triple-DES and RC2 Key Wrapping
  3370 - CMS Algorithms
  3537 - HMAC Key Wrapping with 3DES or AES
  3560 - RSAES-OAEP Key Transport in CMS
  3565 - Use of AES Encryption in CMS

'pkcs9(9)' only :
---------------
  3657 - Use of Camellia Encryption in CMS
  4010 - Use of SEED Encryption in CMS

mixed spelling :
--------------
  2630 - CMS  [ obsoleted by: 3369+3370 ]
  3369 - CMS  [ obsoleted by: 3852 ]
  3852 - CMS

  2634 - Enhanced Security Services for S/MIME
  3851 - S/MIME v.3.1 Message Specification

  3126 - Electronic Signature Formats for lon-term signatures

  4049 - BinaryTime

  4073 - Multiple Content in CMS

Note: I fear that there might exist similar inconsistencies for other
====  object identifiers (verification: t.b.d.)


So, what should be done?
It certainly would be VERY preferrable to follow identifier naming
literally, always and strictly, once published in a normatively
referrable way.
At least, we should ensure a consistent use of already defined
identifiers to be followed in future IETF publications.
Additionally, it might be considered to post Errata Notes for some
(or all non-obsoleted) RFCs in the 2nd and 3rd category above
(i.e., RFCs 2634, 3126, 3657, 3851, 3852, 4010, 4049, 4073).

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Thanks for reporting the typo.  It should not be a problem in 
practice.  "pkcs9" and "pkcs-9" will simpley be treated as synonyms for the 
integer value 9.

Hi,

Attributes that should be included in Tunnel-Stop and Tunnel-Link-Stop include attribute Acct-Multi-Session-Id with code 51. 
Acct-Multi-Session-Id has an associated code of 50 in RFC 2866. Is it therefore an error in RFC 2867 ?

Regards,

Unai.

While not technically a MIB module and possibly of no interest to anyone given 
the SMIng working group (and I'm pretty sure the mailing list) shut down, 
unless it restarts some day, this is probably the most appropriate place to 
mention this too, short of the snmpv3 list.  (I'll forward this and the other 
two MPLS MIB errata emails to the RFC editor as well.)

There are ASN.1 syntax errors on all but one of the type definitions defined in

Hello,

reading the recently published RFC 3970 authored by you
I found some unfortunate textual issues on page 16:

The DESCRIPTION clauses of
    -  teTunnelOctects and teTunnelLPOctects
    -  teTunnelPackets and teTunnelLPPackets
are pairwise identical, respectively.

There is no precise description of the precise meaning of
these  "teTunnelLPxxx"  objects.
Admittedly, one might guess from the SYNTAX clauses of these
objects that "LP" stands for 'lower part' -- meaning that the
value of a "teTunnelLPOctets" object should always equal the
value of the corresponding "teTunnelOctets" object MODULO 2^32
(and similarly for the "...Packets" objects), but this is not
stated in the text.

Furthermore, unfortunately the naming of these objects does
not conform to the conventional naming style used in (almost)
all IETF standards track MIB modules with High Capacity
counters, e. g.  "xxxOctets"  and  "xxxHCOctets" .
The above interpretation would be more manifest if this
standard naming convention would have been followed.

Now, given that the naming of the objects cannot be changed
any more, it would certainly be useful to have a textual
clarification of these DESCRIPTIONs posted on the RFC Editor's
RFC-Errata web page.

Please comment.

Best Regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello again,
and thanks for your quick response.

Meanwhile, I've tried to figure out in detail what's wrong with
the formulas for SSi by applying my version and your version to
a few examples (calculated by hand).

In the course of this effort, again going through the text, I have
detected additional issues with the RFC text.


[ I continue the enumeration from my first mail. ]

(C)

First, a formal issue with the ASN.1 given in the RFC text:

In the ASN.1 definitions in section 2.5., it would perhaps be more
natural and consistent with the requirements from the text (and the
ASN.1 comment already present there!) to give an explicit SIZE
restriction in the definition of the syntax of the initialization
vector for SEED in CBC mode (which indeed *MUST* be 16 octets long).
To this end, I recommend to replace the 7th text line of section 2.5.,

  "seedCDCParameter ::= OCTET STRING  -- 128-bit Initialization Vector"

by:

| "seedCDCParameter ::= OCTET STRING (SIZE(16))
|                       -- 128-bit Initialization Vector"


(D)

The text in section 2.2. talks about two basic 8x8 S-boxes, named
"S1" and "S2".  Contrary to that, Appendix A.1. (on page 7) gives
tables for "S-Box S0" and "S-Box S1".

It would be easier to change the headlines in Appendix A.1.,
but, given the numbering style of all other formula elements,
it is certainly be more appropriate and consistent to modify the
equations in section 2.2., replacing "S1" by "S0", and "S2" by "S1".

I'll give a full replacement text for section 2.2. below, covering
this issue as well.


[ Now, returning to the open issue ... ]
(B)

In short, sorry, I do NOT agree with your definition of the SS-boxes.
It does not conform with the primary definition of the function G.

Below, I'll give you a detailed step-by-step explanation, using a
concrete example, for the reasoning already presented in my first
mail.

Note: For brevity and due to the email line length restriction,
  in the subsequent reasoning, I will omit the braces '{ ... }'
  around the ANDed terms, making use of the usual precedence rule
  for multiplication over addition and the facts that
  - the '^' operation is the normal addition in the 8 / 32 dimensional
    vector spaces over GF(2) we are working on,
  - '&' representing the 8 / 32 fold tensor product of the scalar
    multiplication over GF(2) .

I repeat and extend the numeration of the formulas from my first
email, already applying item (D).

   X = X0 || X1 || X2 || X3                                       (2)

       ... the 32 bit wide input to the function G;

   Z = Z0 || Z1 || Z2 || Z3                                       (1)

       ... the 32 bit wide output of the function G applied to X;
           with the 8-bit wide components computed by the application
           of the two S-Boxes S0 and S1 via the equations:

   Z0 = S0(X0) & m0 ^ S1(X1) & m1 ^ S0(X2) & m2 ^ S1(X3) & m3     (1.0)
   Z1 = S0(X0) & m1 ^ S1(X1) & m2 ^ S0(X2) & m3 ^ S1(X3) & m0     (1.1)
   Z2 = S0(X0) & m2 ^ S1(X1) & m3 ^ S0(X2) & m0 ^ S1(X3) & m1     (1.2)
   Z3 = S0(X0) & m3 ^ S1(X1) & m0 ^ S0(X2) & m1 ^ S1(X3) & m2     (1.3)

    with    m0 = 0xFC , m1 = 0xF3 , m2 = 0xCF , and m3 = 0x3F     (1.4)


The alternate description of the Function G is to be

   Z = SS0(X0) ^ SS1(X1) ^ SS2(X2) ^ SS3(X3)                      (3)

where, below, I'll try "my" version of the SS-Box definition ...

   SS0(x) = S0(x) & m0 || S0(x) & m1 || S0(x) & m2 || S0(x) & m3  (4.0)
   SS1(x) = S1(x) & m1 || S1(x) & m2 || S1(x) & m3 || S1(x) & m0  (4.1)
   SS2(x) = S0(x) & m2 || S0(x) & m3 || S0(x) & m0 || S0(x) & m1  (4.2)
   SS3(x) = S1(x) & m3 || S1(x) & m0 || S1(x) & m1 || S1(x) & m2  (4.3)

... and the version from the text (with the formal changes already
    discussed properly applied) ...

   SS0(x) = S0(x) & m3 || S0(x) & m2 || S0(x) & m1 || S0(x) & m0  (5.0)
   SS1(x) = S1(x) & m0 || S1(x) & m3 || S1(x) & m2 || S1(x) & m1  (5.1)
   SS2(x) = S0(x) & m1 || S0(x) & m0 || S0(x) & m3 || S0(x) & m2  (5.2)
   SS3(x) = S1(x) & m2 || S1(x) & m1 || S1(x) & m0 || S1(x) & m3  (5.3)


With these notations, let's challenge the example octet sequence

   X0 = 0x09 , X1 = 0x11 , X2 = 0xE1 , X3 = 0xF9                  (6a)

i.e., by (2) :      X = (0x) 09 11 E1 F9                          (6b)

Applying the tables from Appendix A.1., we obtain  (*)  :

   S0(X0) = 0x43 ,
   S1(X1) = 0x62 ,
   S0(X2) = 0xB9 ,
   S1(X3) = 0x4C .


To first compute Z with the original definition of G, substituting
(*) and (1.4) into (1.0) .. (1.3), we obtain, step by step:

   Z0 = S0(X0) & m0 ^ S1(X1) & m1 ^ S0(X2) & m2 ^ S1(X3) & m3     (1.0)
      = 0x43 & 0xFC ^ 0x62 & 0xF3 ^ 0xB9 & 0xCF ^ 0x4C & 0x3F
      =     0x40    ^     0x62    ^     0x89    ^     0x0C
==>
   Z0 = 0xA7                                                      (7.0)

   Z1 = S0(X0) & m1 ^ S1(X1) & m2 ^ S0(X2) & m3 ^ S1(X3) & m0     (1.1)
      = 0x43 & 0xF3 ^ 0x62 & 0xCF ^ 0xB9 & 0x3F ^ 0x4C & 0xFC
      =     0x43    ^     0x42    ^     0x39    ^     0x4C
==>
   Z1 = 0x74                                                      (7.1)

   Z2 = S0(X0) & m2 ^ S1(X1) & m3 ^ S0(X2) & m0 ^ S1(X3) & m1     (1.2)
      = 0x43 & 0xCF ^ 0x62 & 0x3F ^ 0xB9 & 0xFC ^ 0x4C & 0xF3
      =     0x43    ^     0x22    ^     0xB8    ^     0x40
==>
   Z2 = 0x99                                                      (7.2)

   Z3 = S0(X0) & m3 ^ S1(X1) & m0 ^ S0(X2) & m1 ^ S1(X3) & m2     (1.3)
      = 0x43 & 0x3F ^ 0x62 & 0xFC ^ 0xB9 & 0xF3 ^ 0x4C & 0xCF
      =     0x03    ^     0x60    ^     0xB1    ^     0x4C
==>
   Z3 = 0x9E                                                      (7.3)

Putting (7.0) .. (7.3) together using (1), we get the byte sequence

   Z = Z0 || Z1 || Z2 || Z3                                       (1)
==>
   Z = (0x) A7 74 99 9E                                           (7)


Now let's see what happens when we apply "my" definition of the
SS-Boxes, substituting (6a), (*), and (1.4) into (4.0) .. (4.3) :

   SS0(X0) = S0(X0) & m0 || S0(X0) & m1 || S0(X0) & m2 || S0(X0) & m3
           = 0x43 & 0xFC || 0x43 & 0xF3 || 0x43 & 0xCF || 0x43 & 0x3F
           =     0x40    ||     0x43    ||     0x43    ||     0x03
==>
   SS0(X0) = (0x) 40 43 43 03                                     (8.0)

   SS1(X1) = S1(X1) & m1 || S1(X1) & m2 || S1(X1) & m3 || S1(X1) & m0
           = 0x62 & 0xF3 || 0x62 & 0xCF || 0x62 & 0x3F || 0x62 & 0xFC
           =     0x62    ||     0x42    ||     0x22    ||     0x60
==>
   SS1(X1) = (0x) 62 42 22 60                                     (8.1)

   SS2(X2) = S0(X2) & m2 || S0(X2) & m3 || S0(X2) & m0 || S0(X2) & m1
           = 0xB9 & 0xCF || 0xB9 & 0x3F || 0xB9 & 0xFC || 0xB9 & 0xF3
           =     0x89    ||     0x39    ||     0xB8    ||     0xB1
==>
   SS2(X2) = (0x) 89 39 B8 B1                                     (8.2)

   SS3(X3) = S1(X3) & m3 || S1(X3) & m0 || S1(X3) & m1 || S1(X3) & m2
           = 0x4C & 0x3F || 0x4C & 0xFC || 0x4C & 0xF3 || 0x4C & 0xCF
           =     0x0C    ||     0x4C    ||     0x40    ||     0x4C
==>
   SS3(X3) = (0x) 0C 4C 40 4C                                     (8.3)

Note: Please observe that the terms in (8.0) .. (8.3) are indeed
  the same terms as in (7.0) .. (7.3), but in 4x4 matrix transposed
  order -- as stated abstractly in my first email.

Summing up (8.0) .. (8.3) according to (3), we get what should be
the alternate definition of G(X) :

   Z = SS0(X0) ^ SS1(X1) ^ SS2(X2) ^ SS3(X3)                      (3)
     = (0x) 40 43 43 03  ^                         --  from (8.0)
       (0x) 62 42 22 60  ^                         --  from (8.1)
       (0x) 89 39 B8 B1  ^                         --  from (8.2)
       (0x) 0C 4C 40 4C                            --  from (8.3)
==>         -----------
   Z = (0x) A7 74 99 9E                                           (8)

Obviously, (8) indeed is identical to (7).


Finally, let's look for what we get with your definition of the
SS-Boxes, substituting (6a), (*), and (1.4) into (5.0) .. (5.3) :

   SS0(X0) = S0(X0) & m3 || S0(X0) & m2 || S0(X0) & m1 || S0(X0) & m0
           = 0x43 & 0x3F || 0x43 & 0xCF || 0x43 & 0xF3 || 0x43 & 0xFC
           =     0x03    ||     0x43    ||     0x43    ||     0x40
==>
   SS0(X0) = (0x) 03 43 43 40                                     (9.0)

   SS1(X1) = S1(X1) & m0 || S1(X1) & m3 || S1(X1) & m2 || S1(X1) & m1
           = 0x62 & 0xFC || 0x62 & 0x3F || 0x62 & 0xCF || 0x62 & 0xF3
           =     0x60    ||     0x22    ||     0x42    ||     0x62
==>
   SS1(X1) = (0x) 60 22 42 62                                     (9.1)

   SS2(X2) = S0(X2) & m1 || S0(X2) & m0 || S0(X2) & m3 || S0(X2) & m2
           = 0xB9 & 0xF3 || 0xB9 & 0xFC || 0xB9 & 0x3F || 0xB9 & 0xCF
           =     0xB1    ||     0xB8    ||     0x39    ||     0x89
==>
   SS2(X2) = (0x) B1 B8 39 89                                     (9.2)

   SS3(X3) = S1(X3) & m2 || S1(X3) & m1 || S1(X3) & m0 || S1(X3) & m3
           = 0x4C & 0xCF || 0x4C & 0xF3 || 0x4C & 0xFC || 0x4C & 0x3F
           =     0x4C    ||     0x40    ||     0x4C    ||     0x0C
==>
   SS3(X3) = (0x) 4C 40 4C 0C                                     (8.3)

Summing up (9.0) .. (9.3) according to (3), we get

   Z = SS0(X0) ^ SS1(X1) ^ SS2(X2) ^ SS3(X3)                      (3)
     = (0x) 03 43 43 40  ^                         --  from (9.0)
       (0x) 60 22 42 62  ^                         --  from (9.1)
       (0x) B1 B8 39 89  ^                         --  from (9.2)
       (0x) 4C 40 4C 0C                            --  from (9.3)
==>         -----------
   Z = (0x) 9E 99 74 A7                                           (9)

This is NOT the same as (7).


In fact, it is the byte-reversed sequence from (7) .

-- Bingo!
Taking a closer look at (5.0) .. (5.3), I now see that indeed the
terms in these equations are in the reverse concatenation sequence
compared to (4.0) .. (4.3) !

After a detailed inspection of the tables given in Appendix A.2.
of RFC 4009, it now becomes clear that -- disregarding the IETF
conventions to represent all binary data in network byte order,
and without any further notice of this fact -- these tables do NOT
represent octect sequences (as expected from the presentation of
above formula using octet concatenation, not arithmetic left-shift
or multiply-by-256 operations), BUT the hexadecimal representation
of the proper 4-octet sequences improperly cast into 32 bit numbers
on a 'little endian' processor, i.e., without using the ntohl()
intrinsic!

I suspect that your definition of the SS-boxes (5.0) .. (5.3) has
been inadvertently retrofitted to match the values given in the
tables in Appendix A.2., again re-formulating the printed byte
order (which is NOT the storage byte order [= octet concatenation
order] in a little endian processor) using the octet concatenation
notation / formalism.

Because definition of the function G according to section 2.2. does
not make use of 32-bit integer arithmetic operations, I recommend
to clarify the situation by
o   giving formula (4.0) .. (4.3) for the SS-Boxes, consistent
    with the other formulas, and
o   stating explicitely in Appendix A.2. that these tables give
    byte reversed presentations of the octet sequences to be
    used as the output of the SS-boxes.


To catch up, here's my proposed replacement text for the whole
section 2.2. of RFC 4009, covering the issues (A), (B), and (D)
mentioned so far:

---------------- cut here -------------------------------

2.2.  The Function G

   The function G has two layers: a layer of two 8x8 S-boxes, S0 and
   S1, and a layer of block permutation of sixteen 8-bit sub-blocks.
   The output octet sequence Z (= Z0 || Z1 || Z2 || Z3) of the
   function G with the four-octet input X (= X0 || X1 || X2 || X3)
   is as follows:

    Z0 = {S0(X0) & m0} ^ {S1(X1) & m1} ^ {S0(X2) & m2} ^ {S1(X3) & m3}
    Z1 = {S0(X0) & m1} ^ {S1(X1) & m2} ^ {S0(X2) & m3} ^ {S1(X3) & m0}
    Z2 = {S0(X0) & m2} ^ {S1(X1) & m3} ^ {S0(X2) & m0} ^ {S1(X3) & m1}
    Z3 = {S0(X0) & m3} ^ {S1(X1) & m0} ^ {S0(X2) & m1} ^ {S1(X3) & m2}

   where  m0 = 0xFC , m1 = 0xF3 , m2 = 0xCF , and m3 = 0x3F .

   To increase the efficiency of the calculation of the function G, four
   extended S-boxes with 4-octet output ('SS-boxes', see Appendix A.2.)
   are defined as follows:

    SS0(x) = {S0(x) & m0} || {S0(x) & m1} || {S0(x) & m2} || {S0(x) & m3}
    SS1(x) = {S1(x) & m1} || {S1(x) & m2} || {S1(x) & m3} || {S1(x) & m0}
    SS2(x) = {S0(x) & m2} || {S0(x) & m3} || {S0(x) & m0} || {S0(x) & m1}
    SS3(x) = {S1(x) & m3} || {S1(x) & m0} || {S1(x) & m1} || {S1(x) & m2}

   Hereby, the function G can be defined as follows:

      Z = G(X) = SS0(X0) ^ SS1(X1) ^ SS2(X2) ^ SS3(X3)  .

   This alternate definition of the function G is faster than the
   original definition but it takes 16 times the memory to store
   the four SS-boxes compared to the two original S-boxes.

---------------- cut here -------------------------------


Immediately below the headline of Appendix A.2., on page 8,
I propose to insert the following text (or similar):

   "The following tables specify the byte-reversed SS-box values,
    i.e., the first octet to be returned from the function G
    (named Z0 in section 2.2.), is obtained by XORing together
    the rightmost bytes from the appropriate entries looked up
    in the following four tables, etc."


(E)

The above discussion, and the observed deviation from the IETF
standard ('network') byte ordering convention, immediately raises
additional byte ordering concerns for
-  the definition of the round function F in section 2.1., and
-  the Key Schedule definition given in section 2.3.

The function G -- as defined in section 2.2. -- operates on a four-
octet sequence and returns a four-octet sequence, according to the
formulae labelled (1) and (2) above.

The definition of the round function F and the key schedule make use of
several multi-byte INTEGER arithmetic operations, in particular 32-bit
(mod 2^32) addition and subtraction, on input and output values of the
function G, and the key schedule uses circular shift operations on
concatenated (64 bit) intermediate key blocks.

With regard to the observations made above, I now suspect that some
of the implicit 'cast' operations (between octet sequences and multi-
byte integers) involved in the round functions and the key schedule
might also be formulated in a little-endian centric way, omitting the
necessary application of the htonl() and ntohl() intrinsics when
producing the test cases in Appendix B.  (I did not have the time
to verify that.)

For the sake of interoperability, it SHOULD be clarified whether the
formulae given for R0' and R1' in section 2.1., and for Ki0 and Ki1
in section 2.3., as well as the constant's values tabulated in the
latter section, are specified according to IEFT standard byte ordering
rules, or with implicit little-endian byte order in mind.



Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

There are two errors in the SDP examples shown in RFC 3189:

1. In an fmtp paramter, there should not be a space after the colon.

2. The examples show the use of two fmtp parameters for a single
   payload type.  This was not necessary since they can be combined.
   In draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-new-24.txt, section 6, the rules of RFC
   2327 are clarified to say that only one fmtp parameter is allowed
   per payload type.  Therefore, the examples should be reformatted to
   use a single line.

There are two places in the RFC where these errors appear.

In Section 3.1, the RFC says:

      a=fmtp:113 encode=SD-VCR/525-60
      a=fmtp:113 audio=none

It should say:

      a=fmtp:113 encode=SD-VCR/525-60 audio=none

In Section 3.2, the RFC says:

      a=fmtp: 112 encode=SD-VCR/525-60
      a=fmtp: 112 audio=bundled
      a=fmtp: 113 encode=306M/525-60
      a=fmtp: 113 audio=bundled

It should say:

      a=fmtp:112 encode=SD-VCR/525-60 audio=bundled
      a=fmtp:113 encode=306M/525-60 audio=bundled

Hello,

in the new RFC 4113 edited by you I found two texual issues
in DESCRIPTION clauses of the MIB module that both look like
the result of re-use of text from other places with the due
changes applied incompletely to the copied text.

(1) The DESCRIPTION clause of 'udpEndpointRemoteAddressType',
    at the bottom of page 10,

      "The address type of udpEndpointRemoteAddress.  Only
       IPv4, IPv4z, IPv6, and IPv6z addresses are expected, or
       unknown(0) if datagrams for all remote IP addresses are
       accepted. ..."
                               ^^^
    (borrowed from 'udpEndpointLocalAddressType' DESCRIPTION)
    probably should read:

      "The address type of udpEndpointRemoteAddress.  Only
       IPv4, IPv4z, IPv6, and IPv6z addresses are expected, or
       unknown(0) if datagrams from all remote IP addresses are
       accepted. ..."
                               ^^^^

(2) The DESCRIPTION clause of 'udpEndpointRemotePort', on page 11
    says (borrowed from 'udpEndpointRemoteAddress' DESCRIPTION):

      "The remote port number for this UDP endpoint.  If
       datagrams from any remote system are to be accepted,
       this value is zero."
                                 ^^^^^^
    It should say:

      "The remote port number for this UDP endpoint.  If
       datagrams from any remote port are to be accepted,
       this value is zero."
                                 ^^^^


If you agree, I propose to submit an RFC Errata Note to the
RFC Editor.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,

Once you have written RFC 2288 that defined three URN namespaces:
  ISSN, ISBN, and SICI.
The IANA "urn-namespaces" registry does not (and probably never
did) contain any pointers to RFC 2288.

Meanwhile, the 'ISSN' URN namespace definition has been restated
in RFC 3044, including an IANA registration -- according to and
using the template specified in RFC 2611 (BCP 33) [that in the
meantime has been obsoleted itself by RFC 3406 (BCP 66)] --,
and 'ISSN' currently appears as formal URN namespace #3 in the
IANA URN namespaces registry.

Similarly, the 'ISBN' URN namespace definition has been restated
in RFC 3187, including an IANA registration -- according to and
using the template specified in RFC 2611 --, and 'ISBN' currently
appears as formal URN namespace #9 in the IANA registry.

Now, RFC 2288 is *NOT* declared "Obsoleted" in the RFC index.
Contrary to that, the 'SICI' URN namespace does *NOT* appear
in the current IANA URN namespaces registry.
Thus the fate of the 'SICI' namespace and the status of RFC 2288
is questionable and unclear.

I suspect that RFC 2288 should be considered obsoleted, and
'SICI' should be considered deprecated.

So, what's to do in this case ?

According to my understanding of the established procedures,
the Informational RFC 2288 cannot easily be re-classified as
Historic, and a specific footnote about the deprecated 'SICI'
namespace would not be easily entered into the IANA registry.
Therefore, to make the situation clearly understandable for
everyone, it seems easiest to have the RFC-Ed add the note
   '(Obsoleted by 3044, RFC 3187)'
to the RFC index entry for RFC 2288.

Please comment.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,

after reading the recently published RFC 4140 (HMIPv6) authored
by you, I'd like to submit some comments.

These might be useful for you in proparation of any future
update (promotion onto the Standards Track) of HMIPv6 and/or
consideration for an RFC Errata note -- at your will.

1.)  There are a couple of issues with the citiations given
     in Appendix A, on pp. 24-27 :

1.1) I suspect that the repeated occourrences of "[5]" should
     in fact be "[4]" (the Fast Handover RFC 4068).

1.2) The final phrase at the bottom of page 26 should obviously
     refer to RFC 4067 (CXTP) instead of a "work in progress"
     (add appropriate ref to section 14.2.!)

1.3) The citations "[6]" on page 27 apparently make no sense --
     SEND does not update RFC 4068.  I suspect a reference to
     some "work in progress" would have been appropriate.

2.)  Minor typos and proposed textual improvements

2.1) On p.8, in line 5 (i.e. the end of section 4.1.):
     instead of "introduced in future" the text might perhaps
     better say: "introduced in the future".

2.2) On p. 14, in the bottom line (at the end of section 7.1.),
     the final "." is missing.

2.3) On p. 16, in the 2nd-to-last paragraph of section 7.2.,
     The phrase "RCoA is then bound to ..." should perhaps better
     say: "The RCoA is then bound to ...".

2.4) On page 19, in the final line of section 9.2., the word
     "movement" is mis-spelled "u0movement".

2.5) On page 20, in the enumerated list at the end of section 12.,
     I propose to remove the "The" in all 3 items, aligning with
     the titles of the subsequent sections 12.1. - 12.3.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hi,

In section 3.3 of RFC-2250

	  Payload Type: Distinct payload types should be assigned
          for video elementary streams and audio elementary streams.
          See [4] for payload type assignments.

        M bit:  For video, set to 1 on packet containing MPEG frame
          end code, 0 otherwise.  For audio, set to 1 on first packet of
          a "talk-spurt," 0 otherwise.

        PT:  MPEG video or audio stream ID.

Payload Type and PT mean the same in RTP header
So, there exists a repetition.

regards
Vishal

Hello,

in the recently published RFC 4133, a reference to another new
RFC, (RFC 4152), unfortunately has been left in a boilerplate
like form 'RFCYYYY' at 4 places within the text.

I suggest to emit an errata note for RFC 4133 including the
appropriate corrections:


(1)

In the bottom half of page 10, the RFC text says:

     For example, the entPhysicalUris object may be used to encode a URI
     containing a Common Language Equipment Identifier (CLEI) URN for
     the managed physical entity.  The URN name space for CLEIs is
     defined in [RFCYYYY], and the CLEI format is defined in
     [T1.213][T1.213a].  For example, an entPhysicalUris instance may
     have the value of

        URN:CLEI:D4CE18B7AA

     [RFC3986] and [RFCYYYY] identify this as a URI in the CLEI URN name
     space.  The specific CLEI code, D4CE18B7AA, is based on the example
     provided in [T1.213a].

It should say:

     For example, the entPhysicalUris object may be used to encode a URI
     containing a Common Language Equipment Identifier (CLEI) URN for
     the managed physical entity.  The URN name space for CLEIs is
     defined in [RFC4152], and the CLEI format is defined in
     [T1.213][T1.213a].  For example, an entPhysicalUris instance may
     have the value of

        URN:CLEI:D4CE18B7AA

     [RFC3986] and [RFC4152] identify this as a URI in the CLEI URN name
     space.  The specific CLEI code, D4CE18B7AA, is based on the example
     provided in [T1.213a].


(2)

In the 3rd-to-last item of section 8.2., on page 60, the text says:

   [RFCYYYY]     Tesink, K. and R. Fox, "A Uniform Resource Name (URN)
                 Namespace for the CLEI Code", RFC YYYY, August 2005.

In addition to the above, I have noticed the following formatting
error in the first bullet in Section 4.6.1.1 on p. 14.  The text
in the RFC looks like this:

   - For integer-valued enumerations:

     - INTEGER is REQUIRED; - Integer32, Unsigned32, and Gauge32 MUST
     NOT be used.

and it should look like this:

   - For integer-valued enumerations:

     - INTEGER is REQUIRED;
     - Integer32, Unsigned32, and Gauge32 MUST NOT be used.

I would appreciate it if you would include this item when you create
the erratum for RFC 4181.

Mike Heard

Hello,

after studying the recently published RFC 4211 authored by you
I'd like to report a couple of textual issues I found there --
some of these are even legacy issues inherited from RFC 2511.

Most issues covered below are simple typos the corrections of
which are (nearly) obvious, but a few issues require your
expertise to be corrected properly.

Therefore, I would like to obtain your comments and consent
before submitting a formal errata note to the RFC Editor.

All items below are listed in the order of their appearance
within the RFC text. To ease the recognition of the issues,
I try to point to the offending text with up/down arrows in
the form of '^^^' / 'vvv' tags contained in lines added to
the text excerpts.


(1)

Section 4.1., Signature Key POP, in the upper half of page 8,
in the explanation of the POPOSigningKey fields, says:
                                                                 vvv
     algorithmIdentifier  identifiers the signature algorithm and an
     associated parameters used to produce the POP value.

     signature  contains the POP value produce.  ...
                                              ^^
It should say:

     algorithmIdentifier  identifiers the signature algorithm and
     associated parameters used to produce the POP value.

     signature  contains the POP value produced.  ...


(2)

Section 4.2., Key Encipherment Keys, in the lower part of page 10,
in the two (doubly indented) paragraphs explaining the components
 of 'agreeMAC', uses improper names for these components -- cf.
 the ASN.1 syntax for PKMACValue at the top of page 9.
The RFC says:

        vvvvvv
        macAlg contains the algorithm identifying the method used to
        compute the MAC value.

        macValue contains the computed MAC value.
        ^^^^^^^^

It should say (I propose to make use of hierarchical subfield
notation):

        agreeMAC.algID  contains the algorithm identifying the method
        used to compute the MAC value.

        agreeMAC.value  contains the computed MAC value.


(3)

Section 4.2.1, Private Key Info Content Type, in the last paragraph
on page 11 says:

      identifier contains a name that the CA/RA can associate with the
      requestor.  This will generally be either the DN of a certificate
      or a text token passed and known to both the requestor and the
      CA/RA.  ...

It should perhaps better say:

      identifier  contains a name that the CA/RA can associate with the
      requestor.  This will generally be either the DN of a certificate
      subject or a text token passed and known to both the requestor
      ^^^^^^^^
      and the CA/RA.  ...


[Rationale: The (prospective) certificate does not have a DN,
 but its subject ...]


(4)

Section 4.4, Use of Password-Based MAC, the ASN.1 fragment at the
 bottom of page 14, says:

      PBMParameter ::= SEQUENCE {
         salt                OCTET STRING,
         owf                 AlgorithmIdentifier,
         iterationCount      INTEGER,
         mac                 AlgorithmIdentifier
         )
        ^^^

It should say:

      PBMParameter ::= SEQUENCE {
         salt                OCTET STRING,
         owf                 AlgorithmIdentifier,
         iterationCount      INTEGER,
         mac                 AlgorithmIdentifier
         }


(5)

Section 4.4, Use of Password-Based MAC, in the first text line
on page 15, says:

   The fields of PEMParameter have the following meaning:
                  ^

It should say:
                  v
   The fields of PBMParameter have the following meaning:

[Rationale: an OCR problem???]


(6)

Section 6.1, Registration Token Control, in the first paragraph
on page 19, refers to a wrong subsection; it says:

   The regToken control is used only for initialization of an end entity
   into the PKI, whereas the authenticator control (see section 7.2) can
                                                                ^
   be used for the initial as well as subsequent certification requests.

It should say:

   The regToken control is used only for initialization of an end entity
   into the PKI, whereas the authenticator control (see section 6.2) can
   be used for the initial as well as subsequent certification requests.


(7)

Section 6.3, Publication Information Control, in the upper half
of page 20, says:

   The fields of PKIPublicationInfo have the following meaning:

      action indicates whether or not the requestor wishes the CA/RA to
      publish the certificate.  The values and their means are:
                                                        ^^

It should say:

   The fields of PKIPublicationInfo have the following meaning:

      action indicates whether or not the requestor wishes the CA/RA to
      publish the certificate.  The values and their meanings are:


(8)

Section 6.3, Publication Information Control, at the bottom of
page 20, says:

  The fields of SinglePubInfo have the following meaning:

      pubMethod indicates the address type for the location at which the
      requestor desires the certificate to be placed by the CA/RA.

         dontCare indicates that the CA/RA can publish the certificate
         in whatever locations it chooses.  If dontCare is used, the
         pubInfos field MUST be omitted.
            ^^^^^

(To make the full context visible, I have shown more text than
would be necessary for the errata note.)
>From the context, I strongly suspect that the RFC text should say:

  The fields of SinglePubInfo have the following meaning:

      pubMethod indicates the address type for the location at which the
      requestor desires the certificate to be placed by the CA/RA.

         dontCare indicates that the CA/RA can publish the certificate
         in whatever locations it chooses.  If dontCare is used, the
         pubLocation field MUST be omitted.
            ^^^^^^^^

[Rationale: pubInfos is a "SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF SinglePubInfo".
 I cannot imagine how a certain value of a SinglePubInfo instance
 subfield can ever imply a MUST to omit the full enclosing structure,
 pubInfos -- which would have removed this subfield as well :-) .
 Perhaps, the text has been cloned from the explanation of the
 'dontPublish' value of the PKIPublicationInfo.action filed given
 just below the text excerpt reproduced under item (7) above
 without fully applying the proper changes.]


(9)

Section 6.4, Archive Options Control, at the bottom of page 22,
says:

   The fields of EncryptedKey have the following meaning:

      encryptedValue is longer used.  This field has been deprecated
      along with the EncryptedValue structure.

It should say:

   The fields of EncryptedKey have the following meaning:
                        vvvv
      encryptedValue  is no longer used.  This field has been
      deprecated along with the EncryptedValue structure.


(10)

The first paragraph of section 7.1, utf8Pairs, near the bottom
of page 23, says:

   This control is used to convey text-based information from the
   Subject to an RA to a CA issuing a certificate.  The OID for this
   structure is id-regInfo-utf8Paris and has a type of UTF8String.

It should perhaps say:

   This control is used to convey text-based information from the
   Subject to an RA or to a CA issuing a certificate.  The OID for
                   ^^^^                      vvvv
   this structure is id-regInfo-utf8Paris and it has a type of
   UTF8String.


(11)

Subsequently, near the top of page 24, the same section says:

                        vvvvvvvvv
   The %xx mechanism of [RFC1738] is used to encode '?' (%3f) and '%'
   (%25) if they are not being used for their reserved purpose.  Names
   MUST NOT start with a numeric character.

It should better say:

                        vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
   The %xx mechanism of Section 2.1 of STD 66 [RFC3986] is used to
   encode '?' (%3f) and '%' (%25) if they are not being used for their
   reserved purpose.  Names MUST NOT start with a numeric character.
   
[Rationale: RFC 1738 has been obsoleted; the %-escaping method is now
 covered by the above mentioned section of that Internet Standard.]
  
Accordingly, the Reference [RFC1738] needs to be updated -- see item
(13) below.


(12)

Section 9, Security Considerations, in the first paragraph on
page 26, contains the sentence:

                                                     ...  The user can
   claim that an item was signed by the entity that generated the key as
   well as any entity that might have seen the key value during transfer
   from the generator the to EE.  ...
                      ^^^^^^
It should say:

                                                     ...  The user can
   claim that an item was signed by the entity that generated the key as
   well as any entity that might have seen the key value during transfer
   from the generator to the EE.  ...
                      ^^^^^^

(13)

Section 10.2, Informative References, on page 27, contains the
following Ref. as its final entry:

   [RFC1738] Berners-Lee, T., Masinter, L., and M. McCahill, "Uniform
             Resource Locators (URL)", RFC 1738, December 1994.

According to item (11) above, this should be removed, and a new Ref.
[RFC3986] added -- to be taken from rfc-ref.txt .
Given the nature and context of the use of this Ref. in section 7.1
-- see item (11) above -- and the STD Status of RFC 3986, then
perhaps it is advisable to place this new Ref. into Section 10.1,
Normative References, not in section 10.2, Informative References.


(14)

Appendix A.2, in the last ASN.1 fragment on page 31, says:

   IP address (identifier "I"):
      <iname> ::= <oid>
                  ^^^^^

I'm in serious doubt whether this is correct:

I am not aware of a standard method to express an IP address
(i.e. an IPv4 address or an IPv6 address) as an OID.

If it *does* exist, indeed, a proper citation would be *very*
helpful; otherwise (as I expect) the ASN.1 should be corrected.
Perhaps, another  <ia5string>  would be appropriate, with
details left to [RFC3986].


(15)

Appendix B, near the middle of page 32, contains the following
[commented out] ASN.1, and ASN.1 comment:

  -- UTF8String ::= [UNIVERSAL 12] IMPLICIT OCTET STRING
         -- The contents of this type correspond to RFC 2279.
                                                        ^^^^

RFC 2279 has been obsoleted by RFC 3629 == STD 63 "long" ago.

I am aware of the fact that the UTF-8 definition in RFC 3629
syntactically and semantically by intention is a proper subset
of the definition in RFC 2279 (restriction to possible Unicode
codepoints with up to 24-bit representation).

Thus, it might be true that the reference to RFC 2279 has been
used intentionally in this ASN.1 comment, e.g., because RFC 3280
[PROFILE] (pre-3629!) referred to RFC 2279 in that context.
But, regarding the STD status of RFC 3629, a standards track RFC
like RFC 4211 should, in this case, present explicit arguments
for the deviation from STD 63. (It doesn't.)
Otherwise, the RFC should say:

  -- UTF8String ::= [UNIVERSAL 12] IMPLICIT OCTET STRING
         -- The contents of this type correspond to RFC 3629.

  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,

I'd like to report a couple of flaws I found reading the
recently published RFC 4141, "SMTP and MIME Extensions for
Content Conversion", authored by you.

I propose to post an errata note for this RFC according to the
subsequently listed items (presented in text order).
[Casually, I place change bars ('|') in column 1 to emphasize
the location of the proposed correction.]


(1)

In Section 1.2, the last paragraph at the bottom of page 4 says:

     *  three MIME Content header fields (Content-Convert, Content-
        Previous and *  Content-Features) that specify appropriate
        content header fields and record conversions that have been
        performed.

It should say:

     *  three MIME Content header fields (Content-Convert, Content-
|       Previous and Content-Features) that specify appropriate
        content header fields and record conversions that have been
        performed.


(2)

In Section 3, the fourth paragraph on page 6 says:

   When CONPERM is used, conversions are performed by the first ESMTP
   host that can obtain both the originator's permission and information
   about the capabilities supported by the recipient.  If a relay or
   client is unable to transmit the message to a next-hop that supports
   CONPERM or to perform appropriate conversion, then it terminates
   message transmission and returns a [DSNSMTP, DSNFMT, SYSCOD] to the
   originator, with status code 5.6.3 (Conversion required but not
   supported).

It should say:

   When CONPERM is used, conversions are performed by the first ESMTP
   host that can obtain both the originator's permission and information
   about the capabilities supported by the recipient.  If a relay or
   client is unable to transmit the message to a next-hop that supports
   CONPERM or to perform appropriate conversion, then it terminates
|  message transmission and returns a Delivery Status Notification (DSN)
   [DSNSMTP, DSNFMT, SYSCOD] to the originator, with status code 5.6.3
   (Conversion required but not supported).

Rationale:  Probably, that triple of RFCs should not be sent  :-)
The proposed text change conforms to the current authoring style
guides for I-Ds / RFCs, spelling out the abbreviation 'MDN' at its
first occurrance in the text.


(3)

Similarly, the final NOTE in Section 3, on page 9, says:

         NOTE: An originator MAY validate any conversions that are made
         by requesting a positive [DSNSMTP].  ...

where it should better say:

         NOTE: An originator MAY validate any conversions that are made
|        by requesting a positive DSN [DSNSMTP].  ...


(4)

The second item of the first enumerated list in Section 3.3,
on page 12, contains a (visually hidden) word replication.
The text says:

      2) MUST return a DSN notification to the originator, with status
         code 5.6.3 (Conversion required but not supported).  [DSNSMTP,
         DSNFMT, SYSCOD]

It should say:

|     2) MUST return a DSN to the originator, with status code 5.6.3
         (Conversion required but not supported).  [DSNSMTP, DSNFMT,
         SYSCOD]

Rationale: The trailing "N" of "DSN" already stands for "notification".


(5)

To make the spelling of [E]SMTP keywords and verbs consistent within
the text, the headline of Section 4.2 (on page 13),

  4.2.  CONPERM Parameter to Mail-From

should better use uppercaes spelling as well, to read:

  4.2.  CONPERM Parameter to MAIL-FROM


(6)

The ABNF given in Section 7, on page 16, and Section 8, on page 17,
does not fully conform to the contemporary (RFC 2822) style.
The ABNF in Section 7 omits the explicit specification of white
space usage that presumably has been intended.
The ABNF in Section 8 inserts a paramount of CFWS.

NOTE:
- RFC 2822 has deprecated the use of white space between header
  field names and the subsequent ":" and, as far as I can see,
  comments have not been allowed at such places by RFC 822,
  and aren't by the "obsolete syntax" in RFC 2822.
- RFC 2822 has carefully made [C]FWS an intrinsic part of many
  low-level syntactic constructs to improve readability of the
  high-level ABNF productions. Thus, CFWS should not be inserted
  again where it is (logically) already present.

Furthermore, the spelling of ABNF production names should be
self-consistent within a certain field. RFC 2822 makes use of
lowercase production (rule) names for teh syntactic description
of the Internet Message Format; therefore it seems preferrable
to follow this style when defining IMF extensions.

In the light of these explanations (and detailed inspection of
RFC 2822), the ABNF productions in Section 7 :

      Convert =                "Content-convert" ":"
                               permitted

      Permitted =              "ANY" / "NONE" / permitted-list

should perhaps be re-written as :

      convert =           "Content-convert:" [CFWS] permitted

      permitted =         "ANY" / "NONE" / permitted-list

and the ABNF productions in Section 8 :

      previous =          "Content-Previous" [CFWS] ":"
                          [CFWS]
                          date by type

      date =              "Date " [CFWS] date-time [CFWS] ";"
                          [CFWS]

      by =                "By " [CFWS] domain [CFWS] ";"
                          [CFWS]

should perhaps be re-written as :

      previous =          "Content-Previous:" date by type

      date =              "Date " [CFWS] date-time ";" [CFWS]

      by =                "By " domain ";" [CFWS]

or even (disallowing comments after "Date " - like RFC 2822 does):

      previous =          "Content-Previous:" date by type

      date =              "Date " date-time ";" [CFWS]

      by =                "By " domain ";" [CFWS]


(7)

The examples in Section 9 contain improperly truncated references
to MIME Content-Types.
The following line that appears
  -  in Section 9.1 in the 3rd text line on page 18,
and
  -  in Section 9.2 in the 10th text line :

   C: <<RFC 2822 message with MIME Content-Type:TIFF-FX

should, in both cases, read:

   C: <<RFC 2822 message with MIME Content-Type: image/TIFF-FX


(8)

In Appendix C, the headline:

  Appendix C.  MIME Content-Type Registrations

should say:

  Appendix C.  MIME Header Field Registrations


(9)

Perhaps, in Appendix C, the IANA should have been directed to
add to the MIME Header Registration for "Content-Features:"
an additional reference to RFC 4141.
E.g., add on page 25, before the "Authors' Addresses":

  C.3.  Content-Features

    This memo substantially amends the specification of the
    MIME Header Field "Content-Features:" registered by [[FEAT].
    The IANA should include into the 'Specification document(s)'
    clause of that registration a pointer to RFC 4141.

  Alfred HÎnes.

Hi,

    I just started reading the recently announced RFC 4270, and bounced
a bit when reading section 1, paragraph 3.  There are changes in this
paragraph, when compared to draft-hoffman-hash-attacks-04, which to my
mind are quite unfortunate:

The RFC says:
   Hash algorithms are used by cryptographers in a variety of security
   protocols, for a variety of purposes, at all levels of the Internet
   protocol stack.  They are used because they have two security
   properties: to be one way and collision free.

Note the " one way and collision free."  On the face of it, as plain
English, this is nonsense.  In cryptographic terminology, I believe 
the correct expression is " one-way and collision-free."  

The draft says:
   Hash algorithms are used by cryptographers in a variety of security
   protocols, for a variety of purposes, at all levels of the Internet
   protocol stack.  They are used because they have two security
   properties: to be one-way and collision-free.

I'd like an errata to be posted, correcting this back to the text in
the draft.

One of these errors re-occurs in paragraph 7 of section 2, and also
should be corrected:

RFC:
   Attacks against the "one way" property:

Should be:
   Attacks against the "one-way" property:


Regards,

	Henrik

Hello,

in the recently published RFC 4133, a reference to another new
RFC, (RFC 4152), unfortunately has been left in a boilerplate
like form 'RFCYYYY' at 4 places within the text.

I suggest to emit an errata note for RFC 4133 including the
appropriate corrections:


(1)

In the bottom half of page 10, the RFC text says:

     For example, the entPhysicalUris object may be used to encode a URI
     containing a Common Language Equipment Identifier (CLEI) URN for
     the managed physical entity.  The URN name space for CLEIs is
     defined in [RFCYYYY], and the CLEI format is defined in
     [T1.213][T1.213a].  For example, an entPhysicalUris instance may
     have the value of

        URN:CLEI:D4CE18B7AA

     [RFC3986] and [RFCYYYY] identify this as a URI in the CLEI URN name
     space.  The specific CLEI code, D4CE18B7AA, is based on the example
     provided in [T1.213a].

It should say:

     For example, the entPhysicalUris object may be used to encode a URI
     containing a Common Language Equipment Identifier (CLEI) URN for
     the managed physical entity.  The URN name space for CLEIs is

     space.  The specific CLEI code, D4CE18B7AA, is based on the example
     provided in [T1.213a].

In the 3rd-to-last item of section 8.2., on page 60, the text says:

   [RFCYYYY]     Tesink, K. and R. Fox, "A Uniform Resource Name (URN)
                 Namespace for the CLEI Code", RFC YYYY, August 2005.

It shold say:

   [RFC4152]     Tesink, K. and R. Fox, "A Uniform Resource Name (URN)
                 Namespace for the CLEI Code", RFC 4152, August 2005.

(1)

In Section 3.10., RFC 4234 says:

   The various mechanisms described above have the following precedence,
   from highest (binding tightest) at the top, to lowest (loosest) at
   the bottom:

         Strings, Names formation

         Comment

         Value range

         Repetition

         Grouping, Optional

         Concatenation

         Alternative

It should say:

   The various mechanisms described above have the following precedence,
   from highest (binding tightest) at the top, to lowest (loosest) at
   the bottom:

         Strings, Names formation

         Comment

         Value range

|        Grouping, Optional
|
|        Repetition

         Concatenation

         Alternative

This re-ordering aligns the table with the prose description and the
meta-grammar in section 4.


(2)

The following clarifications apply to the meta-grammar in section 4.

a) Near the bottom of page 10, the rule:

         repetition     =  [repeat] element

   should say:

|        repetition     =  ( [repeat] element ) / option

   At the top of page 11, the rule:

         element        =  rulename / group / option /
                           char-val / num-val / prose-val

   should say:

|        element        =  rulename / group /
                           char-val / num-val / prose-val

   These changes have the effect to formally disallow
   a <repeat> element in front of an <option>
   -- a senseless construct formerly unexpectedly allowed.

b) On page 11, the last rule:

         prose-val      =  "<" *(%x20-3D / %x3F-7E) ">"
                               ; bracketed string of SP and VCHAR
                               ;  without angles
                               ; prose description, to be used as
                               ;  last resort
   should say:

         prose-val      =  "<" *(%x20-3D / %x3F-7E) ">"
|                              ; bracketed string of:
|                              ;  SP and VCHAR without closing angle
                               ; prose description, to be used as
                               ;  last resort

   This change aligns the comment with the formal rule.


(3)

The first sentence of Appendix B.2., on page 14, says:

   Externally, data are represented as "network virtual ASCII" (namely,
   7-bit US-ASCII in an 8-bit field), with the high (8th) bit set to
   zero.

It should say:

   Externally, data are represented as "network virtual ASCII" (namely,
   7-bit US-ASCII in an 8-bit field, with the high (8th) bit set to
   zero).

This change should make it clear (as in RFC 2234) that the phrase,
"with the high (8th) bit set to zero" is an intrinsic part of the
full definition of "network virtual ASCII", and not the specification
of an exception -- or an additional manipulation for the purpose of
ABNF -- to "network virtual ASCII".

Hello,

I'd like to mention some issues I've found reading the
recently published RFC 4188 authored by you.

(Unfortunately, I've not been aware of the draft -- there
are just too many -- and thus did not comment earlier.)


(1)

There is a significant inconsistency in the newly introduced
conformance information with respect to the new
'dot1dStpPortPathCost32' object:

The  bridgeCompliance4188 MODULE-COMPLIANCE  macro
(at the bottom of page 37 and the top of page 38) says:

    GROUP   dot1dStpPortGroup2
        DESCRIPTION
           "Implementation of this group is mandatory for
            bridges that support the Spanning Tree Protocol."

    GROUP   dot1dStpPortGroup3
        DESCRIPTION
           "Implementation of this group is mandatory for bridges
            that support the Spanning Tree Protocol and 32-bit path
            costs.  In particular, this includes devices supporting
            IEEE 802.1t and IEEE 802.1w."

Now (see upper half of page 34), both dot1dStpPortGroup2 and
dot1dStpPortGroup3 contain the object 'dot1dStpPortPathCost32'.
Thus the net result of the above text is that we have two
overlapping but different requirements for that object, and
that the object 'dot1dStpPortPathCost' is not covered by
the bridgeCompliance4188 statement at all.

But, looking at the description clauses for dot1dStpPortPathCost
(on top of page 22) and dot1dStpPortPathCost32 (on page 23)
I conjecture that the original intent was to ALWAYS have
dot1dStpPortPathCost instantiated in rows of the
dot1dStpPortTable (as before, per RFC 1493), and to take
(the new semantics of) the special (max.) value 65535 for
that object as an indication that dot1dStpPortPathCost32 has
also been instantiated in the respective row; therefore, I
expect that dot1dStpPortPathCost should be included in the
conditionally mandatory groups named in bridgeCompliance4188.

The easiest way to remedy this inconsistency would be to modify
the OBJECTS list of the OBJECT-GROUP dot1dStpPortGroup2 by
replacing 'dot1dStpPortPathCost32' by 'dot1dStpPortPathCost'.
But then the definition of dot1dStpPortGroup2 would-be-word
by word identical to the definition of dot1dStpPortGroup (!)
and it might be better to replace 'dot1dStpPortGroup' for
'dot1dStpPortGroup2' on the first line of the text fragment
cited above (bottom of page 37).

Perhaps, an OBJECT clause mentioning the new semantics of the
max. value for dot1dStpPortPathCost in the past-RFC1493
context migth be appropriate as well.

I think that a correction is needed for this issue and would
like to receive your comment before formally submitting an
errata note to the RFC editor.


(2)

There is an issue (left over from RFC 1493) with the
DESCRIPTION clauses for the objects dot1dTpPortInFrames and
dot1dTpPortOutFrames on page 28 of RFC 4188.
The latter contains wording improper for outgoing frames
(obviously copied unchanged from the former), and both
descriptions contain a duplicate "only" within a phrase.

I propose to clarify (and simplify the wording of) these
descriptions as follows.

a) Replace:

    dot1dTpPortInFrames OBJECT-TYPE
        ...
        DESCRIPTION
           "The number of frames that have been received by this
            port from its segment.  Note that a frame received on the
            interface corresponding to this port is only counted by
            this object if and only if it is for a protocol being
            processed by the local bridging function, including
            bridge management frames."

   by:

    dot1dTpPortInFrames OBJECT-TYPE
        ...
        DESCRIPTION
           "The number of frames that have been received by this
            port from its segment.  Note that a frame received on
            the interface corresponding to this port is counted by
            this object if and only if it is consumed by the local
            bridging function, including bridge management frames."

b) Replace:

    dot1dTpPortOutFrames OBJECT-TYPE
        ...
        DESCRIPTION
           "The number of frames that have been transmitted by this
            port to its segment.  Note that a frame transmitted on
            the interface corresponding to this port is only counted
            by this object if and only if it is for a protocol being
            processed by the local bridging function, including
            bridge management frames."
   by:

    dot1dTpPortOutFrames OBJECT-TYPE
        ...
        DESCRIPTION
           "The number of frames that have been transmitted by this
            port to its segment.  Note that a frame transmitted on
            the interface corresponding to this port is counted by
            this object if and only if it originates from a local
            bridging function, including bridge management frames."

Please correct me if this proposal does not match the original
intent of these DESCRIPTIONs.
(Concern: If the bridge is manageable, the management agent might
reside on the bridge that in this case would have an IP address and
perform the SNMP protocol stack and/or other IP protocols as well.
It might be the case that it was intended to include such locally
destined/originated packets of non-IEEE802.1D functions into the
above counters as well.
Important remark: IEEE802.1D clause 14.6.1.1.3, e.g., includes
"BPDUs, frames addressed to the Bridge as an end station, and
frames that were submitted to the forwarding process" into the
'Frames Received' count! Therefore, the REFERENCE clauses pointing
to that 802.1D clause might be considered inappropriate as well,
for both objects.)

  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
I'd like to send you a few comments on the new RFC 4151
authored by you.

First of all, after all the embarrassment with the abuse
of resolvable (mostly HTTP) URIs -- i.e. "URL"s in the
historical sense -- to identify abstract objects, methods,
algorithms, and the like, I appreciate the idea to have
something like those 'tag' URIs at hand for the identification
of abstract resources, whenever the originators believe the
use of natural choice (OIDs) to be improper for the disired
purpose.
But wouldn't it have been more natural and appropriate (to make
the distinction to [resolvable/accessible] URIs clearly visible)
to define an URN namespace for this purpose (resulting in tags
of the form "urn:tag:...") instead of a general URI scheme?

Further, there are two issues with References in RFC 4151:

o   Once more, this new RFC (like others!) normatively refers to
    the now obsolete RFC 2234.
    RFC 4234, published several weeks before(!) RFC 4151, has
    superseded and formally obsoleted RFC 2234 on the IETF
    Standards Track and should be named as Ref. [2] in RFC 4151.

o   Is the Informative Ref. [5] of RFC 4151 meant to point at
    RFC 4122 ? -- If so, it should !

It might be considered to issue an appropriate RFC Errata Note
for these issues.
Please comment.

Best Regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

No, URNs are still generally seen as identifiers for information
resources (documents), just not ones associated with domain names.
There are URL resolution mechanisms, right?

Have you read RFC 3305?

Hello,
I just read your new RFC 4217 and would like to submit
a few comments / errata notes.

First of all, thanks for this useful memo and the in-depth
discussion of important details.

Also, I appreciate your allusion on the deficiencies of the
dated FTP spec in RFC 959 that appears in the text.  Like a
couple of other old IETF Standards, that memo today certainly
wouldn't pass IETF and IESG review for a Standards Track RFC.
It would be certainly worth the effort to write updated and
precise specifications for FTP, TCP, etc. -- but I'm sure,
nobody will do so in the near future :-)

Next, here are a few textual issues I found in RFC 4214:


(1) Inconsistent / Outdated Ref.

Why the hack does the *Abstract* of RFC 4214 refer to RFC 2487,
whereas the remainder of the text (including the References section)
correctly refers to RFC 3207 that once had obsoleted RFC 2487 ?


(2) Typo

The 'Note' in section 12.5, at the bottom of page 20, says:

        "...  This contrasts the with situation when ..."

where it should say:

        "...  This contrasts with the situation when ..."


(3) Another typo

The last bullet in section 20, on page 26, obviously contains
incomplete text. It says:

   "o  The various people who have help author this document ..."

Perhaps, it should say:

   "o  The various people who have helped [to] author this document ..."
or:
   "o  The various people who have helped the author of this
       document ..."


Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
I'd like to sumbit a few comments on the recent RFC 4237,
"Voice Messaging Directory Service", authored by you.

(1)

IMHO, it is unfortunate that the RFC text doesn't state the
value of the IANA assigned OID tree; the text always uses
the placehoulder "IANA-ASSIGNED-OID", even in Section 4.
This deficiency makes the job of the reader more difficult
than necessarily.

To minimize the impact on the text, I propose the following
(minimal) correction:

RFC 4237, in Section 4.1, on page 9, says:

   IANA has registered an LDAP Object Identifier for use in this
   technical specification, according to the following template:

It should say:

   IANA has registered an LDAP Object Identifier for use in this
   technical specification, according to the following template.
   This Object Identifier, 1.3.6.1.1.11, is referred to as the
   "IANA-ASSIGNED-OID" in the body of this memo.


(2)

I suspect that the OID value given in Section 2 is not correct.
It does not match the one listed in section 4.2, on page 10,
4th text line.

Therefore I propose the following erratum:

RFC 4237, at the beginning of Section 2, on page 3, says:

   (IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.1 NAME 'vPIMUser'
           SUP 'top'
           ...          )

it should say:
                       vv
   (IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.1.1 NAME 'vPIMUser'
           SUP 'top'
           ...          )


(3)

There's a small textual flaw at the end of Section 2.5.
I propose the following errata note:

RFC 4237, at the end of Section 2.5, on page 5, says:

   Because ADPCM is a required format, the audio32kadpcm value must be
   listed if this attribute is present.
                                               ^^
it should say:
                                                v
   Because ADPCM is a required format, the audio/32kadpcm value must
   be listed if this attribute is present.


If you agree, the three errata notices proposed above should be
submitted for publication on the RFC-Ed's RFC Errata web pages.


Best Regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

I'm also not aware of any strict technical requirement.
It just seems to be the usual procedure to group the OIDs used
in an LDAP schema definition according to their 'Type'
(2nd column in the IANA registry), e.g., for RFC 4237,

  <IANA-ASSIGNED-OID>.1.<m>  ... ObjectClasses
  <IANA-ASSIGNED-OID>.2.<n>  ... Attributes

And that's what the IANA has done, and what is documented on
page 10 of the RFC.  (Thus all defined 'leaf' schema entities
are "living" at the same OID depth.)

I just want to achieve consistency between Section 2 and page 10
of the RFC (and the IANA assignment published on their web site).

I hope the above explanations will help.

Because my initial mail already had been CC'ed to the RFC-Ed,
I do so again.


Alfred.

Hello,

I just read the recently published RFC 4282 (revised NAI spec)
authored by you and would like to submit a few comments.


Unfortunately, the text of that RFC does not fully reflect the
established state of the IETF standards, by referring to obsolete
documents (e.g., ex STD 10, RFC 821) and ignoring effective updates,
e.g., STD 3, RFC 1123, and RFC 2821.

In particular, the text of RFC 4282 repeatedly (e.g. in Section
2.6.) emphasizes making a deviation from established standards
for host / domain names.

This is not true!
The pretended deviation in fact reflects the current standards.

The modification to RFC 952, RFC 821, et al. has already been
introduced into the IETF Standards by STD 3, RFC 1123 (Host
Requirements, Part II), published 16 years ago, in October 1989.
Section 2.1 of that RFC, on page 13, says:

    "One aspect of host name syntax is hereby changed: the
     restriction on the first character is relaxed to allow
     either a letter or a digit. Host software MUST support
     this more liberal syntax."

and continues saying:

    "Host software MUST handle host names of up to 63 characters
     and SHOULD handle host names of up to 255 characters."

Therefore, it would have been strongly advisable to point out
on page 6 of RFC 4282, in Section 2.2, first bullet, that the
named rules in RFC 2865 **DO NOT CONFORM** with STD 3 !!!

Note: IMHO, it is a fundamental design flaw of RADIUS and certain
other protocols using TLVs, AVPs, -- or however similar protocol
objects are named -- to specify that the 'length' information
(being stored in a single octet) is to comprise the cumulative
size of the Type, Length and Value fields, instead of just giving
the size of the Value (payload) field; the latter solution would
always allow to fully exhaust the total range of an 8-bit unsigned
Length and thereby allow payload octet strings of size 0..255 !


Similarly, RFC 4282 ignores the standardization state of the
proprietary historic tunnelling protocols that have served as
'precursors with major deficiencies to learn from' for the
development of L2TP, the only comparable protocol named in 
RFC 4282 that is on the IETF Standards Track.

  o   L2F [RFC2341] has been published for information only
      as a Historic RFC 'ab initio'.

  o   PPTP [RFC2637] has purposely been rejected by the IETF --
      because of its well known significant security flaws, among
      other issues, and the Informational RFC 2637 has been
      published with a very clear IESG Note to this end.

I am surprised that a new Standards Track RFC is getting published
that repeatedly refers to obsolete protocols equally as to official
protocols, in a manner that does not make clear the distinction.
The continued unreflected use of PPTP, in particular, is seen by
major security consultants as 'one of the most widespread trojan
horses' in the current Internet.  We should do everything to
communicate and emphasize the 1998/1999 decisions of the IETF and
IESG and the reasons behind it, and push the evolved standards!


Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

and would like to submit a few comments.

(1)

First of all, I welcome the clarifications and the separation
of RFC 2048 into two distinct memos.

Nevertheless, the official naming of both RFCs as BCP 13 is
perhaps a bit unfortunate, and -- being the first appearance of
such a "double BCP" -- it obviously overcharges the existing
capabilities of certain RFC Editor tools, e.g. to produce
"rfcxx00.txt".  Future development and management of IETF
publications would certainly be made easier if such numeration
practice would have been avoided.

[Begin of Note]:

I personally have introduced a 'dot' notation like the one used
above for better references to 'multivalued' STDs many years ago,
e.g., I refer to RFC 3414 as "STD62.4" in our internal "meta-RFC"
data base.  This notation might be convenient for reference to
IETF STD RFCs in general. It would allow similarly named symbolic
links from the "in-notes/std/" subdirectory to the proper RFCs
without pasting these RFCs together into huge aggregate "stdxx.txt"
documents, and thus alleviate the change management in case of an
update to one ore more STD 'component(s)' (as it has happend, e.g.,
to STD 10) without a need to modify "never changing documents".
And its use would avoid silly and unlogical wording, e.g., such as
in the current "MIB Boilerplate" text,

  "... STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579],
   and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580] ..."

that linguistically correct (but apparently not accepted) should
better read:

  "... STD 58: RFC 2578 [RFC2578], RFC 2579 [RFC2579], and
   RFC 2580 [RFC2580] ..." ,

turning the original phrase into a logically consistent form:

  "... STD 58.1, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58.2, RFC 2579 [RFC2579],
   and STD 58.3, RFC 2580 [RFC2580] ..."

[End of Note]

(2)

I miss a discussion of the "model" primary media type (originating
from RFC 2077 -- which is on the Standards Track as well) in Section
4.2. of RFC 4288.
Perhaps, an up-to-date "statement of direction from the gurus"
would have been appropriate to give guidance and marking off the
"model" and "application" primary media types.

(3)

Finally, two small editorial issues:

- Perhaps as an artifact of the conversion of text from an existing
  RFC to a revised memo in I-D format and finally back to RFC format,
  along with repeated re-pagination, it can be observed from time to
  time that there appear unexpected blank lines in RFC text which
  visually break sentences aparts.  This recurring arifact has hit
  RFC 4288 near the top of its pages #8 and #10.

  [
    Future revisions of RFC-Ed tools might be able to recognize
    potential occurrances of this artifact, e.g. by applying the
    following (proposed) criteria:
    - an end-of-line in text without a trailing period,
    - followed by one [or more] blank line[s],
    - followed by another text line of the same indentation level
      as before, starting with a lowercase initial character;
    'telegram style' enumerations -- without complete sentences and
    without punctuation marks -- might be recognizable exceptions.
  ]

- On page 8, apparently a significant word has been lost;
  Section 4.2.2 says:
                                                                v
    A Media type of "image" indicates that the content specifies or more
    separate images that require appropriate hardware to display. ...

  It obviously should say:
                                                                vvvvv
    A Media type of "image" indicates that the content specifies one or
    more separate images that require appropriate hardware to display.
    ...

  This issue might be considered for submission as an Errata Note.
  Please comment/decide.


Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Frankly, I do not. In retrospect and considering recent events the split
appears to have been a collosal waste of my and everyone else's time. What's
done is done, of course, but if I had it to do over I would not have agreed to
it or done it.

This is the second time I've been burned - this time pretty badly - by agreeing
to a document split. (The first one was MIME itself.) You may rest assured it
will not happen again with any document I edit.

The assignment of BCP, STD, and FYI numbers is an RFC Editor task; it is not
something authors have any control over. That said, the existing example of STD
numbers being able to refer to multiple documents argues strongly IMO for what
was done here, for consistency if nothing else.

Well, all I can say is that appears to me to be a solution in search of a
problem. The ability of the meta-sequence numbers to refer to multiple
documents hasn't been a source of confusion or other issues in my experience.

This is not to say the currrent procedures doesn't have problems that need to
be solved. IMO they do - but this just isn't one of them.

A real problem is the state of affairs that arises when a proposed standard
obsoletes a full standard. As a specific example, RFC 822 being declared
obsolete by the publication of RFC 2822 is a source of significant ongoing
confusion in the community. (And no, I don't have any suggestion as to how to
solve this one, but perhaps some sort of numbering convetion would make sense
in this case.)

I considered adding additional information about model to this revision but
ultimately rejected it in the interests of time. As it was the publication of
these revised procedures took far too long. Adding model to the mix would
almost certainly reopened additional old debates and stretched out the process
even longer.

I hope this can be dealt with in a subsequent revision because I agree it would
be best to have model in there.

Simply put, it isn't, because that's not what happened. RFC 2048 was formatted
using nroff. The nroff sources where hand-converted to xml2rfc format by me.
The RFC Editor had both the XML source and of course the Internet Draft to work
with.

As an aside, as part of the author 48 process I took the opportunity to update
the xml2rfc source to match the published RFC.

  This recurring arifact has hit
>   RFC 4288 near the top of its pages #8 and #10.

I assume you're referring to the break between "linear" and "sequence". I agree
it should not have been there. However, it appears that it was introduced as
part of whatever process the RFC Editor uses. The XML source file for this
reads as follows:

<t>
Plain text does not
provide for or allow formatting commands, font attribute specifications,
processing instructions, interpretation directives, or content markup.  Plain
text is seen simply as a linear sequence of characters, possibly interrupted by
line breaks or page breaks.  Plain text MAY allow the stacking of several
characters in the same position in the text.  Plain text in scripts like Arabic
and Hebrew may also include facilities that allow the arbitrary mixing of text
segments with opposite writing directions.
</t>

I further note that this break corresponds to a page break in the I-D.

The poor break on page 10 appears to have a similar genesis. And both of
these went unnoticed because the differences tool used to compare the final
RFC with the Internet Draft cannot tell the difference between a page break
in the middle of a paragraph in the I-D and a paragraph break in the RFC.

IMO a better way to correct this as well as numerous other problems would be
for the RFC Editor to make better use of the XML source and xml2rfc. The fact
that these errors crept in makes me think that the XML sources were not used,
and that the nroff was generated from the I-D text. Unless there's something
deeply broken in xml2rfc's nroff output, the nroff should not have contained an
explicit page break in either of these cases.

Better use of XML source and xml2rfc would also make it far easier for authors
to resync their XML sources to the published RFC. The amount of time it takes
to do this manually is considerable.

But again, this is something only the RFC Editor can fix - authors clearly
cannot specify the tools the RFC Editor uses.

Yep, that's a typo. I've corrected it in my XML source and IMO an errata note
would be appropriate.

Hello,

reading the recently published RFC 4241 authored by you I find an
unfortunate truncation of the text on page 4.

The 3rd paragraph of the indented, bulleted enumeration in
Section 2.3 only contains a fragment of a sentence; after studying
Figure 2 on page 6, I suspect that a Request message from the PE to
the CPE should be described here in a third bulleted item, the first
line(s) of which has/have been dropped by accident during editing:

      [ ....??? ... ]
      IA_PD option and IA_PD Prefix options for the chosen prefix(es)
      back to the PE.

Please supply the missing text.

For clarity, it might also be useful to amend the final bulleted
sentence (which becomes the fourth item by the suspected correction),

    o The PE confirms the prefix(es) in the Request message in a Reply
      message.

by explicitely naming mentioning the destination of that message.


I recommend to post an Errata Note for this issue.

There also are a few minor textual flaws, all on page 5 of RFC 4241,
which might be reflected in that Errata Note as well:

In the last paragraph of Section 2.5, the sentence:

       The CPE should return ICMPv6 Destination Unreachable message to
   a source address or silently discard the packets, when the original
   packet is destined for the unassigned prefix in the delegated prefix.

should better say:

       The CPE should return an ICMPv6 Destination Unreachable message
   to the source address or silently discard the packet when the original
   packet is destined for an unassigned prefix in the delegated prefix.

The second paragraph of Section 2.6,

   Devices connected to user network may learn a recursive DNS server
   address with the mechanism described in [RFC3736].

should better say:

   Devices connected to the user network may learn a recursive DNS
   server address with the mechanism described in [RFC3736].

And finally, the first sentence in Section 2.8,

   ICMPv6 Echo Request will be sent to the user network for connectivity
   monitoring in the service.

should better say:

   ICMPv6 Echo Requests will be sent to the user network for
   connectivity monitoring in the service.

  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,

I'd like to submit a few comments on the LMP RFC 4204 recently
published, using the 'Contact Address' given therein.

The numbered items are presented below according to the first
appearance of a text passage raising the issues.
I freely insert lines with '^^^^' style tags to emphasize the
places of proposed changes to the text.

[Admittedly, that RFC contains an extraordinarily small number
 of typos compared with other documents of similar size!]

- - - - - - - - - - - - -

(1)

Section 10 specifies the required behaviour of *aperiodic*
transmission retries with exponential backoff.

(1a)
Nevertheless, at various places the text talks about "periodically"
transmitting certain messages.  It should better say "repeated[ly]".

Examples for this issue are:
  -  Section 11.1.1, page 28 : introduction, and
     the paragraphs labelled "ConfSend:" and "Active:" ;
  -  Section 11.1.2, page 30, text for event '12a)' ;
  -  Section 11.2.1, page 32 : introduction, and
     the paragraphs labelled "Init:" and "Up:" ;
  -  Section 11.3.1, page 35 : paragraph labelled "Test:" ;
  -  Section 12.3.1, page 42, last paragraph;
  -  Section 12.4, page 43, last paragraph;
  -  Section 12.5.1, page 44, last paragraph;
  -  Section 12.5.4, first line on page 46;
  -  Section 12.5.6, final paragraph on page 46 (twice);
  -  Section 12.6.1, second paragraph on page 48.

(1b)
At the bottom of page 26, Section 10.1 defines the following
parameter:

   Rapid retry limit Rl:

      Rl is the maximum number of times a message will be transmitted
      without being acknowledged.

The naming of this variable is very unfortunate because in similar
contexts in protocol design, the "retry limit" customarily defines the
(maximum) number of *re*-tries -- with 0 meaning no retries at all,
1 meaning a single retry, etc.
The definition given means that the maximum number of retries will
be  <Rl> - 1 , thereby restricting the allowed range for <Rl> to 1
or above, excluding the value 0, without mentioning this fact.

Because Section 10.2 codifies the abovementioned definition and this
certainly should not be changed after the fact of publication as an
RFC, it might be advisable to post a warning note pointing to the
specific semantics of 'retry limit' with LMP, the admitted value
range, and in particular the use '1' for <Rl> to inhibit retries.


(2)

Section 12.2, on page 41, codifies an (unfortunately very popular)
design flaw: the 'Length' field in LMP objects is specified as
comprising the cumulative size of the object contents *and* the
object prefix (4 bytes).  This unnecessarily creates illegal
values (0..3) for 'Length' which must be checked for in all
implementations.  It would have been very muck preferrable to have
'Length' just giving the size of the object contents (in bytes),
whereby Length=0 would be the very mnemonic (and most efficiently
testable) condition for empty object content

[Note: In the case of LMP objects the 16 bit width of length does
 not constitute an artificial limitation to the size of the object
 contents, because the whole message must be shorter than 2**16
 bytes. This *is* a problem, e.g., for RADIUS with its single-octet
 'Length' !]


(3)

In Section 13.2, on page 51, the explanatory text after the diagram
for 'C-Type = 1' says:

  Node_Id:

     This identities the node that originated the LMP packet.
                ^
where it should say:

  Node_Id:

     This identifies the node that originated the LMP packet.
                ^
Similarly, following the diagram for 'C-Type = 2', the same section
says at the top of page 52:

   Node_Id:

      This identities the remote node.
                 ^
where it should say:

  Node_Id:

      This identifies the remote node.
                 ^

(4) Section 13.8

a) The explanation for "Flags:" on page 57 contains the improperly
indented and punctuated entry:

      vvv
         0x0002 Data Link Type

            If set, the data links to be verified are ports, otherwise
            they are component links
                                    ^
It should specify instead:

      0x0002 Data Link Type

            If set, the data links to be verified are ports, otherwise
            they are component links.
                                    ^

b) The explanation for "Verify Transport Mechanism:", on top of
page 58, contains:

      0x8000 Payload:Test Message transmitted in the payload
                    ^^
It should say:

      0x8000 Payload: Test Message transmitted in the payload
                    ^^^


(5) Wavelength encodings

This issue is related to:
  -  Section 13.8, on page 57/58,  and
  -  Section 13.12.1, on page 64 plus Section 13.12.1.2 on page 65.

Obviously -- and unfortunately --, RFC 4204 avoids specifying the
admissible encoding[s] and the related units for data elements
specifying Wavelengths.

I suspect there could not be reached consensus on a single encoding
style.  Nevertheless it would have been very desirable for the sake
of interoperability to specify a (small) set of standard encodings,
e.g.:
  -  IEEE floating point, units: meters;
  -  unsigned32, units: nanometers (or picometers?);
  -  unsigned32 implementation specific wavelength identifiers;
  -  0 always meaning: 'implicit / known by out-of-band methods'.

All occurences on 'Wavelength' data elements would have allowed for
the addition of some kind of 'wavelength encoding selector', e.g.
as a 2-/3-/4-bit subfield of the already present 'Flags' field,
or separate values of the already present 'subobject type'.


(6)

Section 13.12.1, on page 64, below the diagram, says:

   Switching Type: 8 bits

      This is used to identify the local Interface Switching Type of the
      TE link as defined in [RFC3471].
      ^^
Studying the context lead me to the conclusion that it probably
should say:

      This is used to identify the local Interface Switching Type of the
      Data link as defined in [RFC3471].
      ^^^^


(7)

Section 16, near the bottom of page 77, contains wording inconsistent
the remainder of this section and with other parts of the document.
The two paragraphs:

   The policy for allocating values out of the LMP Object Class name
   space is part of the definition of the specific Class instance.  When
   a Class is defined, its definition must also include a description of
   the policy under which the Object Class names are allocated.

   The policy for allocating values out of the LMP Sub-object Class name
   space is part of the definition of the specific Class instance.  When
   a Class is defined, its definition must also include a description of
   the policy under which sub-objects are allocated.

should better say:
                                                                vvvv
   The policy for allocating values out of the LMP Object Class type
   (C-type) name space is part of the definition of the specific Class
   instance.  When a Class is defined, its definition must also include
   a description of the policy under which the Object Class types are
   allocated.

   The policy for allocating values out of the LMP Sub-object Class type
   (C-type) name space is part of the definition of the specific Class
   instance.  When a Class is defined, its definition must also include
   a description of the policy under which sub-objects are allocated.

[Notes:
 The primary name space is the Class type (C-type) name space because
 its management is essential for interoperability; the class names are
 subordinated additional labels for the human reader and implementor.
 Above, I have added "(C-type)" for clarity; this is not absolutely
 necessary, if you dislike the repetition here.
]


(8)

There's another small typo in Section 16, at mid-page 82:
The headline:

   o CHANNEL_STATUS_REQUESTClass name (14)

should be:

   o CHANNEL_STATUS_REQUEST Class name (14)

- - - - - - - - - - - - -

Please comment and decide which of the items above should be
submitted for an RFC Errata Note.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,

reading the recently published RFC 4268 authored by you
I caught a few textual flaws the correction of which might
be considered as candidate for an RFC Errata Note, or else be
filed for reference in case of any future update to this RFC.


(1)

In the CONTACT-INFO clauses of both MODULE-IDENTITY instances
(page 6 and page 10), apparently a text line (between the two
HTTP URIs given) has been blanked out inadvertently; usually,
        "Working Group Charter:"
appears at similar places in other MIB definitions.


(2) [typo]

The DESCRIPTION clause of the EntityAlarmStatus TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
declaration contains a funny 'byte twist'.
 It says (near the middle of page 8):

       When the 'value of underRepair' is set, the resource is
       currently being repaired, ...

It should say:

       When the value of 'underRepair' is set, the resource is
       currently being repaired, ...


(3) [--- this is the only hard stuff in this note ! ---]

In the DESCRIPTION clause of the entStateAdmin OBJECT-TYPE
declaration, the second paragraph on page 12 says:

                               vvvvvvvvvvvv
       Setting this object to 'notSupported' will result
       in an 'inconsistentValue' error.  [...]

This is insonsistent with the value range for the EntityAdminState
TEXTUAL-CONVENTION describing the syntax of this object.
(Perhaps there's some history behind the scene.)
I suspect that in fact this sentence should say:

                               vvvvvvv
       Setting this object to 'unknown' will result in an
       'inconsistentValue' error.  [...]

(4) [typo/grammar]

The fourth paragraph of the DESCRIPTION clause of the entStateOper
OBJECT-TYPE, 10 text lines from the bottom of page 12, says:

       A value of 'testing' means that entity currently being
       tested and cannot therefore report whether it is
       operational or not.

It should perhaps better say:
                                                       vvvv
       A value of 'testing' means that entity currently is
       being tested and cannot therefore report whether it
       is operational or not.


(5) [editing omission?]

The DESCRIPTION clause of the entStateStandby OBJECT-TYPE, near
mid-page 14, says:

       Some entities will exhibit only a subset of the
       remaining standby state values.  [...]
       ^^^^^^^^^^
Perhaps this text has been 'cloned' without full adaptation.
Since, in this case, no possible value of the object has been
excluded by the text, the word "remaining" is inappropriate in
this context.  Therefore, this clause should better say:

       Some entities will exhibit only a subset of the
       standby state values.  [...]


(6) + (7)  [typo/grammar]

The second paragraph of the DESCRIPTION clause of each of the
two NOTIFICATION-TYPE declarations, near the bottom of page 14
and near the top of page 15, contains the sentence:

       The entity this notification refers can be identified by
       extracting the entPhysicalIndex from one of the
       variable bindings.  [...]

Preferrably, this sentence should better say (in both instances):

                                          vvvv
       The entity this notification refers to can be identified
       by extracting the entPhysicalIndex from one of the
       variable bindings.  [...]


Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
reading the recently published RFC 4119 authored by you, I found
one of the most famous logical paradoxes incorporated there,
making the pure existence of RFC 4119 very doubtful  :-)

Details:
=======

On mid-page 8, RFC 4119 specifies:
                                                     [...]  If the
    value in the 'retention-expires' element has already passed when
    the Location Recipient receives the Location Object, the Recipient
    MUST discard the Location Object immediately.

Now, RFC 4119 contains examples of Location Objects. Thus, the reader
of RFC 4119 (or his workstation) becomes a Location Recipient.
But those examples of Location Objects contained in RFC 4119 specify
a 'retention-expires' date that has passed *long before* the
publication of RFC 4119.
Therefore, every reader of RFC 4119, and every system receiving a
copy of RFC 4119, MUST immediately discard the RFC; moreover,
even the RFC editor SHOULD NOT ever have processed the draft!

But in this case, the above rule would not have become effective,
making these actions, creation and reading of the RFC, legitimate
again ...


Very nice!!!!


Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Dear all,
I would like to show you an ambiguity in RFC 3261.
The ABNF for SIP in RFC 3261 page 227 defines header Accept as "Accept = 
"Accept" HCOLON [accept-range *(COMMA accept-range)].
Expanding this form we have:
Accept = "Accept" HCOLON [( (...) *(SEMI m-parameter) *(SEMI 
accept-param) ) *(COMMA accept-range)]
For example we can have
Accept: 
application/sdp;m_extension_parameter=value1;accept_extension_param=value2;q=0.5
We know from RFC 3261 that q is an accept-param.
We don't know how to consider the first two unknown parameters: how to 
distinguish from m-parameter and accept-param?

While in ohter cases RFC 3261 shows the rules to solve ambiguities (for 
example how to consider the parameters in a Contact URI if the URI is 
not enclosed in angular brakets) I have not found any suggestion for 
this specific case in RFC 3261.

Best Regards,
Marco Ambu

Hello,
I'd like to submit a few comments on the recently published
RFC 4226.  (You are receiving this note because your email
address is given there as the primary contact address.)

There are a couple of textual flaws in the RFC text the correction
of which might be considered for posting an appropriate Errata Note
on the RFC Editor's web site.

The issues I've found are listed below in the order they appear in
the text.  Occasionally I have added change bars '|' in column 1 or
'^^^' style tags to point to the position of a textual flaw and/or
the proposed change within the citiations presented.
Where necessary, I also have re-formatted the text proposals to
match RFC formatting rules.


(1)  [ 2 typos ]

The text of Section 5.3, in the 2nd and 3rd paragraph on page 7,
says:

   The reason for masking the most significant bit of P is to avoid
   confusion about signed vs. unsigned modulo computations.  Different
   processors perform these operations differently, and masking out the
|  signed bit removes all ambiguity.
       ^^
   Implementations MUST extract a 6-digit code at a minimum and possibly
   7 and 8-digit code.  Depending on security requirements, Digit = 7 or
   more SHOULD be considered in order to extract a longer HOTP value.

It should say:

   The reason for masking the most significant bit of P is to avoid
   confusion about signed vs. unsigned modulo computations.  Different
   processors perform these operations differently, and masking out the
|  sign bit removes all ambiguity.

   Implementations MUST extract a 6-digit code at a minimum and possibly
|  7 and 8-digit codes.  Depending on security requirements, Digit = 7
   or more SHOULD be considered in order to extract a longer HOTP value.


(2)  [ inappropriate restriction specified + formatting flaw ]

On page 17, Appendix A.1 contains the text:

   Let IntDiv(a,b) denote the integer division algorithm that takes
|  input integers a, b where a >= b >= 1 and returns integers (q,r)
|
   the quotient and remainder, respectively, of the division of a by b.
   (Thus, a = bq + r and 0 <= r < b.)

The restriction  "a >= b"  is not necessary and in fact inappropriate;
the additional blank line seems to be an artifact of the editing
process.  Thus, the above text should better read:

   Let IntDiv(a,b) denote the integer division algorithm that takes
|  input integers a, b where  b >= 1  and returns integers (q,r), the
   quotient and remainder, respectively, of the division of a by b.
   (Thus, a = bq + r and 0 <= r < b.)


(3)  [ conflicting naming of variables ]

In Appendix A.3, unfortunately the necessary distinction between
the counter value kept with the user and the counter value kept
at the server is not preserved in the variable names introduced.
This leads to significant confusion.
I hereby propose a 'minimally invasive' text modification as
follows (Cf. Appendix E.3 for another notation) :

The text of the 2nd and 3rd paragraph of Appendix A.3, on page 18 :

   The scenario we are considering is that a user and server share a key
   K for ALG.  Both maintain a counter C, initially zero, and the user
   authenticates itself by sending ALG(K,C) to the server.  The latter
   accepts if this value is correct.

   In order to protect against accidental increment of the user counter,
   the server, upon receiving a value z, will accept as long as z equals
   ALG(K,i) for some i in the range C,...,C + s-1, where s is the
   resynchronization parameter and C is the server counter.  If it
   accepts with some value of i, it then increments its counter to i+1.
   If it does not accept, it does not change its counter value.

should be modified to say:

   The scenario we are considering is that a user and server share a key
|  K for ALG.  Both maintain a counter C and C', respectively, initially
   zero, and the user authenticates itself by sending ALG(K,C) to the
   server.  The latter accepts if this value is correct.

   In order to protect against accidental increment of the user counter,
   the server, upon receiving a value z, will accept as long as z equals
|  ALG(K,i) for some i in the range C',...,C' + s-1, where s is the
|  resynchronization parameter and C' is the server counter.  If it
   accepts with some value of i, it then increments its counter to i+1.
   If it does not accept, it does not change its counter value.


(4)  [ typo ]

Near the bottom of page 18, the 2nd-to-last paragraph of Appendix A.3
(on that page) says:

                                                    ...  It wins if the
   server accepts this accumulator.
                       ^^^^^^^^^^^
It should say instead:

                                                    ...  It wins if the
   server accepts this authenticator.


(5)  [ another typo, and continuation of (3) above ]

Still in Appendix A.3, the text on the upper half of page 19 contains
a wrong (undefined) variable name 'O' which should be 'A' instead,
and it should be adapted according to item (3) above.
The text says:

   Oracle AuthO()
   --------------
      A = ALG(K,C)
      C = C + 1
      Return O to B

   Oracle VerO(A)
   --------------
      i = C
      While (i <= C + s - 1 and Win == FALSE) do
         If A == ALG(K,i) then Win = TRUE; C = i + 1
         Else i = i + 1
      Return Win to B

It should say:

   Oracle AuthO()
   --------------
      A = ALG(K,C)
      C = C + 1
|     Return A to B

   Oracle VerO(A)
   --------------
|     i = C'
|     While (i <= C' + s - 1 and Win == FALSE) do
|        If A == ALG(K,i) then Win = TRUE; C' = i + 1
         Else i = i + 1
      Return Win to B


(6)  [ typos in mathematical text ]

Lemma 1 and its proof in Appendis A.4.1, on page 20, contains
several typos.

In Lemma 1, the line,

          P_{N,m}(z) = Pr [x mod m = z : x randomly pick in Z_{n}]
                                                              ^^^
should read:

          P_{N,m}(z) = Pr [x mod m = z : x randomly pick in Z_{N}]

This corrects the use of an undefined variable, n, by using the
variable N as expected from the LHS term.

In the Proof of Lemma 1, the case distinction for z contains an
improper relational operator at two places.
To adjust to the possible range of values (cf. item (2) above!),
the formula parts:

   P_{N,m}(z)  =  [ ... ]

                = mq/N * 1/m +
                   (N - mq)/N * 1 / (N - mq)     if 0 <= z < N - mq
|                  0                             if N - mq <= z <= m
                                                               ^^^^
                = q/N +
                   r/N * 1 / r                   if 0 <= z < N - mq
|                  0                             if r <= z <= m
                                                          ^^^^
should be modified to read:

   P_{N,m}(z)  =  [ ... ]

                = mq/N * 1/m +
                   (N - mq)/N * 1 / (N - mq)     if 0 <= z < N - mq
|                  0                             if N - mq <= z < m

                = q/N +
                   r/N * 1 / r                   if 0 <= z < N - mq
|                  0                             if r <= z < m


(7)  [ formatting flaw ]

Appendix A.4.3, on mid-page 22, contains improperly formatted text.
It says:

   Proposition 2 ------------- Suppose m = 10^Digit < 2^31, and let
   (q,r) = IntDiv(2^31,m).  Let B be any adversary attacking HOTP-IDEAL
   using v verification oracle queries and a <= 2^c - s authenticator
   oracle queries.  Then  [...]

It should say:

   Proposition 2
   -------------

   Suppose m = 10^Digit < 2^31, and let (q,r) = IntDiv(2^31,m).  Let B
   be any adversary attacking HOTP-IDEAL using v verification oracle
   queries and a <= 2^c - s authenticator oracle queries.  Then  [...]


(8)  [ typo ]

Within Appendix A.5, in the lower half of page 23, the text for
"Assumption 1" says:

   Let T denotes the time to perform one computation of H.  [...]
               ^
It should say:

   Let T denote the time to perform one computation of H.  [...]


(9)  [ formatting issue ]

In Appendix C, the source text in the upper half of page 28
contains an improperly formatted comment -- obviously intended
to illustrate the subsequent declaration, the comment must be
aligned with that declaration.
Thus, the lines:

       // These are used to calculate the check-sum digits.
|      //                                0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
       private static final int[] doubleDigits =
                       { 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 };

should read:

       // These are used to calculate the check-sum digits.
|      //                0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
       private static final int[] doubleDigits =
                       { 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 };


(10)  [ further formatting (indentation) issues ]

Still in Appendix C, the source code on page 30 (lower half) and
page 31 contains improperly indented lines.
The following three line groups should be indented by 6 more character
positions to make them conformant to RFC style 'nice' format:

- on page 30:

     String result = null;
     int digits = addChecksum ? (codeDigits + 1) : codeDigits;

- on page 30:

     if ( (0<=truncationOffset) &&
            (truncationOffset<(hash.length-4)) ) {
         offset = truncationOffset;
     }

- on page 31:

     if (addChecksum) {
         otp =  (otp * 10) + calcChecksum(otp, codeDigits);
     }
     result = Integer.toString(otp);
     while (result.length() < digits) {
         result = "0" + result;
     }
     return result;


(11)  [ variation of item (3) above ]

The enumeration in Appendix E.4, on page 34, contains inconsistent
variable namings (cf. issue (3) above!).
To make it self-consistent, the enumeration:

   1) C-client >= C-server
   2) C-client - C-server <= s
   3) Check that HOTP client is valid HOTP(K,C-Client)
   4) If true, the server sets C to C-client + 1 and client is
      authenticated                           ^^^
                              ^^^             ^^^
should read:

   1) C-client >= C-server
   2) C-client - C-server <= s
|  3) Check that HOTP client is valid HOTP(K,C-client)
|  4) If true, the server sets C-server to C-client + 1 and client is
      authenticated


Authors, please verify, and decide whith of these issues should be
dealt with by an Errata Note.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,

studying the recently published RFC 4229 (HTTP Header Field
Registrations) authored by you, I found a couple of apparent
inconsistencies in the 'Status' and 'Specification Document'
entries for a few Header Fields.

Below, I make use of the reference tags from that RFC.


(1)

RFC 2109 [5] has been obsoleted by RFC 2965 [15], and the latter
apparently contains the current specification for the Set-Cookie
(and the Set-Cookie2) Header Field.

Nevertheless, the registration for 'Set-Cookie' in Subsection
2.1.96 of RFC 4229 (on page 36) refers to RFC 2109 [5] as the
normative Specification document.

I suspect that this particular Registration should be updated
immediately to point to RFC 2965 [15] .


(2)

RFC 2068 [4] has been obsoleted by RFC 2616 [11], and the latter
purposely has omitted a few elements of HTTP from the former
specification because of "detected problems" and/or "lack of
implementation" -- cf. Section 19.6 of RFC 2616.
Thus, there is no more current specification for these elements.
According to my understanding that means that these elements
effectively have been deprecated by RFC 2616.

Among those (deprecated) elements of HTTP 1.1 are the HTTP Header
Fields:
         -  Content-Base
         -  Content-Version
         -  Derived-From
         -  Keep-Alive
         -  Link
         -  Public
         -  URI

As expected, the Registrations for these HTTP Header Fields, as
presented in RFC 4229, consistently all refer to RFC 2068 [4] as
the (obsolete) 'Specification document' -- but, very surprisingly,
the registered 'Status' entries for these Header Fields all contain:
"standard" instead of "deprecated".

According to my understanding of IETF procedures, a feature or
protocol element must not be named "standard" if its specification
has been officially obsoleted / deprecated by a Standards Track RFC.

Hence, IMHO the IANA Registrations for the above mentioned HTTP
Header Fields (Subsections 2.1.{21,33,41,59,62,89,108} of RFC 4229
should be immediately corrected to contain 'Status: deprecated".

(Note: A status of "deprecated" still allows standards conformant
implementations to implement any such feature or protocol element
for the sake of backwards compatibility!)


I propose that you verify these two issues and take care of the
required updates to the IANA Registrations.  The posting of an
RFC Errata Note seems to be inappropriate in this particular case.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
reading the recently published RFC 4240 authored/edited by you
I found a couple of textual flaws -- ranging from simple typos
to more substantial issues.

I'll present these in (approximate) RFC text order, deliberately
using change bars, '|', in the first column and/or '^^^' / 'vvv'
style (up/down pointing) tags to point to offending locations
within the excerpts from the original text, and/or the proposed
modified text.


(1)  [ significant "character twister" ]

In Section 3.3., the text and example near the bottom of page 10
contain wrong escape sequences.  The correct ecsape sequence for
the value separator (equals sign) is %3d (or: %3D), not %d3 !
Therefore, the paragraphs,

   A number of MIME registrations, which could be used here, have
   parameters, for instance, video/DV.  To accommodate this, and retain
   compatibility with the SIP URI structure, the MIME-type parameter
|  separator (semicolon, %3b) and value separator (equal, %d3) MUST be
   escaped.  For example:                                 ^^^

   sip:annc@ms.example.net; \
       play=file://fs.example.net//clips/my-intro.dvi; \
|      content-type=video/mpeg%3bencode%d3314M-25/625-50
                                       ^^^
should correctly say:

   A number of MIME registrations, which could be used here, have
   parameters, for instance, video/DV.  To accommodate this, and retain
   compatibility with the SIP URI structure, the MIME-type parameter
|  separator (semicolon, %3b) and value separator (equal, %3d) MUST be
   escaped.  For example:

   sip:annc@ms.example.net; \
       play=file://fs.example.net//clips/my-intro.dvi; \
|      content-type=video/mpeg%3bencode%3d314M-25/625-50


(2)  [ minor textual improvement ]

In the final paragraph of section 3.3, on mid-page 11, perhaps
the words "most anything" should be replaced by "almost anything".


(3)  [ textual improvement ]

The last paragraph on page 12 (within Section 4.1.) apparently
contains a plural/singular inconsistency.
The text says:
                                         vvv                      vvv
   The media server presents the parameters as environment variables in
   the connection object.  Specifically, the parameter appears in the
   connection.sip tree.                             ^^^     ^^^

It should better say:

   The media server presents the parameters as environment variables in
|  the connection object.  Specifically, the parameters appear in the
   connection.sip tree.


(4)  [ inconsistent terminology ]

I suspect that section 5 contains an unintentional inconsistency
in the terminology used:
The syntax element represented by the 'uniqueIdentifier' part
of the example in the 9th line of Section 5 apparently is
referred to as the "conf-id value" in various places (once
on page 13, 11th text line from the bottom of the page, and
4 occurrences on page 14 (text lines 3, 9, 12, and 13).
But in the 'Formal Syntax' Section 5.2., this syntactic
element is named "instance-id" (see bottom of page 16).
It certainly would be preferrable to always use the same
terminology; you should decide which term should be used.


(5)  [ editorial artifact ]

The call flow diagram on page 15 unnecessarily 'overflows'
to page 16.  The two first text lines on page 16,

     |       |        |                  |                   |
     |       |        |                  |                   |

do not carry any useful information and might better have been
suppressed.


(6)  [ mismatch between diagram and explanation ]

Subsequently, near the top of page 16, the explanation of the
call flow diagram on page 15 says:

   Note that the above call flow does not show any 100 TRYING messages
   that would typically flow from the Application Server to the UACs;
   nor does it show the ACKs from the UACs to the Application Server or
   from the Application Server to the Media Server.

The latter is not true; the diagram in fact DOES show these ACKs !
Therefore, this paragraph should be shortened to just say:

   Note that the above call flow does not show any 100 TRYING messages
   that would typically flow from the Application Server to the UACs.


(7)  [ confusion between concrete and abstract parameter names ]

In the 'IANA Considerations' Section 6., on page 17, the
registered lines mix concrete (real) parameter names (like
'play') with the meta-parameter name 'extension' in a way
that might mislead the reader to taking 'extension' as a
concrete parameter name as well.
>From Section 3.3., it can clearly be seen that this is merely
a placeholder for any additional parameter that might be
standardized in the future.
I'm seriously in doubt whether it is a good idea to register
this meta-parameter.  Rather, future standards defining
concrete instances for the 'extension-param' should register
those concrete parameter names.

I therefore propose to delete the final line from the list,

   Parameter Name    Predefined Values    Reference
   --------------    -----------------    ---------
      .                      .               .

|  extension                 no           RFC 4240

and from the actual IANA registration performed.


(8)  [ legacy left in text? ]

The 3rd paragraph of Section 7, on page 17, says:

   This document explicitly addresses this issue.  The user names
   described in the text (namely annc, ivr, dialog, and conf) are
   available for whatever local use a given SIP user agent or proxy
   wishes for them.  [ ... ]

The user name, 'ivr', does not appear in the remainder of the text.
Admittedly omitting any detailed research, I suspect its occurrence
to be an improper left-over from earlier drafts.
Thus, this text should say:

   This document explicitly addresses this issue.  The user names
|  described in the text (namely annc, dialog, and conf) are
   available for whatever local use a given SIP user agent or proxy
   wishes for them.  [ ... ]


Please comment.
Some of these issues require your decision or action to be
resolved.  IMHO, most items should be considered for inclusion
in an RFC Errata Note.  Please make use of the material presented
above to directly submit an Author Errata Note or give me your
direction (and consent) to formally submit an Errata Note on my own.

Best Regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
after studying the recently published RFC 4319 authored by you
I'd like to report the textual issues I found in that memo.

I use change bars '|' in column 1 and '^^^' / 'vvv' style tags on
extar lines to emphasize the location of the textual issues and/or
the proposed corrections.
If necessary, I also have adjusted the line folding of proposed
text to keep it conformant with RFC formatting rules.


(1)

Apparently, Figure 2 on page 10 has not been adapted from RFC 3276
to remain aligned with the extensions covered by RFC 4319.
To keep the changes minimal, I propose to just amend the Figure
caption, replacing:

       Key:  <////> HDSL2/SHDSL span
             <~~~~> HDSL2/SHDSL segment
             =1=    HDSL2/SHDSL wire-pair-1
             =2=    SHDSL optional wire-pair-2 (Not applicable to HDSL2)
             C      Customer side segment endpoint (modem)
             N      Network side segment endpoint (modem)

by:

       Key:  <////> HDSL2/SHDSL span
             <~~~~> HDSL2/SHDSL segment
             =1=    HDSL2/SHDSL wire-pair-1
|            =2=    SHDSL optional wire-pair-2 (not applicable to HDSL2)
|                   and SHDSL.bis optional wire-pair-3 and wire-pair-4
|                   (not applicable to HDSL2 and 'classic' SHDSL)
             C      Customer side segment endpoint (modem)
             N      Network side segment endpoint (modem)


(2)

Section 2.7, on page 11, contains a bulleted list with two entries.
It turns out that the second (indented) paragraph of the 2nd bullet
in fact applies to both entries and hence should
  -  not be indented so much, and
  -  be adapted for plural grammar.
Thus, the paragraph saying:
                            vvv      vv
      The index value for this profile is a locally-unique
      administratively-assigned name for the profile having the textual
      convention 'SnmpAdminString' (RFC 3411 [RFC3411]).

should be modified to say:
                         vvv       vv
|  The index value for these profiles is a locally-unique
|  administratively-assigned name for the profile having the textual
|  convention 'SnmpAdminString' (RFC 3411 [RFC3411]).


(3)

The REVISION / DESCRIPTION clause pairs in MODULE-IDENTITY macro
invocations preferrably should be formulated in an 'update-friendly'
manner, i.e. such that the text does not need to be modified when
another revision of the MIB module is published in the future.

Therefore, I propose to change the DESCRIPTION clause for the
RFC 4319 revision of the HDSL2-SHDSL-LINE-MIB, at the bottom of
page 15 to follow this requirement.
The text there contains improper wording as well, the correction
of which justifies a combined Erratum entry.
Hence, the lines:

   REVISION    "200512070000Z" -- December 7, 2005
   DESCRIPTION "This version, published as RFC 4319.
         The following changes have been made in this version:
           1.  Added a 3rd and 4th wire pair.
           2.  Modified all rates such that their rates are only
               constrained by an unsigned 32-bit value and not by
               what today's perceived technology limitations are.

should be changed to say:

   REVISION    "200512070000Z" -- December 7, 2005
|  DESCRIPTION "Revised version, published as RFC 4319.
         The following changes have been made in this version:
           1.  Added a 3rd and 4th wire pair.
|          2.  Modified all rates such that they are only
               constrained by an unsigned 32-bit value and not by
               what today's perceived technology limitations are.


(3)

On page 16 (lower half), the 2nd paragraph of the DESCRIPTION clause
of the Hdsl2ShdslPerfCurrDayCount TEXTUAL-CONVENTION contains a mis-
spelled syntax name (of another TEXTUAL-CONVENTION).

The sentence,

                                [ ... ]  At that time, the value of the
         gauge is stored in the previous 1-day history interval, as
         defined in a companion object of type
         Hdsl2Shdsl1DayIntevalCount, and the current interval gauge
         is restarted at zero.

should say:

                                [ ... ]  At that time, the value of the
         gauge is stored in the previous 1-day history interval, as
         defined in a companion object of type
|        Hdsl2Shdsl1DayIntervalCount, and the current interval gauge
         is restarted at zero.
                           ^


(4)

On page 17 (lower half), the DESCRIPTION clause of the
Hdsl2ShdslPerfIntervalThreshold TEXTUAL-CONVENTION suffers from the
lack of a verb in its 2nd sentence.
The paragraph,

        "This convention defines a range of values that may be set in
         a fault threshold alarm control.  As the number of seconds in
         a 15-minute interval numbers at most 900, objects of this type
         may have a range of 0...900, where the value of 0 disables the
         alarm."

should say:

        "This convention defines a range of values that may be set in
         a fault threshold alarm control.  As the number of seconds in
|        a 15-minute interval numbers is at most 900, objects of this
         type may have a range of 0...900, where the value of 0 disables
         the alarm."


(5)

On page 18, there is a word omission in the DESCRIPTION clause of the
Hdsl2ShdslWirePair TEXTUAL-CONVENTION.
The paragraph,

        "This is the referenced pair of wires in an HDSL2/SHDSL segment.
         HDSL2 only supports a single pair (wirePair1 or two wire),
         SHDSL lines support an optional second pair (wirePair2 or four
         wire), and G.shdsl.bis support an optional third pair
         (wirePair3 or six wire) and an optional fourth pair
         (wirePair4 or eight wire)."

should say:

        "This is the referenced pair of wires in an HDSL2/SHDSL segment.
         HDSL2 only supports a single pair (wirePair1 or two wire),
         SHDSL lines support an optional second pair (wirePair2 or four
|        wire), and G.shdsl.bis lines support an optional third pair
         (wirePair3 or six wire) and an optional fourth pair
         (wirePair4 or eight wire)."


(6)

On pages 45..49 it would be very useful to have REFERENCE clauses
added to the OBJECT-TYPE declarations for the technology specific
objects in the Span Configuration Profile Table (similarly to what
has been done for the OBJECT-TYPE declarations for the objects in
the Unit Inventory Group, on pp. 24..27).


(7)

The DESCRIPTION clause of the hdsl2ShdslSpanConfMinLineRate OBJECT-
TYPE declaration contains a reference to a truncated object name.

That clause says:

        "This object configures the minimum transmission rate for
         the associated SHDSL Line in bits-per-second (bps) and includes
         both payload (user data) and any applicable framing overhead.
         If the minimum line rate equals the maximum line rate
         (hdsl2ShdslSpanMaxLineRate), the line rate is considered
         'fixed'.  If the minimum line rate is less than the
         maximum line rate, the line rate is considered
         'rate-adaptive'."

It should say:

        "This object configures the minimum transmission rate for
         the associated SHDSL Line in bits-per-second (bps) and includes
         both payload (user data) and any applicable framing overhead.
         If the minimum line rate equals the maximum line rate
|        (hdsl2ShdslSpanConfMaxLineRate), the line rate is considered
         'fixed'.  If the minimum line rate is less than the
         maximum line rate, the line rate is considered
         'rate-adaptive'."


(8)

The DESCRIPTION clauses of OBJECT-TYPE declarations preferrably
should be 'self-centric', i.e. describe context as seen from
the respective object. Therefore, text replications from one object
to another object without proper adaptation are sub-optimal, at best.
In particular, referencing an object within its DESCRIPTION clause
by name, while omitting to call another object (referenced there)
by its name does not add much to the clarity of the DESCRIPTION.

Therefore, I propose to slightly modify the DESCRIPTION clause of
the hdsl2ShdslSpanConfMaxLineRate OBJECT-TYPE declaration, on top
of page 46.  This clause is affected by issue (7) as well.

The clause says:

        "This object configures the maximum transmission rate for
         the associated SHDSL Line in bits-per-second (bps) and includes
         both payload (user data) and any applicable framing overhead.
         If the minimum line rate equals the maximum line rate
         (hdsl2ShdslSpanMaxLineRate), the line rate is considered
         'fixed'.  If the minimum line rate is less than the
         maximum line rate, the line rate is considered
         'rate-adaptive'."

It better should say:

        "This object configures the maximum transmission rate for
         the associated SHDSL Line in bits-per-second (bps) and includes
         both payload (user data) and any applicable framing overhead.
|        If the minimum line rate (hdsl2ShdslSpanConfMinLineRate) equals
|        the maximum line rate the line rate is considered 'fixed'.
         If the minimum line rate is less than the maximum line rate,
         the line rate is considered 'rate-adaptive'."


(9)

On pages 47/48, the DESCRIPTION clauses for the four objects:
    hdsl2ShdslSpanConfCurrCondTargetMarginDown,
    hdsl2ShdslSpanConfWorstCaseTargetMarginDown,
    hdsl2ShdslSpanConfCurrCondTargetMarginUp,  and
    hdsl2ShdslSpanConfWorstCaseTargetMarginUp
contain mainly identical text.  This emphasizes the similarities
between these objects but leaves the reader alone as to the use and
differing purpose of the objects.  It would be very desirable to
have additional expanatory text added to these four descriptions
to clarify the intended use (e.g., as an alarm limit).



IMHO, most of these issues are worth of being considered for
inclusion in an Errata Note to be posted on the RFC Editor's web
site.  Of cause, things like item (9) might as well just be noted
for consideration at the time of the next update (if any ...).

Please comment, and either deliberately make use of the above
material to directly submit such Errata Note, or give me direction
as to what would obtain your (the author's) consent if formally
submitted by me.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,

after studying the recently published RFC 4312 (Camellia with IPsec)
authored by you, I'd like to submit a few comments, mostly on the
References listed on page 6 of the RFC.

RFC 4312 apparently has been published a bit later than, but
closely coordinated with, the new IPsec document suite (RFC 430x).

Accordingly, the Normative Reference [ESP] of RFC 4312 points to
the new ESP RFC 4303, as expected.

But surprisingly, the Informative References are not updated
similarly.
I would have expected [ARCH] pointing to RFC 4301 (that has
obsoleted RFC 2401), and at least an additional Ref. to IKEv2
(RFC 4306, which substantially amends/updates the old RFC 2409
[IKE]) -- with title and text of Section 4 slightly adapted.
The current text and Ref. [IKE] even might lead to the mis-
conception that the Camellia cipher would not be suitable for
use with IKEv2 (a statement certainly not intended by you).

Finally, the URI given in Ref. [CRYPTREC] contains a spurious
blank character after the last "/".


Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
I would like to draw your attention to a few small issues I found
in the recently published RFC 4309 authored by you.  (These are
strictly textual and formatting flaws only.)


(1)  [word omissions - and opportunity to simplify the text]

On page 6, the second paragraph of Section 5 says:

   Sequence Numbers are conveyed canonical network byte order.  Extended
   Sequence Numbers are conveyed canonical network byte order, placing
   the high-order 32 bits first and the low-order 32 bits second.
   Canonical network byte order is fully described in RFC 791, Appendix
   B.

The text should perhaps better say:

   Sequence Numbers are conveyed in canonical network byte order.
   Extended Sequence Numbers are conveyed in canonical network byte
   order, placing the high-order 32 bits first and the low-order 32 bits
   second.  Canonical network byte order is fully described in RFC 791,
   Appendix B.

The second half-sentence of the second sentence might even be considered
redundant, fully comprised by the term 'canonical network byte order',
and hence be omitted entirely.  Doing that, and following the maxim of
"making RFC text as simple as possible", the above text might be
abreviated to say:

   Sequence Numbers and Extended Sequence Numbers are conveyed in
   canonical network byte order.  Canonical network byte order is fully
   described in RFC 791, Appendix B.

Finally, considering that the SPI is a 32-bit number and covered by
the same ordering rule as well, the text might - even shorter - say:

   All fields are conveyed in canonical network byte order.  Canonical
   network byte order is fully described in RFC 791, Appendix B.

Please decide whether the initial text correction deserves an
Errata Note, possibly including the additional enhancement(s).


(2)  [spurious blank lines]

Like other contemporary RFCs, RFC 4309 suffers from a few spurious
blank lines inserted in the middle of sentences (on pp. 3, 9).
I already occasionally have communicated to the RFC Editor my
(subjective) conjecture that this flaw might be an artifact of
tools used in the transformation process fron I-D to RFC.


Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,

studying the recently published RFC 4307 (Algorithms for IKEv2)
authored by you, I found a significant issue with the text, and
a minor formatting flaw as well.


(1)  [typo breaking IPsec terminology]

On pages 3 and 4 of RFC 4307, the text in Section 3.1.3 through
Section 3.1.5 contains three instances of the same typo,
talking about    [algorithms of] "Transfer Type <n>"  , where it
should refer to  [algorithms of] "Transform Type <n>" .

This breaks the systematic IPsec terminology and should, IMHO,
be addressed by an RFC Errata Note as follows.  (If you agree,
please state your consent in a message to the RFC-Ed.)


----------  snip  ------------

(a) Section 3.1.3, on page 3 of RFC 4307, says:

   IKEv2 defines several possible algorithms for Transfer Type 1
   (encryption).  These are defined below with their implementation
   status.

It should say:

   IKEv2 defines several possible algorithms for Transform Type 1
   (encryption).  These are defined below with their implementation
   status.

(b) Section 3.1.4, on page 3 of RFC 4307, says:

   Transfer Type 2 Algorithms are pseudo-random functions used to
   generate random values when needed.

It should say:

   Transform Type 2 Algorithms are pseudo-random functions used to
   generate random values when needed.

(c) Section 3.1.5, on page 4 of RFC 4307, says:

   Transfer Type 3 Algorithms are Integrity algorithms used to protect
   data against tampering.

It should say:

   Transform Type 3 Algorithms are Integrity algorithms used to protect
   data against tampering.

----------  snip  ------------



(2)  [spurious blank line]

Like other contemporary RFCs, RFC 4307 seems to have been infected
by a common 'virus'.
In the case or RFC 4307, the first sentence of the Introduction has
been inadvertantly split by a spurious blank line.

I already occasionally have communicated my (subjective) conjecture
that this common flaw might be an artifact of tools used in the
transformation process from I-D to RFC.

[ RFC-Ed:
  I apologize for having repeated similar notes in various comments
  on different RFCs.  But I have still a significant backlog of RFCs
  on my desk (waiting for comments to be typed, cross-checked and
  sent), with similar pencil side notes on many of them.  I firmly
  promise to refrain from including this issue over and over again. ]


Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
I'd like to report a few issues I've found reading the
recently published RFC 4352 (AMR-WB+ over RTP) authored
by you.


(1)  [typo in formula]

In Section 4.3.2.3 of RFC 4352, the first formula line on page 18,

      TS(i) = TS(i-1) + (DISi + 1) * frame duration,    2 < i < n

inadvertently excludes the cases i=2 and i=n, which thus remain
unspecified.
The text should say:

      TS(i) = TS(i-1) + (DISi + 1) * frame duration,    2 <= i <= n


(2)  [clarification]

The 'Example Algorithm' in Section 4.5.1, on page 27, in the
second half of Step 1, says:

   Return recovered timestamps as
   x(n) = t0 + n*L1 and associated ISF equal to isf0,
   for 0 < n < (t1 - t0)/L0
   goto End

IMHO, the "n*L1" in the second line above comes surprisingly and
should better be replaced by "n*L0" for the sake of consistency.
("L1" is not strictly wrong in that place: from the applicable
preconditions, it can be derived that L1 == L0 whenever the
above lines of pseudocode get executed.  But using "L0" instead
of "L1" would certainly enhance the readability because the
intrinsically related value of isf0 appears in the same line,
and in the next line the corresponding division is performed
by L0 as well.)
Furthermore, the intended structure of the above code fragment
could perhaps be better visualized by reversing the order of the
lines with the loop control statement and the body of the loop,
and make use of indentation for the latter.
To sum up, I propose this enhanced version:

   for 0 < n < (t1 - t0)/L0
      Return recovered timestamps as
      x(n) = t0 + n*L0 and associated ISF equal to isf0
   goto End


(3)  [clash in terminology]

In Section 7.2, on page 32, the itemized list presented starts
with:

   -  The media type ("audio") is used in SDP "m=" as the media name.

   -  The media type (payload format name) is used in SDP "a=rtpmap" as
      the encoding name.  [...]

Obviously, the second appearance of 'media type' does not refer
to the 'media type ("audio")' from the first line, but to what
usually is referred to by the term 'media subtype'.
Therefore, the above text should better say:

   -  The media type ("audio") is used in SDP "m=" as the media name.

   -  The media subtype (payload format name) is used in SDP "a=rtpmap"
      as the encoding name.  [...]


(4)  [appropriate wording]

Within the second paragraph on page 33, Section 7.2.1 of RFC 4352
says:
                                            [...]  As any receiver will
      be capable of receiving stereo frame type and perform local mixing
      within the AMR-WB+ decoder, there is normally only one reason to
      restrict to mono only: to avoid spending bit-rate on data that are
      not utilized if the front-end is only capable of mono.

It apparently should better have 'stereo frame type' replaced by
'stereo frame types', saying (with line wrapping re-adjusted to RFC
formatting rules):
                                               v
                                                   As any receiver will
|     be capable of receiving stereo frame types and perform local
      mixing within the AMR-WB+ decoder, there is normally only one
      reason to restrict to mono only: to avoid spending bit-rate on
      data that are not utilized if the front-end is only capable of
      mono.


IMHO, it would be appropriate to make the knowledge of these issues
available to other readers of the RFC, by posting of an Errata Note
to the RFC Editor's web site.
If you prefer to submit an Author's Errata Note, please make use
of the material presented above.  Otherwise, if you agree, I will
reformat it (stripping expanatory text) and submit it directly.

Additionally, I have found a few minor 'language/grammar' flaws not
mentioned above.  The details might be of interest to you should
ever an update of that RFC be intended.  Please let me know if you
are interested in getting these details for internal notice now.

BTW: I have sent today another message to the author of RFC 4348,
pointing to issues resulting from text apparently being borrowed
from RFC 4352 without proper adaptation to the particularities
of the VMR-WB RTP payload.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Dear RFC-Editor, 

I would like to submit the following errata for RFC 4227.
If was first reported to us by Alfred Hînes with helpful comments by Philip
Nesser.

Thanks,

Eamon O'Tuathail

------------------------------------

In Section 6.1.1, it says:

     If the authority component contains a domain name and a port number,
     e.g.,

        soap.beep://stockquoteserver.example.com:1026

     then the DNS is queried for the A Resource Records corresponding to
     the domain name, and the port number is used directly.

     If the authority component contains a domain name and no port number,
     e.g.,

         soap.beep://stockquoteserver.example.com

     the Service Record algorithm [11] is used with a service parameter of
     "soap-beep" and a protocol parameter of "tcp" to determine the IP/TCP
     addressing information.  If no appropriate SRV RRs are found (e.g.,
     for "_soap-beep._tcp.stockquoteserver.example.com"), then the DNS is
     queried for the A RRs corresponding to the domain name and the port
     number used is assigned by the IANA for the registration in Section
     8.4.

It should say:

     If the authority component contains a domain name and a port number,
     e.g.,

       	soap.beep://stockquoteserver.example.com:1026

     then the DNS is queried for the Address Records (i.e. "A" for
     IPv4, "AAAA" for IPv6 based on the host resolver specifications) 
     corresponding to the domain name, and the port number is used directly.

     If the authority component contains a domain name and no port number,
     e.g.,

           soap.beep://stockquoteserver.example.com

     the Service Record algorithm [11] is used with a service parameter of
     "soap-beep" and a protocol parameter of "tcp" to determine the IP/TCP
     addressing information.  If no appropriate SRV RRs are found (e.g.,
     for "_soap-beep._tcp.stockquoteserver.example.com"), then the DNS is
     queried for the Address RRs corresponding to the domain name     
     and the port number used is assigned by the IANA for the registration
     in Section 8.4.



In section 9, it says:

   Although service provisioning is a policy matter, at a minimum, all
   implementations MUST provide the following tuning profiles:

   for authentication: http://iana.org/beep/SASL/DIGEST-MD5

   for confidentiality: http://iana.org/beep/TLS (using the
      TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_EDE_CBC_SHA cipher)

   for both: http://iana.org/beep/TLS (using the
      TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_EDE_CBC_SHA cipher supporting client-side
      certificates)

It should say:

   Although service provisioning is a policy matter, at a minimum, all
   implementations MUST provide the following tuning profiles:

   for authentication: http://iana.org/beep/SASL/DIGEST-MD5

   for confidentiality: http://iana.org/beep/TLS (using the
      TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA cipher)

   for both: http://iana.org/beep/TLS (using the
      TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA cipher supporting client-side
      certificates)

comibnation of upper and lower case, such as "NETASCII", "NetAscii", etc.)

combination of upper and lower case, such as "NETASCII", "NetAscii", etc.) 
in netascii indicating the three modes defined in the protocol.

Hello,
in the recently published RFC 4327 authored by you, I have
found a couple of textual flaws, mainly in the DESCRIPTION
clauses of the LMP MIB module.
Most of these issues should be covered by an RFC errata note.
(Please comment.)

I present the issues in textual order, pointing back to the
first occurrence in case of multiple similar flaws.
To facilitate locating of clauses in the MIB module,
I have often included below the object name in the headline
and the (symbolic) OID of the object definition in the text
fragment cited.
Change bars '|' in column 1 and lines with '^^^' / 'vvv' tags
have freely been included to point to the proposed changes.


(1)  [plaintext flaw]

In the final paragraph of Section 7, on page 8, RFC 4327 says:

   In parallel with the entry created in the lmpTeLinkTable, an entry
   may be created in the teLinkTable of TE Link MIB module
   [RFC4220].

It should better say:

   In parallel with the entry created in the lmpTeLinkTable, an entry
|  may be created in the teLinkTable of the TE Link MIB module
   [RFC4220].
                                       ^^^^^

(2)  [plaintext flaw]

In the second paragraph of Section 8, at the bottom of page 8,
RFC 4327 says:

                        [...].  The interrelation of entries in the
   ifTable is defined by Interfaces Stack Group defined in [RFC2863].

It should say:

                        [...].  The interrelation of entries in the
|  ifTable is defined by the Interfaces Stack Group defined in
   [RFC2863].
                        ^^^^^


(3)  LmpInterval TEXTUAL-CONVENTION  (page 12)

The clause,

   DESCRIPTION
       "The interval delay in milliseconds."

perhaps should better say:

   DESCRIPTION
|      "The delay interval in milliseconds."

or even:

   DESCRIPTION
|      "The interval period for a periodically performed LMP operation,
|       in milliseconds."


(4)  LmpRetransmitInterval TEXTUAL-CONVENTION  (page 12)

The clause,

   DESCRIPTION
       "The retransmission interval delay in milliseconds."

perhaps should better say:

   DESCRIPTION
|      "The retransmission delay interval in milliseconds."

or even better:

   DESCRIPTION
|      "The (initial) retransmission interval in milliseconds."


(5)  lmpNbrRetransmitInterval OBJECT-TYPE  (page 14)

The sentence in the DESCRIPTION clause,

   "[...]  This object ... is used to implement congestion-handling
   mechanism as defined in Section 10 of the Link Management Protocol
   specification, which is based on RFC 2914."

should perhaps better say:
                                               vvvvv
|  "[...]  This object ... is used to implement the congestion-handling
   mechanism as defined in Section 10 of the Link Management Protocol
   specification, which is based on RFC 2914."


(6)  lmpNbrRetryLimit OBJECT-TYPE  (page 14)

The correction from item (5) above should be applied here as well.


(7)  lmpCcRemoteAddressType OBJECT-TYPE  (page 20)

   DESCRIPTION
       "This value represents the remote control channel IP address
        type.  In point-to-point configuration, this value can be set
        to unknown(0)."
   ::= { lmpControlChannelEntry 6 }

should better say:

   DESCRIPTION
       "This value represents the remote control channel IP address
|       type.  In point-to-point configurations, this value can be set
        to unknown(0)."
   ::= { lmpControlChannelEntry 6 }
                                              ^

[ The possible alternative, "In a point-to-point configuration, ..."
  is not proposed here, to maintain a style similar to the minimal
  change for the next object -- see (8) below.]


(8)  lmpCcRemoteIpAddr OBJECT-TYPE  (page 20)

   DESCRIPTION
       "[...]
        Control channel must be numbered on non-point-to-point
        configuration.  For point-to-point configuration, the
        remote control channel address can be of type unknown
        in which case this object must be a zero-length string.  The
        lmpCcRemoteId object then identifies the unnumbered
        address."
   ::= { lmpControlChannelEntry 7 }

should better say:

   DESCRIPTION
       "[...]
|       The control channel must be numbered on non-point-to-point
|       configurations.  For point-to-point configurations, the
        remote control channel address can be of type unknown
        in which case this object must be a zero-length string.  The
        lmpCcRemoteId object then identifies the unnumbered
        address."
   ::= { lmpControlChannelEntry 7 }


(9)  lmpCcHelloInterval OBJECT-TYPE  (page 21)

An established 'default' specifies the value of a (newly created)
tabular object to be used when this object is not SET explicitely.
Hence,

   DESCRIPTION
       "This object specifies the value of the HelloInterval
        parameter.  The default value for this object should be
        set to lmpCcHelloIntervalDefault."
   ::= { lmpControlChannelEntry 10 }

should better say:

   DESCRIPTION
       "This object specifies the value of the HelloInterval
|       parameter.  The default value to be used for this object
|       is lmpCcHelloIntervalDefault."
   ::= { lmpControlChannelEntry 10 }


(9')   lmpCcHelloIntervalMin OBJECT-TYPE  (page 21) ,
(9'')  lmpCcHelloIntervalMax OBJECT-TYPE  (page 21/22) ,
(10)   lmpCcHelloDeadInterval OBJECT-TYPE  (page 22) ,
(10')  lmpCcHelloDeadIntervalMin OBJECT-TYPE  (page 22) , and
(10'') lmpCcHelloDeadIntervalMax OBJECT-TYPE  (page 22)

The change from item (9) above should be applied there similarly:

Replace the phrase,

           "[...].  The default value for this object should be
        set to lmp<*>Default."

by:

|          "[...].  The default value to be used for this object
|       is lmp<*>Default."

using, at all instances, the appropriate value for the placeholder <*>.


(11)  lmpControlChannelPerfEntry OBJECT-TYPE  (page 24)

   DESCRIPTION
       "An entry in this table is created by a LMP-enabled device for
        every control channel.  lmpCcCounterDiscontinuityTime is used
        to indicate potential discontinuity for all counter objects
        in this table."

The latter is not true.
In this MIB module, the discontinuity is monitored per table *entry*
(conceptual row), not for the table as a whole -- see the DESCRIPTIONs
for lmp<*>DiscontinuityTime later in the RFC.

Therefore, the above clause should say:

   DESCRIPTION
       "An entry in this table is created by a LMP-enabled device for
        every control channel.  lmpCcCounterDiscontinuityTime is used
        to indicate potential discontinuity for all counter objects
|       in this entry (conceptual row)."


(12)  lmpCcChannelStatusAckSent OBJECT-TYPE  (page 34)

The clause,

   DESCRIPTION
       "This object counts the number of ChannelStatus messages
        that have been sent on this control channel."
   ::= { lmpControlChannelPerfEntry 47 }

refers to the wrong message type; it should say:

   DESCRIPTION
|      "This object counts the number of ChannelStatusAck messages
        that have been sent on this control channel."
   ::= { lmpControlChannelPerfEntry 47 }


(13)  lmpTeLinkEntry OBJECT-TYPE  (page 36)

The DESCRIPTION clause contains the sentence:

                                                      [...].  The
        administrative status value is controlled from the ifEntry.
        [...]

This sentence should say:

                                                      [...].  The
|       administrative status is controlled from the ifEntry.
        [...]


(14)  lmpTeLinkPerfEntry OBJECT-TYPE  (page 42)

The correction from item (11) above is to be applied here as well:

Replace:

   DESCRIPTION
       "An entry in this table is created by an LMP-enabled device for
        every TE link.  lmpTeCounterDiscontinuityTime is used
        to indicate potential discontinuity for all counter objects
        in this table."

by:

   DESCRIPTION
       "An entry in this table is created by an LMP-enabled device for
        every TE link.  lmpTeCounterDiscontinuityTime is used
        to indicate potential discontinuity for all counter objects
|       in this entry (conceptual row)."


(15)  lmpTeEndVerifyRetransmit OBJECT-TYPE  (page 45/46)

   DESCRIPTION
       "This object counts the number of EndVerify messages that
        have been retransmitted over this control channel."
   ::= { lmpTeLinkPerfEntry 12 }

is inappropriate.  In accordance with the text supplied for the
other objects in the LMP TE Link Performance Table, it should say:

   DESCRIPTION
       "This object counts the number of EndVerify messages that
|       have been retransmitted for this TE link."
   ::= { lmpTeLinkPerfEntry 12 }


(16)  lmpTeTestStatusFailureRetransmit OBJECT-TYPE  (page 47)

   DESCRIPTION
       "This object counts the number of TestStatusFailure messages
        that have been retransmitted on this TE link."
   ::= { lmpTeLinkPerfEntry 20 }

should say:

   DESCRIPTION
       "This object counts the number of TestStatusFailure messages
        that have been retransmitted for this TE link."
   ::= { lmpTeLinkPerfEntry 20 }

[ According to Section 12.5.8. of the LMP specification [RFC 4204],
  LMP TestStatusFailure messages are transmitted over the control
  channel; hence, "retransmitted *on* this TE Link" is wrong! ]


(17)  lmpTeLinkSummaryRetransmit OBJECT-TYPE  (page 48)

The correction from item (15) above is to be applied here as well:

Replace:

   DESCRIPTION
       "This object counts the number of LinkSummary messages that
        have been retransmitted over this control channel."
   ::= { lmpTeLinkPerfEntry 25 }

by:

   DESCRIPTION
       "This object counts the number of LinkSummary messages that
|       have been retransmitted for this TE link."
   ::= { lmpTeLinkPerfEntry 25 }


(18)  lmpTeChannelStatusAckSent OBJECT-TYPE  (page 50)

The correction from item (12) above is to be applied here as well:

Replace:

   DESCRIPTION
       "This object counts the number of ChannelStatus messages
        that have been sent for this TE link."
   ::= { lmpTeLinkPerfEntry 34 }

by:

   DESCRIPTION
|      "This object counts the number of ChannelStatusAck messages
        that have been sent for this TE link."
   ::= { lmpTeLinkPerfEntry 34 }


(19)  lmpDataLinkEntry OBJECT-TYPE  (page 51)

The correction from item (13) above is to be applied here as well:

The sentence in the DESCRIPTION clause,

                   [...].  The administrative status value is
        controlled from the ifEntry.  [...]

should say:

|                  [...].  The administrative value is
        controlled from the ifEntry.  [...]


(20)  lmpDataLinkPerfEntry OBJECT-TYPE  (page 55)

The correction from item (11) above is to be applied here as well:

Replace:

   DESCRIPTION
       "An entry in this table contains information about
        the LMP performance counters for the data-bearing links.
        lmpDataLinkDiscontinuityTime is used to indicate potential
        discontinuity for all counter objects in this table."

by:

   DESCRIPTION
       "An entry in this table contains information about
        the LMP performance counters for the data-bearing links.
        lmpDataLinkDiscontinuityTime is used to indicate potential
|       discontinuity for all counter objects in this entry."


(21)  lmpNotificationMaxRate OBJECT-TYPE  (page 57/58)

The DESCRIPTION text near the top of page 58 says:

                        [...].  For instance, a network of 100 nodes
        with 5 links of 128 wavelengths each and a link verification
        of 1 minute with no more than 10% of the links failed at any
        given time would have 1 notification per second sent from
        each node, or 100 notifications per second for the whole
        network.  The rest of the notifications are negligible
        compared to this number.

        To alleviate the congestion problem, the
        lmpNotificationMaxRate object can be used to implement a
        throttling mechanism.  It is also possible to enable/disable
        certain type of notifications.

It should say, correcting two flaws (line breaks adjusted):

                        [...].  For instance, a network of 100 nodes
        with 5 links of 128 wavelengths each and a link verification
|       interval of 1 minute with no more than 10% of the links failed
        at any given time would have 1 notification per second sent
        from each node, or 100 notifications per second for the whole
        network.  The rest of the notifications are negligible
        compared to this number.

        To alleviate the congestion problem, the
        lmpNotificationMaxRate object can be used to implement a
        throttling mechanism.  It is also possible to enable/disable
|       certain types of notifications.


(22)  lmpNodeGroup OBJECT-GROUP  (page 71/72)

Near the top of page 72, the RFC says:

   DESCRIPTION
          "Collection of objects that represent LMP node
           configuration."
   ::= { lmpGroups 1 }

It should say:

   DESCRIPTION
|         "Collection of objects that represents the LMP node
           configuration."
   ::= { lmpGroups 1 }

[ In fact, it is *the collection* (singular) that represents
  the node configuration! ]


(23)  lmpControlChannelGroup OBJECT-GROUP  (page 72)

At the bottom of page 72, the RFC says:

   DESCRIPTION
          "Objects that can be used to configure LMP interface."

It should say:

   DESCRIPTION
|         "Objects that can be used to configure LMP interfaces."


(24)  lmpDataLinkGroup OBJECT-GROUP  (page 76)

Similar to item (22) above, the clause,

   DESCRIPTION
          "Collection of objects that represent data-bearing link
           configuration."
   ::= { lmpGroups 9 }

should better say:

   DESCRIPTION
          "Collection of objects that represents data-bearing link
           configurations."
   ::= { lmpGroups 9 }

Hello,

I just read the recently published RFC 4384 (= BCP 114)
authored by you, and would like to draw your attention to
a few flaws of that memo.


(1)

RFC 4384, in the table legend on page 6, and in Section 6,
at the bottom of page 9, refers to ISO 3166-2 for numeric
country codes.  This is not correct.

ISO 3166-2 specifies codes for *subdivisions* of countries,
e.g. the States of the U.S.A., or the provinces of Canada.

The numeric Country Codes apparently used in RFC 4384 in fact
are defined and maintained as a part of ISO 3166-1 !
That Standard contains 3 tables: 2-character, 3-character,
and numeric Country Codes.  Unfortunately, only the first
table (also used for ccTLDs in the DNS) is made publicly
(online) available by ISO; apparently this has generally
raised the impression that ISO 3166-1 just comprised that
single table.  (This might have been the background for
mentioning ISO 3166-2 in the RFC.)

ISO certainly would appreciate if many people bought the
ISO 3166-2 database when looking for the numeric country
codes, but probably neither ISOC/IETF nor the RFC author
would be participating in such earnings of ISO  :-)

Therefore, I propose to correct this flaw by means of an
RFC Errata Note, as follows:


RFC 4384, on mid-page 6, says:

    <CC> is the 10-bit ISO-3166-2 country code [ISO3166]

Where it should say:

    <CC> is the 10-bit ISO-3166-1 country code [ISO3166]
                               ^^^

Accordingly, the final sentence of Section 6, on page 9,
saying:

                             [...].  Henk Uijterwaal suggested the use
   of the ISO-3166-2 country codes.

should say:

                             [...].  Henk Uijterwaal suggested the use
   of the ISO-3166-1 numeric country codes.
                   ^^^^^^^^^


(2)

According to the explanation in Section 3 (page 5), the <Value>
filed is 16 bit wide, and the last sentence on page 5 in Section 4
emphasized the split format "<AS>:<Value>".  (The references to
<Value> in section 4.1 are consistent with that terminology.)

Therefore, in the table on page 6, the "<AS>:" leaders in the
column titled "Value" are inappropriate.
Perhaps, a 'minimally invasive' correction should modify the
headline, not the table entries:

The headline of the table on page 6,

       Category                                 Value

should say:

       Category                              <AS>:<Value>


(3)

The encoding diagram in section 4.2, on page 9, apparently
contains the concrete sample value, '0x10F2' (from the
immediately preceding example in Section 4.1), where it
probably should contain the abstract notion "<Value>".
The literal encoding as presented is misleading, hence
the following correction seems to be appropriate:

RFC 4384, in section 4.2 on page 9 contains the diagram:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |      0x02     |    0x0008     |    Global Administrator       |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     | Global Administrator (cont.)  |           0x10F2              |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

This diagram should say:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |      0x02     |    0x0008     |    Global Administrator       |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     | Global Administrator (cont.)  |           <Value>             |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


(4)

RFC 4384 makes a Normative Reference to RFC 1771.
But, almost 3 weeks ahead of the publication of RFC 4384,
RFC 1771 has been obsoleted by RFC 4271.

Has this obsolete reference been made intentionally (I cannot
see any immediate reason for doing so) -- or is it just an
editorial oversight?

  Alfred HÎnes

Hello,
reading the recently published RFC 4360 authored by you I found
an inconsistency (or logical gap) that should be resolved:

Section 3.1. defines the Extended Community extended type classes
0x00ss and 0x40ss, as does Section 3.2. for the type classes 0x01ss
and 0x41ss, and Section 3.3. for the type classes 0x03ss and 0x43ss
(where 'ss' is the Sub-Type).
These classes are also covered by the IANA Considerations section.

Section 4. and Section 5. of RFC 4360 both define extended types
where "the value of the high-order octet of the Type field ... can
be 0x00, 0x01, or 0x02".
There is no formal definition for the latter case, Type = 0x02ss,
in the whole RFC, and the subtypes 0x0202 and 0x0203 are not covered
by the IANA considerations section.
>From text in Section 4. and 5., it can be concluded, that perhaps
the layout from Section 3.1. should be applicable in this case as
well, but that's all I could find!

Was type 0x02ss deprecated during the evolution of the draft,
or has the definition of that extended type been ommitted
accidentially from the RFC ????

Please comment!


Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
this is one of a couple of messages being prepared with comments
on the new basic IPsec RFCs, RFC 430{1,2,3,6}; it deals with the
new AH specification, RFC 4302.

I have found only a few minor textual and editorial issues with
this document.
Therefore, you just might make note of [most of] the subsequent
remarks for use when preparing the next update of the documant
(if any).


(1)

RFC 4301, in section 13, "Differences from RFC 2401", in the
second bulleted item (near the top of page 73) states:

   o There is no longer a requirement to support nested SAs or "SA
     bundles".  [...]

And later on, on page 74:

   o Support for AH in both IPv4 and IPv6 is no longer required.

Therefore, the paragraph on page 10 of RFC 4302,

   ESP and AH headers can be combined in a variety of modes.  The IPsec
   Architecture document describes the combinations of security
   associations that must be supported.
                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
entails more or less a "NOPE".  If something like the second
sentence is still desired, it might better say, e.g.,

   ESP and AH headers can be combined in a variety of modes.  The IPsec
   Architecture document briefly describes the methods to configure
   such combinations of security associations.


(2)

On page 25, Appendix A1 presents a table classifying the IPv4 options.
Within that table, the second column is partially misaligned.


(3)

On page 26, the table within Appendix A2 classifying the IPv6
extension headers,

       Option/Extension Name                  Reference
       -----------------------------------    ---------
       MUTABLE BUT PREDICTABLE -- included in ICV calculation
         Routing (Type 0)                    [DH98]

       BIT INDICATES IF OPTION IS MUTABLE (CHANGES UNPREDICTABLY DURING
       TRANSIT)
         Hop-by-Hop options                  [DH98]
         Destination options                 [DH98]

       NOT APPLICABLE
         Fragmentation                       [DH98]

perhaps would have better been formatted like:

       Option/Extension Name                  Reference
       -----------------------------------    ---------
       MUTABLE BUT PREDICTABLE
       -- included in ICV calculation
         Routing (Type 0)                       [DH98]

       BIT INDICATES IF OPTION IS MUTABLE
       (CHANGES UNPREDICTABLY DURING TRANSIT)
         Hop-by-Hop options                     [DH98]
         Destination options                    [DH98]

       NOT APPLICABLE
         Fragmentation                          [DH98]

to avoid the overlap of the columns.


(4)

In Appendix B2.1, at one place on page 30, the variable
"seqh" is mis-spelled as "seqH" (this is in the 6th-to-last
line of Appendix B2.1).


(5)

Appendix B, as a whole, is a [near] duplicate of Appendix A of
RFC 4303; the latter does not contain the typo from item (4)
above, and it contains extended and improved explanations in
the third subsection -- corresponding to page 32 of RFC 4302.

Readers and potential implementors need to read both Appendices
just to detect that they are in fact essentially the same spec.

IMHO, it would have been better to avoid this re-specification,
and instead have pointers to the (better, and mandatory!) ESP
Appendix placed into the AH RFC.
Having a single specification always avoids disagreement or
inconsistency, and it facilitates the maintenance of the spec.


(6)

Finally:
I would have appreciated the introduction of an explicit version
numbering for AH, e.g. rename:
      AH as per RFC 1826  to  AHv1,
      AH as per RFC 2402  to  AHv2  or  AHv2.0,   and
      AH as per RFC 4302  to  AHv3  or  AHv2.1
(or similar).

This would make it easier to specify / identify versions and/or
version specific behaviour in implementations, without having
to refer to the RFC numbers explicitely. (Similar numbering has
proven very useful with protocols like BGP, SNMP, IMAP, POP, etc.)

Hello,
this is one of a couple of messages being prepared with comments
on the new basic IPsec RFCs, RFC 430{1,2,3,6}; it deals with the
new ESP specification, RFC 4303.

I have found only a few minor textual and editorial issues with
this document.
Therefore, you just might make note of most of the subsequent
remarks for use when preparing the next update of the documant
(if any).
The issue listed as item (3) below should perhaps be resolved
by an Errata Note.


(1)

Section 2.1 of RFC 4303 re-states a lot of material from the
IPsec Architecture document, RFC 4301, without being able to
present all the details.  SPI selection has become a quite
complicated procedure with subtle details, which all can be
found in RFC 4301.

IMHO, it would have been very much preferrable to replace most
of the text in section 2.1 by a short referral to RFC 4301.
Any replication of specification entails the danger of
inconsistencies and raises the question of "truth weight"
for the concurring specifications; it is better to avoid
such "races" from the beginning.

This same issue applies to section 2.4 of RFC 2402. (By accident,
I have forgotten to mention it in my comments on that document.)

More concretely, I would have preferred the replacement of the
second up to the second-to-last paragraph of section 2.1 of RFC 4303,
on pages 10/11,

  For a unicast SA, the SPI can be used by itself to specify an SA, or
  it may be used in conjunction with the IPsec protocol type (in this
  ...

  ...
  ...
  ...

  ...
  multicast address, and source address.  An Any-Source Multicast group
  SA requires only an SPI and a destination multicast address as an
  identifier.

by a short note, e.g.

  All implementations of ESP MUST support the Security Association
  Database (SAD) as specified in the IPsec Archtecture document
  [Ken-Arch] and the SA lookup procedures for unicast traffic
  specified therein.  ESP implementations SHOULD support extensions
  to the SAD and the SA lookup procedures specified in documents
  amending [Ken-Arch], e.g. for multicast traffic or mobility support,
  if they intend to provide ESP support for such scenarios.

A similar change would be applicable to RFC 4302, section 2.4,
pages 6/7.


(2)

In section 3.4.3, on the lower half of page 29, RFC 4303 says:

                                                    [...].  In either
   case, if the integrity check fails, the receiver MUST discard the
   received IP datagram as invalid; this is an auditable event.  The
   audit log entry for this event SHOULD include the SPI value,
   [...]

Because the audit log details are in a separate sentence, the logical
hierarchy implied by using one semicolon and one full stop is brocken.
It would have been better to say:
                                                    [...].  In either
   case, if the integrity check fails, the receiver MUST discard the
|  received IP datagram as invalid.  This is an auditable event.  The
   audit log entry for this event SHOULD include the SPI value,
   [...]

Similar punctuation already is used in many places of the RFC.


(3)

As mentioned in section 7, section 3.4 has been reorganized from
RFC 2406.
During that process, the perhaps most important part of ESP inbound
packet processing has disappeared from the section headlines:
decryption !

To cover what's inside, and to make that locatable in the ToC,
perhaps the section headline,

 3.4.4.  Integrity Check Value Verification

on page 30, and in the ToC, should be modified to read:

 3.4.4.  Integrity Check Value Verification and Payload Decryption

I would like to recommend that you submit an RFC Errata Note to
catch this issue.


(4)

In section 3.4.4.2, the same issue as (2) above also applies to
the item numbered "2." on page 32.


(5)  References

RFC 4306 repeatedly refers to its predecessor, RFC 2406, but it omits
giving a formal (Informative) Reference to that document in Section
10.2 on page 37.

Perhaps it would also have been worth noting that a *full* version
of the research paper [Kra01] can be found on IACR ePrint, document
2001/040.


(6)  Appendix A

As mentioned in my comments on RFC 4302, this appendix is the more
complete and hence preferrable text compared to App. B of RFC 4302.
There is one exception:
The formatting of tha last part of A2.1 ia less pleasant.
To enhance readability, it is always preferrable not to break
simple expressions apart by line breaks, whenever possible.  In
this case, simple relational expressions are broken into 2 lines.

RFC 4303, on page 40, says:

   In checking for replayed packets,

      + Under Case A: If Seql >= Bl (where Bl = Tl - W + 1) AND Seql <=
        Tl, then check the corresponding bit in the window to see if
        this Seql has already been seen.  If yes, reject the packet.  If
        no, perform integrity check (see Appendix A2.2. below for
        determination of Seqh).

      + Under Case B: If Seql >= Bl (where Bl = Tl - W + 1) OR Seql <=
        Tl, then check the corresponding bit in the window to see if
        this Seql has already been seen.  If yes, reject the packet.  If
        no, perform integrity check (see Appendix A2.2. below for
        determination of Seqh).

The formatting in RFC 4302 of the same text (with the already
mentioned typo there corrected, and the Appendix name adapted),
is better:

   In checking for replayed packets,

      + Under Case A: If Seql >= Bl (where Bl = Tl - W + 1) AND
        Seql <= Tl, then check the corresponding bit in the window to
        see if this Seql has already been seen.  If yes, reject the
        packet.  If no, perform integrity check (see Appendix A2.2
        below for determination of Seqh).

      + Under Case B: If Seql >= Bl (where Bl = Tl - W + 1) OR
        Seql <= Tl, then check the corresponding bit in the window to
        see if this Seql has already been seen.  If yes, reject the
        packet.  If no, perform integrity check (see Appendix A2.2
        below for determination of Seqh).

But I would even have preferred this formatting:

   In checking for replayed packets,

      + Under Case A:
        If Seql >= Bl (where Bl = Tl - W + 1) AND Seql <= Tl,
        then check the corresponding bit in the window to see if this
        Seql has already been seen.  If yes, reject the packet.
        If no, perform integrity check (see Appendix A2.2 below for
        determination of Seqh).

      + Under Case B:
        If Seql >= Bl (where Bl = Tl - W + 1) OR Seql <= Tl,
        then check the corresponding bit in the window to see if this
        Seql has already been seen.  If yes, reject the packet.
        If no, perform integrity check (see Appendix A2.2 below for
        determination of Seqh).

  Alfred HÎnes.

Outch,
and please excuse me:

I just discovered that my first message sent to you
erroneously named "RFC 4301" in its Subject where it was
intended to name "RFC 4302"

And in my comments on RFC 4303, I forgot to mention the
'version numbering' issue reported as item (6) for RFC 4302
-- this issue is applies similarly to RFC 4303.

Hello,
this is one of a couple of messages being prepared with comments
on the new basic IPsec RFCs, RFC 430{1,2,3,6}; it deals with the
new IPsec Architecture document, RFC 4301.

I group my comments in
-  typos and other textual flaws
-  more fundamental concerns

The former might be considered for an RFC Errata Note on RFC 4301,
while you migth just want to make a note of the latter for use when
preparing the next update of the document (if any).


(1)  [typo]

In section 4.1, on page 14, RFC 4301 says:

   DISCUSSION: Although the DSCP [NiBlBaBL98, Gro02] and Explicit
   Congestion Notification (ECN) [RaFlBl01] fields are not "selectors",
   as that term in used in this architecture, the sender will need a
   mechanism to direct packets with a given (set of) DSCP values to the
   appropriate SA.  This mechanism might be termed a "classifier".

It should say ( s/in used/is used/ ) :

   DISCUSSION: Although the DSCP [NiBlBaBL98, Gro02] and Explicit
   Congestion Notification (ECN) [RaFlBl01] fields are not "selectors",
|  as that term is used in this architecture, the sender will need a
   mechanism to direct packets with a given (set of) DSCP values to the
   appropriate SA.  This mechanism might be termed a "classifier".

(2)  [textual improvement]

In section 4.4.3.2, the last lines on page 45 say:

                                                      [...].  An entry
   used with certificate-based authentication MAY include additional
   data to facilitate certificate revocation status, e.g., a list of
 << page break >>
   appropriate OCSP responders or CRL repositories, [...]

This seems to make not much sense. It should perhaps say:

                                                      [...].  An entry
   used with certificate-based authentication MAY include additional
   data to facilitate certificate revocation status determination, e.g.,
   a list of appropriate OCSP responders or CRL repositories, [...]

(3)  [typo]

The second paragraph of section 4.4.3.3, on page 46, says:

   If the entry indicates that the IKE ID is to be used, then the PAD
   entry ID field defines the authorized set of IDs.  If the entry
   indicates that child SAs traffic selectors are to be used, then an
   additional data element is required, in the form of IPv4 and/or IPv6
   address ranges. [...]

It should say ( s/SAa/SA/ ) :

   If the entry indicates that the IKE ID is to be used, then the PAD
   entry ID field defines the authorized set of IDs.  If the entry
|  indicates that child SA traffic selectors are to be used, then an
   additional data element is required, in the form of IPv4 and/or IPv6
   address ranges. [...]

(4)  [textual consistency]

Below the table on page 59, section 5.1.2.2 says:

    Notes:

      (1) - (6) See Section 5.1.2.1.

It should say:

    Notes:

|     (1) - (3), (5), (6)  See Section 5.1.2.1.


(5)  [typo]

The second paragraph of App. D.2, on page 89, says:

                                                    [...]. (If we choose
   to allow carriage of fragments on transport mode SAs for IPv6, the
   problems arises in that context as well.)
          ^     ^^

There obviously is a singular/plural mismatch.
The text should say:
                                                    [...]. (If we choose
   to allow carriage of fragments on transport mode SAs for IPv6, the
|  problem arises in that context as well.)


(6)  Insufficient IPcomp integration

At the end of section 3.1, on page 10, RFC 4301 says:

   IPsec optionally supports negotiation of IP compression [SMPT01],
   motivated in part by the observation that when encryption is employed
   within IPsec, it prevents effective compression by lower protocol
   layers.

It has also been observed that payload compression can help counter
TPA.  Thus, there are at least two reasons for a tight integration
of IPComp with IPsec.
But I could not find any 'hook' in RFC 4301 (and in RFC 4302 / 4303
as well) for the concrete support of IPComp in ESP / AH IPsec SAs.

IKEv2 (RFC 4306) roughly allows negotiation of IPComp, but how shall
that be triggered and work, in an interoperable way, if there are no
architectural provisions for the support of IPComp designed in into
the IPsec databases (SPD, SAD) as described in RFC 4301 ????


(7)  Insufficient integration with QoS (DS)

The steps taken for the integration with Differentiated Services
are half-hearted.  The processing rules specified for the DSCP
field in the IP header[s] remain incomplete as long as there is
no specified interoperable way to use DSCP as an selector as well.

IMHO, the discussion on page 14 of RFC 4301 is misleading because
DS classification and treatment needs to be done independent from
IPsec treatment.
In many scenarios, e.g. on 'hosts' or 'QoS gateways' that must
perform fine-grained traffic classification, DS treatment must
be performed strictly before IPsec treatment in the outbound
case (and after IPsec in the inbound case), to make ULP fields
accessible to the DS classifiers.
IPsec should then be capable of guaranteeing the same security
treatment of all packets of certain traffic class to a given
destination.

I still have problems to imagine how DS integration could be
achieved with the processing model of section 5.1 of RFC 4301.

At the end of section 3.1, on page 10, RFC 4301 says:


(8)  Inconsistent DS Field handling specified in Section 5.1.2.x

The IPv6 related table in section 5.1.2.2 contains the line,

        DS Field         copied from inner hdr (5)    no change (9)

and the subsequent Notes give a lengthy explanation under (9).

Contrary to that, the corresponding table line for IPv4, in section
5.1.2.1 on page 57, is *not* linked to such a note.

I cannot see any reason precluding the application of the arguments
given in Note (9) of section 5.1.2.2 to the IPv4 case as well.

Have I missed any significant point there?


(9)  SA negotiation -- capability mismatch with IKEv2

See section 4.4.1.2, second paragraph.

Does this need any comment ????    (It's a shame!)


Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

I'd like to submit a few comments on the recently published
RFC 4339 edited by you.
(I omit mentioning minor/trivial typos, like missing articles.)


(1)  [typo]

I suspect a significant typo in section 3.3 of RFC 4339,
9 text lines above the bottom of page 9.  The RFC text says:

   That is, on a link, an anycast address is assumed to be unique.  DNS
   clients today already have redundancy by having multiple well-known
|  anycast addresses configured as RDNSS addresses.  [...]
   ^^^

IMHO, in this context, *unicast* is what we already have.
Hence, the RFC should say:

   That is, on a link, an anycast address is assumed to be unique.  DNS
   clients today already have redundancy by having multiple well-known
|  unicast addresses configured as RDNSS addresses.  [...]
   ^^^


(2)  [typo]

In section 5.3.3, in the lower half of page 17, RFC 4339 says:

   4.  It is sub-optimal to utilize the radio resources in 3GPP networks
|      for DHCPv6 messages if there is a simpler alternative is
       available.
                                   ^^^^                     ^^^^
It should say:

   4.  It is sub-optimal to utilize the radio resources in 3GPP networks
|      for DHCPv6 messages if there is a simpler alternative available.


(3)  outdated Informative Reference

Unfortunately, the publication process of RFC 4339 had an
overlap with the update to the IPv6 Addressing Architecture
document.  More than two weeks ahead of publication of RFC 4339,
RFC 4291 had been published, obsoleting RFC 3513 [10].
The former has released most of the restrictions on the use of
anycast addresses formerly specified by the latter.  In various
places, a text simplification would have been possible in RFC
4339, would it have been based on RFC 4291 instead of RFC 3513.


I propose that you submit an Author's Errata Note for RFC 4339
in order to correct issues (1) and (2) above.
Issue (3) is perhaps too subtle to be covered by such a note.
Alternatively, if you prefer and give me your consent, I could
submit the Errata Note as well.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
I'd like to submit a few comments on the recently published RFC 4388
 authored by you.


(1)  [word omission]

The second paragraph of section 4.2 of RFC 4388 says:

   The DHCP Server MIB effort [DHCPMIB] grew out of traffic engineering
   and troubleshooting activities at large DHCP installations, and is
   primarily intended as a method of gathering performance statistics
   about servers the load presented to them.

It should perhaps better say:

   The DHCP Server MIB effort [DHCPMIB] grew out of traffic engineering
   and troubleshooting activities at large DHCP installations, and is
   primarily intended as a method of gathering performance statistics
|  about servers and the load presented to them.
                ^^^^^


(2)  [improper wording]

RFC 4388 repeatedly talks about

   "[an] IP address most recently accessed by a client"
                                  ^^^^^^^^^^^
where, IMHO, it should talk about

|  "[an] IP address most recently assigned to a client"
                                  ^^^^^^^^^^^
Rationale:
  The client may access any IP address at any time.  Such access
  is mostly unrelated to the protocol described in RFC 4338.

The affected places in the text I found are:
- Section 5, first paragraph of both the second and the third
  bulleted items, on page 10 / 11, respectively;
- Last paragraph on page 17 (within section 6.4.1).


(3)  [incomplete specification]

The second paragraph of Section 6.4.1, on page 17, says:

   In the event that an IP address appears in the "ciaddr" field of a
   DHCPLEASEQUERY message, if that IP address is one managed by the DHCP
   server, then that IP address MUST be set in the "ciaddr" field of a
   DHCPLEASEUNASSIGNED message.

It should in fact say:

   In the event that an IP address appears in the "ciaddr" field of a
   DHCPLEASEQUERY message, if that IP address is one managed by the DHCP
   server, then that IP address MUST be set in the "ciaddr" field of a
|  DHCPRELEASEACTIVE or DHCPLEASEUNASSIGNED message returned.
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                           ^^^^^^^^^

Rationale:
  From the remaining text, it can be inferred that the "ciaddr"
  field from the DHCPLEASEQUERY message should be copied to an
  DHCPRELEASEACTIVE reply message as well -- cf. section 6.4.2.

IMHO, this copy should be performed generally, i.e. also in the case
described by the subsequent paragraph:

   If the IP address is not managed by the DHCP server, then a
   DHCPLEASEUNKNOWN message must be returned.

that therefore might be amended to say:

   If the IP address is not managed by the DHCP server, then a
|  DHCPLEASEUNKNOWN message MUST be returned, with that IP address
|  set in the "ciaddr" field.

[The original 'must' should be a 'MUST' because the alternatives
are also specified as a 'MUST' -- or else the specification would
be incomplete.]

Taken together, it might be preferable to restate this fact by
only changing the first paragraph cited above as follows, and leave
the second paragraph unchanged with the exception of the 'must':

   In the event that an IP address appears in the "ciaddr" field of a
|  DHCPLEASEQUERY message, then that IP address MUST be set in the
|  "ciaddr" field of any reply returned.

|  If that IP address is one managed by the DHCP server, then it MUST
|  reply with a DHCPRELEASEACTIVE or DHCPLEASEUNASSIGNED message.

   If the IP address is not managed by the DHCP server, then a
|  DHCPLEASEUNKNOWN message MUST be returned.

Please comment on which alternative you prefer.


I propose that you submit an Author's Errata Note for RFC 4388
based on the material presented above (this would save several
additional email exchanges).  But if you like, I can also prepare
a detailed Errata Note on your advice and consent.  In any case,
issue (2) will need to be expanded properly, and for issue (3),
one of the proposals has to be selected.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
the recently published RFC 4334 contains the following
textual flaws that should be corrected by an Errata Note.


(1)

In the 3rd paragraph of section 1, on page 2 RFC 4334 says:

   For example, the same wireless station might use IEEE 802.1X to
   authenticate to a corporate IEEE 802.11 WLAN and a public IEEE 802.11
   "hotspot."  [...]
           ^^
The syntax error of that sentence should be corrected to say:

   For example, the same wireless station might use IEEE 802.1X to
   authenticate to a corporate IEEE 802.11 WLAN and a public IEEE 802.11
|  "hotspot".  [...]
           ^^

(2)

At the end of the 2nd paragraph of section 5, on page 6, the RFC says:

                           [...].  Whenever this SSID disclosure is a
   concern, different peer certificates ought to be used for the each
   WLAN.
                                                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^
It should say:

                           [...].  Whenever this SSID disclosure is a
|  concern, different peer certificates ought to be used for each WLAN.


(3)

In Section 7.1, on page 7, the Normative Reference,

should say:

Lines: 114

Hello,
reading the recently published RFC 4396 authored by you,
I found a few flaws I'd like to report
(sequence of items is most important first, this time).


(1)  mis-specification for TYPE 3 Header ???

Repeatedly, the RFC text specifies, e.g. at the beginning of
section 4.1.4, on page 23:

   This header type is used to transport either the entire modifier
   contents present in a text sample or just the first fragment of them.
   [....]

   If a text sample containing modifiers is fragmented, this header MUST
   be used to transport the first fragment or, if possible, the complete
   modifiers.

Subsequently, on page 24, the same section says:

  o The TOTAL/THIS field has the same meaning as for TYPE 2.

|    For TYPE 3 units containing the last (trailing) modifier fragment,
|    the value of TOTAL MUST be equal to that of THIS (TOTAL=THIS).  In
|    addition, TOTAL=THIS MUST be greater than one, because the total
|    number of fragments of a text sample is logically always larger
|    than one.
|
|    Otherwise, if TOTAL is different from THIS in a TYPE 3 unit, this
|    means that the unit contains the first fragment of the modifiers.

Apparently, this does not match the remainder of the specification,
and is not logical in many respects.

Under TYPE=3, the only combinations allowed for TOTAL/THIS should be:
  *  "1 of 1" -- entire modifier contents,  and
  *  "1 of n" -- first fragment of (n>1 fragments of) modifier contents

The former case is explicitely excluded by the present text!
This cannot have been intended.

Hence, the above text should better say:

  o The TOTAL/THIS field has the same meaning as for TYPE 2.

|    For TYPE 3 units, the value of THIS must always be 1 (one).
|    If the unit contains the entire modifier content, TOTAL is 1 (one)
|    as well, otherwise the unit contains the first fragment of the
|    modifiers, and TOTAL must be greater than THIS.

(or similar; e.g., you might always substitute "(0x1)" for "(one)",
or "0x1" for "1 (one)", or use other wording as well.)


(2) encoding of / range of values for the TOTAL and THIS fields

The text (more or less implicitely) specifies the use of the
value range,  1..15,  for these 4-bit fields.

This wastes a bit of bandwidth and excludes from transmission
certain payloads that might (occasionally) require a maximum
of 16 extents.
It would have been useful to specify an "n-1" encoding style
for both fields, i.e. making the (encoded) values  0..15
correspond to a total of  1..16  fragments, or the 1st..16th
fragment, respectively.
Alternatively (but more difficult to implement), a value of
'0' could have been allowed to denote 16 fragments total or
the 16th fragment, respectively.
Both alternatives would lead to simplified implementations,
making the currently possible error case, TOTAL=0, (cf. text
near the end of section 4.1.3) impossible, and hence avoiding
the need to check for it.

Unfortunately, this perhaps cannot be changed now any more.


(3)  textual omission

Near the bottom of page 22, section 4.1.3. says:

     Finally, note that clients MAY use SLEN to buffer space for the
     remaining fragments of a text sample.

It should say:

     Finally, note that clients MAY use SLEN to allocate buffer space
     for the remaining fragments of a text sample.


It might be very useful to correct item (1) as soon as possible
to avoid confusion.  Item (3) is straightforward.

I propose that you submit an Authors' Errata Note by sending email
to the RFC-Ed. for publication on the RFC Errata web page, making
deliberately use of the material presented above for items (1) and (3).
Alternatively, I could submit an Errata Note on my own, covering these
two items; to this end, a statement of your consent for item (1) would
be needed, since this is a correction of normative content.

Please comment.


Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

  Hellos,

In the RFC 1712, the definitions for Latitude and Longitude are swapped.

I believe this can be considered a typo as the actual values in the
resource record can (and should) be kept in their current order.=20

The correct descriptions are (in general terms):=20
    Latitude is the degrees North or South of the Equator and can be
referenced with a range of -90 to +90.=20
    Longitude is the degrees East or West of the prime meridian and can
be referenced with a range of -180 to +180.

Below is my attempt to write the errata.  If someone wants to make
suggestion about how the errata should be written, please tell me and I
will make a go at doing it as requested.

In RFC 1712 the terms Latitude and Longitude are swapped in that each
was given the other's definition. =20
Also the preferred order of the terms is Latitude then Longitude.  In
addition to matching the terms with their correct definitions, this
ordering is also addressed.

In Section 3, page 3 is a table, it says:

        MSB                                        LSB=20
        +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+=20
        /                 LONGITUDE                  /=20
        +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+=20
        /                  LATITUDE                  /=20
        +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+=20
        /                  ALTITUDE                  /=20
        +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+

It should say:

        MSB                                        LSB=20
        +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+=20
        /                  LATITUDE                  /=20
        +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+=20
        /                 LONGITUDE                  /=20
        +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+=20
        /                  ALTITUDE                  /=20
        +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+

Rational: It is only the terms that are being corrected, the value
ranges associated with the first (-90..90) and second (-180..180)
arguments are in the preferred order.


In Section 3, page 3 under 'where:', it says:

   LONGITUDE The real number describing the longitude encoded as a=20
             printable string. The precision is limited by 256 charcters

             within the range -90..90 degrees. Positive numbers=20
             indicate locations north of the equator.

   LATITUDE The real number describing the latitude encoded as a=20
            printable string. The precision is limited by 256 charcters=20
            within the range -180..180 degrees. Positive numbers=20
            indicate locations east of the prime meridian.

Is should say:

   LATITUDE The real number describing the latitude encoded as a=20
            printable string. The precision is limited by 256 characters

            within the range -90..90 degrees. Positive numbers=20
            indicate locations north of the equator.

   LONGITUDE The real number describing the longitude encoded as a=20
             printable string. The precision is limited by 256
characters=20
             within the range -180..180 degrees. Positive numbers=20
             indicate locations east of the prime meridian.

Rational: to match the terms with their correct definitions, and fix the
spelling of the word 'characters'.


In Section 4, page 3, it says:

   GPOS has the following format:=20
           <owner> <ttl> <class> GPOS <longitude> <latitude> <altitude>

It should say:

   GPOS has the following format:=20
           <owner> <ttl> <class> GPOS <latitude> <longitude> <altitude>

Rational: It is only the terms that are being corrected, the value
ranges associated with the first (-90..90) and second (-180..180)
arguments are in the preferred order.


In Section 4, page 4, it says:

   The owner, ttl, and class fields are optional and default to the last

   defined value if omitted. The longitude is a floating point number=20
   ranging from -90 to 90 with positive values indicating locations=20
   north of the equator.  For example Perth, Western Australia is=20
   located at 32^ 7` 19" south of the equator which would be specified=20
   as -32.68820.  The latitude is a number ranging from -180.0 to 180.0.

   For example Perth, Western Australia is located at 116^ 2' 25" east=20
   of the prime meridian which would be specified as 116.86520.  Curtin=20
   University, Perth is also 10 meters above sea-level.

Hello,

I believe I came across a few minor typos in RFC 1034 that I'd like to
report and for which you can hopefully include in a errata when you
get the chance.

Section 2.2. says:

  - Where there tradeoffs between the cost of acquiring data, the

but should probably say:

  - Where there are tradeoffs between the cost of acquiring data, the

Section 3.6.2. says:

  For example, suppose a name server was processing a query with for

but should probably simply say:

  For example, suppose a name server was processing a query for

Section 4.3.4. misspells 'because':

  This feature can be particularly important in a system which
  implements naming short shorts that use search lists beacuse

Section 6.1. ends this way:

  Relative and absolute domain names may be freely intermixed in a
  master

which is incomplete.  It's unclear exactly how that sentence may have
been intended to end, but minimally I would suggeste it at least
terminated with 'file.'.

Section 6.2.8. in the diagram shows 'QTYPE=A', but should be of
type 'CNAME' based on the context of the example.

Hello,
I'd like to submit a few comments, and corrections for obvious
errata in the recently published RFC 4380 ("Teredo") authored
by you.  The subsequent items are ordered most important first,
according to my (subjective) ranking.


(1)  Inconsistency on cryptographic algorithm (MAC) requirements

Within section 5.2.2, on the upper half of page 21, RFC 4380 states:

   To maximize interoperability, this specification defines a default
   algorithm in which the authentication value is computed according the
|  HMAC specification [RFC2104] and the SHA1 function [FIPS-180].
   Clients and servers may agree to use HMAC combined with a different
   function, or to use a different algorithm altogether, such as for
   example AES-XCBC-MAC-96 [RFC3566].

   The default authentication algorithm is based on the HMAC algorithm
   according to the following specifications:

|  - the hash function shall be the SHA1 function [FIPS-180].
   - the secret value shall be the shared secret with which the client
     was configured.

Contrary to that, within Section 7.2.1, in the paragraph extending
from page 39 to page 40, the same RFC says:

   If the shared secret contains sufficient entropy, the attacker would
   have to defeat the one-way function used to compute the
   authentication value.  This specification suggests a default
<<page break>>
|  algorithm combining HMAC and MD5.  If the protection afforded by MD5
   was not deemed sufficient, clients and servers can agree to use a
   different algorithm, e.g., SHA1.

I have been educated repeatedly that Security Considerations in RFCs
contain normative content when describing protocol behaviour.
Therefore, it should not happen that text in Security Considerations
contradicts normative content of other sections of an RFC.

Regarding the well known security issues that make MD5 appear much
weaker than SHA-1, according to contemporary comprehension by the
cryptographic community, the former specification (Section 5.2.2)
seems to be the better choice.
I therefore strongly recommend to publish an Author's Errata Note
for RFC 4380 correcting Section 7.2.1, replacing the snippit above
by text conforming to the rules specified in Section 5.2.2, e.g.:

   If the shared secret contains sufficient entropy, the attacker would
   have to defeat the one-way function used to compute the
|  authentication value.  This specification defines a default algorithm
|  combining HMAC and SHA-1.  Clients and servers can agree to use a
|  different message authentication algorithm, e.g. AES-XCBC-MAC-96.
|  See Section 5.2.2 for details.


(2)  Incomplete IANA Considerations

Section 9 of RFC 4380, on page 50, says:

   This memo documents a request to IANA to allocate a 32-bit Teredo
   IPv6 service prefix, as specified in Section 2.6, and a Teredo IPv4
   multicast address, as specified in Section 2.17.

It should say:

|  On requests documented in this memo, IANA has allocated a 32-bit
|  Teredo IPv6 service prefix, as specified in Section 2.6, a Teredo
|  IPv4 multicast address, as specified in Section 2.17, and a Teredo
|  UDP Port number, as specified in Section 2.7.

Rationale:
As per publication of the RFC, these assignments *have been* performed
by the IANA; I propose modified wording reflecting this fact.
Apparently, an IANA assignment also has been performed on behalf of the
Teredo proposal as documented in Section 2.7; for completeness, this
assignment should be mentioned in the IANA Considerations section as
well.  This will also serve as an easy-to-find "pointer" for readers
looking for the purpose of the assignment found in the IANA registry.


(3)  Various typos

I have found a couple of apparent typos in RFC 4380.  The sub-items
 below are pre-formatted for easy inclusion into an RFC errata note.


(3.1) Section 5.2.2, page 21

The first paragraph on page 21 contains the sentence:

                                           [...].  Before transmission,
   the authentication value is computed according to the specified
   algorithm; on reception, the same algorithm is used to compute a
   target value from the content of the receive packet.  [...]

It should say:

                                           [...].  Before transmission,
   the authentication value is computed according to the specified
   algorithm; on reception, the same algorithm is used to compute a
|  target value from the content of the received packet.  [...]
                                               ^

(3.2) Section 5.2.3, page 23

The second paragraph on page 23 [numbered list item 4)] says:

      [...].  The client SHOULD reply with a unicast Teredo bubble, sent
   to the source IPv4 address and source port of the local discovery
   bubble; the IPv6 source address of the bubble will be set to local
   Teredo IPv6 address; [...]

It should say:

      [...].  The client SHOULD reply with a unicast Teredo bubble, sent
   to the source IPv4 address and source port of the local discovery
|  bubble; the IPv6 source address of the bubble will be set to the local
   Teredo IPv6 address; [...]
                                                                ^^^^

(3.3) Section 5.2.7, page 27

The long paragraph in the middle of page 27 says:

                                              [...].  If the secondary
   qualification fails, the interval determination procedure will not be
   used, and the interval value will remain to the default value, 30
   seconds.  [...]

It should say:

                                              [...].  If the secondary
   qualification fails, the interval determination procedure will not be
|  used, and the interval value will remain at the default value, 30
   seconds.  [...]
                                           ^^^^

(3.4) Section 5.2.9, page 30

The last paragraph of Section 5.2.9 says:

            [...]  The nonce value and the date at which the packet was
   sent will be documented in a provisional peer entry for the IPV6
   destination.  The ICMPv6 packet will then be sent [...]

It should say:

            [...]  The nonce value and the date at which the packet was
|  sent will be documented in a provisional peer entry for the IPv6
   destination.  The ICMPv6 packet will then be sent [...]
                                                               ^^^^

(3.5) Section 7.2, page 39

The last sentence of Section 7.2 says:

      [...]  The attacker may have one of two objectives: it may try to
   deny service to the Teredo client by providing it with an address
   that is in fact unreachable, or it may try to insert itself as a
   relay for all client communications, effectively enabling a variety
   of "man-in-the-middle" attack.

It should say:

      [...]  The attacker may have one of two objectives: it may try to
   deny service to the Teredo client by providing it with an address
   that is in fact unreachable, or it may try to insert itself as a
   relay for all client communications, effectively enabling a variety
|  of "man-in-the-middle" attacks.
                                ^


(4)  Formatting issue

RFC 4380 contains a striking number of spurious blank lines inserted
in the middle of running text, interrupting proper paragraph formating.

Browsing through RFC 4380, I have found such spurious blank lines on
pages 23, 30, 33, 35, 41, 44, and 46.

RFC-Ed:
  A few weeks ago, I had promised to not complain repeatedly again
  about this issue.
  But the apparent frequency of the issue again has led me to suspect
  a procedural problem.  Please check.  Thanks!


Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hi again,

  The following quote from my previous message was erroneous - I'd
mixed up the two documents in this case.  The RFC uses "one-way" and
the draft (inconsistently) "one way".  Please disregard this part.

Regards,

	Henrik

Hello,
the recently published RFC 4404 contains an error
that preferrably should be addressed by an Errata Note:


Section "2.1.  FCIP Entity Instances Table" of RFC 4404, on page 3,
says:

   The FCIP Entity table contains information about this entity's
   existing instances of FCIP entities.

It should say:
                                                         vvvvvv
|  The FCIP Entity table contains information about this device's
   existing instances of FCIP entities.

Rationale:
* The present text is almost recursive nonsense.
* Section 2. explains the terminology.
* The DESCRIPTION clause of the fcipEntityInstanceTable OBJECT-TYPE
  definition (on page 9) correctly states:

           "Information about this FCIP device's existing instances of
            FCIP entities."
                                        ^^^^^^

Hello,
reading the recently published RFC 4256 (SSH Generic Auth.),
I suspect having found a serious issue perhaps needing correction.

In Section 3.2, "Information Requests", on page 5, RFC 4256 says:

   The language tag is deprecated and SHOULD be the empty string.  It
   may be removed in a future revision of this specification.  Instead,
   the server SHOULD select the language used based on the tags
   communicated during key exchange [SSH-TRANS].

   If the language tag is not the empty string, the server SHOULD use
   the specified language for any messages sent to the client as part of
   this protocol.  The language tag SHOULD NOT be used for language
   selection for messages outside of this protocol.  If the server does
   not support the requested language, the language to be used is
   implementation-dependent.

(These two paragraphs apparently have been copied from Section 3.1
without change.)

This specification makes no sense here:

The Information Request is sent from the *server* to the client,
and it already contains strings that *do* make use of a particular
language/locale.

The one and only useful interpretation of the 'language tag'
in the Information Request message is that it specifies the
language/locale used for building the 'instruction' and 'prompt'
strings in the request.
This parallels the use of the language tag, e.g., in the
Disconnection Message of the SSH Transport Layer Protocol
(cf. RFC 4253, Sect. 11.1).

NOTE:  The client might have announced a locale *list* in the
initial exchange, and the server should choose from that list;
the actual choice [for a particular message with text strings]
needs to be communicated to the client.

NOTE:  In multi-stage authentication, the backend authentication
mechanisms will be the source of all these strings, and the SSH
server might have no choice than to just report the locale used
by each backend mechanism to the client; such mechanisms easily
could make use of different locales - hence the locale needs to
be announced per message from the server in this context!

NOTE:  RFC 4253 recommends to send empty language tags fields in
the initial exchange; this makes the 'language tag' field in all
SSH protocol messages containing text to be presented to the user
*very* desirable !

Therefore, the 'language tag' should also better *not* be deprecated
in the SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_INFO_REQUEST message!


Please resolve this mis-specification issue.

I *strongly* recommend that you submit an Author's Errata Note
to the RFC Editor for publication on the RFC Errata web page,
presenting an appropriate replacement for the two paragraphs
in the snippit above.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
I'd like to report a few textual issues I found in your
recently published RFC 4364 (BGP/MPLS IP VPNs).  I propose
to post an Errata Note for RFC 4364 to resolve these issues.

To facilitate the recognition of the text changes proposed,
I have added change bars ('|') in column 1, and up/down pointing
marker lines ('^^^'/'vvv').


(1)  Section 1 (Introduction)

The 1st paragraph on page 3 contains the sentence:

                       [...].  The PE routers distribute, to the CE
   routers in a particular VPN, the routes from other the CE routers in
   that VPN.  [...]

It should say:

                       [...].  The PE routers distribute, to the CE
|  routers in a particular VPN, the routes from the other CE routers in
   that VPN.  [...]
                                                ^^^^^^^^^


(2)  Section 3.3 (Populating the VRFs)

The last paragraph of Section 3.3, on mid-page 12, says:

   If an attachment circuit leads to a site which is in multiple VPNs,
   the attachment circuit may still associated with a single VRF, in
   which case the VRF will contain routes from the full set of VPNs of
   which the site is a member.

It should say:
                                   vvvv
   If an attachment circuit leads to a site which is in multiple VPNs,
|  the attachment circuit may still be associated with a single VRF, in
   which case the VRF will contain routes from the full set of VPNs of
   which the site is a member.


(3)  Section 6 (Maintaining Proper Isolation of VPNs)

At the bottom of page 26, and extending to page 27, the text says:

   The first condition ensure that any labeled packets received from
   non-backbone routers have a legitimate and properly assigned label at
<< page break >>
   the top of the label stack.  [...]

It should say:
                             vv
|  The first condition ensures that any labeled packets received from
   non-backbone routers have a legitimate and properly assigned label at
<< page break >>
   the top of the label stack.  [...]


(4)  Section 7 (How PEs Learn Routes from CEs)

The descrition of 'technique #4', on mid-page 28 says:

      4. The PE and CE routers may be BGP peers, and the CE router may
         use BGP (in particular, EBGP to tell the PE router the set of
         address prefixes that are at the CE router's site. (This
         technique can be used in stub VPNs or transit VPNs.)

It should say:
                                    vvv
      4. The PE and CE routers may be BGP peers, and the CE router may
|        use BGP (in particular, EBGP) to tell the PE router the set of
         address prefixes that are at the CE router's site. (This
         technique can be used in stub VPNs or transit VPNs.)


(5)  Section 9 (Carriers' Carriers)

The last paragraph at the bottom of page 31 contains the sentence:

                                                       [...].  All that
   is required is that the external routes be known to whatever routers
   are responsible for putting the label stack on a hitherto unlabeled
   packet and that there be label switched path that leads from those
   routers to their BGP peers at other sites.  [...]

It should say:

                                                       [...].  All that
   is required is that the external routes be known to whatever routers
   are responsible for putting the label stack on a hitherto unlabeled
|  packet and that there be a label switched path that leads from those
   routers to their BGP peers at other sites.  [...]
                           ^^^

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
I'd like to report a few textual issues I found in your recently
published RFC 4365 (BGP/MPLS IP VPN Applicability).  I propose
to post an Errata Note for RFC 4365 to resolve these issues.

To facilitate the recognition of the text changes proposed,
I have added change bars ('|') in column 1, and up/down pointing
marker lines ('^^^'/'vvv').


(1)  Section 6.2 (SP Security Measures)

The first paragraph of Section 6.2, on page 10, contains the sentence:

            [...].  VPN traffic is always encapsulated while traveling
   on the backbone, so preventing illegitimate traffic is a matter of
   ensuring that the PE routers to the encapsulation/decapsulation
   correctly and that encapsulations have not been "spoofed", i.e., that
   the encapsulated packets were actually encapsulated by PE routers.

It should say:

            [...].  VPN traffic is always encapsulated while traveling
   on the backbone, so preventing illegitimate traffic is a matter of
|  ensuring that the PE routers do the encapsulation/decapsulation
   correctly and that encapsulations have not been "spoofed", i.e., that
   the encapsulated packets were actually encapsulated by PE routers.
                               ^^^

(2)  Section 6.3 (Security Framework Template)

The 4th paragraph on page 15 says:

       If these are desired, they must be provided by mechanisms that
       are outside the scope of the VPN mechanisms.  For instance, the
       users can use secure protocols on an end-to-end basis, e.g.,
       IPsec, Secure Shell (SSH), Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), etc.

It should say:

       If these are desired, they must be provided by mechanisms that
       are outside the scope of the VPN mechanisms.  For instance, the
       users can use secure protocols on an end-to-end basis, e.g.,
|      IPsec, Secure Shell (SSH), Transport Layer Security (TLS), etc.
                                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Rationale:
  SSL had subtle, but significant security flaws.
  This was one of the reasons for the IETF to develop a Standards
  Track successor (TLS) to that proprietary protocol.
  IMHO, it would be very much preferrable for a companion document
  (like RFC 4365) to an IETF Standards Track protocol (RFC 4364)
  to refer to the more secure IETF Standards Track solution.


(3)  Section 6.3 (Security Framework Template), again

The last paragraph at the bottom of page 15 says:

           In the common case where the tunnels are MPLS Label Switching
           Routers (LSRs) established by LDP, then control message
           integrity and peer authentication may be achieved by use of
           the TCP MD5 option.

It should say:

|          In the common case where the tunnels are MPLS Label Switched
|          Paths (LSPs) established by LDP, then control message
           integrity and peer authentication may be achieved by use of
           the TCP MD5 option.

Rationale:
  It would indeed save much money to ISPs if they could create Label
  Switching *Routers* (LSRs) via LDP.  But it doesn't work.  :-)
  [ Surely, the employer of the author wouldn't be happy so much! ]


(4)  Section 12 (Migration Impact)

The first sentence of Section 12, on page 22, says:

   Generally, this means replacement of an existing legacy backbone with
   VPN backbone.  [...]

It should say:

   Generally, this means replacement of an existing legacy backbone with
|  a VPN backbone.  [...]
   ^^

  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
I'd like to send you a few comments on, and report a few textual
issues I found in, your recently published RFC 4322 (Opportunistic
Encryption for IKE).
I propose to post an Errata Note for RFC 4364 to resolve the issues
listed below under item (1) ... (8).

To facilitate the recognition of the text changes proposed,
I have added change bars ('|') in column 1, and up/down pointing
marker lines ('^^^'/'vvv').


(1)  Section 1.1

The 2nd paragraph on page 3 says:

                     [...].  A future document [IPSECKEY] will describe
   a variation that complies with RFC 3445.  [...]

The reference  [IPSECKEY]  has been updated before publication of
RFC 4322 to point to RFC 4025 (cf. the first entry in Section 14.2,
on page 42).  Hence this wording in not appropriate and inconsistent.
The text should say:
                             vvvvvvvv                  vvv       v
|                    [...].  Another document [IPSECKEY] describes
   a variation that complies with RFC 3445.  [...]


(2)  Section 1.2

The last paragraph of that section, on page 4, says:

                                                            [...].  The
   mechanism described here, however, does provides an additional way to
   distribute the authentication materials; it is a public key method
   that does not require deployment of an X.509 based infrastructure.

It should say:
                                                 vvv
                                                            [...].  The
|  mechanism described here, however, does provide an additional way to
   distribute the authentication materials; it is a public key method
   that does not require deployment of an X.509 based infrastructure.


(3)  Section 3.2.5

a) The second paragraph of Section 3.2.5, on page 16,

   Exit from this state occurs with either a successfully created IPsec
   SA or a failure of some kind.  Successful SA creation results in a
   transition to the key connection state.

should correctly name the state (cf. the Figure in Section 3.2, and
Section 3.2.6) by saying:

   Exit from this state occurs with either a successfully created IPsec
   SA or a failure of some kind.  Successful SA creation results in a
|  transition to the keyed connection state.
                        ^^

b) The second paragraph on page 17 contains the sentence:

                                            [...].  For an OE-
   pessimistic connection, the initiator makes a transition to the deny
   connection again with a low lifespan.  [...]

Conformant to the terminology used in the remainder of the text
(cf. the definition in the 3rd paragraph of Section 3.2, on page 12),
it should say:
                                                              vvvvvvvv
|                                           [...].  For an OE-paranoid
   connection, the initiator makes a transition to the deny connection
   again with a low lifespan.  [...]


c) The final paragraph of the section, still on page 17, says:

   The third failure occurs when there is signature failure while
   authenticating the remote gateway.  This can occur when there has
   been a key roll-over, but DNS has not caught up.  In this case again,
   the initiator makes a transition to the clear-text or the deny
   connection based upon the connection class.  However, the lifespan
   depends upon the remaining time to live in the DNS.  [...]

It should say:
                                         vvv
|  The third failure occurs when there is a signature failure while
   authenticating the remote gateway.  This can occur when there has
   been a key roll-over, but DNS has not caught up.  In this case again,
   the initiator makes a transition to the clear-text or the deny
|  connection state based upon the connection class.  However, the
   lifespan depends upon the remaining time to live in the DNS.  [...]
             ^^^^^^^

Rationale for the second change:
  Transitions occur between *states* in the FSM.  'clear-text' and
  'deny connection' are names given to two of these FSM states.


(4)  Section 3.2.7

The second paragraph of that section refers to [RFC1034]:

   The DNS query and answer that lead to the expiring connection state
   are also examined.  The DNS query may become stale.  (A negative,
   i.e., no such record, answer is valid for the period of time given by
   the MINIMUM field in an attached SOA record.  See [RFC1034] section
   4.3.4.)  [...]

This reference is not very appropriate, and hence misleading.
RFC 1034, and in particular section 4.3.4 of RFC 1034, has been
substantially clarified and updated by RFC 2308.
The Abstract of RFC 2308 says:
   "This document ... replaces [RFC1034 Section 4.3.4]."
(The precise rule for determining the 'negative caching TTL' is a
bit more complicated, taking the minimum of SOA.MINIMUM and SOA.TTL.)

Therefore, RFC 4322 should better refer to RFC 2308, in this place,
perhaps with a detailed hint pointing to section 5 of RFC 2308.


(5)  Section 4.5

The first paragraph of Section 4.5, on page 25, says:

   The implementation described (FreeS/WAN 1.98) neither uses DNSSEC
   directly to explicitly verify the authenticity of zone information,
   nor uses the NSEC records to provide authentication of the absence of
   a TXT or KEY record.  [...]

It should say:

   The implementation described (FreeS/WAN 1.98) neither uses DNSSEC
   directly to explicitly verify the authenticity of zone information,
|  nor does it use the NSEC records to provide authentication of the
   absence of a TXT or KEY record.  [...]

(or similar).


(6)  Section 9.3

The first senrtence of Section 9.3, on page 34, says:

   Tunnels sometimes go down because the remote end crashes,
   disconnects, or has a network link break.  [...]

The 'line break' might occor at any place within the network,
not just at the 'remote end'.
Therefore, the text should better say:

   Tunnels sometimes go down because the remote end crashes,
|  disconnects, or a network link break occurs.  [...]


(7)  Section 11.2

Within the details of step 5, the text on page 38, lacks of a
sub-step label.
The text,

        [...]


(7)  Section 11.2, again

The final paragraph of Section 11.2, on page 39, says:

      SG-A sends the datagram saved at step (5) through the newly
      created tunnel to SG-B, where it gets decrypted and forwarded.
      Bob receives it at (7) and replies at (8).  SG-B already has a
|     tunnel up with G1 and uses it.  [...]
                     ^^
"G1" is undefined; apparently, it should be "SG-A".
Hence, this snippit should say:

      SG-A sends the datagram saved at step (5) through the newly
      created tunnel to SG-B, where it gets decrypted and forwarded.
      Bob receives it at (7) and replies at (8).  SG-B already has a
|     tunnel up with SG-A and uses it.  [...]
                     ^^^^


(8)  Section 12.3

The second paragraph of Section 12.3 (on page 41) says:

   The design of ISAKMP/IKE, and its use of cookies, defend against many
   kinds of denial of service.  [...]

It should say:
                                                           v
|  The design of ISAKMP/IKE, and its use of cookies, defends against
   many kinds of denial of service.  [...]


(9)  General remark

It's a pity that RFC 4322, published a few days *after* the new IPsec
RFCs including the IKEv2 specification (RFC 4306), does not give a
perspective on Opportunistic Encryption in the context of IKEv2.

There are two pretty blatant (albethem amusing) errata in RFC 2028 
(BCP 11), section 3.6:

1. The second sentence of section 3.6 says, "The IAB appoints the 
IETF chair and is responsible for approving other IESG candidates put 
forward by the IETF nominating committee." That's not true (and 
likely due to a transcription error from RFC 1601). RFC 2850 says, 
"Full IAB members, including the IETF chair, are selected and 
appointed according to the procedures defined in [BCP 10] ." RFC 2850 
is clearly correct.

2. The third sentence of section 3.6 says, "The IAB is also 
responsible for reviewing and approving the charters of new Working 
Groups that are proposed for the IETF." RFC 2418 says, "The formation 
of a working group requires a charter which is primarily negotiated 
between a prospective working group Chair and the relevant Area 
Director(s), although final approval is made by the IESG with advice 
from the Internet Architecture Board (IAB)." RFC 2418 is the current 
practice.

Amusing, but errata.

Hello,

I'd like to submit a few comments on the recently published
RFC 4277 (Experience with BGP-4) authored by you, and point
out a couple of typos I found in that document.


(1)  Relationship to RFC 1773

While studying RFC 4277, and re-reading its predecessor, RFC 1773,
it became more and more unclear to me why RFC 1773 has not simply
been declared being obsoleted by RFC 4277 - or perhaps being done
so by RFC 4277 plus RFC 4276.

Almost all material contained in RFC 1773 has been expanded upon
in RFC 4277; only a few historical noted have been dropped -
which arguably are of no more interest from the point of view
of current standardization and implementation efforts.

Hence, RFC 4277 apparently is a perfect replacement for RFC 1773,
and it would have added to clarity about the status of the memos
making this visible in the RFC index by means of a pair of
related  OBSOLETED BY  and  OBSOLETES  notes.


(2)  Inconsistencies with References

There are a few issues with References in RFC 4277:

(2a)

RFC 1965 had been obsoleted by RFC 3065, as noted in the text,
and consistently, the Ref. [RFC1965] has been placed into the
Informative References (Section 22.2), whereas [RFC3065] has
been recorded as a Normative Reference.  That's pretty o.k.

A similar relation exists between RFC 1966 and RFC 2796 (that
had obsoleted the former), and the text contains a similar,
parallel treatment of this RFC pair as the pair noted above.
Nevertheless, the Ref. [RFC1966] has been placed in Section
22.1, Normative References.
That seems to be inappropriate and inconsistent; [RFC1996]
should have been filed as an Informative Reference.

(2b)

The first sentence of Section 3, on page 3, contains a citation to
"[BGP-MIB]" that can be assumed from the context to mean RFC 4273,
but there's no such entry in Section 22 !

Consistently with (2a) above, the Ref. [RFC1657] from Section 22.1
should better have been placed into Section 22.2, and instead of it,
a new entry [BGP-MIB] pointing to RFC 4273 inserted into the
Normative References, Section 22.1.


The following text might be considered for inclusion in an RFC
Errata Note for RFC 4277 to resolve isuues (2a) and (2b):

-----
RFC 4271, in Section 22.1, "Normative References", on page 17,
contains entries labeled  '[RFC1966]'  and  '[RFC1657]' .
These entries should have been placed into Section 22.2,
"Informative References", instead.

Additionally, another entry should be added to Section 22.1 :

   [BGP-MIB]   Haas, J., Ed. and S. Hares, Ed., "Definitions of Managed
               Objects for BGP-4", RFC 4273, January 2006.
-----


(3)  further errata (typos)

(3a)

The example network topology diagram in Section 8, on mid-page 8,

                     /---- transit B ----\
         end-customer                     transit A----
                     /---- transit C ----\

should say:

                     /---- transit B ----\
         end-customer                     transit A----
                     \---- transit C ----/

Rationale: cf. RFC 1773 !

(3b)

Conforming to standard IPsec terminology, the first sentence
in Section 17.2 of RFC 4277 (on page 14),

                                    vvv
   BGP can run over IPsec, either in a tunnel or in transport mode,
   where the TCP portion of the IP packet is encrypted.  [...]

should better say:
                                           vvvvvv
|  BGP can run over IPsec, either in tunnel mode or in transport mode,
   where the TCP portion of the IP packet is encrypted.  [...]

or even, omitting that first 'mode' entirely,

|  BGP can run over IPsec, either in tunnel or in transport mode, where
   the TCP portion of the IP packet is encrypted.  [...]

(3c)

The last sentence in Section 21 of RFC 4277, on page 16,

   Finally, we'd like to think the IDR WG for general and specific input
   that contributed to this document.

should say:
                           v
|  Finally, we'd like to thank the IDR WG for general and specific input
   that contributed to this document.


These issue statements have been prepared for easy cut & paste into an
Errata Note for RFC 4277.


Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hi,

 I was implementing RFC 3376 and got some doubt.
 I posted to the author of the RFC too, but didn't get any response.

 So finally posting to you.
 
In section 5.2 of RFC 3376, 5 sequential steps are given to handle the 
received query from the multicast router.
I feel the following case is not handled properly in these steps

"If new query is Group and Source Specific query and there is pending 
response for this group and recorded source list for the group is empty 
(i.e. previous query was Group Specific query)"

In this case, source list will be cleared as per step 4 of section 5.2. 
But I feel the source list should be recorded to generate the report 
accordingly.
Please look into the matter.

Thanks and Regards
Rajesh Garg

Hi,

  I am confused at the definition in RFC3588(Diameter)

   AVP Format

   <Vendor-Specific-Application-Id> ::=3D < AVP Header: 260 >
                                     1* [ Vendor-Id ]
                                     0*1{ Auth-Application-Id }
                                     0*1{ Acct-Application-Id }
for  1* [ Vendor-Id ], is it required or optional?=20
In my understanding, [ ] represent "optional", which means allowing none =
of=20
this type AVP appear, but 1* means at least one needed, Is it =
inconsistent?
The same problem for 0*1{ Auth-Application-Id } and  0*1{ =
Acct-Application-Id }.

Can it is be issued as RFC bug for RFC errata? Thanks!

Hello,
I'd like to send you a few comments on the recently
published RFC 4450 (Cruft Removal) authored by you.

First of all, thanks for your effort!

After reading the RFC and looking into the changes
performed to rfcxx00.txt, I noticed a few issues.


(1)

Near the top of page 3, section 3 of RFC 4450 states the
reasons for removal from the list -- i.e. *not* moving
to HISTORIC state:
  o  RFC 1584  -- an expected future dependency;
  o  RFC 1755  -- believed to be actively in use.

Nevertheless, these two RFCs have been moved to HISTORIC
status along with the publication of RFC 4450, as can be
seen in rfcxx00.txt .
This is quite surprising. (Perhaps, you know what happened.)

Preferrably, the final RFC text would better have been
coordinated with the actual Standards Actions performed --
for example, by addition of an IESG statement explaining the
deviation from the text.


(2)

Due to the 'numeric limitation' applied (restriction to RFCs
with numbers in the range ~700...2000) there are now a couple
of RFCs that have lost their 'normative background'.

For example, the higher level SNA MIBs (RFCs 2051, (2155->)2455,
2456, 2457, and 2582) more or less depend on the now deprecated
basic SNA node MIBs, RFCs (1665->)1666 and 1747.  [ "xx->yy"
is my shorthand notation for "RFC xx obsoleted by RFC yy". ]
Arguably, in this case, these dependant RFCs might be considered
candidates for a move to HISTORIC as well.
But there certainly are other cases as well (I have not yet
checked all the details).

It therefore should perhaps be considered to repeat the
RFC 4450 'experiment' with an extended numeric range of RFCs,
e.g. up to RFC 2500.


(3)

On the other hand, the restriction to Standards Track documents
has other undesired implications:

a) In the past, usually at least an Experimental RFC has been
published as a first try for a new protocol (or an Informational
RFC, in the case of a third-party protocol), before a Standards
Track version has been developed.  Unfortunately, in this process
it obviously has been avoided very often to formally OBSOLETE
the predecessor RFC[s] when the Standards Track version has been
published.  (Similar undue 'politeness' can be observed, e.g.,
on the transition path of MIBs from SMIv1 to SMIv2.)
Caused by RFC 4450 we now have non-deprecated RFCs predating
RFCs moved to HISTORIC state.
(The example instances I've been aware of at first glance, though
still being listed as EXPERIMENTAL in the RFC index, fortunately
already had been removed in the past from the 'Experimental RFCs'
Section of rfcxx00.txt .)
It would be very useful, for clarity, to move these RFCs to
HISTORIC status as well.

b) There are 'companion documents' to Standards Track RFCs that
have been published as Informational RFCs for various (legitimate)
reasons.  These RFCs are outdated with their respective related
specifications, and as such, for clarity, should better be moved
to HISTORIC status as well.

For example, IMHO the following Informational and Experimental RFCs,
being closely related to RFCs that now have been deprecated, should
be considered candidates for deprecation (being made HISTORIC) as
well, for clarity, consistency, and/or historical context:

o  RFC 1477 (IDPR Introduction);
o  RFC 1482 (NSFNET Policy-Based Routing Database) -- IDPR related;
o  RFC 1585 (MOSPF Analysis and Experience) -- depending on RFC 1584;
o  RFC 1593 (SNA APPN Node MIB) -- 1st ed., eff.->2155->4255;
o  RFC 1634 (IPX over WAN Media) -- successor to RFC 1551, the siblings
            of which (RFCs 1552 and 1553) have been made HISTORIC;
o  RFC 1791 (TCP+UDP over IPX);     \  both still in
o  RFC 1792 (TCP/IPX MIB);          /  rfcxx00.txt !
o  RFC 1834 (WHOIS++ Introduction);
o  RFC 1875 (UNINETT PCA Policy) -- based on PEM.

It might therefore perhaps be useful to perform a RFC 4450 like
'experiment' for Informational and Experimental RFCs as well.


(4)

The restriction in the RFC 4450 effort on Proposed Standards
detracts from the fact that there are [Full] Standard RFCs as
well which are clearly outdated, or of questionable quality and/or
precision.
My personal (incomplete) hot list of candidates comprises:
     STDs 15, 16, 17, 19, 35, 40, 42, 44, 49
(Other legacy Standards doubtlessly should be updated, e.g.
STDs 5, 7, 13.)

Note: In particular the situation with STDs 16+17 is annoying.
      Replacements are established, but vendors do not switch
      to SMIv2 and the newer MIBs (and do not offer SNMPv3,
      with its improved security features!) because these old
      specifications are still listed as Standard.

I also strongly suspect that there are a few Draft Standard RFCs
that might be considered outdated.

It therefore might be worth repeating the RFC 4450 'experiment'
for Draft and Full Standards as well.


Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,

reading the recently published RFC 4294 edited by you,
I unfortunately find a couple of issues in the text --
it has not been adapted completely and consistently to the
current valid set of documents that should be referenced.


(1) Page 7, Section 4.4

The RFC 4294 text says:

  4.4.  ICMP for the Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) - RFC 2463

     ICMPv6 [RFC-2463] MUST be supported.

It should say:

  4.4.  ICMP for the Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) - RFC 4443

     ICMPv6 [RFC-4443] MUST be supported.

The title of Section 4.4 in the Table of Contents should be
adapted accordingly.

Rationale: RFC 4443 (replacing and obsoleting RFC 2463) has been
published exactly 3 weeks before RFC 4294, and hence should be
used as the currently valid reference.


(2) Page 7, Section 4.5.1

RFC 4294 says:

  4.5.1.  IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture - RFC 3513

     The IPv6 Addressing Architecture [RFC-3513] MUST be supported as
     updated by [RFC-3879].

It should say:

  4.5.1.  IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture - RFC 4291

     The IPv6 Addressing Architecture [RFC-4291] MUST be supported.

Rationale: RFC 4291 (replacing and obsoleting RFC 3513, and thereby
incorporating RFC 3879) has been published more than 8 weeks before
RFC 4294, and hence should be used as the currently valid reference.


(3) Page 8, Section 5.1

RFC 4294 says:

     DNS is described in [RFC-1034], [RFC-1035], [RFC-3152], [RFC-3363],
     and [RFC-3596].  [...]

It should say:

     DNS is described in [RFC-1034], [RFC-1035], [RFC-3363], and
     [RFC-3596].  [...]

And subsequently, where RFC 4294 says,

  -  reverse addressing in ip6.arpa using PTR records [RFC-3152];

it should say:

  -  reverse addressing in ip6.arpa using PTR records [RFC-3596];

Rationale: RFC 3152 has been obsoleted and incorporated into RFC 3596.


(4) Page 10, Section 6.1.1

RFC 4294 says:

  6.1.1.  Transition Mechanisms for IPv6 Hosts and Routers - RFC 2893

It should say:

  6.1.1.  Transition Mechanisms for IPv6 Hosts and Routers - RFC 4213

Rationale: RFC 4213 (replacing and obsoleting RFC 2893) has been
published more than 6 months before RFC 4294, and hence should be
used consistently as the currently valid reference.  (The text body
of the section has been updated accordingly, before publication.)


(5) Page 11, Section 8.2

RFC 4294 says:

  8.2.  Security Protocols

     ESP [RFC-4303] MUST be supported.  AH [RFC-4302] MUST be supported.

It should say:

  8.2.  Security Protocols

     ESP [RFC-4303] MUST be supported.  AH [RFC-4302] MAY be supported.

Rationale: The new IPsec RFCs purposely have changed the requirement
level for AH.  From RFC 4301, page 9, 1st paragraph of Section 3.2 :

               [...]  IPsec implementations MUST support ESP and MAY
   support AH. (Support for AH has been downgraded to MAY because
   experience has shown that there are very few contexts in which ESP
   cannot provide the requisite security services.  Note that ESP can be
   used to provide only integrity, without confidentiality, making it
   comparable to AH in most contexts.)

In Section 13, RFC 4301 lists the differences from RFC 2401,
and it states on page 74:

   o Support for AH in both IPv4 and IPv6 is no longer required.

RFC 4294 does not give any arguments to override these statements.

(The IPsec references in RFC 4294 apparently have been changed
 shortly before publication without due adaptation of the text.)


(6) Section 12.1, Normative References :

- The reference [RFC-2463] should be replaced by a reference to
  RFC 4443 according to item (1) above.

- The reference [RFC-3152] (last item on page 14) should be deleted.
  That RFC has been obsoleted long time ago, and the material has been
  incorporated into RFC 3596 (see the entry [RFC-3596] on page 15)
  according to item (3) above.

- The reference [RFC-3513] should be replaced by an entry [RFC-4291],
  containing the proper reference to RFC 4291, according to item (2)
  above.

- The reference [RFC-3879] is not needed any more according to
  item (2) above; the material from RFC 3879 has been incorporated
  into RFC 4291, the successor of RFC 3513 -- see item (2) above.


I recommend to post an Errata Note for RFC 4294 to record these
issues.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
reading the recently published RFC 4389 authored by you,
I found a few textual issues I'd like to report.


(1)  typo??

The last paragraph of section 5 of RFC 4389, on page 12, says:

   A receives this NA, processing it as usual.  Hence it creates a
   neighbor entry for B on interface 2 in the REACHABLE state and
   records the link-layer address p1.

Since the packet described has been sent out by node P, on its
interface '1', to node A, and A has only a single interface
involved in the scenarion, with link layer address 'a' (as explained
at the beginning of section 5), "on interface 2" is improper in the
snippit above.  (This may be the result of incomplete adaptation
after a copy-and-paste operation.)  A minimal correction to resolve
this issue might be to name the receive interface by its link layer
address, hence changing the text above to say:

   A receives this NA, processing it as usual.  Hence it creates a
   neighbor entry for B on interface 'a' in the REACHABLE state and
   records the link-layer address p1.

or alternatively, more detailed:

   A receives this NA, processing it as usual.  Hence it creates a
   neighbor entry for B on the interface with link layer address 'a'
   in the REACHABLE state and records the link-layer address p1.


(2)  typo!

The 3rd paragraph of Section 9, on page 13, says:

   This document does not introduce any new mechanisms for the
   protection of proxy Neighbor Discovery.  That is, it does not provide
   a mechanism from authorizing certain devices to act as proxies, and
   it does not provide extensions to SEND to make it possible to use
   both SEND and proxies at the same time.  [...]

It should perhaps better say ( applying 's/from/for/' ) :

   This document does not introduce any new mechanisms for the
   protection of proxy Neighbor Discovery.  That is, it does not provide
|  a mechanism for authorizing certain devices to act as proxies, and
   it does not provide extensions to SEND to make it possible to use
   both SEND and proxies at the same time.  [...]


(3)  outdated reference

In Section 11, Normative References, RFC 4389 contains the entry
(on page 14) [ICMPv6], pointing to RFC 2463.
But exactly 3 weeks before RFC 4389, RFC 4443 has been published
obsoleting and replacing RFC 2463.  Hence that entry should have
been updated to properly point to RFC 4443 instead.


If you agree with my 'diagnosis', I recommend that you submit an
Author's Errata Note for RFC 4389 covering the three issues
listed above.  But if you prefer, I can instead submit an Errata
Note on my own, with your consent mailed to the RFC-Editor.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,

I would like to send you a few comments on the recently published
RFC 4443 (ICMPv6) authored by you.
[ Since there is no email address given in the Authors' Addresses
  section of the RFC for Stephen Deering, I cannot copy this
  message to him; please forward it if you can -- thanks! ]

Below, item (1) is a significant issue, and thus presented first.
The subsequent items are less significant and given in textual order.


(1)  text omission ???

I suspect that something went wrong in the publication process
for RFC 4443, leading to significant text omission.

Symptoms:

o  Text on top of page 5 apparently *continues* specifications
   that are not in the published text;

o  Appendix A contains the change item:

   - Added specification that all ICMP error messages shall have exactly
     32 bits of type-specific data, so that receivers can reliably find
     the embedded invoking packet even when they don't recognize the
     ICMP message Type.

   I could not find any text in the body of the RFC corresponding
   to this statement.

Therefore, I suspect that general specifications for ICMPv6 error
messages have been dropped inadvertently from the end of Section
2.1, at the bottom of page 4 in the published text, or that even
a subsection dealing with the peculiar requirements for ICMPv6
error messages has been dropped, just leaving in the published text
the single sentence at top of page 5.

I expect the missing text to depict the general structure of the
Message Body of ICMPv6 error messages with all related explanations,
according to the above mentioned change note.

Appendix A also states:

   - Removed the general packet format from Section 2.1.  It refers to
     Sections 3 and 4 for packet formats now.

This is not literally true.  The general format *is* in Section 2.1.
But in fact, it would be logical to have the (missing) specifications
for error messages -- including the 4 lines of test on top of page 5 --
incorporated into (the start of) Section 3 (*before* the heading for
Section 3.1.) instead of the end of Section 2.1.


(2)  possible textual improvement

in the lower third of page 3, Section 2.1 says:

   The code field depends on the message type.  It is used to create an
   additional level of message granularity.

It should perhaps better say:

   The code field depends on the message type.  It is used to create an
   additional level of message type granularity.
                              ^^^^^^

(3)  reference to old IPsec Architecture document

Section 5.1, at the bottom of page 15, has been updated to point
to the new IPsec Architecture document, RFC 4301, via the reference
tag [SEC-ARCH].  But immediately below, in the first paragraph of
Section 5.2, on top of page 16, the RFC text says:

   ICMP messages may be subject to various attacks.  A complete
   discussion can be found in the IP Security Architecture [IPv6-SA].
   [...]

It remains unclear why the reference is made to the previous IPsec
Architecture document, RFC 2401, in this case.
In fact, RFC 4301 has simplified ICMP handling by the introduction
of ICMP Type+Code as a Traffic Selector for the SPD, and therefore
contains restructured text on ICMP message processing.
Nevertheless, as far as I can see, RFC 4301 has not removed
significant ICMP security related material from RFC 2401.
Thus, IMHO there is no reason to explicitely refer to the obsoleted
specification, RFC 2401 [IPv6-SA], instead of the current one,
RFC 4301 [SEC-ARCH].


(4)  more issues with references

According to Appendix A, RFC 4443 has

   - Separated References into Normative and Informative.

The latest RFC Authoring Internet draft revisions
(cf. draft-rfc-editor-rfc2223bis-xx
 and draft-hoffman-rfc-author-guide-01)
all have included the definition:
     Normative references specify documents that must be read
     to understand or implement the technology in the document,
     or whose technology must be present for the technology in
     the new RFC to work.  [...] an informative reference might
     provide background or historical information to the reader.
     [...]

The separation performed does not match this definition.

(4a)
RFC 4443 refers to RFC 792 and RFC 1122 to point out the analogy
to ICMP[v4], but it is a self-contained specification, and ICMPv6
does not rely on the implementation of ICMP[v4] -- IPv6 only nodes
are possible and even expected for the (far?) future.
Therefore, the references [RFC-792] and [RFC-1122] should better
have been placed into section 7.2, Informative References, instead
of Section 7.1, Normative References.

(4b)
RFC 4443 also lists in Section 7.1, Normative References, the
reference to its obsoleted predecessor, RFC 2463 [RFC-2463].
This is a fatal lock on the Standards Track for RFC 4443:
RFC 4443 can *not* be advanced above the level of RFC 2463,
if the written procedures are taken literally !
(Also, RFC 4443 contains all material from RFC 2463, and thus
RFC 2463 is not needed to understand and/or implement RFC 4443.)

Therefore, all references to obsoleted documents should be
named Informative, and in the case of RFC 4443, [RFC-2463]
should have been moved into Section 7.2 as well.

(4c)
The old IPv6 Addressing Architecture document, RFC 3513, has been
replaced by RFC 4291, published more than 5 weeks before RFC 4443.

Therefore, in Section 7.2 of RFC 4443, the Informative Reference
[IPv6-ADDR] should be have been changed to point to RFC 4291
instead of the obsolete RFC 3513.

(4d)
When following my recommendations in item (3) above, the
Informative Reference [IPv6-SA] is not needed any more;
its role has been taken over by the Reference [SEC-ARCH].


(5)  misleading change note

The second bulleted item in Appendix A,

   - Corrected typos in Section 2.4, where references to sub-bullet e.2
     were supposed to be references to e.3.

apparently is not correct; it must have been introduced in the
draft history, referring to a change in the draft.
The references in RFC 2463 to sub-bullet (e.2) were correct.
RFC 4443 has inserted a new item (e.2) into the list, incrementing
the numbers of the previous sub-bullet (e.2) and all subsequent
sub-bullets, thus making it necessary to increment the references.
Perhaps, the latter had not been done in an early draft revision,
and has then been corrected in a later one.
Thus, the above change note should not have been included in RFC 4443.


Please resolve issue (1) and decide together with the RFC-Editor
whether an immediate update to RFC 4443 should be strived for or
an RFC Errata Note is considered sufficient to fix that issue.
In the former case, issues (2)..(5) could also be addressed in
the update; otherwise they should also be resolved in that note.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Dear Sirs,


I would like to report a small error in RFC 3454:

Appendix C says: 

"C. Prohibition tables

   The tables in this appendix consist of lines with one prohibited code
   point per line.  The format of the lines are the value of the code
   point, a semicolon, and a comment which is the name of the code
   point."


This is not true as the tables in this appendix consist of lines with
one prohibited code point _range_ per line.  The format of the lines
are the value of the starting code point of the range, a hyphen,
the value of the ending code point of the range, a semicolon,
and a comment which is the informal name of the range in square brackets.
If the range contains only one code point, then the hyphen and the ending
code point value are omitted, and the comment contains the name of
the code point without brackets.




Thanks and best regards,

Hello,
I just read the recently published RFC 4407 authored by you.

Unfortunately, that RFC adds to the trouble of mis-used
terminology from the Internet Message Format (IMF) framework;
it repeatedly confuses the precisely defined terms, `header`,
`header field', and `header field body`.

The most recent summary of the IETF standardized IMF terminology
(from RFC 2822 et al.) can be found on page 3 of RFC 4249:


 3.1.1.  Standard Terminology

   Terms related to the Internet Message Format are defined in
   [N2.RFC2822].  Authors specifying extension header fields should use
   the same terms in the same manner in order to provide clarity and
*  avoid confusion.  For example, a "header" [I1.FYI18], [N2.RFC2822] is
*  comprised of "header fields", each of which has a "field name" and
*  usually has a "field body".  Each message may have multiple
*  "headers", viz. a message header and MIME-part [N4.RFC2046] headers.

*  A message header has a Date header field (i.e., a field with field
*  name "Date").  However, there is no "Date header"; use of such non-
*  standard terms is likely to lead to confusion, possibly resulting in
*  interoperability failures of implementations.


For details, see Sections 2.1 and 2.2 of RFC 2822 and other places.
I also recommend the terminology sections in RFC 4021 and RFC 3864.


To correct the terminological issues in RFC 4407,
the following Errata Note should be published:

------ cut here ------

(1)
On page 3 of RFC 4407, the third paragraph,

   Note that the results of this algorithm are only as truthful as the
   headers contained in the message; if a message contains fraudulent or
   incorrect headers, this algorithm will yield an incorrect result.
   [...]

should say:

   Note that the results of this algorithm are only as truthful as the
|  header fields contained in the message; if a message contains
|  fraudulent or incorrect header fields, this algorithm will yield an
   incorrect result.
   [...]


(2)
On page 3, the first sentence in Section 2,

   The PRA of a message is determined by the following algorithm:

should say more precisely:

   The PRA of a message is determined by the following algorithm,
   applied to the message header (i.e., the first mail header within
   the message, in case of a MIME message):


(3)
Subsequently, within the description of the six steps of the
algorithm (on page 3/4), the term `header` should always be replaced
by `header field`, and `headers` should always be replaced by
`header fields` (total of 16 occurrences).


(4)
On page 4 (just below the emumerated algorithm steps), the paragraph,

   For the purposes of this algorithm, a header field is "non-empty" if
   and only if it contains any non-whitespace characters.  Header fields
   that are otherwise relevant but contain only whitespace are ignored
   and treated as if they were not present.

should say:

   For the purposes of this algorithm, a header field is "non-empty" if
|  and only if its body contains any non-whitespace characters.  Header
|  fields that are otherwise relevant but contain only whitespace bodies
   are ignored and treated as if they were not present.

(5)
Immediately following the paragraph mentioned above in item (4), still
on page 4, the substitutions from item (3) above should be applied to
the next two paragraphs and the last paragraph of Section 2 as well
(total of 8 occurrences).


(6)
On page 5, the first paragraph of section 3,

   The PRA, as described by this document, is extracted from message
   headers that have historically not been verified.  Thus, anyone using
   the PRA for any purpose MUST be aware that the headers from which it
   is derived might be fraudulent, malicious, malformed, and/or
   incorrect.  [...]

should say (apply item (3) above twice):

   The PRA, as described by this document, is extracted from message
|  header fields that have historically not been verified.  Thus, anyone
|  using the PRA for any purpose MUST be aware that the header fields
   from which it is derived might be fraudulent, malicious, malformed,
   and/or incorrect.  [...]

and the second paragraph of Section 3,

   A message's PRA will often be extracted from a header field that is
   not normally displayed by existing mail user agent software.  If the
   PRA is used as part of a mechanism to authenticate the message's
   origin, the message SHOULD NOT be displayed with an indication of its

should say:

   not normally displayed by existing mail user agent software.  If the
   PRA is used as part of a mechanism to authenticate the message's
   origin, the message SHOULD NOT be displayed with an indication of its

Hello,

I don't know if it is the right place to report this, but I've found a =
minor typo in rfc2152.txt. The word ''end'' is probably missing in the =
red line (''...thus, a Unicode ....at the END of the line'').

      Rule 2: (Unicode shifted encoding) Any Unicode character sequence
      may be encoded using a sequence of characters in set B, when
      preceded by the shift character "+" (US-ASCII character value
      decimal 43). The "+" signals that subsequent octets are to be
      interpreted as elements of the Modified Base64 alphabet until a
      character not in that alphabet is encountered. Such characters
      include control characters such as carriage returns and line
      feeds; thus, a Unicode shifted sequence always terminates at the
      of a line. As a special case, if the sequence terminates with the
      character "-" (US-ASCII decimal 45) then that character is
      absorbed; other terminating characters are not absorbed and are
      processed normally.

Hello,

I'd like to submit a few comments on the recently published
RFC 4409 authored by you.

First of all, the updates to RFC 2476 are welcome.

But there are still a few issues with the text:


(1)  Section 7 - Interaction with SMTP Extensions

The list of SMTP extensions provided on page 10 of RFC 4409
unfortunately is incomplete.  As far as I can see, the following
RFCs with SMTP extensions predate the publication of RFC 4409:

  o  RFC 2645  -- ATRN
  o  RFC 2852  -- DELIVERBY
  o  RFC 3865 (+ RFC 4095)  -- NO-SOLICITING
  o  RFC 4141  -- CONPERM, CONNEG
[ o  RFC 4405 ]

Quickly browsing these RFCs, I found that only RFC 4405 has
followed the specification in Section 7 of RFC 2476 (literally
carried over to RFC 4409):

   Future SMTP extensions SHOULD explicitly specify if they are valid on
   the Submission port.

and contains a definitive statement to this end.
RFC 4405 therefore arguably might be excluded from the list.

It would have been useful to have a complete list, with the
proper applicability keywords for the above SMTP extensions.


(2)  Issues with References

a) Section 12 of RFC 4409 contains the entry:

   [ESMTP]           Klensin, J., Freed, N., Rose, M., Stefferud, E.,
                     and D. Crocker, "SMTP Service Extensions", STD 10,
                     RFC 1869, November 1995.

   `STD 10` in fact should be `(ex) STD 10` according to rfcxx00.txt .
   The material from RFC 1869 has been incorporated into RFC 2821,
   and RFC 1869 has been reclassified to Historic.

   Therefore, this reference should not have been listed as a
   Normative Reference.  The Ref. to RFC 2821 in fact catches all.


   Section 12 of RFC 4409, under [SMTP-MTA] also contains the entry:

                     Partridge, C., "Mail routing and the domain
                     system", STD 10, RFC 974, January 1986.

   `STD 10` in fact should better have been `(ex) STD 14` --
   rfcxx00.txt says: "Now Historic."                  ^^

   The non-obsolete material from RFC 974 has been incorporated
   into RFC 2821 and RFC 974 has been reclassified as Historic.

   Therefore, this reference should not have been listed as a
   Normative Reference.  The Ref. to RFC 2821 in fact catches all.


   Finally, the subsequent entry,

                     Braden, R., "Requirements for Internet Hosts -
                     Application and Support", STD 3, RFC 1123, October
                     1989.

   also is not needed any more, because the SMTP related material
   in RFC 1123 has been revised and incorporated into RFC 2821
   as well.  The Ref. to RFC 2821 in fact catches all.


b) Section 13 of RFC 4409, under [MESSAGE-FORMAT] contains the entry:

                     Braden, R., "Requirements for Internet Hosts -
                     Application and Support", STD 3, RFC 1123, October
                     1989.

   Similarly to the last item above, the IMF related material from
   RFC 1233 has been revised and incorporated into RFC 2822; thus
   this Ref. is not really needed any more.
   The Ref. to RFC 2822 in fact catches all.


c) Section 13 of RFC 4409 contains the entry:

   [IPSEC]           Kent, S. and R. Atkinson, "Security Architecture
                     for the Internet Protocol", RFC 2401, November
                     1998.

   This Ref. was already outdated at the time of publication of
   RFC 4409; it should point to the current IPSEC Architecture
   document, RFC 4301 !

   BTW:
   This apparently is a `viral` legacy issue -- RFC 2476 also
   contained an outdated Ref., to the predecessor of RFC 2401 !



Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hi.

It has come to my attention that there are at least three errors in
RFC4408.

1) On page 1, in the IESG notes, "aParticipants" should be
   "Participants".

2) On page 40, the US-ASCII normative reference has an incorrectly
   indented second paragraph.  Instead of:

   [US-ASCII] American National Standards Institute (formerly United
              States of America Standards Institute), "USA Code for
              Information Interchange, X3.4", 1968.

   ANSI X3.4-1968 has been replaced by newer versions with slight
              modifications, but the 1968 version remains definitive for
              the Internet.

   it should be:

   [US-ASCII] American National Standards Institute (formerly United
              States of America Standards Institute), "USA Code for
              Information Interchange, X3.4", 1968.

              ANSI X3.4-1968 has been replaced by newer versions with
              slight modifications, but the 1968 version remains
              definitive for the Internet.


3) On page 46, the DNS zone file example incorrectly had line breaks
   removed.

   Instead of:
              
   $ORIGIN _spf.example.com.  mary.mobile-users                   A
   127.0.0.2 fred.mobile-users                   A 127.0.0.2
   15.15.168.192.joel.remote-users     A 127.0.0.2
   16.15.168.192.joel.remote-users     A 127.0.0.2

   it should be:

   $ORIGIN _spf.example.com.
   mary.mobile-users                   A 127.0.0.2
   fred.mobile-users                   A 127.0.0.2
   15.15.168.192.joel.remote-users     A 127.0.0.2
   16.15.168.192.joel.remote-users     A 127.0.0.2


All of these were correct in the original text submitted to the
rfc-editor and the errors were the result of the rfc editing process.
The first error, Meng and I couldn't have even known about because we
were never given the chance to review the IESG note for errors.
Fortunately, I don't think either of the other two errors are very
serious.

To whom it may concern:

On page 4 of RFC 4501, the authors write:

   In particular, the "dnsname" field of the DNS URI is to be
   considered an internationalized domain name (IDN) unaware
   domain name slot, in the terminology of RFC 3940 [14].

Reference 14 is RFC 3490 not RFC 3940.

Hello,

reading the recently published STD 67, RFC 4506, I unfortunately
found a few textual issues left over in the published text.
The notes below might be considered for an RFC Errata Note.


(1) Section 6.2, page 18 - typo (word omission)

The words in the 9th line of the text,

    [...] "followed by one or hexadecimal digits" [...]

should say:

    [...] "followed by one or more hexadecimal digits" [...]
                             ^^^^^^

(2) Section 8, 2nd paragraph (page 22) - typo

The RFC says:

   Care must be take to properly encode and decode data to avoid
   attacks.  [...]

it should say:
                    vv
   Care must be taken to properly encode and decode data to avoid
   attacks.  [...]


(3) Subtle inconsistency between Section 6.1 and Section 6.2

On page 17, Section 6.1 states the Notational Convention:

   (2) Terminal symbols are strings of characters surrounded by
       double quotes.
       ^^^^^^
Nevertheless, throughout the new Section 6.2 (on page 18), all
terminal symbols, e.g. the "generalized digits" -- the terminals
to build octal, decimal, and hexadecimal constants, are specified
as characters surrounded by *single* quotes.
                             ^^^^^^
Although this style perhaps was inspired by the `C` language,
IMHO, its use is inconsistent in that context.


Please comment.
I propose to post an RFC Errata Note, for inclusion on the RFC
Errata web page at the RFC Editor's web site, at least to cover
item (1) and item (2) above.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
reading the recently published RFC 4448 authored by you,
I found two issues worth being commented.


(1)  a subtle typo

Section 4.5 of RFC 4448, on top of page 12, says:

   The Ethernet PW management model follows the general PW management
   model defined in [RFC3985] and [PWE3-MIB].  Many common PW management
   facilities are provided here, with no additional Ethernet specifics
   necessary.  Ethernet-specific parameters are defined in an additional
   MIB module, [PW-MIB].

It should say, replacing "here" by "there":

   The Ethernet PW management model follows the general PW management
   model defined in [RFC3985] and [PWE3-MIB].  Many common PW management
|  facilities are provided there, with no additional Ethernet specifics
   necessary.  Ethernet-specific parameters are defined in an additional
   MIB module, [PW-MIB].


(2)  terminological issue / violation of reference model

Section 4.4.1 of RFC 4448, on pp. 9/10, says:

--- snip ---
   When the PE receives an Ethernet frame, and the frame has a VLAN tag,
   we can distinguish two cases:

      1. The tag is service-delimiting.  This means that the tag was
         placed on the frame by some piece of service provider-operated
         equipment, and the tag is used by the service provider to
         distinguish the traffic.  For example, LANs from different
         customers might be attached to the same service provider
         switch, which applies VLAN tags to distinguish one customer's
         traffic from another's, and then forwards the frames to the PE.

      2. The tag is not service-delimiting.  This means that the tag was
         placed in the frame by a piece of customer equipment, and is
         not meaningful to the PE.

   Whether or not the tag is service-delimiting is determined by local
   configuration on the PE.
--- snip ---

IMHO, this is a very unfortunate explanation.

a) The term, "service delimiting", apparently here is defined
   by the origin of the tag, not by its function.
   I do not believe that this is the appropriate way to deal with;
   later on in RFC 4448, it (reasonably) seems to be permitted
   that a service-delimiting tag has been provided by a CE device!

b) The situation described in bullet 1), with a provider owned
   switch, removes the PW terminating entity from the provider
   *edge*, turning it from a "PE" device into a "P" device,
   which is highly inconsistent with the service model developed
   in Section 1 of RFC 4448, and leads to a clash in terminology.
   To stay within that model, the "coloring" function described
   in bullet 1) must conceptionally be performed by the NSP
   function *within* the (PW terminating) PE device. (And it might
   as well be performed in customer equipment, i.e. at the CE.)

Perhaps, the above text should be improved.
I'll try at a first proposal:

--- snip ---
   When the PE receives an Ethernet frame, and the frame has a VLAN tag,
   we can distinguish two cases:

      1. The tag is service-delimiting.
	 This means that the tag was introduced for the single purpose
	 of identifying the frame for the PW service, e.g., to select a
	 specific PW for transmission of the frame.  A service-
	 delimiting tag may have been added on the CE side or in the
         (conceptual) NSP function of the PE edge.
	 Ordinarily, any service-delimiting tag will not be transmitted
	 over the PW, i.e., it will be removed before PW encapsulation.

      2. The tag is not service-delimiting.  This means that the tag is
         not meaningful to the PW endpoints and must be transmitted over
	 the PW.
	 Such tag usually was placed in the frame by a piece of customer
	 equipment, but it might as well be added or modified by the NSP
	 function of the PW terminating PE device.

   Whether or not the tag is service-delimiting is determined by local
   configuration on the PE.
--- snip ---


Perhaps, both issues should be addressed by an RFC Errata Note.
But for item (2), discussion is required before such submission,
so please comment.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,

studying the recently published RFC 4346 authored/edited by you
I found a couple of issues I'd like to report.
(Some of these issues in fact are legacy issues from RFC 2246.)

All excerpts from the RFC text are taken keeping their original
formatting, and modified text is formatted in conformance with
RFC guidelines again.

I use change bars ('|' in column 1) and casual up/down pointing
tags ('^^^' / 'vvv' marks in extra lines) to emphasize the location
of textual issues and/or proposed textual enhancements/corrections.


Content issues
==============

(C1)  inconsistent specification of requirements

Section 7.2.2 of RFC 4346, on page 28 says:

   bad_record_mac
      This alert is returned if a record is received with an incorrect
      MAC.  This alert also MUST be returned if an alert is sent because
      a TLSCiphertext decrypted in an invalid way: either it wasn't an
      even multiple of the block length, or its padding values, when
      checked, weren't correct.  This message is always fatal.

and then continues:

   decryption_failed
      This alert MAY be returned if a TLSCiphertext decrypted in an
      invalid way: either it wasn't an even multiple of the block
      length, or its padding values, when checked, weren't correct.
      This message is always fatal.

The "MUST" in the former paragraph turns the second paragraph void
because the precondition clauses are identical.  I strongly suspect
that it was intended to specify a "SHOULD" requirement in the first
clause, with the 'fallback' "MAY" clause in the second paragraph.
Therefore, the first clause above should probably say:

   bad_record_mac
      This alert is returned if a record is received with an incorrect
      MAC.
|     This alert also SHOULD be returned if an alert is sent because
      a TLSCiphertext decrypted in an invalid way: either it wasn't an
      even multiple of the block length, or its padding values, when
      checked, weren't correct.  This message is always fatal.

[I have inserted an additional line break after the first sentence,
 both to clearly separate the two usage cases, and to keep the line
 formatting of the subsequent lines unchanged.]


(C2)  imprecise data description for `ciphersuites`

Section 7.4.1.2, on page 37 defines the syntax:

      uint8 CipherSuite[2];    /* Cryptographic suite selector */

According to the specifications given in Section 4.3, vectors
of type CipherSuite strictly must have byte lengths being a
multiple of 2.
This also means that the upper bound for a varaiable-length array
of type CipherSuite should always be a multiple of 2.
Hence, the declaration in Section 7.4.1.2, on top of page 38,

      struct {
          ProtocolVersion client_version;
          Random random;
          SessionID session_id;
          CipherSuite cipher_suites<2..2^16-1>;
          CompressionMethod compression_methods<1..2^8-1>;
      } ClientHello;

should better say:

      struct {
          ProtocolVersion client_version;
          Random random;
          SessionID session_id;
|         CipherSuite cipher_suites<2..2^16-2>;
          CompressionMethod compression_methods<1..2^8-1>;
      } ClientHello;

This issue recurs in Appendix A.4.1 (2nd line from bottom of p.57)
and at various places in other TLS RFCs, in particular in RFC 4347
and RFC 4366 -- see my errata messages for these RFCs.

Historical Note:
  In SSL 2.0, the CipherSuite construct was 3 bytes long.
  Because 3 divides 2^16-1,  <3..2^16-1>  was an appropriate size
  range then.  The issue has been introduced with SSL 3.0.


(C3)  missing Reference

Appendix B, at the bottom of page 66, contains the Glossary item:

   RC2
      A block cipher developed by Ron Rivest at RSA Data Security, Inc.
      [RSADSI] described in [RC2].

There is no such Reference "[RSADSI]" in the Informative References
Section, on pp. 82 ff. -- apparently, it has been prematurely deleted
from RFC 2246.  Perhaps, nothing would be lost when replacing the
above Glossary item by:

   RC2
      A block cipher developed by Ron Rivest described in [RC2].


(C4)  Outdated Normative Reference

RFC 4346 has been jointly published with RFC 4366, which has
obsoleted RFC 3546.
Therefore, it would have been much more consistent to replace,
in the Normative References Section, on page 82, the entry:

   [TLSEXT]   Blake-Wilson, S., Nystrom, M., Hopwood, D., Mikkelsen, J.,
              and T. Wright, "Transport Layer Security (TLS)
              Extensions", RFC 3546, June 2003.

by:

   [TLSEXT]   Blake-Wilson, S., Nystrom, M., Hopwood, D., Mikkelsen, J.,
              and T. Wright, "Transport Layer Security (TLS)
|             Extensions", RFC 4366, April 2006.
                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

(C5)  unexpected / inappropriate Reference

Page 83 contains the inappropriate Informative Reference:

   [TCP]      Hellstrom, G. and P. Jones, "RTP Payload for Text
              Conversation", RFC 4103, June 2005.

This clearly should be:

|  [TCP]      Postel, J., "Transmission Control Protocol", STD 7,
|             RFC 793, September 1981.

(Cf. the single citation to [TCP], in the first paragraph of Section 1,
on page 4.)


Simple textual issues (errata)
==============================

(E1)  typo

The second paragraph of Section 3 of RFC 4346, on page 6, says:

   This document is not intended to supply any details of service
   definition or of interface definition, although it does cover select
   areas of policy as they are required for the maintenance of solid
   security.

It should perhaps say:

   This document is not intended to supply any details of service
   definition or of interface definition, although it does cover
|  selected areas of policy as they are required for the maintenance of
   solid security.

(E2)  copy-and-paste error (?)

At the bottom of page 11, Section 4.7 of RFC 4346 says:

   In public key encryption, a public key algorithm is used to encrypt
   data in such a way that it can be decrypted only with the matching
   private key.  A public-key-encrypted element is encoded as an opaque
   vector <0..2^16-1>, where the length is specified by the signing
   algorithm and key.

It should say:

   In public key encryption, a public key algorithm is used to encrypt
   data in such a way that it can be decrypted only with the matching
   private key.  A public-key-encrypted element is encoded as an opaque
|  vector <0..2^16-1>, where the length is specified by the encrypting
   algorithm and key.
                                                            ^^^^^^^^^^

(E3)  typo

The beginning of the first paragraph of Section 6.1, on page 15,

   A TLS connection state is the operating environment of the TLS Record
   Protocol.  It specifies a compression algorithm, and encryption
   algorithm, and a MAC algorithm.  In addition, the parameters for

should say (replacing "and" by "an"):

   A TLS connection state is the operating environment of the TLS Record
|  Protocol.  It specifies a compression algorithm, an encryption
   algorithm, and a MAC algorithm.  In addition, the parameters for


(E4)  word twister

Near the bottom of page 15, Section 6.1 says:

   compression algorithm
      An algorithm to be used for data compression.  This specification
      must include all information the algorithm requires compression.

It should perhaps say:

   compression algorithm
      An algorithm to be used for data compression.  This specification
|     must include all information the compression algorithm requires.


(E5)  improper indentation

In Section 7.4.1.1, on page 36, a headline is indented too much;
the text,

         Structure of this message:

             struct { } HelloRequest;

   Note: This message MUST NOT be included ...

should say:

|  Structure of this message:

             struct { } HelloRequest;

   Note: This message MUST NOT be included ...


(E6)  improper line (un)folding and irregular indentation

In Section 7.4.1.2, at the bottom of page 36, the text,

      struct {
         uint32 gmt_unix_time;
         opaque random_bytes[28];
      } Random;

   gmt_unix_time The current time and date in standard UNIX 32-bit
      format (seconds since the midnight starting Jan 1, 1970, GMT,
      ignoring leap seconds) according to the sender's internal clock.
      Clocks are not required to be set correctly by the basic TLS
      Protocol; higher-level or application protocols may define
      additional requirements.

         random_bytes
             28 bytes generated by a secure random number generator.

following the layout style followed in the remainder of the document
should be formatted as:

      struct {
         uint32 gmt_unix_time;
         opaque random_bytes[28];
      } Random;

|  gmt_unix_time
|     The current time and date in standard UNIX 32-bit
      format (seconds since the midnight starting Jan 1, 1970, GMT,
      ignoring leap seconds) according to the sender's internal clock.
      Clocks are not required to be set correctly by the basic TLS
      Protocol; higher-level or application protocols may define
      additional requirements.

|  random_bytes
|     28 bytes generated by a secure random number generator.


(E7)  improper line (un)folding

The last paragraph of Section 7.4.1.3, on page 40,

   compression_method The single compression algorithm selected by the
      server from the list in ClientHello.compression_methods.  For
      resumed sessions this field is the value from the resumed session
      state.

consistently should be formatted as:

|  compression_method
|     The single compression algorithm selected by the server from the
      list in ClientHello.compression_methods.  For resumed sessions
      this field is the value from the resumed session state.


(E8)  improper line (un)folding and irregular indentation

In Section 7.4.7.1, on page 48, the clauses,

      client_version The latest (newest) version supported by the
         client.  This is used to detect version roll-back attacks.
         Upon receiving the premaster secret, the server SHOULD check
         that this value matches the value transmitted by the client in
         the client hello message.

      random
          46 securely-generated random bytes.

consistently should be formatted as:

|     client_version
|        The latest (newest) version supported by the client.  This is
         used to detect version roll-back attacks.  Upon receiving the
         premaster secret, the server SHOULD check that this value
         matches the value transmitted by the client in the client hello
         message.

      random
|        46 securely-generated random bytes.

and subsequently, the clause,

      pre_master_secret
          This random value is generated by the client and is used to
          generate the master secret, as specified in Section 8.1.

should be:

      pre_master_secret
|        This random value is generated by the client and is used to
|        generate the master secret, as specified in Section 8.1.


(E9)  spurious text line

During the removal of the "EXPORT" ciper suites from Appendix C,
a text line from RFC 2246 has been left there inadvertently.
The table, at the bottom of page 68,

(E10) improper language

During the addition of the third protocol variant, text in Appendix E
has become improper, stiil talking about "both" versions.

The second paragraph of Appendix E, on page 71,

   TLS versions 1.1 and 1.0, and SSL 3.0 are very similar; thus,
   supporting both is easy.  TLS clients who wish [...]
              ^^^^
should say, e.g.:

   TLS versions 1.1 and 1.0, and SSL 3.0 are very similar; thus,
|  supporting all is easy.  TLS clients who wish [...]
              ^^^


(E11) improper line (un)folding

Appendix E.1, near the bottom on page 73, contains the clause:

   challenge The client challenge to the server for the server to
      identify itself is a (nearly) arbitrary-length random.  The TLS
      server will right-justify the challenge data to become the
      ClientHello.random data (padded with leading zeroes, if
      necessary), as specified in this protocol specification.  If the
      length of the challenge is greater than 32 bytes, only the last 32
      bytes are used.  It is legitimate (but not necessary) for a V3
      server to reject a V2 ClientHello that has fewer than 16 bytes of
      challenge data.

This should be formatted as:

|  challenge
|     The client challenge to the server for the server to identify
      itself is a (nearly) arbitrary-length random.  The TLS server will
      right-justify the challenge data to become the ClientHello.random

I propose to post an Errata Note covering the above issues,
to the RFC Editor's RFC Errata web page.

I consider only issue (C1) substantive, because it corrects
the requirements language, and thus requires consensus;
all other issues seem to be straightforward.

Hello,

studying the recently published RFC 4347 authored/edited by you,
I found a couple of issues I'd like to report.

All excerpts from the RFC text are taken keeping their original
formatting, and modified text is formatted in conformance with
RFC guidelines again.

I use change bars ('|' in column 1) and casual up/down pointing
tags ('^^^' / 'vvv' marks in extra lines) to emphasize the location
of textual issues and/or proposed textual enhancements/corrections.


(1)  typo

At the top of page 3, Section 1 of RFC 4347 says:

                [...].  Unfortunately, although application layer
   security protocols generally provide superior security properties
   (e.g., end-to-end security in the case of S/MIME), they typically
   requires a large amount of effort to design -- in contrast to the
   relatively small amount of effort required to run the protocol over
   TLS.

It should say:

                [...].  Unfortunately, although application layer
   security protocols generally provide superior security properties
   (e.g., end-to-end security in the case of S/MIME), they typically
|  require a large amount of effort to design -- in contrast to the
   relatively small amount of effort required to run the protocol over
   TLS.


(2)  imprecise data description for `ciphersuites`

This is an issue inherited from RFC 4346 -- see my errata submission
on that RFC.  For convenience, I repeat the details here.

Section 7.4.1.2 of RFC 4346 (on p. 12 of RFC 4346) defines the syntax:

      uint8 CipherSuite[2];    /* Cryptographic suite selector */

According to the specifications given in Section 4.3 of RFC 4346,
vectors of type CipherSuite strictly must have byte lengths being a
multiple of 2.
This also means that the upper bound for a varaiable-length array
of type CipherSuite should always be a multiple of 2.

Hence, the declaration in Section 4.2.1 of RFC 4347, on page 12,

      struct {
        ProtocolVersion client_version;
        Random random;
        SessionID session_id;
        opaque cookie<0..32>;                             // New field
        CipherSuite cipher_suites<2..2^16-1>;
        CompressionMethod compression_methods<1..2^8-1>;
      } ClientHello;

should say:

      struct {
        ProtocolVersion client_version;
        Random random;
        SessionID session_id;
        opaque cookie<0..32>;                             // New field
|       CipherSuite cipher_suites<2..2^16-2>;
        CompressionMethod compression_methods<1..2^8-1>;
      } ClientHello;

This change should be applied to the syntax summary in section 4.3.2,
on mid-page 21, as well.


(3)  missing white space

In Section 4.2.2 of RFC 4347, the lines on top of page 14,

          case hello_verify_request: HelloVerifyRequest;  // New type
          case server_hello:  ServerHello;
          case certificate:Certificate;
          case server_key_exchange: ServerKeyExchange;
          case certificate_request: CertificateRequest;
          case server_hello_done:ServerHelloDone;
          case certificate_verify:  CertificateVerify;
          case client_key_exchange: ClientKeyExchange;
          case finished:Finished;

should say:

          case hello_verify_request: HelloVerifyRequest;  // New type
          case server_hello:         ServerHello;
|         case certificate:          Certificate;
          case server_key_exchange:  ServerKeyExchange;
          case certificate_request:  CertificateRequest;
|         case server_hello_done:    ServerHelloDone;
          case certificate_verify:   CertificateVerify;
          case client_key_exchange:  ClientKeyExchange;
|         case finished:             Finished;

This change should be applied to the syntax summary in section 4.3.2,
on top of page 21, as well.


(4)  copy-and-paste issue (?)

On page 20, the first declaration in Section 4.3.2,

      enum {
        hello_request(0), client_hello(1), server_hello(2),
        hello_verify_request(3),                          // New field
        certificate(11), server_key_exchange (12),
        certificate_request(13), server_hello_done(14),
        certificate_verify(15), client_key_exchange(16),
        finished(20), (255)
      } HandshakeType;

should say, using the appropriate term:

      enum {
        hello_request(0), client_hello(1), server_hello(2),
|       hello_verify_request(3),                          // New value
        certificate(11), server_key_exchange (12),
        certificate_request(13), server_hello_done(14),
        certificate_verify(15), client_key_exchange(16),
        finished(20), (255)
      } HandshakeType;


(5)  Outdated Informative References

RFC 4347 has been published several months after the new IPsec RFCs.
It therefore would have been preferrable to have the following
references updated:

   [AH]   :  RFC 2402  -->  RFC 4302

   [ESP]  :  RFC 2406  -->  RFC 4303

BTW: The Ref. "[AH]" does *not* appear anywhere in the text!

Also, The DCCP RFCs have been published a few weeks before RFC 4347;
therefore, the following Ref. update would have been appropriate:

   [DCCP] :  "Work in Progress"  -->  RFC 4340, March 2006.


(6)  unexpected / inappropriate Reference

Page 23 contains the inappropriate Informative Reference:

   [PHOTURIS] Karn, P. and W. Simpson, "ICMP Security Failures
              Messages", RFC 2521, March 1999.

This clearly should be:

|  [PHOTURIS] Karn, P. and W. Simpson, "Photuris: Session-Key Management
|             Protocol", RFC 2522, March 1999.

(Cf. the citations to [PHOTURIS], in Section 4.2.1, on page 11.)



I propose to post an Errata Note covering the above issues,
to the RFC Editor's RFC Errata web page.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,

studying the recently published RFC 4366 authored/edited by you,
I found a couple of issues I'd like to report.
(Some of these issues in fact are legacy issues from RFC 3546.)

All excerpts from the RFC text are taken literally, keeping their
original formatting, and modified text is formatted in conformance
with RFC guidelines again.

I use change bars ('|' in column 1) and casual up/down pointing
tags ('^^^' / 'vvv' marks in extra lines) to emphasize the location
of textual issues and/or proposed textual enhancements/corrections.


(1)  imprecise syntax description for `ciphersuites`

This is an issue inherited from RFC 2246, RFC 3546, and RFC 4346;
I already have reported this issue against RFC 4346 (and RFC 4347
as well).

Section 7.4.1.2 of RFC 4346, on page 37 of RFC 4346 defines the syntax:

      uint8 CipherSuite[2];    /* Cryptographic suite selector */

According to the specifications given in Section 4.3 of RFC 4346,
vectors of type CipherSuite strictly must have byte lengths being
a multiple of 2.
This also means that the upper bound for a varaiable-length array
of type CipherSuite should always be a multiple of 2.

Hence, the declaration in Section 2.1 of RFC 4366 (on page 5),
an extended version of the basic declaration in Section 7.4.1.2
of RFC 4346 (on top of page 38), stating

         struct {
             ProtocolVersion client_version;
             Random random;
             SessionID session_id;
             CipherSuite cipher_suites<2..2^16-1>;
             CompressionMethod compression_methods<1..2^8-1>;
             Extension client_hello_extension_list<0..2^16-1>;
         } ClientHello;

should better say:

         struct {
             ProtocolVersion client_version;
             Random random;
             SessionID session_id;
|            CipherSuite cipher_suites<2..2^16-2>;
             CompressionMethod compression_methods<1..2^8-1>;
             Extension client_hello_extension_list<0..2^16-1>;
         } ClientHello;


(2)  incomplete semantics specified for "server_name" extension

Section 3.1 of RFC 4366, on page 9, defines the "server_name"
extension as containing a *list* of `ServerName` structures.

On page 10, the same section says:

   It is RECOMMENDED that clients include an extension of type
   "server_name" in the client hello whenever they locate a server by a
   supported name type.

   A server that receives a client hello containing the "server_name"
   extension MAY use the information contained in the extension to guide
   its selection of an appropriate certificate to return to the client,
   and/or other aspects of security policy.  In this event, the server
   SHALL include an extension of type "server_name" in the (extended)
   server hello.  The "extension_data" field of this extension SHALL be
   empty.

   If the server understood the client hello extension but does not
|  recognize the server name, it SHOULD send an "unrecognized_name"
             ^^^
   alert (which MAY be fatal).

and on page 19, Section 4 defines the error alert,

   -  "unrecognized_name": this alert is sent by servers that receive a
|     server_name extension request, but do not recognize the server
      name.  This message MAY be fatal.                   ^^^

All these clauses apparently state the semantics for the "server_name"
extension solely in the case where the data field of the extension in
the (extended) Client Hello contains a *single* `ServerName` structure.

IMHO, if the client, as allowed by the syntax, indeed specifies
multiple names in the "server_name" extension -- a feature that
seems to be useful in certain scenarios --, it needs to get feedback
from the server as to which of the specified names has been used for
the purpose described in the second paragraph cited above.
Hence, the server should better be instructed by the specification
to include the selected name in the "server_name" extension returned
to the client in the (extended) Server Hello.
For backwards compatibility, the specification should perhaps
prescribe to omit this feedback, reverting to the specification
cited above) in the case that the Client Hello received contained
only a single server name.

In parallel, the semantics of the "unrecognized_name" alerts should
be amended to mean: all received names are unrecognized.


(3)  incomplete / outdated referencing text

The paragraph of Section 3.2 spanning from page 11 to page 12, says:

                               [...].  For example, if the negotiated
<page break>
   length is 2^9=512, then for currently defined cipher suites (those
   defined in [TLS], [KERB], and [AESSUITES]), and when null compression
   is used, the record layer output can be at most 793 bytes: 5 bytes of
   headers, 512 bytes of application data, 256 bytes of padding, and 20
   bytes of MAC.  [...]

This apparently is not up to date.  I propose to either substitute
"[TLSbis]," for "[TLS]," in the text above -- thus referring only to
current specifications --, or even to substitute "[TLS] and [TLSbis],"
for "[TLS]," there -- thus honoring to the predecessor.


(4)   spurious blank line

Within Section 3.6, the 5th paragraph on page 18 is interrupted
by a blank line in the middle of a sentence.
Perhaps this is a formatting artifact inherited from the page break
that was at this place in the text in RFC 3546.

Thus, the text body:

   Servers return a certificate response along with their certificate by
   sending a "CertificateStatus" message immediately after the
   "Certificate" message (and before any "ServerKeyExchange" or
   "CertificateRequest" messages).  If a server returns a
|
   "CertificateStatus" message, then the server MUST have included an
   extension of type "status_request" with empty "extension_data" in the
   extended server hello.

should be joined to say:

   Servers return a certificate response along with their certificate by
   sending a "CertificateStatus" message immediately after the
   "Certificate" message (and before any "ServerKeyExchange" or
   "CertificateRequest" messages).  If a server returns a
   "CertificateStatus" message, then the server MUST have included an
   extension of type "status_request" with empty "extension_data" in the
   extended server hello.


(5)  punctuation issue in Informative Reference

The following Informative Reference entry on page 28 contains
syntactically inconsistent punctuation:

   [MAILINGLIST]  J. Mikkelsen, R. Eberhard, and J. Kistler, "General
                  ClientHello extension mechanism and virtual hosting,"
                  ietf-tls mailing list posting, August 14, 2000.

should say:

   [MAILINGLIST]  J. Mikkelsen, R. Eberhard, and J. Kistler, "General
|                 ClientHello extension mechanism and virtual hosting",
                  ietf-tls mailing list posting, August 14, 2000.


Issue (2) above certainly needs discussion; perhaps you know what
once was intended.  The other issues seem to be straightforward.

After resolution, I propose to post an Errata Note covering the
above issues, to the RFC Editor's RFC Errata web page.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,

studying the recently published RFC 4444 authored/edited by you
I found a couple of issues I'd like to report.

(Admittedly, there is a remarkably small number of issues left in
RFC 4444, when compared with other RFCs of similar size.  Well done!)

All excerpts from the RFC text are taken literally, keeping their
original formatting, and modified text is formatted in conformance
with RFC guidelines again.

I use change bars ('|' in column 1) and casual up/down pointing
tags ('^^^' / 'vvv' marks in extra lines) to emphasize the location
of textual issues and/or proposed textual enhancements/corrections.

The subsequent items are listed mostly in RFC text order.
I omit mentioning all those apparently spurious blank lines perhaps
introduced in the publication process.


(1)  erratum: disfigured object name

In the DESCRIPTION clause of the isisCircLevelType OBJECT-TYPE macro
instance, on mid-page 32, the sentence

                                        [...].  Thus, if the
             isisSysTpe is level2 and the isisCircLevelType
             for a circuit is level1, the circuit will not send
             or receive IS-IS packets.  [...]

should say:
                    vvvvvvvvv
                                        [...].  Thus, if the
|            isisSysLevelType is level2 and the isisCircLevelType
             for a circuit is level1, the circuit will not send
             or receive IS-IS packets.  [...]


(2)  issue: non-use of appropriate TC (?)

The isisCircLevelIDOctet OBJECT-TYPE macro instance, on page 36,
contains the SYNTAX clause:

    isisCircLevelIDOctet OBJECT-TYPE
        SYNTAX Unsigned32(0..255)

After comparison with similar context in the RFC, I suspect that it
would be appropriate to use the IsisUnsigned8TC TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
in this place as well:

    isisCircLevelIDOctet OBJECT-TYPE
|       SYNTAX IsisUnsigned8TC


(3)  issue: unexpected indexing

As described in the SMIv2 RFCs, RFC 4444 extends various tables
by "reusing" of common index objects.  Surprisingly, there are
two deviations from this practice I cannot detect any reason for:

(3.1)
The isisSystemCounterTable (page 39 ff.) is indexed by the fresh,
independant index object, "isisSysStatLevel", while IMHO it would
have been logical to use the already defined index object of the
isisSysLevelTable (page 25 ff.), "isisSysLevelIndex", for this
purpose as well.

(3.2)
The isisPacketCounterTable (page 46 ff.) is indexed in the 2nd place
by the fresh, independant index object, "isisPacketCountLevel",
while IMHO it would have been logical to use the full index structure
of the isisCircLevelTable (page 34 ff.), including the index object,
"isisCircLevelIndex" in the second place, for this purpose as well.


(4)  issue: many unusual UNITS clauses

The UNITS clause is intended a to contains a textual definition of
the units associated with the object (according to RFC 2578, Section
7.2).  Network management systems usually provide for narrow label
space in their display screens - expecting usual [physical] unit
names like "bytes", "kilobytes", "seconds", "centiseconds", "Mbps",
"packets", "frames", "cells", "percent", etc.

For most packet counters, RFC 4444 specifies very unusual, lengthy
texts in the UNITS clauses that duplicate the text given in the
respective DESCRIPTION clauses.
This style should better have been avoided and might be noted as
an issue for any potential future update to RFC 4444.

For example, the isisPacketCountCSNP OBJECT-TYPE declaration, on
page 49 :

    isisPacketCountCSNP OBJECT-TYPE
        SYNTAX Counter32
|       UNITS "Number of IS-IS CSNP frames seen in this direction at
|            this level"
        MAX-ACCESS read-only
        STATUS current
        DESCRIPTION
            "The number of IS-IS CSNPs seen in this
             direction at this level."
        REFERENCE "{ISIS.aoi iSISControlPDUsSent (43)}"
    ::= { isisPacketCounterEntry 7 }

should perhaps better say:

    isisPacketCountCSNP OBJECT-TYPE
        SYNTAX Counter32
|       UNITS "frames"
        MAX-ACCESS read-only
        STATUS current
        DESCRIPTION
            "The number of IS-IS CSNPs seen in this
             direction at this level."
        REFERENCE "{ISIS.aoi iSISControlPDUsSent (43)}"
    ::= { isisPacketCounterEntry 7 }


(5)  errata(?): overly restrictive RowStatus object descriptions

Some tables with conceptual rows that can be dynamically added
or deleted, contain a control object with SYNTAX RowStatus
and other control objects, e.g. with SYNTAX IsisAdminState.

I expect that the latter objects have been intended to control
the activity of "live" table rows, without the need to deactivate
these rows via the RowStatus object before setting the AdminState
to "on" or "off", so much the more the support for the
'notInServcie' state of the RowStatus objects is explicitely
"not required".  Therefore, I strongly suspect that some RowStatus
object DESCRIPTION clauses have unintentionally been worded overly
restrictive and should been corrected to allow AdminStatus changes.

Some other such clauses contain statements that are void due to the
lack of accessible objects in those tables they could be applied to.

I have identified the following instances of these issues:

(5.1)

The DESCRIPTION clause of the isisManAreaAddrExistState OBJECT-TYPE
macro instance, on page 18, says:

        DESCRIPTION
            "The state of the isisManAreaAddrEntry.  If the
             isisSysAdminState for this Intermediate System is 'on' and
             an attempt is made to set this object to the value
             'destroy' or 'notInService' when this is the only
             isisManAreaAddrEntry in state 'active' for this
             Intermediate System should return inconsistentValue.
|
|            A row entry cannot be modified when the value of this
|            object is 'active'."

The last sentence is void, because the conceptual table rows of the
IsisManAreaAddrTable do not contain any other accessible objects
than the RowStatus object proper, isisManAreaAddrExistState.
Therefore, this clause should be shortened to say:

        DESCRIPTION
            "The state of the isisManAreaAddrEntry.  If the
             isisSysAdminState for this Intermediate System is 'on' and
             an attempt is made to set this object to the value
             'destroy' or 'notInService' when this is the only
             isisManAreaAddrEntry in state 'active' for this
             Intermediate System should return inconsistentValue."

(5.2)

The DESCRIPTION clause of the isisRedistributeAddrExistState
OBJECT-TYPE macro instance, on pp. 23/24, says:

        DESCRIPTION
            "The existence state of this summary address.  Support
<page break>
             for createAndWait and notInService is not required.
|
|            A row entry cannot be modified when the value of this
|            object is 'active'."

The last sentence is void, because the conceptual table rows of the
IsisRedistributeAddrTable do not contain any other accessible objects
than the RowStatus object proper, isisRedistributeAddrExistState.
Therefore, this clause should be shortened to say:

        DESCRIPTION
            "The existence state of this summary address.  Support
|            for 'createAndWait' and 'notInService' is not required."

(5.3)

The DESCRIPTION clause of the isisCircExistState OBJECT-TYPE macro
instance, on page 31, says:

        DESCRIPTION
            "The existence state of this circuit.  Setting the state
             to 'notInService' halts the generation and processing of
             IS-IS protocol PDUs on this circuit.  Setting the state
             to destroy will also erase any configuration associated
             with the circuit.  Support for 'createAndWait' and
             'notInService' is not required.

|            A row entry cannot be modified when the value of this
|            object is 'active'."

It should perhaps instead say:

        DESCRIPTION

             effective destination address from which embedded SNPA
             information is to be extracted.  [...]


(7)  erratum: disfigured object names

The last paragraph on page 62, within the DESCRIPTION clause of the
isisIPRAEntry OBJECT-TYPE declaration says:

             Implementers need to be aware that if the total number
             of elements (octets or sub-identifiers) in
             isisIPRADestr, isisIPRADestPrefixLen, and
             isisIPRANextHopIndex is too great, then OIDs of column
             instances in this table will have more than 128
             subidentifiers and cannot be accessed using SNMPv1,
<page break>
             [...]

It should perhaps say:

             Implementers need to be aware that if the total number
             of elements (octets or sub-identifiers) in
|            isisIPRADestType, isisIPRADest, isisIPRADestPrefixLen,

             subidentifiers and cannot be accessed using SNMPv1,
             [...]


(8)  issue: on-the-wire inefficiency in notifications

While admittedly the indexing structure of the MIB tables,
and the resulting lack of suitable accessible objects, apparently has
forced the introduction of the unusual and unusually large collection
of special objects with 'MAX-ACCESS accessible-for-notify'
(on pp. 71..74), some redundancies and inefficiencies in the
object groupings for notifications remain.  Repeatedly, the
number of objects could have been reduced by including properly
indexed objects into the notifications object groups instead of
separate "special" objects.  But this might have been considered
acceptable for the sake of a consistent object grouping style.

But there is one redundancy that could easily have been avoided.
The isisDatabaseOverload NOTIFICATION-TYPE declaration, on page 74,

    isisDatabaseOverload NOTIFICATION-TYPE
        OBJECTS {
            isisNotificationSysLevelIndex,
            isisSysLevelState
        }

includes the object, "isisSysLevelState", that already carries
the required SysLevelIndex in the index part of its OID, because
it is contained in the isisSysLevelTable.
Therefore, without any loss of information for the receiver of the
notification, this declaration could have been simplified to specify:

    isisDatabaseOverload NOTIFICATION-TYPE
        OBJECTS {
            isisSysLevelState
        }


This concludes my notes on RFC 4444.
Please comment.

Naturally, items (3) and (8) cannot be addressed any more
"after the fact" (i.e. publication of the RFC), and item (4)
should be addressed in a future update.

I propose to post to the RFC Editor's RFC Errata web page
an Errata Note covering the remaining issues.
I recommend that you submit an Author's Errata Note, making use
of the material presented above; but if you prefer, I can compile
a condensed version and submit it on my own, upon your approval.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
I'd like to mention a few errata and issues for the recently
published RFC 4483, editied by Eric Burger.
Because of the close relationship between the most annoying issue (see
item 3 below) and RFC 4485 (published just two weeks ahead of RFC 4483),
this message will be copied to the authors of RFC 4485, as well.


(1)  Inconsistent Ref. to URI Specification

The text of RFC 4483 repeatedly refers to  "RFC2396 [7]" .
This is misleading.
Every occurrence of "RFC 2396" should be replaced by "RFC 3986".

Note: Section 10.1. Normative References, holds the proper
      reference to STD 66, RFC 3986 in its item [7] !


(2)  Outdated Ref. to HTTP 1.1 Specification

Item [4] of Section 10.1 Normative References, points to the
outdated original specification for HTTP 1.1, RFC 2016,
which has been obsoleted by RFC 2616, 7 years ago.

Since the HTTP ETAG mechanism (referred to in the text of RFC 4483)
has been clarified substantially in RFC 2616, the reference to
"RFC2068 [4]" in Section 4, near the bottom of page 5 of RFC 4483,
should bhave been "RFC2616 [4]", and the item [4] of Section 10.1,
on page 15 of RFC 4483, should be replaced by a citation of RFC 2616
according to `rfc-ref.txt`.


(3)  (Mis)Use of SIP Terminology

Unfortunately, RFC 4483 substantially adds to the confusion
of precisely defined SIP (and other) terminology.

In particular, *all* occurrences of the term "Header[s]" in RFC 4483
should be corrected to say "Header Field[s]".

RFC 4485, published just 2 weeks ahead of RFC 4483, explicitely
poses the requirement for SIP extension documents to follow the
established SIP terminology -- cf. Section 4.3 of RFC 4485
(page 10), which says:

   Careful attention must be paid to the actual usage of terminology.
   Many documents misuse the terms header, header field, and header
   field values, for example.  Document authors SHOULD do a careful
   review of their documents for proper usage of these terms.

See also RFC 4249, Section 3.1.1 (page 3) for a similar statement on
the proper usage of these terms in the context of IMF and MIME, and
related (extension) specifications.


Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

i find this seeming erratum

3.2.3.1.  Type ASIdentifiers

   The ASIdentifiers type is a SEQUENCE containing one or more forms of
   autonomous system identifiers -- AS numbers (in the asnum element) or
   routing domain identifiers (in the rdi element).  When the
   ASIdentifiers type contains multiple forms of identifiers, the asnum
   entry MUST precede the rdi entry.  AS numbers are used by BGP, and
   routing domain identifiers are specified in the IDRP [RFC1142].


isn't 1142 is-is?

Hello,
I'd like to report the textual flaws I found reading the
recently published RFC 4521 == BCP 118 authored by you.

Most important issue:
Apparently, the update of the Reference tags within the text has
been performed incompletely after the assignment of RFC numbers
to those many LDAP I-Ds, leaving 'unsatisfied' tags in the text
(not listed in the References Sections), wherever these tags give
detailed citations, specifying a section or an Appendix there.

The errata detail items below are listed in textual order.
I use change bars and tag lines to emphasize the corrections
proposed and/or the issues in the original text.
Changed text is re-adjusted to conform to RFC formatting rules.


(1)  Section 2.5 (page 5) -- Ref. tags

The text,

   parsers/generators used in implementing the LDAP "core" technical
   specification [RFC4510], it is RECOMMENDED that extension elements
   (e.g., extension specific contents of controlValue, requestValue,
   responseValue fields) described by ASN.1 and encoded using BER be

(9)  Section 9.1 (page 13) -- duplicate entry

The entry at the bottom of page 13,

   [RFC4512]  Zeilenga, K., "Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
              (LDAP): Directory Information Models", RFC 4512, June
              2006.

should be deleted.
This entry is a duplicate, and it recurs on page 14, at the proper
place according to the collation order (by ascending RFC#).


I propose to post an RFC Errata Note using the material supplied
above to address these issues.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
I'd like to submit a few comments on the recently published
new LDAP RFCs authored by you: RFC 4515 and RFC 4516.


(1)

First of all, I appreciate the detailed discussion of the
document changes as presented in the appendices.

This exposition makes it much more easier for the reader
that did not (have the time to) follow the evolution of the
documents to quickly understand what's new and/or changed.
I wished many more RFC revisions would contain such information!


(2)

Section 2 of RFC 4515 apparently contains redundant legacy
information that might have been removed from the text.

The ASN.1 term, `AttributeValue`, has been replaced by
`AssertionValue` wherever it was used previously.
Hence, in Section 2 (on page 3) of RFC 4515

- the ASN.1 line

        AttributeValue ::= OCTET STRING

  is not needed any more and might have been omitted, and

- in the subsequent explanation, the sentence,

        [...]  The AttributeValue and AssertionValue OCTET STRING have
   the form defined in [RFC4517].  [...]

  might have been shortened to say:

        [...]  The AssertionValue OCTET STRING has the form defined ib
   [RFC4517].  [...]


(3)

The text in Section 4 of RFC 4515 (near the bottom of page 5)
contains an unexpected deviation from the "logical quoting" style
expected in RFCs and formally enforced by RFC Editor policy in
RFC authoring information.
The sentence,

   The first example shows use of the matching rule "caseExactMatch."

should say:

   The first example shows use of the matching rule "caseExactMatch".
                                                                   ^^

(4)

In RFC 4516, I found a small typo (word omission) in Appendix A.2,
in the 4th paragraph on page 12:

   Changed the text indicate that RFC 2255 is replaced ...

should perhaps say:

   Changed the text to indicate that RFC 2255 is replaced ...
                   ^^^^


Items (3) and (4) above might be considered Errata to be posted
to the RFC Editor's RFC Errata web pages.
But, perhaps, this is not worth the effort.

In any case, items (2)..(4) should be noted for future reference,
whenever once another revision of these RFCs is to be produced,
e.g., for advancement on the Standards Track.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
I would like to submit a few comments on the recently published
new LDAP protocol specification, RFC 4511, edited by you.


(1)  General

First of all, this is a very clearly structured specification
with constantly good technical and editorial quality.

In particular, I appreciate very much the detailed discussion
of the document changes as presented in Appendix C.
This exposition makes it much more easier for the reader
that did not (have the time to) follow the evolution of the
documents to quickly understand what's new and/or changed.
I wished many more RFC revisions would contain such information!


(2)  Typo

Section 2, on page 4, contains the paragraph:
                                        v
|  The term "SASL layer" refers to Simply Authentication and Security
   Layer (SASL) services used in providing security services, as well as
   associations established by these services.

It should say:
                                        v
|  The term "SASL layer" refers to Simple Authentication and Security
   Layer (SASL) services used in providing security services, as well as
   associations established by these services.


(3)  Misrepresented relationship between ISO 10646 and Unicode

Section 4.1.2 unfortunately has not corrected a misconception
initially spelled out in RFC 2251.

The first paragraph of Section 4.1.2, on page 7, says:

   The LDAPString is a notational convenience to indicate that, although
   strings of LDAPString type encode as ASN.1 OCTET STRING types, the
|  [ISO10646] character set (a superset of [Unicode]) is used, encoded
   following the UTF-8 [RFC3629] algorithm.  [...]

The (..) enclosed note on the relationship of ISO 10646 and Unicode
is *not* appropriate, as far as I know:

Unicode covers exactly the same character repertoire as ISO 10646,
but it *adds* a lot of *semantics* to ISO 10646.
The character repertoire synchronization between ISO 10646 and
Unicode is said to hold since 1993, and it is promised for all
future updates.
(Details can be found in Section 1.4 and Appendix C of
The Unicode Standard (book and online version), verbatim
identical in the Unicode 3.0 and Unicode 4.0 versions.)

In particular, this congruence holds for Unicode 3.2.0
(and the coordinated edition of ISO 10646) that has been
made the invariable base for the new LDAP specs.

Therefore, the above sentence should perhaps better be
corrected to say:

   The LDAPString is a notational convenience to indicate that, although
   strings of LDAPString type encode as ASN.1 OCTET STRING types, the
|  [ISO10646] character set (as detailed in [Unicode]) is used, encoded
   following the UTF-8 [RFC3629] algorithm.  [...]

(or similar).


(4)  Typo (word omission)

The 3rd paragraph of Section 4.2.2, on page 18, says:

   If the client receives a BindResponse where the resultCode is set to
   protocolError, it is to assume that the server does not support this
|  version of LDAP.  While the client may be able proceed with another
   version of this protocol (which may or may not require closing and
   re-establishing the transport connection), how to proceed with
   another version of this protocol is beyond the scope of this
   document.  Clients that are unable or unwilling to proceed SHOULD
   terminate the LDAP session.

It should say:
                                                 vvvv
|            [...].  While the client may be able to proceed with
   another version of this protocol (which may or may not require
   closing and re-establishing the transport connection), how to proceed
   with another version of this protocol is beyond the scope of this
   document.  [...]


Items (2)..(4) above might be considered for an Errata Note
to be posted to the RFC Editor's "RFC Errata" web pages.
I propose that you submit an Author's Errata Note, based on the
material presented above, and/or choosing alternate text for (3).

In any case, these items should be noted for future reference,
whenever once another revision of these RFCs is to be produced,
e.g., for advancement on the Standards Track.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
I'd like to submit a few comments on the recently published
RFC 4502 authored/edited by you.

Most items below (presented in RFC text order) are legacy
issues from the predecessor, RFC 2102.
(I apologize for never having found the time to submit
 a consolidated version of my side notes made to that RFC.)


(1)  clarification

The RFC 4502 text in Section 2.2, under bullet 3), on page 5,
says:

         Bit     Definition

         6       For WAN media, this bit is set for packets
                 coming from one direction and cleared for
                 packets coming from the other direction.
                 It is an implementation-specific matter
|                as to which bit is assigned to which
                 direction, but it must be consistent for
                 all packets received by the agent.  [...]

This text certainly is intended to always (and only) cover bit #6.
Therefore, the wording, "which bit is assigned" is misleading;
it should be "which [bit] value is assigned".

Thus, the above snippit sould better say:

         Bit     Definition

         6       For WAN media, this bit is set for packets
                 coming from one direction and cleared for
                 packets coming from the other direction.
                 It is an implementation-specific matter
|                as to which bit value is assigned to which
                 direction, but it must be consistent for
                 all packets received by the agent.  [...]


(2)  Ref. issue

In Section 3.2, the third paragraph on page 9 says:

   In the RMON MIB [RFC2819], the EntryStatus textual convention was
   introduced to provide this mutual exclusion function.  Since then,
   this function was added to the SNMP framework as the RowStatus
   textual convention.  The RowStatus textual convention is used for the
   definition of all new tables.

This text unfortunately has turned wrong by updating the (obsolete)
reference "[RFC1757]" (in RFC 2102) to "[RFC2819]".
(-- A very unusual event! --)
The text in RFC 2102 was correct, because RFC 1757 predates the
invention of the 'RowStatus' TC which was finalized in STD 58.
But STD 58 predates RFC 2819, and therefore, the clause,
     vvvvvvvvvv
|    Since then,
     this function was added to the SNMP framework
     as the RowStatus textual convention.
has turned wrong by the replacement of the Ref.!

(NOTE: RFC 2819 in fact still makes use of the 'EntryStatus' TC,
 which already had been introduced in RFC 1271, the predecessor
 of RFC 1757 !)

To correct this issue without causing a need to update the
References of RFC 4502 as well, I propose the following substitute
text as an Erratum for the text snippit above:

          vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
|  In the predecessors of the RMON MIB [RFC2819], the EntryStatus
   textual convention was introduced to provide this mutual exclusion
   function.  Since then, this function was added to the SNMP framework
   as the RowStatus textual convention.  The RowStatus textual
   convention is used for the definition of all new tables.


(3)  outdated Ref.

The DESCRIPTION clause of the protocolDirID OBJECT-TYPE,
on page 21/22 of RFC 4502, says:

    DESCRIPTION
        "A unique identifier for a particular protocol.  Standard
        identifiers will be defined in such a manner that they
<< page break >>
        can often be used as specifications for new protocols - i.e.,
        a tree-structured assignment mechanism that matches the
        protocol encapsulation 'tree' and that has algorithmic
        assignment mechanisms for certain subtrees.  See RFC 2074 for
        more details.

        [...]

RFC 2074 has been obsoleted by RFC 2895 and RFC 2896.
Therefore, the last sentence of this paragraph should better say:

                                             [...].  See RFC 2895 and
        RFC 2896 for more details.


(4)  MIB indexing issue #1

As stated in the text added by RFC 4502 to the DESCRIPTION clause
of the addressMapEntry OBJECT-TYPE, the addressMapTable might run
in problems due to the cumulative length of its index object
instances.

Therefore, I suspect that it might have been better to replace the
last index object, addressMapSource, by an object mirroring the
addressMapControlIndex object (direct use of addressMapControlIndex
as the *last* index object might not be considered a valid option).

NOTE:
I know that it it too late now for any change, unfortunately.


(5)  MIB indexing issue #2

The DESCRIPTION clause of the TimeFilter TEXTUAL-CONVENTION,
on page 16, explains that an index object of type TimeFilter
should be included as the *first* INDEX component for a time-
filtered table:

      A time-filtered conceptual table is created by inserting a
      single object of SYNTAX TimeFilter as the first INDEX component
      in a copy of an existing basic conceptual table (i.e., any
      SEQUENCE without a TimeFilter INDEX component).  [...]

The RMON2 MIB does not follow this rule for the following tables:
  - nlHostTable,
  - nlMatrixSDTable,
  - nlMatrixDSTable,
  - alHostTable,
  - alMatrixSDTable, and
  - alMatrixDSTable.

Since there are arguably good reasons for the present indexing
structure of these tables, it might perhaps have been better
to have the above DESCRIPTION of the TC modified to accommodate
for the existing practice.


(6)  textual issue

The first paragraph of the DESCRIPTION clause for the
alMatrixTopNControlRateBase OBJECT-TYPE, on page 78, says:

        "This object controls which alMatrix[SD/DS] entry that the
        alMatrixTopNEntries are sorted by, which view of the matrix
        table that will be used, as well as which table the results
        will be reported in.

It should perhaps better say (deleting 2 x 'that'):

|       "This object controls which alMatrix[SD/DS] entry the
        alMatrixTopNEntries are sorted by, which view of the matrix
|       table will be used, as well as which table the results
        will be reported in.


(7)  wrong numerical limits in ASN.1 comment

The ASN.1 comments on the User History Collection Group,
in the second paragraph on page 86, says:

-- A sample value is stored in two objects - an absolute value and
-- a status object.  This allows numbers from -(2G-1) to +4G to be
-- stored.  The status object also indicates whether a sample is
-- valid.  This allows data collection to continue if periodic
-- retrieval of a particular instance fails for any reason.

Based on the specification of usrHistoryAbsValue and
usrHistoryValStatus (on page93/94), I strongly suspect that the
specified limits are wrong, and that this text should say:

-- A sample value is stored in two objects - an absolute value and
-- a status object.  This allows numbers from -(4G-1) to +(4G-1) to
-- be stored.  The status object also indicates whether a sample is
-- valid.  This allows data collection to continue if periodic
-- retrieval of a particular instance fails for any reason.


(8)  inappropriate semantics specified in DESCRIPTION text
     for objects in the usrHistoryControlTable

The DESCRIPTION clause of the usrHistoryControlBucketsRequested and
usrHistoryControlBucketsGranted objects (on page 87/88) seem to be
garbled a bit.

The latter contains the (3rd) paragraph:

        The associated usrHistoryControlBucketsRequested object
        should be set before or at the same time as this object
        to allow the probe to accurately estimate the resources
        required for this usrHistoryControlEntry.

This makes no sense here, because the usrHistoryControlBucketsGranted
object is read-only, and hence cannot be set.

I strongly suspect that a similar coupling in fact is needed
for the usrHistoryControlObjects object in relation to the
usrHistoryControlBucketsRequested object:
The probe cannot estimate the internal resource requirements,
and hence determine the value of usrHistoryControlBucketsGranted
without knowing the values of both the usrHistoryControlObjects
and the usrHistoryControlBucketsRequested objects in a row.

Therefore, I suspect that the above paragraph should be deleted,
and re-inserted with a slight modification as the new second
paragraph into the usrHistoryControlBucketsRequested DESCRIPTION
clause, saying:
                                        vvvvvvv
|       The associated usrHistoryControlObjects object
        should be set before or at the same time as this object
        to allow the probe to accurately estimate the resources
        required for this usrHistoryControlEntry.

(I intentionally have omitted the appropriate line re-folding
 here for clarity.)


(9)  two typos

The DESCRIPTION clause of the ControlString TEXTUAL-CONVENTION,
on page 95, contains two typos:

The paragraph:

           ^w  Wait for the reply string that follows, which is
               terminated by the next command or the end of string.
               Partial and case-insensitive matching is applied, i.e.,
               if the reply string (any case combination) is found
               anywhere in the received string, then the a match is
               found.  If the current timeout elapses without a match,
               then the remaining control string is ignored.

should say (deleting 'the' in 'the a') :

           ^w  Wait for the reply string that follows, which is
               terminated by the next command or the end of string.
               Partial and case-insensitive matching is applied, i.e.,
               if the reply string (any case combination) is found
|              anywhere in the received string, then a match is found.
               If the current timeout elapses without a match, then
               the remaining control string is ignored.

The 4th-to-last line of page 95,

           ^    0x1C

should say:

           ^\    0x1C


(10)  textual clarification

In the Appendix of RFC 4502 (Section 8), the paragraph below
the pseudo-code on page 133 says:

   The agent applies this function regardless of the lastActivationTime
   of the conceptual row in question.  In other words, counter
   discontinuities are ignored (i.e., a conceptual row is deleted and
   then re-created later).  An agent should consider an object instance
   'changed' when it is created (either at restart time for scalars and
   static objects, or row-creation-time for dynamic tables).

It should better say:

   The agent applies this function regardless of the lastActivationTime
   of the conceptual row in question.  In other words, counter
|  discontinuities (e.g., a conceptual row is deleted and then re-
|  created later) are ignored.  An agent should consider an object
   instance 'changed' when it is created (either at restart time for
   scalars and static objects, or row-creation-time for dynamic tables).


I propose to submit an RFC Errata note for RFC 4502, covering
items (1)..(3) and (6)..(10) above, for publication on the RFC
Editor's RFC Errata web pages.  Please verify.

Perhaps it would be best if you could prepare an Author's Errata Note
making use of the material presented above, but if you prefer, I can
prepare an Errata Note on my own and submit directly it (after your
approval).

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
after studying the recently published RFCs 4544 and 4545
authored by you, I would like to submit a few notes on
issues I found in these memos.

This note is on RFC 4545.
Another message will be prepared soon, covering RFC 4544.

I make use of change bars ('|' in column 1) to emphasize the
location of textual issues and/or proposed textual changes.
Modified text is re-adjusted according to RFC formatting rules.

The items below are listed (and enumerated) in RFC text sequence.
Item (5) apparently is a serious issue.
All other items are simple errata.


(1)  typo in Abstract

The Abstract, on page 1 of RFC 4545, contains the sentence:

   [...]
   In particular, it defines objects for managing user identities and
|  the names, addresses, and credentials required manage access control,
   for use with various protocols.  [...]

The text should say (filling in the missing 'to'):

   In particular, it defines objects for managing user identities and
|  the names, addresses, and credentials required to manage access
   control, for use with various protocols.  [...]


(2)  typo in Section 5

The first paragraph of Section 5, on page 4 of RFC 4545, says:

   The User-based Security Model (USM) [RFC3414] also defines the
   concept of a user, defining authentication and privacy protocols and
   their credentials.  The definition of USM includes the SNMP-USER-
|  BASED-SM-MIB module allows configuration of SNMPv3 user credentials
   to protect SNMPv3 messages.  [...]

The text should say (filling in the missing 'that'):

   The User-based Security Model (USM) [RFC3414] also defines the
   concept of a user, defining authentication and privacy protocols and
   their credentials.  The definition of USM includes the SNMP-USER-
|  BASED-SM-MIB module that allows configuration of SNMPv3 user
   credentials to protect SNMPv3 messages.  [...]


(3)  clarification in Section 7

The first paragraph of Section 7, on page 5 of RFC 4545, says:

|  This MIB module structure is intended to allow the configuration of a
   list of user identities, each with a list of names, addresses,
|  credentials, and certificates that, when combined, will distinguish
   that identity.

The wording should be enhanced, and the reference to certificates
should be removed -- these apparently have been excluded from the
MIB in the published version.

Therefore, the text should perhaps better say:

|  This MIB module's structure is intended to allow the configuration of
   a list of user identities, each with a list of names, addresses, and
|  credentials that, when combined, will distinguish that identity.


(4)  improper DESCRIPTION text

The DESCRIPTION clause for the ipsAuthIdentAddrAttributesTable
OBJECT-TYPE, on page 19, says:

       DESCRIPTION
           "A list of address ranges that are allowed to serve
           as the endpoint addresses of a particular identity.
           An address range includes a starting and ending address
|          and an optional netmask, and an address type indicator,
           which can specify whether the address is IPv4, IPv6,
           FC-WWPN, or FC-WWNN."

This text improperly mentions the use of netmasks, which has been
explicitely excluded from the MIB module, as can be seen from the
subsequent IpsAuthIdentAddrAttributesEntry syntax, and as explained
in the last paragraph of Section 7.5, on page 8 of the RFC.

Therefore, this clause should say:

       DESCRIPTION
           "A list of address ranges that are allowed to serve
           as the endpoint addresses of a particular identity.
           An address range includes a starting and ending address,
|          and an address type indicator, which can specify whether
           the address is IPv4, IPv6, FC-WWPN, or FC-WWNN."


(5)  redundant MIB objects -- serious danger of inconsistency

Conceptually, rows of the ipsAuthCredChap, ipsAuthCredSrp, and
ipsAuthCredKerberos tables are a variant record (union in "C")
contained in the corresponding rows of the ipsAuthCredential table.
The DESCRIPTION clauses make clear, that the 'life' of the former
table rows is directly coupled to the 'life' of the latter rows --
for example, the DESCRIPTION clause of the ipsAuthCredAuthMethod
OBJECT-TYPE says:

           When a row is created in this table, a corresponding
           row must be created by the management station
           in a corresponding table specified by this value.

           When a row is deleted from this table, the corresponding
           row must be automatically deleted by the agent in
           the corresponding table specified by this value.

IMHO, it is inconsistent to have the agent delete the row, but
let the management station create the row; the SETting of an
ipsAuthCredAuthMethod object should create the corresponding row.
According to this explanantion and the identical indexing structure
of the four tables, the agent thus is directed to maintain exactly
one of those variant rows, matching the current value of a given
ipsAuthCredAuthMethod instance.

In the published version of the IPS-AUTH-MIB module, the rows
of the basic ipsAuthCredentialAttributesTable contains objects of
RowStatus and StorageType syntax that are used to create/activate/
delete an ipsAuthCredentialAttributesEntry conceptual row, and to
specify the persistence behaviour of that row, respectively.

Therefore, IMHO it makes no sense, and it entails the danger of
fundamental semantic inconsistencies in the MIB module, to also
maintain objects of RowStatus and StorageType syntax in the
variant table rows.
E.g.,
- no `active` row can exist in the ipsAuthCredChapAttributesTable
  without a corresponding `active` row in the
  ipsAuthCredentialAttributesTable;
- no ipsAuthCredChapAttributesEntry can be created by the manager,
  that MUST be done automatically by the agent when the
  ipsAuthCredAuthMethod instance is set to ipsAuthMethodChap;
- the ipsAuthCredentialAttributesEntry should be set inactive,
  if desired, and not the ipsAuthCredChapAttributesEntry;
- the StorageType of both entries MUST be exactly the same.

Therefore, IMHO the objects
  o   ipsAuthCredChapRowStatus,
  o   ipsAuthCredChapStorageType,
  o   ipsAuthCredSrpRowStatus,
  o   ipsAuthCredSrpStorageType,
  o   ipsAuthCredKerbRowStatus,  and
  o   ipsAuthCredKerbStorageType
should be deprecated as soon as possible, and its MAX-ACCESS
changed to read-only, with explanation added to the DESCRIPTION
clauses that the values of these objects (if implemented), are
agent maintained mirrors of the corresponding ipsAuthCredRowStatus
and ipsAuthCredStorageType objects, respectively.

Additionally, it should be specified that a ipsAuthCredRowStatus
instance must not be set to `active` unless the proper credentials
have been set in the appropriate ipsAuthCred* "detail" row.

If it is decided that automatic row creation by the agent should
not be specified for backwards compatibility, at least the
ipsAuthCred*StorageType objects should be deprecated.


(6)  clarification in compliance statement

The DESCRIPTION clause of the ipsAuthComplianceV1 MODULE-COMPLIANCE
says:

       DESCRIPTION
           "Initial version of compliance statement based on
           initial version of this MIB module.

           The Instance and Identity groups are mandatory;
           at least one of the other groups (Name, Address,
|          Credential, Certificate) is also mandatory for
           any given implementation."

Similar to item (3) above, the reference to 'Certificate' is
inappropriate and should be deleted; additionally, the plural
form of 'Credential' should be used.

Thus, this clause should say:

       DESCRIPTION
           "Initial version of compliance statement based on
           initial version of this MIB module.

           The Instance and Identity groups are mandatory;
           at least one of the other groups (Name, Address,
|          Credentials) is also mandatory for any given
           implementation."


(7)  incomplete citations

The following References are incomplete according to RFC-Ed policy;
they should be amended by  "STD 62, "  just before the RFC number.

In Section 11, on page 40, the entry:

   [RFC3411]  Harrington, D., Presuhn, R., and B. Wijnen, "An
              Architecture for Describing Simple Network Management
              Protocol (SNMP) Management Frameworks", RFC 3411, December
              2002.

should say:

   [RFC3411]  Harrington, D., Presuhn, R., and B. Wijnen, "An
              Architecture for Describing Simple Network Management
              Protocol (SNMP) Management Frameworks", STD 62, RFC 3411,
              December 2002.

In Section 12, on page 41, the entry:

   [RFC3414]  Blumenthal, U. and B. Wijnen, "User-based Security Model
              (USM) for version 3 of the Simple Network Management
              Protocol (SNMPv3)", RFC 3414, December 2002.

should say:

   [RFC3414]  Blumenthal, U. and B. Wijnen, "User-based Security Model
              (USM) for version 3 of the Simple Network Management
              Protocol (SNMPv3)", STD 62, RFC 3414, December 2002.


All items sould be covered by an RFC Errata Note posted to
the RFC Editor's RFC Errata web pages.
Item (5) apparently needs discussion and should be addressed soon.
The other items should be self-evident.

Preferrably, you should submit an Author's Errata Note, making
freely use of the material presented above.  But if you prefer,
I can also formally submit an Errata Note, with your approval.

Perhaps, a modified version of the MIB module should be published in
the "in-notes/mibs/current.mibs" subdirectory of the RFC repository
(cf. the procedure followed by RFC 3273 for the RMON MIBs).

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
after studying the recently published RFC 4544 (iSCSI MIB)
authored by you, I would like to submit a few comments
pointing to issues and errata in the RFC text.


(1)  outdated text

Within Section 6, the first paragraph on top of page 5 says:

   It is worthwhile to note that this is an iSCSI MIB module and as such
   reflects only iSCSI objects.  This module does not contain
   information about the SCSI-layer attributes of a device.  If a SCSI
|  layer is present, the SCSI MIB module, currently under development,
   may be used to manage SCSI information for a device.

The last apparently sentence is outdated.  There already is an
appropriate Informative Reference given on page 81 of the RFC.
The RFC should say:

   It is worthwhile to note that this is an iSCSI MIB module and as such
   reflects only iSCSI objects.  This module does not contain
   information about the SCSI-layer attributes of a device.  If a SCSI
|  layer is present, the SCSI MIB module [RFC4455] may be used to manage
   SCSI information for a device.
                                        ^^^^^^^^^^^


(2)  lack of distinguishing DESCRIPTION text

The iscsiDescriptors OBJECT-IDENTITY declarations, on page 16/17
of the RFC, unfortunately contain pairwise identical DESCRIPTION
clauses, making Header and Data Integrity identifiers
indistinguishable.
This obviously needs short-term correction, e.g.:


The DESCRIPTION clause of the iscsiHdrIntegrityNone OBJECT-IDENTITY,

    DESCRIPTION
        "The authoritative identifier when no integrity
|       scheme (for either the header or data) is being
<<page break>>
        used."

should better say:

    DESCRIPTION
        "The authoritative identifier when no integrity
|       scheme for the header is being used."

The DESCRIPTION clause of the iscsiHdrIntegrityCrc32c OBJECT-IDENTITY,

    DESCRIPTION
        "The authoritative identifier when the integrity
|       scheme (for either the header or data) is CRC32c."

should better say:

    DESCRIPTION
        "The authoritative identifier when the integrity
|       scheme for the header is CRC32c."

The DESCRIPTION clause of the iscsiDataIntegrityNone OBJECT-IDENTITY,

    DESCRIPTION
        "The authoritative identifier when no integrity
|       scheme (for either the header or data) is being
        used."

should better say:

    DESCRIPTION
        "The authoritative identifier when no integrity
|       scheme for the data is being used."

The DESCRIPTION clause of the iscsiDataIntegrityCrc32c OBJECT-IDENTITY,

    DESCRIPTION
        "The authoritative identifier when the integrity
|       scheme (for either the header or data) is CRC32c."

should better say:

    DESCRIPTION
        "The authoritative identifier when the integrity
|       scheme for the data is CRC32c."


(3)  4 similar typos

The DESCRIPTION clause of the iscsiInstSsnFailures  OBJECT-TYPE,
on page 20 of RFC 4544, says:

    DESCRIPTION
        "This object counts the number of times a session belonging
|       to this instance has been failed.  If this counter has
        suffered a discontinuity, the time of the last discontinuity
        is indicated in iscsiInstDiscontinuityTime."

It should better say:

    DESCRIPTION
        "This object counts the number of times a session belonging
|       to this instance has failed.  If this counter has suffered a
        discontinuity, the time of the last discontinuity is indicated
        in iscsiInstDiscontinuityTime."

The DESCRIPTION clause of the iscsiInstSsnDigestErrors OBJECT-TYPE,
on page 22 of RFC 4544, says:

    DESCRIPTION
|       "The count of sessions that were failed due to receipt of
        a PDU containing header or data digest errors.  If this
        counter has suffered a discontinuity, the time of the last
        discontinuity is indicated in iscsiInstDiscontinuityTime."

It should better say:

    DESCRIPTION
|       "The count of sessions that failed due to receipt of
        a PDU containing header or data digest errors.  If this
        counter has suffered a discontinuity, the time of the last
        discontinuity is indicated in iscsiInstDiscontinuityTime."

The DESCRIPTION clause of the iscsiInstSsnCxnTimeoutErrors OBJECT-TYPE,
on page 22 of RFC 4544, says:

    DESCRIPTION
|       "The count of sessions that were failed due to a sequence
        exceeding a time limit.  If this counter has suffered a
        discontinuity, the time of the last discontinuity
        is indicated in iscsiInstDiscontinuityTime."

It should better say:

    DESCRIPTION
|       "The count of sessions that failed due to a sequence
        exceeding a time limit.  If this counter has suffered a
        discontinuity, the time of the last discontinuity
        is indicated in iscsiInstDiscontinuityTime."

The DESCRIPTION clause of the iscsiInstSsnFormatErrors OBJECT-TYPE,
on page 23 of RFC 4544, says:

    DESCRIPTION
|       "The count of sessions that were failed due to receipt of
        a PDU that contained a format error.  If this counter has
        suffered a discontinuity, the time of the last discontinuity
        is indicated in iscsiInstDiscontinuityTime."

It should better say:

    DESCRIPTION
|       "The count of sessions that failed due to receipt of
        a PDU that contained a format error.  If this counter has
        suffered a discontinuity, the time of the last discontinuity
        is indicated in iscsiInstDiscontinuityTime."


(4)  incomplete descriptions

Within the Target Attributes Table, the objects
    iscsiTgtLastFailureType,
    iscsiTgtLastIntrFailureName,
    iscsiTgtLastIntrFailureAddrType, and
    iscsiTgtLastIntrFailureAddr
apparently have no meaningful value if no error has occurred (yet).
The DESCRIPTION clauses for these objects, on page 38/39 of RFC 4544,
do not indicate the behaviour of these objects in this case, i.e.,
when the iscsiTgtLastFailureTime instance in a given conceptual
row has the value zero.
The respective DESCRIPTION clauses should indicate whether these
objects
  -   should not be instantiated
or
  -   have a certain default value (t.b.d.)
in this case.


A similar issue holds for the objects in the Initiator Attributes
Table,
    iscsiIntrLastFailureType,
    iscsiIntrLastTgtFailureName,
    iscsiIntrLastTgtFailureAddrType, and
    iscsiIntrLastTgtFailureAddr
(The corresponding DESCRIPTIONS can be found on page 46/47.)


(5)  row creation / storageType restriction

Various tables contain rows that can be created/deleted dynamically.
Repeatedly, for these tables the DESCRIPTION clauses for the
corresponding StorageType objects contain the sentence
(e.g., for iscsiTgtAuthStorageType, on page 44):

                                  [...].  Rows in this table that were
         created through an external process may have a storage type of
         readOnly or permanent.

It is not clear from the text what precisely 'external process'
means, and therefore it remains open whether/why the restriction
on values `readOnly` or `permanent` makes sense.


(6)  unpleasant alignment

Any future update to this RFC should correct the unpleasant
staggered tabular alignment of the following row-structure
( SEQUENCE { ... } ) declarations for:
  o  IscsiPortalAttributesEntry,
  o  IscsiInitiatorAttributesEntry, and
  o  IscsiInitiatorLoginStatsEntry


(7)  Semantic gap in Initiator Login Stats Table ??

The Initiator Login Stats Table somehow is a "dual" of the
Target Login Stats Table.
Therefore, I miss an object in the Initiator Login Stats Table
corresponding to iscsiTgtLoginAuthorizeFails, counting received
Login Response PDUs with status class 0x202.


(8)  typo?

The DESCRIPTION clause of the iscsiSsnAuthIdentity OBJECT-TYPE,
on page 58 of the RFC, says:

    DESCRIPTION
        "This object contains a pointer to a row in the
        IPS-AUTH MIB module that identifies the authentication
|       method being used on this session, as communicated
        during the login phase."

I strongly suspect that it should say instead:

    DESCRIPTION
        "This object contains a pointer to a row in the
        IPS-AUTH MIB module that identifies the authentication
|       identity being used on this session, as communicated
        during the login phase."


(9)  common problem with indiscontinuity tagging

The Session Stats Table defines and admits High-Capacity (64-bit)
and Low-Capacity (32-bit) octet counters.
If both types of counters are implemented, according to the
DESCRIPTION clauses of all these counters,

        [...]
        If this counter has suffered a discontinuity, the time of the
        last discontinuity is indicated in iscsiSsnDiscontinuityTime."

Hence, iscsiSsnDiscontinuityTime must indicate discontinuities
in the HC and the LC counters, i.e. it must be changed whenever
one of the LC counters wraps back to zero, making it almost
useless for efficient surveillance of discontinuities in all
the other counters covered by this object.
Perhaps, as it has been done in a few other IETF MIBs in the past,
inclusion of additional 32-bit counters yielding the high part
(most significant 32 bits) of the HC counters for use with SNMPv1
management stations would have allowed to change the semantics of
iscsiSsnDiscontinuityTime to avoid too frequent changes.


Please comment.
I propose to address items (1)..(3) and (8) above with
an RFC Errata Note, where (1), (3), and (8) apparently are
straightforward, while (2) - directly affecting interoperability -
perhaps needs your consent.
The other items at least should be noted for future consideration.

Best regards
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
after reading the recently published RFC 4430 authored by you
I would like to submit a few notes on textual issues I found
in that memo.

The items below are presented in textual order, after a 'preface'
giving the rationale for most of the corrections suggested.

I use change bars ('|' in column 1) and (occasionally) up/down
pointing marker lines to emphasize the location of textual issues
in the snippits from the RFC text and/or the proposed modified text.
Modified text has been adjusted according to RFC formatting policy.


(0)  Rationale for most non-trivial issues listed below:
==============

The most remarkable inconsistencies I have found are in Section 4.2.
The initial text of that section (on page 16) says:

   Immediately following the header, there is a list of
   Type/Length/Value (TLV) payloads.  There can be any number of
   payloads following the header.  Each payload MUST begin with a
   payload header.  Each payload header is built on the generic payload
   header.  Any data immediately follows the generic header.  Payloads
   are all implicitly aligned to 4-octet boundaries, though the payload
   length field MUST accurately reflect the actual number of octets in
   the payload.

     0                   1                   2                   3
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
    +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
    | Next Payload  |   RESERVED    |         Payload Length        |
    +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
    |                      value (variable)                         |
    +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+

                    Figure 6:  Format of a KINK Payload

   Fields:

     [...]


To sum up: a KINK payload consists of a (generic) payload header
and the (payload) value field.

Unfortunately, the subsequent sub-sections 4.2.* inadvertently
seem to pretend that there exists another copy of the payload
header within the payload value, which certainly was not intended.

Most of the corrections given below are needed to correct this
misconception, leaving the breakdown and all details of the payload
header in Section 4.2, while deleting all these (repeated) details
from the sections 4.2.*.



(1)  Section 4.2.1 (page 17)

(1a)  typo (word omission)

The final sentence in the 3rd paragraph of Section 4.2.1 says:

                                                            [...].  A
   principal name is case sensitive, and "fqdn" part MUST be lowercase
   as described in [KERBEROS].

It should say:
                                        vvvvv
                                                            [...].  A
|  principal name is case sensitive, and the "fqdn" part MUST be
   lowercase as described in [KERBEROS].

The subsequent text, Figure 7, and the explanations,

(I.e. the payload header -- not being part of the value field --,
 must be deleted from Figure 7, and the redundant explanation of the
 payload header fields must be removed from the list of explanations
 of the sub-fields of the payload value field.)

(7)  Section 4.2.7 (page 22/23)

Item (1b) above applies, and plaintext vs. ciphertext is unclear.

The initial text and Figure 13 unfortunately do not properly make
the distinction between unencrypted (plaintext) and encrypted
(ciphertext) values and fields.
The presentation on page 22 needs clarification, according to the
note given on page 23:

   The coverage of the encrypted data begins at InnerNextPload so that
   the first payload's type is kept confidential.  Thus, the number of
   encrypted octets is PayloadLength - 4.

On page 22, the text and Figure 13,

|  The KINK_ENCRYPT payload encapsulates other KINK payloads and is
|  encrypted using the session key and the algorithm specified by its
   etype.  This payload MUST be the final one in the outer payload chain
|  of the message.  The KINK_ENCRYPT payload MUST be encrypted before
   the final KINK checksum is applied.

     0                   1                   2                   3

On page 23, the first bullet,

|         beginning of this section.  This payload is the last one in a
|         message, and accordingly, the Next Payload field must be

should be deleted.
(Part of the text is incorporated above; see (1b) for the remainder.)

(7b)  typo, and (7a) continued

The final paragraph of Section 4.2.7, on page 23, says:

                            vvv
|  The format of the encryption payload follows the normal Kerberos
   semantics.  Its content is the output of an encrypt function defined
   in the Encryption Algorithm Profile section of [KCRYPTO].  Parameters
   such as encrypt function itself, specific-key, and initial state are
   defined with the etype.  The encrypt function may have padding in
   itself and there may be some garbage data at the end of the decrypted
   plaintext.  A KINK implementation MUST be prepared to ignore such
   padding after the last sub-payload inside the KINK_ENCRYPT payload.
   [...]

It should say:

                            vv        vvvvvv
|  The format of the encrypted payload value follows the normal Kerberos
   semantics.  Its content is the output of an encrypt function defined
   in the Encryption Algorithm Profile section of [KCRYPTO].  Parameters
|  such as the encrypt function itself, specific-key, and initial state
   are defined with the etype.  The encrypt function may have padding in
   itself and there may be some garbage data at the end of the decrypted
   plaintext.  A KINK implementation MUST be prepared to ignore such
   padding after the last sub-payload inside the KINK_ENCRYPT payload.
   [...]


(8)  Section 4.2.8

As this section is self-consistent with respect to the terminology
posed in the RFC, I omit recommending a change similar to item (2)
etc. above, but that should be considered for any update to this RFC
in the future, to make the subsections 4.2.* as similar as possible.

The text of this section twice, and redundantly, specifies
on page 23 :

                          [...].  The error code is in network order.

and on page 24 :

     o    ErrorCode -- One of the following values in the network byte
          order:
          [...]

This looks like a big exeption.  But in fact, that is the general
rule as set in the first sentence of Section 4, on page 13!
At best, the former sentence should be deleted, and the latter
bullet changed to say:

     o    ErrorCode -- One of the following values:
          [...]

If it is preferred to not delete the former sentence and the latter
clause, at least the "the" in "in the network byte order" should be
deleted.


(9)  further word omissions in running text

(9a) The first paragraph of Section 6.6, on page 32, says:

   A GETTGT command is only used to carry a Kerberos TGT and is not
   related to SA management; therefore, it contains only KINK_TGT_REQ
   payload and does not contain any DOI-specific payload.

It should say:

   A GETTGT command is only used to carry a Kerberos TGT and is not
|  related to SA management; therefore, it contains only a KINK_TGT_REQ
   payload and does not contain any DOI-specific payload.

(9b) The first paragraph of Section 7, on page 32, says:

   KINK uses the same key derivation mechanisms defined in section 5.5
   of [IKE], which is:

It should say:

|  KINK uses the same key derivation mechanisms as defined in section
   5.5 of [IKE], which is:


Please comment.
To address these issues, I recommend that you submit an Author's
Errata Note to the RFC-Ed's RFC Errata web pages, making freely
use of the material presented above.
But if you prefer, I can also submit a formal Errata Note

This is common practice when writing RFC's, and is intended to show  
the complete payload WITH THE HEADER. This does not mean that there  
is a duplicate header there, but instead the header is shown for  
completeness.

Thus, if the full payloads have been presented intentionally
(including the repeated specification of the payload header),   (*)
why does the RFC text constantly say it is talking about the
payload *values* ???

I will immediately prepare a revised version of my original
mail that will try to change that instead, to get rid of the
inconsistencies in the text, in a manner that accomodates your
intent as stated above, and leaving all other things untouched.

BTW: (*) This practice has a significant drawback.
  Having multiple places in the text that specifying the same
  thing is very dangerous when it comes to updates, because all
  these places must be kept synchronized correctly.
  One of the latest examples where this became apparent is the
  set of SSH RFCs recently published.  There are some details
  in syntax and semantics specified repeatedly throughout these
  documents, and there obviously have been late changes that
  have not been applied consistently, leading to significant
  inconsistencies and contradictions in the published document
  set.

Best regards,
  Alfred.

Hello,
this is a revised edition of my 'errata and issues' report
on the recently published RFC 4430 authored by you.

I have changed the direction of many proposed corrections
to the text, to accomodate the stated intent of the authors,
as communicated to me by Jan Vilhuber <vilhuber@cisco.com>
in his reply top my original mail.

The items below are presented in textual order, after a 'preface',
item (0), giving the rationale for most of the corrections suggested.

I use change bars ('|' in column 1) and (occasionally) up/down
pointing marker lines to emphasize the location of textual issues
in the snippits from the RFC text and/or the proposed modified text.
Modified text has been adjusted according to RFC formatting policy.


(0)  Rationale for most non-trivial issues listed below:
==============

The initial text of Section 4.2 (on page 16) says:

   Immediately following the header, there is a list of
   Type/Length/Value (TLV) payloads.  There can be any number of
   payloads following the header.  Each payload MUST begin with a
   payload header.  Each payload header is built on the generic payload
   header.  Any data immediately follows the generic header.  Payloads
   are all implicitly aligned to 4-octet boundaries, though the payload
   length field MUST accurately reflect the actual number of octets in
   the payload.

     0                   1                   2                   3
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
    +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
    | Next Payload  |   RESERVED    |         Payload Length        |
    +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
    |                      value (variable)                         |
    +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+

                    Figure 6:  Format of a KINK Payload

   Fields:

     [...]


To sum up: a KINK payload consists of a (generic) payload header
and the (payload) value field.

Unfortunately, the subsequent sub-sections 4.2.* inadvertently
seem to pretend that there exists another copy of the payload
header within the payload value, which certainly was not intended.

It was the intent of the authors to always show and describe the
full payloads in these sections.
Therefore, the repeated text stating to the contrary that it will
show the payload *value*, has to be changed.



(1)  Section 4.2.1 (page 17)

(1a)  typo (word omission)

The final sentence in the 3rd paragraph of Section 4.2.1 says:

                                                            [...].  A
   principal name is case sensitive, and "fqdn" part MUST be lowercase
   as described in [KERBEROS].

It should say:
                                        vvvvv
                                                            [...].  A
|  principal name is case sensitive, and the "fqdn" part MUST be
   lowercase as described in [KERBEROS].

(1b)  see (0) above

The subsequent text, above Figure 7,

   vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
|  The value field of this payload has the following format:

should say:

   vvvvvvvvvvvv
|  This payload has the following format:


(2)  Section 4.2.2 (page 18)

Like (1b) above, the text above Figure 8,

   vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
|  The value field of this payload has the following format:

should say:

   vvvvvvvvvvvv
|  This payload has the following format:


(3)  Section 4.2.3 (page 19)

Like (1b) above, the text above Figure 9,

   vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
|  The value field of this payload has the following format:

should say:

   vvvvvvvvvvvv
|  This payload has the following format:


(4)  Section 4.2.4 (page 20)

(4a) Like (1b) above, the text above Figure 10,

   vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
|  The value field of this payload has the following format:

should say:

   vvvvvvvvvvvv
|  This payload has the following format:

(4b) The second bullet of the subsequent explanations,

     o    PrincName -- The name of the principal that the initiator
          wants to communicate with.  It is assumed that the initiator
          knows the responder's principal name (including the realm
|         name) in the same way as the non-User-to-User case.  The TGT
          returned MUST NOT be an inter-realm TGT and its cname and
          crealm MUST match the requested principal name, so that the
          initiator can rendezvous with the responder at the responder's
          realm.

should say (filling in a missing word):

     o    PrincName -- The name of the principal that the initiator
          wants to communicate with.  It is assumed that the initiator
          knows the responder's principal name (including the realm

          crealm MUST match the requested principal name, so that the
          initiator can rendezvous with the responder at the responder's
          realm.


(5)  Section 4.2.5 (page 21)

Like (1b) above, the text above Figure 11,

   vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
|  The value field of this payload contains the TGT requested in a
   previous KINK_TGT_REQ payload of a GETTGT command.

should say:

   vvvvvvvvvvvv
|  This payload contains the TGT requested in a previous KINK_TGT_REQ
   payload of a GETTGT command.


(6)  Section 4.2.6 (page 21)

Like (1b) above, the text above Figure 12,

   vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
|  The value field of this payload has the following format:

should say:

   vvvvvvvvvvvv
|  This payload has the following format:


(7)  Section 4.2.7 (page 22/23)

(7a) Item (1b) above applies, and plaintext vs. ciphertext is unclear.

The initial text and Figure 13 unfortunately do not properly make
the distinction between unencrypted (plaintext) and encrypted
(ciphertext) values and fields.
The presentation on page 22 needs clarification, according to the
note given on page 23:

   The coverage of the encrypted data begins at InnerNextPload so that
   the first payload's type is kept confidential.  Thus, the number of
   encrypted octets is PayloadLength - 4.

On page 22, the text and Figure 13,

|  The KINK_ENCRYPT payload encapsulates other KINK payloads and is
|  encrypted using the session key and the algorithm specified by its
   etype.  This payload MUST be the final one in the outer payload chain
|  of the message.  The KINK_ENCRYPT payload MUST be encrypted before
   the final KINK checksum is applied.

'encryption payload' used in the text on page 23.)

After the first bullet on page 23,

   Fields:


(7b)  typo, and (7a) continued

The final paragraph of Section 4.2.7, on page 23, says:

                     vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
|  The format of the encryption payload follows the normal Kerberos
   semantics.  Its content is the output of an encrypt function defined
   in the Encryption Algorithm Profile section of [KCRYPTO].  Parameters
   such as encrypt function itself, specific-key, and initial state are
   defined with the etype.  [...]
   itself and there may be some garbage data at the end of the decrypted
   plaintext.  A KINK implementation MUST be prepared to ignore such
   padding after the last sub-payload inside the KINK_ENCRYPT payload.
   [...]

It should say:

                     vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
|  The format of the encrypted KINK_ENCRYPT Payload value follows the
   normal Kerberos semantics.  Its content is the output of an encrypt
   function defined in the Encryption Algorithm Profile section of
|  [KCRYPTO].  Parameters such as the encrypt function itself, specific-
   key, and initial state are defined with the etype.  [...]


(8)  Section 4.2.8

The text of this section twice, and redundantly, specifies
on page 23 :

                          [...].  The error code is in network order.

and on page 24 :

     o    ErrorCode -- One of the following values in the network byte
          order:
          [...]

This looks like a big exception.  But in fact, that is the general
rule as set in the first sentence of Section 4, on page 13!
At best, the former sentence should be deleted, and the latter
bullet changed to say:

     o    ErrorCode -- One of the following values:
          [...]

If it is preferred to not delete the former sentence and the latter
clause, at least the "the" in "in the network byte order" should be
deleted.


(9)  further word omissions in running text

(9a) The first paragraph of Section 6.6, on page 32, says:

   A GETTGT command is only used to carry a Kerberos TGT and is not
   related to SA management; therefore, it contains only KINK_TGT_REQ
   payload and does not contain any DOI-specific payload.

It should say:

   A GETTGT command is only used to carry a Kerberos TGT and is not
|  related to SA management; therefore, it contains only a KINK_TGT_REQ
   payload and does not contain any DOI-specific payload.

(9b) The first paragraph of Section 7, on page 32, says:

   KINK uses the same key derivation mechanisms defined in section 5.5
   of [IKE], which is:

It should say:
                                               vvvv
|  KINK uses the same key derivation mechanisms as defined in section
   5.5 of [IKE], which is:


Items (1)..(7) have been revised on the author's comments received.
In particular, item (7) has been revised substantially to achieve
a selfconsistent presentation in accordance with the author's intent.
I propose to incorporate the above items (1)..(7) and (9) directly
into an RFC Errata Note.
Item (8), and perhaps item (7) as well, still needs judgement from
the RFC authors.

Hello,
in the recently published RFC 4528 (LDAP Assertion Control)
authored by you, I have noted two word omissions that might be
covered by an RFC Errata Note.

(1)

The 2nd paragraph of Section 1, on page 2, says:

   The control may be attached to any update operation to support
   conditional addition, deletion, modification, and renaming of the
   target object.  The asserted condition is evaluated as an integral
   part the operation.

It should say:

   The control may be attached to any update operation to support
   conditional addition, deletion, modification, and renaming of the
   target object.  The asserted condition is evaluated as an integral
|  part of the operation.
       ^^^^

(2)

Within Section 3, the first paragraph on page 3 says:

   When the control is attached to an LDAP request, the processing of
   the request is conditional on the evaluation of the Filter as applied
   against the target of the operation.  If the Filter evaluates to
   TRUE, then the request is processed normally.  If the Filter
   evaluates to FALSE or Undefined, then assertionFailed (122)
   resultCode is returned, and no further processing is performed.

It should say:

   When the control is attached to an LDAP request, the processing of
   the request is conditional on the evaluation of the Filter as applied
   against the target of the operation.  If the Filter evaluates to
   TRUE, then the request is processed normally.  If the Filter
|  evaluates to FALSE or Undefined, then the assertionFailed (122)
   resultCode is returned, and no further processing is performed.


Best regards,

Jan.

Speaking as a long-time member of the Internet technical
community, I would say that such a "common practice" is
quite wrong and misleading.  I agree that it happens,
unfortunately, and perhaps the RFC Editor should catch
it.

For example, when I wrote RFC 2205 on RSVP, I was
quite careful to get this right, while subsequent mods to
2205 have gotten it wrong.

But wrong is wrong, and "common:". is not an excuse. You
could all it pedantic, but if we do not maintain technical
accuracy, what claim can we have to standards making?

Mike, thanks for your quick reply.

I hope I basically do understand the processes.
Please see the RFC Editor's RFC Errata home page,
  <http://www.rfc-editor.org/errata.html>
for RFC Editor policy on Errata.

Errata also serve the purpose of documenting issues that should
be addressed whenever a revision is envisioned.

I'll leave it to the RFC Editor team to request an updated draft,
should the material presented be judged unsuitable for an
Errata Note (as it has happened once last year).

The substantial revision in item (7) is due to the incorporation
of, and adaptation to "the author's intent" as stated in the
comments of your co-author Jan Vilhuber on my initial message.
The corrections to Section 4.2.7 initially proposed were smaller.

Please also note the statement from Bob Braden regarding the
first reply to my initial message, and required accurracy in RFCs
in general, a copy of which I just have received as well.

In the light of this statement, please re-consider my original
proposal as well.

  Alfred.

Well maybe I spoke too hastily, then. It's the style I'm familiar  
with, and the one that first comes to mind. I can't say for sure if  
I've ever seen other styles or not (my memory is notoriously bad), so  
I suppose I'll withdraw the comment...

Note I'm not religious about it. I'm perfectly fine removing the  
redundant header information (though at this stage in the game, do we  
revise rfc's?).

I
When we get a chance, let's talk about whether it seems feasible for
the editor to catch errors of this kind in future RFCs.  I don't think we
should presume to fix it, but it would be nice if we could spot it,
since it is a "common" error.  But perhaps this is going farther into
the content than we can reasonably accomplish.

Hi,

Thank you for the report.  From http://www.rfc-editor.org/errata.html, 
the authors
have to verify the errors.  Kamada-san and I reviewed the report.  
Allmost of them
are correct.  However there are some reports of grammatical errors.  I 
am not certain
that my judgement will be correct in gramatical point of view.
Could someone verify 1a, 4b and 9b ?  And 13a is obviouly correct though 
I have
never seen such little redundant description.  Again, others are correct.

Hello,
this is another instance of feedback messages regarding the
recently published series of new LDAP RFCs.

My general comments on this document series and the precise
documentation of the document evolution contained in these
memos also hold for RFC 4512, and will not be repeated here
for brevity.

The following items labelled "(Ex)" perhaps should be addressed
by an RFC Errata Note.  These items are presented in RFC text order.
Later on, in a second pass through the RFC text, I will also mention
a couple of further textual issues labelled "(Nx)" that might be
worth being noted for use in any future update to the document -
perhaps for Full Standard status.

As usual, I use change bars ('|' in column 1) to emphasize the
location of textual issues and/or proposed corrections, and
proposed new text is adjusted to conform with RFC formatting rules.


(E1)  text truncation (?)

Apparently, the text of the first paragraph of Section 3.2,
on page 18 of RFC 4512, has been truncated inadvertently.
The RFC text says:

   A subentry is a "special sort of entry, known by the Directory, used
   to hold information associated with a subtree or subtree refinement"
|  [X.501].  Subentries are used in Directory to hold for administrative
|  and operational purposes as defined in [X.501].  Their use in LDAP is
   detailed in [RFC3672].

I suspect that it should in fact say:

   A subentry is a "special sort of entry, known by the Directory, used
   to hold information associated with a subtree or subtree refinement"
|  [X.501].  Subentries are used in the Directory to hold attributes for
|  administrative and operational purposes as defined in [X.501].  Their
   use in LDAP is detailed in [RFC3672].


(E2)  typo

In Section 4.1.7.1, near the bottom of page 30, the explanation,

     FORM is specifies the name form associated with this DIT structure
         rule;

should say:

|    FORM specifies the name form associated with this DIT structure
         rule;


(E3)  typo

The first paragraph of Section 5.1, on page 36, says:

   An LDAP server SHALL provide information about itself and other
   information that is specific to each server.  This is represented as
   a group of attributes located in the root DSE, which is named with
|  the DN with zero RDNs (whose [RFC4514] representation is as the
   zero-length string).

It should say:

   An LDAP server SHALL provide information about itself and other
   information that is specific to each server.  This is represented as
   a group of attributes located in the root DSE, which is named with
|  the DN with zero RDNs (whose [RFC4514] representation is the zero-
   length string).


(E4)  word omission

The second paragraph of Section A.2.1, on page 49, says:

   The <descr> syntax was changed to disallow semicolon (U+003B)
   characters in order to appear to be consistent its natural language
   specification "descr is the syntactic representation of an object
   descriptor, which consists of letters and digits, starting with a
   letter".  In a related change, the statement "an AttributeDescription
   can be used as the value in a NAME part of an
   AttributeTypeDescription" was deleted.  RFC 2252 provided no
   specification of the semantics of attribute options appearing in NAME
   fields.

It should say:

   The <descr> syntax was changed to disallow semicolon (U+003B)
|  characters in order to appear to be consistent with its natural
   language specification "descr is the syntactic representation of an
   object descriptor, which consists of letters and digits, starting
   with a letter".
   In a related change, the statement "an AttributeDescription can be
   used as the value in a NAME part of an AttributeTypeDescription" was
   deleted.  RFC 2252 provided no specification of the semantics of
   attribute options appearing in NAME fields.


(E5)  sub-optimal pointer

The second paragraph of Section A.3, at the bottom of page 50, says:

   Section 5.1 of RFC 2256 provided the definition of the 'objectClass'
   attribute type.  This was integrated into Section 2.4.1 of this
   document.  The statement "One of the values is either 'top' or
   'alias'" was replaced with statement that one of the values is 'top'
   as entries belonging to 'alias' also belong to 'top'.

Apparently, 'Section 3.3' would have been much more appropriate than
'Section 2.4.1'.
Therefore, the text should say:

   Section 5.1 of RFC 2256 provided the definition of the 'objectClass'
|  attribute type.  This was integrated into Section 3.3 of this
   document.  The statement "One of the values is either 'top' or
   'alias'" was replaced with statement that one of the values is 'top'
   as entries belonging to 'alias' also belong to 'top'.


And these are my side notes for future consideration.
There are a couple of missing articles in the RFC text.
I have noted the following places:


(N1)

In Section 4.1.1, on page 24, the explanation,

   where:
     <numericoid> is object identifier assigned to this object class;
     [...]

should better say:

   where:
|    <numericoid> is the object identifier assigned to this object
         class;
     [...]


(N2)

In Section 4.1.2,

a) on page 25, the literally same correction as (N1) applies, and

b) the explanation:

     SYNTAX identifies value syntax by object identifier and may suggest
         a minimum upper bound;

should better say:

|    SYNTAX identifies the value syntax by its object identifier and may
         suggest a minimum upper bound;

c) Finally, on top of page 26, the paragraph,

   If SUP field is provided, the EQUALITY, ORDERING, and SUBSTRING
   fields, if not specified, take their value from the supertype.

should better say:

|  If the SUP field is provided, the EQUALITY, ORDERING, and SUBSTRING
   fields, if not specified, take their value from the supertype.


(N3)

In Section 4.1.3, on page 27, -- similarly to (N1) --
the explanation,

   where:
     <numericoid> is object identifier assigned to this matching rule;
     [...]

should better say:

   where:
     <numericoid> is the object identifier assigned to this matching
         rule;
     [...]


(N4)

In Section 4.1.7.2, on page 31, -- again like in (N1) --
the explanation,

   where:
     <numericoid> is object identifier that identifies this name form;
     [...]

should better say:

   where:
     <numericoid> is the object identifier that identifies this name
         form;
     [...]


(N5)

The final sentence of Section 4.2, i.e. the 3rd paragraph on page 33,
says:

   The following subsections provide attribute type definitions for each
   of schema definition attribute types.

It should say:

   The following subsections provide attribute type definitions for each
|  of the schema definition attribute types.


I propose to post an RFC Errata Note for items (E1)..(E5) above.
If you like, items (N1)..(N5) might be included as well.
Please make freely use of the material presented above.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
this is another instance of feedback messages regarding the
recently published series of new LDAP RFCs.

I found one textual issue in RFC 4514:


(1)  singular/plural clash

The leading text for the third example in Section 4 of RFC 4514
(on page 7) says:
                                                v                  v
|  This example shows the method of escaping of a special characters
   appearing in a common name:

It should say:

   appearing in a common name:


I propose to post an RFC Errata Note for this issue,
making use of the text above.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
this is the final instance in a series of feedback messages
regarding the recently published new LDAP RFCs.

My general comments on this document series and the precise
documentation of the document evolution contained in these
memos also hold for RFC 4524, and will not be repeated here
for brevity.

The following items perhaps should be addressed by an RFC Errata
Note, making freely use of the material presented below.
These items are presented in RFC text order.

As usual, I use change bars ('|' in column 1) and up/down pointing
tag lines to emphasize the location of textual issues and/or
proposed corrections.


(1)  referential inconsistency

The second paragraph of Section 1, on page 3 of RFC 4524, says:

   In the years that followed, X.500 Directory Services have evolved to
   incorporate new capabilities and even new protocols.  In particular,
   the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) [RFC4510] was
   introduced in the early 1990s [RFC1487], with Version 3 of LDAP
   introduced in the late 1990s [RFC2251] and subsequently revised in
|  2005 [RFC4510].

It should say:

   In the years that followed, X.500 Directory Services have evolved to
   incorporate new capabilities and even new protocols.  In particular,
   the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) [RFC4510] was
   introduced in the early 1990s [RFC1487], with Version 3 of LDAP
   introduced in the late 1990s [RFC2251] and subsequently revised in
|  2006 [RFC4510].
      ^

(Rationale: RFC 451x and RFC 452x have been published in June 2006.)


(2)  typos

(2a) The third paragraph of Section 1, on page 3 of RFC 4524, says:

|  While much of the material in RFC 1274 has been superceded by
   subsequently published ITU-T Recommendations and IETF RFCs, [...]

It should say:
                                                        v
|  While much of the material in RFC 1274 has been superseded by
   subsequently published ITU-T Recommendations and IETF RFCs, [...]

(2b) The third paragraph of Section 1.1, on page 3, says:

   The description of the 'domain' object class provided in this
|  document supercedes that found in RFC 2247.  That is, Section 3.4 of
   this document replaces Section 5.2 of [RFC2247].

It should say:

   The description of the 'domain' object class provided in this
|  document supersedes that found in RFC 2247.  That is, Section 3.4 of
   this document replaces Section 5.2 of [RFC2247].


(3)  extraneous (duplicated) text

Within Section 3.1 of RFC 4524, the first line on page 14,

   3.3.  documentSeriesExample:

should say:

      Example:


(4)  incomplete information

Within Appendix A of RFC 4524, I miss a note describing the fate
of the 'pilotOrganization' object class (RFC 1274, Section 8.3.13).

Kurt:
  For completeness, it would be nice if you could provide
  supplementary text (similar to, and perhaps to be inserted
  after, section A.3 of RFC 4524) detailing the intentions of
  the authors regarding that object class.


Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
I'd like to send you a few notes on textual issues I found
studying the recently published RFC 4293 (IP MIB) edited by you.

( Admittedly, very few textual issues are left there, in an RFC
  of such extraneous size! )

I use change bars ('|' in column 1) to emphasize the location
of textual issues and/or proposed changes in the text snippits.
Modified text is re-adjusted to conform with RFC formatting rules.


(1)  inappropriate unit for bandwith

Throughout the annotating RFC text and the DESCRIPTION clauses
in the MIB module, erroneously an inappropriate physical unit
is used for the bandwidth of interfaces.
  'MB'   = Megabytes  = 2**10 Bytes
is only useful to measure storage volume.
Certainly,
  'Mbps' = Megabits per second = 10**6 bits per second
           [ Note the lowercase 'b' ! ]
should be used to measure the bandwidth of interfaces.

To correct this issue, the following corrections should be applied
to RFC 4293:

(1a)

The second paragraph of Section 3.2.11, on page 10, says:

   The circumstances used in the compliance section are implementing
   IPv4, IPv6, or IPv6 router functions and having a bandwidth of less
   than 20MB, between 20MB and 650MB, or greater than 650MB.

It should say:

   The circumstances used in the compliance section are implementing
   IPv4, IPv6, or IPv6 router functions and having a bandwidth of less
|  than 20Mbps, between 20Mbps and 650Mbps, or greater than 650Mbps.

(1b)

The DESCRIPTION clause of the ipSystemStatsHCOctetGroup, on page 87,
says:

           "This group is mandatory for systems that have an aggregate
            bandwidth of greater than 20MB.  Including this group does
            not allow an entity to neglect the 32 bit versions of these
            objects."

It should say:

           "This group is mandatory for systems that have an aggregate
|           bandwidth of greater than 20Mbps.  Including this group does
            not allow an entity to neglect the 32 bit versions of these
            objects."

(1c)

The DESCRIPTION clause of the ipSystemStatsHCPacketGroup,
on page 87/88, says:

           "This group is mandatory for systems that have an aggregate
            bandwidth of greater than 650MB.  Including this group
<< page break >>
            does not allow an entity to neglect the 32 bit versions of
            these objects."

It should say:

           "This group is mandatory for systems that have an aggregate
|           bandwidth of greater than 650Mbps.  Including this group
<< page break >>
            does not allow an entity to neglect the 32 bit versions of
            these objects."

(1d)

The DESCRIPTION clause of the ipIfStatsHCOctetGroup, on page 88,
says:

           "This group is mandatory for systems that include the
            ipIfStatsGroup and include links with bandwidths of greater
            than 20MB.  Including this group does not allow an entity to
            neglect the 32 bit versions of these objects."

It should say:

           "This group is mandatory for systems that include the
            ipIfStatsGroup and include links with bandwidths of greater
|           than 20Mbps.  Including this group does not allow an entity
            to neglect the 32 bit versions of these objects."

(1e)

The DESCRIPTION clause of the ipIfStatsHCPacketGroup, on page 88,
says:

           "This group is mandatory for systems that include the
            ipIfStatsGroup and include links with bandwidths of greater
            than 650MB.  Including this group does not allow an entity
            to neglect the 32 bit versions of these objects."

It should say:

           "This group is mandatory for systems that include the
            ipIfStatsGroup and include links with bandwidths of greater
|           than 650Mbps.  Including this group does not allow an entity
            to neglect the 32 bit versions of these objects."

(1f)

The DESCRIPTION clause of the ipv4SystemStatsHCPacketGroup,
onpage 88, says:

           "This group is mandatory for all systems supporting IPv4 and
            that have an aggregate bandwidth of greater than 650MB.
            Including this group does not allow an entity to neglect the
            32 bit versions of these objects."

It should say:

           "This group is mandatory for all systems supporting IPv4 and
|           that have an aggregate bandwidth of greater than 650Mbps.
            Including this group does not allow an entity to neglect the
            32 bit versions of these objects."


(2)  improperly replicated description text

On page 35, the DESCRIPTION clauses of the ipSystemStatsOutFragReqds
OBJECT-TYPE and the ipSystemStatsOutFragOKs OBJECT-TYPE erroneously
contain identical clauses.

After analysis of the context it becomes apparent that the
DESCRIPTION clause of the ipSystemStatsOutFragReqds OBJECT-TYPE,

           "The number of IP datagrams that would require fragmentation
            in order to be transmitted.

            When tracking interface statistics, the counter of the
            outgoing interface is incremented for a successfully
            fragmented datagram.

            [...]

in fact should say:

           "The number of IP datagrams that would require fragmentation
            in order to be transmitted.

            When tracking interface statistics, the counter of the
|           outgoing interface is incremented for a datagram requiring
|           fragmentation.

            [...]

(Note: The original text is appropriate in the DESCRIPTION clause of
 the ipSystemStatsOutFragOKs OBJECT-TYPE, where it appears again.)


(3)  improperly replicated description text

On page 36, the DESCRIPTION clause of the ipSystemStatsOutFragCreates
OBJECT-TYPE says:

           "The number of output datagram fragments that have been
            generated as a result of IP fragmentation.

            When tracking interface statistics, the counter of the
|           outgoing interface is incremented for a successfully
|           fragmented datagram.

            [...]

Obviously, the second sentence contradicts the first one.
( Apparently, this is an un-edited copy from the DESCRIPTION clauses
  mentioned above, in item (2), that needs editing to be appropriate.)

Therefore, the RFC should say:

           "The number of output datagram fragments that have been
            generated as a result of IP fragmentation.

            When tracking interface statistics, the counter of the
            outgoing interface is incremented for a successfully
|           created datagram fragment.

            [...]


(4)  improperly replicated description text

On page 52, a "mirror" of issue (2) recurs, for the Interface
Statistics.

The DESCRIPTION clause of the ipIfStatsOutFragReqds OBJECT-TYPE
says:

           "The number of IP datagrams that would require fragmentation
            in order to be transmitted.

            When tracking interface statistics, the counter of the
|           outgoing interface is incremented for a successfully
|           fragmented datagram.

            [...]

It should say:

           "The number of IP datagrams that would require fragmentation
            in order to be transmitted.

            When tracking interface statistics, the counter of the
|           outgoing interface is incremented for a datagram requiring
|           fragmentation.

            [...]


(5)  improperly replicated description text

On page 53, a "mirror" of issue (3) recurs, for the Interface
Statistics.

The DESCRIPTION clause of the ipIfStatsOutFragCreates OBJECT-TYPE
says:

           "The number of output datagram fragments that have been
            generated as a result of IP fragmentation.

            When tracking interface statistics, the counter of the
|           outgoing interface is incremented for a successfully
|           fragmented datagram.

            [...]

It should say:

           "The number of output datagram fragments that have been
            generated as a result of IP fragmentation.

            When tracking interface statistics, the counter of the
            outgoing interface is incremented for a successfully
|           created datagram fragment.

            [...]


(6)  wrong object name

On page 60, the DESCRIPTION clause of the ipAddressPrefixType
OBJECT-TYPE,

           "The address type of ipAddressPrefix."

mentions an object that does not exist in the MIB module.
That clause in fact should say:

|          "The address type of ipAddressPrefixPrefix."


(7)  two typos

On page 76, there are two typos in the ipDefaultRouterPreference
OBJECT-TYPE invocation:

The DESCRIPTION clause,

           "An indication of preference given to this router as a
            default router as described in he Default Router
            Preferences document.  [...]

should say:

           "An indication of preference given to this router as a
|           default router as described in the Default Router
            Preferences document.  [...]
                                          ^^
And the clause,

    REFERENCE "RFC 4291, section 2.1"

should say:

|   REFERENCE "RFC 4191, section 2.1"
                    ^

(Otherwise, Ref. [8] would not have been needed at all!)



I propose that you submit an Author's Errata Note for RFC 4293
to address these issues, making freely use of the material
presented above -- or just state your consent to this message
to the RFC Editor.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
after studying the recently published RFC 4295 (MOBILEIPV6-MIB)
authored by you, I would like to submit a few comments, pointing
out some issues I found with the RFC text, and supplying material
for an appropriate RFC Errata Note.

The items below are presented in RFC textual order.
I use change bars ('|' in column 1) and occasionally
up/down pointing marker lines ('^^^'/'vvv') to emphasize
the location of textual issues and/or proposed corrections.
Modified text has been re-adjusted to match RFC formatting
rules, where appropriate.


(1)  MIB object naming scheme broken

It is accepted consensus in the IETF to use a common, mnemonic scheme
for the naming of tables, table rows, and columnar objects within
these rows, namely (variable text to be instantiated shown as <..>):

          <tableName>Table
            <tableName>Entry
              <tableName><Object1>
              <tableName><Object2>
               ...
              <tableName><Objectn>
or:
          <tableName>Table
            <tableName>Entry
              <tableNameShort><Object1>
              <tableNameShort><Object2>
               ...
              <tableNameShort><Objectn>
where
  <tableNameShort> is an abbreviated version of <tableName> .

Unfortunately, the mip6NodeTraffic counter table breaks this scheme.
Page 24 of RFC 4295 specifies:

        Mip6NodeTrafficEntry ::=
           SEQUENCE {
                 mip6NodeInOctets             Counter32,
|                mip6HCNodeInOctets           Counter64,
                 mip6NodeInPkts               Counter32,
|                mip6HCNodeInPkts             Counter64,
                 mip6NodeOutOctets            Counter32,
|                mip6HCNodeOutOctets          Counter64,
                 mip6NodeOutPkts              Counter32,
|                mip6HCNodeOutPkts            Counter64,
                 mip6NodeCtrDiscontinuityTime TimeStamp
           }

As can be seen, the irregularity is in the 'HC' (Counter64) names;
"mip6HCNodeXxx" should have been replaced by "mip6NodeHCXxx", i.e.,

        Mip6NodeTrafficEntry ::=
           SEQUENCE {
                 mip6NodeInOctets             Counter32,
|                mip6NodeHCInOctets           Counter64,
                 mip6NodeInPkts               Counter32,
|                mip6NodeHCInPkts             Counter64,
                 mip6NodeOutOctets            Counter32,
|                mip6NodeHCOutOctets          Counter64,
                 mip6NodeOutPkts              Counter32,
|                mip6NodeHCOutPkts            Counter64,
                 mip6NodeCtrDiscontinuityTime TimeStamp
           }

As the published irregular object names cannot be changed easily
after the fact, I hereby propose to introduce the regular object
names in a future update to the MIB module as *aliases* to the
irregular ones, bound to the same OIDs.
Of course,
-  the OBJECT-TYPE declarations of the four affected MIB objects,
   on page 25..28, and
-  the definition of the mip6NodeTrafficGroup OBJECT-GROUP,
   on page 81
would have to be adjusted accordingly.

( Perhaps, it would be best to change the symbolic object names
  in the above SEQUENCE definition, and in the OBJECT-TYPE and
  OBJECT-GROUP definitions, and add new OBJECT IDENTIFIER
  definitions to introduce the old, irregular names again,
  with the same OIDs, for backwards compatibility.)


(2)  wrong object name in cloned DESCRIPTION clause

The DESCRIPTION clause of the mip6HCNodeOutPkts OBJECT-TYPE
declaration, on page 28 of RFC 4295, apparently has been
cloned from another object without proper editing, and thus
refers to a wrong object, mip6NodeOutOctets, where it should
refer to the object, mip6NodeOutPkts.
Thus, the DESCRIPTION text (in the 12th line on page 28),

                   [...]
|                  This object is a 64-bit version of mip6NodeOutOctets.
                   [...]
should say:
                   [...]
|                  This object is a 64-bit version of mip6NodeOutPkts.
                   [...]


(3)  clarification (text too much abbreviated)

The DESCRIPTION clause of the mip6MnHomeAddressState OBJECT-TYPE,
on page 30, suffers from a couple of word omissions.

The text:

                    home        -- mobile node is on the home network.
                    registered  -- mobile node is on a foreign network
                                   and is registered with the home
                                   agent.
                    pending     -- mobile node has sent registration
                                   request to the home agent and is
                                   waiting for the reply.
                    isolated    -- mobile node is isolated from network,
                                   i.e., it is not in its home network,
                                   it is not registered, and no
                                   registration ack is pending.

should perhaps better say:

|                   home        -- the mobile node is on the home
                                   network.
|                   registered  -- the mobile node is on a foreign
                                   network and is registered with the
                                   home agent.
|                   pending     -- the mobile node has sent a
                                   registration request to the home
                                   agent and is waiting for the reply.
|                   isolated    -- the mobile node is isolated from its
|                                  home network, i.e., it is not in its
                                   home network, it is not registered,
                                   and no registration ack is pending.


(4)  typo

The DESCRIPTION clause of the mip6MnBLAcceptedTime OBJECT-TYPE,
on page 39, says:

                    been accepted (status code 0 or 1);
                    [...]

It should say:

or even better (similar to the mip6MnBLAccepted DESCRIPTION on the
same page):

                    Update has been accepted (status code 0 or 1);

(6)  description too unspecific

The DESCRIPTION clause of the mip6CnCompliance MODULE-COMPLIANCE,
on page 94, says:

                  "The compliance statement for SNMP entities

|                  support monitoring of the basic correspondent node
|                  functionality.

This is the same description text as supplied for the
mip6CnCoreCompliance (on the same page), and hence does not
suffice to distinguish these two compliance statements.

The above text perhaps should say:

                  "The compliance statement for SNMP entities
                   that implement the MOBILEIPV6-MIB and support
                   monitoring of the basic correspondent node

deleted since write access is not required.



Please comment.
All but item (1) seems to be appropriate for an Errata Note.
Preferrably, you should submit an Author's Errata Note to the
RFC Editor's RFC Errata web pages, making freely use of the
material supplied above.  But if you like, I can formally
submit an Errata Note on my own, with your consent.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
triggered by the recent publication of the iSCSI MIB RFC, I have
also studied the earlier RFC 4455 (SCSI MIB) authored by you.
I would like to submit a bunch of comments on this RFC as well,
pointing out some issues I found with the RFC text, and supplying
material for an appropriate RFC Errata Note.

The items below are presented in RFC textual order.
I use change bars ('|' in column 1) and occasionally
up/down pointing marker lines ('^^^'/'vvv') to emphasize
the location of textual issues and/or proposed corrections.
Modified text has been re-adjusted to match RFC formatting
rules, where appropriate.


(1)  typo

Section 3.5 of RFC 4455, on page 11, says:

   The management of SCSI commands is beyond the scope of this MIB
|  module.  Future SCSI Command MIB module can link to this MIB module,
   through the use of Object Identifiers (OIDs) or INDEX values of
   appropriate tables.

It should say:
                                          v
   The management of SCSI commands is beyond the scope of this MIB
|  module.  Future SCSI Command MIB modules can link to this MIB module,
   through the use of Object Identifiers (OIDs) or INDEX values of
   appropriate tables.


(2)  typo

Section 4.1 of RFC 4455, on page 11, says:

   The scsiDeviceGroup group contains the objects general to each SCSI
   instance: instance, device, and port objects.  It contains also the
   objects referring to the transport(s) used by those SCSI instances.
|  This group is mandatory for all SCSI managed system.

It should say:

   The scsiDeviceGroup group contains the objects general to each SCSI
   instance: instance, device, and port objects.  It contains also the
   objects referring to the transport(s) used by those SCSI instances.
|  This group is mandatory for all SCSI managed systems.
                                                      ^

(3)  word omission

The second paragraph of Section 4.7, on page 12, says:

   Managed systems acting as a SCSI target device and port and running
|  at high speed supporting should implement this group.

It should say:

   Managed systems acting as a SCSI target device and port and running
|  at high speed supporting statistics should implement this group.
                           ^^^^^^^^^^^


(4)  word omission

The second paragraph of Section 4.11, on page 13, says:

   Managed systems acting as a SCSI initiator device and port and
   running at high speed supporting should implement this group.

It should say:

   Managed systems acting as a SCSI initiator device and port and
|  running at high speed supporting statistics should implement this
   group.
                                   ^^^^^^^^^^^

(5)  text truncation

The DESCRIPTION clause of the scsiTransportFCP OBJECT-IDENTITY,
on page 24, says:

        "This identity identifies a Fibre Channel Protocol for SCSI,
        Second Version."

This sentence omits the most significant word, "transport".
It should say:

        "This identity identifies a Fibre Channel Protocol for SCSI,
|       Second Version, transport."
                      ^^^^^^^^^^^
or:
                                 vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
|       "This identity identifies transport via the Fibre Channel
        Protocol for SCSI, Second Version."


(6)  incomplete description, and incomplete functionality ??

The DESCRIPTION clause of the scsiPortBusyStatuses OBJECT-TYPE,
on page 30, says:

        [...]
        Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-
        initialization of the management system."

Admittedly, this is true, but more importantly, the counter can
wrap back from 2^32-1 to 0 !!!
That should be noted there, and it should be detectable by means
of some 'discontinuity time stamp' object in the MIB module.


(7)  as (6) above

The same issue as stated in item (6) above also holds for the
scsiIntrDevOutResets OBJECT-TYPE, on page 33.


(8)  as (6) above

The same issue as stated in item (6) above also holds for all
counters in the SCSI Initiator Port Table, i.e. the DESCRIPTIONs
of the scsiIntrPortOutCommands, scsiIntrPortWrittenMegaBytes,
scsiIntrPortReadMegaBytes, and scsiIntrPortHSOutCommands
OBJECT-TYPEs, on page 35.


(9)  typo

The ASN.1 comment on top of page 36,

   -- SCSI target device discovered or authorized to attach each of the
   -- SCSI initiator ports of each SCSI initiator device of each
   -- instance.

should say:
                        v
|  -- SCSI target devices discovered or authorized to attach each of the
   -- SCSI initiator ports of each SCSI initiator device of each
   -- instance.


(10)  typo (spurious word)

The DESCRIPTION clause of the scsiDscTgtIndex OBJECT-TYPE, on page 37,
says:

        "This object is an arbitrary integer used to uniquely identify
        a particular SCSI target device either discovered by, or
|       configured for use with, one or more ports scsiDscTgtName of
        a particular device within a particular SCSI instance."

The spurious word "scsiDscTgtName" should be deleted.
Thus, it should say:

        "This object is an arbitrary integer used to uniquely identify
        a particular SCSI target device either discovered by, or
|       configured for use with, one or more ports of a particular
        device within a particular SCSI instance."


(11)  typo (spurious word)

The DESCRIPTION clause of the scsiDscTgtDevOrPort OBJECT-TYPE,
on page 37, says:

        "This object indicates whether this entry describes a
|       configured SCSI target device name (and applies to all ports
        on the identified SCSI target device) or an individual SCSI
        target port."

The spurious word "name" should be deleted.
Thus, it should say:

        "This object indicates whether this entry describes a
|       configured SCSI target device (and applies to all ports
        on the identified SCSI target device) or an individual SCSI
        target port."


(12)  similar to (6), and semantic overloading

The DESCRIPTION clause of the scsiDscTgtInCommands OBJECT-TYPE,
on page 38, says:

         [...]
         Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-
         initialization of the management system, and at other times as
         indicated by the value of scsiDscTgtLastCreation."

The literally same wording is repeated on page 39 in the DESCRIPTION
clauses of the OBJECT-TYPEs
-  scsiDscTgtWrittenMegaBytes,
-  scsiDscTgtReadMegaBytes, and
-  scsiDscTgtHSInCommands.

See the explanations for item (6) above.

The DESCRIPTION clause of the scsiDscTgtLastCreation OBJECT-TYPE,
at the bottom of page 39, says:

        "This object represents the value of sysUpTime when this row
|       was created."

Counter wrap-around isn't table row creation.
Thus, isn't the above referral heavy semantic overloading of
"Last Creation" time ??


(13)  typo

The ASN.1 comment near the bottom of page 43,

|  --***** Table of SCSI Target Device Attached to local SCSI
   --***** Initiator Ports

should say:
                                      v
|  --***** Table of SCSI Target Devices Attached to local SCSI
   --***** Initiator Ports


(14)  as (6) above

The DESCRIPTION clauses, on page 49, of the OBJECT-TYPEs
-  scsiTgtPortInCommands,
-  scsiTgtPortWrittenMegaBytes,
-  scsiTgtPortReadMegaBytes, and
-  scsiTgtPortHSInCommands
contain the sentence,

        Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-
        initialization of the management system."

the explanations given for item (6) above apply here as well.


(15)  improper wording

The DESCRIPTION clause of the scsiTgtPortHSInCommands OBJECT-TYPE,
on page 49, says:

        "This object represents the number of commands received.  This
|       object provides support for systems that can quickly generate a
        large number of commands because they run at high speed.
        [...]

Because this object counts *incoming* commands, the word "generate"
is considered improper and should be replaced by "accept" (or similar):

        "This object represents the number of commands received.  This
|       object provides support for systems that can quickly accept a
        large number of commands because they run at high speed.
        [...]


(16)  like (12) above

The SCSI Authorized Initiator table suffers from the same problems
as the Target Device Discovered Table (Item (12) above):

The DESCRIPTION clauses (on pages 52/53) of the OBJECT-TYPEs
-  scsiAuthIntrAttachedTimes,
-  scsiAuthIntrOutCommands,
-  scsiAuthIntrReadMegaBytes,
-  scsiAuthIntrWrittenMegaBytes, and
-  scsiAuthIntrHSOutCommands
each contain the identical sentence:

        Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-
        initialization of the management system, and at other times as
        indicated by the value of scsiAuthIntrLastCreation."

and the DESCRIPTION clause of the scsiAuthIntrLastCreation OBJECT-TYPE,
on page 53, says:

        "This object indicates the value of sysUpTime when this row was
        last created."

Counter wrap-around isn't table row creation.
Thus, isn't the above referral heavy semantic overloading of
"Last Creation" time ??


(17)  again, like (12) above

The SCSI LU table suffers from the same problems as above:

The DESCRIPTION clauses (on pages 60..62) of the OBJECT-TYPEs
-  scsiLuInCommands,
-  scsiLuReadMegaBytes,
-  scsiLuWrittenMegaBytes,
-  scsiLuInResets,
-  scsiLuOutTaskSetFullStatus, and
-  scsiLuHSInCommands
each contain the identical sentence:

        Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-
        initialization of the management system, and at other times as
        indicated by the value of scsiLuLastCreation."

while the DESCRIPTION clause of the scsiLuLastCreation OBJECT-TYPE,
on page 62, says:

        "This object indicates the value of sysUpTime when this row was
        last created."

Again, counter wrap-around isn't table row creation.
Thus, isn't the above referral heavy semantic overloading of
"Last Creation" time ??


(18)  MIB structure inconsistency ???

On page 66, RFC 4455 says:

   --********************** Notifications ******************************
|  -- scsiNotifications OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { scsiMIB  2 }
                                                        ^^^

   scsiNotificationsPrefix OBJECT IDENTIFIER
                                ::= { scsiNotifications 0 }

This is very notable, since on page 23, the same RFC has
specified:

   --****************** Structure of the MIB **************************
|  scsiNotifications OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { scsiMIB 0 }
   [...]
                                                    ^^^

At least, giving different values for the same object name
(though one instance is in an ASN.1 comment) is irritating.

The trailing OID component '0' is required for SNMPv1 backwards
compatibility.  Since it is already contained in the effective
'scsiNotifications' OID (as specified on page 23), the additional
introduction of 'scsiNotificationsPrefix' seems to be very
redundant.  Its use could be easily substituted by the use of
'scsiNotifications' in the two NOTIFICATION-TYPE invocations
on page 66, which would have resulted in the OID assignments,

   scsiTgtDeviceStatusChanged NOTIFICATION-TYPE
      [...]
   ::= { scsiNotifications 1 }

and

   scsiLuStatusChanged NOTIFICATION-TYPE
      [...]
   ::= { scsiNotifications 2 }

as usual in IETF MIBs.

That is now too late to be corrected, but the misleading ASN.1 comment
on page 66 of the RFC, as noted above, should be corrected to say:

   --********************** Notifications ******************************
|  -- scsiNotifications OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { scsiMIB  0 }
                                                        ^^^

(19)  typo

The ASN.1 comment on page 67,

      -- Conditionally mandatory groups to be included with
      -- the mandatory groups when the implementation has
|     -- SCSI target device.

should say:

      -- Conditionally mandatory groups to be included with
      -- the mandatory groups when the implementation has
|     -- SCSI target devices.
                           ^

(20)  typo

The DESCRIPTION clause of the scsiInitiatorDeviceGroup OBJECT-GROUP
invocation, on page 71, says:

        "This group is relevant for s SCSI initiator device and port."

should say:
                                    v
|       "This group is relevant for a SCSI initiator device and port."

or even better:

|       "This group is relevant for SCSI initiator devices and ports."


(21)  duplicate / redundant text

Section 10, on page 76, contains the 5th paragraph:

   We assume an HBA as the SCSI initiator device and a disk as the SCSI
   target device.  We assume that the SCSI target device has one logical
   unit, addressed by Logical Unit Number set to 0 (LUN0), which is the
   default LUN.  Parallel SCSI has only port identifiers, no port names.
   The transport pointer for parallel SCSI is set to 0 since there is no
   reference transport (SPI) MIB module.

This text is a slightly modified restatement of what is said in the
directly preceeding paragraph.
Thus, this paragraph should be deleted.


Please comment.

Apparently, many of the items above should be addressed by an
RFC Errata Note.  Other items should be considered in your WG
for a future update to the MIB module.

Preferrably, you should submit an Author's Errata Note to the
RFC Editor's RFC Errata web pages, making freely use of the
material supplied above.  But if you like, I can formally
submit an Errata Note on my own, with your consent.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
after studying the recently published Fibre Channel MIB RFCs,
I would like to submit a few comments on RFC 4438 authored by you,
pointing out the issues I found with the RFC text, and supplying
material for an appropriate RFC Errata Note.

The items below are presented in RFC textual order.
I use change bars ('|' in column 1) and occasionally
up/down pointing marker lines ('^^^'/'vvv') to emphasize
the location of textual issues and/or proposed corrections.
Modified text has been re-adjusted to match RFC formatting
rules, where appropriate.


(1)  outdated DESCRIPTION, inconsistent with introduction

On page 6, Section 5.3 of RFC 4438 says:

   The [FC-SW-3] standard for an interconnecting Fabric consisting of
   multiple Fabric Switch elements describes the operation of a single
   Fabric in a physical infrastructure.  The current [FC-SW-4] standard
   also supports the operation of multiple Virtual Fabrics operating
   within one (or more) physical infrastructures.  In such a scenario,
   each Fabric has, of course, its own management instrumentation.  In
   order to accommodate this scenario, this MIB module defines all
   Fabric-related information in tables that are INDEXed by an arbitrary
   integer, named a "Fabric Index".  In a Fabric that is conformant to
   [FC-SW-3], the value of this Fabric Index will always be 1.

Contrary to that, the DESCRIPTION clause of the t11NsRegFabricIndex
OBJECT-TYPE, on top of page 16, says:

           However, it is possible that future standards will define
           how multiple Fabrics, each with its own management
           instrumentation, could operate within one (or more) physical
           infrastructures.  To allow for this future possibility, this
           index value is used to uniquely identify a particular
           Fabric within a physical infrastructure."

Apparently, the latter text is outdated.
Please revise this text for an Errata Note.


(2)  improper DESCRIPTION text

The DESCRIPTION clause of the t11NsRegClassOfSvc OBJECT-TYPE,
on page 16/17, says:

           "The class of service indicator.  This object is an
           array of bits that contain a bit map of the classes of
           service supported by the associated port.  If a bit in
<< page break >>
           this object is 1, it indicates that the class of
           service is supported by the associated port.  When a
|          bit is set to 0, it indicates that no class of service
|          is supported by this Nx_Port.

|          If this object has not been not registered for a port,
           then the instance for that port is not instantiated."

This is partially wrong or misleading.
Perhaps, this text should be corrected to say:

           "The class of service indicator.  This object is an
           array of bits that contain a bit map of the classes of
           service supported by the associated port.  If a bit in
<< page break >>
           this object is 1, it indicates that the class of
           service is supported by the associated port.  When a
|          bit is set to 0, it indicates that the corresponding class
|          of service is not supported by this Nx_Port.

|          If this object has not been registered for a port,
           then the instance for that port is not instantiated."


(3)  typo (word omission)

The DESCRIPTION clause of the t11NsRegHardAddress OBJECT-TYPE,
on page 19, contains the bullet:

             - the 8-bit AL-PA (Arbitrated Loop Physical Address)
|              which an NL_Port attempts acquire during FC-AL
               initialization in the least significant byte.

It should say:

             - the 8-bit AL-PA (Arbitrated Loop Physical Address)
|              which an NL_Port attempts to acquire during FC-AL
               initialization in the least significant byte.


(4)  inappropriate application of boilerplate text

The text of Section 11, on page 33, begins with the sentence:

            vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
   There is one management object defined in this MIB module with a
|  MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  [...]
                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is quite silly -- "and/or" does not make any sense here.
The single object that falls within this boilerplate category
can either have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write *or* it has
a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-create (the former is true, as can
be seen on page 14).  Using "or" instead of "and/or" might be
aceeptible, but I propose to simplify the sentence further.

The above sentence should be corrected to say:

   There is one management object defined in this MIB module with a
|  MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write.  [...]

Also, the subsequent boilerplate text,

   Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some
|  network environments.  For example, the ability to change network
|  topology or network speed may afford an attacker the ability to
|  obtain better performance at the expense of other network users.  The
   support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
   protection can have a negative effect on network operations.

seems rather inappropriate in this case -- [not] sending of
notifications will rarely "change network topology or network speed".


Please comment.

Preferrably, you should submit an Author's Errata Note to the
RFC Editor's RFC Errata web pages, making freely use of the
material supplied above.  But if you like, I can formally
submit an Errata Note on my own, with your consent.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

pointing out the issues I found with the RFC text, and supplying

I use change bars ('|' in column 1) and occasionally
up/down pointing marker lines ('^^^'/'vvv') to emphasize
the location of textual issues and/or proposed corrections.
Modified text has been re-adjusted to match RFC formatting
rules, where appropriate.


(1)  typo (missing article)

On page 16, the third paragraph of the DESCRIPTION clause for the
t11FamAutoReconfigure OBJECT-TYPE macro invocation says:

|          If value of this object is 'true', the switch will
           send an RCF (ReConfigureFabric) to rebuild the
           Fabric.

It should say:

             vvvvv
|          If the value of this object is 'true', the switch will
           send an RCF (ReConfigureFabric) to rebuild the
           Fabric.



(2)  typo (missing article)

On page 17, the first paragraph of the DESCRIPTION clause for the
t11FamPriority OBJECT-TYPE macro invocation says:

           "The initial or configured priority of a particular switch
|          to be used in Principal Switch selection process.

It should say:

           "The initial or configured priority of a particular switch
|          to be used in the Principal Switch selection process.
                        ^^^^^


(3)  "s/e\.g\./i\.e\./"

On page 19, the t11FamAvailableFcIds OBJECT-TYPE DESCRIPTION clause
says:

           "The number of Fibre Channel Address Identifiers that are
           unassigned and currently available for immediate assignment
|          on the Fabric, e.g., with the 'Clean Address' bit set to 1."
                          ^^^^
It should say:

           "The number of Fibre Channel Address Identifiers that are
           unassigned and currently available for immediate assignment
|          on the Fabric, i.e., with the 'Clean Address' bit set to 1."
                          ^^^^


(4)  redundant text

The DESCRIPTION clauses for t11FamRestart, t11FamRcFabricNotifyEnable,
t11FamEnable, and t11FamFabricName (on pages 22..24) all contain the
same phrase:

           For the persistence of values across reboots, see the
           MODULE-IDENTITY's DESCRIPTION clause."

This is a very complicated way to say nothing.  (The named
clause says: the behaviour is implementation dependent.)
Perhaps it would have been better to omit this phrase in all
instances.


(5)  typo (wrong word)

The third paragraph of the DESCRIPTION clause for
t11FamRcFabricNotifyEnable, on page 22, says:

           If an implementation requires all Fabrics to have the
           same value, then setting one instance of this object
|          to a new object will result in all corresponding
           instances being set to that same new value.

It should say (replacing 'object' by 'value'):

           If an implementation requires all Fabrics to have the
           same value, then setting one instance of this object
|          to a new value will result in all corresponding
           instances being set to that same new value.


(6)  typo (word omission)

The DESCRIPTION clause of the t11FamIfTable OBJECT-TYPE macro
invocation, on page 24, contains the bullet:
                                                      v
|          c) the row in the t11FamTable corresponding the fabric
              identified by t11FamFabricID no longer exists.

It should say:
                                                      vvvv
|          c) the row in the t11FamTable corresponding to the fabric
              identified by t11FamFabricID no longer exists.


Please comment.

Preferrably, you should submit an Author's Errata Note to the
RFC Editor's RFC Errata web pages to address the above items,
perhaps with the exception of item (4), making freely use of
the material supplied above.  But if you like, I can formally
submit an Errata Note on my own, with your consent.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
in January, the new BGP-4 RFCs have been published.
Unfortunately, I did not find the time to report the
textual issues I found in these documents until now.

This message addresses RFC 4274 (BGP-4 Protocol Analysis)
authored by you, pointing out some issues I found with the
RFC text, and supplying material for an appropriate
RFC Errata Note.

The items below are presented in RFC textual order.
I use change bars ('|' in column 1) and occasionally
up/down pointing marker lines ('^^^'/'vvv') to emphasize
the location of textual issues and/or proposed corrections.
Modified text has been re-adjusted to match RFC formatting
rules, where appropriate.


(1)  typo (missing word)

The second paragraph of Section 2.2, on page 4 of RFC 4274, says:

   BGP uses an incremental update strategy to conserve bandwidth and
|  processing power.  That is, after initial exchange of complete
   routing information, a pair of BGP routers exchanges only the changes
   to that information.  [...]

It should say:

   BGP uses an incremental update strategy to conserve bandwidth and
|  processing power.  That is, after the initial exchange of complete
   routing information, a pair of BGP routers exchanges only the changes
   to that information.  [...]


(2)  typo

Section 2.3 contains (on page 5) the state description:

   ACTIVE:         State in which BGP peer is trying to acquire a peer
|                  by listening and accepting TCP connection.

It should say:

   ACTIVE:         State in which BGP peer is trying to acquire a peer
|                  by listening and accepting a TCP connection.
                                             ^^^

(An alternative correction, replacing 'connection' by 'connections',
 does not precisely reflect the desired behaviour.)


(3)  typos (multiple missing articles)

Section 4 of RFC 4274, on page 6, says:

   Whenever a BGP speaker detects an error in a peer connection, it
   shuts down the peer and changes its FSM state to IDLE.  BGP speaker
   requires a Start event to re-initiate an idle peer connection.  If
   the error remains persistent and BGP speaker generates a Start event
   automatically, then it may result in persistent peer flapping.
   Although peer oscillation is found to be wide-spread in BGP
   implementations, methods for preventing persistent peer oscillations
   are outside the scope of base BGP specification.

It should say:

   Whenever a BGP speaker detects an error in a peer connection, it
|  shuts down the peer and changes its FSM state to IDLE.  A BGP speaker
   requires a Start event to re-initiate an idle peer connection.  If
|  the error remains persistent and the BGP speaker generates a Start
   event automatically, then it may result in persistent peer flapping.
   Although peer oscillation is found to be wide-spread in BGP
   implementations, methods for preventing persistent peer oscillations
|  are outside the scope of the base BGP specification.


(4)  inconsistency in updated text

The text of section 6.1 has been revised substantially from its
predecessor, RFC 1774.  Unfortunately, the modifications have
not been performed incompletely, leading to near-nonsense text.
Section 6.1, on page 7, says:

   Immediately after the initial BGP connection setup, BGP peers
   exchange complete sets of routing information.  If we denote the
   total number of routes in the Internet as N, the total path
   attributes (for all N routes) received from a peer as A, and assume
   that the networks are uniformly distributed among the autonomous
   systems, then the worst-case amount of bandwidth consumed during the
|  initial exchange between a pair of BGP speakers (P) is

|          BW = O((N + A) * P)
                         ^^^^                     ^^^^^

This makes no sense -- obviously you can't multiply by a non-numeric
quantity P, "a pair of BGP speakers".

I strongly suspect that it was the intention to say:

   Immediately after the initial BGP connection setup, BGP peers
   exchange complete sets of routing information.  If we denote the
   total number of routes in the Internet as N, the total path
   attributes (for all N routes) received from a peer as A, and assume
   that the networks are uniformly distributed among the autonomous
   systems, then the worst-case amount of bandwidth consumed during the
|  initial exchange between a pair of BGP speakers is

|          BW = O((N + A))

Please verify.


(5)  like (4)

Section 6.1.2, on page 8, exhibits similar symptoms as noted above.
The RFC says:

   To quantify the worst-case memory requirements for BGP, we denote the
   total number of networks in the Internet as N, the mean AS distance
   of the Internet as M (distance at the level of an autonomous system,
   expressed in terms of the number of autonomous systems), the total
   number of unique AS paths as A.  Then the worst-case memory
   requirements (MR) can be expressed as

           MR = O(N + (M * A))

   Because a mean AS distance M is a slow moving function of the
   interconnectivity ("meshiness") of the Internet, for all practical
   purposes the worst-case router memory requirements are on the order
|  of the total number of networks in the Internet multiplied by the
|  number of peers that the local system is peering with.  [...]

Apparently, the first part of that text has been revised eliminating
the role of the peering count.  Thus the last sentence should have
been updated accordingly, to make it match the new formula.

The second paragraph thus perhaps should say:

   Because a mean AS distance M is a slow moving function of the
   interconnectivity ("meshiness") of the Internet, for all practical
   purposes the worst-case router memory requirements are on the order
|  of the total number of networks in the Internet.  [...]


The final paragraph on page 8,

   The following table illustrates typical memory requirements of a
   router running BGP.  We denote the average number of routes
   advertised by each peer as N, the total number of unique AS paths as
   A, the mean AS distance of the Internet as M (distance at the level
   of an autonomous system, expressed in terms of the number of
   autonomous systems), the number of octets required to store a network
   as R, and the number of bytes required to store one AS in an AS path
|  as P.  It is assumed that each network is encoded as four bytes, each
   AS is encoded as two bytes, and each networks is reachable via some
|  fraction of all the peers (# BGP peers/per net).  For purposes of the
|  estimates here, we will calculate MR = (((N * R) + (M * A) * P) * S).
                                                             ^^^^ ^^^^

and the table on page 9,
                                       vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
|  # Networks  Mean AS Distance # ASes # BGP peers/per net   Memory Req
|      (N)             (M)        (A)          (P)              (MR)
   ----------  ---------------- ------ ------------------- -------------
     100,000           20         3,000         20           10,400,000
     100,000           20        15,000         20           20,000,000
     120,000           10        15,000        100           78,000,000
     140,000           15        20,000        100          116,000,000

exhibit additional issues:

- The text defines 'P' as
    "the number of bytes required to store one AS in an AS path"
  while apparently in the table (P) means
    "# BGP peers/per net".

- 'S' in the formula in the last line of page 9 is not defined
  anywhere in the text.

- "# BGP peers/per net" IMHO does not even make sense in the
  context of BGP, since BGP speakers represent ASes, not networks
  (prefixes).

I do not have a proposal for an easy way to get rid of these
inconsistencies.
Please check.


(6)  typos / grammar

In Section 10, the second paragraph on page 13 says:

|  BGP uses TCP MD5 option for validating data and protecting against
   spoofing of TCP segments exchanged between its sessions.  The usage
   of TCP MD5 option for BGP is described at length in [RFC2385].  The
   TCP MD5 Key management is discussed in [RFC3562].  BGP data
|  encryption is provided using the IPsec mechanism, which encrypts the
|  IP payload data (including TCP and BGP data).  The IPsec mechanism
|  can be used in both the transport mode and the tunnel mode.  The
|  IPsec mechanism is described in [RFC2406].  Both the TCP MD5 option
|  and the IPsec mechanism are not widely deployed security mechanisms
   for BGP in today's Internet.  Hence, it is difficult to gauge their
|  real performance impact when using with BGP.  However, because both
|  the mechanisms are TCP- and IP-based security mechanisms, the Link
   Bandwidth, CPU utilization and router memory consumed by BGP would be
|  the same as any other TCP- and IP-based protocols.

It should say, correcting grammar and unclear semantics:

|  BGP uses the TCP MD5 option for validating data and protecting
   against spoofing of TCP segments exchanged between its sessions.  The
   usage of TCP MD5 option for BGP is described at length in [RFC2385].
   The TCP MD5 Key management is discussed in [RFC3562].  BGP data
|  encryption is provided using the IPsec ESP mechanism, which encrypts
|  the IP payload data (including TCP and BGP data).  The IPsec ESP
|  mechanism can be used in both transport mode and tunnel mode.  The
|  IPsec ESP mechanism is described in [RFC2406].  Both the TCP MD5
|  option and IPsec ESP are not widely deployed security mechanisms
   for BGP in today's Internet.  Hence, it is difficult to gauge their
|  real performance impact when used with BGP.  However, because both
|  mechanisms are TCP- and IP-based security mechanisms, the Link
   Bandwidth, CPU utilization and router memory consumed by BGP would be
   the same as any for other TCP- and IP-based protocols.

(I am in doubt whether the last sentence is appropriate;
 at least, "the same as" should better be replaced by "similar as".
 Preferrably, I would delete that sentence.)

Finally, the 4th paragraph on page 13,
                                                      v
|  Such flexible TCP- and IP-based security mechanisms, allow BGP to
   prevent insertion/deletion/modification of BGP data, any snooping of
   the data, session stealing, etc.  [...]

should say:

|  Such flexible TCP- and IP-based security mechanisms allow BGP to
   prevent insertion/deletion/modification of BGP data, any snooping of
   the data, session stealing, etc.  [...]


(7)  some Ref's inappropriately named Normative

The References "[BGP-VULN]" and "[SBGP]" do not fulfill the
criteria for being used as Normative References.
Their inclusion in Section 11.1, on page 14, might formally be
seen as inhibiting the progress of BGP-4 on the Standards Track.


Please comment.

Most items seem to be appropriate for an Errata Note, but some
need your active cooperation to provide proper replacement text.

Preferrably, you should submit an Author's Errata Note to the
RFC Editor's RFC Errata web pages, making freely use of the
material supplied above.  But if you like, I can formally
submit an Errata Note on my own, with your consent, and with
additional text supplied by you -- or just for the 'easy' issues.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
in January, the new BGP-4 RFCs have been published.
Unfortunately, I did not find the time to report the
textual issues I found in these documents until now.

This message addresses RFC 4271 (BGP-4 Protocol) authored/edited
by you, pointing out some issues I found with the RFC text, and
supplying material for an appropriate RFC Errata Note.
(Almost all issues are strictly textual / editorial in nature.)

I apologize for never having found the time to comment on
RFC 1771, the origin of many of the issues, and for not being
aware of the update in progress for the BGP documentation.

The items below are presented in RFC textual order.
Recurring issues regularly are listed only once, for the first
occurrence, unless the circumstances justified a repetition.

I use change bars ('|' in column 1) and occasionally
up/down pointing marker lines ('^^^'/'vvv') to emphasize
the location of textual issues and/or proposed corrections.
Modified text has been re-adjusted to match RFC formatting
rules, where appropriate.


(1)  "ruler line" alignment

The "ruler lines" on top of many data layout figures are misaligned
by one column, compared to the standard placement introduced by
RFC 791, recommended by RFC 1122 and repeated in the latest
"Instructions to RFC Authors".

In Section 4.1 of RFC 4271, on page 12, the figure heading,

|     0                   1                   2                   3
|     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                                                               |
      [...]

should be adjusted as:

|      0                   1                   2                   3
|      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                                                               |
      [...]

Other places, where a similar adjustment is needed:
  - Section 4.2, on page 13 and page 14 ;
  - Section 4.3, on page 16 ;
  - Section 4.5, on page 22 .


(2)  clarification

Section 4.3 of RFC 4271, on page 15/16 contains the text and figure:

      Withdrawn Routes:

         This is a variable-length field that contains a list of IP
         address prefixes for the routes that are being withdrawn from
         service.  Each IP address prefix is encoded as a 2-tuple of the
         form <length, prefix>, whose fields are described below:

                  +---------------------------+
                  |   Length (1 octet)        |
                  +---------------------------+
                  |   Prefix (variable)       |
                  +---------------------------+

<< page break >>

         The use and the meaning of these fields are as follows:

         a) Length:

            The Length field indicates the length in bits of the IP
            address prefix.  A length of zero indicates a prefix that
            matches all IP addresses (with prefix, itself, of zero
            octets).

To avoid the overloading of the frequently used word "length"
and make the terminology unambiguous, I recommend to rename the
"Length" field to "PrefixLength".
Thus, the above snippit should be changed to say:

      Withdrawn Routes:

         This is a variable-length field that contains a list of IP
         address prefixes for the routes that are being withdrawn from
         service.  Each IP address prefix is encoded as a 2-tuple of the
         form <length, prefix>, whose fields are described below:

                  +---------------------------+
|                 |   PrefixLength (1 octet)  |
                  +---------------------------+
                  |   Prefix (variable)       |
                  +---------------------------+

<< page break >>

         The use and the meaning of these fields are as follows:

|        a) PrefixLength:

|           The PrefixLength field indicates the length in bits of the
            IP address prefix.  A length of zero indicates a prefix that
            matches all IP addresses (with prefix, itself, of zero
            octets).


(3)  typo

The last paragraph on page 17 (part of Section 4.3) says:

         If the Extended Length bit of the Attribute Flags octet is set
|        to 1, the third and fourth octets of the path attribute contain
         the length of the attribute data in octets.

It should say:

         If the Extended Length bit of the Attribute Flags octet is set
|        to 1, the third and fourth octet of the path attribute contain
         the length of the attribute data in octets.


(4)  outdated specification -- deprecation needed

Text in Section 4.3, on page 18, refers to the Historic EGP:

         a) ORIGIN (Type Code 1):

               [...]

               1         EGP - Network Layer Reachability Information
                            learned via the EGP protocol [RFC904]

Perhaps, this ORIGIN value should be deprecated:

         a) ORIGIN (Type Code 1):

               [...]

               1         EGP - Network Layer Reachability Information
                            learned via the EGP protocol [RFC904]
|                           (deprecated)


(5)  clarification

The text in the lower half of page 18 repeatedly talks about
a "1-octet length field" or a "2-octet length field".
This can be misunderstood -- not all of thes fields are length
fields.
According to the maxim of using simple wording in RFC text,
the word "length" should be omitted in such context.

Therefore, in the sub-section titled

         b) AS_PATH (Type Code 2):

a) modify:

|           The path segment type is a 1-octet length field with the
            following values defined:

to say:

|           The path segment type is a 1-octet field with the following
            values defined:

b) modify:

|           The path segment length is a 1-octet length field,
            containing the number of ASes (not the number of octets) in
            the path segment value field.

            The path segment value field contains one or more AS
|           numbers, each encoded as a 2-octet length field.

to say:

|           The path segment length is a 1-octet field, containing
            the number of ASes (not the number of octets) in the path
            segment value field.

            The path segment value field contains one or more AS
|           numbers, each encoded as a 2-octet field.


(6)  clarification -- similar to (2) above

Still within Section 4.3, on page 20, the

      Network Layer Reachability Information:

contains the figure and text:

         Reachability information is encoded as one or more 2-tuples of
         the form <length, prefix>, whose fields are described below:

                  +---------------------------+
                  |   Length (1 octet)        |
                  +---------------------------+
                  |   Prefix (variable)       |
                  +---------------------------+

         The use and the meaning of these fields are as follows:

         a) Length:

            The Length field indicates the length in bits of the IP
            address prefix.  A length of zero indicates a prefix that
            matches all IP addresses (with prefix, itself, of zero
            octets).

To avoid the overloading of the frequently used word "length"
and make the terminology unambiguous, again, I recommend to rename
the "Length" field to "PrefixLength".
Thus, the above snippit should be changed to say:

         Reachability information is encoded as one or more 2-tuples of
         the form <length, prefix>, whose fields are described below:

                  +---------------------------+
|                 |   PrefixLength (1 octet)  |
                  +---------------------------+
                  |   Prefix (variable)       |
                  +---------------------------+

         The use and the meaning of these fields are as follows:

|        a) PrefixLength:

|           The PrefixLength field indicates the length in bits of the
            IP address prefix.  A length of zero indicates a prefix that
            matches all IP addresses (with prefix, itself, of zero
            octets).


(7)  clarification / improved wording

Section 5.1.2, on top of page 26, says:

         1) if the first path segment of the AS_PATH is of type
            AS_SEQUENCE, the local system prepends its own AS number as
            the last element of the sequence (put it in the leftmost
            position with respect to the position of octets in the
|           protocol message).  If the act of prepending will cause an
            overflow in the AS_PATH segment (i.e., more than 255 ASes),
            it SHOULD prepend a new segment of type AS_SEQUENCE and
|           prepend its own AS number to this new segment.

The second half of this bullet, in particular the use of "will" and
the second instance of "prepend", is misleading.
I recommend to improve the wording, to say instead:

         1) if the first path segment of the AS_PATH is of type
            AS_SEQUENCE, the local system prepends its own AS number as
            the last element of the sequence (put it in the leftmost
            position with respect to the position of octets in the
|           protocol message).  If the act of prepending would cause an
            overflow in the AS_PATH segment (i.e., more than 255 ASes),
            it SHOULD prepend a new segment of type AS_SEQUENCE and
|           place its own AS number into this new segment.


(8)  word twister

Section 5.1.3, near the top of page 28, says:

   Normally, the NEXT_HOP attribute is chosen such that the shortest
   available path will be taken.  A BGP speaker MUST be able to support
|  the disabling advertisement of third party NEXT_HOP attributes in
   order to handle imperfectly bridged media.

It should say:

   Normally, the NEXT_HOP attribute is chosen such that the shortest
   available path will be taken.  A BGP speaker MUST be able to support
|  disabling the advertisement of third party NEXT_HOP attributes in
   order to handle imperfectly bridged media.

Simpler, but equivalent wording would be:

   Normally, the NEXT_HOP attribute is chosen such that the shortest
|  available path will be taken.  A BGP speaker MUST be able to suppress
|  the advertisement of third party NEXT_HOP attributes in order to
   handle imperfectly bridged media.



(9)  replicated text, and punctuation

In Section 6 on page 30, the end of the third paragraph says:

                          [...].  Before the invalid routes are deleted
   from the system, it advertises, to its peers, either withdraws for
   the routes marked as invalid, or the new best routes before the
   invalid routes are deleted from the system.

It should say:

(10)  clarification / textual improvement

The first paragraph of Section 6.1, on page 31, says:

   All errors detected while processing the Message Header MUST be
   indicated by sending the NOTIFICATION message with the Error Code
   Message Header Error.  The Error Subcode elaborates on the specific
   nature of the error.

It should say:

   All errors detected while processing the Message Header MUST be
|  indicated by sending a NOTIFICATION message with Error Code
|  'Message Header Error'.  The Error Subcode elaborates on the specific
   nature of the error.

(I have added the [single] quotes to improve readability and clarity.
 You may drop this, if you dislike it.)


(11)  unexpected lack of precision

Later on on page 31, Section 6.1 says:

   If at least one of the following is true:

      - if the Length field of the message header is less than 19 or
        greater than 4096, or

      - if the Length field of an OPEN message is less than the minimum
        length of the OPEN message, or

      - if the Length field of an UPDATE message is less than the
        minimum length of the UPDATE message, or

      - if the Length field of a KEEPALIVE message is not equal to 19,
        or

      - if the Length field of a NOTIFICATION message is less than the
        minimum length of the NOTIFICATION message,

   then the Error Subcode MUST be set to Bad Message Length.  The Data
   field MUST contain the erroneous Length field.

IMHO, these specifications are unnecessarily imprecise in part;
all the concrete limit values should be specified here for clarity --
they certainly will not be changed any more in the future, for BGP-4.

(Additionally, the condition specified in the last bullet apparently
contradicts the specification in Section 6.4; that will be discussed
below -- see item (17).)

Therefore, the above snippit should better say:

   If at least one of the following is true:

      - if the Length field of the message header is less than 19 or
        greater than 4096, or

|     - if the Length field of an OPEN message is less than 29, the
        minimum length of the OPEN message, or

|     - if the Length field of an UPDATE message is less than 23, the
        minimum length of the UPDATE message, or

      - if the Length field of a KEEPALIVE message is not equal to 19,
        or

|     - if the Length field of a NOTIFICATION message is less than 21,
        the minimum length of the NOTIFICATION message,

   then the Error Subcode MUST be set to Bad Message Length.  The Data
   field MUST contain the erroneous Length field.

or even (much shorter):

   If at least one of the following is true:

      - if the Length field of the message header is less than 19 or
        greater than 4096, or

|     - if the Length field of an OPEN message is less than 29, or

|     - if the Length field of an UPDATE message is less than 23, or

      - if the Length field of a KEEPALIVE message is not equal to 19,
        or

|     - if the Length field of a NOTIFICATION message is less than 21,

   then the Error Subcode MUST be set to Bad Message Length.  The Data
   field MUST contain the erroneous Length field.

The third paragraph on page 33 (within Section 6.3) says:

|  If any of the well-known mandatory attributes are not recognized,
   then the Error Subcode MUST be set to Unrecognized Well-known
   Attribute.  The Data field MUST contain the unrecognized attribute
   (type, length, and value).

It should say:

   then the Error Subcode MUST be set to Unrecognized Well-known
   Attribute.  The Data field MUST contain the unrecognized attribute
   (type, length, and value).


(15)  clarifications and corrections

The 5th + ff. paragraphs on page 33 (within Section 6.3) say:

   If the NEXT_HOP attribute field is syntactically incorrect, then the
   Error Subcode MUST be set to Invalid NEXT_HOP Attribute.  The Data
   field MUST contain the incorrect attribute (type, length, and value).
   Syntactic correctness means that the NEXT_HOP attribute represents a
|  valid IP host address.

|  The IP address in the NEXT_HOP MUST meet the following criteria to be
   considered semantically correct:

|     a) It MUST NOT be the IP address of the receiving speaker.

This text should say:

   If the NEXT_HOP attribute field is syntactically incorrect, then the
   Error Subcode MUST be set to Invalid NEXT_HOP Attribute.  The Data
   field MUST contain the incorrect attribute (type, length, and value).
   Syntactic correctness means that the NEXT_HOP attribute represents a
|  valid (unicast) IP interface address.

|  The IP address in the NEXT_HOP attribute MUST meet the following
   criteria to be considered semantically correct:

|     a) It MUST NOT be an IP address of the receiving speaker.

(Restriction to *unicast* addresses seems essential; IP addresses
 are bound to *interfaces*; a host may have multiple IP addresses.)


(16)  suspected inconsistency

The first paragraph on page 34 (still within Section 6.3) says:

   If the UPDATE message is received from an external peer, the local
   system MAY check whether the leftmost (with respect to the position
   of octets in the protocol message) AS in the AS_PATH attribute is
   equal to the autonomous system number of the peer that sent the
   message.  If the check determines this is not the case, the Error
   Subcode MUST be set to Malformed AS_PATH.

This specification -- when taken literally -- contradicts the
optimization specified in Appendix F.4 !
To resolve this issue, perhaps the above check should only be
performed if the first path segment is an AS_SEQUENCE, and *not*
in the case of an AS_SET.

Please check!


(17)  suspected inconsistency

Section 6.4, on page 34, says:

|  If a peer sends a NOTIFICATION message, and the receiver of the
|  message detects an error in that message, the receiver cannot use a
|  NOTIFICATION message to report this error back to the peer.  Any such
   error (e.g., an unrecognized Error Code or Error Subcode) SHOULD be
   noticed, logged locally, and brought to the attention of the
   administration of the peer.  The means to do this, however, lies
   outside the scope of this document.

This specification apparently is in contradiction to Section 6.1,
where the last bullet (cf. item (11) above) triggers sending of an
error NOTIFICATION in response to a NOTIFICATION with illegal Length.

Please check!


(18)  clarification / textual improvement -- similar to (10) above

Section 6.5, on page 34, says:

   If a system does not receive successive KEEPALIVE, UPDATE, and/or

It should better say:

a) Section 6.7, on page 35, says:

   In the absence of any fatal errors (that are indicated in this
   section), a BGP peer MAY choose, at any given time, to close its BGP

   However, the Cease NOTIFICATION message MUST NOT be used when a fatal
   error indicated by this section does exist.

b) Later on on page 35, at the end of Section 6.7, the RFC says:

               [...].  If the BGP speaker decides to terminate its BGP
   connection with a neighbor because the number of address prefixes
   received from the neighbor exceeds the locally-configured, upper

(21)  improper wording

The first two paragraphs of Section 6.8, on page 35, say:

|  If a pair of BGP speakers try to establish a BGP connection with each
|  other simultaneously, then two parallel connections well be formed.
   If the source IP address used by one of these connections is the same
   as the destination IP address used by the other, and the destination
   IP address used by the first connection is the same as the source IP
   address used by the other, connection collision has occurred.  In the
   event of connection collision, one of the connections MUST be closed.

   Based on the value of the BGP Identifier, a convention is established
|  for detecting which BGP connection is to be preserved when a
   collision occurs.  [...]

The RFC text should say:

|  If a pair of BGP speakers tries to establish a BGP connection with
|  each other simultaneously, then two parallel connections will be
   formed.
   If the source IP address used by one of these connections is the same
   as the destination IP address used by the other, and the destination
   IP address used by the first connection is the same as the source IP
   address used by the other, connection collision has occurred.  In the
   event of connection collision, one of the connections MUST be closed.

   Based on the value of the BGP Identifier, a convention is established
|  for determining which BGP connection is to be preserved when a
   collision occurs.  [...]


(22)  unnecessarily complicated spec.

The first bullet on page 36 (within Section 6.8) says:

      1) The BGP Identifier of the local system is compared to the BGP
         Identifier of the remote system (as specified in the OPEN
         message).  Comparing BGP Identifiers is done by converting them
         to host byte order and treating them as 4-octet unsigned
         integers.

Since the BGP Identifier *is* defined as a 4-octet unsigned integer
(cf. page 5 of the RFC), the second sentence is redundant; it gives
trivial implementation details (partially inappropriate for platforms
operating intrinsically in network byte order) that should not be
part of a protocol specification.
(BTW, network byte order has the significant advantage that unsigned
 integers can always be compared as octect strings -- e.g. using POSIX
 strncmp() -- *without* any host dependant byte order conversion!)
Thus, preferrably that second sentence might better be deleted.


(23)  incomplete specification / clarification

The second and the third bullet on page 36 (within Section 6.8) say:

      2) If the value of the local BGP Identifier is less than the
         remote one, the local system closes the BGP connection that
         already exists (the one that is already in the OpenConfirm
|        state), and accepts the BGP connection initiated by the remote
         system.

      3) Otherwise, the local system closes the newly created BGP
         connection (the one associated with the newly received OPEN
         message), and continues to use the existing one (the one that
|        is already in the OpenConfirm state).

This text does not fully reflect the preceding explanations (on p. 35)
and also should be clarified a bit to more precisely name the subject
connection.
Thus, the RFC should better say:

      2) If the value of the local BGP Identifier is less than the
         remote one, the local system closes the BGP connection that
|        already exists (the one that is already in the OpenConfirm [or
|        OpenSent] state), and accepts the new BGP connection initiated
         by the remote system.
                                          ^^^^^

The final paragraphh of Section 6.8, on page 36, says:

   Closing the BGP connection (that results from the collision
|  resolution procedure) is accomplished by sending the NOTIFICATION

It should say:

   Closing the BGP connection (that results from the collision

|  message with Error Code 'Cease'.


(25)  apparently redundant variable in the BGP-4 FSM

Section 8, on page 37, lists as a required session attribute:

      2) ConnectRetryCounter

and says (on mid-page 37):

   ....  The ConnectRetryCounter indicates the number of times a BGP
   peer has tried to establish a peer session.

Later on in the RFC (i.e. throughout the whole Section 8, on pages
53 to 75), there are only two different actions specified that
operate on the ConnectRetryCounter:

    - set to zero,
and
    - increments by 1.

But, surprisingly, the value of that counter is *never* read or
tested in this specification.
In particular, this counter value is not mentioned in the context
of peer oscillation damping, where it might be expected.
I also could not locate in any other RFC the (abbreviated) term,
"ConnectRetryCount" -- even with embedded white space.

Therefore, the above sentence on mid-page 37 needs to be amended,
telling the intended use of the ConnectRetryCounter.

Please check.

|       - sets ConnectRetryCounter to zero,

        - starts the ConnectRetryTimer with the initial value,

|       - initiates a TCP connection to the other BGP peer,

The wording of this text needs to be corrected, and made consistent
with the wording used in other parts of Section 8.

(29)  word omission

Section 8.2.2, on page 54, says:

(30)  word omission

Section 8.2.2, in the first line of page 55, says:

(31)  expected operation not specified

Section 8.2.2, in line 5..8 of page 55, specifies:

      In response to the ConnectRetryTimer_Expires event (Event 9), the
      local system:

        - drops the TCP connection,

        - restarts the ConnectRetryTimer,

        [...]

>From the context, it might perhaps be expected that in this case
additionally the ConnectRetryCounter should be incremented by one.
This is not specified here.  Shouldn't it?
But also cf. (25) above !!

A similar issue arises repeatedly in the remainder of section 8.2.2,
whenever a restart of the ConnectRetryTimer is specified.


(32)  textual improvement

Section 8.2.2, in line 10 of page 55, says:

|       - initiates a TCP connection to the other BGP peer,

As in (28) above, it should say:

(33)  suspected improper specification

Later on onpage 55, Section 8.2.2 says:

      If the BGP FSM receives a TcpConnection_Valid event (Event 14),
      the TCP connection is processed, and the connection remains in the
      Connect state.

I strongly suspect that, according to the explanations given
in Section 8.2.1.2, Event 14 will not "happen" in the BGP FSM
in the Connect state, but instead in another, second BGP FSM.
If this is true, the above sentence should perhaps be deleted.

Please check.


(34)  incomplete specification

Near the bottom of page 56, Section 8.2.2 says:

      If an OPEN message is received while the DelayOpenTimer is running

In accordance with the text style in other parts of Section 8,
it should give a more complete specification for this case,

      If an OPEN message is received while the DelayOpenTimer is running
|     (Event 20), all fields are checked for correctness. If there are
|     no errors in the OPEN message, the local system:


(35)  intended purpose unclear

Section 8.2.2, near the bottom of page 57, specifies:

|       - increments the ConnectRetryCounter by 1,

        - performs peer oscillation damping if the DampPeerOscillations
          attribute is set to True, and

|       - changes its state to Idle.

According to the text on page 53, in the Idle state no resources
are allocated to the peer, i.e. there is no actual instantiation
of the FSM with its attributes.  But the ConnectRetryCounter is
one of these attributes (cf. page 37).  According to item (25),
the value of ConnectRetryCounter is not used anywhere, and it
hence apparently makes no sense to increment it just before
deleting the FSM instance.

This issue recurs repeatedly in the remainder of Section 8.2.2.


(36)  word omission

Section 8.2.2, in line 2+3 of page 59, says:

(37)  word omission -- like (30)

Section 8.2.2, in line 12 on page 55, says:

|       - sets ConnectRetryCounter to zero,

To make the wording consistent with other parts of Section 8,
it should say:

|       - sets the ConnectRetryCounter to zero,
              ^^^^^

(38)  clarification / textual improvement

Section 8.2.2, in mid-page 59 says:

      In response to a ConnectRetryTimer_Expires event (Event 9), the
      local system:

        - restarts the ConnectRetryTimer (with initial value),

|       - initiates a TCP connection to the other BGP peer,

For the first bullet, see (31) above.
As in the last part of (28) above, the second bullet should say:

|       - initiates a TCP connection to the BGP peer,


(39)  typo

In the final line at the bottom of page 59, Section 8.2.2 says:

|       - sends the OPEN message to its remote peer,

It should say:

|       - sends an OPEN message to its remote peer,
               ^^^^

(40)  textual improvement

Section 8.2.2, in line 3/4 of page 60 says:
                                       vvvvvv
|     A HoldTimer value of 4 minutes is also suggested for this state
      transition.

It should say:

|     A HoldTimer value of 4 minutes is suggested for this state
      transition.


(41)  suspect specification

In the final line at the bottom of page 60, Section 8.2.2 specifys:

        - restarts the ConnectRetryTimer (with the initial value),

Subsequently, the state is changed to Idle (page 61).
In Idle state, the BGP FSM is not actually instantiated
and hence cannot handle timer expiry ( event 9).
Thus, this specufucation apparently does not make sense.

Please check.


(42)  bad wording

At mid-page 61, Section 8.2.2 syas:

        - if the HoldTimer value is non-zero,

|           - starts the KeepaliveTimer to initial value,
                                       ^^^^
It should perhaps say:

        - if the HoldTimer value is non-zero,

|           - starts the KeepaliveTimer with its initial value,


(43)  word omission

On page 63, Section 8.2.2 says:

   OpenSent:

      In this state, BGP FSM waits for an OPEN message from its peer.

It should say:

   OpenSent:

      In this state, the BGP FSM waits for an OPEN message from its
      peer.


(44)  textual improvement

At mid-page 63, Section 8.2.2 says:

        - sends the NOTIFICATION with a Cease,

It should better say:

        - sends a NOTIFICATION with Error Code 'Cease',

This issue recurs near the bottom of page 63, and -- including
slight variants -- 8 more times later on in the text.


(45)  misleading wording

Section 8.2.2, in line 7 on page 65, says:

|       - sets a KeepaliveTimer (via the text below)
              ^^^
It should say:

|       - sets the KeepaliveTimer (via the text below)

(There's only one such timer in the BGP FSM instance.)


(46)  textual improvement

Section 8.2.2, 6 lines from the bottom of page 66, says:

|       - sends the NOTIFICATION with the Error Code Finite State
          Machine Error,

It should say:

|       - sends a NOTIFICATION with Error Code 'Finite State Machine
|         Error',


(47)  textual improvement

Section 8.2.2, at the top of page 68, says:

|       - sends the NOTIFICATION message with the Error Code Hold Timer
          Expired,

It should say:

|       - sends a NOTIFICATION message with Error Code 'Hold Timer
          Expired',


(48)  word omission

Section 8.2.2, at mid-page 68, says:

      In the event of a TcpConnection_Valid event (Event 14), or the
      success of a TCP connection (Event 16 or Event 17) while in
|     OpenConfirm, the local system needs to track the second
      connection.

It should say:

      In the event of a TcpConnection_Valid event (Event 14), or the
      success of a TCP connection (Event 16 or Event 17) while in
|     OpenConfirm state, the local system needs to track the second
      connection.


(49)  improper sequence of specification

Section 8.2.2, on page 69/70, contains two blocks of bulleted items
the preconditions of which must be tested in reverse order for
obtaining logically correct behaviour.
Hence, the text block on page 69,

      If the local system receives a valid OPEN message (BGPOpen (Event
      19)), the collision detect function is processed per Section 6.8.
      If this connection is to be dropped due to connection collision,
      the local system:

        - sends a NOTIFICATION with a Cease,

        - sets the ConnectRetryTimer to zero,

        - releases all BGP resources,

        - drops the TCP connection (send TCP FIN),

        - increments the ConnectRetryCounter by 1,

        - (optionally) performs peer oscillation damping if the
          DampPeerOscillations attribute is set to TRUE, and

        - changes its state to Idle.

should be moved behind the immediately subsequent text block
(extending from page 69 to page 70):

      If an OPEN message is received, all fields are checked for
      correctness.  If the BGP message header checking (BGPHeaderErr
      (Event 21)) or OPEN message checking detects an error (see Section
      6.2) (BGPOpenMsgErr (Event 22)), the local system:

        - sends a NOTIFICATION message with the appropriate error code,

        - sets the ConnectRetryTimer to zero,

        - releases all BGP resources,

        - drops the TCP connection,

        - increments the ConnectRetryCounter by 1,

<< page break >>

        - (optionally) performs peer oscillation damping if the
          DampPeerOscillations attribute is set to TRUE, and

        - changes its state to Idle.

(Additionally, various notes from above apply.)


(50)  unclear specification

Following the two text blocks shown in item (49) above,
Section 8.2.2, on page 70, says:

      If, during the processing of another OPEN message, the BGP
      implementation determines, by a means outside the scope of this
      document, that a connection collision has occurred and this
      connection is to be closed, the local system will issue an
      OpenCollisionDump event (Event 23).  [...]

Apparently, this text is inappropriate, since the RFC indeed does
contain specification text detailing collision detection and
resolution, i.e. determining which connection is to be closed.


(51)  indentation flaw

Section 8.2.2, at mid-page 71, says:

        - sets the ConnectRetryCounter to zero, and

|        - changes its state to Idle.
        ^^
It should say:

        - sets the ConnectRetryCounter to zero, and

|       - changes its state to Idle.


(52)  textual improvement, and punctuation

Immediately below the text mentioned in item (51) above,
Section 8.2.2 says:

      In response to an AutomaticStop event (Event 8), the local system:

|       - sends a NOTIFICATION with a Cease,

|       - sets the ConnectRetryTimer to zero

        - deletes all routes associated with this connection,

Incorporation arguments from above,
it should say:

      In response to an AutomaticStop event (Event 8), the local system:

|       - sends a NOTIFICATION with Error Code 'Cease',

|       - sets the ConnectRetryTimer to zero,

        - deletes all routes associated with this connection,


(53)  event logic

On mid-page 72, Section 8.2.2 says:

      If the KeepaliveTimer_Expires event occurs (Event 11), the local
      system:

        - sends a KEEPALIVE message, and

|       - restarts its KeepaliveTimer, unless the negotiated HoldTime
|         value is zero.

As far as I can see, in this case the latter condition is
precluded by the established dependencies.
Hence, teh RFC should say:

      If the KeepaliveTimer_Expires event occurs (Event 11), the local
      system:

        - sends a KEEPALIVE message, and

|       - restarts its KeepaliveTimer.


(54)  typo

The second paragraph of Section 9.1.1, on page 77, says:

|  The Phase 1 decision function is a separate process,f which completes
   when it has no further work to do.
                                                       ^^
It should say:

|  The Phase 1 decision function is a separate process, which completes
   when it has no further work to do.


(55)  textual improvement

At the end of Section 9.1.1, on page 77, RFC 4271 says:

      If the route is learned from an external peer, then the local BGP
      speaker computes the degree of preference based on preconfigured
      policy information.  If the return value indicates the route is
      ineligible, the route MAY NOT serve as an input to the next phase
      of route selection; otherwise, the return value MUST be used as
      the LOCAL_PREF value in any IBGP readvertisement.

      The exact nature of this policy information, and the computation
      involved, is a local matter.

The sequence of sentences should be reordered to make it more logical,
and the indentation level adjusted to mirror the role of the sentences
(relative to the preceding text).
Thus, the RFC should say:

      If the route is learned from an external peer, then the local BGP
      speaker computes the degree of preference based on preconfigured
      policy information.  The exact nature of this policy information,
      and the computation involved, is a local matter.

   If the return value indicates the route is ineligible, the route
   MAY NOT serve as an input to the next phase of route selection;
   otherwise, the return value MUST be used as the LOCAL_PREF value
   in any IBGP readvertisement.


(56)  missing forward reference

In Section 9.1.2, the second paragraph on page 78,

   If the NEXT_HOP attribute of a BGP route depicts an address that is
   not resolvable, or if it would become unresolvable if the route was
   installed in the routing table, the BGP route MUST be excluded from
   the Phase 2 decision function.

makes use of the terms "resolvable" vc. "unresolvable" not yet
introduced into the text until that place.
Perhaps, a forward reference should be added to resolve this issue.
Thus, the text should better say:

   If the NEXT_HOP attribute of a BGP route depicts an address that is
   not resolvable, or if it would become unresolvable if the route was
   installed in the routing table, the BGP route MUST be excluded from
|  the Phase 2 decision function (see Section 9.1.2.1 for details).


(57)  pseudocode issue, 1st instance

The pseudocode in Section 9.1.2.2 c), on page 81:

       for m = all routes still under consideration
|          for n = all routes still under consideration
               if (neighborAS(m) == neighborAS(n)) and (MED(n) < MED(m))
                   remove route m from consideration

erroneously admits the reflexive case (n = m) for the inner loop,
which should be excluded.
Therefore, the RFC should say:

       for m = all routes still under consideration
|          for n = all other routes still under consideration
               if (neighborAS(m) == neighborAS(n)) and (MED(n) < MED(m))
                   remove route m from consideration


(58)  pseudocode issue, 2nd instance

A similar issue as the one noted in item (57) above also holds for
Section 9.1.2.2 e), where the text on page 82 says:

         for m = all routes still under consideration
|            for n = all routes in still under consideration
                 if (cost(n) is lower than cost(m))
                     remove m from consideration

where it should say:

         for m = all routes still under consideration
|            for n = all other routes in still under consideration
                 if (cost(n) is lower than cost(m))
                     remove m from consideration


(59)  typo

The 3rd paragraph of section 9.2.1.1, on page 85, says:

   Since fast convergence is needed within an autonomous system, either
   (a) the MinRouteAdvertisementIntervalTimer used for internal peers
   SHOULD be shorter than the MinRouteAdvertisementIntervalTimer used
|  for external peers, or (b) the procedure describe in this section
   SHOULD NOT apply to routes sent to internal peers.

It should say:

   Since fast convergence is needed within an autonomous system, either
   (a) the MinRouteAdvertisementIntervalTimer used for internal peers
   SHOULD be shorter than the MinRouteAdvertisementIntervalTimer used
|  for external peers, or (b) the procedure described in this section
   SHOULD NOT apply to routes sent to internal peers.


(60)  misleading text (?) / clarification

I strongly suspect that the final sentence in Section 9.2.2.1,
on page 86,

                [...].  In practice, this is not likely to be a problem
         because once an IP packet arrives at the edge of a group of
         autonomous systems, the BGP speaker is likely to have more
         detailed path information and can distinguish individual paths
|        from destinations.

in fact should say:

                [...].  In practice, this is not likely to be a problem
         because once an IP packet arrives at the edge of a group of
         autonomous systems, the BGP speaker is likely to have more
         detailed path information and can distinguish individual paths
|        to different destinations (that it had aggregated).


(61)  missing words, punctuation, and textual enhancements

In Section 9.2.2.2, on page 87, the rule that says:

      ORIGIN attribute:
|        If at least one route among routes that are aggregated has
         ORIGIN with the value INCOMPLETE, then the aggregated route
|        MUST have the ORIGIN attribute with the value INCOMPLETE.
|        Otherwise, if at least one route among routes that are
         aggregated has ORIGIN with the value EGP, then the aggregated
         route MUST have the ORIGIN attribute with the value EGP.  In
|        all other cases,, the value of the ORIGIN attribute of the
         aggregated route is IGP.

should better say:

      ORIGIN attribute:
|        If at least one route among the routes that are aggregated has
         ORIGIN with the value INCOMPLETE, then the aggregated route
|        MUST have INCOMPLETE as its ORIGIN attribute value.
|        Otherwise, if at least one route among the routes that are
         aggregated has ORIGIN with the value EGP, then the aggregated
         route MUST have the ORIGIN attribute with the value EGP.  In
|        all other cases, the value of the ORIGIN attribute of the
         aggregated route is IGP.


(62)  textual improvement / clarification

The second paragraph of Section 10, on page 90, says:

   Two optional timers MAY be supported: DelayOpenTimer, IdleHoldTimer
   by BGP (see Section 8).  Section 8 describes their use.  The full
   operation of these optional timers is outside the scope of this
   document.

It should better say:

|  Two optional timers MAY be supported by BGP (see Section 8):
|  DelayOpenTimer and IdleHoldTimer.  Section 8 describes their use.
   The full operation of these optional timers is outside the scope of
   this document.


(63)  word omission

In Appendix A, the last line on page 92,

|     Clarification of BGP FSM.

should say:

|     Clarification of the BGP FSM.


(64)  outdated wording

In Appendix B, the sentence at the end of the 2nd paragraph on page 93,

                                                   [...].  These
|  abilities allow BGP-4 to support the proposed supernetting scheme
   [RFC1518, RFC1519].
                                       ^^^^^^^^^^
uses oudated wording.  This might easily be corrected.
The text should say:
                                       vvvvvv
                                                   [...].  These
|  abilities allow BGP-4 to support the CIDR supernetting scheme
   [RFC1518, RFC1519].


(65)  completeness, and improved wording

The final paragraph of Appendix D, on page 94,

   Note that quite often BGP, as specified in RFC 1105, is referred to
   as BGP-1; BGP, as specified in [RFC1163], is referred to as BGP-2;
|  BGP, as specified in RFC 1267 is referred to as BGP-3; and BGP, as
|  specified in this document is referred to as BGP-4.

should be enhanced and corrected to say:

   Note that quite often BGP, as specified in RFC 1105, is referred to
   as BGP-1; BGP, as specified in [RFC1163], is referred to as BGP-2;
|  BGP, as specified in [RFC1267] is referred to as BGP-3; and BGP, as
|  specified in [RFC1771] and this document is referred to as BGP-4.
                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


(66)  word omission

The first paragraph of Appendix E, on page 94,

   If a local system TCP user interface supports the TCP PUSH function,
   then each BGP message SHOULD be transmitted with PUSH flag set.
|  Setting PUSH flag forces BGP messages to be transmitted to the
   receiver promptly.

should say:

   If a local system TCP user interface supports the TCP PUSH function,
   then each BGP message SHOULD be transmitted with PUSH flag set.
|  Setting the PUSH flag forces BGP messages to be transmitted to the
   receiver promptly.


(67)  specification conflict

As noted in item (16) above, the optimization specified
in Appendix F.4, on page 96, conflicts with text in Section 6.3,
on page 34, if the latter is taken literally.


(68)  outdated Ref.

Within the Security Considerations (which are, unfortunately,
an unnumbered section!), the 4th paragraph on page 98 says:

   Obviously, each should key also be chosen to be difficult for an
|  attacker to guess.  The techniques specified in RFC 1750 for random
   number generation provide a guide for generation of values that could
   be used as keys.  [...]

Long before RFC 4271, RFC 4086 = BCP 106 has been published, which
obsoleted RFC 1750.  Therefore, RFC 4271 should reference RFC 4086
in the text above, and an appropriate Reference (Informative, or even
Normative) should be added on page 101/102.
The above text should say:

   Obviously, each should key also be chosen to be difficult for an
|  attacker to guess.  The techniques specified in [RFC4086] for random
   number generation provide a guide for generation of values that could
   be used as keys.  [...]


(69)  incomplete IANA Considerations

Within the IANA Considerations (which are, unfortunately, an
unnumbered section!), I miss the listing of, and maintenance
guidance for, the BGP-4 Open Message Attribute Types sub-registry.


This concludes my notes on RFC 4271.
(The list has grown to an unexpected size, during elaboration!)

Please comment.

A lot of the items above seem to be appropriate for an Errata Note.

Preferrably, you should submit an Author's Errata Note to the
RFC Editor's RFC Errata web pages, making freely use of the
material supplied above.  But if you like, I can formally
submit an Errata Note on my own, with your advice and consent.

The remainder of the notes above should be kept in mind for use
in a future update of the document, for advancement of BGP-4 to
Full Standard.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Alfred,

Thanks for your message.

First, your errata wrt. typos/missing/extraneous words appears
to me to be correct.  However, I'm not sure that any of them will
cause any confusion to a reader, and thus I'm not sure that that they,
by themselves, justify the generation of an RFC Errata.

Second, wrt. Counter32's, ...

No.

a) It is not necessary for this DESCRIPTION to specify that the
object's value can wrap from 2^32-1 to 0 -- that is required behaviour
for any object with Counter32 as its SYNTAX, as specified by section
7.1.6 of RFC 2578, which is referenced by section 1 of this RFC.

b) It would be tediously repetitive if every MIB object which has
Counter32 as its syntax had to repeat the whole definition of a
Counter32 in its DESCRIPTION.  The reason why we have Counter32 as a
syntax is to avoid such tedious repetition.  Further, the whole concept
of Textual Conventions is based on including syntax and semantics
via the SYNTAX clause, without having to repeat it.

Instead, the DESCRIPTION needs to focus on what is unique about this
MIB object's behaviour as compared to other Counter32 objects.

c) Regarding this text:

        Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-
        initialization of the management system."

Further, section 7.1.6 of RFC 2578 also says:
                                             ...  Discontinuities
   in the monotonically increasing value normally occur at re-
   initialization of the management system, and at other times as
   specified in the description of an object-type using this ASN.1 type.

so one can argue that this text:

        Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-
        initialization of the management system."

is also rendundant.  However, since RFC 2578 uses the word "normally",
having this sentence here emphasizes that this object has the "normal"
behaviour.

d) The 'discontinuity time stamp' for re-initialization of the management
system is sysUpTime.  Section 7.1.6 of RFC 2578 continues from the above
quote as follows:

   If such other times can occur, for example, the creation of an object
   instance at times other than re-initialization, then a corresponding
   object should be defined, with an appropriate SYNTAX clause, to
   indicate the last discontinuity. 

So, since no "such other times" have been identified, there is no need
to define an additional 'discontinuity time stamp' object.

No.  Table row creation causes a disontinuity in the value of the table.
Thus, the "Last Creation" time is required (see above quotes from RFC 2578)
as a discontinuity timestamp.

There are two issues here:

1) a typo in the ASN.1 comments.  The correct OID is { scsiMIB 0 } because
that's what the MIB compiler will process, i.e., the MIB compiler will
not process the ASN.1 comment.  It is not too late to correct the typo
in the ASN.1 comment.

2) In the development of the MIB, the change to use the OID structure
recommended by Appendix D of RFC 4181 caused the use of
scsiNotificationsPrefix (as the means to include zero in the OIDs of
the notifications) to become no longer necessary, and it would have
been better if it had been removed.  But, it is now too late to remove
scsiNotificationsPrefix.

I think the only one of your corrections which is needed to avoid the
possibility of causing confusion to a reader is the one regarding the
OID of scsiNotifications.  If an RFC Errata Note is created because
of that one, and all the other typos that you have found are also
included in the same RFC Errata Note, then my fear is that the one
which could be important will get buried in the triviality of the
others.  Thus, I suggest that an RFC Errata Note, if created, should
only mention the OID of scsiNotifications.

I don't believe there are any items which need to be considered by the
WG for a future update to the MIB module.

Keith.

If this MIB had not yet been published as an RFC, I would make the
change you suggest.  However, a) both paragraphs were correct at the
times they were written, and b) both paragraphs will be out-of-date
as and when FC-SW-5 becomes the current standard.  Thus, I don't
think it is necessary to generate an RFC Errata Note which is
scheduled to itself become out-of-date in 18 months.

Actually, I think it was intended to be:

          When all bits are set to 0, it indicates that no class of
          service is supported by this Nx_Port.

Yes, but the meaning is clear even though there is a grammatical error.

My co-authors and I have no control over the content of the boilerplate.
Please take up this point with the IETF AD for Network Management.

I believe the only above item for which the benefit of an RFC Errata is
worth the cost, is for your item #2 above.  I think the appropriate
action on my part is to submit the correction to the IETF WG first, and
if there are no objections, then to submit it as an RFC Errata.

Alfred,

Thanks for your message.  Two of your suggested changes are
inappropriate:

No.  The REFERENCE clause refers to FC-FS, section 15.6.2.4.2 which says:

                              ...  If this bit is set to zero, the
      assigned address may or may not have been used by a previous
      device within R_A_TOV.

Thus, an Address Identifier can be unassigned and currently available
even though it's 'Clean Address' bit is set to 0.

This text was required to be added by the MIB Doctor review, based
on the last paragraph on page 20 of RFC 4181.

The other changes you suggested are typos which, even though your
suggestions would be a grammatical improvement, there is no danger
of any reader being confused by them.  Thus, I do not think that
the cost of having an RFC Errata is justified for this document.

==========================
Per RFC4249 sec 3.2.2:

Some fields are mandatory, others are optional.  It may make sense to 
permit multiple instances of a field in a given header; in other cases, 
at most a single instance is sensible.  RFC2822 specifies a minimum and 
maximum count per header for each standard field in a message; 
specification authors should likewise specify minimum and maximum counts 
for extension fields.
==========================

I would like to see RFC1049 expanded to specifically state that only a 
single Content-Type header field is legal.

I've been triaging bugs for the Mozilla project's mail clients, and one 
of these bug reports complains about Mozilla's display of certain 
messages from eBay.  The message format from these messages includes two 
Content-Type headers, the first being a wholly proprietary one on eBay's 
part.

See: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=338675>

While Mozilla probably could have a more intelligent handling of the 
multiple-header case, it would be useful to be able to point to an RFC 
when trying to convince eBay to stop generating messages with this 
silliness.  (One user who has been in contact with eBay states that 
eBay's response is essentially: Microsoft's client displays messages 
correctly, so we don't need to change.)

Thanks for your attention.

Hello,
reading the recently published RFC 4612 (audio/t38 media type
registration) authored by you, I found a few issues that should
be addressed by an RFC Errata Note, and issue (1) below should
also be corrected in the corresponding IANA Registration file.


(1)  [line folding issue]

Within the Media Type Registration for subtype 'audio/t38',
RFC 4612 (near the top of page 5) says:

   Additional information:

      Magic number(s):  File extension(s):  Macintosh File Type Code(s):

It should say:

   Additional information:

      Magic number(s):
      File extension(s):
      Macintosh File Type Code(s):


(2)  [line folding issue]

Within Section 5, RFC 4612 (at the bottom of page 5) says:

   Consider the following example, which describes a media stream that
   allows the transport of G.711 audio and T.38 fax information:

   m=audio 6800 RTP/AVP 0 98 a=rtpmap:98 t38/8000 a=fmtp:98
   T38FaxVersion=2;T38FaxRateManagement=transferredTCF

It should say:

   Consider the following example, which describes a media stream that
   allows the transport of G.711 audio and T.38 fax information:

      m=audio 6800 RTP/AVP 0 98
      a=rtpmap:98 t38/8000
      a=fmtp:98 T38FaxVersion=2;T38FaxRateManagement=transferredTCF


(3)  [outdated Ref.]

In Section 7 (on page 6 of RFC 4612), item [2] refers to RFC 2327.
That RFC had been obsoleted by RFC 4566 at the time of publication
of RFC 4612 (RFC 4566 had been published 3 weeks before RFC 4612).

Therefore, item [2] should have been replaced by the appropriate
citation for RFC 4566 from rfc-ref.txt .


Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
studying the recently published RFC 4591 (FR over L2TPv3)
authored by you, I found a couple of flaws that perhaps
should be addressed by an RFC Errata Note.

In the text snippits presented below, essentially modified lines,
(and occasionally, original lines to be modified as well) are
marked with a change bar, '|', in column 1.  Up/down pointing
tags ('^^^'/'vvv') are added in additional auxiliary lines,
where appropriate, to emphasize the location of proposed changes.
Indentation of RFC text is preserved, and changed text is re-
adjusted according to RFC formatting rules.


(1)  [line folding issue]

The final part of Section 3.2, on page 5 of RFC 4591, syas:

   General Result Codes regarding L2TP session establishment are defined
   in [RFC3931].  Additional Frame Relay result codes are defined as
   follows:

      17: FR PVC was deleted permanently (no longer provisioned) 18: FR
      PVC has been INACTIVE for an extended period of time 19:
      Mismatched FR Header Length

For clarity, the RFC sould say instead:

   General Result Codes regarding L2TP session establishment are defined
   in [RFC3931].  Additional Frame Relay result codes are defined as
   follows:

|     17: FR PVC was deleted permanently (no longer provisioned)
|     18: FR PVC has been INACTIVE for an extended period of time
|     19: Mismatched FR Header Length


(2)  [another line folding issue]

Within Section 3.5, on page 7, the RFC text just below the diagram
says:

   The Frame Relay Header Length Type is a 2-octet unsigned integer with
   the following values defined in this document:

      2: Two-octet Frame Relay Header 4: Four-octet Frame Relay Header

For clarity, the RFC sould say instead:

   The Frame Relay Header Length Type is a 2-octet unsigned integer with
   the following values defined in this document:

|     2: Two-octet Frame Relay Header
|     4: Four-octet Frame Relay Header


(3)  [missing colons, and formatting]

In Section 4.1, the explanations just below the FR Header diagrams
on page 8 of the RFC read:

   C/R (bit 6) FR frame C/R (command/response) bit [Q922].

   F - FECN (bit 12):  FR FECN (Forward Explicit Congestion
   Notification) bit [Q922].

   B - BECN (bit 13):
|
   FR BECN (Backward Explicit Congestion Notification) bit [Q922].

   D - DE (bit 14) FR DE bit indicates the discard eligibility [Q922].

For clarity, it should better say:

            vvvvv
|  C (bit 6):     FR frame C/R (command/response) bit [Q922].

|  F (bit 12):    FR FECN (Forward Explicit Congestion Notification)
|                 bit [Q922].

|  B (bit 13):    FR BECN (Backward Explicit Congestion Notification)
|                 bit [Q922].

|  D (bit 14):    FR DE bit indicates the discard eligibility [Q922].
             ^^^^

[ Additional rationale for the proposed clarifications:
  The "full bit names" have been removed from the left hand sides
  (corresponding to the diagrams), and replaced "C/R" by "C", because
  these "full bit names" do not appear in the diagrams, but already do
  appear in the explanatory text on the right hand side.  Thus, to the
  left of the colons, there now are only -- and precisely -- the terms
  from the diagrams. ]


(4)  [typo + word omission]

The first paragraph of Section 4.3, on page 9, says:
                                                           vv
   With L2TPv3 as the tunneling protocol, the packet resulted from the
   encapsulation is N bytes longer than Frame Relay frame without the
   opening and closing HDLC flags or FCS.  The value of N depends on the
   following fields:

It should say:
                                                           vvv
|  With L2TPv3 as the tunneling protocol, the packet resulting from the
|  encapsulation is N bytes longer than the Frame Relay frame without
   the opening and closing HDLC flags or FCS.  The value of N depends on
   the following fields:

Hello,
reading the recently published RFC 4550 (IMAP Lemonade Profile)
authored by you, I found a two flaws that should be addressed
by an RFC Errata Note:


(1)  [word omission]

In the last sentence of Section 1.1, on page 3, RFC 4550 says:

                    [...].  In particular, examples assume that Lemonade
   Submit and IMAP servers support all Lemonade extensions described in
   this document, so they don't show how to deal with absence of an
   extension.

Is should say:

                    [...].  In particular, examples assume that Lemonade
   Submit and IMAP servers support all Lemonade extensions described in
|  this document, so they don't show how to deal with the absence of an
   extension.


(2)  [outdated Ref.]

On page 21, Section 9.2 gives the Informative Reference:

   [IMAP-DISC] Melnikov, A., "Synchronization operations for
               disconnected IMAP4 clients", Work in Progress, October
               2004.

This I-D has been published -- synchronized with RFC 4550 --,
as RFC 4549  ( -- to be precise: 75 minutes before RFC 4550 :-) ).
Therefore, the above lines should be replaced by the rfc-ref.txt
entry for RFC 4549.


Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
reading the recently published RFC 4595 (IKEv2 in FC-SP)
authored by you, I unfortunately discovered in that document
another instance of a "very popular" outdated Normative Reference:

In Section 7.1, on page 14, RFC 4595 says:

   [NIST.180-1.1995]
              National Institute of Standards and Technology, "Secure
              Hash Standard", NIST 180-1, April 1995.

(This Ref. appears only once in the RFC text, in Section 3.2,
just above the bottom of page 8.)

FIPS-PUB 180-1 has been obsoleted long ago by FIPS-PUB 180-2,
issued "2002 August 1".  FIPS-PUB 180-2 contains a re-formulation
of SHA-1 fitted into the new framework used to describe the
additional SHA versions also contained therein.

The current revision of the NIST's Secure Hash Standard is
   "FIPS-PUB 180-2 + Change Notice 1",
issued "2004 Feb 25", which has added SHA-224 to the repertoire.

If NIST publications are used as References in IETF publications,
current revisions should be used.

In the case of SHA-1, perhaps preferrably, RFC 3174 is available
as a (secondary) dedicated reference that will not change.


Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
reading the recently published RFC 4577 (OSPF for BGP/MPLS IP VPNs)
authored by you, I found a couple of issues that perhaps need to
be addressed.


(1)  [typo?]

Section 4.2.1 of RFC 4577, in the last paragraph on page 9, says:

   Generally, though not necessarily, if the PE attaches to several CEs
   in the same OSPF domain, it will associate the interfaces to those
   PEs with a single VRF.

I strongly suspect that the final "PEs" is a typo, and should be
replaced by "CEs".
Thus, the RFC should say:

   Generally, though not necessarily, if the PE attaches to several CEs
   in the same OSPF domain, it will associate the interfaces to those
|  CEs with a single VRF.


(2)  [orphaned inter-section references]

Section 4.2.4 of RFC 4577 contains three (3) distinct references
to itself.  This cannot have been intended.

Within Section 4.2.2, the last two paragraphs on page 11 say:

                                                           vvvvv
   A Domain Identifier is an eight-byte quantity that is a valid BGP
|  Extended Communities attribute, as specified in Section 4.2.4.  If a
   particular OSPF instance has a non-NULL Domain Identifier, when
   routes from that OSPF instance are distributed by BGP as VPN-IPv4
   routes, the routes MUST carry the Domain Identifier Extended
   Communities attribute that corresponds to the OSPF instance's Primary
   Domain Identifier.  If the OSPF instance's Domain Identifier is NULL,
   the Domain Identifier Extended Communities attribute MAY be omitted
   when routes from that OSPF instance are distributed by BGP;
   alternatively, a value of the Domain Identifier Extended Communities
|  attribute that represents NULL (see Section 4.2.4) MAY be carried
   with the route.
                                               ^^^^^
   If the OSPF instances of an OSPF domain are given one or more non-
   NULL Domain Identifiers, this procedure allows us to determine
   whether a particular OSPF-originated VPN-IPv4 route belongs to the
   same domain as a given OSPF instance.  We can then determine whether
   the route should be redistributed to that OSPF instance as an inter-
   area route or as an OSPF AS-external route.  Details can be found in
|  Sections 4.2.4 and 4.2.8.1.
            ^^^^^

I am not sure what really was intended to say.  Perhaps, the
second instance of "4.2.4" should be replaced by "4.2.6".

Please check and supply corrected text.


(3)  [typo: punctuation]

Section 4.2.7 of RFC 4577, on page 16, says:

   This section describes the protocol and procedures necessary for the
|  support of "Sham Links," as defined herein.  Support for sham links
   is an OPTIONAL feature of this specification.

It should say:

   This section describes the protocol and procedures necessary for the
|  support of "Sham Links", as defined herein.  Support for sham links
   is an OPTIONAL feature of this specification.


(4)  [typo: grammar]

In Section 4.2.7.1, the last paragraph on page 16 says:

   If it is desired to have OSPF prefer the routes through the backbone
   over the routes through the backdoor link, then the routes through
|  the backbone must be appear to be intra-area routes.  [...]
                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It should say:

   If it is desired to have OSPF prefer the routes through the backbone
   over the routes through the backdoor link, then the routes through
|  the backbone must appear to be intra-area routes.  [...]
                ^^^^^^^^^^^

(5)  [typo: inconsistent spelling/capitalization]

In Section 4.2.7.1, the second paragraph on page 17 contains
the sentence:
                                           vvvvvvvvv
                             [...].  If the VRF is associated with only
|  a single OSPF instance, and if the PE's router id in that OSPF
   instance is an IP address, then the Sham Link Endpoint Address MAY
   default to that Router ID.  [...]

Consistently with all other occurrences of the term, "Router ID"
in this memo, it should say:

                             [...].  If the VRF is associated with only
|  a single OSPF instance, and if the PE's Router ID in that OSPF
   instance is an IP address, then the Sham Link Endpoint Address MAY
   default to that Router ID.  [...]


(6)  [word omission]

The 4th paragraph of Section 4.2.7.2, near the bottom of page 17,
says:

   A sham link connecting two VRFs is considered up if and only if a
   route to the 32-bit remote endpoint address of the sham link has been
|  installed in VRF.

It should say:

   A sham link connecting two VRFs is considered up if and only if a
   route to the 32-bit remote endpoint address of the sham link has been
|  installed in the VRF.
                ^^^


I propose that you prepare an Author's Errata Note to address
these issues, making freely use of the material presented above.

Only item (2) seems to needs new text from you; all other items
perhaps can be carried forward unchanged to the Errata Note --
you might just direct the RFC-Ed. to copy the text above,

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
reading the recently published RFC 4584 (Socket API for MIPv6)
authored by you, I found a lot of textual issues that might
need consideration.

In this message, I will report only issues deemed significant
enough (substantially improving clarity) to be incorporated
into an RFC Errata Note.

Further issues (mostly regarding grammar and text formatting)
will be discussed with the authors separately.


(1)  separation of machine readable text and RFC text,
     and missing articles

Section 4.6 of RFC 4584, on page 14, says:

   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery changes are also defined in
   <netinet/icmp6.h>.

      New 'Home Agent' flag in router advertisement:  #define
      ND_RA_FLAG_HOMEAGENT   0x20  /* Home Agent flag in RA */

      New Router flag with prefix information of the home agent:
      #define  ND_OPT_PI_FLAG_ROUTER  0x20  /* Router flag in PI */

   As per the Mobile IPv6 specification [2], Section 7.2, a Home Agent
   MUST include at least one prefix option with the Router Address (R)
   bit set.  Advanced Socket API [1] defines data structure for prefix
   option as follows:

     [...]

It should say:

   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery changes are also defined in
   <netinet/icmp6.h>.

|  New 'Home Agent' flag in router advertisement:
|
|     #define  ND_RA_FLAG_HOMEAGENT   0x20  /* Home Agent flag in RA */

|  New Router flag with prefix information of the home agent:
|
      #define  ND_OPT_PI_FLAG_ROUTER  0x20  /* Router flag in PI */

   As per the Mobile IPv6 specification [2], Section 7.2, a Home Agent
   MUST include at least one prefix option with the Router Address (R)
|  bit set.  The Advanced Socket API [1] defines a data structure for
|  the prefix option as follows:


(2)  unusual capitalization, et al.

All instances of "IPV6" and "ICMPV6" in the RFC text should be
changed to "IPv6" and "ICMPv6", respectively.

E.g., the last paragraph of Section 5, on page 17,

   Legacy IPv6 applications/implementations using the Advanced Socket
   API [1] mechanisms, upon receiving Home Address destination options
   or Routing headers(Type 2), will discard the packet as per Sections
   4.2 and 4.4 of IPV6 Protocol [3] specification, respectively;
   otherwise, they should properly handle the Home Address destination
   option and the Routing Header Type 2 specified in this document.

should say (also incorporating other corrections):

   Legacy IPv6 applications/implementations using the Advanced Socket
   API [1] mechanisms, upon receiving Home Address destination options
   or Routing headers (Type 2), will discard the packet as per Sections
   4.2 and 4.4 of the IPv6 Protocol [3] specification, respectively;
   otherwise, they should properly handle the Home Address destination
   option and the Routing Header Type 2 specified in this document.

and the first paragraph of Section 5.1, on page 17,

|  The IPv6 Protocol [3] defines a Routing header extension header for
   Type 0.  Thus, in order to access the IPv6 Routing header Type 2
   extension header, one MUST use type = 2 and segment = 1.  The
|  following existing functions defined in the Advanced Sockets API for
   IPv6 [1] are supported for Mobile IPv6 applications for sending and
   receiving Routing Header Type 2 headers:

Other places affected are:
  Section 5.3, 1st paragraph (page 19);
  Section 6.1, first paragraph (page 21) -- see below.


(3)  grammar

In section 5.3, the last paragraph on page 19 says:

   Any user-level implementation or application that sends the Home
   address destination option through ancillary data objects should
   follow the order extension header defined in this document when using
   IPV6_MIPDSTOPTS socket options.

It should say:

   Any user-level implementation or application that sends the Home
   address destination option through ancillary data objects should
|  follow the order of extension headers defined in this document when
|  using the IPV6_MIPDSTOPTS socket options.


(4)  misleading wording, etc.

The first paragraph of Section 6.1, on p. 21/22, says:

   This specification recommends that the IPv6 RAW sockets mechanism
   send and receive Mobility Header (MH) packets.  The behavior is
|  similar to ICMPV6 processing, where the kernel passes a copy of the
   mobility header packet to the receiving socket.  Depending on the
   implementation, the kernel may process the mobility header in
   addition to passing the mobility header to the application.  In order
   to comply with the restriction in the Advanced Sockets API for IPv6
   [1], applications should set the IPV6_CHECKSUM socket option with
 <<page break>>
   IPPROTO_MH protocol RAW Sockets.  A Mobile IPv6 implementation that
   supports the Mobile IPv6 API must implement Mobility Header API
   checksum calculations by default at the kernel for both incoming and
   outbound paths.  A Mobile IPv6 implementation must not return error
   on the IPV6_CHECKSUM socket option setting, even if the socket option
   is a NO-OP function for that implementation because it verifies the
   checksum at the kernel level.  The Mobility Header checksum procedure
   is described in the Mobile IPv6 Protocol [2] specification.  Again,
   for application portability it is recommended that the applications
   set the IPV6_CHECKSUM socket option along with the RAW sockets for
   IPPROTO_MH protocol.

(The marked line is misleading.)
It should say:

   This specification recommends that the IPv6 RAW sockets mechanism
   send and receive Mobility Header (MH) packets.  The behavior is
|  similar to ICMPv6 processing; the kernel passes a copy of the
   mobility header packet to the receiving socket.  Depending on the

Hello,
reading the recently published RFC 4592 (DNSEXT WCARD)
authored by you, I found a few textual issues that should
be noted.  (Apparently, most of these issues have been
introduced after the I-D version I had read last year.)

I use change bars ('|' in column 1) to mark issues/changes.
Proposed (changed) text is re-adjusted to conform with RFC
formatting rules.


(1)  [improper/misleading wording]

In the explanations to the Example in Section 2.2.1, RFC 4592
(near the top of page 9) says:

|  The following responses would not be synthesized from any of the
|  wildcards in the zone:

This wording is improper/misleading.
Perhaps, the RFC should better say:

|  The following queries would not cause RRs to be synthesized for the
|  answer from any of the wildcards in the zone:


(2)  [typo]

The last paragraph of Section 2.2.2, on page 10, says:

   As RFC 1034 also defines "an authoritative name error indicating that
|  the name does not exist" in section 4.3.1, so this apparently is not
   the intent of the original definition, justifying the need for an
   updated definition in the next section.

"As ..., so ..." is redundant.
Thus, the RFC should say instead:

   As RFC 1034 also defines "an authoritative name error indicating that
|  the name does not exist" in section 4.3.1, this apparently is not the
   intent of the original definition, justifying the need for an updated
   definition in the next section.


(3)  [typo]

In Section 3.3.1, the 4th paragraph, on page 12, says:

   A source of synthesis does not guarantee having a RRSet to use for
   synthesis.  The source of synthesis could be an empty non-terminal.

It should say:

|  A source of synthesis does not guarantee having an RRSet to use for
   synthesis.  The source of synthesis could be an empty non-terminal.


(4)  [typo]

In Section 3.3.3, the last paragraph on page 13 says:

   This is essentially the same text in part 'a' covering the processing
   of CNAME RRSets.

It should say:

|  This is essentially the same text as in part 'a' covering the
   processing of CNAME RRSets.


(5)  [incomplete change in example?]

In Section 4.4, the second-to-last paragraph on page 16 says:

   The DNAME specification is not clear on whether DNAME records in a
   cache are used to rewrite queries.  In some interpretations, the
   rewrite occurs; in others, it does not.  Allowing for the occurrence
   of rewriting, queries for "sub.a.b.example. A" may be rewritten as
|  "sub.foo.bar.tld. A" by the former caching server and may be
|  rewritten as "sub.a.foo.bar.tld. A" by the latter.  Coherency is
   lost, and an operational nightmare ensues.

"tld." does never appear in the preceding text; apparently it has
been replaced there by "example.net."
Therefore, the RFC should say instead:

   The DNAME specification is not clear on whether DNAME records in a
   cache are used to rewrite queries.  In some interpretations, the
   rewrite occurs; in others, it does not.  Allowing for the occurrence
   of rewriting, queries for "sub.a.b.example. A" may be rewritten as
|  "sub.foo.bar.example.net. A" by the former caching server and may be
|  rewritten as "sub.a.foo.bar.example.net. A" by the latter.  Coherency
   is lost, and an operational nightmare ensues.


I propose to publish an RFC Errata Note to address these issues,
making use of the material above.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
reading RFC 4386 authored by you, I found a few textual issues
that should be clarified.


(1)  Section 2, page 2

The RFC says:

   C-FR  RFC 3034 defines a label-switching-controlled Frame Relay
         (LC-FR) interface.  Packets traversing such an interface carry
         labels in the DLCI field

   C-ATM RFC 3035 defines a label-switching-controlled ATM (LC-ATM)
         interface as an ATM interface controlled by the label switching
         control component.  [...]

The acronyms, "C-FR" and "C-ATM", do not appear elsewhere in the text.
Apparently, the first column has been cut off, and the RFC should say
instead:

   LC-FR
         RFC 3034 defines a label-switching-controlled Frame Relay
         (LC-FR) interface.  Packets traversing such an interface carry
         labels in the DLCI field

   LC-ATM
         RFC 3035 defines a label-switching-controlled ATM (LC-ATM)
         interface as an ATM interface controlled by the label switching
         control component.  [...]


(2)  Section 5, page 4

The last sentence of Section 5 says:

    [...].  Note that mplsLcAtmStdUnlabTrafVci and mplsLcAtmStdCtrlVci
   MUST not be equal; nor should mplsLcAtmStdCtrlVpi or
   mplsLcAtmStdUnlabTrafVpi be equal.

I strongly suspect that this is not true.

Perhaps, the  (Vpi, Vci) - *pairs*  must not be equal for every
mplsLcAtmStdInterfaceConfEntry.

Please comment.


I propose to submit an RFC Errata Note to the RFC Editor after
resolution of item (2) above.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
reading the recently published RFC 4377 authored by you
and many co-authors, I found a few textual issues that
perhaps should be addressed by an RFC Errata Note.

Because these issues seem to be quite straightforward,
I only have addressed this message to you and CC'ed it
to the RFC-Ed., to avoid a mail explosion.
Please feel free to contact your co-authors, or even the
mailing list, if it deems appropriate to you, anyway.

I use change bars ('|' in column 1) to mark issues/changes.
Proposed (changed) text is re-adjusted to conform with RFC
formatting rules.


(1)  Section 2.1 -- word omission

Near the bottom of page 3, RFC 4377 says:

   One-hop Delay:             The fixed delay experienced by a packet to
                              reach the next hop resulting from the of
                              the propagation latency, the transmission
                              latency, and the processing latency.

It should say:

   One-hop Delay:             The fixed delay experienced by a packet to
|                             reach the next hop resulting from the sum
                              of the propagation latency, the
                              transmission latency, and the processing
                              latency.


(2)  Section 4.1 -- word omission

The second paragraph of Section 4.1, on page 5, says:

   Furthermore, the automation of path liveliness is desired in cases
   where large numbers of LSPs might be tested.  [...]

It should perhaps say,
either (2a):

|  Furthermore, the automation of path liveliness detection is desired
   in cases where large numbers of LSPs might be tested.  [...]

or (2b):

|  Furthermore, the automation of path liveliness testing is desired in
   cases where large numbers of LSPs might be tested.  [...]

Thomas, please select the alternative you prefer.


(3)  Section 4.11.1 -- wrong wording, and a missing article

Section 4.11.1, on page 11, contains the bullets:

      (1) At an ingress LSR, accounting of traffic through LSPs that
|         begin at each egress in question.
          ^^^^^

      (2) At an intermediate LSR, accounting of traffic through LSPs for
          each pair of ingress to egress.

            v
|     (3) At egress LSR, accounting of traffic through LSPs for each
          ingress.

The RFC should say instead:

      (1) At an ingress LSR, accounting of traffic through LSPs that
|         end at each egress in question.

      (2) At an intermediate LSR, accounting of traffic through LSPs for
          each pair of ingress to egress.

|     (3) At an egress LSR, accounting of traffic through LSPs for each
          ingress.


Please comment, or directly acknowledge to the RFC-Ed. the items
above for publication in an RFC Errata Note.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
reading the recently published RFC 4379 (Detecting MPLS Data Plane
Failures) authored by you, I found a couple of textual issues that
perhaps should be addressed by an RFC Errata Note.

I use change bars ('|' in column 1) to mark issues/changes.
Proposed (changed) text is re-adjusted to conform with RFC
formatting rules.


(1)  Section 3 -- Wrong Length value in example

The FEC TLV example on page 9 starts with the lines:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |      Type = 1 (FEC TLV)       |          Length = 12          |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      [...]
      [ followed by 8 words (of 4 bytes each) ]

According to Section 3.3 of the LDP specification, RFC 3036,
the Lenght element of LDP TLVs measures the size of the Value
element in bytes.
Therefore, 'Length = 12' is wrong, it should be 'Length = 32'.

Hence, the RFC should say:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|     |      Type = 1 (FEC TLV)       |          Length = 32          |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      [...]


(2)  Section 3.3.1 -- formating error

The second encoding diagram on page 27,

    0                   1                   2                   3

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


(3)  Section 4.4 -- word omission

On page 35, the RFC text contains the bullet:

   Best-return-code:  contains the return code for the echo reply packet
                      as currently best known.  As algorithm progresses,
                      this code may change depending on the results of
                      further checks that it performs.

It should say:

   Best-return-code:  contains the return code for the echo reply packet
|                     as currently best known.  As the algorithm
                      progresses, this code may change depending on the
                      results of further checks that it performs.


(4)  Section 4.4 -- word omission in pseudo-code comment

On page 38, within the pseudocode comment, the RFC says:

         [...]
         may be greater than Label-stack-depth.  To be consistent with
         the above stack-depths, the bottom is considered to entry 1.
         */

It should say:

         [...]
         may be greater than Label-stack-depth.  To be consistent with
|        the above stack-depths, the bottom is considered to be entry 1.
         */


(5)  Section 4.4 -- wrong internal section reference

The last paragraph of section 4.4 (Step 7.), on page 40, says:

      Send an MPLS echo reply with a Return Code of Best-return-code,
      and a Return Subcode of Best-rtn-subcode.  Include any TLVs
      created during the above process.  The procedures for sending
|     the echo reply are found in subsection 4.4.1.
                                             ^^^^^
It should say:

      Send an MPLS echo reply with a Return Code of Best-return-code,
      and a Return Subcode of Best-rtn-subcode.  Include any TLVs
      created during the above process.  The procedures for sending
|     the echo reply are found in subsection 4.5.


(6)  Section 5.1 -- outdated Normative Reference

On page 43, the tag  [NTP]  points to RFC 2030.
At the time of publication of RFC 4377, RFC 2030 already had been
obsoleted by RFC 4330.
Therefore, the text after  [NTP]  should be replaced by the
rfc-ref.txt entry for RFC 4330.


(7)  Section 6 -- typo

At the end of the second paragraph on page 4, the RFC says:

                                    [...].  However, to provide a
   stronger defense, an implementation MAY also validate the TimeStamp
|  Sent by requiring and exact match on this field.
                       ^

It should say:

                                    [...].  However, to provide a
   stronger defense, an implementation MAY also validate the TimeStamp
|  Sent by requiring an exact match on this field.


Authors, please comment, or just acknowledge to the RFC Editor
the above material for publication in an RFC Errata Note.

Hello,
in the recently published RFC 4427 (GMPLS Recovery Terminology)
edited by you, I found a few textual flaws that perhaps should
be addressed by an RFC Errata Note.

I use change bars ('|' in column 1) to mark issues/changes.
Proposed (changed) text is re-adjusted to conform with RFC
formatting rules.


(1)  [missing article]

On page 16, in Section 5, the text for 'Phase 3: Failure Notification'
says:

   Failure notification phase is used 1) to inform intermediate nodes
   that LSP(s)/span(s) failure has occurred and has been detected and 2)
   to inform the recovery deciding entities (which can correspond to any
   intermediate or end-point of the failed LSP/span) that the
   corresponding LSP/span is not available.

It should say:

|  The failure notification phase is used 1) to inform intermediate
   nodes that LSP(s)/span(s) failure has occurred and has been detected
   and 2) to inform the recovery deciding entities (which can correspond
   to any intermediate or end-point of the failed LSP/span) that the
   corresponding LSP/span is not available.


(2)  [singular-->plural]

In Section 6.3, at the bottom of page 18, RFC 4427 says:

              [...].  At the egress node, the normal traffic is selected
|  from either its working or one of the protection LSP/span.

   Unprotected extra traffic can be transported over the M protection
|  LSP/span whenever the protection LSPs/spans is not used to carry a
   normal traffic.

It should say:

              [...].  At the egress node, the normal traffic is selected
|  from either its working or one of the protection LSPs/spans.

   Unprotected extra traffic can be transported over the M protection
|  LSPs/spans whenever the protection LSPs/spans is not used to carry a
   normal traffic.


(3)  [missing verb]

The first paragraph of Section 7.1, on page 19, says:

   [..]  Note that the restoration resources must be pre-computed, must
   be signaled, and may be selected a priori, but may not cross-
   connected.  Thus, the restoration LSP is not able to carry any
   extra-traffic.

It should say:

   [..]  Note that the restoration resources must be pre-computed, must
|  be signaled, and may be selected a priori, but may not be cross-
   connected.  Thus, the restoration LSP is not able to carry any
   extra-traffic.


Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

edited by you, I found a couple of textual flaws that perhaps
should be addressed by an RFC Errata Note.

I use change bars ('|' in column 1) to mark issues/changes.
The proposed text changes intentionally have been aligned in style
and wording with the remainder of the RFC; proposed text generally
is re-adjusted to conform with RFC formatting rules.


(1)  [missing articles]

In Section 4.1, the third paragraph on page 7 says:

   In pre-OTN networks, a failure may be masked by intermediate O-E-O
   based Optical Line System (OLS), preventing a Photonic Cross-Connect
   (PXC) from detecting upstream failures.  In such cases, failure
   detection may be assisted by an out-of-band communication channel,
   and failure condition may be reported to the PXC control plane.  This
   can be provided by using [RFC4209] extensions that deliver IP
   message-based communication between the PXC and the OLS control
   plane.  [...]

It should say:

|  In pre-OTN networks, a failure may be masked by an intermediate O-E-O
   based Optical Line System (OLS), preventing a Photonic Cross-Connect
   (PXC) from detecting upstream failures.  In such cases, failure
   detection may be assisted by an out-of-band communication channel,
|  and a failure condition may be reported to the PXC control plane.
   This can be provided by using [RFC4209] extensions that deliver IP
   message-based communication between the PXC and the OLS control
   plane.  [...]


(2)  [unexpected break]

Again on page 7, later on in the same paragraph as mentioned above,
the RFC says:

           [...].  If the intermediate OLS supports electrical (digital)
   mechanisms, using the LMP communication channel, these failure
|  conditions are reported to
|
   the PXC and subsequent recovery actions are performed as described in
   Section 5.  As such, from the control plane viewpoint, this mechanism
   turns the OLS-PXC-composed system into a single logical entity, thus
   having the same failure management mechanisms as any other O-E-O
   capable device.

It should say:

           [...].  If the intermediate OLS supports electrical (digital)
   mechanisms, using the LMP communication channel, these failure
|  conditions are reported to the PXC and subsequent recovery actions
   are performed as described in Section 5.  As such, from the control
   plane viewpoint, this mechanism turns the OLS-PXC-composed system
   into a single logical entity, thus having the same failure management
   mechanisms as any other O-E-O capable device.


(3)  [incomplete wording]

At the end of Section 4.1, in the last bullet, on page 8, the RFC says:

     o with out-of-band communication between entities: entities are
       physically separated, but an out-of-band communication channel is
       provided between them (e.g., using [RFCF4204]).

It should say:

     o with out-of-band communication between entities: entities are
       physically separated, but an out-of-band communication channel is
|      provided between them (e.g., using LMP [RFCF4204]).


(4)  [unexpected blank line]

In Section 5.5.1, the diagram for option '2. Overbooking', near the
bottom of page 22, suffers from an unexpected blank line.

The RFC says:

                    +----- Dedicated (for instance: 1+1, 1:1, etc.)
                    |
                    |
|
                    +----- Shared (for instance: 1:N, M:N, etc.)
                    |
   Level of         |
   Overbooking -----+----- Unprotected (for instance: 0:1, 0:N)

It should say:

                    +----- Dedicated (for instance: 1+1, 1:1, etc.)
                    |
                    |
                    +----- Shared (for instance: 1:N, M:N, etc.)
                    |
   Level of         |
   Overbooking -----+----- Unprotected (for instance: 0:1, 0:N)


(5)  [typo: missing underscore]

In Section 7.2, the second-to-last paragraph on page 29 says:

   In SONET/SDH environments, one typically considers the VT_SPE/LOVC
   and STS SPE/HOVC as independent layers (for example, VT_SPE/LOVC LSP
   uses the underlying STS_SPE/HOVC LSPs as links).  [...]

It should say:

   In SONET/SDH environments, one typically considers the VT_SPE/LOVC
|  and STS_SPE/HOVC as independent layers (for example, VT_SPE/LOVC LSP
   uses the underlying STS_SPE/HOVC LSPs as links).  [...]


(6)  [singular-->plural]

In Section 8, the second-to-last paragraph on page 33 says:

                              [...].  For instance, it is obvious that
   providing a 1+1 LSP protection minimizes the LSP downtime (in case of
|  failure) while being non-scalable and consuming recovery resource
   without enabling any extra-traffic.
                                                                   ^^

   providing a 1+1 LSP protection minimizes the LSP downtime (in case of
|  failure) while being non-scalable and consuming recovery resources
   without enabling any extra-traffic.


(7)  [singular-->plural]

The third paragraph of Section 8.2, on page 34, says:

                          [...].  Dynamic restoration enables on-demand
   path computation based on the information received through failure
   notification message, and as such, it is more robust with respect to
   the failure scenario scope.

It should say:

                          [...].  Dynamic restoration enables on-demand
   path computation based on the information received through failure
|  notification messages, and as such, it is more robust with respect to
   the failure scenario scope.


(8)  [singular-->plural]

At the bottom of page 35, Section 8.3 of RFC 4428 says:

                          [...].  Recovery schemes, in particular
   restoration, with pre-signaled resource reservation (with or without
   pre-selection) should be capable of reserving an adequate amount of
   resource to ensure recovery from any specific set of failure events,
   such as any single SRLG failure, any two SRLG failures, etc.

It should say:

                          [...].  Recovery schemes, in particular
   restoration, with pre-signaled resource reservation (with or without
   pre-selection) should be capable of reserving an adequate amount of
|  resources to ensure recovery from any specific set of failure events,
   such as any single SRLG failure, any two SRLG failures, etc.


(9)  [punctuation: adjustment for 'logical quoting']

In Section 12.2, some Informative References, as found in the RFC,
do not conform to the RFC style guidelines regarding 'logical quoting'.

E.g., the RFC says, at the bottom of page 44:

   [BOUILLET]   E. Bouillet, et al., "Stochastic Approaches to Compute
                Shared Meshed Restored Lightpaths in Optical Network
|               Architectures," IEEE Infocom 2002, New York City, June
                2002.
                             ^^
It should say:

   [BOUILLET]   E. Bouillet, et al., "Stochastic Approaches to Compute
                Shared Meshed Restored Lightpaths in Optical Network
|               Architectures", IEEE Infocom 2002, New York City, June
                2002.

Similar changes should be applied to the following entries on page 45:

   [DEMEESTER]
   [GLI]
   [KODIALAM1]
   [KODIALAM2]
   [MANCHESTER]
   [T1.105]
   [WANG]
   [G.707]
   [G.709]

and on page 46:

   [G.783]
   [G.798]
   [G.841]
   [G.842]
   [G.874]

  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
studying the recently published RFC 4634 (SHAs and HMAC-SHAs)
authored by you, I found a lot of flaws, including errors in the
sample code.  Here are my comments on this memo.

The items below are grouped into two parts:

The first part lists typos and errors in the code (in textual order of
occurrence) that perhaps should be addressed by an RFC Errata Note.

The second part will present other issues and proposals for further
enhancement of the sample code; that might just be addressed by
updating a publicly available copy of the sample source code, or
any other derived work.
These issues often are related to multiple parts of the sample source
code, and they are presented in order of first occurrence of related
sample source code, unrelated to any scale of importance.

Original text is reproduced without change in indentation.
I use change bars ('|' in column 1) to mark issues/changes.
Where deemed useful, additional lines with up/down pointing tags
('^^^'/'vvv') will be used to emphasize the location of textual
issues and/or proposed changes.
The proposed text changes intentionally have been aligned in style
and wording with the remainder of the RFC; proposed text generally
is re-adjusted to conform with RFC formatting rules.


===  Part 1 -- errata  ===

(1)  [incomplete specification]

Section 3 of RFC 4634, on page 5, defines the elementary word
operations to be used subsequently in the text, including the
left shift operation, '<<'.  Unfortunately, the right shift
operation '>>' is used frequently as well, but not defined
in Section 3.

I propose to amend the second paragraph of Section 3, on page 5,

   In the operations below, x<<n is obtained as follows: discard the
   left-most n bits of x and then pad the result with n zeroed bits on
   the right (the result will still be the same number of bits).

to read:

   In the operations below, x<<n is obtained as follows: discard the
   left-most n bits of x and then pad the result with n zeroed bits on
   the right (the result will still be the same number of bits).
|  Similarly, x>>n is obtained as follows: discard the right-most n bits
|  of x and then prepend the result with n zeroed bits on the left (the
|  result will still be the same number of bits).


(2)  [typo]

The last two text lines of Section 3, on mid-page 6, say:
                                 v
|            ROTL^n(x) = ROTR^(w-x)(x)

             ROTR^n(x) = ROTL^(w-n)(x)

They should say:
                                 v
|            ROTL^n(x) = ROTR^(w-n)(x)

             ROTR^n(x) = ROTL^(w-n)(x)


(3)  [inconsistent prototypes, unpleasant/inconsistent indentation]

In the introductory text in Section 8, function prototype arguments
are inconsistently presented; all should be presented in ANSI-C style
consistently.
Also, the indentation of two lines breaks the otherwise consistent
layout.

On mid-page 16, the lines,

   Functions:
|                 int SHA$$$Reset(SHA$$$Context *);
            Reset the hash context state
|     int SHA$$$Input(SHA$$$Context *, const uint8_t *octets,
                  unsigned int bytecount);
            Incorporate bytecount octets into the hash.

should read:

   Functions:
|     int SHA$$$Reset(SHA$$$Context *context);
            Reset the hash context state
|     int SHA$$$Input(SHA$$$Context *context, const uint8_t *octets,
                  unsigned int bytecount);
            Incorporate bytecount octets into the hash.

and on page 17, the lines,

   Functions:
|     int USHAReset(USHAContext *, SHAversion whichSha);
            Reset the hash context state.
|     int USHAInput(USHAContext *,
                  const uint8_t *bytes, unsigned int bytecount);
            Incorporate bytecount octets into the hash.
|     int USHAFinalBits(USHAContext *,
                  const uint8_t bits, unsigned int bitcount);
|                 Incorporate bitcount bits into the hash.

should read:

   Functions:
|     int USHAReset(USHAContext *context, SHAversion whichSha);
            Reset the hash context state.
|     int USHAInput(USHAContext *context,
                  const uint8_t *bytes, unsigned int bytecount);
            Incorporate bytecount octets into the hash.
|     int USHAFinalBits(USHAContext *context,
                  const uint8_t bits, unsigned int bitcount);
|           Incorporate bitcount bits into the hash.



(4)  Section 8.1 -- sha.h  [terminology]

The initial Description in the file, on page 18 of the RFC, says:

                                             vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
 *  Description:

 *      Notice published on February 28, 2004.

It should say:

 *  Description:
|*      This file implements the Secure Hash Algorithms
 *      as defined in the National Institute of Standards
 *      and Technology Federal Information Processing Standards
 *      Publication (FIPS PUB) 180-1 published on April 17, 1995, 180-2
 *      published on August 1, 2002, and the FIPS PUB 180-2 Change
 *      Notice published on February 28, 2004.

Rationale:

Avoiding the term "Signature" in accordance with the Standards
mentioned.  The NIST consistently uses the acronyms "SHA" for
"Secure Hash Algorithm" and "SHS" for "Secure Hash Standard"
and precisely distinguished between these two terms.


(5)  Section 8.2.1 -- sha.c  [terminology, and clarification]

The initial Description in the file, on page 24 of the RFC, says:

                                             vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
 *  Description:
 *      This file implements the Secure Hash Signature Standard
 *      algorithms as defined in the National Institute of Standards
 *      and Technology Federal Information Processing Standards
 *      Publication (FIPS PUB) 180-1 published on April 17, 1995, 180-2
 *      published on August 1, 2002, and the FIPS PUB 180-2 Change
 *      Notice published on February 28, 2004.

It should say:

 *  Description:
|*      This file implements the Secure Hash Algorithm SHA-1
 *      as defined in the National Institute of Standards
 *      and Technology Federal Information Processing Standards
 *      Publication (FIPS PUB) 180-1 published on April 17, 1995, 180-2
 *      published on August 1, 2002, and the FIPS PUB 180-2 Change
 *      Notice published on February 28, 2004.

Rationale:

See item (4) above.
Also replace "algorithms" by "Algorithm SHA-1" to properly match
the description with the scope of the file.


(6)  Section 8.2.1 -- sha1.c  [clarification in comment text]

The comment text, at the bottom of page 24, says:

 *  Caveats:
 *      SHA-1 is designed to work with messages less than 2^64 bits
 *      long. This implementation uses SHA1Input() to hash the bits
 *      that are a multiple of the size of an 8-bit character, and then
 *      uses SHA1FinalBits() to hash the final few bits of the input.
 */

It should better say:

 *  Caveats:
 *      SHA-1 is designed to work with messages less than 2^64 bits
 *      long. This implementation uses SHA1Input() to hash the bits
 *      that are a multiple of the size of an 8-bit character, and then
|*      optionally uses SHA1FinalBits() to hash the final few bits of
 *      the input.
 */


(7)  Section 8.2.1 -- sha1.c  [wrong constants used]

Near the top of page 25, there is the code:

/*
 * add "length" to the length
 */
static uint32_t addTemp;
#define SHA1AddLength(context, length)                     \
    (addTemp = (context)->Length_Low,                      \
     (context)->Corrupted =                                \
        (((context)->Length_Low += (length)) < addTemp) && \
        (++(context)->Length_High == 0) ? 1 : 0)

It should say (modifying the last line):

/*
 * add "length" to the length
 */
static uint32_t addTemp;
#define SHA1AddLength(context, length)                     \
    (addTemp = (context)->Length_Low,                      \
     (context)->Corrupted =                                \
        (((context)->Length_Low += (length)) < addTemp) && \
        (++(context)->Length_High == 0) ? shaInputTooLong : shaSuccess )

Rationale:

As can be found on page 19 (upper half), sha.h contains:

#ifndef _SHA_enum_
#define _SHA_enum_
/*
 *  All SHA functions return one of these values.
 */
enum {
    shaSuccess = 0,
    shaNull,            /* Null pointer parameter */
    shaInputTooLong,    /* input data too long */
    shaStateError,      /* called Input after FinalBits or Result */
    shaBadParam         /* passed a bad parameter */
};
#endif /* _SHA_enum_ */

This leaves it to the compiler to assign values, but ordinarily,
  shaNull          will be assigned the value 1,
  shaInputTooLong  will be assigned the value 2, etc. ...

The value assigned to context->Corrupted in the #define listed
above will later on repeatedly be used to generate return values,
via code lines:
                 return context->Corrupted;

These return values are expected to be SHA_enum values.
In the case where Corrupted gets assigned the value 0, it apparently
was intended to eventually get the return value 'shaSuccess', and
in the case where Corrupted gets assigned the value 1, it apparently
was intended to eventually get the return value 'shaInputTooLong'.
With the code shown above, the former will work, but the latter
will usually *not* work as intended.

To obtain portable source code behaving as documented, the proposed
change has to be applied.


(8)  Section 8.2.1 -- sha1.c  [inconsistent function prototypes]

Througout the sample source code, ANSI-C style is used for the
function prototypes, i.e. giving type and name for function
arguments.  This rule is broken on mid-page 25, just below
the offending snippit from item (5) above.
For consistency and portability, the source code fragment:

/* Local Function Prototypes */
static void SHA1Finalize(SHA1Context *context, uint8_t Pad_Byte);
static void SHA1PadMessage(SHA1Context *, uint8_t Pad_Byte);
static void SHA1ProcessMessageBlock(SHA1Context *);

should better say, amending the last two lines:

/* Local Function Prototypes */
static void SHA1Finalize(SHA1Context *context, uint8_t Pad_Byte);
static void SHA1PadMessage(SHA1Context *context, uint8_t Pad_Byte);
static void SHA1ProcessMessageBlock(SHA1Context *context);


(9)  Section 8.2.1 -- sha1.c  [improper comment text]

The Description comments for the SHA$$$Result functions repeatedly
contains improper wording and unpleasent formatting.
See below for significant flaws.
This change is proposed for the sake of consistency.

The Description of SHA1Result on page 28, says:

 * Description:
 *   This function will return the 160-bit message digest into the
 *   Message_Digest array provided by the caller.
 *   NOTE: The first octet of hash is stored in the 0th element,
 *      the last octet of hash in the 19th element.

For correctness and consistency, it should better say:

 * Description:
 *   This function will return the 160-bit message digest
 *   into the Message_Digest array provided by the caller.
 *   NOTE:
 *    The first octet of the hash is stored in the element with index 0,
 *    the last octet of the hash in the element with index 19.

[The additional line break has been added to keep the first part
of the last sentence on a single line, under RFC formatting rules.]


(10)  Section 8.2.1 -- sha1.c  [improper comment text]

The Description of SHA1PadMessage, on page 30, says:

 * Description:
 *   According to the standard, the message must be padded to an
 *   even 512 bits. The first padding bit must be a '1'. The last
 *   64 bits represent the length of the original message. All bits
 *   in between should be 0. This helper function will pad the
 *   message according to those rules by filling the Message_Block
 *   array accordingly. When it returns, it can be assumed that the
 *   message digest has been computed.

For clarity, it should say:

 * Description:
|*   According to the standard, the message must be padded to the next
|*   proper multiple of 512 bits. The first padding bit must be a '1'.
 *   The last 64 bits represent the length of the original message.
 *   All bits in between should be 0. This helper function will pad
 *   the message according to those rules by filling the Message_Block
 *   array accordingly. When it returns, it can be assumed that the
 *   message digest has been computed.


(11)  Section 8.2.1 -- sha1.c  [wrong comment text]

The Description of SHA1ProcessMessageBlock, on page 31, says:

 * Parameters:
 *   None.

This is not true, as can be seen subsequently in the source code.
The RFC should say:

 * Parameters:
 *   context: [in/out]
 *     The SHA context to update


(12)  Section 8.2.2 -- sha224-256.c  [wrong comment text]

The initial Description in this file, on page 33, says:

 * Description:
 *   This file implements the Secure Hash Signature Standard
 *   algorithms as defined in the National Institute of Standards
 *   and Technology Federal Information Processing Standards
 *   Publication (FIPS PUB) 180-1 published on April 17, 1995, 180-2
 *   published on August 1, 2002, and the FIPS PUB 180-2 Change
 *   Notice published on February 28, 2004.

It should say:

 * Description:
 *   This file implements the Secure Hash Algorithms SHA-224 and
 *   SHA-256, as defined in the National Institute of Standards
 *   and Technology Federal Information Processing Standards
 *   Publication (FIPS PUB) 180-2 published on August 1, 2002, and
 *   the FIPS PUB 180-2 Change Notice published on February 28, 2004.

Rationale:

FIPS-PUB 180-1 only specified SHA-1, neither SHA-224 nor SHA-256.
FIPS-PUB 180-2 has introduced SHA-256 (and SHA-384 and SHA-512 as
well), and SHA-224 has been introduced by the "Change Notice 1".
Thus, citation of FIPS PUB 180-1 is void and inappropriate in the
context of SHA-224 and SHA-256.
Avoiding the term "Signature" also conforms to the above Standards
-- cf. item (4) and (5) above.
Restricting the text to the scope of the file -- cf. item (5) above.


(13)  Section 8.2.2 -- sha224-256.c  [clarification in comment text]

The comment text, near the bottom of page 33, says:

 * Caveats:
 *   SHA-224 and SHA-256 are designed to work with messages less
 *   than 2^64 bits long. This implementation uses SHA224/256Input()
 *   to hash the bits that are a multiple of the size of an 8-bit
 *   character, and then uses SHA224/256FinalBits() to hash the
 *   final few bits of the input.

It should better say -- cf. item (6) above:

|*   character, and then optionally uses SHA224/256FinalBits()
 *   to hash the final few bits of the input.


(14)  Section 8.2.2 -- sha224-256.c  [wrong constants used]

On mid-page 34, there is the code:

/*
 * add "length" to the length
 */
static uint32_t addTemp;
#define SHA224_256AddLength(context, length)               \
  (addTemp = (context)->Length_Low, (context)->Corrupted = \
    (((context)->Length_Low += (length)) < addTemp) &&     \
    (++(context)->Length_High == 0) ? 1 : 0)

It should say (modifying the last line):

/*
 * add "length" to the length
 */
static uint32_t addTemp;
#define SHA224_256AddLength(context, length)               \
  (addTemp = (context)->Length_Low, (context)->Corrupted = \
    (((context)->Length_Low += (length)) < addTemp) &&     \
    (++(context)->Length_High == 0) ? shaInputTooLong : shaSuccess )

Rationale:  Same as for item (7) above.


(15)  Section 8.2.2 -- sha224-256.c  [misleading typo]

On top of page 35, the Description of SHA224Reset says:

                                          vvv
 * Description:
 *   This function will initialize the SHA384Context in preparation
 *   for computing a new SHA224 message digest.

It should say:

 * Description:
|*   This function will initialize the SHA224Context in preparation
 *   for computing a new SHA224 message digest.


(16)  Section 8.2.2 -- sha224-256.c  [improper comment text]

Similar to item (9) above, the Description comment of SHA224Result
contains improper wording and unpleasent formatting. Additionally,
counting 28 elements as ranging from the "0th" up to the "28th" is
unpleasant and wrong -- it would indicate 29 elements (octets) !

On mid-page 36, the RFC says:

 * Description:
 *   This function will return the 224-bit message
 *   digest into the Message_Digest array provided by the caller.
 *   NOTE: The first octet of hash is stored in the 0th element,
 *      the last octet of hash in the 28th element.

For correctness and consistency, and for improved readability,
it should say:

 * Description:
 *   This function will return the 224-bit message digest
 *   into the Message_Digest array provided by the caller.
 *   NOTE:
 *    The first octet of the hash is stored in the element with index 0,
 *    the last octet of the hash in the element with index 27.


(17)  Section 8.2.2 -- sha224-256.c  [improper comment text]

Similar to item (9) and (16) above, the Description of SHA256Result
contains improper wording and unpleasent formatting. Additionally,
counting 32 elements as ranging from the "0th" up to the "32nd" is
unpleasant and wrong -- it would indicate 33 elements (octets) !

On page 39, the RFC says:

 * Description:
 *   This function will return the 256-bit message
 *   digest into the Message_Digest array provided by the caller.
 *   NOTE: The first octet of hash is stored in the 0th element,
 *      the last octet of hash in the 32nd element.

For correctness and consistency, and for improved readability,
it should say:

 * Description:
 *   This function will return the 256-bit message digest
 *   into the Message_Digest array provided by the caller.
 *   NOTE:
 *    The first octet of the hash is stored in the element with index 0,
 *    the last octet of the hash in the element with index 31.


(18)  Section 8.2.2 -- sha224-256.c  [inconsistent arguments]

The sample code presents almost all formal function arguments of type
array with predefined (constant) length with this explicit length.
Contrary to that, the definition of SHA256Result does not supply
the expected size of the formal argument 'Message_Digest'.

At the bottom of page 39, RFC 4634 says:

int SHA256Result(SHA256Context *context, uint8_t Message_Digest[])
{

For consistency and clarity, it should say:

int SHA256Result(SHA256Context *context,
                 uint8_t Message_Digest[SHA256HashSize])
{


(19)  Section 8.2.2 -- sha224-256.c  [improper comment text]

The Description of SHA224_256PadMessage, near the bottom of page 40,
says:

 * Description:
 *   According to the standard, the message must be padded to an
 *   even 512 bits. The first padding bit must be a '1'. The
 *   last 64 bits represent the length of the original message.
 *   All bits in between should be 0. This helper function will pad
 *   the message according to those rules by filling the
 *   Message_Block array accordingly. When it returns, it can be
 *   assumed that the message digest has been computed.

For clarity, it should say (cf. item (10) above):

 * Description:
|*   According to the standard, the message must be padded to the next
|*   proper multiple of 512 bits. The first padding bit must be a '1'.
 *   The last 64 bits represent the length of the original message.
 *   All bits in between should be 0. This helper function will pad
 *   the message according to those rules by filling the
 *   Message_Block array accordingly. When it returns, it can be
 *   assumed that the message digest has been computed.


(20)  Section 8.2.2 -- sha224-256.c  [imprecise comment text]

The Description of SHA224_256ProcessMessageBlock, on top of page 42,
says:

 * Description:
 *   This function will process the next 512 bits of the message
 *   stored in the Message_Block array.

Consistently with the remainder of the test, it should say:

 * Description:
|*   This helper function will process the next 512 bits of the
 *   message stored in the Message_Block array.


(21)  Section 8.2.2 -- sha224-256.c  [incomplete comment text]

Near the bottom of page 43, the Description of SHA224_256Reset says:

 * Description:
 *   This helper function will initialize the SHA256Context in
 *   preparation for computing a new SHA256 message digest.

For completeness and consistency, it should say:

 * Description:
 *   This helper function will initialize the SHA256Context in
|*   preparation for computing a new SHA-224 or SHA-256 message digest.
                                     ^^^^^^^^^^    ^


(22)  Section 8.2.2 -- sha224-256.c  [improper comment text]

Similar to item (9), (16), and (17) above, the Description of
SHA224_256ResultN contains improper wording. Additionally,
counting 28/32 elements as ranging from the "0th" up to the
"28th/32nd" is unpleasant and wrong -- that erroneously indicates
29/33 elements (octets) !

Near the bottom of page 44, the RFC says:

 * Description:
 *   This helper function will return the 224-bit or 256-bit message
 *   digest into the Message_Digest array provided by the caller.
 *   NOTE: The first octet of hash is stored in the 0th element,
 *      the last octet of hash in the 28th/32nd element.

For correctness and consistency, it should say:

 * Description:
 *   This helper function will return the 224-bit or 256-bit message
 *   digest into the Message_Digest array provided by the caller.
 *   NOTE:
 *    The first octet of the hash is stored in the element with index 0,
 *    the last octet of the hash in the element with index 27/31.


(23)  Section 8.2.3 -- sha384-512.c  [wrong comment text]

The initial Description in this file, on page 45, says:

 * Description:
 *   This file implements the Secure Hash Signature Standard
 *   algorithms as defined in the National Institute of Standards
 *   and Technology Federal Information Processing Standards
 *   Publication (FIPS PUB) 180-1 published on April 17, 1995, 180-2
 *   published on August 1, 2002, and the FIPS PUB 180-2 Change
 *   Notice published on February 28, 2004.

It should say:

 * Description:
 *   This file implements the Secure Hash Algorithms SHA-384 and
 *   SHA-512, as defined in the National Institute of Standards
 *   and Technology Federal Information Processing Standards
 *   Publication (FIPS PUB) 180-2 published on August 1, 2002, and
 *   the FIPS PUB 180-2 Change Notice published on February 28, 2004.

Rationale:

FIPS-PUB 180-1 only specified SHA-1, neither SHA-384 nor SHA-512.
FIPS-PUB 180-2 has introduced SHA-384 and SHA-512 (and SHA-256 as
well), and the "Change Notice 1" has introduced SHA-224.
Thus, citation of FIPS PUB 180-1 is void and inappropriate in the
context of SHA-384 and SHA-512.
Avoiding the term "Signature" also conforms to the above Standards
-- cf. item (4), (5), and (12) above.
Restricting the text to the scope of the file -- cf. item (5) and
(12) above.


(24)  Section 8.2.3 -- sha384-512.c  [clarification in comment text]

The comment text, near the top of page 46, says:

 * Caveats:
 *   SHA-384 and SHA-512 are designed to work with messages less
 *   than 2^128 bits long. This implementation uses
 *   SHA384/512Input() to hash the bits that are a multiple of the
 *   size of an 8-bit character, and then uses SHA384/256FinalBits()

It should better say -- cf. item (6) and (13) above:

|*   character, and optionally then uses SHA384/256FinalBits()

(25)  Section 8.2.3 -- sha384-512.c  [wrong comment text]

The first line on page 50 says:

#else /* !USE_32BIT_ONLY */

It should say:

#else /* !USE_MODIFIED_MACROS */

Rationale:  Look at the #if[n]def structure of the file.


(26)  Section 8.2.3 -- sha384-512.c  [erroneous code]

Within the '#ifdef USE_32BIT_ONLY' macro definition branch of the
file, on mid-page 50 the RFC says:

/*
 * add "length" to the length
 */
static uint32_t addTemp[4] = { 0, 0, 0, 0 };
#define SHA384_512AddLength(context, length) (                        \
    addTemp[3] = (length), SHA512_ADDTO4((context)->Length, addTemp), \
    (context)->Corrupted = (((context)->Length[3] == 0) &&            \
       ((context)->Length[2] == 0) && ((context)->Length[1] == 0) &&  \
       ((context)->Length[0] < 8)) ? 1 : 0 )

It should say:

/*
 * add "length" to the length
 */
static uint32_t addTemp[4] = { 0, 0, 0, 0 };
#define SHA384_512AddLength(context, length) (                        \
    addTemp[3] = (length), SHA512_ADDTO4((context)->Length, addTemp), \
    (context)->Corrupted = (((context)->Length[0] < addTemp[3]) &&    \
       ((context)->Length[1] == 0) && ((context)->Length[1] == 0) &&  \
       ((context)->Length[0] == 0)) ? shaInputTooLong : shaSuccess )

Rationale:

The context words  Lenght[0] ... Length[3]  represent the unsigned
128-bit-wide running (bit-)length of the message text hash so far,
in most-significant word first order.
The code fragment above is intended to add to this value the
unsigned 32-bit value (uint32_t) length, and to detect overflow
(to 2^128 and above).
The given code is wrong.
(Apparently it has never been tested with messages long enough to
exhibit this misbehaviour.)
Other parts of the sample code show how this can be done correctly
in the case of long accumulators consisting of two 32-bit words
-- cf. the code snippits in item (7) and (14) above, and item (27)
below, as well,
The replacement code corrects this issue.

Furthermore, the original code suffers from the same problem as
in item (7) and (14) above; this has been corrected accordingly,
as well.


(27)  Section 8.2.3 -- sha384-512.c  [wrong constants used]

Within the '#ifndef USE_32BIT_ONLY' macro definition branch of the
file, on mid-page 51 the RFC says:

/*
 * add "length" to the length
 */
static uint64_t addTemp;
#define SHA384_512AddLength(context, length)                   \
   (addTemp = context->Length_Low, context->Corrupted =        \
    ((context->Length_Low += length) < addTemp) &&             \
    (++context->Length_High == 0) ? 1 : 0)

It should say:

/*
 * add "length" to the length
 */
static uint64_t addTemp;
#define SHA384_512AddLength(context, length)                   \
   (addTemp = (context)->Length_Low, (context)->Corrupted =    \
    (((context)->Length_Low += length) < addTemp) &&           \
    (++(context)->Length_High == 0) ? shaInputTooLong : shaSuccess )

Rationale:

Same as for item (7) and (14) above, cf. item (26) as well.

Additionally, parentheses have been added around all invocations of
the macro argument `context` to protect it against various artifacts,
as has been done consistently in the remainder of the sample code.


(28)  Section 8.2.3 -- sha384-512.c  [inconsistent arguments]

The sample code presents almost all formal function arguments of type
array with predefined (constant) length with this explicit length.
Contrary to that, the function prototypes for SHA384_512Reset do not
supply the expected size of the formal argument 'H0'.
This inconsistency should be corrected -- as in item (18) above.

There are two instances of the issue (see item (xx) below for
another two similar instances, with the function declarations):

(28a)
Within the function prototype definition part of the
  '#ifdef USE_32BIT_ONLY'
branch of the sample code, near the bottom of page 50, the RFC says:

static int SHA384_512Reset(SHA512Context *context, uint32_t H0[]);

For consistency and clarity, it should say:

static int SHA384_512Reset(SHA512Context *context,
                           uint32_t H0[SHA512HashSize/4]);

(28b)
Within the function prototype definition part of the
  '#else /* !USE_32BIT_ONLY */'
branch of the sample code, near the bottom of page 51, the RFC says:

static int SHA384_512Reset(SHA512Context *context, uint64_t H0[]);

For consistency and clarity, it should say:

static int SHA384_512Reset(SHA512Context *context,
                           uint64_t H0[SHA512HashSize/8]);


(29)  Section 8.2.3 -- sha384-512.c  [improper comment text]

Similar to item (9), (16), (17), and (22) above, the Description
of SHA384Result contains improper wording and unpleasent formatting.
Additionally, counting 48 elements as ranging from the "0th" up to the
"48th" is unpleasant and wrong -- indicating 49 elements (octets) !

Near the bottom of page 53, the RFC says:

 * Description:
 *   This function will return the 384-bit message
 *   digest into the Message_Digest array provided by the caller.
 *   NOTE: The first octet of hash is stored in the 0th element,
 *      the last octet of hash in the 48th element.

For correctness and consistency, and for improved readability,
it should say:

 * Description:
 *   This function will return the 384-bit message digest
 *   into the Message_Digest array provided by the caller.
 *   NOTE:
 *    The first octet of the hash is stored in the element with index 0,
 *    the last octet of the hash in the element with index 47.


(30)  Section 8.2.3 -- sha384-512.c  [improper comment text]

Similar to item (9), (16), (17), (22), and (29) above, the Description
of SHA512Result contains improper wording and unpleasent formatting.
Additionally, counting 64 elements as ranging from the "0th" up to the
"64th" is unpleasant and wrong -- indicating 65 elements (octets) !

Near the bottom of page 44, the RFC says:

 * Description:
 *   This function will return the 512-bit message
 *   digest into the Message_Digest array provided by the caller.
 *   NOTE: The first octet of hash is stored in the 0th element,
 *      the last octet of hash in the 64th element.


For correctness and consistency, and for improved readability,
it should say:

 * Description:
 *   This function will return the 512-bit message digest
 *   into the Message_Digest array provided by the caller.
 *   NOTE:
 *    The first octet of the hash is stored in the element with index 0,
 *    the last octet of the hash in the element with index 63.


(31)  Section 8.2.3 -- sha384-512.c  [improper comment text]

The Description of SHA384_512PadMessage, on page 58, says:

 * Description:
 *   According to the standard, the message must be padded to an
 *   even 1024 bits. The first padding bit must be a '1'. The
 *   last 128 bits represent the length of the original message.
 *   All bits in between should be 0. This helper function will
 *   pad the message according to those rules by filling the
 *   Message_Block array accordingly. When it returns, it can be
 *   assumed that the message digest has been computed.

For clarity, it should say (cf. items (10) and (19) above):

 * Description:
|*   According to the standard, the message must be padded to the next
|*   proper multiple of 1024 bits. The first padding bit must be a '1'.
 *   The last 128 bits represent the length of the original message.
 *   All bits in between should be 0. This helper function will
 *   pad the message according to those rules by filling the
 *   Message_Block array accordingly. When it returns, it can be
 *   assumed that the message digest has been computed.


(32)  Section 8.2.3 -- sha384-512.c  [inconsistent arguments]

The sample code presents almost all formal function arguments of type
array with predefined (constant) length with this explicit length.
Contrary to that, the function definitions for SHA384_512Reset do not
supply the expected size of the formal argument 'H0'.
This inconsistency should be corrected -- as in items (18) and (28)
above.

Near the top of page 65, RFC 4634 says:

#ifdef USE_32BIT_ONLY
static int SHA384_512Reset(SHA512Context *context, uint32_t H0[])
#else /* !USE_32BIT_ONLY */
static int SHA384_512Reset(SHA512Context *context, uint64_t H0[])
#endif /* USE_32BIT_ONLY */

For consistency and clarity, it should say:

#ifdef USE_32BIT_ONLY
static int SHA384_512Reset(SHA512Context *context,
                           uint32_t H0[SHA512HashSize/4]);
#else /* !USE_32BIT_ONLY */
static int SHA384_512Reset(SHA512Context *context,
                           uint64_t H0[SHA512HashSize/8]);
#endif /* USE_32BIT_ONLY */


(33)  Section 8.2.3 -- sha384-512.c  [improper comment text]

Similar to item (9), (16), (17), (22), (29), and (30) above, the
Description of SHA384_512ResultN contains improper wording.
Additionally, counting 48/64 elements as ranging from the "0th" up to
the "48th/64nd" is unpleasant and wrong -- that erroneously indicates
49/65 elements (octets) !

On page 65/66, the RFC says:

 * Description:
 *   This helper function will return the 384-bit or 512-bit message
<< page break >>
 *   digest into the Message_Digest array provided by the caller.
 *   NOTE: The first octet of hash is stored in the 0th element,
 *      the last octet of hash in the 48th/64th element.

For correctness, it should say:

 * Description:
 *   This helper function will return the 384-bit or 512-bit message
<< page break >>
 *   digest into the Message_Digest array provided by the caller.
 *   NOTE:
 *    The first octet of the hash is stored in the element with index 0,
 *    the last octet of the hash in the element with index 47/63.


(34)  Section 8.2.4 -- usha.c  [wrong comment text]

The Description for USHAResult, on top of page 69, says:

 * Description:
 *   This function will return the 160-bit message digest into the
 *   Message_Digest array provided by the caller.
 *   NOTE: The first octet of hash is stored in the 0th element,
 *      the last octet of hash in the 19th element.

It should say:

 * Description:
 *   This function will return the message digest of the appropriate
 *   bit size, as returned by USHAHashSizeBits(whichSHA) for the
 *   'whichSHA' value used in the preceeding call to USHAReset,
 *   into the Message_Digest array provided by the caller.

Rationale:

The given text roughly matches the SHA-1 case, it is wrong for all
other cases.  The arguments presented for items (9), (16), (17),
(22), (29), (30), and (33) above apply as well.
The changed text tries to remain precise while avoiding too much
repetition of facts presented elsewhere in the sample code.


(35)  Section 8.3 -- hmac.c  [argument inconsistency]

The code for (the message oriented) function hmac,
on page 73/74, reads:

int hmac(SHAversion whichSha, const unsigned char *text, int text_len,
    const unsigned char *key, int key_len,
    uint8_t digest[USHAMaxHashSize])
<< page break >>
{
  HMACContext ctx;
  return hmacReset(&ctx, whichSha, key, key_len) ||
         hmacInput(&ctx, text, text_len) ||
         hmacResult(&ctx, digest);
}

It should say:

int hmac(SHAversion whichSha,
         const unsigned char *message_array, int length,
         const unsigned char *key, int key_len,
         uint8_t digest[USHAMaxHashSize])
<< page break >>
{
  HMACContext ctx;
  return hmacReset(&ctx, whichSha, key, key_len) ||
         hmacInput(&ctx, message_array, length) ||
         hmacResult(&ctx, digest);
}

Rationale:

The argument names `message_array` and `length` are used
throughout the sample code, including the Description of the
function hmac, on page 73.
The code shown above was not aligned with this practise and
hence inconsistent with the Description.
This has been resolved by the proposed update, bay changing
the names of 'text' and 'text_len'.

>>>>>  NOTE / Caution :
>>>>>
>>>>>  Similar (and additional) inconsistencies between the
>>>>>  argument names in the 'Parameters:' documentation
>>>>>  and the variable names used in the subsequent code
>>>>>  exist for all hmac* functions, on pages 74..77 ;
>>>>>  in particular, the described 'context' is always
>>>>>  named `ctx` in the code.
>>>>>  Also, capitalization of the leading "HMAC"/"hmac"
>>>>>  in the function names is totally inconsistent.
>>>>>
>>>>>  Resolution of these issues is left as an exercise
>>>>>  to the reader of this note -- or the author of any
>>>>>  future update of the sample code.
>>>>>
>>>>>  Furthermore, the use of "characters" as units of the
>>>>>  message_text in the descriptions is dangerous in the
>>>>>  days of Unicode and UTF-8; "characters" should better
>>>>>  be replaced by "octets" throughout hmac.c !


(36)  Section 8.3 -- hmac.c  [inconsistent comment]

On mid-page 75, the comment within the function hmacReset says:

   * The HMAC transform looks like:
   *
   * SHA(K XOR opad, SHA(K XOR ipad, text))
   *
   * where K is an n byte key.
   * ipad is the byte 0x36 repeated blocksize times
   * opad is the byte 0x5c repeated blocksize times
   * and text is the data being protected.

It should say:

   * The HMAC transform looks like:
   *
   * SHA(K XOR opad, SHA(K XOR ipad, text))
   *
|  * where K is an n byte key, 0-padded to a total of blocksize bytes,
|  * ipad is the byte 0x36 repeated blocksize times,
|  * opad is the byte 0x5c repeated blocksize times,
   * and text is the data being protected.

Rationale:

Without the addition, the 'XOR' operations in the formula are
undefined.  Additionally, punctuation is made uniform.


(37)  Section 8.3 -- hmac.c  [improper comment text]

The Description of hmacResult, on top of page 77, says:

 * Description:
 *   This function will return the N-byte message digest into the
 *   Message_Digest array provided by the caller.
 *   NOTE: The first octet of hash is stored in the 0th element,
 *      the last octet of hash in the Nth element.

It should perhaps just say:

 * Description:
 *   This function will return the N-byte message digest into the
 *   Message_Digest array provided by the caller.

Rationale:
Cf. items (9), (16), (17), (22), (29), (30), and (33) above.
Full replacement text for the last two lines is deemed unnecessary.


(37)  Section 8.4 -- shatest.c  [comment clarification]

The initial Description of the file, as presented on page 78,
contains in its first paragraph the lines:

 *      the seven tests documented for each algorithm in
 *        "The Secure Hash Algorithm Validation System (SHAVS)",
 *        three of which are bit-level tests
 *        (http://csrc.nist.gov/cryptval/shs/SHAVS.pdf)

For clarity, it should better say:

 *      the seven tests documented for each algorithm in
|*        "The Secure Hash Algorithm Validation System (SHAVS)"
|*        (http://csrc.nist.gov/cryptval/shs/SHAVS.pdf),
|*        three of which are bit-level tests


(38)  Section 8.4 -- shatest.c  [unused #define]

On mid-page 82, the RFC text defines the constant:

#define PRINTBASE64 4

which is never used in the subsequent test driver code
(Base64 output is not supported).
Hence, this line should be deleted.


(39)  Section 8.4 -- shatest.c  [misleading comment]

On mid-page 91, there is the comment:

/*
 * Print the string, converting non-printable characters to hex "## ".
 */

It should say:

/*
 * Print the string, converting all characters to hex "## ".
 */

Rationale:

There is a significant mismatch between the comment and the
subsequent code.
This is being resolved by the replacement text.


(40)  Section 8.4 -- shatest.c  [wrong text in code]

on mid-page 96, the code section,

  if (bitcount > 0)
    err = keyarray ? hmacFinalBits(&hmac, bits, bitcount) :
                   USHAFinalBits(&sha, bits, bitcount);
  if (err != shaSuccess) {
    fprintf(stderr, "hashfile(): %s Error %d.\n",
            keyarray ? "hmacResult" : "shaResult", err);
    if (hashfp != stdin) fclose(hashfp);
    return err;
  }

should in fact say:

  if (bitcount > 0)
    err = keyarray ? hmacFinalBits(&hmac, bits, bitcount) :
                   USHAFinalBits(&sha, bits, bitcount);
  if (err != shaSuccess) {
    fprintf(stderr, "hashfile(): %s Error %d.\n",
            keyarray ? "hmacFinalBits" : "shaFinalBits", err);
    if (hashfp != stdin) fclose(hashfp);
    return err;
  }

Rationale:

Self-evident; perhaps cloning error.


===  Part 2 -- further enhancements  ===             delayed!

Ooouuuch !!!
    Part 1 has taken much more time to create,
    and it has become much longer than expected.
    Therefore, to not hold off the above material:
==>
==> I have deleted the [still raw] draft of part 2 from this message.
==> Part 2 will be [finalized and] sent soon, in a separate message.
==>

Hi, I'm looking for updates for various pending or lost errata.

The oldest I'm aware of is an obvious typo in RfC 2045,
submitted by one of the authors (Feb 24 11:31:01 2005 in your
public pending-errata.msgs mbox).

Another is about the example in RFC 2069 (27 Feb 2005 06:07:04
+0100).  My attempts to check this with one of the authors
failed, maybe you have the same problem.  I've posted it here
<http://article.gmane.org/gmane.ietf.rfc.interest:3> (2005-03).

The third erratum about RfC 4282 was only posted here, see
<http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.ietf.rfc.interest/95> 
<http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.ietf.rfc.interest/96>
(December 2005, relatively new).

Some days later a minor but IMO important detail in RFC 2822:
<http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.ietf.rfc.interest/110>
You have that in you public mbox (Tue Jan 10 00:52:39 2006).

At the moment I try to check two other (in addition to 2069)
MD5 related problems in RFC 2938 and the (not yet published)
NNTPext-authinfo with the authors.  The NNTPAUTH issue might
be interesting, because there's a chance to fix it before it's
published.  The RFC 2069 problem could be relevant for the
(future) 2831bis, I hope you find the time to publish it soon.

Regards, Frank

Hello,
in the recently published RFC 4588 (RTP Retransmission Payload Format)
authored by you, I found a few textual issues that perhaps should be
addressed by an RFC Errata Note.

I use change bars ('|' in column 1) and tag lines to mark issues
/ changes.  Proposed (changed) text is re-adjusted to conform with
RFC formatting rules.


(1)  [missing article]

Within Section 4 of RFC 4588, the second paragraph on page 8 says:

            [...].  See Section 8.1 for the specification of how the
   mapping between original and retransmission payload types is done
|  with Session Description Protocol (SDP).

It should say:

            [...].  See Section 8.1 for the specification of how the
   mapping between original and retransmission payload types is done
|  with the Session Description Protocol (SDP).
       ^^^^^


(2)  [improper wording]

The 4th paragraph of Section 6.3, on page 12, says:

            [...].  In such cases, an appropriate "reorder delay"
   algorithm may not actually be timer based, but packet based.  For
|  example, if n number of packets are received after a gap is detected,
   then it may be assumed that the packet was truly lost rather than out
   of order.  This may turn out to be far easier to code on some
   platforms as a very short fixed FIFO packet buffer as opposed to the
   timer-based mechanism.

It should say:

            [...].  In such cases, an appropriate "reorder delay"
   algorithm may not actually be timer based, but packet based.  For
|  example, if n packets are received after a gap is detected, then it
   may be assumed that the packet was truly lost rather than out of
   order.  This may turn out to be far easier to code on some platforms
   as a very short fixed FIFO packet buffer as opposed to the timer-
   based mechanism.

(Alternatively, use  "if a number n of packets ..."  instead of the
 offending "if n number of packets ..." )


(3)  [word omission]

In the first paragraph of Section 6.4, on page 13, RFC 4588 says:

   [...]                                      v
|  Sending NACKs only in regular RTCP compound decreases the maximum
   delay between detecting an original packet loss and being able to
   send a NACK for that packet.  Implementers should consider the
   possible implications of this fact for the application being used.

It should say:

   [...]                                      vvvvvvvvv
|  Sending NACKs only in regular RTCP compound packets decreases the
   maximum delay between detecting an original packet loss and being
   able to send a NACK for that packet.  Implementers should consider
   the possible implications of this fact for the application being
   used.


(4)  [incomplete specification]

Section 8.1 of RFC 4588, on page 15, says:

   The following MIME subtype name and parameters are introduced in this
   document: "rtx", "rtx-time", and "apt".

   The binding used for the retransmission stream to the payload type
   number is indicated by an rtpmap attribute.  The MIME subtype name
   used in the binding is "rtx".

   The "apt" (associated payload type) parameter MUST be used to map the
   retransmission payload type to the associated original stream payload
   type.  If multiple original payload types are used, then multiple
   "apt" parameters MUST be included to map each original payload type
   to a different retransmission payload type.

This text only addresses the use of the media *sub*-type.  Apparently,
it is implied that the media *type* of the associated streams match,
but I could not find a statement to this end in the RFC.
To further interoperability, I strongly propose to amend the above
text with a suitable note, e.g.:

   The following MIME subtype name and parameters are introduced in this
   document: "rtx", "rtx-time", and "apt".

   The binding used for the retransmission stream to the payload type
   number is indicated by an rtpmap attribute.  The MIME subtype name
   used in the binding is "rtx".  The MIME type of the retransmission
   stream MUST be the same as the MIME type of the original stream.

   The "apt" (associated payload type) parameter MUST be used to map the
   retransmission payload type to the associated original stream payload
   type.  If multiple original payload types are used, then multiple
   "apt" parameters MUST be included to map each original payload type
   to a different retransmission payload type.

(In accordance with the language of RFC 4588, but contrary to BCP 13,
 RFC 4288, I have again used the traditional wording "MIME type" here
 instead of the currently recommended "media type".)


(5)  [word omission]

Later on in Section 8.1, on mid-page 15, the RFC says:

      v
|  The syntax is as follows:

      a=fmtp:<number> apt=<apt-value>;rtx-time=<rtx-time-val>

It should say:

      vvvvv
|  The SDP syntax is as follows:

      a=fmtp:<number> apt=<apt-value>;rtx-time=<rtx-time-val>

(There also is a syntax for these parameters when written in a full
 MIME media type specification; this is not presented in the RFC,
 but it must be distinguished from the SDP syntax presented!)


(6)  [excessive text]

The final paragraph of Section 8.6, on mid-page 20, says:

   In the following sections, some example SDP descriptions are
|  presented.  In some of these examples, long lines are folded to meet
|  the column width constraints of this document; the backslash ("\") at
|  the end of a line and the carriage return that follows it should be
|  ignored.

It would suffice to say:

   In the following sections, some example SDP descriptions are
|  presented.

Rationale:
As will be shown below, in the examples given in Section 8.7,
there in fact is no need to perform this artificial line folding.


(7)  [simplification for improved clarity]

The artificial line folding in the examples in Section 8.7 can be
avoided without change in the indentation, while still conforming
with the line length limitations:

a) In the upper half of page 21, the lines,

   a=fmtp:98 profile-level-id=8;config=01010000012000884006682C209\
   0A21F

should read:

   a=fmtp:98 profile-level-id=8;config=01010000012000884006682C2090A21F

b) In the lower half of page 21, the lines,

   a=fmtp:96 profile-level-id=8;config=01010000012000884006682C209\
   0A21F

should read:

   a=fmtp:96 profile-level-id=8;config=01010000012000884006682C2090A21F

c) In the upper half of page 22, the lines,

   a=fmtp:96 profile-level-id=8;config=01010000012000884006682C209\
   0A21F

should read:

   a=fmtp:96 profile-level-id=8;config=01010000012000884006682C2090A21F


(8)  [clarification]

On mid-page 21, the text in Section 8.7 says:

   A special case of the SDP description is a description that contains
   only one original session "m" line and one retransmission session "m"
   line, the grouping is then obvious and FID semantics MAY be omitted
   in this special case only.

It should better say:

   A special case of the SDP description is a description that contains
   only one original session "m" line and one retransmission session "m"
|  line, the grouping is then obvious and lines with grouping syntax
   (FID semantics) MAY be omitted in this special case only.

Rationale:
It is impossible to only omit *semantics*.
Certain *lines* are omitted there -- the lines with grouping syntax
(and FID semantics).
Alternatively, "(FID semantics)" might be omitted entirely from
the changed text, as well.


(9)  [word omission -- clarification]

The first paragraph of Section 10.2, on page 25, says:

   This section shows how to combine retransmissions with layered
   encoding in multicast sessions.  Note that the retransmission
   framework is offered only for small multicast applications.  Refer to
   RFC 2887 [10] for a discussion of the problems of NACK implosion,
   severe congestion caused by feedback traffic, in large-group reliable
   multicast applications.

It should better say:

   This section shows how to combine retransmissions with layered
   encoding in multicast sessions.  Note that the retransmission
   framework is offered only for small multicast applications.  Refer to
|  RFC 2887 [10] for a discussion of the problems of NACK implosion, and
   severe congestion caused by feedback traffic, in large-group reliable

                                                                     ^^^


(10)  [word omission]

In the first paragraph on page 27, text within Section 13 says:

                                            [...].  Refer to Section 9.1
   of the Secure Real-Time Transport Protocol (SRTP) [12] for a
|  discussion the implications of two-time pads and how to avoid them.
             ^

It should say:
                                                    vvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
                                            [...].  Refer to Section 9.1
|  of the Secure Real-Time Transport Protocol (SRTP) specification [12]
|  for a discussion of the implications of two-time pads and how to
   avoid them.
                   ^^^^

(11)  [inconsistency]

In the fourth bullet on page 29, Appendix A.1 says:

   * avg-rtcp-size is approximated by 120 bytes.  This is a rounded-up
     average of 2 SRs, one for each SSRC, containing 40/8/28/32 bytes
     for IPv6/UDP/SR/SDES with CNAME, thus making 105 bytes each; and a
     RR with 40/8/64/32 bytes for IPv6/UDP/2*RR/SDES, making 157 bytes.
     [...]

I cannot follow these computations:
    40+8+28+32 = 105  ???   and   40+8+64+32 = 157  ???
What is wrong there?
Authors, please correct !

BTW:
What follows in the text essentially does not depend on the exact
figures, the rough order of magnitude is all that is needed.
But the presentation should be self-consistent.


(12)  [improvement of wording]

In the 6th bullet of Appendix A.1, the text on page 29/30 says:

        [...].  This means that if a packet is requested for
     retransmission a maximum of 2 times, the corresponding generic NACK
     report block requesting that particular packet is sent in two
 << page break >>
|    consecutive RTCP compounds; likewise, if it is requested for
     retransmission 10 times, then the generic NACK is sent 10 times.
     [...]

It should say:

        [...].  This means that if a packet is requested for
     retransmission a maximum of 2 times, the corresponding generic NACK
     report block requesting that particular packet is sent in two
 << page break >>
|    consecutive RTCP compound packets; likewise, if it is requested for
     retransmission 10 times, then the generic NACK is sent 10 times.
     [...]


(13)  [missing argument / clarification]

On page 31, Appendix A.2 says:
                                               vv
|  To find an estimate of the buffering time, T(), that a streaming
   server shall use in order to enable a given number of retransmissions
   for each packet, N.  [...]

It should say:
                                               vvv
|  To find an estimate of the buffering time, T(N), that a streaming
   server shall use in order to enable a given number of retransmissions
   for each packet, N.  [...]


(14)  [fractional sign]

Within the tables in Appendix A.4, on pages 32 and 33, the RFC text
uses the comma (",") as the fractional sign (central european style).
In IETF documents, the decimal point (".") should be used instead.


Authors, Please comment.
Items (4) / (11) need agreement / text correction from you.
Items (6) + (7) might be considered non-esssential.
All other items seem to be straightforward and suitable for
inclusion in an Errata Note.

I propose that you resolve the open issues and submit an
Author's Errata Note to the RFC Editor, making freely use
of the material presented above.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
in the recently published RFC 4410 (Selectively Reliable Multicast)
authored by you, I found a couple of issues that perhaps should be
addressed by an RFC Errata Note and/or in a future update to the memo.

I use change bars ('|' in column 1) and tag lines to mark issues
/ changes.  Proposed (changed) text is re-adjusted to conform with
RFC formatting rules.


(1)  [contradiction in specification]

The last paragraph of Section 2, on page 6 of RFC 4410, says:

   SRMP is intended for general use under applications that need its
                             vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
|  services and may exist in parallel instances on the same host.  The
   UDP port is therefore established ad hoc from available application
   ports; accordingly, it would not be appropriate to have a well-known
   port for SRMP.

Contrary to that, the first paragraph of Section 4.7, on page 15,
says:
   vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
|  Each host will have a single instance of SRMP supporting all of its
   applications.  Thus, the sender's source rate is the sum of the rates
   of all the clients of the same multicast group.

What's true ?   What's been intended ???


(2)  [simple erratum: inconsistent spelling]

At the bottom of page 7, Section 3.2 says:

   Receiver_Timestamp:
|     16 bits   Echo of the Receiver_Time_Stamp field (in milliseconds)
                of the receiver feedback message.  If the sender has
                time delay between receiving the feedback and echoing
                the timestamp, it MUST adjust the Receiver_Timestamp
                value to compensate.

To adjust with the diagram on top of page 7 and the remainder of the
text, 'Receiver_Time_Stamp' should be spelled out 'Receiver_Timestamp'
here as well.
Thus, the RFC should say:

   Receiver_Timestamp:
|     16 bits   Echo of the Receiver_Timestamp field (in milliseconds)
                of the receiver feedback message.  If the sender has
                time delay between receiving the feedback and echoing
                the timestamp, it MUST adjust the Receiver_Timestamp
                value to compensate.


(3)  [inconsistent message layout - danger of interoperability problems]

The diagram of the Bundle Header Format (Section 3.2, on page 7),

      0              8              16             24             32
      +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+
      |Version| Type |fb_nr | flag  |        bundle_SN            |
      +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+
      |                       Sender_ID                           |
      +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+
      |                       Receiver_ID                         |
      +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+
      |       Sender_Timestamp      |    Receiver_Timestamp       |
      +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+
      |            ...                                            |


and the diagram of the Feedback Message Format (Section 3.3, on page 9),

      0              8              16             24             32
      +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+
      |Version| Type | fb_nr| flag  |             X_r             |
      +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+
      |       Sender_Timestamp      |    Receiver_Timestamp       |
      +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+
      |                       Sender_ID                           |
      +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+
      |                      Receiver_ID                          |
      +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+

show a surprising inconsistency in the order of the (otherwise
comparable) words {Sender_ID, Receiver_ID, S/R_Timestamps} .
I suspect that this might give rise to implementation faults,
leading to interoperability problems.
It better would have been avoided from the beginning by using
the same order of the fields.

BTW: It strikes that in Section 3.2, the sequence of the field
explanations does not agree with the order in the diagram (as is
the case throughout the remainder of the RFC); instead, the
explanations of just those four fields is given in the order
of the diagram and explanation sequence in Section 3.3.
Therefore, the reader could be lead to the conjecture that the
diagram in Section 3.2 is in error and in fact should be aligned
with the diagram in Section 3.3.


(4)  [simple erratum: word twister]

In Section 3.6, near the top of page 12, the RFC says:

   Length:
      16 bits  Length of the payload data in octets (does not the
               include header).

It should say:

   Length:
|     16 bits  Length of the payload data in octets (does not include
|              the header).


(5)  [simple errata: inconsistent terminology]

Contrary to the remainder of the RFC text, Section 3.7 uses the
field name "Sender Address".  To avoid the unfortunate embedded
space character, and to align this section with the remainder
of the RFC, the term "Sender_ID" should be used.
Therefore:

a) the diagram on page 12,

      0              8              16             24             32
      +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+
      |Version| Type |111 |  00000  |          reserved           |
      +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+
      |                            DSN                            |
      +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+
|     |                      Sender Address                       |
      +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+

should be corrected to say:

      0              8              16             24             32
      +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+
      |Version| Type |111 |  00000  |          reserved           |
      +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+
      |                            DSN                            |
      +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+
|     |                         Sender_ID                         |
      +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+

b) the explanation (at the bottom of page 12),

|  Sender_ID:
|     The IP address of the sender of the message being NACKed.

should be corrected to say:

|  Sender_ID:
|     The ID of the sender of the message being NACKed.

See also item (6) below for the full rationale.


(6)  [incomplete specification - IPv4-centric]

In Section 4.2, the second paragraph on page 14 says:

   Also, the bundle length MUST NOT exceed LENGTH_MAX.  If adding a new
   SRMP message will produce a greater length, the SRMP daemon MUST
   initialize a new bundle for the new SRMP messages, and the current
|  bundle should be transmitted immediately.  The recommended value for
|  LENGTH_MAX is 1454 bytes (Ethernet MTU minus IP and UDP header
|  lengths).

Similarly, the first paragraph of Section 4.6, on page 15, says:

   TFMCC is designed for traffic with a fixed message size.  The maximum
|  bundle size (including header) for SRMP is set to a configurable
|  maximum, typically 1454 bytes (Ethernet MTU minus IP and UDP header
|  lengths).  The bundle size will be used in a TCP throughput equation,
   to get a desired source rate.  However, in SRMP, the message size is
   variable because:

Without mention, the marked phrases are strictly IPv4-centric;
they do not apply to the case of IPv6.

The latter scenario is not excluded in the text, and the phrase,
"IPv4 addresses may be used." in the description of all Sender_ID
and Receiver_ID fields supports the suspicion that IPv6 in fact
was intended to be supported.

Please supply improved wording for both text fragments.


(7)  [simple erratum: grammar (singular/plural mismatch)]

The first paragraph of Section 5, on page 17, says:

   SRMP operates in three distinct transmission modes in order to
   deliver varying levels of reliability: Mode 0 for multicast data that
|  does not require reliable transmission, Mode 1 for data that must be
   received reliably by all members of a multicast group, and Mode 2 for
   data that must be received reliably by a single dynamically
   determined member of a multicast group.

It should say:

   SRMP operates in three distinct transmission modes in order to
   deliver varying levels of reliability: Mode 0 for multicast data that
|  do not require reliable transmission, Mode 1 for data that must be
   received reliably by all members of a multicast group, and Mode 2 for
   data that must be received reliably by a single dynamically
   determined member of a multicast group.

Rationale: "data" *is" plural.


Please comment.

I propose that you resolve the open issues and submit an

In accordance with instructions2authors.txt, I am reporting to you
what I believe is an error in RFC 3261 not currently listed on the
errata page.

On page 220, it says "The TEXT-UTF8-TRIM rule is used for descriptive
field contents that are n t quoted strings, where leading and trailing
LWS is not meaningful."  (And no, I'm not talking about the "n t"
typo.)  The rule for TEXT-UTF8-TRIM is

 TEXT-UTF8-TRIM  = 1*TEXT-UTF8char *(*LWS TEXT-UTF8char)
 TEXT-UTF8char = %x21-7E / UTF8-NONASCII

which pretty clearly says that the final character of TEXT-UTF8-TRIM
cannot be whitespace.  TEXT-UTF8-TRIM appears only as the value of a
header field, and the rule for message-header does not generate
trailing whitespace either.

So the text talks about trailing whitespace, which seems reasonable
because whitespace is allowed in many other places, but the grammar
does not allow it.  Was trailing whitespace intended?

Hello,
I just studied the recently published RFC 4596 (Caller Preferences
Uses) authored by you.  There, I found a very small number of typos.

Below, I use change bars ('|' in column 1) and tag lines to mark
issues / changes.  Proposed (changed) text is re-adjusted to conform
with RFC formatting rules, where necessary.


(1)  [singular --> plural]

In the Table of Contents (on page 2), and on page 8, the Section
heading:

3.1. Routing of INVITE and MESSAGE to Different UA

should perhaps read:

3.1. Routing of INVITE and MESSAGE to Different UAs


(2)  ['The' --> 'They']

In Section 2, the second paragraph on page 6 says:

   A caller may actually have a wide variety of preferences for how a
   call should be routed.  They may prefer to go right to voicemail.
|  They may prefer never to reach voicemail.  The may prefer to reach
   the user on a device that supports video (because a video-conference
   is desired).  They may wish to reach a device that has an attendant
   who can answer if the user is not there.

It should say:

   A caller may actually have a wide variety of preferences for how a
   call should be routed.  They may prefer to go right to voicemail.
|  They may prefer never to reach voicemail.  They may prefer to reach
   the user on a device that supports video (because a video-conference
   is desired).  They may wish to reach a device that has an attendant
   who can answer if the user is not there.


(3)  [word omission]

Section 3.5.1, at the bottom of page 13, says:

   X sends an invitation to Y to initiate an audio/video call, including
   both m=audio and m=video lines in the SDP.  AOR Y has two contacts,
   Y1 and Y2.  Y1 represents a normal audio phone, where Y prefers to
   receive their calls.  It will answer an audio/video call, refusing
|  the video.  Y2 represents an audio/video phone that should only used
   when needed.  The caller really wants the call answered by a device
   that supports video, but will accept an audio-only call as a second
   choice.

It should say:

   X sends an invitation to Y to initiate an audio/video call, including
   both m=audio and m=video lines in the SDP.  AOR Y has two contacts,
   Y1 and Y2.  Y1 represents a normal audio phone, where Y prefers to
   receive their calls.  It will answer an audio/video call, refusing
|  the video.  Y2 represents an audio/video phone that should only be
   used when needed.  The caller really wants the call answered by a
   device that supports video, but will accept an audio-only call as a
   second choice.


These textual flaws might be included in an RFC Errata Note.

Best regrads,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
studying the recently published RFC 4586 (AVPF Timing Rules
Simulation Results) authored by you, I found two textual flaws
I would like to report.

Below, I use change bars ('|' in column 1) and tag lines to mark
issues / changes.


(1)  [significant typo]

In Section 4.1 of RFC 4586, the text just below Table 1, on page 8,
says:

   We can see that in configurations where both agents use the new
   timing rules each of them uses, at most, about 2.5% of the session
|  bandwidth for RTP, which sums up to 5% of the session bandwidth for
   both.  [...]

It should say:

   We can see that in configurations where both agents use the new
   timing rules each of them uses, at most, about 2.5% of the session
|  bandwidth for RTCP, which sums up to 5% of the session bandwidth for
   both.  [...]

Rationale:  Apparent from the context!


(2)  [missing article]

Section 7.3 of RFC 4585, on page 24, says:

|  We have shown that the limitations of RTP AVPF profile do not
   generate such high delay in the feedback messages that the
   performance of NEWPRED is degraded for sessions from 32 kbps to 2
   Mbps.  [...]

It should say:

|  We have shown that the limitations of the RTP AVPF profile do not
   generate such high delay in the feedback messages that the
   performance of NEWPRED is degraded for sessions from 32 kbps to 2
   Mbps.  [...]


IMHO, at least item (1) above, but preferrrably item (2) as well,
should be addressed by posting an RFC Errata Note for RFC 4586.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
studying the recently published RFC 4585 (RTP/AVPF profile)
authored by you, I found a couple of textual issues I'd like
to report to you for further consideration.

Below, I use change bars ('|' in column 1) and tag lines to mark
issues / changes.  Proposed (changed) text is re-adjusted to conform
with RFC formatting rules, where necessary.


(1)

Section 1.1 of RFC 4585, on mid-page 4, says:

   Feedback (FB) message:
      An RTCP message as defined in this document is used to convey
      information about events observed at a receiver -- in addition to
      long-term receiver status information that is carried in RTCP
      receiver reports (RRs) -- back to the sender of the media stream.
|     For the sake of clarity, feedback message is referred to as FB
|     message throughout this document.

I do not see how and why using the abbreviation might have improved
*clarity* of the text; apparently, it has been used for *brevity* .
Therefore, the two tagged lines should better say:

|     For the sake of brevity, feedback message is referred to as FB
|     message throughout this document.

Similarly, at the bottom of page 4, where the RFC says:

   Feedback (FB) threshold:
      The FB threshold indicates the transition between Immediate
      Feedback and Early RTCP mode.  [...]
      [...]
      to application designers and is not used in any calculations.  For
|     the sake of clarity, the term feedback threshold is referred to as
      FB threshold throughout this document.

The last 3 lines should better say:

      to application designers and is not used in any calculations.  For
|     the sake of brevity, the term feedback threshold is referred to as
      FB threshold throughout this document.


(2)

The first bulleted item in Section 3.1, on page 7, says:
                                                    vvvvvvvvvvvvv
|  o  Status reports are contained in sender report (SR)/received report
      (RR) packets and are transmitted at regular intervals as part of
      compound RTCP packets (which also include source description
      (SDES) and possibly other messages); these status reports provide
      an overall indication for the recent reception quality of a media
      stream.

For *clarity*, it perhaps should better say -- not binding together the
words intended to being separated by the slash marking the alternative:
                                                        vvv
|  o  Status reports are contained in sender report (SR) / received
      report (RR) packets and are transmitted at regular intervals as
      part of compound RTCP packets (which also include source
      description (SDES) and possibly other messages); these status
      reports provide an overall indication for the recent reception
      quality of a media stream.


(3)  [missing article]

In Section 3.4, on mid-page 11, RFC 4585 says:

   j) Let T_fd be the actual (randomized) delay for the transmission of
      FB message in response to an event at time t0.

It should say:

   j) Let T_fd be the actual (randomized) delay for the transmission of
|     a FB message in response to an event at time t0.
      ^^

(4)  [inappropriate wording]

The algorithm in Section 3.5.2, at the bottom of page 16, contains
the sub-step:

      4b) If allow_early == TRUE, then R MUST schedule an Early RTCP
          packet for te = t0 + RND * T_dither_max with RND being a
|         pseudo random function evenly distributed between 0 and 1.
                        ^^^^^^^^

This wording is inappropriate.  RND is not a *function* (that's code!),
but a *number*, the function *value*.  Therefore, the RFC should say:

      4b) If allow_early == TRUE, then R MUST schedule an Early RTCP
          packet for te = t0 + RND * T_dither_max with RND being a
|         pseudo random number evenly distributed between 0 and 1.
                        ^^^^^^


(5)  [inappropriate wording]

The algorithm in Section 3.5.3, at the top of page 19, says:

   2. Otherwise, a temporary value T_rr_current_interval is calculated
      as follows:

         T_rr_current_interval = RND*T_rr_interval

|     with RND being a pseudo random function evenly distributed between
      0.5 and 1.5.  This dithered value is used to determine one of the
      following alternatives:

Similar to item (4) above, the RFC should say instead:

   2. Otherwise, a temporary value T_rr_current_interval is calculated
      as follows:

         T_rr_current_interval = RND*T_rr_interval

|     with RND being a pseudo random number evenly distributed between
      0.5 and 1.5.  This dithered value is used to determine one of the
      following alternatives:


(6)  [typo / dup. wording]

Section 3.6.2 of RFC 4585, on mid-page 21, says:

   Example: If a 256-kbit/s video with 30 fps is transmitted through a
   network with an MTU size of some 1,500 bytes, then, in most cases,
|  each frame would fit in into one packet leading to a packet rate of
   30 packets per second.  [...]

It should say:

   Example: If a 256-kbit/s video with 30 fps is transmitted through a
   network with an MTU size of some 1,500 bytes, then, in most cases,
|  each frame would fit into one packet leading to a packet rate of
   30 packets per second.  [...]


(7)  [wrong ref. tag]

On mid-page 23, Section 4.1 of RFC 4585 says:

                             vvv
|  The AV profile defined in [4] is referred to as "AVP" in the context
   of, e.g., the Session Description Protocol (SDP) [3].  The profile
   specified in this document is referred to as "AVPF".

There apparently is a confusion of the ref. tags used.
The RFC should say:
                             vvv
|  The AV profile defined in [2] is referred to as "AVP" in the context
   of, e.g., the Session Description Protocol (SDP) [3].  The profile
   specified in this document is referred to as "AVPF".


(8)  [missing article]

In Section 4.2, near the top of page 25, the ABNF production:

      rtcp-fb-pt         = "*"   ; wildcard: applies to all formats
|                        / fmt   ; as defined in SDP spec

should better say, improving the ABNF comment text:

      rtcp-fb-pt         = "*"   ; wildcard: applies to all formats
|                        / fmt   ; as defined in the SDP spec
                                                ^^^^^


(9)  [inconsistent specification]

In Section 4.2, the ABNF on page 25 contains the following productions:

      rtcp-fb-val        = "ack" rtcp-fb-ack-param
                         / [...]
and
      rtcp-fb-ack-param  = SP "rpsi"
                         / SP "app" [SP byte-string]
                         / SP token [SP byte-string]
|                        / ; empty

This means that the feedback type "ack" *MAY* have parameters.

Contrary to that, below the ABNF, the RFC explains:

   Feedback type "ack":

      This feedback type indicates that positive acknowledgements for
      feedback are supported.

      The feedback type "ack" MUST only be used if the media session is
      allowed to operate in ACK mode as defined in Section 3.6.1.

|     Parameters MUST be provided to further distinguish different types
|     of positive acknowledgement feedback.

      [...]

The *MUST* in the tagged lines contradicts the ABNF.

Authors, please resolve the issue:

Either have the ABNF changed by omission of the tagged line above,

|                        / ; empty

or change the tagged explanation lines to say:

|     Parameters MAY be provided to further distinguish different types
|     of positive acknowledgement feedback.


(10)  [incomplete specification, and an extraneous word]

At the bottom of page 26, Section 4.2 of RFC 4585 says:

   Other feedback types <rtcp-fb-id>:

      Other documents MAY define additional types of feedback; to keep
      the grammar extensible for those cases, the rtcp-fb-id is
|     introduced as a placeholder.  A new feedback scheme name MUST to
      be unique (and thus MUST be registered with IANA).  Along with a
|     new name, its semantics, packet formats (if necessary), and rules
      for its operation MUST be specified.

It should say:

   Other feedback types <rtcp-fb-id>:

      Other documents MAY define additional types of feedback; to keep
      the grammar extensible for those cases, the rtcp-fb-id is
|     introduced as a placeholder.  A new feedback scheme name MUST be
      unique (and thus MUST be registered with IANA).  Along with a new
|     new name, its semantics, possible parameters, packet formats (if
      necessary), and rules for its operation MUST be specified.

Rationale:

a) "MUST to be unique" should be "MUST be unique".

b) Syntax and semantics of parameters (if any) obviously MUST be
   specified as well.  The RFC text in the IANA Considerations
   (Section 9) already reflects this requirement.
   For completeness and clarity, it should be stated here as well.
   I have proposed minimal additional wording -- you might choose
   alternative words.


(11)  [formatting issue]

In Section 6, the text around the page break from page 31 to page 32
is not formatted properly.
The RFC says:

      [...]
      audio and DTMF) or when codec changes occur, the payload type
      information may need to be conveyed explicitly as part of the FB
      message.  This applies to all
 << page break >>
      payload-specific as well as application layer FB messages.  It is
      up to the specification of an FB message to define how payload
      type information is transmitted.

It should say:

(12)  [inconsistent text]

Still in Section 6, the second paragraph on page 32 (immediately
following the text quotation in item (11) above) says:

                         vvv
|  This document defines two transport layer and three (video) payload-
   specific FB messages as well as a single container for application
   layer FB messages.  Additional transport layer and payload-specific
   FB messages MAY be defined in other documents and MUST be registered
   through IANA (see Section 9, "IANA Considerations").

It should say:
                         vvv
|  This document defines one transport layer and three (video) payload-
   specific FB messages as well as a single container for application
   layer FB messages.  Additional transport layer and payload-specific
   FB messages MAY be defined in other documents and MUST be registered
   through IANA (see Section 9, "IANA Considerations").

Rationale:
Cf. the third paragraph of Section 6, on page 31, and
the subsequent pages, in particular page 34, where the
second paragraph of Section 6.2 says:

|  A single general purpose transport layer FB message is defined in
   this document: Generic NACK.  It is identified by means of the FMT
   parameter as follows:

   [...]

(And so it does, per Section 6.2.1.)


(13)  [incomplete specification?]

Within Section 6.1, the last paragraph on page 33 says:

   Each RTCP feedback packet MUST contain at least one FB message in the
   FCI field.  Sections 6.2 and 6.3 define for each FCI type, whether or
   not multiple FB messages MAY be compressed into a single FCI field.
|  If this is the case, they MUST be of the same type, i.e., same FMT.
|  If multiple types of feedback messages, i.e., several FMTs, need to
   be conveyed, then several RTCP FB messages MUST be generated and
   SHOULD be concatenated in the same compound RTCP packet.

I strongly suspect -- and this is supported by the examples in the
RFC -- that feedback packets to be combined MUST also have the same
payload type (PT), not only agree in their FMT values.
Otherwise, there would be no way to carry the different PT values
in the FB message according to the format specified in Figure 3.

Therefore, the RFC should say:

   Each RTCP feedback packet MUST contain at least one FB message in the
   FCI field.  Sections 6.2 and 6.3 define for each FCI type, whether or
   not multiple FB messages MAY be compressed into a single FCI field.
|  If this is the case, they MUST be of the same type, i.e., same PT and
|  the same FMT.  If multiple types of feedback messages, i.e., several
|  PTs and/or several FMTs, need to be conveyed, then several RTCP FB
   messages MUST be generated and SHOULD be concatenated in the same
   compound RTCP packet.

(Authors, please supply alternative wording, if you desire.)

Note:
Perhaps, this issue arised because of the slightly differing
semantics implied for the various usages of the term "FB message"
in Section 6.1 -- (a) the whole RTCP FB message, and (b) a semantic
entity carried in the FCI field of that RTCP message.
Future updates to the RFC might try further clarifications of the
text to avoid this subtle sematic overloading.


(14)  [missing article]

The last paragraph of Section 6.3, at the bottom of page 35, says:

   The following subsections define the FCI formats for the payload-
|  specific FB messages, Section 6.4 defines FCI format for the
   application layer FB message.

It should say:

   The following subsections define the FCI formats for the payload-
|  specific FB messages, Section 6.4 defines the FCI format for the
   application layer FB message.


(15)  [extraneous words]

The second paragraph of Section 6.3.1.1, on page 36, says:

   Other RTP payload specifications such as RFC 2032 [6] already define
|  a feedback mechanism for some for certain codecs.  An application
   supporting both schemes MUST use the feedback mechanism defined in
   this specification when sending feedback.  For backward compatibility
   reasons, such an application SHOULD also be capable to receive and
   react to the feedback scheme defined in the respective RTP payload
   format, if this is required by that payload format.

It should say:

   Other RTP payload specifications such as RFC 2032 [6] already define
|  a feedback mechanism for certain codecs.  An application supporting
   both schemes MUST use the feedback mechanism defined in this
   specification when sending feedback.  For backward compatibility
   reasons, such an application SHOULD also be capable to receive and
   react to the feedback scheme defined in the respective RTP payload
   format, if this is required by that payload format.


(16)  [misleading wording]

The first paragraph of Section 6.3.2.2, on page 37, says:

                                                     vvvvv
|  The Slice Loss Indication uses one additional FCI field, the content
   of which is depicted in Figure 6.  The length of the FB message MUST
   be set to 2+n, with n being the number of SLIs contained in the FCI
   field.

To avoid the semantic overloading of the word "field", it should
perhaps better say:
                                                     vvvv
|  The Slice Loss Indication uses one additional FCI word, the content
   of which is depicted in Figure 6.  The length of the FB message MUST
   be set to 2+n, with n being the number of SLIs contained in the FCI
   field.


(17)  [typo]

The first paragraph of Section 6.3.3.1, on page 39, says:

                             v
                                   [...].  As this reference picture is
|  temporally further away then usual, the resulting predictively coded
   picture will use more bits.

It should say:
                             v
                                   [...].  As this reference picture is
|  temporally further away than usual, the resulting predictively coded
   picture will use more bits.


(18)  [inappropriate wording]

The first paragraph of Section 8, on page 42, says:

   RTP packets transporting information with the proposed payload format
   are subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP
   specification [1] and in the RTP/AVP profile specification [2].  This
   profile does not specify any additional security services.

The wording of the first sentence is inappropriate for this RFC.
(It perhaps has been copied unchanged from an RFC with an RTP Payload
specification.)

RFC 4585 should say instead:

|  RTP packets transporting information as defined in various payload
|  formats supporting this profile are subject to the security
   considerations discussed in the RTP specification [1] and in the
   RTP/AVP profile specification [2].  This profile does not specify any
   additional security services.


(19)  [redundant Ref.]

The Normative Reference [7] (in Section 11.1, on page 48) and
the Informative Reference [20] (in Section 11.2, on page 49)
both point to RFC 3448.
([7] and [20] are referred to once each in the RFC text.)

This is unusual and unexpected.  Only one pointer to RFC 3448
should have been specified.  Authors, please check.


Authors, please verify, and/or comment on, these items.
I propose that you resolve the open issues (as noted above) and
compile an Author's RFC Errata Note for RFC 4585 to be posted to
the RFC Editor's RFC Errata web pages, making freely use of the
material supplied above.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hi there,
I wish to submit an errata for RFC4234 - I communicated these to the =
authors, however they asked me to submit the errata.

Suspected errors:
(1)
3.4.  Value Range Alternatives:  %c##-##

   A range of alternative numeric values can be specified compactly,
   using dash ("-") to indicate the range of alternative values.  Hence:

         DIGIT       =3D  %x30-39

   is equivalent to:

         DIGIT       =3D  "0" / "1" / "2" / "3" / "4" / "5" / "6" /

                        "7" / "8" / "9"
The word equivalent is correct only when US-ASCII character set is used, =
since:
DIGIT       =3D  %x30-39 ; means any hexadecimal value between 0x30 and =
0x39, while
DIGIT       =3D  "0" / "1" / "2" / "3" / "4" / "5" / "6" / "7" / "8" / =
"9" ; means any digit from 0 thru 9.

(2)
         CHAR           =3D  %x01-7F
                                ; any 7-bit US-ASCII character,
                                ;  excluding NUL
NUL is not defined.

Suggestions:
(1)
Re-write the document in a character-encoding-independent manner.
(2)
Add definition of NUL (or NULL) as terminating null character - watch =
out for character encoding!
(3)
Add definition of NOTNULL as any character but terminating null =
character - watch out for character encoding!

Thank You.

RFC793 should acknowledge in "Errata" this note posted in RFC1122:

ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc1122.txt

 4.2.2.8  TCP Connection State Diagram: RFC-793 Section 3.2,
    page 23

    There are several problems with this diagram:

    (a)  The arrow from SYN-SENT to SYN-RCVD should be labeled
         with "snd SYN,ACK", to agree with the text on page 68
         and with Figure 8.

Either RFC1122 is wrong (in which case *it* needs an Errata entry), or
RFC793 is wrong, in which case *it* needs an Errata entry.  They can't
both be right!

At the very least, pending expert opinion on which document is correct,
you as editor would do the world a service by giving *both* documents
an Errata note mentioning the blatant protocol conflict.

Because of the above protocol diagram change given in RFC1122 (and others
in the same section), RFC1122 should also be mentioned as "updating"
RFC793, and RFC793 should be documented as being "updated by" RFC1122.

In the email below, Carlo Bellettini points out an error in RFC 4436 
Section 2.1.1.   The text is given below:

"  If a valid ARP Reply is received, the MAC address in the sender
   hardware address field (ar$sha) in the ARP Reply is matched against
   the target hardware address field (ar$tpa) in the ARP Request, and
   the IPv4 address in the sender protocol address field (ar$spa) of the
   ARP Reply is matched against the target protocol address field
   (ar$tpa) in the ARP Request."

I would like to submit an errata to correct this paragraph so as to 
state the following:

"  If a valid ARP Reply is received, the MAC address in the sender
   hardware address field (ar$sha) in the ARP Reply is matched against
   the destination MAC address in the ARP Request, and the IPv4
   address in the sender protocol address field (ar$spa) of the
   ARP Reply is matched against the target protocol address field
   (ar$tpa) in the ARP Request."

Subject: Clarification on RFC 4436 (DNAv4)

Dear Mr Aboba,
I'm writing my MSc thesis on dual-stack mobility and DNAv4 is one of the
discussed issues. I think there are some typos in RFC 4436, 2.1.1:

   ...
   address as the destination.  The host includes its MAC address in the
   sender hardware address field (ar$sha) and sets the target hardware
   address field (ar$tha) to 0.

   If a valid ARP Reply is received, the MAC address in the sender
   hardware address field (ar$sha) in the ARP Reply is matched against
   the target hardware address field (ar$tpa) in the ARP Request, and
   ...

Maybe in the last line I cited there should be "ar$tha" instead of
"ar$tpa", is this correct? (ar$tpa is here a IP address) If so, I can't
see how can the mobile node match ar$sha in the ARP Reply against ar$tha
in the ARP Request, since the latter must be set to 0. Thank you,

Carlo Bellettini

(should I contact some other author?)

Dear Sir

There is a mistype error in RFC 3404 (Section 5.1,  p. 9) - wrong 
reference to RFC 3404 (must be RFC 3403)

Errored text is:

There is opportunity for significant optimization here.  RFC 3404
    defines that Additional Information section may be available.  In
    this case the the SRV records may be returned as additional
    information for terminal NAPTRs lookups (as well as the A records for
    those SRVs).  This is a significant optimization.

Correct text is:

There is opportunity for significant optimization here.  RFC 3403
    defines that Additional Information section may be available.  In
    this case the the SRV records may be returned as additional

Dear RFC Editor,

I would like to bring to your notice some formatting error in RFC2516 - A Method for Transmitting PPP Over Ethernet (PPPoE).

Page 8:

Line#426:    Host MAC address using a key known only to the Access > Concentrator.

There is an unnecessary ">" symbol.

Line#427 to 429:

   While the AC-Cookie is useful against some DOS attacks, it can not
   protect against all DOS attacks and an Access Concentrator MAY employ
   other means to protect resources.

It has been repeated again in Line#431 to 433.

Hope it will be corrected in future version of the RFC if any.  Or at least will be posted as an errata in the rfc-editor website.

Hello,
reading the recently published RFC 4650 (MIKEY DHHMAC), I found
a couple of textual flaws that might be noted as RFC errata.

The items below are presented in textual order of occurrence.
Only items (14) and (15) below are considered serious.


(1) word omission

In Section 1, the first text line on page 2 says:

   There is work done in IETF to develop key management schemes.  [..]

It should say:

|  There is work done in the IETF to develop key management schemes.
   [..]


(2) typo

In Section 1, the last indented paragraph on page 4 says:

      However, the Diffie-Hellman key agreement protocol is known for
      its subtle security strengths in that it is able to provide full
      perfect forward secrecy (PFS) and further have to both parties
      actively involved in session key generation.  This special
      security property (despite the somewhat higher computational
      costs) makes Diffie-Hellman techniques attractive in practice.

It should say:

      However, the Diffie-Hellman key agreement protocol is known for
      its subtle security strengths in that it is able to provide full
|     perfect forward secrecy (PFS) and further have both parties
      actively involved in session key generation.  This special
      security property (despite the somewhat higher computational
      costs) makes Diffie-Hellman techniques attractive in practice.


(3) typo (line folding problem?)

The second paragraph of Section 2, on page 7, says:

   DHHMAC is applicable in a peer-to-peer group where no access to a
   public-key infrastructure can be assumed to be available.  Rather,
   pre- shared master secrets are assumed to be available among the
   entities in such an environment.

It should say:

   DHHMAC is applicable in a peer-to-peer group where no access to a
   public-key infrastructure can be assumed to be available.  Rather,
|  pre-shared master secrets are assumed to be available among the
   entities in such an environment.


(4) typo

In Section 2.1, the last paragraph on page 7 says:

   a) SIP [13] and SDP, where the encoded MIKEY messages are
      encapsulated and transported in SDP containers of the SDP
      offer/answer see RFC 3264 [27]) handshake, as described in [4];

It should say:

   a) SIP [13] and SDP, where the encoded MIKEY messages are
      encapsulated and transported in SDP containers of the SDP
|     offer/answer (see RFC 3264 [27]) handshake, as described in [4];

or perhaps even better:

   a) SIP [13] and SDP, where the encoded MIKEY messages are
      encapsulated and transported in SDP containers of the SDP
|     offer/answer handshake (see RFC 3264 [27]), as described in [4];


(5) message syntax notation

Figure 1 in Section 3, on page 8, says:

               Initiator                        Responder

   I_message = HDR, T, RAND, [IDi], IDr,
               {SP}, DHi, KEMAC
                    ----------------------->   R_message = HDR, T,
                                                [IDr], IDi, DHr,
                                                DHi, KEMAC
                    <----------------------

To avoid optional empty protocol elements,
it should perhaps better say:

               Initiator                        Responder

|  I_message = HDR, T, RAND, [IDi,] IDr,
               {SP}, DHi, KEMAC
                    ----------------------->   R_message = HDR, T,
|                                               [IDr,] IDi, DHr,
                                                DHi, KEMAC
                    <----------------------

(5')

 Similar corrections would be suitable in Section 3.1 for Figure 2,
on page 10.


(6) missing comma, causing possible mis-interpretation

The last sentence of Section 3, at the bottom of page 9, says:

                                        [...].  The HMAC SHALL be
   computed over the entire message, excluding the MAC field using
   auth_key; see also section 4.2.

It should say:

                                        [...].  The HMAC SHALL be
|  computed over the entire message, excluding the MAC field, using
   auth_key; see also section 4.2.

or perhaps even better and clearer:

                                        [...].  The HMAC SHALL be
|  computed (using auth_key) over the entire message excluding the MAC
|  field; see also section 4.2.


(7) extraneous (duplicate) word

In Section 4.1, the last sentence on page 11, says:

   Other defined next payload values defined in [2] SHALL not be applied
   to DHHMAC.

It should say:

|  Other next payload values defined in [2] SHALL not be applied to
   DHHMAC.

(8) missing comma, causing possible mis-interpretation
    [similar to item (6) above]

The last sentence of the second paragraph of Section 4.2,
on page 12, says:

          [...].  The HMAC is then calculated over the entire MIKEY
   message, excluding the MAC field using auth_key as described in [2]
   section 5.2, and then stored within the MAC field.

It should say:

          [...].  The HMAC is then calculated over the entire MIKEY
|  message, excluding the MAC field, using auth_key as described in [2]
   section 5.2, and then stored within the MAC field.

or perhaps even better and clearer:

|         [...].  The HMAC is then calculated using auth_key, over the
|  entire MIKEY message, excluding the MAC field, as described in [2]
   section 5.2, and then stored within the MAC field.


(9) missing article

The last paragraph on page 13, i.e. the 2nd bullet in Section 5.2, says:

   * Eavesdropping of other, transmitted keying information: DHHMAC
     protocol does not explicitly transmit the TGK at all.  [...]

It should say:

|  * Eavesdropping of other, transmitted keying information: The DHHMAC
     protocol does not explicitly transmit the TGK at all.  [...]


(10) missing "/"

The 3rd paragraph on page 14, i.e. the 4th bullet in Section 5.2, says:

   * Man-in-the-middle attacks: Such attacks threaten the security of
     exchanged, non-authenticated messages.  Man-in-the-middle attacks
     usually come with masquerade and or loss of message integrity (see
     below).  [...]

It should say:

   * Man-in-the-middle attacks: Such attacks threaten the security of
     exchanged, non-authenticated messages.  Man-in-the-middle attacks
|    usually come with masquerade and/or loss of message integrity (see
     below).  [...]


(11) missing comma (potential for mis-interpretation)

The second paragraph on page 15 (within Section 5.2) says:

   * Identity protection: Like MIKEY, identity protection is not a major
     design requirement for MIKEY-DHHMAC, either; see [2].  No security
     protocol is known so far that is able to provide the objectives of
     DHHMAC as stated in section 5.3, including identity protection
     within just a single roundtrip.  [...]

It should say:

   * Identity protection: Like MIKEY, identity protection is not a major
     design requirement for MIKEY-DHHMAC, either; see [2].  No security
     protocol is known so far that is able to provide the objectives of
|    DHHMAC as stated in section 5.3, including identity protection,
     within just a single roundtrip.  [...]


(12) extraneous word

The 3rd paragraph on page 18 (within Section 5.3) says:

     If a very high security level is desired for long-term secrecy of
     the negotiated Diffie-Hellman shared secret, longer hash values may
     be deployed, such as SHA256, SHA384, or SHA512 provide, possibly in
|    conjunction with stronger Diffie-Hellman groups.  This is left as
     for further study.

It should say:
     
|                                              [...].  This is left for
     further study.


(13) extraneous words (left over from changing the sentence?)

The last lines on page 18 (within Section 5.3) say:

     Public-key infrastructures may not always be available in certain
     environments, nor may they be deemed adequate for real-time
     multimedia applications when additional steps are taken for
     certificate validation and certificate revocation methods with
     additional roundtrips into account.

The RFC should say:

     Public-key infrastructures may not always be available in certain
     environments, nor may they be deemed adequate for real-time
     multimedia applications when additional steps are taken for
     certificate validation and certificate revocation methods with
     additional roundtrips.


(14) outdated Informative Reference

Once more: This RFC as well references the now-outdated RFC 1750.
All new RFCs should refer to BCP 106, RFC 4086, instead of RFC 1750!

Item [8] in Section 8.2, at the bottom of page 22 of RFC 4650,
should be replaced by the proper RFC-style citation for RFC 4086.


(15) typo -- results in wrong Endpoint identifier specified

The 3rd paragraph of Appendix A, on page 25, says:

   To establish a call, it is assumed that endpoint B has obtained
   permission from the gatekeeper (not shown).  Endpoint B as the caller
   builds the MIKEY-DHHMAC I_message (see section 3) and sends the
   I_message encapsulated within the H.323-SETUP to endpoint A.  A
|  routing gatekeeper (GK) would forward this message to endpoint B; in
   case of a non-routing gatekeeper, endpoint B sends the SETUP directly
   to endpoint A.  [...]

It should say:

   To establish a call, it is assumed that endpoint B has obtained
   permission from the gatekeeper (not shown).  Endpoint B as the caller
   builds the MIKEY-DHHMAC I_message (see section 3) and sends the
   I_message encapsulated within the H.323-SETUP to endpoint A.  A

   case of a non-routing gatekeeper, endpoint B sends the SETUP directly

Hello,
reading the recently published RFC 4641 (DNSSEC Operational Practices)
authored by you, I unfortunately found two distorting formatting
errors, and two typos as well:


(1)  ill-formatted table in Section 4.2.1.1

At mid-page 15, RFC 4641 says:

   Pre-publish key rollover involves four stages as follows:

      ----------------------------------------------------------------
      initial         new DNSKEY       new RRSIGs      DNSKEY removal
      ----------------------------------------------------------------
      SOA0            SOA1             SOA2            SOA3
      RRSIG10(SOA0)   RRSIG10(SOA1)    RRSIG11(SOA2)   RRSIG11(SOA3)

      DNSKEY1         DNSKEY1          DNSKEY1         DNSKEY1
      DNSKEY10        DNSKEY10         DNSKEY10        DNSKEY11
      DNSKEY11         DNSKEY11
      RRSIG1 (DNSKEY) RRSIG1 (DNSKEY)  RRSIG1(DNSKEY)  RRSIG1 (DNSKEY)
      RRSIG10(DNSKEY) RRSIG10(DNSKEY)  RRSIG11(DNSKEY) RRSIG11(DNSKEY)
      ----------------------------------------------------------------

                         Pre-Publish Key Rollover

It should say:

   Pre-publish key rollover involves four stages as follows:

      ----------------------------------------------------------------
      initial         new DNSKEY       new RRSIGs      DNSKEY removal
      ----------------------------------------------------------------
      SOA0            SOA1             SOA2            SOA3
      RRSIG10(SOA0)   RRSIG10(SOA1)    RRSIG11(SOA2)   RRSIG11(SOA3)

      DNSKEY1         DNSKEY1          DNSKEY1         DNSKEY1

      RRSIG10(DNSKEY) RRSIG10(DNSKEY)  RRSIG11(DNSKEY) RRSIG11(DNSKEY)
      ----------------------------------------------------------------

                         Pre-Publish Key Rollover

Rationale: The mis-alignment of the indicated line breaks the intended
presentation of the procedure; cf. subsequent RFC text.


(2)  ill-formatted table in Section 4.2.1.2

At mid-page 17, RFC 4641 says:

   Double signature ZSK rollover involves three stages as follows:

      ----------------------------------------------------------------
      initial             new DNSKEY         DNSKEY removal
      ----------------------------------------------------------------
      SOA0                SOA1               SOA2
      RRSIG10(SOA0)       RRSIG10(SOA1)      RRSIG11(SOA2)
      RRSIG11(SOA1)

      DNSKEY1             DNSKEY1            DNSKEY1
      DNSKEY10            DNSKEY10           DNSKEY11
      DNSKEY11
      RRSIG1(DNSKEY)      RRSIG1(DNSKEY)     RRSIG1(DNSKEY)
      RRSIG10(DNSKEY)     RRSIG10(DNSKEY)    RRSIG11(DNSKEY)
      RRSIG11(DNSKEY)
      ----------------------------------------------------------------

                Double Signature Zone Signing Key Rollover

It should say:

   Double signature ZSK rollover involves three stages as follows:

      ----------------------------------------------------------------
      initial             new DNSKEY         DNSKEY removal
      ----------------------------------------------------------------
      SOA0                SOA1               SOA2
      RRSIG10(SOA0)       RRSIG10(SOA1)      RRSIG11(SOA2)

      RRSIG10(DNSKEY)     RRSIG10(DNSKEY)    RRSIG11(DNSKEY)
      RRSIG11(DNSKEY)
      ----------------------------------------------------------------

                Double Signature Zone Signing Key Rollover

Rationale: The mis-alignment of the indicated 2 lines breaks the
intended presentation of the procedure; cf. subsequent RFC text.


(3)  typo: 'then' --> 'than'

On page 9, the 1st paragraph of Section 3.5 says:

   When choosing key sizes, zone administrators will need to take into
   account how long a key will be used, how much data will be signed
   during the key publication period (see Section 8.10 of [17]), and,
   optionally, how large the key size of the parent is.  As the chain of
   trust really is "a chain", there is not much sense in making one of
   the keys in the chain several times larger then the others.  [...]

It should say:

   When choosing key sizes, zone administrators will need to take into
   account how long a key will be used, how much data will be signed
   during the key publication period (see Section 8.10 of [17]), and,
   optionally, how large the key size of the parent is.  As the chain of
   trust really is "a chain", there is not much sense in making one of
|  the keys in the chain several times larger than the others.  [...]


(4) missing article

The 2nd paragraph on page 18, within Section 4.2.1.2, says:

   Making sure that the "new DNSKEY" phase lasts until the signature
   expiration time of the data in initial version of the zone is
   recommended.  [...]

It should say:

   Making sure that the "new DNSKEY" phase lasts until the signature
|  expiration time of the data in the initial version of the zone is
   recommended.  [...]


I strongly recommend to post an RFC Errata Note for RFC 4641,
at least covering itmes (1) and (2) above, to help avoid
 misunderstanding of the text by the former issues.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Dear editor,

I tried sending this to John Klensin directly but am not sure
whether this has in fact reached him, as the address in the
RFC is old and I grabbed the best one I could find online.

From: Mathias Koerber <mathias@koerber.org>
To: john-ietf@jck.com

John,

[ I hope sending to you at this address is ok as the one quoted in
the RFC is no longer valid.. ]

it's a bit late, but I found an ambiguity in RFC2821 which I believe
is the result of a simple editing error, and would like your input
as the editor of said RFC...

Specifically (quoting from http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2821.html)


| 4.2.5 Reply Codes After DATA and the Subsequent <CRLF>.<CRLF>
|
|    When an SMTP server returns a positive completion status (2yz code)
|    after the DATA command is completed with <CRLF>.<CRLF>, it accepts
|    responsibility for:
|
|    -  delivering the message (if the recipient mailbox exists), or
|
|    -  if attempts to deliver the message fail due to transient
|       conditions, retrying delivery some reasonable number of times at
|       intervals as specified in section 4.5.4.
|
|    -  if attempts to deliver the message fail due to permanent
|       conditions, or if repeated attempts to deliver the message fail
|       due to transient conditions, returning appropriate
notification to
|       the sender of the original message (using the address in the
SMTP
|       MAIL command).
|
|   When an SMTP server returns a permanent error status (5yz) code
after
                                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
I believe this to be a mistake and that it should read 'transient
error status (4xy)' as this paragraph talks about requeuing and the
permanent
case is discussed 2 paragraphs down.

Should that interpretation be correct, is it permitted to issue a
temp-failure after the final '.'?

|    the DATA command is completed with <CRLF>.<CRLF>, it MUST NOT make
|    any subsequent attempt to deliver that message.  The SMTP client
|    retains responsibility for delivery of that message and may either
|    return it to the user or requeue it for a subsequent attempt (see
|    section 4.5.4.1).
|
|    The user who originated the message SHOULD be able to interpret the
|    return of a transient failure status (by mail message or otherwise)
|    as a non-delivery indication, just as a permanent failure would be
|    interpreted.  I.e., if the client SMTP successfully handles these
|    conditions, the user will not receive such a reply.
|
|    When an SMTP server returns a permanent error status (5yz) code
after
|    the DATA command is completely with <CRLF>.<CRLF>, it MUST NOT make
|    any subsequent attempt to deliver the message.  As with temporary
|    error status codes, the SMTP client retains responsibility for the
|    message, but SHOULD not again attempt delivery to the same server
|    without user review and intervention of the message.




This came up in a discussion whether it is legal for a server to
send a transient failure after DATA and the subsequent <CRLF>.<CRLF>

regards
Mathias

Hello,
reading the recently published RFC 4587 (RTP Payload Fmt for H.261)
authored by you, I found a couple of flaws that perhaps should be
addressed by an RFC Errata Note.


(1)  "Updates" relationship missing in RFC header & RFC index

In the Introduction (3rd paragraph on page 3) the RFC says:

   This document obsoletes RFC 2032 and updates the "video/h261" media
   type that was registered in RFC 3555.

Similar wording is in Section 6.1 (see below).

Therefore, I expect that the RFC heading should have been amended
by a "Updates: 3555" line, and that this relationship be visible in
the RFC index.


(2)  Misleading packetization specification

On page 4, in the first paragraph of Section 3.2, RFC 4587 says:

   [..].  The 512-bit frames are then interlaced with an audio stream
   and transmitted over px 64 kbps circuits according to specification
   H.221 [H221].
                        ^^^^^^^^^^

For clarity, it should say:

   [..].  The 512-bit frames are then interlaced with an audio stream
   and transmitted over p x 64 kbps circuits according to specification
   H.221 [H221].
                        ^^^^^^^^^^^

(and/or replace the 'x' by an asterisk, '*' !)

(2')
The same issue recurs on page 15, in the first item of Section 11.1,
the Normative Reference, [H261] .


(3)  Improper frequency specification

According to the applicable ISO standards on Measures and Weights,
there is never a special sign to be written between the numeric value
and the physical unit of any dimensioned physical value.
(Preferrably, there should not even be any white space between.)

Therefore, in Section 4.1 of RFC 4587, at the bottom of page 5,
where the RFC says:

         [...].  For H.261 video streams, the RTP timestamp is based on
|    a 90-kHz clock.  This clock rate is a multiple of the natural H.261
     frame rate (i.e., 30000/1001 or approximately 29.97 Hz).  [...]

it in fact should say:

         [...].  For H.261 video streams, the RTP timestamp is based on
|    a 90 kHz clock.  This clock rate is a multiple of the natural H.261
     frame rate (i.e., 30000/1001 or approximately 29.97 Hz).  [...]

(Rigorous application of the above principles, taking 'bit' as a unit
specification, would also forbid data amount spellings like "512-bit"
in item (2) above!)


(4)  misaligned 'ruler lines' above data format diagrams

According to legacy and current RFC author guidelines, the ruler lines
above the two data format diagrams on page 6 (within Section 4.1):

|      0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

should be indented as follows:

|       0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


(5)  improper wording (2 instances)

Near the top of page 7, the explanations for the (I) and (V) bits
both contain the sentence:

                   vvvvvvv
       [...].  The meaning of this bit should not be changed during the
      course of the RTP session.

This is abuse of language.
The *meaning* of the bit -- i.e., the bit *values* -- is given in the
text preceding the quoted sentence, and thus intrinsically cannot be
changed during the course of the RTP session.
What in fact should not be changed during the RTP session is the
*value* of these bits!

Therefore, the RFC should say (in both places):

                   vvvvv
|      [...].  The value of this bit should not be changed during the
      course of the RTP session.


(6)  typo

In Section 5, on page 9, the last sentence of the bullet (3) says:

                                [...].  This mode is particularly
        efficient in point-to-point connection or when the number of
        decoders is low.

It should say:
                                [...].  This mode is particularly
|       efficient in a point-to-point connection or when the number of
        decoders is low.

or:
                                [...].  This mode is particularly
|       efficient in point-to-point connections or when the number of
        decoders is low.


(7)  misleading section headlines

In the RFC text, Section

  6.  IANA Considerations

contains the following sub-sections:

  6.1.  Media Type Registrations

  6.1.1.  Registration of MIME Media Type video/H261

  6.2.  SDP Parameters

  6.2.1.  Usage with the SDP Offer Answer Model

Only Section 6.1[.1] contains information addressed to the IANA.
Therefore, for clarity (and to avoid undue burden for the IANA),
the first two of the headlines quoted above should effectively be
exchanged.  And, there is only one (1) registration!
Hence, singular should be used.

Furthermore, the text of Section 6.1 contains improper wording
and has no trailing fullstop (dot) character:

|  This section describes the media types and names associated with this
|  payload format.  The section updates the previous registered version
   in RFC 3555 [RFC3555].  This registration uses the template defined
|  in RFC 4288 [RFC4288]

Thus, the headline

6.  IANA Considerations

should be corrected to say, e.g.:

6.  Media Type video/H261

and

6.1.  Media Type Registrations

   [... paragraph quoted above ... ]

should be replaced by:

6.1  IANA Considerations

|  This section describes the media type and parameters associated with
|  this payload format.  It updates the previous registered version in
   RFC 3555 [RFC3555].  This registration uses the template defined
|  in RFC 4288 [RFC4288].


(8)  typo

The last sentence (of the last bullet) of Section 6.2, on page 12,
says:
                                     [...].  These parameters are
      expressed as a MIME media type string, in the form of as a
      semicolon-separated list of parameters
                                                           ^^^^
It should say:
                                     [...].  These parameters are
|     expressed as a MIME media type string, in the form of a
      semicolon-separated list of parameters


(9)  typo and misleading wording in Section 6.2.1

The first paragraph of Section 6.2.1, on page 12, says:

   When H.261 is offered over RTP using SDP in an Offer/Answer model
   [RFC3264] the following considerations are necessary.

This could easily be misunderstood as talking about an
'SDP offer over RTP'.
The RFC should say instead (exchanging two pairs of words):

   When H.261 over RTP is offered using SDP in an Offer/Answer model
   [RFC3264] the following considerations are necessary.

Subsequently, the paragraph with the headline "Picture sizes and MPI",

   Supported picture sizes and their corresponding minimum picture
   interval (MPI) information for H.261 can be combined.  All picture
   sizes may be advertised to the other party, or only a subset of it.
   Using the recvonly or sendrev direction attribute, a terminal SHOULD
   announce those picture sizes (with their MPIs) that it is willing to
   receive.  For example, CIF=2 means that receiver can receive a CIF
   picture and that the frame rate SHALL be less then 15 frames per
   second.

Should be corrected and clarified to say:

   Supported picture sizes and their corresponding minimum picture
   interval (MPI) information for H.261 can be combined.  All picture
   sizes may be advertised to the other party, or only a subset of it.
|  Using the recvonly or sendrec direction attribute, a terminal SHOULD
   announce those picture sizes (with their MPIs) that it is willing to
|  receive.  For example, CIF=2 means that the SDP sender can receive a
   CIF picture and that the frame rate SHALL be less then 15 frames per
   second.

(There is no 'sendrev' direction attribute, and it is important to
explicitely differentiate between senders and receivers of SDP and
media, respectively!)

Finally, the second paragraph on page 13,

   An example of media representation in SDP is as follows CIF at 15
   frames per second, QCIF at 30 frames per second and annex D

should better say:

|  An example of media representation in SDP is as follows:
   CIF at 15 frames per second, QCIF at 30 frames per second and annex D

or, perhaps even better:

|  An example of media representation in SDP, for CIF at 15 frames per
|  second, QCIF at 30 frames per second and annex D, is as follows:

Hello,
reading the recently published RFC 4632 (CIDR; BCP 122)
authored by you, I found a couple of flaws worth being noted.
Most issues are pure textual or editorial in nature.


(1)  misleading indentation

In Section 2, on page 4 of RFC 4632, the text after the
enumerated item '3.' up to the end of the section is indented
too much (by 4 columns), making it erroneously appear to belong
to that item '3.'

Where the RFC says:

   3.  Eventual exhaustion of the 32-bit IPv4 address space.

|      It was clear that then-current rates of Internet growth would
|      cause the first two problems to become critical sometime between
|      1993 and 1995.  Work already in progress on topological
|      assignment of addressing for Connectionless Network Service
|      (CLNS), which was presented to the community at the Boulder IETF
|      in December of 1990, led to thoughts on how to re-structure the
|      32-bit IPv4 address space to increase its lifespan.  Work in the
|      ROAD group followed and eventually resulted in the publication of
|      [RFC1338], and later, [RFC1519].

|      The design and deployment of CIDR was intended to solve these
|      problems by providing a mechanism to slow the growth of global
|      routing tables and to reduce the rate of consumption of IPv4
|      address space.  It did not and does not attempt to solve the
|      third problem, which is of a more long-term nature; instead, it
|      endeavors to ease enough of the short- to mid-term difficulties
|      to allow the Internet to continue to function efficiently while
|      progress is made on a longer-term solution.

|      More historical background on this effort and on the ROAD group
|      may be found in [RFC1380] and at [LWRD].

3.  Classless Addressing as a Solution

It should say:

   3.  Eventual exhaustion of the 32-bit IPv4 address space.

(2)  typo (word replication)

In the second paragraph of Section 5.2, at the bottom of page 12,
RFC 4632 says:

                                             [...].  If the "child"
   network were to lose internal connectivity to 192.168.65.0/24 (which
|  is part of its aggregate), traffic from the "parent" to the to the
   "child" destined for 192.168.65.1 will follow the "child's"
   advertised route.  [...]
                                                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
It should say:

                                             [...].  If the "child"
   network were to lose internal connectivity to 192.168.65.0/24 (which
|  is part of its aggregate), traffic from the "parent" to the "child"
   destined for 192.168.65.1 will follow the "child's" advertised route.
   [...]


(3)  garbled sentence

The second paragraph of Section 7, on page 18, says:

   A description of techniques to populate the IN-ADDR.ARPA zone when
   and used address that blocks that do not align to octet boundaries is
   described in [RFC2317].

Apparently, this sentence is garbled; as written, it makes no sense.
Perhaps, it was intended to say:

   A description of techniques to populate the IN-ADDR.ARPA zone when
|  used address blocks do not align to octet boundaries is described in
   [RFC2317].


(4)  typo (singular/plural mismatch)

On page 19, the second enumerated bullet in Section 9 says:

   2.  Acceleration of the exponential trend in late 1993 and early 1994
       as CIDR "supernet" blocks were first assigned by the NIC and
       routed as separate legacy class-C networks by service provider.

It should say:

   2.  Acceleration of the exponential trend in late 1993 and early 1994
       as CIDR "supernet" blocks were first assigned by the NIC and
|      routed as separate legacy class-C networks by service providers.
                                                                     ^


(5)  incomplete status change of legacy documents

Section 11 (pp. 21/22) re-classifies a couple of legacy RFCs as
Historic.
Unfortunately, there are additional documents closely related to
these re-classified documents left alone -- and apparently still
current.
IMHO, it would have been much clearer to also re-classify RFC 1797
and RFC 1879 as Historic, as well.

Note:
Admittedly, there may be a gap in the IETF document maintenance
procedures not formally allowing Informational and Experimental
RFCs to be re-classified as Historic.  If this was the reason for
omitting the named RFCs from Section 11 of RFC 4632, it would
perhaps have been useful to "obsolete" these RFCs by RFC 4632.
This situation is bound to recur with more Informational RFCs
published as companion documents to Standards Track RFCs;
thus, a general procedural solution should be sought to visibly
(in the RFC index) 'outdate' such RFCs when updates get published.


Please comment, and decide on the submission of an RFC Errata Note
to address the above issues -- or some of these.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
in the recently published RFC 4570 (SDP Source Filters)
authored by you, I found a couple of textual flaws that
might be corrected by posting an RFC Errata Note.


(1)  punctuation

Text in Section 1 does not conform to the "rational quoting"
style generally followed in technical/mathematical documents
and stated in all RFC authoring guides.

The second paragraph on page 2 says:

                               [...].  Applications and hosts may also
   share the source-filter information with network elements (e.g., with
   routers using [IGMPv3]) so they can potentially perform the traffic
|  filtering operation further "upstream," closer to the source(s).
                                        ^^

It should say:

                               [...].  Applications and hosts may also
   share the source-filter information with network elements (e.g., with
   routers using [IGMPv3]) so they can potentially perform the traffic
|  filtering operation further "upstream", closer to the source(s).
                                        ^^

(2)  typos (grammar)

The second paragraph of Section 4, at the bottom of page 8, says:

                              [...].  Use of source-filters do not
   corrupt the ASM semantics but provide more control for receivers, at
   their discretion.

It should say:
                                                              vv
|                             [...].  Use of source-filters does not
|  corrupt the ASM semantics but provides more control for receivers, at
   their discretion.
                                        ^

The issue becomes even more apparent when the article is added, as well:

|                             [...].  The use of source-filters does not
|  corrupt the ASM semantics but provides more control for receivers, at
   their discretion.


(3)  improper text in IANA registration template

The filled out SDP attribute registration template in the IANA
Considerations (Section 6) on page 10 contains improper wording
-- either just being garbage (there are no 'registrations below'
in the RFC), or getting inappropriate when extracted from the RFC
and included in a stand-alone IANA document.

At the end of the template, the RFC says:

|       Purpose:            See this document
|       Reference:          This document
|       Values:             See this document, and registrations below

It should say:

|       Purpose:            See RFC 4632
|       Reference:          RFC 4632
|       Values:             See RFC 4632


Please comment.

Preferrably, to address these issues, you should prepare an
Author's Errata Note for RFC 4632, making freely use of the
material presented above, and submit it to the RFC Editor
for publication on the RFC Errata web pages.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
reading the recently published RFC 4567 (Key Mgmt Extn's for
SDP and RTSP), I found a couple of issues and textual flaws
I'd like to report.

In the first part of the list below, I have collected more
significant items, whereas the second part, item (7) ff.,
lists simple textual issues (typos and grammar).


(1)  wrong protocol named in 'Abstract'

In the second paragraph of the Abstract, on page 1, RFC 4567 says:

   General guidelines are also given on how the framework should be used
   together with SIP and RTSP.  The usage with the Multimedia Internet
   KEYing (MIKEY) key management protocol is also defined.

It should say:

   General guidelines are also given on how the framework should be used
|  together with SIP and SAP.  The usage with the Multimedia Internet
   KEYing (MIKEY) key management protocol is also defined.

Rationale: As can be seen from the title and the body of the RFC, and
as has been correctly stated in the first paragraph of the Abstract,
the RFC primarily deals with SDP and RTSP; it "also" considers the use
of the SDP extensions with SIP (Section 4.1.2) and SAP (Section 4.1.3).
Hence, SAP should be mentioned in the second paragraph of the Abstract
instead of RTSP.


(2)  inappropriate text (cut&paste error?)

On page 6, the explanation below the ABNF in Section 3.2 says:

   where KMPID is as defined in Section 3 of this memo, "base64" as
   defined in [SDPnew], and "URI" as defined in Section 3 of [RFC3986].

It should say:

   where KMPID is as defined in Section 3 of this memo and "URI" as
   defined in Section 3 of [RFC3986].

Rationale: "base64" does not appear in the ABNF of Section 3.2 !


(3)  incomplete sentence

The first paragraph of Section 4.1.1, on page 8, says:

   The processing when SDP is used is slightly different according to
   the way SDP is transported, and if it uses an offer/answer or
   announcement.  The processing can be divided into four different
   steps:

It should say:

   The processing when SDP is used is slightly different according to
   the way SDP is transported, and if it uses an offer/answer or
|  announcement model.  The processing can be divided into four
   different steps:


(4)  misleading word omission

Within Section 5.4, the explanation at top of page 21,

   Each RTSP header is inserted in the SETUP related to the audio and
   video separately:

should be clarified to say:

|  A key management RTSP header is inserted in the SETUP related to the
   audio and video separately:


(5)  suspected inconsistency

The last paragraph of Section 7, on page 22, says:

   The server will need to be able to know the identity of the client
   before creating and sending a MIKEY message.  [...]

IMHO, it is not clear how this fits with the text on page 14.
Perhaps, a 3-way handshake with client auth in DESCRIBE could
be considered.


(6)  inconsistency between ABNF and IANA registrations

Perhaps, a late change to the ABNF in the body of the RFC has lead
to inconsistencies in the filled out IANA registration templates
as presented in Section 9.1 and 9.3; in particular, the hypothetical
attribute name "key-mgmt-att-field" referred to in fact should be just
"key-mgmt"; "key-mgmt-att-field" is the name of the ABNF production
rule (introduced in  Section 3.1) for this literal; in the template
the literal name of the attribute is needed.

Therefore:

In Section 9.1, near the bottom of page 25, change

      SDP Attribute Field ("att-field"):

        Name:               key-mgmt-att-field

to say:

      SDP Attribute Field ("att-field"):

        Name:               key-mgmt

and in Section 9.3, on page 26, change

   Purpose:        Usage of MIKEY with the key-mgmt-att-field
                    attribute and the keymgmt RTSP header

to say:

|  Purpose:        Usage of MIKEY with the key-mgmt SDP attribute
                    and the keymgmt RTSP header

[ I also have added "SDP" for additional clarification. ]


(7)  missing articles

The first paragraph of the Abstract, on page 1 of RFC 4567, says:

   This document defines general extensions for Session Description
   Protocol (SDP) and Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) to carry
   messages, as specified by a key management protocol, in order to
   secure the media.  [...]

It should say:

|  This document defines general extensions for the Session Description
|  Protocol (SDP) and the Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) to carry
   messages, as specified by a key management protocol, in order to
   secure the media.  [...]


(8)  missing article

Near the top of page 7, the paragraph,

   We define one new RTSP status code to report error due to any failure
   during the key management processing (Section 4.2):

should say:

|  We define one new RTSP status code to report an error due to any
   failure during the key management processing (Section 4.2):


(9)  missing article

Within Section 4.2, the last bullet on page 15 says:

   * Key management responses for the initial establishment of security
     parameters for an individual media SHALL only be included in SETUP
     for the corresponding media stream.

It should say:

   * Key management responses for the initial establishment of security
|    parameters for an individual media SHALL only be included in the
     SETUP for the corresponding media stream.


(10)  typo (singular/plural mismatch)

Within Section 5.2, the explanation of the example, in the lower
half of page 19,

   The client checks the validity of the received MIKEY message, and, in
   case of successful verification, it accept the message.  [...]

should say:

   The client checks the validity of the received MIKEY message, and, in
|  case of successful verification, it accepts the message.  [...]


Please comment.

Preferrably, to address these issues, you should prepare an
Author's Errata Note for RFC 4567, making freely use of the
material presented above, and submit it to the RFC Editor
for publication on the RFC Errata web pages.

Hello,
reading the recently published RFC 4640 (MIP4 Bootstrapping)
authored by you, I found a couple of issues and textual flaws
I'd like to bring to your attention.


(1)  typo/grammar

On page 3 of RFC 4640, the seconf paragraph of Section 1.2 says:

   Typically, bootstrapping happens when a mobile node does not have all
   the information it needs to set up the Mobile IPv6 service.  This
   includes, but is not limited to, situations in which the mobile node
   does not having any information when it boots up for the first time
   (out of the box), or does not retain any information during reboots.

It should say:

   Typically, bootstrapping happens when a mobile node does not have all
   the information it needs to set up the Mobile IPv6 service.  This
   includes, but is not limited to, situations in which the mobile node
|  does not have any information when it boots up for the first time
   (out of the box), or does not retain any information during reboots.


(2)  missing line break

Near the end of Section 1.3, on page 5, there should be an additional
blank line above the term "Home Mobility Service Provider".


(3)  typo

On page 6, the last sub-bullet of the first bulleted list in Section 3
says:

      *  IPsec Security Association (SA) between MN and HA, Intenet Key
         Exchange Protocol (IKE) pre-shared secret between MN and HA

It should say:
                                                                v
|     *  IPsec Security Association (SA) between MN and HA, Internet Key
         Exchange Protocol (IKE) pre-shared secret between MN and HA


(4)  grammar (singluar/plural mismatch)

The first sentence of Section 5.1.3, on page 9, says:
                                                      vv
|  The home agent discovery protocol does not support an "opportunistic"
|  or local discovery mechanisms in an ASP's local access network.  [..]
                               ^
It either should say:

   The home agent discovery protocol does not support an "opportunistic"
|  or local discovery mechanism in an ASP's local access network.  [..]

or it should say:

|  The home agent discovery protocol does not support "opportunistic" or
   local discovery mechanisms in an ASP's local access network.  [..]

Please decide what was intended.


(5)  missing articles

The last paragraph of Section 5.3.1, on page 11, says:

   Bootstrapping does not explicitly try to solve this problem of home
   network renumbering when MN is in dormant mode.  If the MN can
   configure itself after it 'comes back on' by reinitiating the
   bootstrapping process, then network renumbering problem is fixed as a
   side effect.

It should better say:

   Bootstrapping does not explicitly try to solve this problem of home
|  network renumbering when the MN is in dormant mode.  If the MN can
   configure itself after it 'comes back on' by reinitiating the
|  bootstrapping process, then the network renumbering problem is fixed
   as a side effect.


(6)  missing article

The second paragraph of Section 7, on page 13, says:

   For each scenario, the underlying assumptions are described.  The
   basic assumption is that there is a trust relationship between mobile
   user and the MSA.  Typically, [...]

It should better say:

   For each scenario, the underlying assumptions are described.  The
|  basic assumption is that there is a trust relationship between the

(7)  missing article

The second paragraph of Section 7.2, on page 14, says:

   Figure 1 describes an AAA design example for integrated ASP scenario.

It should better say:

   Figure 1 describes an AAA design example for the integrated ASP
   scenario.


(8)  flawed artwork

Figure 2, on page 15,

  possible while still conforming to RFC formatting rules. ]



(9)  word omissions

Within the large first paragraph of Section 9.1, at the bottom of
page 17, there are two word omissions:

In the 2nd line of the paragraph, replace

	  ... between the home agent and mobile node
by:
          ... between the home agent and the mobile node

and in the 5th line from the bottom of the page, insert "be", changing

                                   [...].  The best way to minimize the
   probability of such a compromise is to have the cryptographic
   material only known or calculable by the two end nodes that share the
   SA -- in this case, the home agent and mobile node.  [...]

to:
                                   [...].  The best way to minimize the
   probability of such a compromise is to have the cryptographic
|  material only be known or calculable by the two end nodes that share
   the SA -- in this case, the home agent and mobile node.  [...]


(10)  strange accident with Ref. ??

In Section 12, near the bottom of page 20, a strange accident must
have hit the Ref. tagged [RFC3776] :
This indeed should be a citation of the Mobile IP related RFC 3776,
but it is a citiation of the unrelated RFC 3777 !!!
Thus,
replace this entry by the correct bibliographic entry for RFC 3776 !


Please comment.

Preferrably, to address these issues, you should prepare an
Author's Errata Note for RFC 4640, making freely use of the
material presented above, and submit it to the RFC Editor
for publication on the RFC Errata web pages.

Hello,
as an amendment to my earlier comments, I'd like to report another
issue with the recently published RFC 4641 (DNSSEC Op. Practices)
authored by you.


(5)  outdated Ref.

RFC 3757 has been formally obsoleted by (and incorporated into)
the new DNSSEC RFCs, RFC 4033..4035.
Therefore, RFC 3757 should not appear as a Normative Reference
in new RFCs any more.

Thus, the Normative Ref. [3] should have been omitted from
section 7.1, on page 27 of RFC 4641, and the two instances where
Ref. [3] is used in the text,
  - page  6, Section 3.1,   first paragraph,  and
  - page 24, Section 4.1.1, second paragraph
should have been changed to refer to [5], RFC 4034, instead.


Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
reading the recently published RFC 4619 (FR over MPLS)
edited by you, I found a couple of textual issues
I'd like to report.


(1)  typo (singular/plural mismatch)

The first paragraph of Section 1, on page 2, says:

     [..].  The main functions required to support frame relay PW by a
   Provider Edge (PE) include:

It should say:
                                                                 v
|    [..].  The main functions required to support frame relay PWs by a
   Provider Edge (PE) include:


(2)  improper wording (mismatch with what follows)

On page 3, the last paragraph above Figure 1 says:
                                                     v      vvv
   The following figure describes the reference models that are derived
   from [RFC3985] to support the frame relay PW emulated services.

It should say:

|  The following figure describes the reference model that is derived
   from [RFC3985] to support the frame relay PW emulated services.


(3)  typo (missing article)

Within Section 5, the 2nd list item on page 6 says:

   - Frame relay Local Management Interface (LMI) is terminated locally
     in the PE connected to the frame relay attachment circuit.

It should say:

|  - The Frame relay Local Management Interface (LMI) is terminated
     locally in the PE connected to the frame relay attachment circuit.


(4)  missing article

The last bullet within Section 7.2, near the top of page 8, says:

   - Payload

     The payload field corresponds to X.36/X.76 frame relay frame
     information field with the following components removed: bit/byte
     stuffing, frame relay header, and FCS.  [...]

It should say:

   - Payload

|    The payload field corresponds to an X.36/X.76 frame relay frame
     information field with the following components removed: bit/byte
     stuffing, frame relay header, and FCS.  [...]


(5)  typos/grammar

The last bulleted item in Section 7.6.2, on top of page 12, says:

                                        vvvvvv
|  - Otherwise, if the payload is longer, then the length specified in
|    the control word padding characters are removed according to the
     length field.
                     ^

It should say:
                                        v  v
|  - Otherwise, if the payload is longer than the length specified in
|    the control word, padding characters are removed according to the
     length field.
                     ^

(6)  typo

The second sentence in the first paragraph of Section 7.9, on page 12,

                                                           v
           [...].  If the PE detects a service-affecting condition for a
|  particular DLCI, as defined in [Q933] Q.933, Annex A.5, sited in IA
   FRF1.1, the PE MUST communicate to the remote PE the status of the PW
   that corresponds to the frame relay DLCI status.  [...]

should say:
                                                           v
           [...].  If the PE detects a service-affecting condition for a
|  particular DLCI, as defined in [Q933] Q.933, Annex A.5, cited in IA
   FRF1.1, the PE MUST communicate to the remote PE the status of the PW
   that corresponds to the frame relay DLCI status.  [...]


(7)  typo/grammar

The last sentence in the second paragraph of Section 7.9, on page 12,

   [...].  The IANA allocation registry of "Pseudowire Type" is defined
   in [RFC4446] along with initial allocated values.

should say:

|  [...].  The IANA allocation registry of "Pseudowire Types" is defined
|  in [RFC4446] along with initially allocated values.


Please comment.

Preferrably, to address these issues, you should prepare an
Author's Errata Note for RFC 4619, making freely use of the
material presented above, and submit it to the RFC Editor
for publication on the RFC Errata web pages.

Hello,
reading the recently published RFC 4606 (GMPLS for SONET/SDH)
authored by you, I found a couple of textual issues and flaws
I'd like to report.
Unfortunately, I never had found the time to comment on the
predecessor, RFC 3946, where some of these issues originate.


(1)  use of "N"

In Section 2.1 of RFC 4606, on page 6, the explanations for
the NCC field contain the Note:

   Note 2: When a transparent STS-N/STM-N signal is requested that is
   limited to a single contiguously concatenated STS-Nc_SPE/VC-4-Nc, the
   signal type must be STS-N/STM-N, RCC with flag 1, NCC set to 1.

Such text (and similar) contains an unfortunate mess-up of two
distinct uses of "N", with different range of admissible values
for STS-N and STM-N.
This becomes particularly confusing in phrases like
"a single contiguously concatenated STS-Nc_SPE/VC-4-Nc".
I strongly recommend to avoid this overloaded use of "N"
in a single context.
Using "M" for one of these two "N"s instead, i.e. talking
about "STS-M/STM-N", or talking about "STS-<3*N>/STM-N" or
even "STS-3N/STM-N", would remove the ambiguity and add to
the clarity of the text.


(2)  typo

In Section 3, at the bottom of page 11, the RFC says:

                     [...].  The standard definition for virtual
   concatenation allows each virtual concatenation components to travel
   over diverse paths.  [...]
                                                            ^
It should say:

                     [...].  The standard definition for virtual
|  concatenation allows each virtual concatenation component to travel
   over diverse paths.  [...]

or perhaps better:

                     [...].  The standard definition for virtual
|  concatenation allows the virtual concatenation components to travel
   over diverse paths.  [...]


(3)  continuation of (1)

Within section 3, the numbered rules on mid-page 13 would also
benefit from application of the arguments given in item (1) above:

   1.  S=1->N is the index of a particular STS-3/AUG-1 inside an
       STS-N/STM-N multiplex.  S is only significant for SONET STS-N
       (N>1) and SDH STM-N (N>0).  S must be 0 and ignored for STS-1 and
       STM-0.

should better be specified as:

   1.  S=1->N is the index of a particular STS-3/AUG-1 inside an
|      STS-3N/STM-N multiplex.
|      S is only significant for SONET STS-3N and SDH STM-N (N>0).
       S must be 0 and ignored for STS-1 and STM-0.

and

   2.  U=1->3 is the index of a particular STS-1_SPE/VC-3 within an
       STS-3/AUG-1.  U is only significant for SONET STS-N (N>1) and SDH
       STM-N (N>0).  U must be 0 and ignored for STS-1 and STM-0.

should better be specified as:

   2.  U=1->3 is the index of a particular STS-1_SPE/VC-3 within an
       STS-3/AUG-1.
|      U is only significant for SONET STS-3N and SDH STM-N (N>0).
       U must be 0 and ignored for STS-1 and STM-0.


(4)  inconsistency in examples

Still within Section 3, in the lower half of page 15,
under the headline:

   Examples of Labels

there are multiple occurrances of an index shift that makes the text
inconsistent with the tables on page 14 and the upper half of page 15.
E.g., "Kth-1" for "K>0" would result in "0th, 1st, 2nd" where the
appropriate table (at tho bottom of page 14) gives "1st, 2nd, 3rd" :

    K    SDH VC-4
   ---------------
    0    other
    1    1st TUG-3
    2    2nd TUG-3
    3    3rd TUG-3

Hence,
a)
                                                   vv
|  Example 2: the label for the VC-3 within the Kth-1 TUG-3 within
              the VC-4 in the Sth AUG-1 is: S>0, U=0, K>0, L=0, M=0.

should be corrected to say:

|  Example 2: the label for the VC-3 within the Kth TUG-3 within the
              VC-4 in the Sth AUG-1 is: S>0, U=0, K>0, L=0, M=0.

              Sth STS-3/AUG-1 is: S>0, U>0, K=0, L>0, M=8.


(5)  incomplete example

In Annex 1, at the bottom of page 21, the last list item says:

   10.  An STS-1-3v SPE signal is formed by the application of RCC with
        value 0, NVC with value 3 (virtual concatenation of 3
        components), MT with value 1, and T with value 0 to an STS-1 SPE
        Elementary Signal.

This text does not specify the significant NCC value.
It should say instead:

   10.  An STS-1-3v SPE signal is formed by the application of RCC with
|       value 0, NCC with value 0, NVC with value 3 (virtual
        concatenation of 3 components), MT with value 1, and T with
        value 0 to an STS-1 SPE Elementary Signal.


Please comment.

Preferrably, to address these issues, you should prepare an
Author's Errata Note for RFC 4606, making freely use of the
material presented above, and submit it to the RFC Editor
for publication on the RFC Errata web pages.

Hello,
reading the recently published RFC 4636 (MIP4 FA Error Extension)
authored by you, I found two issues I'd like to communicate to you.


(1)  missing meta-data

Section 4 of RFC 4636, on page 3, clearly states:

   This document updates the Mobile IP base specification [4] regarding
   the procedures followed by the foreign agent in the case that the
   home agent fails authentication.  [...]

... and [4] is RFC 3344.

Furthermore, RFC 4636 is on the Standards Track as well.
Therefore, I would have expected to find an

  Updates: 3344

line in the RFC heading, and appropriate links in the RFC index.

Has this been omitted by accident, or have there been strong
arguments to omit this significant link ?
In the former case, can that be corrected 'after the fact' ?


(2)  erratum ?

The first paragraph of Section 8, on page 4, says:

   The extension in this document improves the security features of
   Mobile IPv4 by allowing the mobile node to be assured of the
   authenticity of the information supplied within a Registration
|  Request.  [...]
   ^^^^^^^

>From the body of the RFC, I would have expected to find "Reply"
as the last word of that sentence -- cf. Section 1, 2nd sentence,
and Section 4, 1st sentence.
If that's true, it would perhaps be wise to post an RFC Errata Note
to the RFC-Ed's RFC Errata web pages addressing this issue.


Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
I have studied the recently published RFC 4631 (LMP MIB)
authored by you.

On February 24, I already had sent to you detailed comments
on numerous inconsistencies and textual issues I had found in
the predecessor of this RFC, RFC 4327.

I have never received any response on that message,
and I was not aware of the RFC revision in progress.
Unfortunately, I now find most of the issues mentioned
in February carried over to RFC 4631, and a few additional
issues newly introduced by this revised document.

For ease of reference, most of the text below has been copied
almost unchanged from this previous message -- including the
numbering of the items, only the RFC number and the details
of the page locations of the offending text have been adjusted;
new issues are tagged as such.

For clarity, I omit mail quoting tags, '> ', in the remainder
of this note.


(old #1)  [plaintext flaw]  -- resolved by RFC 4631


(new #1)  [spurious indentation] -- newly introduced

Within Section 7, on mid-page 8 the lines,

      In lmpDataLinkTable:
   {

should be:

|  In lmpDataLinkTable:
   {

[This flaw must have been introduced in the publication process
 of RFC 4631.]


(2)  [plaintext flaw]

In the second paragraph of Section 8, near the bottom of page 9,
RFC 4631 says:

                        [...].  The interrelation of entries in the
   ifTable is defined by Interfaces Stack Group defined in [RFC2863].

It should say:

                        [...].  The interrelation of entries in the
|  ifTable is defined by the Interfaces Stack Group defined in
   [RFC2863].
                        ^^^^^


(2') [punctuation] -- legacy, but not reported for RFC 4327

Conformant to the punctuation newly introduced in the REFERENCE
clauses, parts of the DESCRIPTION subclauses of the MODULE-IDENTITY
macro invocation should also be amended with a trailing full-stop:

On top of page 13, change:

        This revision published as RFC 4631"
   REVISION
       "200601110000Z"  -- 11 January 2006
   DESCRIPTION
       "Initial version published as RFC 4327"
   ::= { transmission 227 }

to say:

|       This revision published as RFC 4631."
   REVISION
       "200601110000Z"  -- 11 January 2006
   DESCRIPTION
|      "Initial version published as RFC 4327."
   ::= { transmission 227 }


(3)  LmpInterval TEXTUAL-CONVENTION  (page 13)

The clause,

   DESCRIPTION
       "The interval delay in milliseconds."

perhaps should better say:

   DESCRIPTION
|      "The delay interval in milliseconds."

or even:

   DESCRIPTION
|      "The interval period for a periodically performed LMP operation,
|       in milliseconds."

[Rationale: It's not the interval that's getting delayed ...]


(4)  LmpRetransmitInterval TEXTUAL-CONVENTION  (page 13)

The clause,

   DESCRIPTION
       "The retransmission interval delay in milliseconds."

perhaps should better say:

   DESCRIPTION
|      "The retransmission delay interval in milliseconds."

or even better:

   DESCRIPTION
|      "The (initial) retransmission interval in milliseconds."

[Rationale: It's not the interval that's getting delayed ...]


(old #5)  lmpNbrRetransmitInterval OBJECT-TYPE  (page 15)  -- resolved

(new #5)  lmpNbrRetransmitInterval OBJECT-TYPE  (page 15)
          -- legacy, but originally not reported

There's an extraneous blank line in the middle of the REFERENCE clause
that should be deleted (cf. lmpNbrRetryLimit OBJECT-TYPE, below).


(old #6)  lmpNbrRetryLimit OBJECT-TYPE  (page 15)  -- resolved

(new #6)  lmpCcUnderlyingIfIndex and lmpCcIsIf OBJECT-TYPEs  (page 20)
          -- newly introduced

The punctuation within the DESCRIPTION clauses for these objects
has been changed using one semicolon each.
IMHO, this is unfortunate because it might be misinterpreted as
excluding the subsequent half-sentences from the initial "If"
condition in these sentences that in fact are also preconditions
for the statements now after the semicolons.


(7)  lmpCcRemoteAddressType OBJECT-TYPE  (page 21)

   DESCRIPTION
       "This value represents the remote control channel IP address
        type.  In point-to-point configuration, this value can be set
        to unknown(0)."
   ::= { lmpControlChannelEntry 6 }

should better say:

   DESCRIPTION
       "This value represents the remote control channel IP address
|       type.  In point-to-point configurations, this value can be set
        to unknown(0)."
   ::= { lmpControlChannelEntry 6 }
                                              ^

[ The possible alternative, "In a point-to-point configuration, ..."
  is not proposed here, to maintain a style similar to the minimal
  change for the next object -- see (8) below.]


(8)  lmpCcRemoteIpAddr OBJECT-TYPE  (page 21) -- partially resolved

   DESCRIPTION
       "[...]
        The Control channel must be numbered on non-point-to-point
        configuration.  For point-to-point configuration, the
        remote control channel address can be of type unknown
        in which case this object must be a zero-length string.  The
        lmpCcRemoteId object then identifies the unnumbered
        address."
   ::= { lmpControlChannelEntry 7 }

should better say:

   DESCRIPTION
       "[...]
        The control channel must be numbered on non-point-to-point
|       configurations.  For point-to-point configurations, the
        remote control channel address can be of type unknown
        in which case this object must be a zero-length string.  The
        lmpCcRemoteId object then identifies the unnumbered
        address."
   ::= { lmpControlChannelEntry 7 }


(9)  lmpCcHelloInterval OBJECT-TYPE  (page 22)

An established 'default' specifies the value of a (newly created)
tabular object to be used when this object is not SET explicitely.
The default is never 'set', it is defined in the specification.
Hence,

   DESCRIPTION
       "This object specifies the value of the HelloInterval
        parameter.  The default value for this object should be
        set to lmpCcHelloIntervalDefault."
   ::= { lmpControlChannelEntry 10 }

should better say:

   DESCRIPTION
       "This object specifies the value of the HelloInterval
|       parameter.  The default value to be used for this object
|       is lmpCcHelloIntervalDefault."
   ::= { lmpControlChannelEntry 10 }


(9')   lmpCcHelloIntervalMin OBJECT-TYPE  (page 22) ,
(9'')  lmpCcHelloIntervalMax OBJECT-TYPE  (page 22) ,
(10)   lmpCcHelloDeadInterval OBJECT-TYPE  (page 23) ,
(10')  lmpCcHelloDeadIntervalMin OBJECT-TYPE  (page 23) , and
(10'') lmpCcHelloDeadIntervalMax OBJECT-TYPE  (page 23)

The change from item (9) above should be applied there similarly:

Replace the phrase,

           "[...].  The default value for this object should be
        set to lmp<*>Default."

by:

|          "[...].  The default value to be used for this object
|       is lmp<*>Default."

using, at all instances, the appropriate value for the placeholder <*>.


(11)  lmpControlChannelPerfEntry OBJECT-TYPE  (page 25)

   DESCRIPTION
       "An entry in this table is created by a LMP-enabled device for
        every control channel.  lmpCcCounterDiscontinuityTime is used
        to indicate potential discontinuity for all counter objects
        in this table."

The latter is not true.
In this MIB module, the discontinuity is monitored per table *entry*
(conceptual row), not for the table as a whole -- see the DESCRIPTIONs
for lmp<*>DiscontinuityTime later in the RFC.

Therefore, the above clause should say:

   DESCRIPTION
       "An entry in this table is created by a LMP-enabled device for
        every control channel.  lmpCcCounterDiscontinuityTime is used
        to indicate potential discontinuity for all counter objects
|       in this entry (conceptual row)."


(12)  lmpCcChannelStatusAckSent OBJECT-TYPE  (page 35)

The clause,

   DESCRIPTION
       "This object counts the number of ChannelStatus messages
        that have been sent on this control channel."
   ::= { lmpControlChannelPerfEntry 47 }

refers to the wrong message type; it should say:

   DESCRIPTION
|      "This object counts the number of ChannelStatusAck messages
        that have been sent on this control channel."
   ::= { lmpControlChannelPerfEntry 47 }


(13)  lmpTeLinkEntry OBJECT-TYPE  (page 37)

The DESCRIPTION clause contains the sentence:

                                                      [...].  The
        administrative status value is controlled from the ifEntry.
        [...]

This sentence should say:

                                                      [...].  The
|       administrative status is controlled from the ifEntry.
        [...]


(13') lmpLinkVerifyTransportMechanism OBJECT-TYPE  (page 41)  -- new

Missing punctution between the two parts of the REFERENCE clause:

   REFERENCE
       "Link Management Protocol, RFC 4204
        Synchronous Optical Network (SONET)/Synchronous Digital
        Hierarchy (SDH) Encoding for Link Management Protocol (LMP)
        Test Messages, RFC 4207."

should say:

   REFERENCE
       "Link Management Protocol, RFC 4204.
        Synchronous Optical Network (SONET)/Synchronous Digital
        Hierarchy (SDH) Encoding for Link Management Protocol (LMP)
        Test Messages, RFC 4207."

[... or use a semicolon after "RFC 4204".]
[Note: This item not reported for RFC 4327 -- there was a page
 break effectively hiding the issue.]


(14)  lmpTeLinkPerfEntry OBJECT-TYPE  (page 43)

The correction from item (11) above is to be applied here as well:

Replace:

   DESCRIPTION
       "An entry in this table is created by an LMP-enabled device for
        every TE link.  lmpTeCounterDiscontinuityTime is used
        to indicate potential discontinuity for all counter objects
        in this table."

by:

   DESCRIPTION
       "An entry in this table is created by an LMP-enabled device for
        every TE link.  lmpTeCounterDiscontinuityTime is used
        to indicate potential discontinuity for all counter objects
|       in this entry (conceptual row)."


(15)  lmpTeEndVerifyRetransmit OBJECT-TYPE  (page 46)
      -- rationale given now extended

   DESCRIPTION
       "This object counts the number of EndVerify messages that
        have been retransmitted over this control channel."
   ::= { lmpTeLinkPerfEntry 12 }

is inappropriate -- it does not match the indexing structure of the
LMP TE Link Performance Table.  In accordance with the text supplied
for the other objects in this Table, it should say:

   DESCRIPTION
       "This object counts the number of EndVerify messages that
|       have been retransmitted for this TE link."
   ::= { lmpTeLinkPerfEntry 12 }


(16)  lmpTeTestStatusFailureRetransmit OBJECT-TYPE  (page 48)

   DESCRIPTION
       "This object counts the number of TestStatusFailure messages
        that have been retransmitted on this TE link."
   ::= { lmpTeLinkPerfEntry 20 }

should say:

   DESCRIPTION
       "This object counts the number of TestStatusFailure messages
        that have been retransmitted for this TE link."
   ::= { lmpTeLinkPerfEntry 20 }

[ According to Section 12.5.8. of the LMP specification [RFC 4204],
  LMP TestStatusFailure messages are transmitted over the control
  channel; hence, "retransmitted *on* this TE Link" is wrong! ]


(17)  lmpTeLinkSummaryRetransmit OBJECT-TYPE  (page 49)

The correction from item (15) above is to be applied here as well:

Replace:

The correction from item (13) above is to be applied here as well:

The sentence in the DESCRIPTION clause,

The correction from item (11) above is to be applied here as well:

Replace:

       "An entry in this table contains information about
        the LMP performance counters for the data-bearing links.

(21a) lmpNotificationMaxRate OBJECT-TYPE  (page 58)
      -- item was numbered (21) previously; recent punctuation
         updates now incorporated in text below

The DESCRIPTION text (near the end of its 2nd paragraph, ff.) says:

                        [...].  For instance, a network of 100 nodes
        with 5 links of 128 wavelengths each and a link verification
        of 1 minute, with no more than 10% of the links failed at any
        given time, would have 1 notification per second sent from
        each node, or 100 notifications per second for the whole
        network.  The rest of the notifications are negligible
        compared to this number.

        To alleviate the congestion problem, the
        lmpNotificationMaxRate object can be used to implement a
        throttling mechanism.  It is also possible to enable/disable
        certain type of notifications.

It should say, correcting two flaws (line breaks adjusted):

                        [...].  For instance, a network of 100 nodes
        with 5 links of 128 wavelengths each and a link verification
|       interval of 1 minute, with no more than 10% of the links failed
        at any given time, would have 1 notification per second sent
        from each node, or 100 notifications per second for the whole
        network.  The rest of the notifications are negligible
        compared to this number.

        To alleviate the congestion problem, the
        lmpNotificationMaxRate object can be used to implement a
        throttling mechanism.  It is also possible to enable/disable
|       certain types of notifications.


(21b) lmpUnprotected NOTIFICATION-TYPE  (page 61)  -- newly introduced

In the DESCRIPTION clause,

                             [...].  If the remaining operational
        control channel fails, then there will be no more control
        channels between the pair of nodes and all the TE links
|       between the pair of nodes, will go to degraded state.  [...]
                                 ^

the newly added comma makes no sense, it separates the noun from the
verb after 'and'; this sentence should say:

                             [...].  If the remaining operational
        control channel fails, then there will be no more control
        channels between the pair of nodes and all the TE links
|       between the pair of nodes will go to degraded state.  [...]

Perhaps, a comma migth instead be inserted before the 'and':

                             [...].  If the remaining operational
        control channel fails, then there will be no more control
|       channels between the pair of nodes, and all the TE links
|       between the pair of nodes will go to degraded state.  [...]


(21c) lmpModuleReadOnlyCompliance MODULE-COMPLIANCE, restriction
      clause for (lmpDataLinkTable) OBJECT lmpDataLinkIPAddr  (page 71)

      DESCRIPTION
          "The size of the data-bearing link IP address depends on
           the type of data-bearing link.  Data-bearing link IP
           address size is zero if the link is unnumbered, four if
           the link IP address is IPv4, and sixteen if the link IP
           address is IPv6."

should better say:

      DESCRIPTION
          "The size of the data-bearing link IP address depends on
|          the type of data-bearing link.  The data-bearing link IP
           address size is zero if the link is unnumbered, four if
           the link IP address is IPv4, and sixteen if the link IP
           address is IPv6."


(22)  lmpNodeGroup OBJECT-GROUP  (page 72)

The RFC says:

   DESCRIPTION
          "Collection of objects that represent LMP node
           configuration."
   ::= { lmpGroups 1 }

It should say:

   DESCRIPTION
|         "Collection of objects that represents the LMP node
           configuration."
   ::= { lmpGroups 1 }

[ In fact, it is *the collection* (singular) that represents
  the node configuration! ]


(23)  lmpControlChannelGroup OBJECT-GROUP  (page 72/73)

On mid-pge 73, the RFC says:

   DESCRIPTION
          "Objects that can be used to configure LMP interface."

It should say:

   DESCRIPTION
|         "Objects that can be used to configure LMP interfaces."


(24)  lmpDataLinkGroup OBJECT-GROUP  (page 77)

Similar to item (22) above, the clause,

   DESCRIPTION
          "Collection of objects that represent data-bearing link
           configuration."
   ::= { lmpGroups 9 }

should better say:

   DESCRIPTION
          "Collection of objects that represents data-bearing link
           configurations."
   ::= { lmpGroups 9 }


Please comment.

Hello,
after studying the recently published RFCs on RADIUS related
MIB modules, I would like to send to you, the author, a few
additional comments on RFC 4668..4671.

Because of the more general nature of the issue raised in the second
half of item (1) below, I have copied this note to the MIB doctor
Bert Wijnen.


(0)

Another, general issue has been dealt with in another message
already sent to you, the authors of RFC 4672/73, and Bert Wijnen.
For completeness, I repeat the list of related objects within
your RFCs:

- radiusAuthClientIdentifier
    in the RADIUS-AUTH-CLIENT-MIB, RFC 4668, page 6/7

- radiusAuthClientID          (deprecated object)
    in the RADIUS-AUTH-SERVER-MIB, RFC 4669, page 11
- radiusAuthClientExtID       (replacement / new object)
    in the RADIUS-AUTH-SERVER-MIB, RFC 4669, page 15

- radiusAccClientIdentifier
    in the RADIUS-ACC-CLIENT-MIB, RFC 4670, page 7

- radiusAccClientID           (deprecated object)
    in the RADIUS-ACC-SERVER-MIB, RFC 4671, page 11
- radiusAccClientExtID        (replacement / new object)
    in the RADIUS-ACC-SERVER-MIB, RFC 4671, page 14
)


(1)  misleading RFC titles, including abuse of defined terms

IMHO, the RFC titles, "RADIUS ... MIB for IPv6" are misleading.
In fact, the new RFCs extend the RADIUS MIB modules to cover
IPv6, but they are not IPv6 specific!
Perhaps, better wording would have been "... for IPv4 and IPv6".

Furthermore, a very 'popular' clash of terms shines up here.
As specified in RFC 3410 and Part 1 of STD 62, RFC 3411, and
re-stated in the boilerplate Section 3, "The Internet-Standard
Management Framework", of all four RFCs, there's just one single
Management Information Base (MIB) comprised of various "MIB modules".
Thus, throughout the titles and the text bodies of the RFCs, the
proper term, "RADIUS ... MIB module" should be used instead of the
rather sluggish "RADIUS ... MIB".


(2)  wrong formula in ASN.1 comments ??
     (RFC 4668 -- legacy from RFC 2618)

Around the page break from page 8 to page 9, and once more,
near the top of page 14, RFC 4668 states the formula:

   --
   -- AccessRequests + PendingRequests + ClientTimeouts =
   -- Successfully received
   --

I strongly suspect that this is wrong (-- and it does not either
match the presentation style of the formulae above in the text).
Conceptually, it makes no sense to count 'PendingRequests' and
'ClientTimeouts' as 'Successfully received', and the subsequent
DESCRIPTION clauses strongly support my suspicion that both
instances of this formula in fact should say:

                    vvv               vvv
   --
|  -- AccessRequests - PendingRequests - ClientTimeouts =
   -- Successfully received
   --


(3)  punctuation (traditional vs. rational quoting)
     (RFC 4669 and RFC 4671 -- legacy)

The DESCRIPTION clause of the radiusAuthServResetTime OBJECT-TYPE
declaration, on page 7 od RFC 4669, says:

                "If the server has a persistent state (e.g., a process)
                 and supports a 'reset' operation (e.g., can be told to
                 re-read configuration files), this value will be the
                 time elapsed (in hundredths of a second) since the
|                server was 'reset.'  [...]
                                  ^^
This does not conform to the 'rational qouting' style required
by the RFC authoring guidelines.  The RFC should say instead:

                "If the server has a persistent state (e.g., a process)
                 and supports a 'reset' operation (e.g., can be told to
                 re-read configuration files), this value will be the
                 time elapsed (in hundredths of a second) since the
|                server was 'reset'.  [...]
                                  ^^

This issues also applies to the DESCRIPTION clauses of
radiusAccServResetTime  (RFC 4671, page 7).

(3')  Note:

Why not using, in the text above, the common ISO-standard
unit-multiple name, "centiseconds" (abbreviation: "cs"),
instead of the long-winded "hundredths of a second" ?

This also applies to the DESCRIPTION clauses of
  - radiusAuthClientRoundTripTime  (RFC 4668, page 8),
  - radiusAuthClientExtRoundTripTime  (RFC 4668, page 13),
  - radiusAuthServUpTime  (RFC 4669, top of page 7),
  - radiusAccServUpTime  (RFC 4671, page 7),
  - radiusAccServResetTime  (RFC 4671, page 7),
  and three objects in RFC 4672/4673


(4)  typo in RFC 4670

The DESCRIPTION clause of the radiusAccClientRetransmissions
OBJECT-TYPE declaration, on mid-page 9 of RFC 4670 says:

         DESCRIPTION
               "The number of RADIUS Accounting-Request packets
                retransmitted to this RADIUS accounting server.
                Retransmissions include retries where the
                Identifier and Acct-Delay have been updated, as
                well as those in which they remain the same."

it should say, for temproal consistency:

         DESCRIPTION
               "The number of RADIUS Accounting-Request packets
                retransmitted to this RADIUS accounting server.
                Retransmissions include retries where the
                Identifier and Acct-Delay have been updated, as
|               well as those in which they remained the same."
                                                  ^^


I leave it to your decision as to which of the items listed above
should be addressed by an RFC Errata Note submitted to the
RFC-Editor's RFC Errata web page (please make freely use of the
material presented above), or otherwise filed for consideration
in any future update to these RFCs.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
after studying the recently published RFCs on RADIUS related
MIB modules, I would like to send to you, the authors of
RFC 4672 and RFC 4673, a few additional comments on these RFCs.

As there are some general/important issues raised in this message
(see items (1)..(3) below), I have copied it to Bert Wijnen for
the MIB doctors.

Item (3) details an apparently severe structural inconsistency
in both specifications.


(0)

Another, general issue has been dealt with in another message
already sent to you, the authors of RFC 4668..4671, and Bert Wijnen.
For completeness, I repeat the list of related objects within
your RFCs:

- radiusDynAuthServerID
    in the RADIUS-DYNAUTH-CLIENT-MIB, RFC 4672, page 7

- radiusDynAuthServerIdentifier
    in the RADIUS-DYNAUTH-SERVER-MIB, RFC 4673, page 6


(1)  abuse of defined terms

In the titles and the text body of both RFCs, a very 'popular'
clash of terms shines up.

As specified in RFC 3410 and Part 1 of STD 62, RFC 3411, and
re-stated in the boilerplate Section 3, "The Internet-Standard
Management Framework", of both RFCs, there's just one single
Management Information Base (MIB) comprised of various "MIB modules".
Thus, throughout the titles and the text bodies of the RFCs, the
proper term, "RADIUS ... MIB module" should be used consistently,
instead of the rather sluggish "RADIUS ... MIB".


(2)  OID hierarchy

I am surprised that the 'OID anchor' of the RADIUS-DYNAUTH-xxx-MIB
modules does not match the OID hierarchy used in the other RADIUS
MIB modules published/updated concurrently.
I would have expected the new RADIUS MIB modules to be assigned OIDs
in the following, hierarchical way (using abbreviated notation):

  radiusMIB                  { mib-2 67 }  -- legacy, assigned by IANA
  radiusDynAuth              { radiusMIB 3 }       -- new
  RADIUS-DYNAUTH-CLIENT-MIB  { radiusDynAuth 1 }   -- new
  RADIUS-DYNAUTH-SERVER-MIB  { radiusDynAuth 2 }   -- new

instead of obtaining separate IANA assignments for the MIB module
OIDs, directly under mib-2.

Has there been a strong reason for this deviation from the established
pattern?


(3)  severe MIB module structural problem
     -- issue instantiated similarly in both RFCs

Let's start with RFC 4672 and the RADIUS-DYNAUTH-CLIENT-MIB module.

On page 5 of RFC 4672, two module-global scalar objects are specified;
the DESCRIPTION clause of the
radiusDynAuthClientDisconInvalidServerAddresses OBJECT-TYPE says:

                                           [...].  This counter may
                 experience a discontinuity when the DAC module
                 (re)starts, as indicated by the value of
                 radiusDynAuthClientCounterDiscontinuity."

and the literally same sentence appears again in the DESCRIPTION
clause of the radiusDynAuthClientCoAInvalidServerAddresses OBJECT-TYPE.

This would make sense iff radiusDynAuthClientCounterDiscontinuity
would have been defined as another module-global scalar MIB object.
But unfortunately, radiusDynAuthClientCounterDiscontinuity is a
tabular row object in the radiusDynAuthServerTable, with separate
instances for every radiusDynAuthServerIndex instantiated there.
So, which object instance should be taken for reference ???
Moreover, should ever the radiusDynAuthServerTable be empty,
no such CounterDiscontinuity objects would be instantiated,
invalidating the semantical integrity of the MIB module.

Thus, let's take a closer look at the DESCRIPTION clause of the
radiusDynAuthClientCounterDiscontinuity OBJECT-TYPE, on page 17
of the RFC:

          DESCRIPTION
                "The time (in hundredths of a second) since the
                 last counter discontinuity.  A discontinuity may
                 be the result of a reinitialization of the DAC
                 module within the managed entity."

It remains unclear which scope was intended, i.e. whether "the last
counter discontinuity" was meant to just cover the counters within
the same conceptual row of the table, of it was meant to cover all
the counter objects in the MIB module.
If the former interpretation is to be accepted, the references
to this object from the scalar objects' DESCRIPTIONS quoted above
would be severely ambiguous.
In case of the latter interpretation, the semantics of this object
indeed do not depend in any way on the conceptual row, i.e. the
related radiusDynAuthServerIndex instance; but if an object of
the same semantics appears in every table row instantiated, all
of its instances must have the same value at any point in time.
Hence, the object with that semantics should have been modeled
as a module-global scalar object, and not as a tabular object !!!

IMHO, such a single, module-global scalar object would perhaps be
sufficient for the desired purpose.

In a similar way, the module-global scalar counters in the
RADIUS-DYNAUTH-SERVER-MIB module,
radiusDynAuthServerDisconInvalidClientAddresses and
adiusDynAuthServerCoAInvalidClientAddresses,
as specified on page 6 of RFC 4673, refer to the object,
radiusDynAuthServerCounterDiscontinuity,
which turns out to be a tabular row object in the
radiusDynAuthClientTable, not another scalar object,
thus leading to the same kind of ambiguity.

Taken altogether, the specifications are ambigous and will certainly
lead to interoperability problems.

I strongly propose to revise these MIB module specifications as
soon as possible.


(3')  Note:

Why not using, in the text above, the common ISO-standard
unit-multiple name, "centiseconds" (abbreviation: "cs"),
instead of the long-winded "hundredths of a second" ?

This applies to the UNITS and the DESCRIPTION clauses of
  - radiusDynAuthClientRoundTripTime         (RFC 4672, page 7),
  - radiusDynAuthClientCounterDiscontinuity  (RFC 4672, page 17),
  - radiusDynAuthServerCounterDiscontinuity  (RFC 4673, page 17),
  and (for information only:)
  several objects in RFC 4668..4671 as well.


(4)  erratum: repeatedly occurring spurious text in RFC 4672

The DESCRIPTION clauses of several OBJECT-TYPE invocations in RFC 4672
contain the same spurious fragment of a sentence:

   [...].  Disconnect-NAK packets received from unknown addresses.

This fragment apparently has been copied inadvertently from the
DESCRIPTION clause for radiusDynAuthClientDisconInvalidServerAddress,
and it should be deleted afterwards, in all instances:

  - radiusDynAuthClientCoAInvalidServerAddresses  (page 5),
  - radiusDynAuthClientDisconRequests  (page 8),
  - radiusDynAuthClientDisconAuthOnlyRequests  (page 8), and
  - radiusDynAuthClientDisconRetransmissions  (page 8).


(5)  erratum: word omission in RFC 4673

The DESCRIPTION clause of the radiusDynAuthServCoAUserSessChanged
OBJECT-TYPE, on page 15 of RFC 4673, says:

       DESCRIPTION
             "The number of user sessions authorization
              changed for the CoA-Requests received from this
              Dynamic Authorization Client.  [...]

For clarity, it should perhaps better say:

                                         vvvvvv
       DESCRIPTION
|            "The number of user sessions with authorization
              changed for the CoA-Requests received from this
              Dynamic Authorization Client.  [...]

[or use similar wording].


I leave it to your decision as to which of the items listed above
should be addressed by an RFC Errata Note submitted to the
RFC-Editor's RFC Errata web page (please make freely use of the
material presented above), or otherwise filed for consideration
in any future update to these RFCs.
But, as stated above with item (3), perhaps an immediate revision
of the MIB modules should be considered seriously.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hi this is the same person who sent an e-mail about typographical errors on
"RFC 2616, 4.4, Message Length."

As I read through, I've found 2 more errors on "RFC 2616 14.3Accept-Encoding."

Here's the paragrah.

14.3 Accept-Encoding

The Accept-Encoding request-header field is similar to Accept, but restricts
the content-codings (section 3.5) that are acceptable in the response.

       Accept-Encoding  = "Accept-Encoding" ":"

                          1#( codings [ ";" "q" "=" qvalue ] )
       codings          = ( content-coding | "*" )

 Examples of its use are:

       Accept-Encoding: compress, gzip
       Accept-Encoding:
       Accept-Encoding: *
       Accept-Encoding: compress;q=0.5, gzip;q=1.0
       Accept-Encoding: gzip;q=1.0, identity; q=0.5, *;q=0


As you can see, Accept-Encoding has to consist of 1 or more ( codings [ ";"
"q" "=" qvalue ] ).
And if you see the definition of '#', you can find out that null element
can't be counted, and this means you can't just leave a blank after
Accept-Encoding: .
But in the given example, there exists a blank space and this is considered
as a correct one.

The second error is at the last line. Right after the semi-colon, there
can't be a space(SP) by definition, but there actually is in the example.

I don't know whether you'll see this or not since there's no way to check,
but I hope the errors get fixed.

Hello,
reading the recently published RFC 4698 (IRIS Addr Registry Type)
authored by you, I found a few textual flaws.


(1)  multiple typos

Within Section 4, the last two bullets on page 14 of RFC 4698,

   o  Most specific: Given a set of networks, the network or networks
|     that are more specific than zero or more specific of the other
|     networks in the set, and that are not less specific of any of the
      networks in the set.

   o  Least specific: Given a set of networks, the network or networks
|     that are not more specific to any of the other networks in the
      set.

should perhaps better say:

   o  Most specific: Given a set of networks, the network or networks
|     that are more specific than zero or more of the other networks in
|     the set, and that are not less specific than any of the networks
      in the set.

   o  Least specific: Given a set of networks, the network or networks
|     that are not more specific than any of the other networks in the
      set.


(2)  distorting typo

On page 16, the text for example (2) in Section 4 says:

   (2) one-level less specifics search: Given a range, find only the
       most specific network that contains that range (could be multiple
       networks, but usually single).  This is the set of networks from
       (1), with the provision that no network in the return set is
       contained by any other network in the set.  If there are exact
|      match networks in the set from (1), they both must appear in the
       result set.  The result set may contain a network that is exact
       match to the query range, if the search allows exact matches.

It should say:

   (2) one-level less specifics search: Given a range, find only the
       most specific network that contains that range (could be multiple
       networks, but usually single).  This is the set of networks from
       (1), with the provision that no network in the return set is
       contained by any other network in the set.  If there are exact
|      match networks in the set from (1), they all must appear in the
       result set.  The result set may contain a network that is exact
       match to the query range, if the search allows exact matches.


(3)  typo (missing article)

On page 31 of RFC 4698, Section 7.2 says:

   Address registries do not have natural links to DNS.  Using reverse
   DNS tree presents problems for IP address delegation (for example,
   delegations do not fall into byte boundaries, unlike reverse DNS),
   and DNS does not currently contain any information regarding
   autonomous system delegation.

It should better say:
                                                              vvvv
|  Address registries do not have natural links to DNS.  Using the
   reverse DNS tree presents problems for IP address delegation (for
   example, delegations do not fall into byte boundaries, unlike
   reverse DNS), and DNS does not currently contain any information
   regarding autonomous system delegation.


I leave it to your decision which of the items above should be
addressed by an RFC Errata Note.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
reading the recently published RFC 4664 (L2VPN Framework)
edited by you, I found a couple of textual flaws I'd like
to report.


(1)  ASCII artwork hazard

Section 2.1, on page 5 of RFC 4664, presents Figure 1 as:

                  Attachment        PSN           Attachment
                   Circuits        tunnel          Circuits

           +-----+                 pseudo                    +-----+
           |     |                  wire                     |     |

           +-----+  +----|---- |   |  P  |     | ----+----+  +-----+
                         |VPWS\---|-----|-----|/VPWS|
                         | PE1 |===|=====|=====| PE2 |
                         |    /|---|-----|-----|\\    |
           +-----+  +----|---- |   |     |     | ----|----+  +-----+
           |     |  |    +-----+   +-----+     +-----+    |  |     |
           | CE3 |--+                                     +--| CE4 |
           |     |                                           |     |
           +-----+                                           +-----+


Apparently, there must have been some hazard against this artwork.
I suspect that in fact it should be:

                  Attachment        PSN           Attachment
                   Circuits        tunnel          Circuits

           +-----+                 pseudo                    +-----+
           |     |                  wire                     |     |
           | CE1 |--+                                     +--| CE2 |

(2)  improper indentation

The final paragraphs of Section 2.2, on page 8,

        There may be other models as well, some of which are
        combinations of the 3 models above.  Different models may have
        different characteristics, and different scopes of
        applicability.

        Each VPLS solution should specify the model or models that it is
        supporting.  Each solution should also specify the necessary
        bridge functionality that its bridge modules must support.

        This framework does not specify the way in which bridge control
        protocols are used on the Emulated LANs.

apparently should not be (visually) part of the "Model 3" explanation.
Therefore, the same indentation level should be used as before for
the body of the section, above the model enumeration:

   There may be other models as well, some of which are combinations of
   the 3 models above.  Different models may have different
   characteristics, and different scopes of applicability.

   Each VPLS solution should specify the model or models that it is
   supporting.  Each solution should also specify the necessary bridge
   functionality that its bridge modules must support.

   This framework does not specify the way in which bridge control
   protocols are used on the Emulated LANs.


(3)  missing word

On page 20, in the first list item of Section 3.2.7.1, the text,

      - Customer Traffic Prioritization: L2VPN services could be best
        effort or QoS guaranteed.  Traffic from one customer might need
        to be prioritized over others when sharing same network
        resources.  [...]

should say:

      - Customer Traffic Prioritization: L2VPN services could be best
        effort or QoS guaranteed.  Traffic from one customer might need
|       to be prioritized over others when sharing the same network
        resources.  [...]
                                                  ^^^^^

(4)  extraneous word

In section 3.4, the 2nd-to-last paragraph on page 30 says:

   A further issue arises if the PE bridges run bridge control protocols
   with each other over the Emulated LAN.  Bridge control protocols are
|  generally designed to run in over a real LAN and may presume, for
   their proper functioning, certain characteristics of the LAN, such as
   low latency and sequential delivery.  [...]

It should better say:

   A further issue arises if the PE bridges run bridge control protocols
   with each other over the Emulated LAN.  Bridge control protocols are
|  generally designed to run over a real LAN and may presume, for
   their proper functioning, certain characteristics of the LAN, such as
   low latency and sequential delivery.  [...]


(5)  typo

In section 3.4.3, the 2nd paragrph on page 34 says:

   Relative to the VPLS there are three different possibilities for
   allocate functions to a device in such a position in the provider
   network:

It should better say:

   Relative to the VPLS there are three different possibilities for
|  allocating functions to a device in such a position in the provider
   network:


(6)  typo

In Section 4, the 5th paragraph on page 38 says:

   Thus, for inter-SP control connections, it is advisable to use some
   sort of cryptographic authentication procedure.  Control protocols
|  which used TCP may use the TCP MD5 option to provide a measure of
   PE-PE authentication; this requires at least one shared secret
   between SPs.  [...]

It should better say:

   sort of cryptographic authentication procedure.  Control protocols
|  which use TCP may use the TCP MD5 option to provide a measure of
   PE-PE authentication; this requires at least one shared secret
   between SPs.  [...]


(7)  outdated References

Section 7, on page 41, contains two outdated Informative References:

RFC 1771 has been obsoleted by RFC 4271, and RFC 2796 has been
obsoleted by RFC 4456, where both new RFCs have been published
far ahead of RFC 4664.

Therefore,
-  the tag "[RFC1771]" should have been replaced by "[RFC4271]", and
-  the tag "[RFC2796]" should have been replaced by "[RFC4456]"
(throughout the body of RFC 4664), and the related entries
in Section 7 updated accordingly.


I leave it to your decision as to which of the items above
should be addressed by an RFC Errata Note.  Preferrably, you
might submit an Authors' Errata Note, making freely use of the
material presented above.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
after studying the recently published RFC 4607 (SSM for IP)
authored by you, I would like to submit a few comments,
pointing out a few issues I found with the RFC text -- the
second of which is considered serious.


(1)  erratum: outdated Reference

Unfortunately, Section 1 (first paragraph) and Section 11
of RFC 4607 refer to the previous IPv6 Address Architecture
document, RFC 3513, that has been superseded by RFC 4291,
published in February.
This is done using the Ref. tag, '[RFC3513]'.
It would have been much better if this would have been
updated to [RFC4291], and the appropriate rfc-ref entry
used in Section 16, near the bottom of page 16.


(2)  problems with IPv6 SSM address range, and with related text

The 4th paragraph of Section 1, on page 3, RFC 4607 says:

   Addresses in the range FF3x::4000:0001 through FF3x::7FFF:FFFF are
   reserved in [IPv6-MALLOC] for allocation by IANA.  Addresses in the
   range FF3x::8000:0000 through FF3x::FFFF:FFFF are allowed for dynamic
   allocation by a host, as described in [IPv6-MALLOC].  Addresses in
   the range FF3x::0000:0000 through FF3x::3FFF:FFFF are invalid IPv6
   SSM addresses.  ([IPv6-MALLOC] indicates that FF3x::0000:0001 to
   FF3x::3FFF:FFFF must set P=0 and T=0, but for SSM, [IPv6-UBM]
   mandates that  P=1 and T=1, hence their designation as invalid.)  ...

I see a lot of problems in that reasoning.

a) The most obvious issue first:
As far as I can see, RFC 3307 [IPv6-MALLOC] only requires for
"Permanent IPv6 Multicast Addresses":

   Multicast addresses assigned by IANA MUST have the T bit set to 0 and
   the P bit set to 0.

(RFC 3307, Section 4, top of page 4)

This restriction is not mentioned for other cases.

Since the '3' nibbles in "FF3x::0000:0000 through FF3x::3FFF:FFFF"
just mean P=1 and T=1 (cf. RFC 3306 [IPv6-UBM], Section 4, pp. 2/3),
IMHO the phrase from the above quotation,
                  [IPv6-MALLOC] indicates that FF3x::0000:0001 to
   FF3x::3FFF:FFFF must set P=0 and T=0,
is neither logical nor conclusive.  Hence the final conclusion,
                   "hence their designation as invalid."
does not hold.

Perhaps it would have been much more simple and clear to just
declare the range FF3x::0000:0000 through FF3x::3FFF:FFFF as
reserved or invalid -- without giving any reason.

b) Delving into further details of RFC 3307, one can find that
Section 4.2 reserves the range 0x40000000 to 0x7FFFFFFF for
"Permanent IPv6 Multicast Group Identifiers" with the intent that
assignments in that range hold
   "regardless of the upper 96 bits of the multicast address".

On the other hand, the current IPv6 Addressing Architecture document
clearly states that
   T=0 means  "well known" / "permanently-assiged" / IANA allocated,
while
   T=1 means  "transient" / "dynamically allocated".
Under this rule, the above "regardless" in RFC 3307 is partially
invalid, because upper 96 bits containing T=1 are not allowed for
IANA allocated MC addresses.

[Note: Perhaps, this statement is also inappropriate, because
 RFC 3307 initially states (in Section 4, at the bottom of page 3):
   ....  The following guidelines assume that the prefix of the
   multicast address has been initialized according to [ADDRARCH] or
   [UNIMCAST].
 and both specifications quoted restrict or fix the values of some
 of these upper 96 bits ...]

Hence, there is a subtle conflict between RFC 3307 and RFC 4291 !

c) Taking the ADDRARCH and RFC 3307 rules together, it is clear
that the first sentence of the RFC 4607 quotation above,
   Addresses in the range FF3x::4000:0001 through FF3x::7FFF:FFFF are
   reserved in [IPv6-MALLOC] for allocation by IANA.
does not hold, as T=1 in these addresses !

Later on, in Section 9 (IANA Cosiderations, page 15), RFC 4607 says:

   IANA allocates IPv4 addresses in the range 232.0.0.1 through
   232.0.0.255 and IPv6 addresses in the range FF3x:4000:0001 to
   FF3x::7FFF:FFFF.  [...]

The latter clearly contradicts RFC 4291 for this reason (T=1).

Therefore, this range might better have been reserved/forbidden,
or excluded from the IPv6 SSM address range.


Taking all together:
There are serious conflicts between RFC 4291, RFC 3307, and RFC 4607.

Sadly enough, it seems that it was not a good idea to assign
FF3x::/32 for IPv6 SSM.

I'm sure that RFC 4291 should NOT be called in question.

Perhaps, it would have been better to restrict the IPv6 SSM range to
FF3x::8000:0000/31, and *not* provide for any subrange available
for specific IANA assignments.
Then, should there really arise the serious need for IANA allocated,
specific IPv6 SSM addresses, another (small) range (with T=0 and P=0)
could be assigned additionally for this purpose.

[Note 1: Thus, this address range would indeed fall under the regime
 of Section 4.1 of RFC 3307, "Permanent IPv6 Multicast Addresses".
 Note 2: T=0 + P=1 would necessitate a formal update to RFC 3306 that
 does not allow this combination, and maybe to RFC 3956 as well.]

If I have not misunderstood something, or overlooked something
important, there really is a serious problem.
Please comment.


(3)  erratum: typo

Finally, there's a small typo in Section 7.5 of RFC 4607, on page 14.
In the second paragraph of the section,

                    ... applied to all source address ...
should say:
                    ... applied to all source addresses ...


Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
after studying the recently published RFC 4541 (IGMP & MLD Snooping)
authored by you, I would like to submit a few comments, pointing
out some issues I found with the RFC text, and supplying material
for an appropriate RFC Errata Note.


(1)  improper IPv6 term used

Within Section 3 of RFC 4541, the 5th paragraph (spanning the page
break from page 8 to page 9) says:

   [...]
   Additionally, if a non-Querier switch spoofs any General Queries (as
 << page break >>
   addressed in Section 2.1 above, for Spanning Tree topology changes),
|  the switch should use the null IP source address (::) when sending
   said queries.  When such proxy queries are received, they must not be
   included in the Querier election process.

The term, "null" IP address is inappropriate, according to the current
IPv6 Address Architecture document.  RFC 4541 should use the proper
term, "unspecified" address (cf. Section 2.5.2 of RFC 4291).

Hence, the above text should say:

   [...]
   Additionally, if a non-Querier switch spoofs any General Queries (as
 << page break >>
   addressed in Section 2.1 above, for Spanning Tree topology changes),
|  the switch should use the unspecified IP source address (::) when
   sending said queries.  When such proxy queries are received, they
   must not be included in the Querier election process.


(2)  typo (singluar/plural mismatch)

The last paragraph of Section 3, on page 10 of RFC 4541, says:

                    vv
|  Initial allocation of IPv6 multicast addresses, as described in
|  [RFC3307], however, cover only the lower 32 bits of group ID.  [...]
                           ^^
It should say either:

   vvvv
|  The Initial allocation of IPv6 multicast addresses, as described in
|  [RFC3307], however, covers only the lower 32 bits of group ID.  [...]
                            ^
or:

   vvvv                  v
|  The Initial allocations of IPv6 multicast addresses, as described in
   [RFC3307], however, cover only the lower 32 bits of group ID.  [...]

(I also propose to include the missing article.)


(3)  related specification

Finally, I'd like to point out that the IPv6 Multicast Address
Architecture has been amended by RFC 3956.
Giving a reference to that RFC, as well as to RFC 4291, woukd have
been useful in the context of RFC 4541.


Items (1) and (2) might be suitable for an RFC Errata Note.

Preferrably, you should submit an Author's Errata Note to the
RFC Editor for publication on the RFC Errata web pages, making
freely use of the material supplied above.  But if you like,
I can formally submit an Errata Note on my own, with your consent.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
I already have sent to you a short notice about the Reference
issue with the recently published, and closely related, RFCs
4660 and 4661 (SIP Event Notification Filtering) authored by you.

Below you'll find additional comments on issues I found in these
RFCs.  I suspect having identified a significant inconsistency,
presented as item (1) below; item (2) raises a general editorial
issue; the remaining items below are presented in RFC textual
order, ready for incorporation into an RFC Errata Note.

I use change bars ('|' in column 1) and occasionally
up/down pointing marker lines ('^^^'/'vvv') to emphasize
the location of textual issues and/or proposed corrections.
Modified text has been re-adjusted to match RFC formatting
rules, where appropriate.


(1)  significant issues with filter syntax  ( ABNF in RFC 4661 )

Many of the filter examples in RFC 4661 and RFC 4660 do not conform
with the ABNF presented in Section 5, on page 11, of RFC 4661.
Further, that ABNF allows unexpected, strange instantiations of
'elem-path', and there's at least one significant semantical
ambiguity in the syntax described.

Because I am a bloody XML and XML XPATH layman, I am not in a
position to exactly diagnose what is wrong, and to quickly propose
suitable corrections, in a way that keeps the specification as
close to XPATH as possible.

I just present some of the strange outcomes of strict application
of the RFC 4661 ABNF and a few pointers to examples in the RFC
text that do not conform with that syntax.

a) ambiguous semantics / insufficient syntax

The ABNF production,

   expression = "[" (elem-expr / attr-expr)
                         1*[oper (elem-expr / attr-expr)] "]"
entails

   oper = "and" / "or"

Accordingly, these rules allow to build up expressions containing
multiple terms of the form  '(elem-expr / attr-expr)'  separated
by "and" and/or "or" operators.
There are no operator precedence rules specified, and there's no
possibility to insert parentheses to build sub-expressions / groups
to enforce the desired operator precedence.
Thus, it remains unclear whether, e.g., an expression of the form,
     [ <expr1> or <expr2> and <expr3> ]
means:
     [ <expr1> or ( <expr2> and <expr3> ) ]
(corresponding to commonly used precedence rules),
or:
     [ ( <expr1> or <expr2> ) and <expr3> ]
(corresponding to simple left-to-right operator evaluation).

b)  strange productions (#1)

The ABNF production,

   elem-path = (element / "*") 1*["/" / "*" / element] ["*" / element]

together with:

   element = [ns] string
   ns = string ":"

admits 'elem-path' values of strange and unexpected forms, e.g.,

   ****
   *<ns_string1>:<elem_string1><elem_string2><ns_strind3>:<elem_string3>

without any intervening separator characters.

I am quite sure that this was not intended.

Looking at the 'elem-path' production, it can be observed:
The construction '1*[ ... ]' apparently does not make much
sense; since a group in brackets, '[ ... ]', means "optional",
this construction would be equivalent to the simpler '*( ...)'.
Perhaps, the  '1*[ ... ]' group should look similar to the
'1*( ... )'  group in
   elem-reference =  "/" 1*("/" / "/*" / ("/" element))
including the required "/" in all alternatives.
This also make the final, optional group questionable.

c)  strange productions (#2)

The ABNF productions,
   reference = elem-reference / attr-reference
   attr-reference = reference attribute
together with:
   attribute = "@" [ns] string
   ns = string ":"
admits 'reference' values with multiple attribute references like
   <elem-reference>@<ns1>:<attr1>@<attr2>@<attr3>@<ns4>:<attr4>

I am quite sure that this was not intended.

c)  front end of examples not matching the syntax

Successive substitution of the ABNF productions of RFC 4661 leads
to the following observations:

  *  each 'elem-reference' must start with a double-slash, "//" ;
  *  each 'reference' starts with an 'elem-reference',
     and hence it must start with a double-slash;
  *  each 'selection' starts with a 'reference,
     and hence it must start with a double-slash.

Many examples do not conform to this restriction, starting from
the short examples at the bottom of page 11 up to many of the
detailed XML examples in both RFCs.

d)  back end of examples not matching the syntax

Further observations from the ABNF:
  *  (un-escaped) square brackets, "[" and "]" only appear
     in the 'expression' production, forming the leading and
     the trailing character of it, respectively;
  *  each 'selection' contains at most one 'expression', and
     this 'expression' is the trailing part of the 'selection;
  *  hence, each 'selection' contains at most one matching pair
     of square brackets, and if it does, the "]" must be the
     last character of it.

There are examples given, e.g. in Section 6.1 of RFC 4661,
on top of page 13, and in Section 6.6 of RFC 4661, on page 15,
where this restriction is not adhered to!


Final conclusion:  Apparently, all (or most) examples presented
are expected to be crafted as intended, i.e. with valid syntax.
Hence, the ABNF needs to be substantially reworked to allow
production of these examples, and to really produce exactly what
it should.  Otherwise, implementations based on the ABNF will
drastically fail, will not conform to the intended behaviour,
and will not be interoperable with implementations not based
on the ABNF of RFC 4661.


(2)  general issue: presentation/formatting of XML text

Although it carries no functional relevance, uniform formatting
and consistent indentation of XML text significantly adds to
the readability and furthers the understanding of the structure.
Unfortunately, there are many places in the two RFCs where --
perhaps as a result of the use of various tools in the publication
process -- non-uniform and inconsistent indentation in XML text
impedes the readability of the XML schemata and the XML examples.

At a minimum, pairing opening and closing XML tags, if on different
lines, should be indented by the same amount of white space,
and XML elements on the same hierarchical level (within another
XML element) should be indented equally.

For brevity of this message, I omit detailing the numerous places
affected I have marked in my printed copies of the two RFCs.


(3)  repeated word replications and grammar  (RFC 4660)

The second paragraph of Section 3.3.1 of RFC 4660, at the bottom
of page 3, says:

   A SUBSCRIBE request destined to a list URI [4] MAY include multiple
   filters specific to individual resources.  This is achieved by
   including multiple <filter> elements with different URIs of resources
|  in each of those elements.  This resource specific resource-specific
|  filter are processed first before any list specific list-specific
|  filter, if any.  The list specific list-specific filter may or may
   not include a URI.

It should perhaps say:

   A SUBSCRIBE request destined to a list URI [4] MAY include multiple
   filters specific to individual resources.  This is achieved by
   including multiple <filter> elements with different URIs of resources
|  in each of those elements.  This resource-specific filter is
|  processed first, before any list-specific filter, if any.  The
|  list-specific filter may or may not include a URI.


(4)  distorting extra blank line   (RFC4660)

The example scenario description in Section 4.1 of RFC 4660,
on top of page 8, are made less comprehensible by the additional
blank line in between:

   List1 (list1@example.com) on RLS1 has: bob@example.com

   list2@biloxi.com

Should perhaps better say:

   List1 (list1@example.com) on RLS1 has: bob@example.com
   list2@biloxi.com

or even better:

   List1 (list1@example.com) on RLS1 has:
     bob@example.com list2@biloxi.com


(5)  inappropriate Section headlines   (RFC4660)

The ToC and the body of RFC 4660 (on page 9) contains the Section
headlines:

 5.  Server Operation

 5.1.  NOTIFY Bodies

should better say:

 5.  Notifier Operation

 5.1   SUBSCRIBE Bodies

Rationale:

Obviously, these titles are inappropriate.

a) The document deals with two kinds of 'server' roles:
     *  Resource List Server (RLS),  and
     *  SIP servers in the Notifier role
   Since Section 4 deals with RLS behaviour (and does tell so
   in its headline), and Section 5 deals with Notifier behaviour,
   the latter should tell so as well, and not pretend to be
   applicable to server operation in general.

b) NOTIFY bodies/content are dealt with in Section 5.3 ff.
   As can be seen immediately, Section 5.1 talks about
   SUBSCRIBE bodies.


(6)  typo/grammar  (RFC 4660)

Within Section 5.2.1, at the bottom of page 10, RFC 4660 says:

                                 [...].  Notifiers belonging to the
|  domain MUST apply the filter to all notifications it sends for that
   subscription, unless policy dictates otherwise.
                                                     ^^^^^^^^
It should say:

                                 [...].  Notifiers belonging to the
|  domain MUST apply the filter to all notifications they send for that
   subscription, unless policy dictates otherwise.
                                                     ^^^^^^^^^


(7)  placement of text ??   (RFC 4660)

The first paragraph of Section 5.3, on page 11,

   Upon receiving the SUBSCRIBE with the filter, the notifier SHOULD
   retain the filter as long as the subscription persists.  The filter
   MAY be incorporated within an existing subscription (in an active
   dialog) by sending a re-SUBSCRIBE that includes the filter in the
   body.

apparently should have been moved up to the end of Section 5.2
because it is related to behaviour during
   "Notifier Processing of SUBSCRIBE Requests" == Section 5.2


(8)  improper use of articles  (RFC 4660)

There are two related issues with text in the 2nd and 3rd paragraph
of Section 5.3, on mid-page 11:

   If the response sent to the SUBSCRIBE was a "202" and the "202" was
|  chosen because the filter could not be accepted that time, the NOTIFY
   MAY be used to terminate the subscription if the filter is found
   unacceptable.

|  As described in [3], the NOTIFY message MAY contain a body that
   describes the state of the resource.  This body is in one of the
   formats listed in the Accept header field of the SUBSCRIBE, or in the
   package-specific default if the Accept header field is omitted.

The first occurrence of "the NOTIFY" is improper because this is the
first place the text talks about a NOTIFY message in this context.
The definite article should either be omitted entirely, or better
be replaced by "a NOTIFY message".
The second "the NOTIFY" is improper because it (re-)states a general
property of all NOTIFY messages, not of a specific NOTIFY message.
Therefore, the above text should say:

   If the response sent to the SUBSCRIBE was a "202" and the "202" was
|  chosen because the filter could not be accepted that time, a NOTIFY
   maeeage MAY be used to terminate the subscription if the filter is
   found unacceptable.

|  As described in [3], a NOTIFY message MAY contain a body that
   describes the state of the resource.  This body is in one of the
   formats listed in the Accept header field of the SUBSCRIBE, or in the
   package-specific default if the Accept header field is omitted.


(9)  missing articles  (RFC 4660)

Within Section 7.1.3, near the top of page 20, where RFC 4660 says:

   Notification containing both tuples is sent to the subscriber in this
   case:

it should better say:

|  A Notification containing both tuples is sent to the subscriber in
   this case:

and within Section 7.2.3, in the upper half of page 26, where the RFC
says:

   Notification to the subscriber is created, taking into account the
   <trigger> and <what> elements:

it should better say:

|  A Notification to the subscriber is created, taking into account the
   <trigger> and <what> elements:


(10)  punctuation/quoting  (RFC 4661)

In the 1st paragraph of Section 3.6.1, on page 8, RFC 4661 says:

   The <changed> element is used to identify the XML element or
   attribute, from the package-specific XML document, whose value MUST
   change from that of the "previous XML document", in order to activate
|  the trigger and cause the content to be delivered.  Previous XML
   document" in this context refers to the raw version of the most
   recent XML document that was sent to the subscriber, before the
   filters were applied to it.  [...]
                                                      ^^
It should say:

   The <changed> element is used to identify the XML element or
   attribute, from the package-specific XML document, whose value MUST
   change from that of the "previous XML document", in order to activate
|  the trigger and cause the content to be delivered.  "Previous XML
   document" in this context refers to the raw version of the most
   recent XML document that was sent to the subscriber, before the
   filters were applied to it.  [...]


(11)  clarification needed  (RFC 4661)

The example in Section 6.5 of RFC 4661 makes us of an XML namespace
"game-ext".
I strongly suspect that this is a hypothetical namespace; at least,
it currently does not appear in the IANA XML namespace sub-registry.
If this is the case, this fact should have been communicated to the
RFC reader, e.g. by changing the text near the bottom of page 14,

   A user wants to know if a group of his friends is available for
   gaming.  He orders notifications about the current status and future
   changes of the game-specific presence information.

to say more precisely:

   A user wants to know if a group of his friends is available for
   gaming.  He orders notifications about the current status and future
|  changes of the (hypothetical) game-specific presence information.


Please comment.

Item (1) seems to be such severe that correction is needed urgently.
I do not argue whether this can be done by an RFC Errata Note, or an
immediate revision of RFC 4661 is needed.

Perhaps, the items (3)..(11) might be addressed by an Errata Note.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
after studying RFC 4433 (Dyn. MIP4 HA Assignment) authored
by you and published a couple of months ago, I'd like to
submit a few comments.

I found one significant textual issue, and countless minor
textual flaws (typos, missing articles, grammar, etc.) in
that memo.

The former is detailed below and might be worth of an Errata
Note submitted to the RFC Editor's RFC Errata web pages;
for the moment, to save some of my spare time, I have not yet
compiled a list of the latter issues (marked on my printed
copy of the RFC).

If you would like to receive such list, in particular for later
consideration, should some time in the future any derived work
be intended, please let me know, but admit a significant delay
for my response.


(1)  wrong term used

In the 3rd paragraph of Section 5.3.1 of RFC 4433, at the bottom
of page 17, and in the headline and the table caption of Table 1,
on page 18, the RFC text uses the term "Assigned HA".
According to, e.g., the explanations in bullet 1 of Section 5.3,
this is not correct; the term to be used is "Requested HA";
it will eventually become the "Assigned HA" if the conditions
mentioned are met, but the behaviour described strictly applies
to the "Requested HA" role.

Hence:

a) The last 3 lines of page 17,

   The following table summarizes the behavior of the Assigned HA, based
   on the value of the destination IP address and Home Agent field of
   the Registration Request.

should better say (also fixing another flaw):

|  The following table summarizes the behavior of the Requested HA,
   based on the value of the destination IP address and the Home Agent
|  Address field of the Registration Request.

b) The first line of page 18 (headline of Table 1),

   Dest IP Addr   HA field      Processing at Assigned HA

should better say:

   Dest IP Addr   HA field      Processing at Requested HA

c) On mid-page 18, the line (table caption),

     Table 1: Registration Request Handling at Assigned HA

should better say:

     Table 1: Registration Request Handling at the Requested HA


Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
after studying RFC 4447 (LDP usage for PWE3) edited/authored
by you, I would like to submit a few comments, pointing out
some issues I found with the RFC text, and supplying material
for an appropriate RFC Errata Note.

The items below are presented in RFC textual order.
I use change bars ('|' in column 1) and occasionally
up/down pointing marker lines ('^^^'/'vvv') to emphasize
the location of textual issues and/or proposed corrections.
Modified text has been re-adjusted to match RFC formatting
rules, where appropriate.


(0) General Note:

Unfortunately, RFC 4447 does not precisely, verbatim, and
consistently use names and terms defined in previous
specifications and in the RFC text itself, in (subsequent)
parts of the text.
This makes it difficult for the non-specialist to keep all the
things together.
In particular, the terms/names,
   "Message" or "Message Type",
   "FEC" or "FEC TLV" (a *TLV*)
(as introduced in the basic LDP specification, RFC 3036),
   "PWid FEC Element" and "Generalized PWid FEC Element"
(introduced in Sections 5.2 and 5.3 of RFC 4447, respectively), and
   "PW Grouping ID TLV"
(introduced in Section 5.1 of RFC 4447) are used in a slaggish
manner and varied substantially later on in the text.
I only have caught some of the instances of this issue in the
list below.  Any derived work should make consistent use of the
defined terms and names, in particular in Standards Track documents!


(1)  two typos in the Abstract

The Abstract of RFC 4447 says:

                     [...].  It is also possible to use pseudowires to
   provide low-rate Time Division Multiplexed and a Synchronous Optical
   NETworking circuit emulation over an MPLS-enabled network.  This
   document specifies a protocol for establishing and maintaining the
   pseudowires, using extensions to Label Distribution Protocol (LDP).
   Procedures for encapsulating Layer 2 PDUs are specified in a set of
   companion documents.

It should perhaps better say:

                     [...].  It is also possible to use pseudowires to
   provide low-rate Time Division Multiplexed and Synchronous Optical
|  NETworking circuit emulation over an MPLS-enabled network.  This
   document specifies a protocol for establishing and maintaining the
|  pseudowires, using extensions to the Label Distribution Protocol
   (LDP).  Procedures for encapsulating Layer 2 PDUs are specified in a
   set of companion documents.


(2)  wrong term(s) used in table(s)

Within Section 5.1 of RFC 4447, on page 8, the first 2 tables say:

   This document specifies the following new TLVs to be used with LDP:

   TLV                    Specified in Section     Defined for Message
   ===================================================================
   PW Status TLV                  5.4.2            Notification
   PW Interface Parameters TLV    5.3.2.1          FEC
   PW Grouping  ID TLV            5.3.2.2          FEC


   Additionally, the following new FEC element types are defined:

   FEC Element Type        Specified in Section    Defined for Message
   ===================================================================
   0x80                            5.2             FEC
   0x81                            5.3             FEC

Apparently, "FEC" is not appropriate in the last column of the first
table, and "Defined for Message" makes no sense in the second table,
where only "FEC" appears, as "FEC" is not an LDP message, it is a TLV.
Perhaps, the latter column is dispensable, in favor of a new column
showing the name of the FEC element.

Hence, the text perhaps should better say, e.g.:

   TLV                      Specified in Section   Defined for Message
   ===================================================================
   PW Status TLV                    5.4.2          Notification
|  PW Interface Parameters TLV      5.3.2.1        with FEC TLV
|  PW Grouping ID TLV               5.3.2.2        with FEC TLV


   Additionally, the following new FEC element types are defined:

|  FEC Element Type     FEC Element Name          Specified in Section
   ===================================================================
|  0x80                 PWid                               5.2
|  0x81                 Generalized PWid                   5.3


(3)  clarification ( wrong term ?? )

Section 5.2, at the bottom of page 9, says:

   -  Group ID

      An arbitrary 32-bit value that represents a group of PWs that is
      used to create groups in the PW space.  The group ID is intended
      to be used as a port index, or a virtual tunnel index.  To
      simplify configuration, a particular PW ID at ingress could be
      part of the virtual tunnel for transport to the egress router.

I suspect (but I am not 100% sure) that "PW ID" should in fact be
"PW Group ID", i.e., that this text should say:

   -  Group ID

      An arbitrary 32-bit value that represents a group of PWs that is
      used to create groups in the PW space.  The group ID is intended
      to be used as a port index, or a virtual tunnel index.  To
|     simplify configuration, a particular PW Group ID at ingress could
      be part of the virtual tunnel for transport to the egress router.

Please comment.


(4)  clarifications

a) The title of Section 5.3.2,

 5.3.2.  Encoding the Generalized ID FEC Element

for the sake of consistency should better say:

 5.3.2.  Encoding the Generalized PWid FEC Element


b) Within Section 5.3.2, the 2nd-to-last paragraph on page 13 says:

   The PW information length field contains the length of the SAII,
   TAII, and AGI, combined in octets.  If this value is 0, then it
|  references all PWs using the specified grouping ID.  In this case,
   there are no other FEC element fields (AGI, SAII, etc.) present, nor
   any interface parameters TLVs.

To make the context more clear, it might preferrably be amended to say:

   The PW information length field contains the length of the SAII,
   TAII, and AGI, combined in octets.  If this value is 0, then it
|  references all PWs using the grouping ID (specifed in the PW grouping
|  ID TLV).  In this case, there are no other FEC element fields (AGI,
   SAII, etc.) present, nor any interface parameters TLVs.


(5)  consistency of terms

The headline of Section 5.3.2.2,

 5.3.2.2.  PW Grouping TLV

should better say, for terminological consistency:

 5.3.2.2.  PW Grouping ID TLV


(6)  clarification of term

At the end of Section 5.3.2.2, near the top of page 15, the RFC says:

   To issue a wildcard command (status or withdraw):

|  -  Set the PW Info Length to 0 in the Generalized ID FEC Element.

   -  Send only the PW Grouping ID TLV with the FEC (no AGI/SAII/TAII is
      sent).

The first bullet should be enhanced, making use of the defined terms
verbatim, as follows:

   To issue a wildcard command (status or withdraw):

|  -  Set the PW Info Length to 0 in the Generalized PWid FEC Element.

   -  Send only the PW Grouping ID TLV with the FEC (no AGI/SAII/TAII is
      sent).


(6)  message diagram incomplete

After consideration of the RFC text, I strongly suspect that the
message diagram in Section 5.4.2, at the bottom of page 17,

    0                   1                   2                   3

Rationale:
a) using defined terms verbatim
b) final TLV added: PW Grouping ID TLV


(7)  clarifications, terms and wording

Still in Section 5.4.2, the 2nd and 3rd paragraph on page 18 say:

   The PW FEC TLV SHOULD not include the interface parameter sub-TLVs,
   as they are ignored in the context of this message.  When a PE's
   attachment circuit encounters an error, use of the PW Notification
   Message allows the PE to send a single "wild card" status message,
   using a PW FEC TLV with only the group ID set, to denote this change
   in status for all affected PW connections.  This status message
   contains either the PW FEC TLV with only the group ID set, or else it
   contains the Generalized FEC TLV with only the PW Grouping ID TLV.

   As mentioned above, the Group ID field of the PWid FEC element, or
   the PW Grouping ID TLV used with the Generalized ID FEC element, can
   be used to send a status notification for all arbitrary sets of PWs.
   [...]

This text should better say:

|  The PWid FEC element SHOULD NOT include the interface parameter
   sub-TLVs, as they are ignored in the context of this message.  When
   a PE's attachment circuit encounters an error, use of the PW
   Notification Message allows the PE to send a single "wild card"
|  status message, using a PWid FEC element with only the group ID set,
   to denote this change in status for all affected PW connections.
|  This status message contains either a FEC TLV with a PWid FEC element
|  with only the group ID set, or else it contains a FEC TLV with a
|  Generalized PWid FEC element together with only the PW Grouping ID
   TLV.

   As mentioned above, the Group ID field of the PWid FEC element, or
|  the PW Grouping ID TLV used with the Generalized PWid FEC element,
   can be used to send a status notification for all arbitrary sets of
   PWs.
   [...]


(8)  typo (spurious word)

The second-to-last paragraph of Section 6.2, on page 22, says:

                          [...].  If one endpoint prefers to use the
   control word but the other does not, the one that prefers not to use
|  it is has no extra protocol to execute; it just waits for a Label
   Mapping message that has c=0.

It should say:

                          [...].  If one endpoint prefers to use the
   control word but the other does not, the one that prefers not to use
|  it has no extra protocol to execute; it just waits for a Label
   Mapping message that has c=0.


(9)  terminology

a) The first paragraph of Section 6.3, on page 22, says:

   As mentioned above, the Group ID field of the PWid FEC element, or
   the PW Grouping ID TLV used with the Generalized ID FEC element, can
   be used to withdraw all PW labels associated with a particular PW
   group.  [...]

It should say:

   As mentioned above, the Group ID field of the PWid FEC element, or
|  the PW Grouping ID TLV used with the Generalized PWid FEC element,
   can be used to withdraw all PW labels associated with a particular PW
   group.  [...]

b) The second paragraph of Section 6.3, on top of page 23, says:

   If the Generalized FEC element is used, the AGI, SAII, and TAII are
   not present, the PW information length field is set to 0, the PW
   Grouping ID TLV is included, the Interface Parameters TLV is not
   present, and the Label TLV is not present.  For the purpose of this
   document, this is called the "wild card withdraw procedure", and all
   PEs implementing this design are REQUIRED to accept such withdrawn
   message but are not required to send it.  Note that the PW Grouping
   ID TLV only applies to PWs using the Generalized ID FEC element,
   while the Group ID only applies to PWid FEC element.

It should say:

|  If the Generalized PWid FEC element is used, the AGI, SAII, and TAII
   are not present, the PW information length field is set to 0, the PW
   Grouping ID TLV is included, the Interface Parameters TLV is not
   present, and the Label TLV is not present.  For the purpose of this
   document, this is called the "wild card withdraw procedure", and all
   PEs implementing this design are REQUIRED to accept such withdrawn
   message but are not required to send it.  Note that the PW Grouping
|  ID TLV only applies to PWs using the Generalized PWid FEC element,
   while the Group ID only applies to PWid FEC element.


Please comment.

All but item (0) seems to be appropriate for an Errata Note.

Preferrably, you should submit an Author's Errata Note to the
RFC Editor's RFC Errata web pages, making freely use of the
material supplied above.  But if you like, I can formally
submit an Errata Note on my own, with your consent.

Hello,
after studying the recently published RFC 4534 (Group Security
Policy Token v1)) authored by you, I would like to submit a few
comments, pointing out some issues I found with the RFC text,
and supplying material for an appropriate RFC Errata Note.

Items (4) and (5) below apparently are ASN.1 mistakes, and
as such should be corrected as soon as possible to further
interoperable implementation.
All other items are less significant and strictly editorial
in nature.

The items below are presented in RFC textual order.
I use change bars ('|' in column 1) and occasionally
up/down pointing marker lines ('^^^'/'vvv') to emphasize
the location of textual issues and/or proposed corrections.
Modified text has been re-adjusted to match RFC formatting
rules, where appropriate.


(1)  on terminology

a)
The combination of the two roles of "Group Controller" and
"Key Server" is usually abbreviated as  "GC/KS" , and such
does RFC 4534.  Consistently, the full expansion should be
spelled  "Group Controller / Key Server"  to match the "/"
present in the acronym and to avoid the mis-understandable
unstructured word grouping, "Group Controller Key Server".

This affects Section 3.2, in the second line on page 7, and
the second line of Section B.1.1, on page 13.

b)
IMHO, the wording, "[the] rekey" is sluggish and should be
replaced by "[the] rekeying".
This affects the Section titles,
"3.3. Rekey Policy", that better should be: "3.3. Rekeying Policy"
as well as
    "B.5. GSAKMPv1 Rekey Policy"  and all
    "B.5.*. Rekey ___"  , and
    "B.6. GSAKMPv1 Rekey Policy ASN.1 Module"

Other changes:
  "rekey protocol" --> "rekeying protocol"  and
  "rekey message"  --> "rekeying message"    (Section 3, page 5),
  "Rekey SA"       --> "Rekeying SA"   and
  "During Rekey,"  --> "During Rekeying,"    (Section 3.3, page 7),
  "Rekey SAs"      --> "Rekeying SAs"        (Appendix B, page 13),
  "Rekey Protocol" --> "Rekeying Protocol" (2x) ,
  "rekey policy"   --> "rekeying policy"   (2x) ,
  "rekey messages" --> "rekeying messages" ,
  "rekey event"    --> "rekeying event"    (2x) ,
  "rekey message"  --> "rekeying message" ,
  "rekey interval" --> "rekeying interval" ,
  "rekey process"  --> "rekeying process" ,
  "the rekey"      --> "the rekeying" ,
  "rekey delivery" --> "rekeying delivery" ,
  "handle rekey."  --> "handle rekeying." ,  (all in B.5., on page 22),
  etc. ...
  "


(2)  typo (missing article)

In section 3.4, on page 8, the RFC says:

                                  [...].  There are several protocols
   that could make use of group keys, ranging from simple security
|  applications that only need key for encryption and/or integrity
   protection to more complex configurable security protocols such as
   IPsec and Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) [RFC3711].  [..]

It should say:

                                  [...].  There are several protocols
   that could make use of group keys, ranging from simple security
|  applications that only need a key for encryption and/or integrity
   protection to more complex configurable security protocols such as
   IPsec and Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) [RFC3711].  [..]


(3)  text formatting -- inappropriate indentation

Within Section B.1.3.1, the last paragraph on page 16 is unexpectedly
partially indented.
The RFC says:

   OpInfo provides configuration data for the operation of GSAKMP
       registration.  timeOut indicates the elapsed amount of time
       before a sent message is considered to be misrouted or lost.  It
       is specified as the timestamp type LifeDate, previously defined
       in the core token.  terse informs a GC/KS whether the group
       should be operated in terse (TRUE) or verbose (FALSE) mode.  The
       optional timestamp field indicates whether a timestamp (TRUE) or
       a nonce (FALSE) is used for anti-replay protection.  If the field
       is absent, the use of nonces is the default mode for GSAKMP
       registration.

It should say:

   OpInfo provides configuration data for the operation of GSAKMP
   registration.  timeOut indicates the elapsed amount of time before a
   sent message is considered to be misrouted or lost.  It is specified
   as the timestamp type LifeDate, previously defined in the core token.
   terse informs a GC/KS whether the group should be operated in terse
   (TRUE) or verbose (FALSE) mode.  The optional timestamp field
   indicates whether a timestamp (TRUE) or a nonce (FALSE) is used for
   anti-replay protection.  If the field is absent, the use of nonces is
   the default mode for GSAKMP registration.


(4)  omission in ASN.1 module

Section B.3, on pp. 20/21, gives a textual introduction with ASN.1
snippits to, and Section B.4, on pp. 21/22 gives the formal ASN.1
module for, GSAKMPv1 De-Registration.

Unfortunately, there's a significant inconsistency bewteen these
two sources of data structure and syntax.

On page 20, in Section B.3 the RFC says:

     GSAKMPv1DeRegistrationInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
       leaveMechanisms  SEQUENCE OF LeaveMechanisms,
|      terse            BOOLEAN,
       transport        Transport
     }

On page 21, in Section B.4 the RFC says:

   GSAKMPv1DeRegistrationInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
     leaveMechanisms SEQUENCE OF LeaveMechanisms,
     transport       Transport
   }

Obviously, the line
       terse            BOOLEAN,
has been lost on its way into the ASN.1 module, and should be
re-inserted to make it consistent with the text.


(5)  ASN.1 usage problems ??

a)
Section B.5.4, on page 24, defines:

     RekeyMethod ::= SEQUENCE {
       rekeyMethodType  OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
|      rekeyMethodInfo  OCTET STRING
     }

Why doesn't it use the "ANY DEFINED BY ..." syntax construct for
'rekeyMethodInfo' ?

Subsequent definitions in B.5.4.{1,2} define the syntax of
two possible instantiations of RekeyMethod, with syntax NULL
and INTEGER, respectively, for the rekeyMethodInfo element.
That doesn't match!

b)
Similarly, B.5.6, on page 25, defines:

     Reliability ::= SEQUENCE {
       reliabilityMechanism   OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
|      reliabilityMechContent OCTET STRING
     }

   The reliability mechanism is defined by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER and the
   information needed to operate that mechanism is defined as
|  reliabilityMechContent and is an OCTET STRING (as before).

whereas the subsequent definitions in B.5.6.{1,2,3} define the syntax
of three possible instantiations of Reliability, with syntax NULL,
INTEGER, and IA5String, respectively, for the reliabilityMechContent
element.
Again, that doesn't match!

c)
Finally, B.5.7, on page 26, defines:

     SubGCKSInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
       subGCKSScheme OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
|      sGCKSContent  OCTET STRING
     }

whereas the subsequent definitions in B.5.7.{1,2} define the syntax
of two possible instantiations of SubGCKSInfo, with syntax NULL and
SEQUENCE { ... }, respectively, for the sGCKSContent element.
Again, that doesn't match!


(6)  typos

a) Section B.5.4.1, on page 24, says:
                                           vv       vvv
|  The group defined to work without a rekey protocols supporting it is
   supported by the rekeyMethodType NONE.  [...]

It should say:
                                            vvvv       vv
|  The group defined to work without a rekeying protocol supporting it
   is supported by the rekeyMethodType NONE.  [...]

b) Section B.5.4.2, on page 24, says:
                                           v
|  The GSAKMP protocol specification defined an interpretation of the
   Logical Key Hierarchy (LKH) protocol as a rekey method.  [...]

It should say:
                                           v
|  The GSAKMP protocol specification defines an interpretation of the
   Logical Key Hierarchy (LKH) protocol as a rekey method.  [...]


(7)  improper term / wording

Sections B.5.6.1 and B.5.6.2, on page 25, talk about
[the reliability of] the "networks", where the text apparently
should talk about [the reliability of] the "transports"
(3 instances).


(8)  unneeded ASN.1 import

In the ASN.1 module of Section C.2, the IMPORTS clause on page 31
contains and unneeded object name and ID (perhaps copied-and-pasted
from other ASN.1 modules).
The lines,

     IMPORTS
       LifeDate
|        FROM PolicyToken {1.3.6.1.5.5.12.0.1}
|
|      KeyIdentifier
|        FROM PKIX1Implicit88 { iso(1) identified-organization(3)
|          dod(6) internet(1) security(5) mechanisms(5) pkix(7)
|          id-mod(0) id-pkix1-implicit(19) };

should be shortened to just say:

     IMPORTS
       LifeDate
|        FROM PolicyToken {1.3.6.1.5.5.12.0.1};


Please comment.

All but item (1) seems to be appropriate for an Errata Note.

Preferrably, you should submit an Author's Errata Note to the
RFC Editor's RFC Errata web pages, making freely use of the
material supplied above.  But if you like, I can formally
submit an Errata Note on my own, with your consent.

Hello,
after studying the recently published RFC 4566 (revised SDP spec.)
authored by you, I would like to submit a few comments, pointing
out some issues I found with the RFC text, and supplying material
for an appropriate RFC Errata Note.

The items below are presented in (almost) RFC textual order.
I use change bars ('|' in column 1) and occasionally
up/down pointing marker lines ('^^^'/'vvv') to emphasize
the location of textual issues and/or proposed corrections.
Modified text has been re-adjusted to match RFC formatting
rules, where appropriate.


(1)  typo

On page 7 of RFC 4566, Section 4.6 says:

   The SDP specification recommends the use of the ISO 10646 character
|  sets in the UTF-8 encoding [5] to allow many different languages to
   be represented.  However, to assist in compact representations, SDP
   also allows other character sets such as ISO 8859-1 to be used when
   desired.  Internationalisation only applies to free-text fields
   (session name and background information), and not to SDP as a whole.

It should say:

   The SDP specification recommends the use of the ISO 10646 character
|  set in the UTF-8 encoding [5] to allow many different languages to
   be represented.  However, to assist in compact representations, SDP
   also allows other character sets such as ISO 8859-1 to be used when
   desired.  Internationalisation only applies to free-text fields
   (session name and background information), and not to SDP as a whole.


(2)  inconsistent specification

Contrary to the text in Section 4.6 (see above), Section 5 of RFC 4566
specifies, at the bottom of page 7:

   An SDP session description is entirely textual using the ISO 10646
   character set in UTF-8 encoding.  SDP field names and attribute names
   use only the US-ASCII subset of UTF-8, but textual fields and
   attribute values MAY use the full ISO 10646 character set.  [...]

These conflicting specifications might become a source of
interoperability problems, and therefore, the conflict should be
resolved by a clarification !!!

Note: Subsequent text in sections 5.* specifies behaviour related
to the "a=charset" attribute required if other charsets than UTF-8
are used in certain fields; therefore, the latter exclusive UTF-8
rule is most probably too restrictive and hence inappropriate.


(3)  misleading text / inconsistency + typo (missing article)

Still in Section 5, the second-to-last paragraph on page 8 of RFC 4566
says:

   An SDP session description consists of a session-level section
   followed by zero or more media-level sections.  The session-level
   part starts with a "v=" line and continues to the first media-level
|  section.  Each media-level section starts with an "m=" line and
|  continues to the next media-level section or end of the whole session
   description.  In general, session-level values are the default for
   all media unless overridden by an equivalent media-level value.

The second sentence does not accomodate for an important corner case
mentioned in the first sentence, and thus should be amended with
similar wording as below. The third sentence is imprecise as well,
because the "or" does not uniquely select the 'right' condition.

It should better say:

   An SDP session description consists of a session-level section
   followed by zero or more media-level sections.  The session-level
   part starts with a "v=" line and continues to the first media-level
|  section (or the end of the whole description, whichever comes first).
   Each media-level section starts with an "m=" line and continues to
|  the next media-level section or the end of the whole session
|  description - whichever comes first.  In general, session-level
   values are the default for all media unless overridden by an
   equivalent media-level value.


(4)  significant mis-specification

In the "Session description" block, on top of page 9, the RFC says:

         c=* (connection information -- not required if included in
              all media)
         b=* (zero or more bandwidth information lines)

It should say:

         c=* (connection information -- not required if included in
              all media descriptions)
         b=* (zero or more bandwidth information lines)

Rationale:
Strictly differentiating between "media" and "media description"
is always required to avoid confusion! ...
And connection information is rarely (if ever) seen in the media!


(5)  improper wording related with IP addresses

IP addresses (in IPv4 and IPv6) are always assigned to an interface,
not to a host or 'machine'.  Therefore, a Standards Track RFC
should never talk about  '*the* IP address of a machine'.
FQDNs are also not necessarily unique for a 'machine', e.g. a server
having multiple, 'role-based' FQDNs.

Therefore, in Section 5.2, the last paragraph on page 11,

|  <unicast-address> is the address of the machine from which the
      session was created.  For an address type of IP4, this is either
|     the fully qualified domain name of the machine or the dotted-
|     decimal representation of the IP version 4 address of the machine.
|     For an address type of IP6, this is either the fully qualified
      domain name of the machine or the compressed textual
|     representation of the IP version 6 address of the machine.  For
      both IP4 and IP6, the fully qualified domain name is the form that
|     SHOULD be given unless this is unavailable, in which case the
      globally unique address MAY be substituted.  A local IP address
      MUST NOT be used in any context where the SDP description might
      leave the scope in which the address is meaningful (for example, a
      local address MUST NOT be included in an application-level
      referral that might leave the scope).

should say:

|  <unicast-address> is an address of the machine from which the
      session was created.  For an address type of IP4, this is either
|     a fully qualified domain name of the machine or the dotted-
|     decimal representation of an IP version 4 address of the machine.
|     For an address type of IP6, this is either a fully qualified
      domain name of the machine or the compressed textual
|     representation of an IP version 6 address of the machine.  For
      both IP4 and IP6, the fully qualified domain name is the form that
|     SHOULD be given unless this is unavailable, in which case a
      globally unique address MAY be substituted.  A local IP address
      MUST NOT be used in any context where the SDP description might
      leave the scope in which the address is meaningful (for example, a
      local address MUST NOT be included in an application-level
      referral that might leave the scope).


(6)  improper term used

a)
Section 5.6 twice uses the term, "conference", where IMHO, according
to the definitions given in Section 2, the term, "session" should
be used.  This change makes the text better conform with the
classification of the "e=" and "p=" lines on page 9, as well.

The first textual paragraph of Section 5.6, on page 13, says:

   The "e=" and "p=" lines specify contact information for the person
|  responsible for the conference.  This is not necessarily the same
|  person that created the conference announcement.

It should say:

   The "e=" and "p=" lines specify contact information for the person
|  responsible for the session.  This is not necessarily the same person
|  that created the session announcement.

b)
Another instance of this issue occurs in Section 5.7, at the bottom
of page 14.  There, the RFC says:

   o  Sessions using an IPv4 multicast connection address MUST also have
      a time to live (TTL) value present in addition to the multicast
      address.  The TTL and the address together define the scope with
|     which multicast packets sent in this conference will be sent.  TTL
      values MUST be in the range 0-255.  [...]

It should say:

   o  Sessions using an IPv4 multicast connection address MUST also have
      a time to live (TTL) value present in addition to the multicast
      address.  The TTL and the address together define the scope with
|     which multicast packets sent in this session will be sent.  TTL
      values MUST be in the range 0-255.  [...]

c)
Finally, the last sentence of the second paragraph of Section 5.13,
on page 21,

                                                   [...].  Attribute
   fields can also be added before the first media field; these
   "session-level" attributes convey additional information that applies
   to the conference as a whole rather than to individual media.

should say, accordingly:

                                                   [...].  Attribute
   fields can also be added before the first media field; these
   "session-level" attributes convey additional information that applies
|  to the session as a whole rather than to individual media.


(7)  clarification

The second paragraph of Section 5.9, on page 17, says:

   The first and second sub-fields give the start and stop times,
   respectively, for the session.  These values are the decimal
   representation of Network Time Protocol (NTP) time values in seconds
   since 1900 [13].  To convert these values to UNIX time, subtract
   decimal 2208988800.

To make the time base unique and absolute, the time zone (UTC) needs to
be specified.
Hence, the RFC should say:

   The first and second sub-fields give the start and stop times,
   respectively, for the session.  These values are the decimal
   representation of Network Time Protocol (NTP) time values in seconds
|  since 1900, UTC [13].  To convert these values to UNIX time, subtract
   decimal 2208988800.


(8)  typo (missing article)

The second text paragraph of section 5.10, on page 18, says:

   To make description more compact, times may also be given in units of
   days, hours, or minutes.  [...]

It should say:

|  To make the description more compact, times may also be given in
   units of days, hours, or minutes.  [...]


(9)  legacy term not replaced

Since the advent of SIP and the Offer/Answer Model for SDP, it is
no more appropriate, in a general context, to name a
'session description' just a 'session announcement'.

The final paragraph of Section 5.11, on page 19, says:

   If a session is likely to last several years, it is expected that the
   session announcement will be modified periodically rather than
   transmit several years' worth of adjustments in one session
   announcement.

It should say therefore:

   If a session is likely to last several years, it is expected that the
|  session description will be modified periodically rather than
|  transmitting several years' worth of adjustments in one session
|  description.


(10) clarification of 'charset' related terminology, plus typos

Section 5.13 makes use of legacy terminology related to character
sets and "charsets".  It should use the stable, IESG policy based
IETF terminology.

a)
Hence, the first paragraph on page 22:

   Attribute values are octet strings, and MAY use any octet value
   except 0x00 (Nul), 0x0A (LF), and 0x0D (CR).  By default, attribute
   values are to be interpreted as in ISO-10646 character set with UTF-8
   encoding.  Unlike other text fields, attribute values are NOT
   normally affected by the "charset" attribute as this would make
   comparisons against known values problematic.  However, when an
   attribute is defined, it can be defined to be charset dependent, in
   which case its value should be interpreted in the session charset
   rather than in ISO-10646.

should better say:

   Attribute values are octet strings, and MAY use any octet value
   except 0x00 (Nul), 0x0A (LF), and 0x0D (CR).  By default, attribute
|  values are to be interpreted as in the ISO-10646 character set with
   UTF-8 encoding.  Unlike other text fields, attribute values are NOT
   normally affected by the "charset" attribute as this would make
   comparisons against known values problematic.  However, when an
   attribute is defined, it can be defined to be charset dependent, in
   which case its value should be interpreted in the session charset
   rather than in UTF-8.

Note: RFC 1815 has been deprecated; 'ISO-10646' is *not* considered a
"charset", whereas 'UTF-8' is.

b)
In Section 6, at the bottom of page 28, the RFC says:

      a=charset:<character set>

         This specifies the character set to be used to display the
         session name and information data.  By default, the ISO-10646
         character set in UTF-8 encoding is used.  If a more compact
         representation is required, other character sets may be used.
         For example, the ISO 8859-1 is specified with the following SDP
         attribute:

            a=charset:ISO-8859-1

The above headline should say:

      a=charset:<charset>

or perhaps even better:

      a=charset:<IANA-charset>

and the text body above should be changed to say:

|        This specifies the character set and encoding ("charset") to be
|        used for the session name and information data.  By default,
|        the ISO-10646 character set in UTF-8 encoding (charset "UTF-8")
         is used.  If a more compact representation is required, other
|        charsets may be used.  For example, the ISO 8859-1 charset is
         specified with the following SDP attribute:
         [...]

Note: The session description does not determine how parts of it
are *displayed* (theres may be some transcoding used, and fonts
or typefaces, etc., the charset must only be specified for SDP.)

The subsequent text on page 29,

         This is a session-level attribute and is not dependent on
         charset.  The charset specified MUST be one of those registered
         with IANA, such as ISO-8859-1.  The character set identifier is
         a US-ASCII string and MUST be compared against the IANA
         identifiers using a case-insensitive comparison.  If the
         identifier is not recognised or not supported, all strings that
         are affected by it SHOULD be regarded as octet strings.

         Note that a character set specified MUST still prohibit the use
         of bytes 0x00 (Nul), 0x0A (LF), and 0x0d (CR).  Character sets
         requiring the use of these characters MUST define a quoting
         mechanism that prevents these bytes from appearing within text
         fields.

should be changed to say (fixing typos as well):

         This is a session-level attribute and is not dependent on
         charset.  The charset specified MUST be one of those registered
|        with IANA, such as ISO-8859-1.  The charset identifier is a
         US-ASCII string and MUST be compared against the IANA
         identifiers using a case-insensitive comparison.  If the
         identifier is not recognised or not supported, all strings that
         are affected by it SHOULD be regarded as octet strings.

|        Note that a charset specified MUST still prohibit the use of
|        bytes 0x00 (NUL), 0x0A (LF), and 0x0D (CR).  Charsets requiring
         the use of these characters MUST define a quoting mechanism
         that prevents these bytes from appearing within text fields.


(11)  language related issues, plus typos

The RFC text on pp. 29/30 does not properly distinguish between, and
messes up, the specifics of session content (and its language[s]) and
the session *description* content (and the language[s] used therein).

Note: I show more context than absolutely necessary to perform the
recommended changes, to make these better understandable.

a)
On mid-page 29, RFC 4566 says:

      a=sdplang:<language tag>

         This can be a session-level attribute or a media-level
         attribute.  As a session-level attribute, it specifies the
         language for the session description.  As a media-level
         attribute, it specifies the language for any media-level SDP
         information field associated with that media.  Multiple sdplang
         attributes can be provided either at session or media level if
|        multiple languages in the session description or media use
|        multiple languages, in which case the order of the attributes
|        indicates the order of importance of the various languages in
|        the session or media from most important to least important.

(The last half-sentence is wrong and inappropriate.)

It should better say:

      a=sdplang:<language tag>

         This can be a session-level attribute or a media-level
         attribute.  As a session-level attribute, it specifies the
         language for the session description.  As a media-level
         attribute, it specifies the language for any media-level SDP
         information field associated with that media.  Multiple sdplang
         attributes can be provided either at session or media level if
|        multiple languages in the session or media description use
|        multiple languages.

b)
Skipping one paragraph, the next one says:

         The "sdplang" attribute value must be a single RFC 3066
         language tag in US-ASCII [9].  It is not dependent on the
         charset attribute.  An "sdplang" attribute SHOULD be specified
|        when a session is of sufficient scope to cross geographic
         boundaries where the language of recipients cannot be assumed,
|        or where the session is in a different language from the
         locally assumed norm.

It should say:

         The "sdplang" attribute value must be a single RFC 3066
         language tag in US-ASCII [9].  It is not dependent on the
         charset attribute.  An "sdplang" attribute SHOULD be specified
|        when a session description is of sufficient scope to cross
         geographic boundaries where the language of recipients cannot
|        be assumed, or where the session description is in a different
         language from the locally assumed norm.

c)
Next, in the explanations for:

      a=lang:<language tag>

extending from page 29 to page 30,

         This can be a session-level attribute or a media-level
         attribute.  As a session-level attribute, it specifies the
         default language for the session being described.  As a media-
         level attribute, it specifies the language for that media,
  <<page break>>
         overriding any session-level language specified.  Multiple lang
         attributes can be provided either at session or media level if
|        the session description or media use multiple languages, in
         which case the order of the attributes indicates the order of
         importance of the various languages in the session or media
         from most important to least important.

should be corrected to say:

         This can be a session-level attribute or a media-level
         attribute.  As a session-level attribute, it specifies the
         default language for the session being described.  As a media-
         level attribute, it specifies the language for that media,
  <<page break>>
         overriding any session-level language specified.  Multiple lang
         attributes can be provided either at session or media level if
|        the session or media use multiple languages, in which case the
         order of the attributes indicates the order of importance of
|        the various languages in the session or media, from most
         important to least important.




Note: In the meantime (since the publication of RFC 4566), RFC 3066
has been superseded by RFC 4646 plus RFC 4647, now together denoted
as BCP 47.


(12)  typo

On page 31, in the second paragraph of Section 7, RFC 4566 says:

            [...].  Many different transport protocols may be used to
   distribute session description, and the nature of the authentication
   will differ from transport to transport.  [...]

It should say:

            [...].  Many different transport protocols may be used to
|  distribute session descriptions, and the nature of the authentication
   will differ from transport to transport.  [...]


(13)  SDP Grammar issues  (ABNF in Section 9, p. 39 ff.),

a)
The rule for 'repeat-interval'  (page 41)  could easily have
re-used (incorporated) the 'integer' rule:

   repeat-interval =     POS-DIGIT *DIGIT [fixed-len-time-unit]

is equivalent to:

   repeat-interval =     integer [fixed-len-time-unit]

b)
The rule for FQDN, at the bottom of page 42, is wrong;
FQDNs really should allow up to 255 characters!
                         v
|  FQDN =                4*(alpha-numeric / "-" / ".")
                         ; fully qualified domain name as specified
                         ; in RFC 1035 (and updates)

Because details are not gived (can be found at other places),
this rule should perhaps be only minimally corrected to say:

|  FQDN =                *(alpha-numeric / "-" / ".")
                         ; fully qualified domain name as specified
                         ; in RFC 1035 (and updates)


These comments have grown to a magnitude initially not expected;
perhaps, my last proofreading round has suffered from the daytime
reached in the meantime; thus, I apologize for any remaining
typos or inconsistencies left in this lengthy comment.  :-)

Please comment.

All items seem to be appropriate for an Errata Note.
At a minimum, serious issues should be addressed,
e.g. (2), (10), (11), and the ABNF mistake (13b).

Preferrably, you should submit an Author's Errata Note to the
RFC Editor's RFC Errata web pages, making freely use of the
material supplied above.  But if you like, I can formally
submit an Errata Note on my own, with your consent.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
after studying the recently published RFC 4678 (SASPv1)
authored by you, I would like to submit a few comments, pointing
out some issues I found with the RFC text, and supplying material
for an appropriate RFC Errata Note.

The items below are presented in RFC textual order.
I use change bars ('|' in column 1) and occasionally
up/down pointing marker lines ('^^^'/'vvv') to emphasize
the location of textual issues and/or proposed corrections.
Modified text has been re-adjusted to match RFC formatting
rules, where appropriate.


(1)  formatting

[ This note might just be of interest in deriving further work. ]

Most (but not all) "ruler lines" above message / data format diagrams
in RFC 4678 do not conform with the pattern in the RFC authoring guide.
The lines,

|     0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      | ...                                                           |

should be indented as:

|      0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      | ...                                                           |


(2)  unclear / misleading wording

On page 18, at the end of Section 7.1, RFC 4678 says:

                                                  [...].  Even though
   registrations can come from either the load balancer/scheduler or the
   actual member, member-initiated registrations will only be considered
|  if the Trust flag is set while the state of the load
|  balancer/scheduler is set.

The last two lines are far from being clear, or even misleading,
at first reading.
It becomes clear what perhaps was intended to say there as well
when arriving at Section 7.2 that says (at the bottom of page 20):

                                        ... will only be considered if
|  the Trust flag is set with a Set LB State message.

Perhaps, it would have been even better if both quotations would have
been changed to say (emphasizing the temporal relationship of events):

                                        ... will only be considered if
|  the Trust flag has been set with a Set LB State message.


(3)  incomplete specification

Section 7.3.2, in the first bullet on page 26,

   o  Interval: These two bytes indicate a recommended polling interval
      for the load balancer to use.  The Group Workload Manager is
      stating that any polling interval smaller than the suggested
      interval would probably retrieve values before they have had a
      chance to change.

does not mention the intended *unit* for this Interval -- seconds /
centiseconds / milliseconds ???


(4)  two significant typos

I strongly suspect that the type codes specified in Section 7.5.2
and Section 7.6.2 are wrong (duplicates from Section 7.2.2 ??)
Probably, Section 7.2, on page 6, gives the right values.

Therefore,
I propose to post an RFC Errata Note with the following content:

----  begin  RFC 4678 errata  ----

(a)
In Section 7.5.2, in the diagram on top of page 29, RFC 4678 says:

      [...]
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|     | Set Member State Reply(0x1025)|Size of SetMemberStateReply TLV|
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |  Return Code  |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

It should say:
                                   v
      [...]
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|     | Set Member State Reply(0x1065)|Size of SetMemberStateReply TLV|
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |  Return Code  |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

(b)
In Section 7.6.2, in the diagram on top of page 32, RFC 4678 says:

      [...]
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|     |   Set LB State Reply (0x1025) | Size of Set LB State Reply TLV|
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |  Return Code  |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

It should say:
                                  v
      [...]
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|     |   Set LB State Reply (0x1055) | Size of Set LB State Reply TLV|
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |  Return Code  |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

----  end    RFC 4678 errata  ----


Please comment.

All but item (1) seems to be appropriate for an Errata Note
-- I have set up a proposal for item (4), whereas items (2) and
(3) need your input;

Preferrably, you should submit an Author's Errata Note to the
RFC Editor's RFC Errata web pages, making freely use of the
material supplied above.  But if you like, I can formally
submit an Errata Note on my own, with your (input and) consent.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
studying the recently published RFC 4647 (EAP-PAX) authored by you,
I found a couple of textual issues, two of which seem to be rather
significant.

After presenting these two issues, further typos are reported
in RFC textual order.

I use change bars ('|' in column 1) and occasionally up/down
pointing marker lines ('^^^'/'vvv') to emphasize the location
of textual issues and/or proposed corrections.


(1)  IMPORTANT -- wrong data length specified !

On top of page 18, Section 3.2 says:
          v
|  These 52+L octets are then attached to the packet as the payload.
   [...]

It should say:
          v
|  These 54+L octets are then attached to the packet as the payload.
   [...]

Rationale: cf. preceding text (page 16), and Figure 8 (page 18)!


(2)  IMPORTANT - misleading text / missing unit !

The 1st paragraph of Section 4.3.7, on page 22, contains the sentence:

                  [...].  Consequently, EAP-PAX requires the use of a
|  Diffie-Hellman group with modulus larger than 3000.  [...]
                                                 ^^^^^
It should say instead:

                  [...].  Consequently, EAP-PAX requires the use of a
|  Diffie-Hellman group with modulus larger than 3000 bits.  [...]

Rationale: evident!


(3)  [typo]

On page 6 of RFC 4647, the 1st paragraph of Section 2.1 says:

   PAX_STD is a simple nonce-based authentication using the strong
   long-term key.  [...]

It should say:

|  PAX_STD is a simple nonce-based authentication using a strong
   long-term key.  [...]


(4)  [grammar]

Within Section 2.2, near the bottom of page 8, RFC 4647 says:

   When using EAP-PAX with Wireless LAN, clients SHOULD validate that
   the certificate's wlanSSID extension matches the SSID of the network
   to which it is currently authenticating.

It should say either:

|  When using EAP-PAX with a Wireless LAN, clients SHOULD validate that
   the certificate's wlanSSID extension matches the SSID of the network
   to which it is currently authenticating.

or:

|  When using EAP-PAX with Wireless LANs, clients SHOULD validate that
   the certificate's wlanSSID extension matches the SSID of the network
   to which it is currently authenticating.


(5)  [missing article]

On page 9, the 1st paragraph of Section 2.3 says:

   Messages PAX_STD-2, PAX_STD-3, PAX_SEC-4, PAX_SEC-5, and PAX_ACK
   contain optional component ADE.  [...]

It should say:

   Messages PAX_STD-2, PAX_STD-3, PAX_SEC-4, PAX_SEC-5, and PAX_ACK
|  contain an optional component ADE.  [...]


(6)  [extraneous word]

The 2nd paragraph of Section 4, at the bottom of page 19, says:

                                          [...].  Also note that the
   security of PAX can be proved using under the Random Oracle model.

It should say either:
                                          [...].  Also note that the
|  security of PAX can be proved under the Random Oracle model.

or:
                                          [...].  Also note that the
|  security of PAX can be proved using the Random Oracle model.


Please comment.

In particular, items (1) and (2) seem to deserve an Errata Note.

Preferrably, you should submit an Author's Errata Note to the
RFC Editor's RFC Errata web pages, making freely use of the
material supplied above.  But if you like, I can formally
submit an Errata Note on my own, with your consent.

Hello,
the recent publication of RFC 4746 (EAP-PAX) has caused me to
also study RFC 4186 (EAP-SIM) authored by you.
There, I found a couple of textual issues, at least two of which
seem to be rather significant.

After first presenting these two most important issues, further
flaws are reported in RFC textual order.

I use change bars ('|' in column 1) and occasionally up/down
pointing marker lines ('^^^'/'vvv') to emphasize the location
of textual issues and/or proposed corrections.


(1)  IMPORTANT -- mis-specification of a protocol limit

Section 8.1, near the bottom of page 46, contains the explanation:

   Length

         Indicates the length of this attribute in multiples of four
|        bytes.  The maximum length of an attribute is 1024 bytes.  The
         length includes the Attribute Type and Length bytes.

This is wrong.  It should say:

   Length

         Indicates the length of this attribute in multiples of four
|        bytes.  The maximum length of an attribute is 1020 bytes.  The
         length includes the Attribute Type and Length bytes.
                                                         ^^
Rationale:
  As there is no offset defined, the maximum encoded Length value
  of 255 corresponds to a total of 4*255 = 1020 octets.
Note:
  Other protocols incorporate an offset of -1 in similar cases, e.g.,
  when a TLV Length field comprises the length of the 'T' and 'L',
  also removing the artificially designed-in error case (Length=0),
  that otherwise must be checked for by all implementations!
  Some people speak of bad protocol design when encountering
  Length fields that do not indicate the true length of an object
  value proper, which might be zero.


(2)  IMPORTANT -- misleading specification !

On page 62, the 2nd paragraph of Section 10.14 says:

   The value field of the AT_MAC attribute contains two reserved bytes
   followed by a keyed message authentication code (MAC).  The MAC is
|  calculated over the whole EAP packet and concatenated with optional
   message-specific data, with the exception that the value field of the
   MAC attribute is set to zero when calculating the MAC.  [...]

It should say:

   The value field of the AT_MAC attribute contains two reserved bytes
   followed by a keyed message authentication code (MAC).  The MAC is
|  calculated over the whole EAP packet, concatenated with optional
   message-specific data, with the exception that the value field of the
   MAC attribute is set to zero when calculating the MAC.  [...]

Rationale:
  "The MAC is calculated ... and concatenated ..."
could easily be misunderstood.
>From the context it can be concluded that the potential ambiguity
should be resolved and clarified by omitting the word 'and',
and replacing it by a comma.


(3)  [missing article]

Within Section 1, the 2nd paragraph on page 5 says:

   EAP-SIM specifies optional support for protecting the privacy of
   subscriber identity using the same concept as the GSM, which uses
   pseudonyms/temporary identifiers.  [...]

It should say:

|  EAP-SIM specifies optional support for protecting the privacy of the
   subscriber identity using the same concept as the GSM, which uses
   pseudonyms/temporary identifiers.  [...]


(4)  [missing article]

Section 2, near the bottom of page 6, says:

   Fast Re-authentication Username

         The username portion of fast re-authentication identity,
         i.e., not including any realm portions.

It should say:

   Fast Re-authentication Username

|        The username portion of the fast re-authentication identity,
         i.e., not including any realm portions.


(5)  [missing article]

(7)  [misleading continuation indicator]

In Section 4.3.6, Figure 7 (on page 29) contains for lines that

Figure 7 was split over two pages; after joining the parts,
these continuation indicators have become ambiguous, and hence
should be deleted.

Please comment.

At least, items (1) and (2) -- and perhaps (7) and (9) as well --
seem to deserve an Errata Note.

Preferrably, you should submit an Author's Errata Note to the
RFC Editor's RFC Errata web pages, making freely use of the
material supplied above.  But if you like, I can formally
submit an Errata Note on my own, with your consent.

Hello,
the recent publication of RFC 4746 (EAP-PAX) has caused me to
also study RFC 4187 (EAP-AKA) authored by you.
There, I found a couple of textual issues, I'd like to comment on.

Below, these flaws are reported in RFC textual order.

I use change bars ('|' in column 1) and occasionally up/down
pointing marker lines ('^^^'/'vvv') to emphasize the location
of textual issues and/or proposed corrections.


(1)  [misleading wording]

In Section 3, the RFC text at the bottom of page 13 says:

            [...].  In certain circumstances, shown in Figure 4, it is
   possible for the sequence numbers to get out of sequence.

This sentence is misleading. Figure 4 only shows the *discovery*
of the de-synchronization; it does not show 'certain circumstances'
that might lead to this problem.


(2)  [typo]

On page 18, the second paragraph of Section 4.1.1.7 says:

                                                         [...].  It is
   recommended that the EAP servers implement some centralized mechanism
   to allow all EAP servers of the home operator to map pseudonyms
|  generated by other severs to the permanent identity.  [...]

   authentication.  [...]

   do not process this attribute.  [...]

The second paragraph of Section 4.1.4, on mid-page 23, says:

   If the server chooses to not ignore the contents of
|  EAP-Response/Identity, then the server may already receive an EAP-AKA
|  identity in this packet.  However, if the EAP server has not received
   any EAP-AKA peer identity (permanent identity, pseudonym identity, or
   fast re-authentication identity) from the peer when sending the first
   EAP-AKA request, or if the EAP server has received an
   EAP-Response/Identity packet but the contents do not appear to be a
   valid permanent identity, pseudonym identity, or a re-authentication
   identity, then the server MUST request an identity from the peer
   using one of the methods below.

It should say:

   an EAP-Response/Identity packet but the contents do not appear to be
   a valid permanent identity, pseudonym identity, or a
   re-authentication identity, then the server MUST request an identity
   from the peer using one of the methods below.


(7)  [misleading wording]

On page 25, the first paragraph of Section 4.1.6 says:

   The section above specifies two possible ways the peer can operate
   upon receipt of AT_PERMANENT_ID_REQ because a received
   AT_PERMANENT_ID_REQ does not necessarily originate from the valid
|  network.  However, an active attacker may transmit an
   EAP-Request/AKA-Identity packet with an AT_PERMANENT_ID_REQ attribute
   to the peer, in an effort to find out the true identity of the user.
   If the peer does not want to reveal its permanent identity, then the
   peer sends the EAP-Response/AKA-Client-Error packet with the error
   code "unable to process packet", and the authentication exchange
   terminates.

It should say:

   The section above specifies two possible ways the peer can operate
   upon receipt of AT_PERMANENT_ID_REQ because a received

(15)  [missing article]

Section 9, on page 48 says:

|                           [...].  Message format is specified in
   Section 8.1.

It should say:

|                           [...].  The message format is specified in
   Section 8.1.


(16)  IMPORTANT -- misleading specification !

On page 63, the 2nd paragraph of Section 10.15 says:

   The value field of the AT_MAC attribute contains two reserved bytes
   followed by a keyed message authentication code (MAC).  The MAC is
|  calculated over the whole EAP packet and concatenated with optional
   message-specific data, with the exception that the value field of the
   MAC attribute is set to zero when calculating the MAC.  [...]

It should say:

   The value field of the AT_MAC attribute contains two reserved bytes
   followed by a keyed message authentication code (MAC).  The MAC is
|  calculated over the whole EAP packet, concatenated with optional
   message-specific data, with the exception that the value field of the
   MAC attribute is set to zero when calculating the MAC.  [...]

Rationale:
  "The MAC is calculated ... and concatenated ..."
could easily be misunderstood.  From the context it can be
concluded that the potential ambiguity should be resolved and
clarified by omitting the word 'and', and replacing it by a comma.


(17)  [improper, extraneous wording]

In Section 10.15, the second-to-last paragraph on page 63 says:

|  The MAC algorithm is HMAC-SHA1-128 [RFC2104] keyed hash value.  (The
   HMAC-SHA1-128 value is obtained from the 20-byte HMAC-SHA1 value by
   truncating the output to 16 bytes.  Hence, the length of the MAC is
   16 bytes.)  The derivation of the authentication key (K_aut) used in
   the calculation of the MAC is specified in Section 7.

It should say:

|  The MAC algorithm is HMAC-SHA1-128 [RFC2104].  (The HMAC-SHA1-128
   value is obtained from the 20-byte HMAC-SHA1 value by truncating the
   output to 16 bytes.  Hence, the length of the MAC is 16 bytes.)  The
   derivation of the authentication key (K_aut) used in the calculation
   of the MAC is specified in Section 7.

Rationale: Beyond grammar, don't mess up 'algorithm' and 'value' !


(17)  [missing article]

The second text paragraph of Section 10.18, on page 65, says:

   The value field of the AT_NONCE_S attribute contains two reserved
   bytes followed by a random number (16 bytes) that is freshly
   generated by the server for this EAP-AKA fast re-authentication.  The
   random number is used as challenge for the peer and also as a seed
   value for the new keying material.  [...]

It should say:

   The value field of the AT_NONCE_S attribute contains two reserved
   bytes followed by a random number (16 bytes) that is freshly
   generated by the server for this EAP-AKA fast re-authentication.  The
|  random number is used as a challenge for the peer and also as a seed
   value for the new keying material.  [...]


(18)  [misleading wording]

Within Section 11, the second text paragraph on page 67 says:

                        [...].  The following attribute types are
   specified in this document in [EAP-SIM]:
                             ^
It should say:

                        [...].  The following attribute types are
|  specified in this document and in [EAP-SIM]:
                             ^^^^^

(19)  [text too pessimistic?]

The second paragraph of Section 12.7, on page 71/72, says:

   As described in Section 8, EAP-AKA allows the protocol to be extended
   by defining new attribute types.  When defining such attributes, it
   should be noted that any extra attributes included in
   EAP-Request/AKA-Identity or EAP-Response/AKA-Identity packets are not
 <<page break>>
   included in the MACs later on, and thus some other precautions must
   be taken to avoid modifications to them.

IMHO, according to the rules specified in Section 10.13, application
of the AT_CHECKCODE attribute should generally rule out this issue!


Please comment.

Whereas most items just should be noted for consideration when
preparing future derived work, at least items (8), (11), and (16)
seem to deserve an Errata Note.

Preferrably, you should submit an Author's Errata Note to the
RFC Editor's RFC Errata web pages, making freely use of the
material supplied above.  But if you like, I can formally
submit an Errata Note on my own, with your consent.

Best regards,

Hello,
studying the recently published RFC 4689 (Traffic Ctl Terminology)
authored by you, I found a severe issue with the treatment of ECN.

In Section 3.1.3, at the bottom of page 5, RFC  4689 says:

                 [...].  [Ra99] implies that it is impractical to build
      a black-box test to observe Incipient Congestion.  [Ra99] instead
      introduces Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) as a
      deterministic Black-Box method for observing Incipient Congestion.
|     [Ra99] is an Experimental RFC with limited deployment, so ECN is
|     not used for this particular methodology.  [...]

and Section 6.2, on page 32, contains the Informative Reference:

   [Ra99] Ramakrishnan, K., Floyd, S., and D. Black, "The Addition of
          Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP", RFC 3168,
          September 2001.

I suspect that something has gone badly wrong there during updating
of the references:

RFC 3168 is a PROPOSED STANDARD that officially has updated RFC 793,
RFC 2474, and RFC 2401 (the latter update has been incorporated in
the meantime into the successor of RFC 2401, RFC 4301), and hence,
ECN should *not* be ignored in the discussion.

My suspicion has been triggered initially by the formal mismatch of
"Ra99" and the publication month of RFC 3168, "September 2001".
Looking into RFC 3168 and/or the RFC index, it can be seen that
RFC 3168 has obsoleted RFC 2481, which in fact was an EXPERIMENTAL
RFC and has been published in January 1999.

Additionally, ECN has been inluded into further Transport Protocol
specifications on the IETF Standards Track.

The marked statement in the quotation from RFC 4689 perhaps has been
appropriate in the timeframe from 1999 until late 2001, when targeted
to RFC 2481, but it isn't any more, when targeted to RFC 3168.

Altogether, IMHO the quoted text in RFC 4689 is very much outdated,
and it should better have been updated before publication of the
memo as an RFC.


Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

I believe that there are errata in RFC4684

s3.2 of this RFC seems to have lost a word or two where it says

'and the Next-hop attribute shall be set of the local
        address for that session.'

Changing 'set of' to 'set to' does not help as it begs the question what
session?  Route reflectors have BGP sessions with route reflector clients, other
route reflectors and with other BGP speakers that are not involved with route
reflection.  Looking at the I-D, this is precisely the end of a line and I
wonder if it is a line or two of text that has gone missing.  So change of to to
and I might raise an erratum on the grounds that it does not make sense:-)

s4 "As the origin-as field cannot be interpreted as a prefix." I cannot parse as
a sentence (note that, in this memo, 'as' is sometimes the English conjunction,
sometimes an abbreviation for Autonomous System)

s6 "withdrawls" (indicative of a Texas accent?)

As ever, I have e-mailed the authors direct; as ever, they have not responded.

Overall, this seems a poor memo, much of it hard to understand because it does
not spell out in sufficiently clear language what concepts it is referring to,
that is, it is aimed at an expert audience who already know what it says; but
that comment will have to wait for a -bis.

Following Henry's suggestion, I have slightly reworked my original
notes.  Most of the original text already had been formatted for
easy incorporation in an errata note; additional explanatory text,
'Rationale', and 'Notes' have been cut off now.  The single open
question (item (19) for RFC 4187) is now addressed with a concrete
text proposal, incorporating wording from Henry's response.
[ Henry: please double check again! ]

Enclosed you find two attachments with the concise errata text.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

These are the errata notes for RFC 4186 (EAP-SIM).
The more significant issues are marked with an emphasized headline
like:  "++++  <kind of issue>  ++++"

Change bars ('|' in column 1) and occasional up/down pointing
marker lines ('^^^'/'vvv') are used to emphasize the location
of the textual issues and/or the corrections.


(1)  ++++  mis-specification of a protocol limit  ++++

Section 8.1, near the bottom of page 46, contains the explanation:

   Length

         Indicates the length of this attribute in multiples of four
|        bytes.  The maximum length of an attribute is 1024 bytes.  The
         length includes the Attribute Type and Length bytes.

This is wrong.  It should say:

   Length

         Indicates the length of this attribute in multiples of four
|        bytes.  The maximum length of an attribute is 1020 bytes.  The
         length includes the Attribute Type and Length bytes.
                                                         ^^

(2)  ++++  misleading specification  ++++

On page 62, the 2nd paragraph of Section 10.14 says:

   The value field of the AT_MAC attribute contains two reserved bytes
   followed by a keyed message authentication code (MAC).  The MAC is
|  calculated over the whole EAP packet and concatenated with optional
   message-specific data, with the exception that the value field of the
   MAC attribute is set to zero when calculating the MAC.  [...]

It should say:

   The value field of the AT_MAC attribute contains two reserved bytes
   followed by a keyed message authentication code (MAC).  The MAC is
|  calculated over the whole EAP packet, concatenated with optional
   message-specific data, with the exception that the value field of the
   MAC attribute is set to zero when calculating the MAC.  [...]


(3)  [missing article]

Within Section 1, the 2nd paragraph on page 5 says:

   EAP-SIM specifies optional support for protecting the privacy of
   subscriber identity using the same concept as the GSM, which uses
   pseudonyms/temporary identifiers.  [...]

It should say:

|  EAP-SIM specifies optional support for protecting the privacy of the
   subscriber identity using the same concept as the GSM, which uses
   pseudonyms/temporary identifiers.  [...]


(4)  [missing article]

Section 2, near the bottom of page 6, says:

   Fast Re-authentication Username

         The username portion of fast re-authentication identity,
         i.e., not including any realm portions.

It should say:

   Fast Re-authentication Username

|        The username portion of the fast re-authentication identity,
         i.e., not including any realm portions.


(5)  [missing article]

The first paragraph of Section 4.2.3, on page 19, says:

   If EAP-SIM peer is started upon receiving an EAP-Request/Identity
   message, then the peer MAY use an EAP-SIM identity in the EAP-

   by defining new attribute types.  When defining such attributes, it
   should be noted that any extra attributes included in
   EAP-Request/AKA-Identity or EAP-Response/AKA-Identity packets are not
 <<page break>>
   included in the MACs later on, and thus some other precautions must
   be taken to avoid modifications to them.

This text is too pessimistic.  The reader's attention should be
directed to Section 10.13 of the RFC.  The (late) introduction of
the AT_CHECKCODE concept, as explained there, has taken care of
this issue; implementations should make use of this attribute.

The RFC should better say:

   As described in Section 8, EAP-AKA allows the protocol to be extended
   by defining new attribute types.  When defining such attributes, it
   should be noted that the AT_CHECKCODE attribute (see Section 10.13)
   can be used to achieve the protection of extra attributes included in
   EAP-Request/AKA-Identity or EAP-Response/AKA-Identity packets.

Hello,
Last weekend, I quickly browsed through the recently published
RFC 4695 (RTP MIDI) authored by you and John Wawrzynek.
Because you are named as the "(corresponding author)", this note
is only CC'ed to John.

While most of that huge document seems to be very carefully
crafted, I found a few (perhaps distorting) word omissions.
And even worse, unfortunately the (normative) SDP ABNF specified
in Appendix D of RFC 4695 contains a bunch of rules contradicting
the textual descriptions in the body of that memo (and even the
comments included in the ABNF!), and it violates fundamental
rules of the ABNF specification, RFC 4324.

Altogether, the literal SDP ABNF from RFC 4695 apparently does
*not* formalize the SDP attribute grammar described in the text,
and most probably intended as such.  Although, at first glance,
most of the RFC 4695 ABNF pretends to correctly reflect the
latter, intended grammar, plain application of the specific
rules from RFC 4324 shows that it doesn't.

The most fundamental issue is the improper use of the RFC 4324
coding conventions (-- admittedly uncommon and perhaps unexpected
for the non-specialist --) for ABNF terminals (code points),
which makes many RFC 4695 ABNF terminals represent something
quite different than what most probably was intended:
Numerical (in particular, *decimal*) ABNF literals represent code
points (for octets, in this case), and are therefore restricted to
the appropriate value range (i.e. 0..255 for octets); they cannot
be used to represent sequences of (ASCII) characters (digits)
having the intuitive semantical interpretation of a base-c (e.g.,
decimal) representation of (potentially large) numbers; and ABNF
quoted string literals are *not* 'C'-like string literals, they are
explicitely case *in*sensitive ASCII; in ABNF, case sensitive text
literals MUST be represented individually (character by character),
in numerical form!

Due to lack of time, I do not present the details at this time,
but I hope to find the time to study and cross check all that
stuff, and send you detailed comments, including a proposal for
a revised version of Appendix D, until early January 2007.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hi Alfred,

	Thank you for taking the time to read over the
document and find these errors.  Is it OK with you
if I post your email on the Audio-Video Transport
working group?  Since RFC 4695 is a product of that
group, the decision on what to do next (generate
an errata or create a replacement RFC) begins with them,
since the most limited resource in the process is AVT
co-chair attention (AVT runs a lot of documents, and
even with 3 co-chairs there is never enough time in
their schedules).

	Thanks, and I look forward to your more complete
analysis in 2007.

We sent in the attached message containing RFC 4340 errata in July, and 
as of today, I cannot find the errata on your errata page.  Just 
checking to see that it didn't disappear into the void.

I have some errata for RFC 4340 to report.  See the attached.

Thanks very much for your work!

Thanks to Alfred Hoenes for reporting several errors in RFC4340.

One technical omission has been found concerning the FGSR and FGSS
variables used to detect reordering of feature negotiation options.  We
suggest adding the following paragraph to the end of Section 6.6.4, on Page
42.


   FGSR and FGSS values always satisfy FGSR <= GSR and FGSS <= GSS,
   where GSR and GSS are the Greatest Sequence Numbers Received by and
   Sent from this endpoint.  These constraints MUST be enforced even
   when GSR and GSS wrap, as they might in a long connection.
   Implementations SHOULD thus check FGSR and FGSS after every packet
   received or sent, as follows.  (Wmax is the maximum allowed value for
   the Sequence Window feature; see Section 7.5.2.)

         If FGSR > GSR, then FGSR := GSR - Wmax.
         If FGSS > GSS, then FGSS := GSS - Wmax.

   Alternate implementations that correctly handle sequence number
   wrapping are also acceptable.



Typos and editorial clarifications include:

In Section 6.6.4, Page 41, it says:

              (Change and/or Confirm).  This value is initialized to
              ISR - 1.

It should say:

              (Change and/or Confirm).  This value is initialized to
              ISR - 1, where ISR is the Initial Sequence Number Received
              from the other endpoint.  (ISR and other sequence number
              variables are defined in Section 7.1.)

In Section 6.6.4, Page 41, it says:

              reordering.  FGSS is initialized to ISS.

It should say:

              reordering.  FGSS is initialized to ISS, the Initial
              Sequence Number Sent by this endpoint.


In Section 7.5.2, Page 49, it says:

    getting out sync after bursts of loss,

It should say:

    getting out of sync after bursts of loss,


In Section 8.1.2, Page 60, it says:

            intepreting the four-character result as a 32-bit big-endian

It should say:

            interpreting the four-character result as a 32-bit big-endian


In Appendix A, Page 116, it says:

    right to left.  The implementation maintains five variables, aside

It should say:

And it says:

Hello RFC editor,

Attached is an erratum for RFC 4342.  Thanks very much for including 
this on the erratum page.

Eddie Kohler & Sally Floyd


RFC 4342, "Profile for Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP)
Congestion Control ID 3: TCP-Friendly Rate Control (TFRC)"

Reported By: Sally Floyd and Eddie Kohler, from Gerrit Renker
Date: 17 December 2006

Section 5, 7th paragraph:
Explanation: Clarification of round-trip time measurement

It states:
    The sender's measurement of the round-trip time uses the Elapsed Time
    and/or Timestamp Echo option contained in feedback packets, as
    described in Section 8.2. The Elapsed Time option is required, while
    the Timestamp Echo option is not.  The sender maintains an average
    round-trip time heavily weighted on the most recent measurements.

It should say:
    The sender uses DCCP's mechanisms to measure round-trip times.  This
    includes Elapsed Time and/or Timestamp Echo options, and as described
    in Section 8.2, feedback packets MUST carry Elapsed Time options.
    Senders MAY additionally make use of other available RTT
    measurements, including those from the initial Request-Response
    packet exchange.  This differs from [RFC3448], which constrains RTT
    measurement to feedback packets only.  For CCID 3 calculations, the
    sender uses an average round-trip time heavily weighted on the most
    recent measurements.

Hello,

browsing through the recently published RFCs 4733 & 4734
authored by you (and your Ref. [17] of RFC 4733 for
complimentary information as well), I found a significant
inconsistency in the IANA registration information for
the "audio-telephone-event-registry" subregistry,
and also a few other, less significant textual issues.

The latter are presented in RFC textual order below, after
discussion of the former, significant issue.

I use change bars ('|' in column 1) and occasionally
up/down pointing marker lines ('^^^'/'vvv') to emphasize
the location of textual issues and/or proposed corrections.


(1)  [ IANA information inconsistent ]

Overview and Rationale:

Section 7 of RFC 4733, in the lower half of page 39,
specifies the initial content of the IANA maintained
audio-telephone-event-registry subregistry, as intended
for after publication of RFC 4733 -- see (1a) below.

Additionally, in Appendix A, on page 47, RFC 4733 restates this
information and summarizes the disposition of the legacy event
code assignments from the obsoleted RFC 2833, in particular,
Table 8 represents the current assignments and dispositions,
as per RFC 4733 -- see (1b) below.

Unfortunately, there are significant inconsistencies between
these two text blocks.  Looking into Ref. [17] of RFC 4733,
the ietf-avt-rfc2833biscas draft, it turns out that both
text blocks are also inconsistent with that future RFC.
Consequently, the current IANA file is also affected.


------  Begin  RFC 4733 Errata Note #1  ------

(1a)

Section 7 of RFC 4733, in the lower half of page 39, says:

   Legal event codes range from 0 to 255.  The initial registry content
   is shown in Table 7, and consists of the sixteen events defined in
   Section 3 of this document.  The remaining codes have the following
   disposition:

|  o  codes 17-22, 50-51, 90-95, 113-120, 169, and 206-255 are available
      for assignment;
                                                   ^^^

   o  codes 23-40, 49, and 52-63 are reserved for events defined in
      [16];

|  o  codes 121-137 and 174-205 are reserved for events defined in [17];
                   ^        ^^^
                          vv             v
|  o  codes 16, 41-48, 64-88, 96-112, 138-168, and 170-173 are reserved
      in the first instance for specifications reviving the
      corresponding RFC 2833 events, and in the second instance for
      general assignment after all other codes have been assigned.

It should say:

   Legal event codes range from 0 to 255.  The initial registry content
   is shown in Table 7, and consists of the sixteen events defined in
   Section 3 of this document.  The remaining codes have the following
   disposition:

      for assignment;
                                                   ^^^

   o  codes 23-40, 49, and 52-63 are reserved for events defined in
      [16];

|  o  codes 121-137, 144-159, and 174-211 are reserved for events
      defined in [17];
                   ^^^^^^^^^^         ^^^
                          vv             vvvvvvvvvv
|  o  codes 16, 41-48, 64-89, 96-112, 138-143, 160-168, and 170-173 are
      reserved in the first instance for specifications reviving the
      corresponding RFC 2833 events, and in the second instance for
      general assignment after all other codes have been assigned.

------  End    RFC 4733 Errata Note #1  ------


The current version of the IANA audio-telephone-event-registry
subregistry, as just obtained from the IANA web site, reflects
the information in (1a), contains a few spurious parts of the
table framing from the I-Ds/RFCs, and also is out-of-date by
still referring to the I-Ds, and not the published information
sources, RFC 4733 and RFC 4734.

Authors, please verify, and arrange with the IANA to correct
the published subregistry.

In particular, IMHO in the IANA subregistry:
(i)   the entry for code 64-88 (Reserved) should be extended to
      include the code 89, i.e., code range 64-89 (Reserved);
(ii)  the code range 144-159 should be split off
      the code range 138-168 (Reserved) and marked
      (Reserved for [draft-ietf-avt-rfc2833biscas]), leaving
      two ranges, 138-143 and 145-168 marked as (Reserved);
(iii) the code range 206-211 should be
      removed from the range 206-255 (Unassigned) and added to the
      range 174-205 (Reserved for [draft-ietf-avt-rfc2833biscas]),
      changing these ranges to 212-255 and 174-211, respectively;
(iv)  "[RFC-ietf-avt-rfc2833bis-15.txt]" should be updated to
      point to RFC 4733 (using the respective rfc-ref.txt line);
(v)   "[RFC-ietf-avt-rfc2833bisdata-15.txt]" should be updated to
      point to RFC 4734 (using the respective rfc-ref.txt line);
(vi)  the line for code 23 should be cleaned up.


(2)  [typo / word omission]

------  Begin  RFC 4733 Errata Note #2  ------

In the 2nd-to-last line on page 20 of RFC 4733, the phrase,

                ... the current duration of tone signal ...
should be:
|               ... the current duration of a tone signal ...
                                           ^^^

------  End    RFC 4733 Errata Note #2  ------


(3)  [typo]

------  Begin  RFC 4733 Errata Note #3  ------

In the second line of the second paragraph of Section 8, on
mid-page 43 of RFC 4733, the name,

                         Magnus Westerland
should be spelled:
|                        Magnus Westerlund
                                       ^

------  End    RFC 4733 Errata Note #3  ------


Authors, please verify and comment.

Perhaps all three items should be addressed by an Errata Note.

Preferrably, you should submit an Author's Errata Note to the
RFC Editor's RFC Errata web pages, making freely use of the
material supplied above.  If you like, please instruct the
RFC Editor (which will be CC'ed this message) to just literally
extract the marked errrata text from above, for this purpose.

Hi

This is a trivial typo, but I would also like if possible to be put in touch with the authors to know what is going on, if anything, in terms of making this proposed standard an actual standard.

RFC 3281
Page 16

the paragraph in question is...

   Note: [X.509-2000] defines the extension syntax as a "SEQUENCE OF
   Targets".  Conforming AC issuer implementations MUST only produce one
   "Targets" element.  Confirming AC users MUST be able to accept a
   "SEQUENCE OF Targets".  If more than one Targets element is found in
   an AC, the extension MUST be treated as if all Target elements had
   been found within one Targets element.

Confirming -> Conforming

I am also a bit confused as to why a user MUST be able to accept a non-conforming issuer...

Regards

Gidon

Thanks for that, looks like a fine thing to note in the
errata if you bother with typos for that. (I'll mail
Gidon separately on the other stuff.)

Hello,
after studying the recently published RFC 4583 (SDP for BFCP)
authored by you, I would like to point out a textual issue
I found in that memo, recurring in two 'flavors'.

It's always the abuse of language, talking about an SDP attribute
as being used "in" an SDP 'm' line, where in fact the attribute is
just a media-level attribute, occurring as a standalone line in an
SDP media description, i.e. the SDP part introduced by the particular
'm' line.

This is, at best, a bit confusing.


(1)  [clarification]

Section 4 of RFC 4583, near the top of page 4, says:

   If an 'm' line in an offer contains a 'floorctrl' attribute, the
   answerer MUST include one in the corresponding 'm' line in the
   answer.  [...]

It should better say:

   If a SDP media description in an offer contains a 'floorctrl'
   attribute, the answerer accepting that media MUST include one in the
   corresponding media description of the answer.  [...]


(2)  [clarification]

Section 6 of RFC 4583, on mid-page 5, says:

   The 'floorid' attribute is used in BFCP 'm' lines.  [...]

It should better say:

   The 'floorid' attribute is used in the SDP media description for BFCP
   media.  [...]


Please comment.

To address these issues, preferrably you should submit an Author's
Errata Note to the RFC Editor's RFC Errata web pages, making freely
use of the material supplied above.  But if you like, I can formally
submit an Errata Note on my own, with your consent.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
after studying the recently published RFC 4758 (CT-KIP) authored
by you, I would like to submit a few comments, pointing out some
inconsitencies and other issues I found with the RFC text, and
supplying material for an appropriate RFC Errata Note.

The items below are presented in RFC textual order.
I use change bars ('|' in column 1) and occasionally
up/down pointing marker lines ('^^^'/'vvv') to emphasize
the location of textual issues and/or proposed corrections.


(1)  [simple typo]

The second paragraph of Section 3.7.1, on page 13, says:
                                        vv
|  The XML format for CT-KIP messages have been designed to be
   extensible.  [...]

It should say:
                                        v
|  The XML format for CT-KIP messages has been designed to be
   extensible.  [...]


(2)  [XML schema inconsistencies]

The XML Schema fragment presented in Section 3.8.2 is
inconsistent with the full XML Schema in Appendix A
(cf. page 43).
Cross-checking with the examples presented in Appendix B and
looking for similarities, I strongly suspect that the second-to-last
line on page 17 of RFC 4758 is spurious and should be deleted.
Furthermore, there is a spurious (non-declared) namespace prefix
appearing on page 18 that should be deleted as well.

Hence:

(2a)

The final 3 lines at the bottom of page 17,

     </xs:sequence>
|    <xs:attribute name="id" type="xs:ID"/>
   </xs:complexType>

in fact should say:

     </xs:sequence>
   </xs:complexType>

(2b)

The final two XML schema lines on mid-page 18,
                                        vvvvvvv
|    <xs:attribute name="Version" type="ct-kip:VersionType"/>
   </xs:complexType>

in fact should say:

|    <xs:attribute name="Version" type="VersionType"/>
   </xs:complexType>


(3)  [misleading text ??]

The bullet on mid-page 22, within Section 3.8.4 of RFC 4758, says:

|  o  <MacAlgorithm>: The MAC algorithm to be used by the CT-KIP server.
                                        ^^^^^^
I suspect (but I am not 100% sure) that it should better say:

|  o  <MacAlgorithm>: The MAC algorithm used by the CT-KIP server.

Please check.


(4)  [selection of data formats]

Section 3.8.6 and the XML Schema in Appendix A *require* the use
of image data formats partly entangled with IPR issues, for the
<ServiceLogo> : image/gif and image/jpeg.
The IETF once has developed the open image/png format (RFC 2083)
as an Internet Standard alternative, in particular for use over
HTTP.

I'd therefore appreciate this popular format being allowed as well
in future revisions of the specification.


(5)  [another XML Schema inconsistency]

The XML Schema fragment in Section 3.9.3 refers to a non-existent
base type.  The correction needed is nearly obvious.

Near the bottom of page 28, the XML Schema lines,

     <xs:complexContent>
|      <xs:extension base="ExtensionType">
         <xs:sequence>
                          ^^
should say:

     <xs:complexContent>
|      <xs:extension base="AbstractExtensionType">
         <xs:sequence>
                          ^^^^^^^^^^

(6)  [yet another XML Schema inconsistency]

The XML Schema in Appendix A apparently has been truncated in an
amusing way.
The full text needed can be retrieved from page 21 of the RFC.

In the lower half of page 42, RFC 4758 says:

   <xs:complexType name="PayloadType">
     <xs:annotation>
\      <xs:documentation xml:lang="en">
/      </xs:documentation>
     </xs:annotation>

It should say:

   <xs:complexType name="PayloadType">
     <xs:annotation>
       <xs:documentation xml:lang="en">
|        Currently, only the nonce is defined.  In future versions,
|        other payloads may be defined, e.g., for one-roundtrip
|        initialization protocols.
       </xs:documentation>
     </xs:annotation>


(7)  [XML errors in examples]

The CT-KIP Message examples in Appendix B contain two significant
XML errors.

(7a)

At the beginning of Section B.2, on mid-page 46, RFC 4758 says:

   <CT-KIPTrigger
     xmlns= [...]

Apparently, the XML start line has been dropped. The RFC should say:

|  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <CT-KIPTrigger
     xmlns= [...]

(7b)

In Section B.4, an inappropriate Status value is supplied,
contrary to the text in Section 3.8.4 -- cf. 'Status' bullet
in the upper half of page 22.

In Section B.4, on mid-page 47, RFC 4758 says:

   <ServerHello
     xmlns=
   "http://www.rsasecurity.com/rsalabs/otps/schemas/2005/12/ct-kip#"
     xmlns:ds="http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#"
     xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
|    Version="1.0" SessionID="4114" Status="Success">
                                            ^^^^^^^
It should say:

   <ServerHello
     xmlns=
   "http://www.rsasecurity.com/rsalabs/otps/schemas/2005/12/ct-kip#"
     xmlns:ds="http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#"
     xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
|    Version="1.0" SessionID="4114" Status="Continue">
                                            ^^^^^^^^

(8)  [mathematical clarification]

Appendix D repeatedly uses the "ROUND" function where in fact it
should use the "CEIL" function (3 instances: on pp. 49, 51, and 52).

Admittedly, the prose text says talks about "rounding up", but who
looks at the prose when the formula is so clear ??

To eliminate the ambiguity, this issue should be clarified.


Please comment.

All but item (4), and item (3) if I am wrong there, seem to be
appropriate for an Errata Note.

Preferrably, you should submit an Author's Errata Note to the
RFC Editor's RFC Errata web pages, making freely use of the
material supplied above.  But if you like, I can formally
submit an Errata Note on my own, with your consent.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,

I report an error in RFC791.
It could be a typo but on a numerical number as it concern binary number 
and this number is wrong.

In  RFC 791 : INTERNET PROTOCOL,
section 3 :SPECIFICATION,
sub-section 3.1: Internet Header Format
page 21, in the description of the Stream Identifier
there is a table and in the second cell a binary number

which says:  00000010

it should say:  00000100


below is the whole table:
the table say:
 

        +--------+--------+--------+--------+
        |10001000|00000010|    Stream ID    |
        +--------+--------+--------+--------+
         Type=136 Length=4

it should say:

        +--------+--------+--------+--------+
        |10001000|00000100|    Stream ID    |
        +--------+--------+--------+--------+
         Type=136 Length=4



Rationale:

This number count the length which is 4 and not 2.
10 in binary is 2 in decimal, 100 in binary is 4 in decimal.

The option-length octet counts the option-type octet and the 
option-length octet as well as the option-data octets.(see page 15)
The length is 4 for the Stream identifier option as we have 4 bytes and 
it is well written in page 16 of RFC 791:

The following internet options are defined:

      CLASS NUMBER LENGTH DESCRIPTION
      ----- ------ ------ -----------
        0     0      -    End of Option list.  This option occupies only
                          1 octet; it has no length octet.
        0     1      -    No Operation.  This option occupies only 1
                          octet; it has no length octet.
        0     2     11    Security.  Used to carry Security,
                          Compartmentation, User Group (TCC), and
                          Handling Restriction Codes compatible with DOD
                          requirements.
        0     3     var.  Loose Source Routing.  Used to route the
                          internet datagram based on information
                          supplied by the source.
        0     9     var.  Strict Source Routing.  Used to route the
                          internet datagram based on information
                          supplied by the source.
        0     7     var.  Record Route.  Used to trace the route an
                          internet datagram takes.
        0     8      4    Stream ID.  Used to carry the stream
                          identifier.
        2     4     var.  Internet Timestamp.

Dear RFC Editor,

The following issues have been found in the recently published RFC 4758=20
and I have verified them, and the suggested remedy. Many Thanks to Alfred=
=20
H=F6nes for spotting these errors.

1. The second paragraph of Section 3.7.1, on page 13, says:

   The XML format for CT-KIP messages have been designed to be
   extensible.

It should say:

   The XML format for CT-KIP messages has been designed to be
   extensible.

2. The final 3 lines at the bottom of page 17,

      </xs:sequence>
      <xs:attribute name=3D"id" type=3D"xs:ID"/>
    </xs:complexType>

should be:

      </xs:sequence>
    </xs:complexType>

3. The final two XML schema lines on mid-page 18,

      <xs:attribute name=3D"Version" type=3D"ct-kip:VersionType"/>
    </xs:complexType>

should be:

      <xs:attribute name=3D"Version" type=3D"VersionType"/>
    </xs:complexType>

4. Near the bottom of page 28, the XML Schema lines,

    <xs:complexContent>
      <xs:extension base=3D"ExtensionType">
        <xs:sequence>

should be:

    <xs:complexContent>
      <xs:extension base=3D"AbstractExtensionType">
         <xs:sequence>

5.  The following text in the lower half of page 42,

    <xs:complexType name=3D"PayloadType">
      <xs:annotation>
        <xs:documentation xml:lang=3D"en">
        </xs:documentation>
      </xs:annotation>

should be (documentation was missing):

    <xs:complexType name=3D"PayloadType">
      <xs:annotation>
        <xs:documentation xml:lang=3D"en">
         Currently, only the nonce is defined.  In future versions,
         other payloads may be defined, e.g., for one-roundtrip
         initialization protocols.
      </xs:documentation>
    </xs:annotation>

6. The example at the beginning of Section B.2, on mid-page 46,

    <CT-KIPTrigger
      xmlns=3D [...]

should be:

    <?xml version=3D"1.0" encoding=3D"UTF-8"?>
    <CT-KIPTrigger
      xmlns=3D [...]

7. The example in Section B.4, on mid-page 47,

    <ServerHello
      xmlns=3D
      "http://www.rsasecurity.com/rsalabs/otps/schemas/2005/12/ct-kip#"
      xmlns:ds=3D"http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#"
      xmlns:xsi=3D"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
      Version=3D"1.0" SessionID=3D"4114" Status=3D"Success">

should be (note end of last line):

    <ServerHello
      xmlns=3D
      "http://www.rsasecurity.com/rsalabs/otps/schemas/2005/12/ct-kip#"
      xmlns:ds=3D"http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#"
      xmlns:xsi=3D"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
      Version=3D"1.0" SessionID=3D"4114" Status=3D"Continue">

8. Appendix D repeatedly uses the "ROUND" function where in fact it
should use the "CEILING function (3 instances: on pp. 49, 51, and 52).

Section 4.2 says:
 
   <dialog-info xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:dialog-info"
    xmlns:xsi=" <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance>
http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
     xsi:schemaLocation="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:dialog-info"
     version="1" state="full">

It should be:
 
   <dialog-info xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:dialog-info"
    xmlns:xsi=" <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance>
http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
     xsi:schemaLocation="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:dialog-info"
     version="1" state="full" entity="sip:alice@example.com">

Rationale:
According to the schema in section 4.4 the attribute "entity" must appear on
element "dialog-info".

        </dialog>
        <dialog id="as7d900as8" call-id="a84b4c76e66710"
                local-tag="1928301774" remote-tag="hh76a"

        </dialog>

It should be (or something similar with the id values differing):
 
      <?xml version="1.0"?>
      <dialog-info xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:dialog-info"
                   version="2"
                   state="full"
                   entity="sip:alice@example.com">
        <dialog id="1000" call-id="a84b4c76e66710"
                local-tag="1928301774" remote-tag="456887766"
                direction="initiator">
          <state>early</state>
        </dialog>
        <dialog id="1001" call-id="a84b4c76e66710"
                local-tag="1928301774" remote-tag="hh76a"
                direction="initiator">
          <state>early</state>
        </dialog>
      </dialog-info>
 
 
Rationale:
 
Quote from RFC 4235:
 
"4.1.1.  Dialog Element
 
    ...
 
   For a caller, the id is created when an INVITE request is sent.  When
   a 1xx response with a tag, or a 2xx response is received, the dialog
   is formally created.  The id remains unchanged.  However, if an
   additional 1xx or 2xx is received, resulting in the creation of
   another dialog (and resulting FSM), that dialog is allocated a new
   id.

    ..."
 
The id of the dialog is a hash value of the call-id, local-tag and
remote-tag
of the dialog. Therefore, the values of the ids in the example MUST not be
identical.

The lines in section 6.2 on pages 28, 29 (2x) and 30 are: 
 
          <state reason="cancelled">terminated</state>
 
          <state reason="replaced">terminated</state>
 
           <state reason="replaced">confirmed</state>
 
          <state reason="remote-bye">terminated</state>
 
 
and should be:
 
          <state event="cancelled">terminated</state>
 
          <state event="replaced">terminated</state>
 
           <state event="replaced">confirmed</state>
 
          <state event="remote-bye">terminated</state>
 
Rationale:
The "state" element does not have a "reason" attribute. It is called "event"
by definition
in section 4.1.2. and the schema in 4.4.

Hello AVT WG chairs,

	This email is to let you know that
a few weeks after RFC 4695 (RTP MIDI)
was issued by the RFC Editor (CC'd),
Alfred Hines (also CC'd) thoughtfully sent
in an extensive list of errata, after reading
the document in a very thorough way (thanks!).
I do not believe he was following the AVT WG
process for RTP MIDI, so first he had heard
of the protocol when the RFC was released.

	Thankfully, the serious errata did not
involve bugs in the protocol itself, but rather
pointed out places where the ABNF for
the parameters defined in Appendix D
did not match the normative text in the
document.  Most of these errors should
be easily detected by an implementor who
is paying attention (in some cases the errors
are in the form of non-sensical ABNF; in other
cases the ABNF directly contradicts the comments
in the ABNF surrounding the incorrect rule, etc).

	However, there are a substantial number
of these errors (7 ABNF errors that are normative
in nature). And so, it brings up the issue of whether
the right thing to do is to use the RFC Errata
process to document them, or to start work on
a bis version of RFC 4695.

	To help you evaluate the situation, I have
created a candidate -00.txt document for a bis
version of RFC 4695.  The document itself
includes my proposed fixes for all errors; the
Change Log at the end of the document lists
each issue Alfred presented, and my response
to the issue.

	You can download this candidate I-D here
(which has NOT been submitted to internet-drafts@ietf.org
as of this time):

http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~lazzaro/files/ietf/draft-lazzaro-avt-rtp- 
midi-format-bis-00.txt

	There is also a colored HTML diff available,
showing the differences between RFC 4695 in the
I-D format, and the candidate -00.txt bis I-D:

http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~lazzaro/files/ietf/fbis-diff.html

	Please let me know where you think we should
go from here.  Options would seem to be:

[1] Send the 00.txt I-D to internet-drafts as a personal I-D.

[2] Send the 00.txt I-D to internet-drafts as an official AVT
WG I-D.

[3] Use the RFC Errata process to document these errors
instead of a new RFC.

	I'm happy going either way -- preparing this document
was the hard work, and that's done now.

	Thanks in advance,

This errata document is now available for download:

http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~lazzaro/files/ietf/errata-00.txt

The errata gives brief descriptions of the errors that
are of particular interest to implementors, and points
the reader to <draft-ietf-avt-rfc4695-bis-00.txt>, the
the bis I-D for RFC 4695, for more complete details.
I submitted this I-D tonight.

I believe this concludes the processing of this
Errata, thanks to everyone for their help.

Hi,

The first item already exists as an errata.

What is the outlook for getting the errata updated?

Hello,
studying the recently published RFC 4788 (EVRCB)
authored by you, and comparing it with similar recent
publications,  I'm surprised to find a quite unusual
syntax used in the 'a=fmtp' SDP lines there.

Usually, media type parameters included into 'a=fmtp' SDP lines
are separated by semicolons as in the MIME type declaration.

The most recent RFC formally specifying this behaviour was
RFC 4749, Section 6.2 of which says:

   o  Any remaining parameters go in the SDP "a=fmtp" attribute by
      copying them directly from the media type string as a semicolon
      separated list of parameter=value pairs.

As another example, RFC 4396, in section 9.1, explicitely specifies
the syntax as:
        a=fmtp:<dynamic payload type>
               <parameter name>=<value>[,<value>]
               [; <parameter name>=<value>]

Note: This is *not* ABNF, as can be ssen from the context there.
      Matching RFC-4234 ABNF should have been stated there as:
        a=fmtp:<dynamic-payload-type>
               <parameter-name> "=" <value> *("," <value>)
               *(";" <parameter-name> "=" <value> *("," <value>))

This was common practice over many years.

Section 6.7 of RFC 4788 deviates from this practice, omitting
the semicolon in the examples.  From the prose description,
it is not quite clear whether the phrase,
    "... copying it directly from the MIME media type string"
was meant to comprise the separating semicolons often considered
part of MIME type parameters as well, or not.
Unfortunately, no precise formal description (ABNF) is given.
The examples given all omit the usual semicolons, e.g.:

     a=fmtp:97 silencesupp=1 dtxmax=32 dtxmin=12 hangover=1
                            ^         ^         ^

Has this omission been done intentionally?

If yes, what have been the reasons to do so?
  I fear that the unusual definition might cause
  interoperability problems; at least it makes the use
  of uniform parsing of 'a=fmtp' SDP lines impossible.

If no, the error should immediately be addressed by an
  RFC Errata Note!


Please comment!

I apologize for not having found the time to study your draft
and catch this issue before the publication of RFC 4788.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hi!

I just noticed, that there is an error in section 4 of RFC 4143 (the=20
example for the ifax enum entry).

The present example is:

       $ORIGIN 4.3.2.1.6.7.9.8.6.4.e164.arpa
         IN NAPTR 10 10 "u" "E2U+ifax:mailto"
                                "!^.*$!mailto:toyo@example.com!"

This NAPTR record is missing the REPLACEMENT field (see RFC 3403). The=20
correct example should be:

       $ORIGIN 4.3.2.1.6.7.9.8.6.4.e164.arpa
         IN NAPTR 10 10 "u" "E2U+ifax:mailto"
                                "!^.*$!mailto:toyo@example.com!" .

(Note the additional point at the end of the example.)

Hi,
 
where RFCs 2939 and 2489 reference RFC 2142 it should be
actually RFC 2242, the title of the reference is correct.

Regards, Frank

P.S.:  Something's wrong with the RFC interest mailing list.

Apparently I can post via GMaNe, but since about 2006-09-05
nothing arrived at GMaNe.  I've asked the GMaNe administration
to subscribe again, AFAIK they tried this, but it didn't help.

GMaNe "thinks" that the address is rfc-interest@ as stated
on http://www.rfc-editor.org/mailman/listinfo/rfc-interest
and http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.ietf.rfc.interest

The last message (excl. crossposts) in the GMaNe archive is
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.ietf.rfc.interest/151/raw

Later messages (one posted via GMaNe) never made it to GMaNe:
http://www.rfc-editor.org/pipermail/rfc-interest/2006-December/date.html
No message at all in January 2007, is the mailing list dead ?

Hello,
after studying the recently published RFC 4763 (EAP-SAKE)
authored by you, I would like to submit a few comments, pointing
out the issues I found with the RFC text, and supplying material
for an appropriate RFC Errata Note.

The items below are presented in RFC textual order.
I use change bars ('|' in column 1) and occasionally
up/down pointing marker lines ('^^^'/'vvv') to emphasize
the location of textual issues and/or proposed corrections.
Modified text has been re-adjusted to match RFC formatting
rules, where appropriate.


(1)  Section 3.1 -- word omission

The first bullet in Section 3.1, on mid-page 4, says:
                   v
|  o It is based on well-established Bellare-Rogaway mutual
     authentication protocol.

It should say:
                   vvvvv
|  o It is based on the well-established Bellare-Rogaway mutual
     authentication protocol.

BTW: Wouldn't that have deserved a proper reference ???


(2)  Section 3.2.6.1 -- URGENT algorithmic correction

Unfortunately, Section 3.2.6.1 contains a bad legacy mistake.
Like a couple of related documents, it does not properly set
the repetition count needed for the partitioning of a message
into fixed-size blocks, by substituting the 'FLOOR' function
where the 'CEILING' or 'CEIL' function would be needed.

To most easily see what's wrong, try substituting  Length := 16
(hence, a single 20-octet HMAC-SHA1 result is needed to cover
the requested size), and observe the controlling loop:

           for i := 0 to FLOOR(Length/20)-1 do
becomes:
           for i := 0 to FLOOR(16/20)-1 do
which is:
           for i := 0 to 0-1 do
or:
           for i := 0 to -1 do

and hence no H-SHA1 calls are ever performed.

The simple rule-of-thumb is:
  - you need FLOOR if you want to fit fixed-size pieces into a bag;
  - you need CEIL[ING] if you want to cover a bag with fixed-size pieces.

These are the changes to make the algorithm in Section 3.2.6.1 work
as intended:

In the first paragraph on page 16, where the RFC says:

   The KDF is a keyed hash function with key "Key" and operating on
   input "Label | Msg".  The convention followed herein is that
|  concatenation is denoted by |, FLOOR denotes the floor function, and
   [x...y] denotes bytes x through y.

it should say:

   The KDF is a keyed hash function with key "Key" and operating on
   input "Label | Msg".  The convention followed herein is that
|  concatenation is denoted by |, CEIL denotes the ceiling function,
   and [x...y] denotes bytes x through y.

The code block at the end of Section 3.2.6.1 :

   KDF(Key, Label, Msg, Length)
   R := []  ;; null string
|  for i := 0 to FLOOR(Length/20)-1 do
|  R := R | H-SHA1(Key, Label, Msg, i)
   return R[0...(Length-1)]

should properly state:

   KDF(Key, Label, Msg, Length)
   R := []  ;; null string
|  for i := 0 to CEIL(Length/20)-1 do
|    R := R | H-SHA1(Key, Label, Msg, i)
   return R[0...(Length-1)]

[ Note: I also have indented the statement making up the body
        of the loop to cleraly identify this property. ]


(3)  Section 3.2.8.2 -- clarification needed

Within Section 3.2.8.2, the second paragraph on page 20 says:

   The default encryption algorithm, as described in Section 3.2.8.3,
   requires the length of the plaintext to be a multiple of 16 bytes.
   The sender MAY need to include the AT_PADDING attribute as the last
|  attribute within the value field of the AT_ENCR_DATA attribute.  The
   length of the padding is chosen so that the length of the value field
   of the AT_ENCR_DATA attribute becomes a multiple of 16 bytes.  The
   AT_PADDING attribute SHOULD NOT be included if the total length of
   other attributes present within the AT_ENCR_DATA attribute is a
   multiple of 16 bytes.  The length of the AT_PADDING attribute
   includes the Attribute Type and Attribute Length fields.  The actual
   pad bytes in the value field are set to zero (0x00) on sending.  The
   recipient of the message MUST verify that the pad bytes are zero
   after decryption and MUST silently discard the message otherwise.

It should say:

   The default encryption algorithm, as described in Section 3.2.8.3,
   requires the length of the plaintext to be a multiple of 16 bytes.
   The sender MAY need to include the AT_PADDING attribute as the last
|  attribute within the plaintext of the value field of the AT_ENCR_DATA
   attribute.  The length of the padding is chosen so that the length of
   the value field of the AT_ENCR_DATA attribute becomes a multiple of
   16 bytes.  The AT_PADDING attribute SHOULD NOT be included if the
   total length of other attributes present within the AT_ENCR_DATA
   attribute is a multiple of 16 bytes.  The length of the AT_PADDING
   attribute includes the Attribute Type and Attribute Length fields.
   The actual pad bytes in the value field are set to zero (0x00) on
   sending.  The recipient of the message MUST verify that the pad bytes
   are zero after decryption and MUST silently discard the message
   otherwise.

Note:
The proper distinction between the plaintext and the ciphertext
version of fields that are encrypted in its on-the-wire form should be
heavily emphasized; neglecting this distinction can lead to significant
interoperability problems and catastrophic cryptographic failures!


(4)  Section 3.3.1 -- lack of specification, and a word omission

Unfortunately, the RFC has not been cleaned up after IANA allocation
and remains unspecific und indeterminate on the protocol constant
(EAP method type)  EAP-SAKE (=48).

In Section 3.3.1, the explanation:

   Type

      To be assigned.

should say:

   Type

|     EAP-SAKE (=48)


At the end of Section 3.3.1, the explanation:

   Subtype

      EAP-SAKE subtype: SAKE/Challenge, SAKE/Confirm, SAKE/Auth-Reject,
      and SAKE/Identity.  All messages of type "EAP-SAKE" that are not
|     of these subtypes MUST silently discarded.
      [...]                          ^

should say:

   Subtype

      EAP-SAKE subtype: SAKE/Challenge, SAKE/Confirm, SAKE/Auth-Reject,
      and SAKE/Identity.  All messages of type "EAP-SAKE" that are not
|     of these subtypes MUST silently be discarded.
      [...]                          ^^^^


(5)  Section 3.3.2 -- format, and incomplete specification

The inadvertent blank line near the end of the table on page 24
has no functional meaning and hence should be deleted.

At the end of the section, below the table, add the sentence:

   The attribute type values assigned by this specification (and
   registered by the IANA) are listed in section 4.

Note:
  Below, I have chosen to supply the missing values explicitely,
  rather than proposinf to repeatedly add similar pointers to Sct. 4.
  This seems to better serve the needs of the reader and hopefully
  will aid the implementer as well.


(6)  Section 3.3.3 -- lack of specification, and artwork improvement

For uniformity, *all* constant values should be made visible in
the message format diagrams.
The rationale of item (4) above applies as well.

The figure in Section 3.3.4, on page 26, contains the initial part:

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   |    ...

It should say:

   |    ...

The explanation:

   Type

|     EAP-SAKE

should say:

   Type

|     EAP-SAKE (=48)

At the end of the section, on page 27, the explanations:

|  AT_RAND_S

      The value field of this attribute contains the Server nonce RAND_S
      parameter.  The RAND_S attribute MUST be present in
      EAP.Request/SAKE/Challenge.

|  AT_SERVERID

      The value field of this attribute contains the Server identifier
      (e.g., a non-null terminated string).  The AT_SERVERID attribute
      SHOULD be present in EAP.Request/SAKE Challenge.

should say:

|  AT_RAND_S (=1)

      The value field of this attribute contains the Server nonce RAND_S
      parameter.  The RAND_S attribute MUST be present in
      EAP.Request/SAKE/Challenge.

|  AT_SERVERID (=5)

      The value field of this attribute contains the Server identifier
      (e.g., a non-null terminated string).  The AT_SERVERID attribute
      SHOULD be present in EAP.Request/SAKE Challenge.

   Type

|     EAP-SAKE=48

And the subsequent explanation headlines:

|  AT_RAND_P

|  AT_PEERID

|  AT_SPI_P

|  AT_MIC_P

should be amended to say, respectively:

|  AT_PEERID (=6)

|  AT_SPI_P (=8)

|  AT_MIC_P (=4)


(8)  Section 3.3.6 -- lack of specification, and artwork improvement

Finally, the explanation,

   AT_ENCR_DATA

      This attribute is optional to use in this message.  The encrypted
      data, if present, may contain an attribute AT_NEXT_TMPID,
      containing the NAI the Peer should use in the next EAP

                                ^
It should say:

|  IANA allocated a new EAP Type, 48, for EAP-SAKE.
                                ^^^^^^

(14)  Section 5.5 -- spelling and terminology

'Server' and 'Peer' are distinguished roles of EAP entities.
Therefore, when talking about both participants in an EAP session,
the term 'Peer' (in headline case) should not be used to avoid
confusion.

Therefore, the last paragraph of Section 5.5, on page 40,
that says,

     [...]  Thus, the recipient of an EAP message can be assured that
|  the message it just received is the one just sent by the other Peer
   and not a replay, since it contains a valid MIC of the recipient's
|  nonce and the other Peer nonce.  As before, the extent of replay
   protection is commensurate with the security of the KDF used to
   derive the MIC, the length and entropy of the shared secret used by
   the KDF, and the length of the MIC.

should better say:

     [...]  Thus, the recipient of an EAP message can be assured that
|  the message it just received is the one just sent by the other party
   and not a replay, since it contains a valid MIC of the recipient's
|  nonce and the other party's nonce.  As before, the extent of replay
   protection is commensurate with the security of the KDF used to
   derive the MIC, the length and entropy of the shared secret used by
   the KDF, and the length of the MIC.


(15)  Section 8.1 -- outdated Normative Reference

On page 45, the ref. [SHA1] should better point to the current
version, "FIPS 180-2 (with Change Notice)", February 2004.

Hello,
last weekend, I studied the recently published RFC 4795 (LLMNR)
authored by you.  Since I for last time had looked at a draft
version of that memo, roughly 20 months ago, some significant
changes have been introduced, and, unfortunately, I also find
some issues left in the published RFC.

As usual, the items below are presented in RFC textual order.
I use change bars ('|' in column 1) and occasionally
up/down pointing marker lines ('^^^'/'vvv') to emphasize
the location of textual issues and/or proposed corrections.
Modified text has been re-adjusted to match RFC formatting
rules, where appropriate.


(1)  Section 2.1.1 -- internal mis-ref. ?

On page 6, the explanation of the 'C' bit says:

             [...].  Responders MUST NOT respond to LLMNR queries with
|          the 'C' bit set, but may start the uniqueness verification
|          process, as described in Section 4.2.

This is a mix-up of the title of Section 4.1 and the section
number 4.2.
I strongly suspect that it was intended to refer to the procedures
outlined in the second half of Section 4.2 (paragraph 4 ff.).

If that's true, to avoid confusion, the RFC should better say,
rephrasing the title of Section 4.2 :

             [...].  Responders MUST NOT respond to LLMNR queries with
|          the 'C' bit set, but may start the conflict detection and
|          defense process, as described in Section 4.2.

Otherwise, the trailing "4.2." should be corrected to say "4.1."


(2)  under-specification for the non-UNIQUE case, clarification

Most parts of the RFC deal with the critical scenario of UNIQUE
names.  Nevertheless, the text in Section 4, at the bottom of
page 18, points out another important case, where LLMNR can
achieve much better service than DNS:

   By default, a responder SHOULD be configured to behave as though its
   name is UNIQUE on each interface on which LLMNR is enabled.  However,
|  it is also possible to configure multiple responders to be
|  authoritative for the same name.  For example, multiple responders
|  MAY respond to a query for an A or AAAA type record for a cluster
|  name (assigned to multiple hosts in the cluster).

When reading other parts of the RFC, I miss clear specifications
to handle this case.  (Please correct me if I have overlooked
something important.)

The issue is entangled with the question whether such cluster
member should be called "authoritative" for the non-UNIQUE name.
The definition of "Responder" in Section 1.2 clearly says 'yes',
but other places in the text apparently do not follow this
terminology.

In Section 2.1.1, the explanation of the 'T' bit (spanning from
the bottom of page 6 to the top of page 7) says:

|  T       Tentative.  The 'T'entative bit is set in a response if the
|          responder is authoritative for the name, but has not yet
|          verified the uniqueness of the name.  A responder MUST ignore
           the 'T' bit in a query, if set.  A response with the 'T' bit
<< page break >>
           set is silently discarded by the sender, except if it is a
|          uniqueness query, in which case, a conflict has been detected
|          and a responder MUST resolve the conflict as described in
           Section 4.1.

The major problem is in the first sentence:
According to 1.2, the responder is authoritative for the non-UNIQUE
name -- otherwise it would not be a responder for that name, making
the useful scenario with non-UNIQUE names impossible.
But because the name is non-UNIQUE, it will never be able to verify
the uniqueness of the name -- and in fact it should never try to do
so for names configured as non-UNIQUE (last bullet of 1.2).
Following this first sentence verbatim, any (authoritative) responder
for a non-UNIQUE name ought to set 'T' bit in the response, which,
in turn -- according to the third sentence quoted -- would cause the
sender to silently discard the response, again turning the scenario
un-usable.

This can not have been the intension of the specification.

I have tried to thoroughly cross-check other parts of the document,
and apparently, the proper solution (not causing harm otherwise)
would be to have the 'T' bit being cleared in responses for non-
UNIQUE names.  If that is correct, the above explanation should
be clarified by the addition of a statement to this end.

Yet, there's another issue with that snippit:  The last sentence
uses the term, "uniqueness query", which is not defined precisely
anywhere in the memo; the 4th paragraph of Section 2.7 uses the
similar term, "uniqueness verification query", which perhaps
should designate the same thing.
AFAICS, such a "uniqueness query" cannot be distinguished by a
responder from any other query, at the bits-on-the-wire level.
But that doesn't matter here, because the abuse of language,
"A response ... is ... discarded, except if it is a uniqueness query."
should be corrected anyway.  The text should perhaps better say:
"..., except if it is received in reply to a uniqueness query."
(The sender of that query indeed knows why it has been sent!)

Finally, when more than one query and response are being dealt
with, the term "responder" becomes ambiguous.  In Section 4.1
this might be acceptable (see below) because of the full context,
but here, the final "responder" might be very misleading
(apparently, that's the *sender* of the "uniqueness query").
I propose to rephrase the last half-sentence omitting the actor(s)
and let Section 4.1 give the details.

Taking altogether, the explanation of the 'T' bit should perhaps
be clarified to say:

   T       Tentative.  The 'T'entative bit is set in a response if the
|          responder is authoritative for a UNIQUE name, but has not yet
|          verified the uniqueness of the name, and it is cleared in all
|          other cases.  A responder MUST ignore the 'T' bit in a query,
           if set.  A response with the 'T' bit set is silently
|          discarded by the sender, except if it is received in reply to
|          a uniqueness query issued according to the rules in Section
|          4.1, in which case, a conflict has been detected and that
|          conflict MUST be resolved as described in Section 4.1.

I hope this modified version indeed says what was intended to say,
and that it clarifies all the points raised above.


(3)  Section 2.3 -- typo

For relaxation, that's an easy stuff:

In the second-to-last paragraph on page 10, Section 2.3 of RFC 4795
says:

                        [...].  The purpose of limiting the name
   authority scope of a responder is to prevent complications that could
|  be caused by coexistence of two or more hosts with the names
   representing child and parent (or grandparent) nodes in the DNS tree,
   for example, "foo.example.com." and "child.foo.example.com.".

It should say:

                        [...].  The purpose of limiting the name
   authority scope of a responder is to prevent complications that could
|  be caused by the coexistence of two or more hosts with the names
   representing child and parent (or grandparent) nodes in the DNS tree,
   for example, "foo.example.com." and "child.foo.example.com.".


(4)  Section 2.5 -- typos and mis-specification

(4a)
Within Section 2.5, the first paragraph on page 12 says:

   On receiving an LLMNR query, the responder MUST check whether it was
|  sent to an LLMNR multicast addresses defined in Section 2.  If it was
|  sent to another multicast address, then the query MUST be silently
|  discarded.

First of all, the first sentence should use "address" in place of
"addresses", or say "... to one of the LLMNR multicast addresses ...".

The much more serious issue is with the second sentence.
Following this sentence literally would prematurely disallow the
use of port 5355 as an ephemeral port for any other UDP unicast or
multicast application(s), which does not make sense, and which
IMHO is not necessary for proper operation of LLMNR.  (And systems
not implementing LLMNR would not follow this rule, anyway!)

To quote preceding text of the RFC:

- Section 2 says:

   LLMNR queries are sent to and received on port 5355.  The IPv4 link-
   scope multicast address a given responder listens to, and to which a
   sender sends queries, is 224.0.0.252.  The IPv6 link-scope multicast
   address a given responder listens to, and to which a sender sends all
   queries, is FF02:0:0:0:0:0:1:3.

- and Section 2.3, near the bottom of page 9, says:

   (a)  Responders MUST listen on UDP port 5355 on the link-scope
        multicast address(es) defined in Section 2, and on TCP port 5355
        on the unicast address(es) that could be set as the source
        address(es) when the responder responds to the LLMNR query.

An LLMNR Responder following this specifications, i.e. binding an
IPv4 datagram socket to {224.0.0.252,5355} and/or an IPv6 datagram
socket to {FF02::1:3,5355}, according to its IPv4/IPv6 support
(and interface-specific configuration), will never receive UPD
packets addressed to any other multicast addresses (or to any
other destination port), will never know if such a packet looks
like an LLMNR query, and does not need to discard such packets.

I propose to correct the first paragraph on page 12 (as quoted above)
to say:

   On receiving an LLMNR query, the responder MUST check whether it was
|  sent to one of the LLMNR multicast addresses defined in Section 2,
|  or via TCP.

(BTW, that's quite trivial, and perhaps does not even require
 RFC 2219 specification language.)

But if you prefer, an errata note could also ask for deletion of
the whole paragraph.


(4b)
In the third paragraph on page 12, for uniformity, the first sentence,

   For UDP queries and responses, the Hop Limit field in the IPv6 header
|  and the TTL field in the IPV4 header MAY be set to any value.
                              ^
should say:

   For UDP queries and responses, the Hop Limit field in the IPv6 header
|  and the TTL field in the IPv4 header MAY be set to any value.
                              ^

(5)  Section 3.1

This section contains probably much too 'optimistic' statements
on related work.

(5a)
The second paragraph says:

   Where DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 is implemented, DHCP options can be used to
   configure LLMNR on an interface.  The LLMNR Enable Option, described
   in [LLMNREnable], can be used to explicitly enable or disable use of
   LLMNR on an interface.  The LLMNR Enable Option does not determine
   whether, or in which order, DNS itself is used for name resolution.
   The order in which various name resolution mechanisms should be used
   can be specified using the Name Service Search Option (NSSO) for DHCP
   [RFC2937], using the LLMNR Enable Option code carried in the NSSO
   data.

AFAICS, [LLMNREnable] has never been finalized.
Section 8.2 apparently refers to <draft-guttman-dhc-mdns-enable-02>
-- which seems to have been a very popular reference.
Nevertheless, using common web search engines, I was not even able
to locate any online copy of the -02 version, only myriads of
references to it.
So perhaps this was just the 'tombstone' file for the expired -01
version (dated July 20, 2001), also available as the single matching
result from <http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-guttman-dhc-.*> !

Also, apparently a DHCP option number has never been assigned to
this draft by the IANA (IESG approval would have been required!).

Therefore, this option 'can' *not* be used, and an option number
for it cannot be plugged into the NSSO (DHCP Opt.#117) data.

Thus, the 'Science Fiction' (or better: 'Engineering Fiction' ?)
in the above quoted paragraph should perhaps better be aligned
with reality by changing all occurrences of "can" into "could".

(5b)
The fourth paragraph of Section 3.1 says:

                               [...].  Automatic IPv6 DNS configuration
   mechanisms (such as [RFC3315] and [DNSDisc]) are not yet widely
   deployed, and not all DNS servers support IPv6.  [...]

Apparently, [DNSDisc] refers to the long expired I-D,
<draft-ietf-ipv6-dns-discovery-07> .
Admittedly, some of the ideas of that draft have survived in the
IANA IPv6 (anycast) address registry and in other recent work in
progress, but -- independent of the "success history" of IPv6
deployment at large -- talking about "not yet widely deployed"
in this context seems to be an euphemism !


(6)  Section 4.1

(6a)
In support of the enhancements discussed in item (2) above,
I propose to clarify the first paragraph of Section 4.1,

   Prior to sending an LLMNR response with the 'T' bit clear, a
   responder configured with a UNIQUE name MUST verify that there is no
   other host within the scope of LLMNR query propagation that is
   authoritative for the same name on that interface.

by adding another sentence, to say:

   Prior to sending an LLMNR response with the 'T' bit clear, a
   responder configured with a UNIQUE name MUST verify that there is no
   other host within the scope of LLMNR query propagation that is
|  authoritative for the same name on that interface.  Responses for
|  non-unique names are always sent with the 'T' bit clear.

[ Again, I hope that's what is intended. ]

(6b)
The use of the term, "responder", reaches its limitations in
this section; in particular, the first paragraph on page 20
is very hard to understand: there, the responder *reveives*
the response (sic!).  I had to read the whole Section again
until it became clear that that was not in error!

Section 1.2 already makes the roles of "responder" and
"authoritative [server]" synonymous.

Future derived work should perhaps reconsider the use of terms.
The conventional terms 'client' and 'server' for the roles of
the LLMNR entities would have avoided these terminological
idiosyncrasies.  (It is not unusual for other protocols
as well to have the same entity performing both roles --
for instance, a DNS recursive resolver!)


(7)  Section 4.2

The second paragraph has interspersed an inadvertant blank line.


(8)  Section 6  -- incomplete

For the benefit of the reader, the IANA Considerations section,
in the RFC published version, usually contains a summary of the
assignments performed by the IANA on behalf of the document.

Therefore, the following note should be added to Section 6
of RFC 4795:

   IANA has allocated to LLMNR:
   - server port 5355 for both TCP and UDP;
   - the link-scope IPv4 multicast address 224.0.0.252 ;
   - the link-scope IPv6 multicast address FF02::1:3 .

[ or similar ]


This concludes my notes on RFC 4795.
Once again, I apologize for not having found the time to perform
a detailed review before publication.

Please comment (it doesn't hurry!).

Many of the items above seem to be appropriate for an RFC Errata
Note; but I leave it to your decision whether this should be done,
possibly to promote interoperable implementations of the proposal,
or if you prefer to just make notice of these comments, for
consideration in possible future derived work.

Preferrably, you should submit an Author's Errata Note to the
RFC Editor's RFC Errata web pages, making freely use of the
material supplied above.  But if you like, I can formally
submit an Errata Note on my own, with your consent.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
after studying the recently published RFC 4721 authored by you,
"Mobile IPv4 Challenge/Response Extensions (Revised)",
I would like to submit a few comments, drawing your attention
to some textual flaws left over in the text.
These might not be worth of an RFC Errata Note, but you should
at least make note thereof, for consideration in any future work
derived from this specification.


(1)  Ruler line misalignment

In Section 2, on page 4, the two ruler lines on top of Figure 1
are misaligned; they should be indented one more column.

The same issue holds for Figure 2 in Section 4, on page 11,
and for Figure 3 in Section 5, on page 12.


(2)  missing article

In the first paragraph of Section 3.1, on page 5,
    "... specified in Mobile IP specification ..."
should better say:
    "... specified in the Mobile IP specification ..." .
                     ^^^^^

(3)  Inconsistent/incomplete change of terminology

RFC 4721 has changed the terms used to specify various protocol
elements.  Yet these changes have not been performed consistently
throughout the memo.

I have observed the following places where updates have been omitted:

- Section 3.1, page 6, 4th paragraph:
   "(MN-AAA)"  should say:  "(Mobile-AAA)"

- Section 3.5, page 11, 3rd paragraph:
   "MN-AAA"  should say:  "Mobile-AAA"

- Section 11, last paragraph on page 16:
   "MN-AAA"  should say:  "Mobile-AAA"

- Section 11, first paragraph on page 17:
   "Mobile Node - Foreign Agent (MN-FA)"  should say:  "Mobile-Foreign"

- Appendix B, first line on page 22:

     BAD_AUTHENTICATION
  should say:
     'mobile node failed authentication'

- Appendix E, on page 24:

     send_error(STALE_CHALLENGE)
  should say:
     send_error(stale_challenge)

  and

     send_error(UNKNOWN_CHALLENGE);
  should say:
     send_error(unknown_challenge);

Also, Appendix D makes repeated use of "MN-FA Authentication",
but that is not so closely related to the extension now named
differently, and thus can perhaps be left unchanged.


(4)  Section 11 -- logical grouping

In Section 11, the (new) final paragraph is an adjunct to the fourth
indented paragraph (second paragraph on page 17) and should better
have been unified with that one; the new codes are already covered
by the wording there!


(5)  Appendix A -- typo

In the 7th bullet (onpage 20), "compare to" should say: "compared to" .


Kind regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Greetings,

I note that an erratum for RFC 4181 has been posted on the RFC 
Editor's web site and I thank you for that.  It should be noted, 
however, that it does not contain the following two typographical 
errors that were reported by Alfred Hoenes and previously confirmed 
by me as being legitimate errors:

It would be appreciated if you could add these to the erratum when
time and workload permits.

Kind regards,

Some errata for RFC 4795 have been submitted by Alfred Hoenes. 

Section 2.1.1:

"as described in Section 4.2" should read "as described in Section 4.1". 

The description of the Tentative bit should read as follows:

   T       Tentative.  The 'T'entative bit is set in a response if the
           responder is authoritative for a UNIQUE name, but has not yet
           verified the uniqueness of the name, and it is cleared in all
           other cases.  A responder MUST ignore the 'T' bit in a query,
           if set.  A response with the 'T' bit set is silently
           discarded by the sender, except if it is received in reply to
           a uniqueness query issued according to the rules in Section
           4.1, in which case, a conflict has been detected and that
           conflict MUST be resolved as described in Section 4.1.

Section 2.3

"could be caused by coexistence" should read "could be caused by the 
coexistence"

Section 2.5

"sent to an LLMNR multicast addresses defined in Section 2" should
read "sent to one of the LLMNR multicast addresses defined in
Section 2". 

"TTL field in the IPV4 header MAY be set" should read "TTL in the IPv4 
header MAY be set"

Section 4.1

The first paragraph should include an additional sentence:
"Responses for non-UNIQUE names are always sent with the 'T' bit clear."

Section 4.2

The second paragraph has an interspersed blank line inserted.

Hello.

Thanks for the thorough read and comments.

I think that the first flaw is quite serious and definitely needs the  
errata note.
The spelling/typos I'm not so sure make that much of a difference for  
anyone
reading them and would prefer that they not be used.  How strongly do  
you
feel that they should be included?

Stéphane,

Yes, FF00-FE0F should be FE00-FE0F (as reflected by "VARIATION  
SELECTORs").

RFC-Editor,

Please post this as RFC 4518 errata.  FF00-FE0F should be FE00-FE0F.

Thanks, Kurt

I sadly have to report a typo that I now have found in the
RFC Errata Note material I originally had supplied for RFC 4695
in December.  Unfortunately, nobody had caught that flaw then.

The following lines in the modified ABNF (Appendix D of RFC 4695):

   P        = %x51
   Q        = %x52

in fact should say:

   P        = %x50
   Q        = %x51

Rationale:  ASCII, `man ascii` on any UNIX system, RFC 20, et al.
(There must have been some EBCDIC spirit pouring into the ASCII world.)
            

Please check again, and finally correct the RFC 4695 Errata Note.
I apologize for any inconvenience.

I also just have notified the authors, asking them to apply this
correction to  draft-ietf-avt-rfc4695-bis  as well.

Kind regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hi,

<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4234#section-2.4> says:

    External representations of terminal value characters will vary
    according to constraints in the storage or transmission environment.
    Hence, the same ABNF-based grammar may have multiple external
    encodings, such as one for a 7-bit US-ASCII environment, another for
    a binary octet environment, and still a different one when 16-bit
    Unicode is used.  Encoding details are beyond the scope of ABNF,
    although Appendix A (Core) provides definitions for a 7-bit US-ASCII
    environment as has been common to much of the Internet.

Substitute "Appendix A" by "Appendix B" here.

Best regards, Julian

In section 4.2.1.1. (Pre-Publish Key Rollover) of 4641, the table
detailing the stages of the rollover process appears to be missing some
indentation.

Existing Text:

   Pre-publish key rollover involves four stages as follows:

      ----------------------------------------------------------------
      initial         new DNSKEY       new RRSIGs      DNSKEY removal
      ----------------------------------------------------------------
      SOA0            SOA1             SOA2            SOA3
      RRSIG10(SOA0)   RRSIG10(SOA1)    RRSIG11(SOA2)   RRSIG11(SOA3)

      DNSKEY1         DNSKEY1          DNSKEY1         DNSKEY1
      DNSKEY10        DNSKEY10         DNSKEY10        DNSKEY11
      DNSKEY11         DNSKEY11
      RRSIG1 (DNSKEY) RRSIG1 (DNSKEY)  RRSIG1(DNSKEY)  RRSIG1 (DNSKEY)
      RRSIG10(DNSKEY) RRSIG10(DNSKEY)  RRSIG11(DNSKEY) RRSIG11(DNSKEY)
      ----------------------------------------------------------------

                         Pre-Publish Key Rollover

   initial: Initial version of the zone: DNSKEY 1 is the Key Signing
      Key.  DNSKEY 10 is used to sign all the data of the zone, the Zone
      Signing Key.

   new DNSKEY: DNSKEY 11 is introduced into the key set.  Note that no
      signatures are generated with this key yet, but this does not
      secure against brute force attacks on the public key.  The minimum
      duration of this pre-roll phase is the time it takes for the data
      to propagate to the authoritative servers plus TTL value of the
      key set.


Corrected table, with '|' indicating a changed line:

   Pre-publish key rollover involves four stages as follows:

Hi,
title of RFC4449 is: "Securing Mobile IPv6 Route Optimization Using a  
Static Shared Key"
however, the pages title is: "RFC 4449           Shared Data for  
Precomputable Kbm           June 2006"

well, they differ sufficiently enough that a reader think that he is  
not reading the right document!

Regards, Marc.

Hello RFC Editor,

We have some errata for RFC 4342 that we would like included in the RFC errata 
page.  Please see the attached.

Thanks very much,
Eddie Kohler

RFC 4342, "Profile for Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP)
Congestion Control ID 3: TCP-Friendly Rate Control (TFRC)"

Reported By: Eddie Kohler and Sally Floyd, from Gerrit Renker and
	Arjuna Sathiaseelan 
Date: February 7, 2007

Section 5, 6th paragraph:
Explanation: Clarification of initial sending rates

It states:
   Translating this to the packet-based congestion control of CCID 3,
   the initial CCID 3 sending rate is allowed to be at least two packets
   per RTT, and at most four packets per RTT, depending on the packet
   size.  The initial rate is only allowed to be three or four packets
   per RTT when, in terms of segment size, that translates to at most
   4380 bytes per RTT.

It should say:
   Therefore, in contrast to [RFC3448], the initial CCID 3 sending rate
   is allowed to be at least two packets per RTT, and at most four
   packets per RTT, depending on the packet size.  The initial rate is
   only allowed to be three or four packets per RTT when, in terms of
   segment size, that translates to at most 4380 bytes per RTT.  This
   might be implemented, for example, by setting the initial sending
   rate to min(4*s, max(2*s, 4380 bytes)), where "s" as usual is the
   packet size in bytes.

Section 5, 7th paragraph:
Explanation: Clarification of round-trip time measurement

It states:
   The sender's measurement of the round-trip time uses the Elapsed Time
   and/or Timestamp Echo option contained in feedback packets, as
   described in Section 8.2. The Elapsed Time option is required, while
   the Timestamp Echo option is not.  The sender maintains an average
   round-trip time heavily weighted on the most recent measurements.

It should say:
   The sender's measurement of the round-trip time uses DCCP's mechanisms
   for round-trip time measurement.  This includes Elapsed Time and/or
   Timestamp Echo options.  As described in Section 8.2, feedback packets
   must carry an Elapsed Time option; Timestamp Echo is optional.
   The sender maintains an average round-trip time heavily weighted on the
   most recent measurements.  Senders MAY use any available round-trip time
   measurements, including from the initial Request-Response packet exchange,
   to maintain this average.  This differs from [RFC 3448], which constrains
   round-trip time measurements to feedback packets only.

Hello,
after studying the recently published RFC 4778 (OPSEC Practices)
authored by you, I would like to submit a few comments, pointing
out some issues I found with the RFC text, and supplying material
for an appropriate RFC Errata Note.

I first explain the single more serious flaw I found; the items
covering minor flaws (typos and grammar issues) are presented
subsequently in RFC textual order.

I use change bars ('|' in column 1) and occasionally
up/down pointing marker lines ('^^^'/'vvv') to emphasize
the location of textual issues and/or proposed corrections.
Modified text has been re-adjusted to match RFC formatting
rules, where appropriate.


(1)  Section 2.2.3 -- wrong acronym expansion

The second paragraph of Section 2.2.4, on page 15, says:

   SSH may not be supported on legacy equipment.  In some cases,
   changing the host name of a device requires an SSH rekey event since
|  the key is based on some combination of host name, Message
|  Authentication Code (MAC) address, and time.  [...]

It should say:

   SSH may not be supported on legacy equipment.  In some cases,
   changing the host name of a device requires an SSH rekey event since
|  the key is based on some combination of host name, Media Access
|  Control (MAC) address, and time.  [...]

(Or perhaps simply, and more generally, use "link layer address"
 in place of "Media Access Control (MAC) address".)


(2)  Section 2.1.2 -- typo

The final paragraph of Section 2.1.2, on page 9, says:

|  How ISPs manage these logins vary greatly, although many of the
   larger ISPs employ some sort of AAA mechanism to help automate
   privilege-level authorization and utilize the automation to bypass
   the need for a second authentication step.  [...]

It should say:
                                   vvv
|  How ISPs manage these logins varies greatly, although many of the
   larger ISPs employ some sort of AAA mechanism to help automate
   privilege-level authorization and utilize the automation to bypass
   the need for a second authentication step.  [...]


(3)  Section 2.2 -- typo

The first paragraph of Section 2.2, on page 10, says:

                         [...].  Note that while many of the security
   concerns and practices are the same for OOB management and in-band
   management, most ISPs prefer an OOB management system, since access
|  to the devices that make up this management network are more
   vigilantly protected and considered to be less susceptible to
   malicious activity.

It should say:

                         [...].  Note that while many of the security
   concerns and practices are the same for OOB management and in-band
   management, most ISPs prefer an OOB management system, since access
|  to the devices that make up this management network is more
   vigilantly protected and considered to be less susceptible to
   malicious activity.


(4)  Section 2.2.2 -- typo, and mis-wording

(4a)
Within Section 2.2.2, the 4th paragraph on page 13 says:

It should say:

                                             [...].  Most large ISPs

(4b)
The next (5th) paragraph on page 13 says:

   Access control is strictly enforced for infrastructure devices by
|  using stringent filtering rules.  A limited set of IP addresses are
   allowed to initiate connections to the infrastructure devices and are
|  specific to the services to which they are to limited (i.e., SSH and
   SNMP).
                                             ^^^^
I suspect that it was intended to say:

   Access control is strictly enforced for infrastructure devices by
|  using stringent filtering rules.  A limited set of IP addresses is
|  allowed to initiate connections to the infrastructure devices, and
|  these addresses are specifically limited to the respective services
|  (i.e., SSH and SNMP).

(or use similar wording).


(5)  Section 2.2.3 -- word twister

In Section 2.2.3, on page 15, the 3rd bullet says:

   o  Data Origin Authentication - Management traffic is strictly
      filtered to allow only specific IP addresses to have access to the
|     infrastructure devices.  This does not alleviate risk the from
      spoofed traffic, although when combined with edge filtering using
      BCP38 [RFC2827] and BCP84 [RFC3704] guidelines (discussed in
      Section 2.5), then the risk of spoofing is mitigated, barring a
      compromised internal system.  [...]

It should say:

   o  Data Origin Authentication - Management traffic is strictly
      filtered to allow only specific IP addresses to have access to the
|     infrastructure devices.  This does not alleviate the risk from
      spoofed traffic, although when combined with edge filtering using

      compromised internal system.  [...]


(6)  Section 2.3 -- typo

The 1st sentence of Section 2.3, on top of page 16, says:

   This section refers to how traffic is handled that traverses the
|  network infrastructure device.  [...]

It should say:

   This section refers to how traffic is handled that traverses the
|  network infrastructure devices.  [...]
                                ^

(7)  Section 2.3.4 -- typo

The last paragraph of Section 2.3.4, on page 18, says:

                                        [...].  One such example is at
|  edge boxes, where up to 1000 T1s connecting into a router with an

   (Optical Carrier) uplink.  [...]


(8)  Section 2.5.2 -- typos

(8a)
The first paragraph of Section 2.5.2, on page 24, says:

   Images and configurations are stored on specific hosts that have
   limited access.  All access and activity relating to these hosts are
|  authenticated and logged via AAA services.  When uploaded/downloading
   any system software or configuration files, either TFTP, FTP, or SCP
   can be used.  Where possible, SCP is used to secure the data transfer
   and FTP is generally never used.  All SCP access is username/password
   authenticated but since this requires an interactive shell, most ISPs
   will use shared key authentication to avoid the interactive shell.
   While TFTP access does not have any security measures, it is still
   widely used, especially in OOB management scenarios.  Some ISPs
|  implement IP-based restriction on the TFTP server, while some custom
   written TFTP servers will support MAC-based authentication.  The
   MAC-based authentication is more common when using TFTP to bootstrap
   routers remotely.

|  In at least one environment these, tools are Kerberized to take

   advantage of automated authentication (not confidentiality).

(9)  Appendix A.2 -- typo

The second bullet in Appendix A.2, on page 34, says:
                             vvvvvvvvvv
|  o  IP Source Route Option can allows attackers to establish stealth
      TCP connections.

It should say:

      TCP connections.


Please comment.

I suggest that at least item (1) above be addressed by an
RFC Errata Note, and I leave it to your decision whether to
also include the corrections to the other flaws.

Preferrably, you should submit an Author's Errata Note to the
RFC Editor's RFC Errata web pages, making freely use of the
material supplied above.  But if you like, I can formally
submit an Errata Note on my own, with your consent.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Dear RFC Editors,

I would like to submit as RFC errata the following corrections for both
RFC2661 and RFC3931.

In "Appendix A: Control Channel Slow Start and Congestion Avoidance" of
RFC2661 and RFC3931, three references to SSTHRESH are misspelled as
SSHTRESH. For example, the second reference below should read SSTHRESH
instead of SSHTRESH.

Appendix A: Control Channel Slow Start and Congestion Avoidance
   ...
   increase will be limited by the Receive Window Size). The variable
   SSTHRESH determines when the sender switches from slow start to
   congestion avoidance.  Slow start is used while CWND is less than
   SSHTRESH.

Regards,
- Ming

Errata for RFC 2426

Section 4 (p. 32) says

 ;For name=3D"AGENT"
   param        =3D agent-inline-param

   param        =3D/ agent-refer-param

   value        =3D agent-inline-value
        ; Value and parameter MUST match

   value        =3D/ agent-refer-value
        ; Value and parameter MUST match

   agent-inline-param =3D ""
        ; No parameters allowed

   agent-refer-param =3D "VALUE" "=3D" "uri"
        ; Only value parameter allowed

   agent-inline-value =3D text-value
        ; Value MUST be a valid vCard object

   agent-refer-value =3D uri
        ; URI MUST refer to image content of given type

It should say:

 ;For name=3D"AGENT"
   param        =3D agent-inline-param

   param        =3D/ agent-refer-param

   value        =3D agent-inline-value
        ; Value and parameter MUST match

   value        =3D/ agent-refer-value
        ; Value and parameter MUST match

   agent-inline-param =3D ""
        ; No parameters allowed

   agent-refer-param =3D "VALUE" "=3D" "uri"

   agent-inline-value =3D text-value
        ; Value MUST be a valid vCard object

   agent-refer-value =3D uri
        ; URI MUST refer a valid vCard object

Rationale:=20
- Presumably, the comment from img-refer-value was copied, but it was =
not modified.
- The correction is consistent with comment for agent-inline-value.
- The purpose of AGENT type is "To specify information about another =
person who will act on behalf of the individual or resource associated =
with the vCard." (Section 3.5.4)

Roberto Javier Godoy

--------------------------------
Section 4 (p. 29) says:

   ;For name=3D"SOURCE"
   param        =3D source-param
        ; No parameters allowed

   value        =3D uri

   source-param =3D ("VALUE" "=3D" "uri")
                / ("CONTEXT" "=3D" "word")
        ; Parameter value specifies the protocol context
        ; for the uri value.
                / (x-name "=3D" *SAFE-CHAR)


It should say:

   ;For name=3D"SOURCE"
   param        =3D source-param
        ; Only source parameters allowed

   value        =3D uri

   source-param =3D ("VALUE" "=3D" "uri")
                / ("CONTEXT" "=3D" "word")
        ; Parameter value specifies the protocol context
        ; for the uri value.
                / (x-name "=3D" *SAFE-CHAR)

--------------------------------

Section 4 (p. 32) says

 ;For name=3D"AGENT"
   param        =3D agent-inline-param

   param        =3D/ agent-refer-param

   value        =3D agent-inline-value
        ; Value and parameter MUST match

   value        =3D/ agent-refer-value
        ; Value and parameter MUST match

   agent-inline-param =3D ""
        ; No parameters allowed

   agent-refer-param =3D "VALUE" "=3D" "uri"
        ; Only value parameter allowed

   agent-inline-value =3D text-value
        ; Value MUST be a valid vCard object

   agent-refer-value =3D uri
        ; URI MUST refer to image content of given type

It should say:

 ;For name=3D"AGENT"
   param        =3D agent-inline-param

   param        =3D/ agent-refer-param

   param        =3D/ text-param

   value        =3D agent-inline-value
        ; Value and parameter MUST match

   value        =3D/ agent-refer-value
        ; Value and parameter MUST match

   value        =3D/ text-value
        ; Value and parameter MUST match

   agent-inline-param =3D ""
        ; No parameters allowed

   agent-refer-param =3D "VALUE" "=3D" "uri"
        ; Only value parameter allowed

   agent-inline-value =3D text-value
        ; Value MUST be a valid vCard object

   agent-refer-value =3D uri
        ; URI MUST refer a valid vCard object

Rationales:=20
1 (text-param, text-value)
 - "Type value: The default is a single vcard value. It can also be =
reset to either a single text or uri value." (Section 3.5.4)
 - The "single text" part was forgotten in the ABNF.
2 (URI MUST refer a valid vCard object)
- Presumably, the comment from img-refer-value was copied, but it was =
not modified.
- The correction is consistent with comment for agent-inline-value.
- The purpose of AGENT type is "To specify information about another =
person who will act on behalf of the individual or resource associated =
with the vCard." (Section 3.5.4)

--------------------------------

Section 4 (p. 34) says:

 ;For name=3D"UID"
   param        =3D ""
        ; No parameters allowed

   value        =3D text-value

It should say

 ;For name=3D"UID"
   param        =3D "TYPE" "=3D" (iana-token / x-name)
        ; No parameters allowed

   value        =3D text-value

Rationale: Section 3.6.7 (p. 23) "UID Type Definition" says=20

<<The type can include the type parameter "TYPE" to specify the format
   of the identifier. The TYPE parameter value should be an IANA
   registered identifier format. The value can also be a non-standard
   format.>>

--------------------------------

Section 4 (p. 35) says:

   adr-type     =3D "dom" / "intl" / "postal" / "parcel" / "home"
                / "work" / "pref" / iana-type / x-name

It should say

   adr-type     =3D "dom" / "intl" / "postal" / "parcel" / "home"
                / "work" / "pref" / iana-token / x-name

Rationale:=20
   iana-type is not defined in given ABNF, but iana-token is. This is =
the only reference to iana-type in the document, so it is likely to be a =
typo.

   iana-token   =3D 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / "-")
        ; vCard type or parameter identifier registered with IANA

--------------------------------

Section 7 (p. 38) says:

Rationale:

VERSION types." (Section 1) N was missing in the original information.

Hello,

Peter Su <hcsu@zyxel.com.tw> brought up the following issues in our RFC 
3964 that should be added to errata:

In Section 4.1.3:
OLD:
    src_v6 = 2002:1234:1234::1 (forged address of the target 6to4 node)
    dst_v6 = 2002:0900:0002::1 (valid address)
    src_v4 = 8.0.0.1           (valid or invalid address)
    dst_v4 = 9.0.0.2           (valid address, matches dst_v6)
NEW:
    src_v6 = 2002:1234:1234::1 (forged address of the target 6to4 node)
    dst_v6 = 2001:db8::1       (valid address)
    src_v4 = 8.0.0.1           (valid or invalid address)

Reason: copy/paste error.  Traffic is sent to the native IPv6 node, so the 
destination address should be non-2002::/16.  When 6to4 is not used, 
dst_v4 is not applicable so it could be removed.


In Section 4.2.5:

OLD:
    The policy control is usually enacted by applying restrictions to
    where the routing information for 2002::/16 and/or 192.188.99.0/24
    (if the anycast address used [3]) will spread.

NEW:
    The policy control is usually enacted by applying restrictions to
    where the routing information for 2002::/16 and/or 192.88.99.0/24
    (if the anycast address used [3]) will spread.

Reason: typo in the anycast address.

Hi,

RFC4742 ("Using the NETCONF Configuration Protocol over Secure SHell
(SSH)") keeps referring throughout to the NETCONF specification as RFC4721,
even though NETCONF is really specified in RFC4741 ("NETCONF Configuration
Protocol"). This seems like a clear editorial flaw.

RFC 3958 contains:

but the ALPHANUM production is missing from the grammar (and is not in
RFC 4234 either).

Confirmed by the author.

Hello,
after studying the recently published RFC 4820 (SCTP Padding
extensions) authored by you, I would like to pointing out a
serious inconsistency I found in the RFC text.

The first paragraph of Section 3 says:

   This chunk is used to pad an SCTP packet.  A PAD chunk can be used to
|  enlarge the packet by 4 to 65536 bytes in steps of 4 bytes.  An SCTP
   packet MAY contain multiple PAD chunks.
                                  ^
and the text below Figure 1 explains:

   Length: 2 bytes (unsigned integer)
      This value holds the length of the Padding Data plus 4.

Because a 2-byte unsigned integer can accept valiues ranging
from 0 to 65535 and it can be inferred from the above text that
`Length` should be divisible by 4, the maximum value possible
for `Length`, and hence the maximum padding size is  65532  !
                                                         ^
(In the spirit of the SCTP specification, I do not recommend to
 change the definition of `Length` allowing 0 to encode 65536.)

I strongly recommend to post an RFC Errata note correcting the
above paragraph to say:

   This chunk is used to pad an SCTP packet.  A PAD chunk can be used to
|  enlarge the packet by 4 to 65532 bytes in steps of 4 bytes.  An SCTP
   packet MAY contain multiple PAD chunks.
                                  ^

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
after studying the recently published RFC 4824 (IP-SFS)
authored by you, I would like to submit a few comments,
pointing out some issues I found with the RFC text.

The items below are presented in RFC textual order.
I use change bars ('|' in column 1) and occasionally
up/down pointing marker lines ('^^^'/'vvv') to emphasize
the location of textual issues and/or proposed corrections.


(1)  Section 4.3

There's a word omission in the final paragraph of Section 4.3 :

                                v
|    [...].  If the link partner ready to receive, it returns an RTR
   signal.

should better say:

                                vvvv
|    [...].  If the link partner is ready to receive, it returns an RTR
   signal.


(2)  Section 5

RFC 4824 completely fails to appropriatey point out the benefits and
merits of IP-SFS, and to perform a fair comparison with industry
standard strenght security for common wireless protocols.

Apparently, IP-SFS provides for industry standard Wireless Equivalent
Privacy (WEP).  It *is* a wireless protocol!  Its interfaces do not
consume electrical power (if used under daylight conditions) and do not
produce any electromagnetical interference.  The former property
results in great applicability to developing economies that lack
substantial ubiquitous electrical power distribution but have a lot of
cheap manpower available, but it also makes IP-SFS great for countries
with instable electrical power distribution systems, like the U.S.
(and, yet currently still to a lesser degree, Europe).  Both properties
together make IP-SFS strictly immune to any modern cryptanalytical
methods based on the variation of power consumption over time and to
the suspected industry espionage by the electronical 'sky ears' still
deployed in Europe and otherwise mostly idle, since the end of the Cold
War.

Furthermore, IP-SFS apparently is very well suited for environments
with stringent legal requirements for the war against the Axis of
Evil, with its step-by-step increasing legal custody of privacy and
political correctness of content to be performed / enforced by
legal authorities and cooperating access and content providers.

That should make IP-SFS particularly interesting for the emerging
infrastructure of the .cn domain (and for many other countries,
as well).

To change the disadvantageous presentation of IP-SFS and to address
at least a few of its benefits, I recommend to change, via an RFC
Errata Note, the first paragraph of Section 5,

|  By its nature of line-of-sight signaling, IP-SFS is considered
|  insecure.  The transmission of sensitive data over IP-SFS is strongly
|  discouraged unless security is provided by higher level protocols.

to say:

|  By its nature of line-of-sight signaling, IP-SFS is considered to
|  provide industry strength wireless equivalent security and privacy
|  (WEP).  The transmission of sensitive data over IP-SFS is strongly
|  discouraged unless security is provided by legal environments or
|  corporate guidelines of conduct, impending punishment of the
|  interfaces, or other higher level protocols.


:-)

Please comment.

Preferrably, you should submit an Author's Errata Note to the
RFC Editor's RFC Errata web pages, making freely use of the
material supplied above.  But if you like, I can formally
submit an Errata Note on my own, with your consent.


(Authors:
 The last person acknowledged in Section 6 of RFC 4824 might provide
 you with further context on this note and its origin, if needed.)


Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Clarification regarding the receive window (reported by Michael Scharf):

Section 4.3 of RFC 4782, second paragraph says:

   "The QS Nonce in the
   Response is set to the received value of the QS Nonce in the Quick-
   Start Option."

It should say:

   "The QS Nonce in the
   Response is set to the received value of the QS Nonce in the Quick-
   Start Option.

   "If the TCP host has sufficient receive buffer space, it could
   estimate the required buffer space as the product of the approved
   Quick-Start rate and the round-trip time, and advertise a receive
   window based on this required buffer space.  This receive window
   should allow the other TCP host to fully use the approved Quick-Start
   Request.

   If the TCP host doesn't know the round-trip time, the TCP host
   could use an estimate of the round-trip time in calculating the
   required buffer space.  Alternately, the TCP host could base the
   advertised receive window on the available buffer space, without
   calculating the buffer space required for the other TCP host to
   fully use the approved Quick-Start Request.

   If the Quick-Start Response is sent in a SYN/ACK packet, then
   window scaling of the receive window is not allowed [RFC1323];
   if necessary, the TCP host could send a scaled receive window
   in a separate ACK packet following the SYN/ACK packet."


Clarification regarding the receive window (reported by Michael Scharf):

Section 4.4 of RFC 4782, fourth paragraph, says:

   "The TCP host SHOULD set its congestion window cwnd to QS-cwnd only if
   QS-cwnd is greater than cwnd; otherwise, QS-cwnd is ignored."

It should say:

   "The TCP host SHOULD set its congestion window cwnd to QS-cwnd
   only if QS-cwnd is greater than cwnd; otherwise, QS-cwnd is
   ignored.  In either case, the sender can transmit up to the
   minimum of the cwnd and the receiver's advertised window rwnd,
   as specified in [RFC2581]."

Hello,
after studying the recently published RFC 3659 (FTP Ext'ns)
authored by you, I would like to send you a few comments.

First of all, thanks for eventually completing this effort!
Apparently this document has suffered a record-breaking delay
in the publication process.
Perhaps, there are hidden reasons (that should not be made public
and that I do not really need to know) that have lead to the final
change in the author list, dropping R. Elz from it.
I just have observed that I have not received any more responses on
messages sent to R. Elz (related to this topic), since several years.

My personal entry into the IETF 'business' has been closely related
with that project:

Back in 2001, we were running into trouble with interoperability
problems using HP's FTP implementations under various operating
systems; the hotline finally arrived at arranging a contact with
the HP Labs, where Rick Adams in turn redirected me to Robert Elz,
which then pointed me to the then current ftpext-mlst draft for
documentation that was missing from HP's man pages, where, instead
of giving details, pointers to an "upcoming RFC" had been placed.

It must have been near the end of 2001 when I then performed my
first detailed I-D review ever, on that draft, sending a long
list of editorial enhancement proposals to Robert Elz.

Many of these issues have been addressed; but, unfortunately,
reading the published RFC I find a few textual flaws left in
the text, or newly introduced since 2001.
These are listed below.

Related deficiencies with the IANA registry per Section 10 of
RFC 3659 have just been reported in a separate message to the
IANA that has been copied to you, Paul.  I expect they will be
contacting you for cross-checking.


(1)  Typo

In Section 6.5 of RFC 3659, on mid-page 22, there is a typo;
"sever" apparently should be "server".
Thus the paragraph,
                                                               vvvvv
|  That those pathnames all exist does not imply that the TVFS sever
   will necessarily grant any kind of access rights to the named paths,
   or that access to the same file via different pathnames will
   necessarily be granted equal rights.

should in fact say:
                                                               vvvvvv
|  That those pathnames all exist does not imply that the TVFS server
   will necessarily grant any kind of access rights to the named paths,
   or that access to the same file via different pathnames will
   necessarily be granted equal rights.


(2)  Typo

The final paragraph of Section 7, on page 23, says:

   The MLST and MLSD commands also extend the FTP protocol as presented
|  in STD 9, RFC 959 [3] and STD 3, RFC 1123 [9] to allow that
   transmission of 8-bit data over the control connection.  [...]
                                                          ^^^^
It should perhaps better say:

   The MLST and MLSD commands also extend the FTP protocol as presented
|  in STD 9, RFC 959 [3] and STD 3, RFC 1123 [9] to allow the
   transmission of 8-bit data over the control connection.  [...]
                                                          ^^^

(3)  Improper specification?

The first paragraph of Section 7.5.4, on page 33, says:

   The create fact indicates when a file, or directory, was first
   created.  Exactly what "creation" is for this purpose is not
|  specified here, and may vary from server to server.  About all that
|  can be said about the value returned is that it can never indicate a
|  later time than the modify fact.

IMHO, the last sentence is inappropriate and should better have been
deleted.

Rationale:

It is one of the benefits of 'Create' timestamps for directory
entries that there is *no* enforced relationship between that
timestamp and the 'Modify' timestamp related to the file *content*.

We still support legacy systems from Hewlett-Packard that indeed
maintain three timestamps per directory entry: 'Create', 'Modify',
and 'Access'.  The very useful behaviour of the File System and
the proprietary Networking Services is as follows: If you move a
file to another directory or copy it (within a system, or across
the network), the 'Modify' timestamp does not change (since the
file content is unchanged from what it was then), only the 'Create'
timestamp of the new directory entry is set to the current time.
(This means the 'Modify' timestamp behaves like a 'last update'
timestamp embedded in the file content, e.g., in a PDF file.)
In this case, the create fact would have to be *later* than the
modify fact, for RFC 3659.  Naturally, if a file was being edited,
the 'Modify' timestamp changes and will then be later than the
'Create' timestamp.
The natural behaviour of a hypothetical FTP client implementing
RFC 3659 in such environment, when performing a 'get' operation,
would be to obtain the modify timestamp of the remote file via
MLSx or MDTM and, after performing the RETR (and, perhaps verifying
the 'atomicity' of the transfer via another MDTM that should deliver
the same response again) setting the 'Modify' timestamp of the local
copy of the file to the moment corresponding to the MDTM result
value (or the modify fact value from the MLSx).


(4)  Typo (punctuation)

In the 5th line of the text in Section 7.7.3, on page 39,

     "... relative to the servers current directory ..."

should better say:

     "... relative to the server's current directory ..."


(5)  Typo (word replication)

The text at the end of Section 7.7.11, on mid-page 49, says:

                                                           [...]  Note
   also that this server does not show a "pdir" entry when listing the
|  contents of the root directory of the virtual filestore; however, it
|  does however include multiple "cdir" and "pdir" entries when it feels
   inclined.  [...]

It should perhaps avoid the repeated "however" and say:

                                                           [...]  Note
   also that this server does not show a "pdir" entry when listing the
   contents of the root directory of the virtual filestore; however, it
|  does include multiple "cdir" and "pdir" entries when it feels
   inclined.  [...]


(6)  Garbled text?

The last paragraph of Section 9, on page 55, says:

                                 [...].  Unless the "media-type" fact is
|  provided in a MLSx response nor is any advice given here that would
   allow determining the content type.  [...]
                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This sentence apparently is garbled a bit.  I suspect that it should
say:

                                 [...].  Unless the "media-type" fact is
|  provided in a MLSx response, no advice is given here that would allow
   determining the content type.  [...]
                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


I leave it to your decision whether to address these issues
by an RFC Errata Note, and which items to include there.
Preferrably, you should submit an Author's Errata Note, making
freely use of the material supplied above.  But if you like,
I can formally submit an Errata Note on my own, with your consent.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Matt,

I just finished reading 4821 cover to cover.  I found a couple typos, so
thought I would mention it in case you want to correct future versions:

   Since protocols that do not implement PLPMTUD are still subject to
   problems due to ICMP black holes, it may be desirable to limit to
   these protocols to "safe" MTUs likely to work on any path (e.g., 1280
   bytes).  Allow any protocol implementing PLPMTUD to operate over the
   full range supported by the lower layer.

There is an extra "to" in the first sentence.  It should read "...it may
be desirable to limit these protocols to safe MTUs....".

In the last one of the references at the end.....

   [frag-errors]   Heffner, J., "IPv4 Reassembly Errors at High Data
                   Rates", Work in Progress, December 2007.


The year is clearly wrong.

The rest of the document is very good.  Are you aware of any TCP
implementations that implement PLPMTUD, or even any diagnostic tools
that might simulate its behavior similar to how tracepath might test
PMTUD?  I think I would like to experiment with this a bit, especially
over some links where we are having "issues".

RFC-Editor,

Unfortunately I have to report some errors found by observant readers. I
can confirm all the errors reported and suggest publication on your
errata page whenever possible.

Clive D.W. Feather <clive_AT_demon.net>  and Henrik Levkowetz
<henrik_AT_levkowetz.com> found errors in the forms of SFS representation
for SFS V/KAL and SFS Y/RTT:

Section 3.4

  OLD:
                   SFS       \0/     \0__     0/_     0/

                   IP-SFS    RTT    unused

And Henrik Levkowetz also found this one:

In Section 3. reference is made to sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2, which
don't exist.  I believe you meant to refer to 3.3 and 3.4 respectively:

  OLD:
    IP-SFS adapts the standard SFSS to encode an alphabet of 16 signals
    (flag patterns) to represent data values 0-15 (Section 3.2.1) and 9
    signals to represent control functions (Section 3.2.2).  With 16
    data signals, IP-SFS transmission is based upon 4-bit nibbles, two
    per octet.  Each of the signal patterns defined in Section 3.2 is
    called an SFS.

    signals, IP-SFS transmission is based upon 4-bit nibbles, two per
    octet.  Each of the signal patterns defined in Section 3.2 is called
    an SFS.

Alfred Hoenes <ah_AT_tr-sys.de> reports a word omission:

Section 4.3

  OLD:
    If the link partner ready to receive, it returns an RTR
    signal.

  NEW:
    If the link partner is ready to receive, it returns an RTR
    signal.            ^^^^

He also argues as follows:

  RFC 4824 completely fails to appropriatey point out the benefits and
  merits of IP-SFS, and to perform a fair comparison with industry
  standard strenght security for common wireless protocols.

  Apparently, IP-SFS provides for industry standard Wireless Equivalent
  Privacy (WEP).  It *is* a wireless protocol!
  Its interfaces do not consume electrical power (if used under daylight
  conditions) and do not produce any electromagnetical interference.
  The former property results in great applicability to developing
  economies that lack substantial ubiquitous electrical power
  distribution but have a lot of cheap manpower available,
  but it also makes IP-SFS great for countries with instable electrical
  power distribution systems, like the U.S. (and, yet currently still
  to a lesser degree, Europe).
  Both properties together make IP-SFS strictly immune to any modern
  cryptanalytical methods based on the variation of power consumption
  over time and to the suspected industry espionage by the electronical
  'sky ears' still deployed in Europe and otherwise mostly idle, since
  the end of the Cold War.

  Furthermore, IP-SFS apparently is very well suited for environments
  with stringent legal requirements for the war against the Axis of
  Evil, with its step-by-step increasing legal custody of privacy and
  political correctness of content to be performed / enforced by
  legal authorities and cooperating access and content providers.

  That should make IP-SFS particularly interesting for the emerging
  infrastructure of the .cn domain (and for many other countries,
  as well).

  To change the disadvantageous presentation of IP-SFS and to address
  at least a few of its benefits, I recommend to change, via an RFC
  Errata Note, the first paragraph of Section 5,

Section 5, first paragraph

  OLD:
    By its nature of line-of-sight signaling, IP-SFS is considered
    insecure.  The transmission of sensitive data over IP-SFS is
    strongly discouraged unless security is provided by higher level
    protocols.

  NEW:
    By its nature of line-of-sight signaling, IP-SFS is considered to
    provide industry strength wireless equivalent security and privacy
    (WEP).  The transmission of sensitive data over IP-SFS is strongly
    discouraged unless security is provided by legal environments or
    corporate guidelines of conduct, impending punishment of the
    interfaces, or other higher level protocols.

I hope you agree to the corrections suggested above. Again, thanks for
all the support!

Regards,
j.

Hello,
after studying the recently published RFC 4877 (MIPv6 with IKEv2)
authored by you, I would like to point out a few textual flaws I
found in the RFC text, and supply material for an appropriate RFC
Errata Note.  (The technical content seems to be reasonable to me.)

The items below are presented in RFC textual order.
I use change bars ('|' in column 1) and occasionally
up/down pointing marker lines ('^^^'/'vvv') to emphasize
the location of textual issues and/or proposed corrections.
Modified text has been re-adjusted to match RFC formatting
rules, where appropriate.


(1)  Section 3 -- word replications

The second-to-last paragraph of Section 3 of RFC 4877, on page 4,
says:

   The packet formats for tunneled mobile prefix discovery messages are
   very similar to the tunneled Binding Update and Binding
|  Acknowledgment with the with the home address as the source address
   in the inner IP header.
                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
It should say:

   The packet formats for tunneled mobile prefix discovery messages are
   very similar to the tunneled Binding Update and Binding
|  Acknowledgment with the home address as the source address in the
   inner IP header.


(2)  Section 4.2 -- suspected omission of verb

The last bullet of Section 4.2, on page 7, says:

   o  The home agent MUST use the Type 2 Routing header in Binding
      Acknowledgements and Mobile Prefix Advertisements sent to the
      mobile node when transport mode IPsec protection is used, again
|     due to the need to have the home address visible when the policy
      checks are made.

It should perhaps better say:

   o  The home agent MUST use the Type 2 Routing header in Binding
      Acknowledgements and Mobile Prefix Advertisements sent to the
      mobile node when transport mode IPsec protection is used, again
|     due to the need to have the home address be visible when the
      policy checks are made.
                                              ^^^^

(3)  Section 4.3 -- word omission

In the middle of the 4th bullet in Section 4.3 -- this is the first
paragraph on page 8 --, the RFC says:
                             v
|          [...].  The use of sequence number in the ESP header to
      provide anti-replay protection is optional because the sequence
      numbers in the Binding Updates provide anti-replay protection.

It should better say:
                             vvvvv
|          [...].  The use of the sequence number in the ESP header to
      provide anti-replay protection is optional because the sequence
      numbers in the Binding Updates provide anti-replay protection.

(4)  Section 5 -- plural missing

At the end of the item numbered '3.', Section 5 of RFC 4877 says,
near the bottom of page 10:
                                                             vvv
|                   [...].  This case uses IPsec tunnel mode SA with the
       protocol selector set to 'any'.

It should say:
                                                             vvvv
|                   [...].  This case uses IPsec tunnel mode SAs with
       the protocol selector set to 'any'.


Please comment.

All four items seem to be appropriate for an Errata Note.

Preferrably, you should submit an Author's Errata Note to the
RFC Editor's RFC Errata web pages, making freely use of the
material supplied above.  But if you like, I can formally
submit an Errata Note on my own, with your consent.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Unfortunately, here is an Errata for RFC 4828
(just out this week...).


RFC 4828 Errata:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Correcting a caption (deleting a decimal point, from Alfred Hines)

In Appendix B.1., the caption for Table 7 says the following:

                   (1.184 Kbps Maximum TFRC Data Sending Rate)

It should say:

                   (1184 Kbps Maximum TFRC Data Sending Rate)

Hello,
I've studied the recently published RFC 4728 (DSR) authored by you.

In general, this seems to be a very clear and technically complete
description, and well edited -- irrespective of the sheer size of
the text.

Notwithstanding that, I have found a few textual issues in that RFC.

The items below are presented in RFC textual order.
I use change bars ('|' in column 1) and occasionally
up/down pointing marker lines ('^^^'/'vvv') to emphasize
the location of textual issues and/or proposed corrections.
Modified text has been re-adjusted to match RFC formatting
rules, where appropriate.


(1)  Section 4.1

In the 4th paragraph on page 28 (this is the first bullet below
the non-indented text starting "Any suitable data structure ..."),
the RFC says:

   -  In DSR, the route returned in each Route Reply that is received by
      the initiator of a Route Discovery (or that is learned from the
|     header of overhead packets, as described in Section 8.1.4)
      represents a complete path (a sequence of links) leading to the
      destination node.  [...]

In this case, I'm quite sure it was inteded to not talk about
"overhead" packets, but (promiscuously) "overheard" packets!
Hence, the RFC should say:

   -  In DSR, the route returned in each Route Reply that is received by
      the initiator of a Route Discovery (or that is learned from the
|     header of overheard packets, as described in Section 8.1.4)
      represents a complete path (a sequence of links) leading to the
      destination node.  [...]


(2)  Section 6.4

On page 44, the explanation for "Opt Data Len" says:

         [...]
         When the Opt Data Len is greater than that required for
         the fixed portion of the Route Error plus the necessary
|        Type-Specific Information as indicated by the Option Type
         value in the option, the remaining octets are interpreted as
         extensions.  [...]

As can be seen from the context, the "Type-Specific Information" is
dependent on the "Error Type" field value, not the "Option Type"
field value.
Hence, the RFC should say:

         [...]
         When the Opt Data Len is greater than that required for
         the fixed portion of the Route Error plus the necessary
|        Type-Specific Information as indicated by the Error Type
         value in the option, the remaining octets are interpreted as
         extensions.  [...]


(3)  Section 6.5

Almost everywhere in Sections 6 and 7, the RFC is very explicit
in specifying the value of length fields, giving fixed values
or a formula, if necessary.
There are two exceptions, in Section 6.5 and 6.6 (see below).

The explanation in Section 6.5, on page 47, says:

      Opt Data Len

         8-bit unsigned integer.  Length of the option, in octets,
         excluding the Option Type and Opt Data Len fields.

This is generally true.  But in this case, special care is needed.
I strongly recommend to expand on this text, saying:

      Opt Data Len

         8-bit unsigned integer.  Length of the option, in octets,
         excluding the Option Type and Opt Data Len fields. In the
         basic form of this Option, this field has the value 2.
         (See Section 7.4.1 for an extended version of this Option.)

Note: Section 7.4.1 gives all the details you'll ever want,
      so just placing the pointer here is most efficient!


(4)  Section 6.6

As indicated in item (3) above, a similar lack of precision
can be found in Section 6.6, near the bottom of page 47.
The RFC says:

      Opt Data Len

         8-bit unsigned integer.  Length of the option, in octets,
         excluding the Option Type and Opt Data Len fields.

It should better say:

      Opt Data Len

         8-bit unsigned integer.  Length of the option, in octets,
         excluding the Option Type and Opt Data Len fields.  In this
         case, the value of this field is always 10.


(5)  Section 7.1 -- mismatch in terminology

There's a small terminological inconsistency in this Section.

The Flow State Header diagram on page 52 says:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|  |  Next Header  |F|  Hop Count  |        Flow Identifier        |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

Deviating from the term used there (and in the remainder of the text),
the explanation at the end of the section (still on page 52) says:

                   vvvvvv
|     Flow Identification

         The flow ID for this flow, as described in Section 3.5.1.

It should say:
                   vv
|     Flow Identifier

         The flow ID for this flow, as described in Section 3.5.1.


(6)  Section 8.2.1 -- missing article

The second-to-last paragraph of section 8.2.1, on page 66, says:
                                                        v
|  The behavior of a node processing a packet containing DSR Options
   header with both a DSR Source Route option and a Route Request option
   is unspecified.  [...]

It should better say:
                                                        vvv
|  The behavior of a node processing a packet containing a DSR Options
   header with both a DSR Source Route option and a Route Request option
   is unspecified.  [...]


(7)  Section 8.6.2

The procedure specified in Section 8.6.2 is a bit misleading in its
last step; if followed literally, it will mess up the packet in the
case that there is any Hop-by-Hop Options header present after the
IP header.

The procedure is (on page 88):

   -  Insert a DSR Flow State header after the IP header and any Hop-
      by-Hop Options header that may already be in the packet, but
      before any other header that may be present.

   -  Set the Next Header field of the DSR Flow State header to the Next
      Header field of the previous header (either an IP header or a
      Hop-by-Hop Options header).

   -  Set the Flow (F) bit in the DSR Flow State header to 1.

|  -  Set the Protocol field of the IP header to the protocol number
      assigned for DSR (48).
                                    ^^
The last step should say instead:
                                    vvvvvvvv
|  -  Set the Protocol field of the previous header to the protocol
      number assigned for DSR (48).

Note: I have reused wording from the second step because
that's exactly where the new header gets 'plugged in'..


Please comment.

IMHO, all these items seem to be appropriate for an Errata Note;
in particular, items (1), (2), (5) and (7) SHOULD be addressed.

Preferrably, you should submit an Author's Errata Note to the
RFC Editor's RFC Errata web pages, making freely use of the
material supplied above.  But if you like, I can formally
submit an Errata Note on my own, with your consent.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Alfred,

Thank you very much for your careful read of the DSR RFC!

Going through your points one by one, here's my thoughts on them.

1) - agreed
2) - I need to go check
3) - agreed
4) disagree.  I'd prefer the original wording.
5) - agreed
6) - agreed
7) - agreed

Dave, Yih-Chun - any preference on the path forward?  Shall we submit an Author's Errata as Alfred suggests?

-dam

Hello,
after studying the recently published RFC 4872 (GMPLS E2E Recovery)
authored by you, I would like to submit a few comments, pointing
out some issues I found with the RFC text, and supplying material
for an appropriate RFC Errata Note.

The items below are presented in RFC textual order.
I use change bars ('|' in column 1) and occasionally
up/down pointing marker lines ('^^^'/'vvv') to emphasize
the location of textual issues and/or proposed corrections.
Modified text has been re-adjusted to match RFC formatting
rules, where appropriate.


(1)  Section 14.1

Within the explanations for the PROTECTION Object, on mid-page 32
RFC 4872 says:

|     Reserved: 5 bits
                ^
It should say:

|     Reserved: 6 bits
                ^
Rationale:
  See the artwork of the object on page 31 and count the bits!


(2)  Section 15.1

(2a)
The first paragraph of Section 34, on top of page 34, says:

   The primary path route is specified via the PRIMARY_PATH_ROUTE object
   (PPRO).  The Primary Path Route Class Number (Class-Num) of form
|  0bbbbbbb 38.
           ^
It should say:

   The primary path route is specified via the PRIMARY_PATH_ROUTE object
   (PPRO).  The Primary Path Route Class Number (Class-Num) of form
|  0bbbbbbb is 38.
           ^^^^
or even:

   The primary path route is specified via the PRIMARY_PATH_ROUTE object
   (PPRO).  The Primary Path Route Class Number (Class-Num) of form
|  0bbbbbbb assigned by IANA is 38.
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Rationale: grammar.

(2b)
The second-to-last paragraph of Section 34, just below the artwork
on page 34, says:

   The contents of a PRIMARY_PATH_ROUTE object are a series of
|  variable-length data items called subobjects (see Section 15.3).
                                                                ^
It should say:

   The contents of a PRIMARY_PATH_ROUTE object are a series of
|  variable-length data items called subobjects (see Section 15.2).
                                                                ^
Rationale: See headline and content of Section 15.2 !


(3)  Section 15.2

Within Section 15.2, the first paragraph on page 35 says:

|  An empty PPRO with no subobjects is considered illegal.  If there is
|  no first subobject, the corresponding Path message is also in error,
   and the receiving node SHOULD return a PathErr message with the new
   error code/sub-code "Routing Problem/Bad PRIMARY_PATH_ROUTE object".

According to the text, PPROs are only admitted in Path messages.
PPROs "with no first subobject" carry no subobjects at all.
It is unclear why the text tries to distinguish these 'too cases'
and uses the word, "also", in the second sentence.

Something significant might have been lost in the text,
which cannot be concluded from the context.
In this case, please supply the missing clues.
Otherwise, the RFC should say unambiguously:

|  An empty PPRO with no subobjects is considered illegal.  A node
|  receiving an empty PPRO SHOULD return a PathErr message with the new
   error code/sub-code "Routing Problem/Bad PRIMARY_PATH_ROUTE object".


(4)  Section 16

The second paragraph of Section 16 is a literal restatement of the
first sentence of the same section, on the same page (37).
Therefore, the last text line of Section 16,

   The ASSOCIATION object is used to associate LSPs with each other.

should be deleted.


(5)  Section 16.2

The last paragraph of Section 16.2, on page 39, says (including the
spurious blank line):

|   [...]  Similarly, terminating nodes receiving a Path message with a
|
|  PROTECTION object requiring association between working and recovery
|  LSPs MUST include an ASSOCIATION object.  Otherwise, such nodes MUST
   return a PathErr message with the new error code/sub-code "Routing
   Problem/PROTECTION object not Applicable".

The first sentence quoted IMHO does not make sense: The *receiver*
of a Path message cannot include anything into that message.
I strongly suspect that this text is garbled and should in fact state
precisely:

|   [...]  Similarly, a Path message with a PROTECTION object requiring
|  association between working and recovery LSPs MUST include an
|  ASSOCIATION object.  Terminating nodes receiving such Path message
|  without an ASSOCIATION object MUST return a PathErr message with the
   new error code/sub-code "Routing Problem/PROTECTION object not
   Applicable".


(6)  Section 17

The first paragraph of Section 17 does not confine the scope of the
specification as it would be appropriate.

The text says:

|  This section presents the RSVP message-related formats as modified by
|  this document.  Unmodified RSVP message formats are not listed.

It should say:
                                 vvv
|  This section presents the RSVP-TE message-related formats as modified
|  by this document.  Unmodified RSVP-TE message formats are not listed.
                                     ^^^
Rationale:
  'Classic' RSVP (RFC 2205) is neither covered nor affected by the
  subsequently specified message formats.


(7)  Section 18

The 4th paragraph of Section 18 (on page 40) says:

   [...]                                       v
|  In the case, when the same level of security provided by [RFC2747] is
   desired, the standard IPsec based integrity and authentication can be
   used as explained in [RFC3473].

It should say:

   [...]                                       vvvv
|  In the case, when the same level of security as provided by [RFC2747]
   is desired, the standard IPsec based integrity and authentication can
   be used as explained in [RFC3473].


Please comment.

IMHO, all items above seem to be appropriate for an Errata Note.

Preferrably, you should submit an Author's Errata Note to the
RFC Editor's RFC Errata web pages, making freely use of the
material supplied above.  But if you like, I can formally
submit an Errata Note on my own, with your consent.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
after studying the recently published RFC 4873 (GMPLS Segment
Recovery) authored by you, I would like to submit a few comments,
pointing out some issues I found with the RFC text, and supplying
material for an appropriate RFC Errata Note.

The items below are presented in RFC textual order.
I use change bars ('|' in column 1) and occasionally
up/down pointing marker lines ('^^^'/'vvv') to emphasize
the location of textual issues and/or proposed corrections.
Modified text has been re-adjusted to match RFC formatting
rules, where appropriate.


(1)  Section 2

Near the end of the second-to-last paragraph on page 5, RFC 4873 says:

                                                        [...].  The
   branch node of a recovery LSP creates an SRRO by copying the RRO from
|  the Resv message of associated recovery LSP into a new SRRO object.
   Any SRROs present in the recovery LSP's Resv message are also copied.

It should say:
                                                        [...].  The
   branch node of a recovery LSP creates an SRRO by copying the RRO from
|  the Resv message of the associated recovery LSP into a new SRRO
   object.  Any SRROs present in the recovery LSP's Resv message are
   also copied.

Rationale:  missing article.


(2)  Section 3.2

On page 7, the last sentence of Section 3.2 says:

|              [...].  This object MUST NOT be used when association is
   made according to the methods defined in [RFC4090].

It should say:

|              [...].  This object MUST NOT be used when an association
   is made according to the methods defined in [RFC4090].

Rationale:  missing article.


(3)  Section 4.1

On page 8, Section 4.1 says:

                   [...].  This includes the definition of subobjects
|  defined for EXPLICIT_ROUTE object.  The class of the
   SECONDARY_EXPLICIT_ROUTE object is 200 (of the form 11bbbbbb).

It should say:

                   [...].  This includes the definition of subobjects
|  defined for the EXPLICIT_ROUTE object.  The class of the
   SECONDARY_EXPLICIT_ROUTE object is 200 (of the form 11bbbbbb).

Rationale:  missing article.


(4)  Section 4.2

In the second paragraph on page 10, Section 4.2 says:

|  At a branch node, the SERO, together with the Path message of LSP
   being recovered, provides the information to create the recovery LSP.
   [...]

It should say:

|  At a branch node, the SERO, together with the Path message of the LSP
   being recovered, provides the information to create the recovery LSP.
   [...]

Rationale:  missing article.


(5)  Section 4.2.1

Near the bottom of page 10, the first paragraph of Section 4.2.1 says:

                                                          [...].  The
|  processing of these events depend on a number of factors.

It should say:
                                                          [...].  The
|  processing of these events depends on a number of factors.
                                    ^
Rationale:  grammar.


(6)  Section 4.2.3

The first sentence in Section 4.2.3 (on page 12),

|  In general, objects in a recovery LSP are created based on the
|  corresponding objects in the LSP being protected.  [...]

IMHO makes use of too sluggish language; talking about
"objects in a recovery LSP" or "objects in the LSP being protected"
should be avoided because it messes up the essentials of [G]MPLS,
the separation of the data plane carrying arbitrary labeled data
packets and the control plane (with RSVP-TE carrying the TE objects).
Unfortunately, similar language recurs at other places in the RFC;
for the sake of brevity, I refrain from listing all those instances
below.

I would appreciate very much future derived and/or related work to
return to a more precise language.


(7)  Section 4.2.4

Still on page 12, Section 4.2.4 says:

   Recovery LSP removal follows standard procedures defined in [RFC3209]
|  and [RFC3473].  This includes with and without setting the
|  administrative status.

It remains unclear whether there has been some text inadvertently
lost in the second sentence, or if that is another instance of
rather sluggish language, which should be avoided according to all
published RFC authoring guidelines.


(8)   Section 4.3.1

(8a)
The third paragraph of Section 4.3.1 (on page 13) says:

|  Branch and merge nodes SHOULD also add a NOTIFY_REQUEST object to the
   LSP being protected.

This is another outstanding instance of the issue mentioned in
item (6) above.

(8b)
The final bullet on page 14 says:

   o new text:
      If a message contains multiple NOTIFY_REQUEST objects, only the
|     first object used is in notification.  Subsequent NOTIFY_REQUEST
      objects MUST be propagated in the order received.

Again, it is unclear whether text has been lost, or "the ... object
used is in notification" is another instance of very sluggish and
inprecise language.

Perhaps, the text was intended to say:

   o new text:
      If a message contains multiple NOTIFY_REQUEST objects, only the
|     first object is used to potentially trigger a notification.
      Subsequent NOTIFY_REQUEST objects MUST be propagated in the order
      received.


(9)  Section 4.3.2

The second sentence of Section 4.3.2 says:

|                      [...].  When a branch or merge node receives
   notification of an LSP failure and it is unable to recover from that
   failure, [...]

It should say:
|                      [...].  When a branch or merge node receives a
   notification of an LSP failure and it is unable to recover from that
   failure, [...]

Rationale:  missing article.


(10)  Section 5.1

The first paragraphh of Section 5.1 says:

   The format of a SECONDARY_RECORD_ROUTE object is the same as a
   RECORD_ROUTE object, Class number 21.  This includes the definition
   of subobjects defined for RECORD_ROUTE object.  The class of the
   SECONDARY_RECORD_ROUTE object is 201 (of the form 11bbbbbb).

It should say:

|  The format of a SECONDARY_RECORD_ROUTE object is the same as for a
   RECORD_ROUTE object, Class number 21.  This includes the definition
   of subobjects defined for the RECORD_ROUTE object.  The class of the
   SECONDARY_RECORD_ROUTE object is 201 (of the form 11bbbbbb).

Rationale:
a) improper comparison:  *format* of an object <--> another object;
b) missing article.


(11)  Section 6.1

The first paragraph of Section 6.1, on page 16, says:

   LSP Segment Recovery Flags are carried in the PROTECTION object of
|  the same C-Type defined in [RFC4872].  The format of the flags are:

It should say, e.g.:

   LSP Segment Recovery Flags are carried in the PROTECTION object of
|  C-Type 2 defined in [RFC4872].  The format of the modifed PROTECTION
|  object carrying these flags is:

Rationale:
a) language
b) The second sentencs is wrong.  The subsequent diagram depicts
   *the full object*, not only the (new) *flags* (in the third word
   of the object) !  The proposed word "modified" could also be
   replaced by "updated" or "amended".


(12)  Section 6.2

(12a)
The last sentence of the third paragraph of Setcion 6.2,
on mid-page 17, says:

                                                             [...].  The
   dynamically identified information, together with the Path message of
|  LSP being recovered, is used to create the recovery LSP.

It should say:
                                                             [...].  The
   dynamically identified information, together with the Path message of
|  the LSP being recovered, is used to create the recovery LSP.

Rationale:  missing article.

(12b)

The rules given in the two paragraphs on top of page 18,

   The resulting Path message is used to create the recovery LSP.  While
   the recovery LSP exists, the PROTECTION object in the original Path
   message  (unless overridden by local policy) MUST also be updated
   with the In-Place bit set (1).  From this point on, Standard Path
   message processing is used in processing the resulting and original
   Path messages.

   The merge node of a dynamically controlled recovery LSP SHOULD reset
   (0) the In-Place bit in the PROTECTION object of the outgoing Path
   message associated with the terminated recovery LSP.

apparently make dynamic 'overlapping' segment protection impossible.

One scenario that came to my mind was node failure protection
envisioned to be implemented by recovery LSPs for the primary LSP
A-B-C-D-E-F-G, depicted as follows:

                  H ----- I   J ----- K
                 /         \ /         \
          A --- B --- C --- D --- E --- F --- G
           \         / \         / \         /
            L ----- M   N ----- O   P ----- Q

The specified rules apparently inhibit the setup of such overlapping
segment protection LSPs.  Has this been intended ?


(13)  Section 7

As in RFC 4872, Section 17, the first paragraph of Section 7 in
RFC 4873 does not confine the scope of the specification as it
would be appropriate.

The text says:

|  This section presents the RSVP message related formats as modified by
   this document.  Where they differ, formats for unidirectional LSPs
   are presented separately from bidirectional LSPs.

It should say:
                                 vvv
|  This section presents the RSVP-TE message related formats as modified
   by this document.  Where they differ, formats for unidirectional LSPs
   are presented separately from bidirectional LSPs.

Rationale:
  'Classic' RSVP (RFC 2205) is neither covered nor affected by the
  subsequently specified (extended) message formats.



Please comment.

IMHO, at least items (11) and (13) should be addressed by and
RFC Errata Note.

Preferrably, you should submit an Author's Errata Note to the
RFC Editor's RFC Errata web pages, making freely use of the
material supplied above.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

In Section 3 of RFC 4742 the example should read as follows:

  [user@client]$ ssh -s server.example.org -p 830 netconf

Similarly, the paragraph above indicates port <830>.  This should simply 
read as port 830.

Thank you for your attention,

Subject: RFC 4851 errata

Hello,
despite of all the effort that went into the final version of
your EAP-FAST specification, I unfortunately found some more
flaws in the recently published RFC 4851.  The items below are
listed in RFC textual order; item (5) is the most important one.


(1)  Section 3.2.1 -- terminological mismatch

Only in this section, the RFC uses the spelling "SessionID" (4 x);
throughout the remainder of the text, "Session ID" is used.


(2)  Section 3.2.3 -- typo

In the 3rd text line of Section 3.2.3, on page 12,
the RFC test:

             ... contains a empty Session ID
should say:
             ... contains an empty Session ID
                            ^

(3)  Section 3.3.1 -- typo

In the second line of the last paragraph of Section 3.3.1,
on page 13, the RFC text:

             ... If either indicates failure. then the method is
should say:
             ... If either indicates failure, then the method is
                                            ^

(4)  Section 3.7 -- typo

In the first line of the second paragraph of Section 3.7,
the RFC text:

   Since EAP is an lock-step protocol, [...]
                 ^
should say:

   Since EAP is a lock-step protocol, [...]


(5)  Section 4.2.9 -- missing specification

At the bottom of page 31, something strange must have happened,
causing the 'Action' code points to be dropped from the final text.

The RFC says:

      Action

         The Action field is two octets.  Values include:

|           Process-TLV

|           Negotiate-EAP
         ^

It should say:

      Action

         The Action field is two octets.  Values include:

|        1  Process-TLV

|        2  Negotiate-EAP
         ^

(6)  Section 5.5 -- typo

In the third line of Section 5.5 (on page 35), as in many other
places in the RFC, the initial

   Where

should be

   where


(7)  Section 6 -- inconsistent use of established terms

The RFC 2434 requirements terms are spelled inconsistently.
For uniformity, at the bottom of page 36,

           ... based on specifications required ...
                        ^            ^ ^
should be:
           ... based on Specification Required ...

and in the fourth line on page 37,

           ... on a specification required basis ...
                    ^             ^
should be:
           ... on a Specification Required basis ...


(8)  Section 7.4.1 -- typos

there are two typos in the last part of the first paragraph
of Section 7.4.1; the lines on top of page 40,
                      vvv
|  is unauthenticated an may not have any relevance to the authenticated
   identity.  EAP-FAST implementations should not attempt to compare any
   identity disclosed in the initial cleartext EAP Identity response
|  packet with those Identities authenticated in Phase 2
                                                        ^
should say:
                        v
|  is unauthenticated and may not have any relevance to the authenticated
   identity.  EAP-FAST implementations should not attempt to compare any
   identity disclosed in the initial cleartext EAP Identity response
|  packet with those Identities authenticated in Phase 2.
                                                        ^

[For clarity, I have not re-adjusted to RFC margins the modified text.]



Item (5) apparently is a significant flaw that should be addressed
by an RFC Errata Note as soon as possible.  I leave it to your
choice whether to include more of the items listed above, as well,
making freely use of the material supplied above.

Kind regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
after studying the recently published RFC 4866 (IP6 Enhanced
Route Optimization) authored by you, I would like to point
out three issues I found with the RFC text.


(1)  Section 4.2 -- mis-specification ?

Within Section 3.2, in the first paragraph on page 21, RFC 4866
twice specifies:
                                                         vvvvvvv
   ... the lifetime for the binding SHOULD be set to the maximum
   of MAX_xx_BINDING_LIFETIME and the value specified in the
   Lifetime field of the Binding Update message.

where '_xx_' is '_CGA_' and '_RR_', respectively.
The text then continues:
                                                     vvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
   The correspondent node may in either case grant a further reduced
   lifetime, but it MUST NOT accept a higher lifetime.

Apparently the former specification does not make sense to me,
and it does not match the latter:
Taking the *maximum* of the Lifetime field of the message and
a constant might *increase* the value, thus subsequently talking
about *further reducing* it is weird.

I strongly suspect that the word "maximum" should have been "minimum"
in both instances in that paragraph.


(2)  Section 4.5 -- under-specification

Within Section 4.5, the third paragraph on page 26 points to the
algorithm defined in Section 6 of RFC 3972 [2], but it does not
specify all the arguments required as input to that algorithm;
it does not specify the CGA Message Type tag to be used in
calculating the CGA signature.

Later on in the RFC, Section 4.6 (on page 27), when describing
the CGA signature verification process, specifies the use of the
message tag given in Section 7 of RFC 4866.

For completeness and consistency, suitable text resembling the
last part of the last sentence of Section 4.6 should be added
to the third paragraph on page 26.

E.g., the sentence,

              [...].  The value is calculated with the mobile or
   correspondent node's private key over the following sequence of
   octets:

should better say:

              [...].  The value is calculated with the mobile or
|  correspondent node's private key and the CGA Message Type tag of
|  Enhanced Route Optimization as defined in Section 7, over the
   following sequence of octets:


(3)  CGA Specification -- missing Reference ?

The definition of the CGA parameter structure from RFC 3972
recently has been updated by RFC 4581.
Although RFC 4866 does not deal with the details of that structure,
for clarity, IMHO it should have specified whether this update
applies to the CGA parameters catrried in the CGA Parameters Option.
Otherwise, the sentence in Section 5.1, near the top of page 33,

   CGA Parameters

      This field contains up to 255 bytes of the CGA Parameters data
      structure defined in [2].  [...]

might be understood as excluding the update per RFC 4581, which most
probably was not intended.  To avoid this interpretation, the above
sentence should be corrected to say:

      This field contains up to 255 bytes of the CGA Parameters data
      structure as originally defined in [2] and recently updated in
      [2'].

and adding to Section 10.1 another Reference [2'] pointing to RFC 4581.



Please comment.

If you agree with the arguments presented, it might be worth to
address all these issues by an RFC Errata Note.

Preferrably, you should submit an Author's Errata Note to the
RFC Editor's RFC Errata web pages, making freely use of the
material supplied above.  But if you like, I can formally
submit an Errata Note on my own, with your consent.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
after studying the recently published RFC 4823 (EDIINT AS3)
authored by you, I would like to submit a few comments, pointing
out some issues I found with the RFC text, and supplying material
for an appropriate RFC Errata Note.


(A)

First of all, it is annoying to find this RFC notoriously neglecting
contemporary standard IETF terminology, using the sluggish and
confusing "header" where in fact "header field" should be used.

Please refer to RFC 2822, RFC 3864, RFC 4021, and RFC 4249
for the proper definitions of the established IETF terminology.

To quote from page 3 of RFC 4249:

3.1.1.  Standard Terminology

   Terms related to the Internet Message Format are defined in
   [N2.RFC2822].  Authors specifying extension header fields should use
   the same terms in the same manner in order to provide clarity and
   avoid confusion.  For example, a "header" [I1.FYI18], [N2.RFC2822] is
   comprised of "header fields", each of which has a "field name" and
   usually has a "field body".  Each message may have multiple
   "headers", viz. a message header and MIME-part [N4.RFC2046] headers.

   A message header has a Date header field (i.e., a field with field
   name "Date").  However, there is no "Date header"; use of such non-
   standard terms is likely to lead to confusion, possibly resulting in
   interoperability failures of implementations.

There's only a single place in the RFC where the correct term,
"header field" is used!

There are much too many instances of this primary issue to mention
in detail -- there are roughly 60 instances of this flaw, starting
with the title of Section 5, in the ToC, "AS3-Specific Headers".


(B)

Further textual flaws are presented in RFC textual order.
I use change bars ('|' in column 1) and occasionally
up/down pointing marker lines ('^^^'/'vvv') to emphasize
the location of textual issues and/or proposed corrections.
Modified text has been re-adjusted to match RFC formatting
rules, where appropriate.


(1)  Section 2.3.1  -- indentation

In Section 2.3.1, the second-to-last list item on page 5 says:

                      vv
|  Non-repudiation of NRR is a "legal event" that occurs when the
   receipt (NRR)        original sender of an EDI/EC interchange has
                        verified the signed receipt coming back from the
                        receiver.  NRR IS NOT a functional or a
                        technical message.

It should say:
                      vv
|  Non-repudiation of   NRR is a "legal event" that occurs when the
   receipt (NRR)        original sender of an EDI/EC interchange has
                        verified the signed receipt coming back from the
                        receiver.  NRR IS NOT a functional or a
                        technical message.


(2)  Section 3.7

The RFC says:

   This Internet RFC defines how a Message Disposition Notification
|  (MDN)is requested, as well as the format and syntax of the MDN.  [..]

It should say:

   This Internet RFC defines how a Message Disposition Notification
|  (MDN) is requested, as well as the format and syntax of the MDN.  [..]
        ^

(3)  Section 6.3.2

Beyond issue (A), there are multiple other flaws in the text of
Section 6.3.2; the RFC says (on page 16):

                          [...].  The Content-Transfer-Encoding header
   SHOULD NOT be used; if the header is present, it SHOULD have a value
   of binary or 8-bit.  The absence of this header or the use of
   alternate values such as "base64" or "quoted-printable" MUST NOT
   result in transaction failure.  Content transfer encoding of MIME
   parts within the AS3 message are similarly constrained.

It should say:

                          [...].  The Content-Transfer-Encoding header
|  field SHOULD NOT be used; if this header field is present anyway, it
|  SHOULD have a value of binary or 8-bit.  The absence of this header
|  field or the use of alternate field values such as "base64" or
|  "quoted-printable" MUST NOT result in transaction failure.  The
|  Content-Transfer-Encoding of MIME bodies within the AS3 message is
|  similarly constrained.

Note:
Usually, only the *body* of a MIME entity (a RFC 2822 message or a MIME
body part) is subject to transfer encoding -- cf. RFC 2045, Section 2;
the MIME header (yes, in this case it's the `header`!) is subject to
encoding according to RFC 2047 and RFC 2231.  Thus, it is essential
here to distinguish precisely between these terms.


(4)  Section 7.4.1

Unlike, e.g., Section 4.2, the message structures depicted in
Section 7.4.1, on pages 23/24, are imprecise and misleading;
'message/disposition-notification' is *not* the atomic MIME entity
shown in the text; according to RFC 3798, the MDN is encapsulated
in a 'multipart/report', which has a mandatory first body part
of type 'text/plain', not shown in the current text.
Because RFC 4823 explicitely quotes RFC 822 (should better be 2822!),
RFC 2045, and RFC 3798, I strongly suspect that the specification
indeed wanted to re-use the MDN structure specified in RFC 3798.
This is supported by subsequent details exposed in Section 7.4.2.

Furthermore, the RFC text there introduces a notation that is not
made use of anywhere in the RFC.  That sentence is to be deleted.

Section 7.4.1 of RFC 4823 says:

   The AS3-MDN follows the MDN specification [6] except where noted in
   this section.  The modified entity definitions in this document use
   the vertical-bar character, '|', to denote a logical "OR"
   construction.  Refer to RFC 2045 for the format of MIME-message-
   headers.

     The format of the AS3-MDN is

     MDN, no signature

       -RFC822/2045
         -RFC3798 (message/disposition-notification)

<<page break>>

     MDN, signature

       -RFC822/2045
         -RFC1847 (multipart/signed)
           -RFC3798 (message/disposition-notification)
           -RFC3851 (application/pkcs7-signature)

It should say:

   The AS3-MDN follows the MDN specification [6] except where noted in
|  this section.  Refer to RFC 2045 for the format of MIME headers.

|  The format of the AS3-MDN is

     MDN, no signature

|      -RFC2822/2045
|        -RFC3462 (multipart/report;
|                  report-type=disposition-notification)
|          -RFC2046 (text/plain)
|          -RFC3798 (message/disposition-notification,
|                    as modified by Section 7.4.2)

     MDN, signature

|      -RFC2822/2045
         -RFC1847 (multipart/signed)
|          -RFC3462 (multipart/report;
|                    report-type=disposition-notification)
|            -RFC2046 (text/plain)
|            -RFC3798 (message/disposition-notification)
           -RFC3851 (application/pkcs7-signature)

Note:
I have omitted the third, optional body part of the 'multipart/report'
-- cf. the final remark (#4) at the end of Appendix A.2 of RFC 4823,
which recommends against making use of it.


(5)  Section 7.4.4

Item 8 in Section 7.4.4, on page 27 says:

   8.  The "failed" disposition type MAY NOT be used for the situation
       in which there is some problem in processing the message other
|      than interpreting the request for an MDN.  The "processed" or
|      other disposition type with appropriate disposition modifiers is
       to be used in such situations.

The ABNF given in Section 7.4.3, on page 25,

     AS3-disposition-type = "processed" / "failed"

explicitely excludes `other` disposition types.

Therefore, the above bullet should be corrected to say:

   8.  The "failed" disposition type MAY NOT be used for the situation
       in which there is some problem in processing the message other
|      than interpreting the request for an MDN.  The "processed"
|      disposition type with appropriate disposition modifiers MUST be
       used in such situations.

Note:
I also have balanced the use of RFC 2119 formal specification language
in the modified text.
Note to the RFC-Editor/bb:  cf. your note on RFC 4866   :-)


(6)  Section 9

Quoting S/MIME Version 2 for encryption strength and 40-bit encryption
is ridiculously outdated, IMHO !
Unfortunately, it is still necessary to remind readers that 56-bit
strength (DES) is much too weak today!


(7)  Appendix A.2

Near the bottom of page 38, there's a typo in the Note #1.
The RFC says:
                     v
|     1. The lines proceeded with "&" are what the signature is
         calculated over.

It shoud say:
                     v
|     1. The lines preceeded with "&" are what the signature is
         calculated over.



Please comment.

Preferrably, you should submit an Author's Errata Note to the
RFC Editor's RFC Errata web pages, making freely use of the
material supplied above.  But if you like, I can formally
submit an Errata Note on my own, with your consent.

Kind regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
after studying the recently published RFC 4779 (IPv6 BB Deployment
Scenarios) authored by you, I would like to submit a few comments,
pointing out many of the issues I found with the RFC text, and
supplying material for an appropriate RFC Errata Note.

The items below are presented in RFC textual order.
I use change bars ('|' in column 1) and occasionally
up/down pointing marker lines ('^^^'/'vvv') to emphasize
the location of textual issues and/or proposed corrections.
Modified text has been re-adjusted to match RFC formatting
rules, where appropriate.


(1)  Section 5.2 -- bad acronym expansion

Within Section 5.2, bullet B. on page 11 says:

   B.  Problems with IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) on CM and CMTS.  In
|      IPv4, these devices rely on Internet Group Multicast Protocol
       (IGMP) join messages to track membership of hosts that are part
       of a particular IP multicast group.  [...]

It should say:

   B.  Problems with IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) on CM and CMTS.  In
|      IPv4, these devices rely on Internet Group Management Protocol
       (IGMP) join messages to track membership of hosts that are part
       of a particular IP multicast group.  [...]


(2)  Section 5.2.1.3 -- typo / missing article

The first paragraph of Section 5.2.1.3, on top of page 14 says:

                                                 [...].  In order to do
   that, the CM and CMTS must forward Neighbor Discovery (ND) packets
|  between ER and the hosts attached to the CM.
          ^
It should say:

                                                 [...].  In order to do
   that, the CM and CMTS must forward Neighbor Discovery (ND) packets
|  between the ER and the hosts attached to the CM.
          ^^^^^


(3)  Section 5.2.1.4 -- typo / missing article

The first paragraph of Section 5.2.1.4, on mid-page 14 says:

                    [...].  If there is a GWR present, it will also use
|  static default route to the ER.

It should say:

                    [...].  If there is a GWR present, it will also use
|  a static default route to the ER.
   ^^


(4)  Section 5.2.2 -- typo / missing article

On page 15, the text for scenario #2 says:

   [...]
   This scenario is also easy to deploy since the cable operator just
|  needs to add GWR at the customer site.
               ^
It should say:

   [...]
   This scenario is also easy to deploy since the cable operator just
|  needs to add a GWR at the customer site.
               ^^^


(5)  Section 5.2.2.2.3 -- wrong article

On page 18, the second paragraph of Section 5.2.2.2.3 says:

   The GWR will use its IPv4 address to source the tunnel to the ER.
|  The tunnel endpoint will be the IPv4 address of the ER.  [...]
                               ^^^
It should say:

   The GWR will use its IPv4 address to source the tunnel to the ER.
|  The tunnel endpoint will be an IPv4 address of the ER.  [...]
                               ^^

Rationale:
  Since IP addresses usually identify *interfaces* and routers
  presumably have more than one IP interface, it is improper
  to talk about *the* IP address of a router.


(6)  Section 5.2.2.3 -- improper text in figure ?

On page 19, Figure 5.2.2.3 is:

                           +-----------+   +-------------+
     +-----+  +-------+    |   Cable   |   | CMTS / Edge |
     |Host |--|  CM   |----|  (HFC)    |---|             |=>ISP
     +-----+  +-------+    |  Network  |   |   Router    | Network
                           +-----------+   +-------------+

|    |-------||---------------------------||---------------|
|     IPv4/v6              IPv4/v6              IPv4/v6

Because all parts of the network shown are dual-stack, it makes
no sense to show two boundaries between similar regions.
Hence, the figure should better be:

                           +-----------+   +-------------+
     +-----+  +-------+    |   Cable   |   | CMTS / Edge |
     |Host |--|  CM   |----|  (HFC)    |---|             |=>ISP
     +-----+  +-------+    |  Network  |   |   Router    | Network
                           +-----------+   +-------------+

|    |-----------------------------------------------------|
|                          IPv4/v6


(7)  Section 5.2.2.5.2

The first paragraph of Section 5.2.2.5.2, at the bottom of page 22,
says:

   Since the CM/GWR is dual stack, it can receive an IPv4 or IPv6
   address using DHCP for management purposes.  As the GWR functionality
|  is embedded in the CM, it will need an IPv6 address for forwarding
   data traffic.  IPv6 address assignment for the CM/GWR and host can be
   done via DHCPv6 or DHCP-PD.

Apparently, to be able to *forward* IPv6 traffic, the GWR needs at least
two IPv6 addresses.  Therefore, the RFC should perhaps better say:

   Since the CM/GWR is dual stack, it can receive an IPv4 or IPv6
   address using DHCP for management purposes.  As the GWR functionality
|  is embedded in the CM, it will need IPv6 addresses for forwarding
   data traffic.  IPv6 address assignment for the CM/GWR and host can be
   done via DHCPv6 or DHCP-PD.


(8)  Section 5.2.3 -- missing articles

The first paragraph of Section 5.2.3 says, at the top of page 24:

                          [...].  MLDv2 is almost identical to IGMPv3
|  and also supports ASM (Any-Source Multicast) and SSM (Source-Specific
   Multicast) service models.

It should say:

                          [...].  MLDv2 is almost identical to IGMPv3
|  and also supports the ASM (Any-Source Multicast) and the SSM (Source-
   Specific Multicast) service models.


(9)  Section 6.2.1.2 -- typo

On page 30, the bullet B. within Section 6.2.1.2 says:

             v
       The later option allows it to contact a remote DHCPv6 server, if
       needed.  [...]

It should say:
             vv
|      The latter option allows it to contact a remote DHCPv6 server, if
       needed.  [...]


(10)  Section 6.2.2 -- typo

In the last paragraph on page 31, Section 6.2.2 says:

                                 v
|  This solution scales better then the Point-to-Point, but since there
   is only one PPP session per ATM PVC, the subscriber can choose a
   single ISP service at a time.

It should say:
                                 v
|  This solution scales better than the Point-to-Point, but since there
   is only one PPP session per ATM PVC, the subscriber can choose a
   single ISP service at a time.


(11)  Section 6.3 -- clarity

The last paragraph of Section 6.3 (second paragraph on page 39) says:

   This facilitates the deployment of multicast services.  The
   discussion of this section applies to all the multicast sections in
|  the document.
     ^
It should say:

   This facilitates the deployment of multicast services.  The
   discussion of this section applies to all the multicast sections in
|  this document.
     ^^

(12)  Section 6.3.1 -- grammar / typos

The first paragraph of Section 6.3.1, on page 39, says:
      v
|  Any Source Multicast (ASM) is useful for Service Providers that
   intend to support the forwarding of multicast traffic of their
   customers.  It is based on the Protocol Independent Multicast -
   Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) protocol and it is more complex to manage
   because of the use of Rendezvous Points (RPs).  With IPv6, static RP
|  and Bootstrap Router [BSR] can be used for RP-to-group mapping
   similar to IPv4.  [...]

It should say:
      v
|  Any-Source Multicast (ASM) is useful for Service Providers that
   intend to support the forwarding of multicast traffic of their
   customers.  It is based on the Protocol Independent Multicast -
   Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) protocol and it is more complex to manage
   because of the use of Rendezvous Points (RPs).  With IPv6, static RP
|  and Bootstrap Routers [BSR] can be used for RP-to-group mapping
   similar to IPv4.  [...]

Alternatively, the last sentence above could be reworded to say:

   because of the use of Rendezvous Points (RPs).  With IPv6, static RP
|  and the Bootstrap Router protocol [BSR] can be used for RP-to-group
   mapping similar to IPv4.  [...]


(13)  Section 8.1 -- multiple flaws

Near the end of the first paragraph on page 56, Section 8.1 says:

              [...].  The AP forwards all the packets coming to/from
|  host to the Edge Router.  The underlying connection between the AP
|  and Edge Router could be based on any access layer technology such as
   HFC/Cable, FTTH, xDSL, etc.

It should say:

              [...].  The AP forwards all the packets coming to/from
|  hosts to the Edge Router.  The underlying connection between the AP
|  and the Edge Router could be based on any access layer technology
   such as HFC/Cable, FTTH, xDSL, etc.

In the second paragraph on page 56, Section 8.1 says:

|                [...].  In most of the cases, SP assigns a limited
   number of public IP addresses to its customers.  [...]

It should say:
                                               vvvv
|                [...].  In most of the cases, the SP assigns a limited
   number of public IP addresses to its customers.  [...]

At the end of the section (near the bottom of page 56), the RFC says:

|  A. Layer 2 NAP with Layer 3 termination at NSP Edge Router

|  B. Layer 3 aware NAP with Layer 3 termination at Access Router

It should say either:

|  A. Layer 2 NAP with Layer 3 termination at an NSP Edge Router

|  B. Layer 3 aware NAP with Layer 3 termination at an Access Router

or:

|  A. Layer 2 NAP with Layer 3 termination at NSP Edge Routers

|  B. Layer 3 aware NAP with Layer 3 termination at Access Routers


(14)  Section 8.1.1 -- grammar

The first paragraph of Section 8.1.1, at the bottom of page 56, says:

   When a Layer 2 switch is present between AP and Edge Router, the AP
|  and Layer 2 switch continues to work as a bridge, forwarding IPv4 and
   IPv6 packets from WLAN Host/Router to Edge Router and vice versa.

It should say:

   When a Layer 2 switch is present between AP and Edge Router, the AP
|  and Layer 2 switch continue to work as a bridge, forwarding IPv4 and
   IPv6 packets from WLAN Host/Router to Edge Router and vice versa.


(15)  Section 8.1.2

On page 59, the second paragraph of Section 8.1.2 says:

   When the WLAN Host initiates the connection, the AAA authentication
|  and association process with WLAN AP will be similar, as explained in
   Section 8.1.1.
                               ^                       ^
It should say:

   When the WLAN Host initiates the connection, the AAA authentication
|  and association process with the WLAN AP will be similar as explained
   in Section 8.1.1.
                               ^^^^^                       ^

(16)  Section 8.1.2.2 -- clarification needed

On page 60, bullet C. of Section 8.1.2.2 says:

       vv                                                             vv
|  C.  It can use its link-local address to communicate with the ER.  It
       can also dynamically acquire through stateless auto-configuration
       the address for the link between itself and the ER.  [...]

The double "it" is unclear and inprecise.  (The immediately preceding
sentences refer to three different entities, the DHCP server, the
Access Router, and the Edge Router -- which one is "it" ?)

Presumably, it was intended to refer to the Access Router, and not to
the AAA Server, but -- according to Figure 8.1.2 -- only the latter
potentially has a common link with the ER and hence can use link-local
addresses, whereas the AR is connected to the ER via the Access
Provider Network that might comprise multiple IP hops on the route
from AR to ER.

Please supply replacement text matching the scenario as explained
in Section 8.1.2.


(17)  Section 8.1.2.3 -- missing article

The last paragraph of Section 8.1.2.3, on mid-page 61, says:

   If the Access Router is owned by the SP, then the Access Router will
|  also run IPv6 IGP, and will be part of the SP IPv6 routing domain
   (OSPFv3 or IS-IS).  [...]

It should say:

   If the Access Router is owned by the SP, then the Access Router will
|  also run an IPv6 IGP, and will be part of the SP IPv6 routing domain
   (OSPFv3 or IS-IS).  [...]


(18)  Section 8.1.3 -- missing articles

Section 8.1.3, near the bottom of page 61, says:

   PPP Terminated Aggregation (PTA) and L2TPv2 Access Aggregation (LAA)
   models, as discussed in Sections 6.2.2 and 6.2.3, respectively, can
   also be deployed in IPv6 WLAN environment.

It should say:

|  The PPP Terminated Aggregation (PTA) and L2TPv2 Access Aggregation
   (LAA) models, as discussed in Sections 6.2.2 and 6.2.3, respectively,
|  can also be deployed in an IPv6 WLAN environment.


(19)  Section 8.1.3.1 -- missing articles

At the bottom of page 61, the first paragraph Section 8.1.3.1 says:
                                   v
|  While deploying the PTA model in IPv6 WLAN environment, the Access
   Router is Layer 3 aware and it has to be upgraded to support IPv6.

It should say:
                                   vvvv
|  While deploying the PTA model in an IPv6 WLAN environment, the Access
   Router is Layer 3 aware and it has to be upgraded to support IPv6.

The bottom line on page 61,
                                            v
|  Figure 8.1.3.1 describes the PTA Model in IPv6 WLAN environment.

should say:
                                            vvvv
|  Figure 8.1.3.1 describes the PTA Model in an IPv6 WLAN environment.

Alternatively, "the" could be inserted in place of "an", in both cases.


(20)  Section 8.1.3.2

On page 62, the literally same changes as presented in item (19)
should be applied as well.


(21)  Section 8.2 -- multiple grammar issues

The first paragraph on top of page 64 says:

                                  vvvvv
|  It is important to note that in the shared wireless environments,
   multicast can have a significant bandwidth impact.  [...]

It should say:
                                  v
|  It is important to note that in shared wireless environments,
   multicast can have a significant bandwidth impact.  [...]

The second paragraph on page 64 says:

                          vvvvvv
|  The IPv6 WLAN Hosts can also join desired multicast groups as long as
   they are enabled to support MLDv1 or MLDv2.  [...]

It should say:
                          v
|  The IPv6 WLAN Hosts can join desired multicast groups as long as they
   are enabled to support MLDv1 or MLDv2.  [...]

(Rationale:
 "also" lacks similar context in preceding that might be resumed here.)

The third paragraph on page 64 says:
                                        vvvvv
|                [...].  The Edge Router has also needs to be enabled
|  for PIM-SSM in order to receive joins from IPv6 WLAN Hosts or WLAN/
   Access Router (if present), and send joins towards the SP core.

It should say:
                                        v
|                [...].  The Edge Router also needs to be enabled for
|  PIM-SSM in order to receive joins from IPv6 WLAN Hosts or the WLAN/
   Access Router (if present), and send joins towards the SP core.

The sixth paragraph on page 64 says:
                                    vvvvv
|  This problem is inherited by WLAN that can impact both IPv4 and IPv6
   multicast packets; it is not specific to IPv6 multicast.

It should say:
                                    vvvvv
|  This problem is inherited by WLANs and can impact both IPv4 and IPv6
   multicast packets; it is not specific to IPv6 multicast.

Finally, the last paragraph on page 64 says:
                       v
|  While deploying WLAN (IPv4 or IPv6), one should adjust their
   broadcast/multicast settings if they are in danger of dropping
   application dependent frames.  [...]

It should say:
                       vv
|  While deploying WLANs (IPv4 or IPv6), one should adjust their
   broadcast/multicast settings if they are in danger of dropping
   application dependent frames.  [...]


(22)  Section 8.3 -- improper article

The third paragraph of Section 8.3, on mid-page 65 says:

        [...]  The same IPv4 QoS concepts and methodologies should be
|  applied for the IPv6 as well.
              ^^^^^
It should say:

        [...]  The same IPv4 QoS concepts and methodologies should be
|  applied for IPv6 as well.
              ^

(23)  Section 8.4 -- word twister

The first paragraph of Section 8.4, near the bottom of page 65, says:

                                                  vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
|  There are limited changes that have to be done for WLAN the Host/
   Router in order to enhance security.  [...]

It should say:
                                                  vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
|  There are limited changes that have to be done for the WLAN Host/
   Router in order to enhance security.  [...]


(24)  Section 10

The last sub-item of item (21) above recurs in Section 10.
At the end of bullet E. , near the bottom of page 72, the RFC says:

                        vvvvv
                                            [...].  This problem is
|      inherited by WLAN that can impact both IPv4 and IPv6 multicast
       packets; it is not specific to IPv6 multicast.

It should say:
                        vvvvv
                                            [...].  This problem is
|      inherited by WLANs and can impact both IPv4 and IPv6 multicast
       packets; it is not specific to IPv6 multicast.



Please comment.

At least item (1) should urgently be addressed by an Errata Note.
IMHO, item (16) should also be resolved on this way.
I leave it to your decision what else should be included there.

Preferrably, you should submit an Author's Errata Note to the
RFC Editor's RFC Errata web pages, making freely use of the
material supplied above.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
quite some time ago, I had studied RFC 3971 (SEND) authored by you,
but I did not find the time to submit the marginal notes I had made.
The recent publication of RFC 4866 and its relationship via CGA to
SEND now has pushed me to come back to RFC 3971 and perform this
task now.

The comments below point out some issues I found with the RFC
text and supply material for an appropriate RFC Errata Note.

The items below are presented in RFC textual order.
I use change bars ('|' in column 1) and occasionally
up/down pointing marker lines ('^^^'/'vvv') to emphasize
the location of textual issues and/or proposed corrections.
Modified text has been re-adjusted to match RFC formatting
rules, where appropriate.


(1)  Section 2 -- wrong reference tags

Near the bottom of page 5, Section 2 of RFC 3971 says:

   Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP)

|     The IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol [7, 8].

      The Neighbor Discovery Protocol is a part of ICMPv6 [6].

It should say:

   Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP)

|     The IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol [4, 5].

      The Neighbor Discovery Protocol is a part of ICMPv6 [6].

Rationale:
  See Section 12.1, on page 50; the proper references are
  RFC 2461 [4] and RFC 2462 [5].

Subsequently, on top of page 6, RFC 3971 says:

   Non-SEND node

      An IPv6 node that does not implement this specification but uses
      only the Neighbor Discovery protocol defined in RFCs 2461 and
|     2462, as updated, without security.
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^
It should say:

   Non-SEND node

      An IPv6 node that does not implement this specification but uses
      only the Neighbor Discovery protocol defined in RFCs 2461 and
|     2462, without security.

Rationale:
  Perhaps, there once was a reference to some work in progress,
  e.g., what has become RFC 4311, or the 2461bis and 2462bis I-Ds,
  and this reference was been removed only partially.  Cleanup!
  For an alternative text change, see the next item.


(2)  Section 3 -- clarification ?

At the bottom of page 6, Section 3 says:

                         [...]  This section is not normative, and if
   this section and the original Neighbor Discovery RFCs are in
|  conflict, the original RFCs, as updated, take precedence.
                                ^^^^^^^^^^^

It is unclear what has been inteded here.  The rationale above
might apply here as well.  Or was it intended to say:

                         [...]  This section is not normative, and if
   this section and the original Neighbor Discovery RFCs are in
|  conflict, the original RFCs, or any updates to these, take
   precedence.
                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Please comment.


(3)  Section 6.4.1 -- spurious word / grammar, and a clarification

(3a)
On page 30, the explanation for 'Source Address' in Section 6.4.1 says:

         A link-local unicast address assigned to the sending interface,
|        or to the unspecified address if no address is assigned to the
         sending interface.

It should say:

         A link-local unicast address assigned to the sending interface,
|        or the unspecified address if no address is assigned to the
         sending interface.

(3b)
The last paragraph of Section 6.4.1, at the bottom of page 31,
(as quoted below) has several issues.

First of all, this sentence apparently does *not* belong to the
discussion of `Valid Options` above it; hence, it should be indented
one step less.

Next, I propose to add an initial article, 'The'.

But most importantly, I suspect that the ICMP lenght specification,
 >= 8 , in fact should be:  > 8 .
Unfortunately I cannot find a precise statement specifying clearly
that the Trust Anchor option is mandatory in the Certification Path
Solicitation Message, but the explanation 9 lines before the end of
the section,

         The first (or only) Trust Anchor option MUST contain a DER
         Encoded X.501 Name; see Section 6.4.3.

IMHO in fact does imply this.

If that is correct, the final line,

|     ICMP length (derived from the IP length) MUST be 8 or more octets.

should say:

|  The ICMP length (derived from the IP length) MUST be greater than 8
   octets.


(4)  Section 6.4.2 -- clarification

Similar to the rationale for item (3b) above, I suspect that
the Certification Path Advertisement Message will always include
at least one Option.

Therefore, the last paragraph of Section 6.4.2, on mid-page 34,

      The ICMP length (derived from the IP length) MUST be 8 or more
      octets.

should say:

   The ICMP length (derived from the IP length) MUST be greater than 8
   octets.


(5)  Section 6.4.3 -- mis-specification ?

At the bottom of page 34, Section 6.4.3 contains the explanation:

   Length

      The length of the option (including the Type, Length, Name Type,
|     Pad Length, and Name fields), in units of 8 octets.
                  ^^^^^^^^^

It should say:

   Length

      The length of the option (including the Type, Length, Name Type,
|     Pad Length, Name, and Padding fields), in units of 8 octets.
                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Rationale:
  See the explanation for the 'Padding' field, at the bottom of page 35.


(6)  Section 6.4.4 -- mis-specification ?

On page 36, Section 6.4.4 contains the explanation:

   Length

      The length of the option (including the Type, Length, Cert Type,
|     Pad Length, and Certificate fields), in units of 8 octets.
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It should say:

   Length

      The length of the option (including the Type, Length, Cert Type,
|     Reserved, Certificate, and Padding fields), in units of 8 octets.
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Rationale:
  Apparently, there's no 'Pad Length' field in the Certificate Option;
  the artwork on top of page 36 shows a 'Reserved' field in the same
  octet where the Trust Anchor Option carries a 'Pad Length' field,
  and the text contains a description of that 'Reserved' field.
  According to the explanation for the 'Padding' field at the bottom
  of page 36, the length of the 'Padding' field must be derived
  implicitely from the ASN.1 encoding of the 'Certificate' field,
  and the 'Length' field comprises the length of the 'Padding' field.

Note:
  Because the extensible format potentially allows for other Cert Type
  values and other Certificate encodings, I am in doubt whether the
  decision to include a Reserved octet in place of a Pad Length octet
  was very wise.
  The current description of the 'Reserved' field will admit a future
  revision of that decision.


(7)  Section 6.4.5 vs. Section 6.4.6 -- contradiction!

The first paragraph of Section 6.4.5, on page 37, says:

                                      [...].  Future, backward-
|  compatible changes to the protocol may specify the contents of the
|  Reserved field or add new options; backward-incompatible changes may
   use different Code values.  [...]

Contrary to that, the first paragraph of Section 6.4.6, on page 38,
says:

                                       [...].  Future, backward-
|  compatible changes to the protocol MAY specify the contents of the
|  Reserved field or add new options; backward-incompatible changes MUST
   use different Code values.  [...]

I suspect that the first "may" above should be a "MAY" and the second
"may" should have been a "MUST" as well.

If that's correct, the first paragraph of Section 6.4.5 should say:

                                      [...].  Future, backward-
|  compatible changes to the protocol MAY specify the contents of the
|  Reserved field or add new options; backward-incompatible changes MUST
   use different Code values.  [...]


(8)  Section 6.4.6 -- missing article

On top of page 39, at the end of the first paragraph there,
Section 6.4.6 says:

     [...].  If there are multiple missing certificates, additional CPS
|  messages can be sent after getting a response to first one.  However,
   the complete retrieval process may last at most CPS_RETRY_MAX
   seconds.

It should say:

     [...].  If there are multiple missing certificates, additional CPS
|  messages can be sent after getting a response to the first one.
   However, the complete retrieval process may last at most
   CPS_RETRY_MAX seconds.


(9)  Section 7.4 -- a spurious and a missing article

(9a)
The first paragraph of Section 7.4, on page 41, says:

         [...].  This specification also does not apply to addresses
|  generated by the IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration from a
   fixed interface identifiers (such as EUI-64).
                             ^                                   ^^
It should say:

         [...].  This specification also does not apply to addresses
|  generated by the IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration from fixed
   interface identifiers (such as EUI-64).

(9a)
The last paragraph of Section 7.4, on page 42, says:
                        v
|  The Target Address in Neighbor Advertisement is required to be equal
   to the source address of the packet, except in proxy Neighbor
   Discovery, which is not supported by this specification.

It should say:
                        vvv
|  The Target Address in a Neighbor Advertisement is required to be
   equal to the source address of the packet, except in proxy Neighbor
   Discovery, which is not supported by this specification.


(10)  Section 9.1 -- missing article

The third paragraph of Section 9.1, at the bottom of page 44, says:
                   v
|  There may not be cryptographic binding in SEND between the link layer
   frame address and the IPv6 address.  An unsecured link layer could
   allow nodes to spoof the link layer address of other nodes.

It should say:
                   vvv
|  There may not be a cryptographic binding in SEND between the link
   layer frame address and the IPv6 address.  An unsecured link layer
   could allow nodes to spoof the link layer address of other nodes.


Please comment.

Most items seem to be appropriate for an Errata Note; some need
resolution.

Preferrably, you should submit an Author's Errata Note to the
RFC Editor's RFC Errata web pages, making freely use of the
material supplied above.

Hello,
after studying the recently published RFC 4875 (P2MP Extensions
to RSVP-TE) edited by you, I would like to submit a few comments,
pointing out some issues I found with the RFC text, and supplying
material for an appropriate RFC Errata Note.

The items below are presented in RFC textual order.
I use change bars ('|' in column 1) and occasionally
up/down pointing marker lines ('^^^'/'vvv') to emphasize
the location of textual issues and/or proposed corrections.
Modified text has been re-adjusted to match RFC formatting
rules, where appropriate.


(1)  Section 4.5 -- syntax / punctuation issue

In the first paragraph of Section 4.5, on page 7, RFC 4875 says:
                                           vv
|           [...].  The < [<EXPLICIT_ROUTE>], <S2L_SUB_LSP> > tuple
   represents the S2L sub-LSP and is referred to as the sub-LSP
   descriptor.  [...]

Obviously, the tagged comma should be *inside* the square brackets:
                                           vv
|           [...].  The < [<EXPLICIT_ROUTE>,] <S2L_SUB_LSP> > tuple
   represents the S2L sub-LSP and is referred to as the sub-LSP
   descriptor.  [...]

The same issue recurs in the third paragraph of Section 4.5, on the
same page.

At similar places in the RFC, e.g. in the first paragraph of
Section 5.2.1, the comma is omitted entirely in the tuple notation.
That is very unusual.


(2)  Section 5.2.1 -- typo (text reformatting problem ?)

In the 5th line of the last-paragraph of Section 5.2.1,
    "Sub- Group"   should be spelled   "Sub-Group" .


(3)  Section 6.1 -- bad internal reference, and missing article

Within Section 6.1, the first text lines on page 17 say:

|  The S2L sub-LSP flow descriptor has the same format as S2L sub-LSP
|  descriptor in section 4.1 with the difference that a
   P2MP_SECONDARY_RECORD_ROUTE object is used in place of a P2MP
   SECONDARY_EXPLICIT_ROUTE object.  [...]

The RFC should say, inserting the missing article and correcting
the reference to point to Section 5.1 :

|  The S2L sub-LSP flow descriptor has the same format as the S2L
|  sub-LSP descriptor in section 5.1 with the difference that a
   P2MP_SECONDARY_RECORD_ROUTE object is used in place of a P2MP
   SECONDARY_EXPLICIT_ROUTE object.  [...]


(4)  Section 6.2 -- missing article

The second paragraph of Section 6.2, on mid-page 17, says:

                                 [...].  When the integrity bit is set
|  in the LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTE object, Resv message MUST NOT be sent
   upstream until all Resv messages have been received from the
   downstream neighbors.

It should say:

                                 [...].  When the integrity bit is set
|  in the LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTE object, a Resv message MUST NOT be sent
   upstream until all Resv messages have been received from the
   downstream neighbors.


(5)  Section 8.2 -- text duplication and inconsistency

The second paragraph of Section 8.2 (on page 23),

   A transit LSR sets the Sub-Group Originator ID in the FILTER_SPEC
   object(s) of a Resv message to the value that was received in the
   corresponding Path message.  If any of the incoming Resv messages
   corresponding to a single Path message carry a RESV_CONFIRM object,
   then the LSR MUST include a RESV_CONFIRM object in the corresponding
   Resv message that it sends upstream.  If the Sub-Group Originator ID
   is its own address, then it MUST set the receiver address in the
   RESV_CONFIRM object to this address, else it MUST propagate the
   object unchanged.

should be deleted entirely !

Rationale:
  The first two sentences in this paragraph are repeated almost
  literally in the subsequent (third) paragraph of the section.
  The third (last) sentence above essentially is superseeded, in
  a more precise manner, by the second and the third bullet at the
  bottom of page 23.
  But, perhaps most importantly, the first bullet there handles a
  subcase not covered by, and hence mis-specified, by that sentence!

  Apparently, the lower half of page 23 is a revised revision of
  the quoted second paragraph, which should have been deleted.


(6)  Section 10.2 -- clarification including mismatched angle
                     brackets, word omissions, and punctuation

Within Section 10.2, the third paragraph on page 26 says:

   [...]
|  A newly received Path message that matches SESSION object and Sender
   Tunnel Address, LSP ID, Sub-Group Originator ID> with existing Path
|  state carrying the same or different Sub-Group_ID, referred to Sub-
|  Group_ID(n) is processed as follows:

It should say:

   [...]
|  A newly received Path message that matches in SESSION object and
|  <Sender Tunnel Address, LSP ID, Sub-Group Originator ID> with
|  existing Path state carrying the same or a different Sub-Group_ID,
|  referred to as Sub-Group_ID(n), is processed as follows:

Or even better, a bit reworded for enhanced readability:

   [...]
|  A newly received Path message with SESSION object and <Sender Tunnel
|  Address, LSP ID, Sub-Group Originator ID> tuple matching existing
|  Path state carrying the same or a different Sub-Group_ID, referred to
|  as Sub-Group_ID(n), is processed as follows:


(7)  Section 11.3

Established language in IETF (and other) publications is "tear down",
not simply "tear", when it comes to the deletion of connections etc.

Therefore, while not really wrong, I would have appreciated the
following changes:

- in the 5th line of the 3rd paragraph of Section 11.3 (on page 28):
       "It does not tear any other branches ..."
  -->  "It does not tear down any other branches ..."

- in the 5th paragraph of Section 11.3, in the last text line on p.28:
       "... that are explicitely torn ..."
  -->  "... that are explicitely torn down ..."

[ I note this minor issue just for consideration in the preparation
  of future / derived work. ]


(8)  Section 15.1.2 -- another typo

On page 31, in the 6th line of the first paragraph of Section 15.1.2,

  "being backed- up"  should be  "being backed up"

[ The hyphenated form, "backed-up" is only appropriate in adverbial
  context, e.g., "a backed-up LSP". ]


(9)  Section 16 -- typo/grammar

Within Section 16, the third paragraph on page 34 says:

   There maybe overhead for an operator to configure ...

It should say:

   There may be overhead for an operator to configure ...
            ^

Rationale: Otherwise, the sentence lacks of a verb.


(10)  Section 17 -- bad internal reference

Within Section 17, in the second paragraph on page 35, the reader
is referred to:
                 "Figure 2 in section 24"
which should be:
                 "Figure 2 in Appendix A"


(11)  Section 18 -- typo (text reformatting problem ?)

Within Section 18, at the bottom of page 35,
    "re- merge"  should be  "re-merge"


(12)  Section 19

(12a) -- lack of precision / completeness

The sub-sections of Section 19 mostly remain a bit unspecific with
respect to Class *numbers* (only Section 19.3 does supply these),
whereas C-Type values always are specified fully.

For uniformity and completeness, and for the ease of the reader,
the following changes/amendments (determined after IANA lookup)
should be applied -- adopting the style of the RFC text from
Section 19.3 --, to the lines immediately above the class data
structure diagrams (I use abbreviated, diff-like notation):

o  in Section 19.1.1 (on mid-page 39):

   Class = SESSION, P2MP_LSP_TUNNEL_IPv4 C-Type = 13
--
   SESSION Class = 1, P2MP_LSP_TUNNEL_IPv4 C-Type = 13

o  in Section 19.1.2 (on page 40):

   Class = SESSION, P2MP_LSP_TUNNEL_IPv6 C-Type = 14
--
   SESSION Class = 1, P2MP_LSP_TUNNEL_IPv6 C-Type = 14

o  in Section 19.2.1 (on top of page 41):

   Class = SENDER_TEMPLATE, P2MP_LSP_TUNNEL_IPv4 C-Type = 12
--
   SENDER_TEMPLATE Class = 11, P2MP_LSP_TUNNEL_IPv4 C-Type = 12

o  in Section 19.2.2 (on top of page 42):

   Class = SENDER_TEMPLATE, P2MP_LSP_TUNNEL_IPv6 C-Type = 13
--
   SENDER_TEMPLATE Class = 11, P2MP_LSP_TUNNEL_IPv6 C-Type = 13

o  in Section 19.4.1 (at the bottom of page 43):

   Class = FILTER_SPEC, P2MP LSP_IPv4 C-Type = 12
--
   FILTER_SPEC Class = 10, P2MP LSP_IPv4 C-Type = 12

o  in Section 19.4.2 (at the top of page 44):

   Class = FILTER_SPEC, P2MP LSP_IPv6 C-Type = 13
--
   FILTER_SPEC Class = 10, P2MP LSP_IPv6 C-Type = 13

o  in Section 19.5 (on page 44):

                       The class of the P2MP SERO is the same as the
   SERO defined in [RFC4873].
--
                       The class of the P2MP SERO is 200, as assigned
   for the SERO in [RFC4873].

o  in Section 19.6 (on page 44):

                The class of the P2MP SRRO is the same as the SRRO
   defined in [RFC4873].
--
                The class of the P2MP SRRO is 201, as assigned for
   the SRRO in [RFC4873].


(12b) -- unusual presentation

It is unusual to present the explanations of fields in a diagram
in a sequence that does not correspond to the sequence of the
fields therein.

Therefore, I would have appreciated it to find ...

o  in Section 19.2.1 (on page 41) the explanation for "LSP ID"
   not at the bottom of the list, but at the second position,
   below the explanation for "IPv4 tunnel sender address";

and

o  in Section 19.2.2 (on page 42) the explanation for "LSP ID"
   not at the bottom of the list, but at the second position,
   below the explanation for "IPv6 tunnel sender address";


(13)  Section 20.2 -- similar to (12a)

Contrary to Section 20.1, Section 20.2 is silent about the class
numbers.  As in item (12a) above, for consistency and completeness,
the following changes should be applied, in accordance with the
style of the IANA registry file and Section 20.1 :

   Class Name = SESSION
--
     1  Class Name = SESSION


   Class Name = SENDER_TEMPLATE
--
    11  Class Name = SENDER_TEMPLATE


   Class Name = FILTER_SPEC
--
    10  Class Name = FILTER_SPEC


   Class Name = SECONDARY_EXPLICIT_ROUTE (Defined in [RFC4873])
--
   200  Class Name = SECONDARY_EXPLICIT_ROUTE


   Class Name = SECONDARY_RECORD_ROUTE (Defined in [RFC4873])
--
   201  Class Name = SECONDARY_RECORD_ROUTE


[ Note:
  I have deleted the repeated refs to RFC 4873 for uniformity;
  this information is already present in Section 19, it might
  only have been interesting here for the IANA in the I-D phase. ]



Please comment.

I strongly recommend to at least address items (3), (5), (6),
and (10) by an RFC Errata Note; I leave it to your decision which
other items to include additionally; IMHO, items (1), (12a), and
(13) should get high priority among these.

Preferrably, you should submit an Author's Errata Note to the
RFC Editor's RFC Errata web pages, making freely use of the
material supplied above.

Kind regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
after studying the recently published RFC 4836 (revised MAU MIB)
authored/edited by you, I would like to submit a few comments,
pointing out some minor textual flaws I found in the RFC text.

Some of these are legacy flaws (I had decided not to report
previously) or instances of recurring editorial issues, but
some have been newly introduced.

The intent of this note is to make you aware of the issues,
and to possibly address these in future related / derived work.
Although published policy would perhaps admit the publication
of an RFC Errata Note, IMHO that is not necessary in this case.

The items below are presented in (almost) RFC textual order.
I use change bars ('|' in column 1) and occasionally
up/down pointing marker lines ('^^^'/'vvv') to emphasize
the location of textual issues and/or proposed corrections.
Modified text has been re-adjusted to match RFC formatting
rules, where necessary.


(1)  Section 3 -- 'rational' quotation -- [legacy]

At the end of the first paragraph of Section 3, on page 4 of RFC 4836,

|  "interface MAUs."
                  ^^
should be written as:

|  "interface MAUs".
                  ^^

Rationale: AFAICS, This is the only place left in the RFC violating
  RFC-Ed policy on 'rational' quotation.


(2)  Section 3.1 -- typos -- [new]

The third paragraph of Section 3.1 says:

|  In addition, the new definitions are added to the IANA-maintained MIB
|  module, to support Ethernet in the First Mile (EFM) and 10GBASE-CX4
   interfaces, defined in [...]

It should say:

|  In addition, new definitions are added to the IANA-maintained MIB
|  module to support Ethernet in the First Mile (EFM) and 10GBASE-CX4
   interfaces, defined in [...]

Rationale:
a) '*the* new definitions' seems to be inappropriate because these
   new definitions have not been introduced so far in the text;
b) the comma separates the subject and the verb in the sentence,
   which better should be avoided.


(3)  Section 3.2.1 -- typo / text formatting -- [new]

In the second paragraph of Section 3.2.1, in the 5th line from the
bottom of page 5,  "non- 10GBASE-W type"  should be spelled
"non-10GBASE-W type".

Note to the RFC-Ed:
  Aparently, this is a recurring text-reformatting problem
  which I have observed multiple times in various recent RFCs.
  According to my experience, matches to the regular expression
    /[a-z0-9]- [a-z0-9]/  (in case-ignoring mode)
  will help find similar problems -- unfortunately, there are
  perfectly feasible matches as well, but finding the candidate
  flaws as always is the first step required.  Maybe, something
  like that search can be added to your nits-checking toolkit.

(4)  Section 3.4 -- table formatting -- [new]

In the tables on pages 7 / 8, the structure of the IEEE Managed
Object names has been hidden even more by the added separator
lines.  E.g., in Table 1, on top of page 7, the table formatting
IMHO hides the fact that  "oMAU"  is the prefix to all subsequent
(partial) object names, and neaer the bottom of page 7, the
'group change' to the next prefix "oAutoNegotiation" is not
obvious any more.
Perhaps this is an artifact of new tools used.
The most simple suggestion for improving the visible grouping in
such tables that comes to my mind is to use modified separator lines
for grouping, and omit the column separator in group headlines, e.g.,

- on top of page 7, modify:

   +----------------------------------+--------------------------------+
   | IEEE 802.3 Managed Object        | Corresponding SNMP Object      |
   +----------------------------------+--------------------------------+
   | oMAU                             |                                |

An additional artifact has subtly changed the apparent semantics
in table 2, on page 8.  The 'Reason for exclusion' given for
oAutoNegotiation.aAutoNegLocalSelectorAbility in fact applies
to all three objetcs in the oAutoNegotiation group.  The published
form of the table does not properly represent this fact.  In HTML,
the corresponding cell could be given a vertical span of three rows.
Incorporating the modification for better grouping support proposed
above, the Table 2,

   +------------------------------------+------------------------------+

Note: I have also added the missing article in front of "MAU-MIB".


(5)  Section 4 (MAU-MIB Module)

(5a)  rpMauMediaAvailable -- missing article -- [new]

The DESCRIPTION clause in the rpMauMediaAvailable OBJECT-TYPE macro
invocation, at the bottom of page 16, says:
                                             v
|         DESCRIPTION "This object identifies Media Available state of
                      the MAU, complementary to the rpMauStatus.  [...]

It should say:
                                             vvvvv
|         DESCRIPTION "This object identifies the Media Available state
                      of the MAU, complementary to the rpMauStatus.
                      [...]

(5b)  ifMauMediaAvailable -- missing article -- [new]

Similarly to the preceding item, the DESCRIPTION clause in the
ifMauMediaAvailable OBJECT-TYPE declaration, on top of page 23, says:
                                             v
|         DESCRIPTION "This object identifies Media Available state of
                      the MAU, complementary to the ifMauStatus.  [...]

It should say:
                                             vvvvv
|         DESCRIPTION "This object identifies the Media Available state
                      of the MAU, complementary to the ifMauStatus.
                      [...]

(5c)  ifMauTypeListBits              (page 27
(5d)  ifMauAutoNegCapabilityBits     (page 33)
(5e)  ifMauAutoNegCapAdvertisedBits  (page 34)
(5f)  ifMauAutoNegCapReceivedBits    (page 34)

For completeness and uniformity, it would be useful to amend the
textual references to the bOther bit value in the DESCRIPTION clauses
of these OBJECT-TYPE declarations by adding the numerical value in
parentheses, as it has been done in all similar places in the text:

Change   "bOther"   -->   "bOther(0)" .

(5g)  ifMauAutoNegCapability -- tabular formatting -- [legacy]

The latest additions to the table in the DESCRIPTION clause of the
deprecated ifMauAutoNegCapability OBJECT-TYPE declaration have not
been aligned properly.
Near the top of page 32, the RFC says:

                       [...]
                       17       (reserved)
                       18       (reserved)
|                      19      100BASE-T2 half duplex mode
|                      20      100BASE-T2 full duplex mode
                               ^^
It should say:

                       [...]
                       17       (reserved)
                       18       (reserved)
|                      19       100BASE-T2 half duplex mode
|                      20       100BASE-T2 full duplex mode
                               ^^

(5h)  mauIfGrp100Mbs -- spurious blank line -- [legacy/repagination]

Perhaps as an artifact of the text reformatting (new pagination),
there now is a spurious blank line in the mauIfGrp100Mbs OBJECT-GROUP
macro invocation, on top of page 40.
The RFC says:

                      }
|
          STATUS      deprecated

It should say:

                      }
          STATUS      deprecated

Note to the RFC-Ed:
  This is a recurring artifact observed repeatedly in MIB modules,
  but also in other places; where older editions of the text
  (previous RFC or I-D) had a page break and this is removed
  in the RFC, sometimes such spurious blank line(s) remain.

(5i)  mauModRpCompl2 -- spurious blank line -- [legacy/repagination]

Similarly as above, the mauModRpCompl2 MODULE-COMPLIANCE macro
invocation contains a spurious blank line, after the 8th non-blank
text line on page 45.
The RFC says:

              GROUP       rpMauNotifications
|
              DESCRIPTION "Implementation of this group is recommended
                          for MAUs attached to repeater ports."

It should say:

              GROUP       rpMauNotifications
              DESCRIPTION "Implementation of this group is recommended
                          for MAUs attached to repeater ports."

(5j)  mauModIfCompl3 -- lost blank line -- [legacy/repagination]

In contrast to the two preceding items, in the mauModIfCompl3
MODULE-COMPLIANCE macro invocation, a separating blank line
has been lost.
At the top of page 46, the RFC says:

              GROUP       mauIfGrpAutoNeg2
              DESCRIPTION "Implementation of this group is mandatory
                          for MAUs that support managed
                          auto-negotiation."
              GROUP       mauIfGrpAutoNeg1000Mbps
              DESCRIPTION "Implementation of this group is mandatory
                          [...]

It should say:

              GROUP       mauIfGrpAutoNeg2
              DESCRIPTION "Implementation of this group is mandatory
                          for MAUs that support managed
                          auto-negotiation."
|
              GROUP       mauIfGrpAutoNeg1000Mbps
              DESCRIPTION "Implementation of this group is mandatory
                          [...]


(6)  Section 5 (IANA-MAU-MIB Module)

(6a)  IANAifMauTypeListBits TC -- formatting -- [legacy++]

The SYNTAX clause of the IANAifMauTypeListBits TEXTUAL-CONVENTION,
on page 48 of RFC 4836, contains three blank lines.
I suspect that these initially were intended to visually group
the lines according to the speed classes; but this was never
handled correctly; e.g., in :

       SYNTAX       BITS {
              bOther(0),          -- other or unknown
              bAUI(1),            -- AUI
              b10base5(2),        -- 10BASE-5
              bFoirl(3),          -- FOIRL
|
              b10base2(4),        -- 10BASE-2

a break would perhaps have been appropiate below bOther(0), not
below bFoirl(3), thus not disrupting the group of 10 Mbps MAU types,
i.e.:

       SYNTAX       BITS {
              bOther(0),          -- other or unknown
|
              bAUI(1),            -- AUI
              b10base5(2),        -- 10BASE-5
              bFoirl(3),          -- FOIRL
              b10base2(4),        -- 10BASE-2

In RFC 3636, there was a page break between the 10 Mbps MAU types
and the 100 Mbps MAU types; in RFC 4836, there's no separating blank
line there.
The addition of the new MAU types (on page 49) finally has made
this grouping scheme impossible/obsolete.

I therefore recommend to remove these embedded separating blank lines
from the IANA-MAU-MIB module at the next update, under the control of
the designated expert.

(6b)  IANAifMauMediaAvailable -- typo -- [new]

Within the DESCRIPTION clause of the IANAifMauMediaAvailable TC,
in the first line of the last paragraph on page 51, a comma has
been dropped.
For consistency of style and grammar, I recommend to change back
in the IANA-MAU-MIB module (at the next update) the line,

         For 10 Gb/s the enumerations map to value of the link_fault

to say:

         For 10 Gb/s, the enumerations map to value of the link_fault

(6c)  OBJECT IDENTITIES for MAU types -- visual enhancement

For enhanced readability, I also recommend to insert additional blank
lines below the ASN.1 comments, "-----  new since ..." in the section
listing the OBJECT IDENTITIES for MAU types.

This could be done at the next regular update of the IANA-MAU-MIB
module, at the places corresponding to page 56, 57, 59, and 60 in
RFC 4836, respectively; e.g. (on page 56), change

     ------ new since RFC 1515:
     dot3MauType10BaseTHD OBJECT-IDENTITY
        STATUS     current
        [...]
to:

     ------ new since RFC 1515:
|
     dot3MauType10BaseTHD OBJECT-IDENTITY
        STATUS     current
        [...]


(7)  Section 7 -- missing article -- [new]

The first paragraph of Section 7, on page 63, says:

                        v
|  This document defines first version of the IANA-maintained IANA-MAU-
   MIB module.  [...]

It should say:
                        vvvvv
|  This document defines the first version of the IANA-maintained IANA-
   MAU-MIB module.  [...]

Dear RFC Editor Team, PIM-DM authors!

Here are three Errata to RFC 3973 "Protocol Independent Multicast - Dense=
 Mode
(PIM-DM): Protocol Specification (Revised)".

In Section 4.6.1, it says:

   assert_metric
   my_assert_metric(S,G,I) {
     if (CouldAssert(S,G,I) =3D=3D TRUE) {
       return spt_assert_metric(S,G,I)
     } else {
       return infinite_assert_metric()
     }
   }

It should say:

   assert_metric
   my_assert_metric(S,G,I) {
     if (CouldAssert(S,G,I) =3D=3D TRUE) {
       return spt_assert_metric(S,I)
     } else {
       return infinite_assert_metric()
     }
   }

Rationale: In Section 4.6.1, spt_assert_metric(S,I) is defined to have tw=
o
parameters, not three.

In Section 4.6.1, it says:

   assert_metric
   spt_assert_metric(S,I) {
     return {0,MRIB.pref(S),MRIB.metric(S),my_addr(I)}
   }

It should say:

   assert_metric
   spt_assert_metric(S,I) {
     return {MRIB.pref(S),MRIB.metric(S),my_addr(I)}
   }

Rationale: In Section 4.6.1, assert_metric is defined to be a 3-tupel, no=
t a
4-tupel.

In Section 4.6.1, it says:

   assert_metric
   infinite_assert_metric() {
     return {1,infinity,infinity,0}
   }

It should say:

   assert_metric
   infinite_assert_metric() {
     return {infinity,infinity,0}
   }

Rationale: In Section 4.6.1, assert_metric is defined to be a 3-tupel, no=
t a
4-tupel.

Remark: In Section 4.7.10 it says, the 4th value is "The Rendezvous Point=
 Tree
bit. Set to 0 for PIM-DM. Ignored upon receipt."

Regards, Mark Doll.

P.S.: I already pointed this out to Andrew and the PIM WG mailing list ab=
out
two years ago, but therafter I forgot about it.

Hello,
after studying the RFC 4783 (GMPLS Alarm Info Signaling) edited by
you and published last December, I did not find the time to send
my comments quickly.  The recent publication of related RFCs has
now pushed me to resume the processing of my marginal notes.

Hereby, I would like to submit a few comments, pointing out some
issues I found with the RFC text, and supplying material future
consideration in derived work, for an eventual appropriate RFC
Errata Note, and for update directives to the IANA.

The items below are presented in RFC textual order.
I use change bars ('|' in column 1) and occasionally
up/down pointing marker lines ('^^^'/'vvv') to emphasize
the location of textual issues and/or proposed corrections.
Modified text has been re-adjusted to match RFC formatting
rules, where appropriate.


(1)  Section 3.1.1

(1a) -- enhancement

In the past, it has turned out to be a useful practice to
present constant values in diagrams of message (parts)
wherever appropriate.  That practice is a service to the
reader and it enhances the readability of the document.

Therefore, I would have appreciated fo find the constant values
listed in the TLV diagrams in section 3.1.1, on pages 6-8.

For instance, in the upper half of page 6, RFC 4783 says:

   The Reference Count TLV has the following format:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|     |              Type             |             Length            |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                        Reference Count                        |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

It might better have said:

   The Reference Count TLV has the following format:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|     |           Type = 512          |           Length = 8          |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                        Reference Count                        |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

(1b) -- typo / grammar / terminology

Near the end of Section 3.1.1, in the explanation for the Error
String field in the Error String TLV, at the top of page 9,
the RFC says:

                                     [...].  The contents of error
         string are implementation dependent.  [...]

It should better say either:

                                     [...].  The contents of error
|        strings are implementation dependent.  [...]
               ^
or, directly quoting the proper name of the field:
                                                             v
|                                    [...].  The contents of Error
|        String are implementation dependent.  [...]
         ^


(2)  Section 5 -- typo/grammar + missing article

On page 15, the RFC text in Section 5 says:

   IANA administered assignment of new values for namespaces defined in
   this document and reviewed in this section.

It should better say:

   vvvv
|  The IANA administered assignment of new values for namespaces defined
|  in this document is reviewed in this section.
                    ^^

(3)  Section 5.2 -- alignment and ref. tagging

On page 16, Section 5.2 says:

   IANA made the following assignments in the "Interface_ID Types"
   section of the "GMPLS Signaling Parameters" registry located at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/gmpls-sig-parameters.

      512 8 REFERENCE_COUNT     RFC 4783
      513 8 SEVERITY            RFC 4783
      514 8 GLOBAL_TIMESTAMP    RFC 4783
      515 8 LOCAL_TIMESTAMP     RFC 4783
      516 variable ERROR_STRING RFC 4783

There are multiple problems with that text:

a) Tabular alignment should be maintained for readability.

b) The IANA file contails full references, and hence the
   reference tags should be written in the usual [RFCxxxx] style.

c) The referenced "Interface_ID Types" section of the IANA file
   contains a third column entitled "Format"; yet, the above text
   does not specify the intended content of that column for the
   newly registered values.  Consequently, IANA has entered (by
   copy & paste from previous entries?) the nonsensical value
   "See below" into this column, for all 5 new lines ('below'
   in the IANA file, there is only the new section according to
   Section 5.3 of this RFC, and the References section!)

To address all these issues, including filling in the missing
column, the RFC should perhaps better say in Section 5.2
(substitute alternate text if you prefer):

   IANA made the following assignments in the "Interface_ID Types"
   section of the "GMPLS Signaling Parameters" registry located at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/gmpls-sig-parameters.

|  Type   Length  Format        Description                    Reference
|  -----  ------  ------------  -----------------------------  ---------
|    512       8  see RFC 4873  REFERENCE_COUNT                [RFC4783]
|    513       8  see RFC 4873  SEVERITY                       [RFC4783]
|    514       8  see RFC 4873  GLOBAL_TIMESTAMP               [RFC4783]
|    515       8  see RFC 4873  LOCAL_TIMESTAMP                [RFC4783]
|    516  varies  see RFC 4873  ERROR_STRING                   [RFC4783]

I strongly recommend to address this issue by an RFC Errata Note
and have the IANA update the "Interface_ID Types" section
accordingly.


(4)  Section 5.3

(4a) -- ref. tagging

As in item (3) b) above, the text in the table in Section 5.3
(on mid-page 16),
                                                v
|  Value       Name                              Reference
   ----------- -------------------------------- -----------------
   0x80000000  Reflect (R)                      [RFC3473/RFC3471]
   0x00000010  Inhibit Alarm Communication (I)  RFC 4783
   0x00000004  Testing (T)                      [RFC3473/RFC3471]
   [...]

should better say (also adjusting an alignment flaw):

|  Value       Name                             Reference
   ----------- -------------------------------- -----------------
   0x80000000  Reflect (R)                      [RFC3473/RFC3471]
|  0x00000010  Inhibit Alarm Communication (I)  [RFC4783]
   0x00000004  Testing (T)                      [RFC3473/RFC3471]
   [...]

(4b) -- missing IANA policy statement

Additionally, the RFC did not specify the assignment policy
for this new sub-reistry.  Should it be "Standards Action" ?

This should be formally decided, communicated to the IANA, and
documented in an associated note in the registry file.


(5)  Section 5.4 -- ref. tagging

Similarly as in (4a) above, the new registry line presented
in Section 5.4, near the bottom of page 16 says:

   31  Alarms                               RFC 4783

It should say:

   31  Alarms                               [RFC4783]



Please comment and decide on IANA action and posting of an
RFC Errata Note..

Preferrably, you should submit an Author's Errata Note to the
RFC Editor's RFC Errata web pages, making freely use of the
material supplied above.  But if you like, I can formally
submit an Errata Note on my own, with your consent.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
after studying the recently published RFC 4804 (MPLS TE / DS-TE
Aggregate Reservations) edited by you, I would like to submit a
few comments, pointing out some issues I found with the RFC text,
and supplying material for consideration in future derived work
and/or an eventual RFC Errata Note.
(Note: This message is not copied to your co-authors; please
arrange for internal dirstribution if deemed necessary. Thanks.)

The items below are presented in RFC textual order.
I use change bars ('|' in column 1) and occasionally
up/down pointing marker lines ('^^^'/'vvv') to emphasize
the location of textual issues and/or proposed corrections.
Modified text has been re-adjusted to match RFC formatting
rules, where appropriate.


(1)  Section 4.2 -- word omissions

Within Section 4.2, the first paragraph on page 11 says:

                                                        [...].  The
   Router Alert is not set in the E2E Path message.
|              ^
It should say:

                                                        [...].  The
   Router Alert bit is not set in the E2E Path message.
|              ^^^^^

Equally, tha first line of the third paragraph on page 11,
                                                           v
|  Regardless of the encapsulation method, the Router Alert is not set.

should say:
                                                           vvvvv
|  Regardless of the encapsulation method, the Router Alert bit is not
   set.


(2)  Section 4.4 -- another word omission

As above, in the second-to-last paragraph of Section 4.4, on page 12,
the RFC says:
                                                 [...].  The
|  Deaggregator also sets the Router Alert.
                                          ^
It should say:
                                                 [...].  The
|  Deaggregator also sets the Router Alert bit.
                                          ^^^^^

(3)  Section 4.5 -- typo / spurious word

The second paragraph of section 4.5, on mid-page 12, says:

                                                            [...].  This
   includes performing admission control for the segment downstream of
   the Deaggregator and forwarding the E2E Resv message to the PHOP
|  signaled earlier in the E2E Path message and which identifies the
   Aggregator.  [...]
                                           ^^^^^
It should say:
                                                            [...].  This
   includes performing admission control for the segment downstream of
   the Deaggregator and forwarding the E2E Resv message to the PHOP
|  signaled earlier in the E2E Path message which identifies the
   Aggregator.  [...]
                                           ^

(4)  Section 4.6 -- yet another word omission

On page 14, the last sentence of Section 4.6 says:

                                           [...].  The Deaggregator also
|  sets the Router Alert.
                        ^
It should say:
                                           [...].  The Deaggregator also
|  sets the Router Alert bit.
                        ^^^^^

(5)  Section 4.9 --  missing articles

Within Section 4.9, the last footnote on page 15 says:

     (4)  Aggregator selects final TE tunnel, checks that there is
          sufficient bandwidth on TE tunnel, and forwards E2E Resv to
          PHOP.  If final tunnel is different from tunnel tentatively
          selected, the Aggregator re-sends an E2E Path with an updated
          IF_ID RSVP_HOP and possibly an updated ADSPEC.

It should say:

     (4)  Aggregator selects final TE tunnel, checks that there is
|         sufficient bandwidth on the TE tunnel, and forwards E2E Resv
|         to the PHOP.  If the final tunnel is different from the tunnel
          tentatively selected, the Aggregator re-sends an E2E Path with
          an updated IF_ID RSVP_HOP and possibly an updated ADSPEC.


(6)  Section 6 -- word omissions, and punctuation

The text in the numbered items in Section 6 consists of full
sentences starting with a capital letter.  Therefore all these
paragraphs should terminate in a full-stop.  Also, the word
'tuple' is missing twice.  Hence:

The RFC says (on page 16):

      (1)  The E2E RSVP reservation is a per-flow reservation where the
|          flow is characterized by the usual 5-tuple
                                                     ^
      (2)  The E2E reservation is an aggregate reservation for multiple
           flows as described in [RSVP-AGG] or [RSVP-GEN-AGG] where the
           set of flows is characterized by the <source address,
|          destination address, DSCP>
                                     ^
      (3)  The E2E reservation is a reservation for an IPsec protected
           flow.  For example, where the flow is characterized by the
|          <source address, destination address, SPI> as described in
           [RSVP-IPSEC].
                                                     ^
It should say:

      (1)  The E2E RSVP reservation is a per-flow reservation where the
|          flow is characterized by the usual 5-tuple.
                                                     ^
      (2)  The E2E reservation is an aggregate reservation for multiple
           flows as described in [RSVP-AGG] or [RSVP-GEN-AGG] where the
           set of flows is characterized by the <source address,
|          destination address, DSCP> tuple.
                                     ^^^^^^^
      (3)  The E2E reservation is a reservation for an IPsec protected
           flow.  For example, where the flow is characterized by the
|          <source address, destination address, SPI> tuple as described
           in [RSVP-IPSEC].
                                                     ^^^^^^^

(7)  Section 8 -- typos

(7a)

The 7th text line of Section 18, on mid-page 18, says:

|  The mechanisms protect [...]
      ^
It should say:

|  These mechanisms protect [...]
      ^^^

(7b)

The 4th paragraph on page 19 says:

   Section 5 of [RSVP-AGG] also discusses a security issue specific to
   RSVP aggregation related to the necessary modification of the IP
|  Protocol number in RSVP E2E Path messages that traverses the
   aggregation region.  [...]
                                                          ^^
It should say:

Hello,
quite a while ago, I had studied RFC 4230 (RSVP Security Properties)
authored by you, but I did not find the time to submit my comments
to you.  The recent publication of documents referencing your RFC
has pushed me back to resume working on my marginal notes.

Hereby, I would like to submit a few comments, pointing out the
issues I found with the RFC text, and supplying material to make
notice of for eventual future/derived work, and/or for an appropriate
RFC Errata Note.

The items below are presented in RFC textual order.
I use change bars ('|' in column 1) and occasionally
up/down pointing marker lines ('^^^'/'vvv') to emphasize
the location of textual issues and/or proposed corrections.
Modified text has been re-adjusted to match RFC formatting
rules, where appropriate.


(1)  Section 3.1 -- word omission

On mid-page 7, Section 3.1 of RFC 4230 says:

   o  Keyed Message Digest:

       The Keyed Message Digest is a security mechanism built into RSVP
|      that used to provide integrity protection of a signaling message
       (including its sequence number).  [...]

It should say:

   o  Keyed Message Digest:

       The Keyed Message Digest is a security mechanism built into RSVP
|      that is used to provide integrity protection of a signaling
       message (including its sequence number).  Prior


(2)  Section 3.2  -- mis-specification

On top of page 8, Section 3.2 says:

       vvvvvvv
   The sending system needs to maintain the following attributes in such
   a security association [1]:

      [...]

|     o  Latest sequence number (received with this key identifier)
                                 ^^^^^^^^

I strongly suspect that this is perhaps a copy&paste error from
subsequent lines dealing with the receiving system, and that the
RFC should say, instead ot the last line quoted above:

|     o  Latest sequence number (sent with this key identifier)
                                 ^^^^

(3)  Section 3.4 -- mismatch between text and figure

The RFC text at the bottom of page 9 says:

        [...].  The RSVP INTEGRITY object (outer object) covers the
   entire RSVP message, whereas the POLICY_DATA INTEGRITY object only
   covers objects within the POLICY_DATA element.

Nevertheless, the subsequent Figure 1 (on top of page 10)
does *not* depict this security relevant object at all.

Has there something been fost from Figure 1 ?


(4)  Section 3.4 -- word omissions

In the first paragraph on page 11, Section 3.4 says:

                                             [...].  If user identity
|        confidentiality is provided, then the policy locator has to be
         encrypted with the public key of the recipient.  How to obtain
         this public key is not described in the document.  This detail
         may be specified in a concrete architecture in which RSVP is
         used.

It should say:
                           vvvvvvv
                                             [...].  If user identity
|        confidentiality is to be provided, then the policy locator has
         to be encrypted with the public key of the recipient.  How to
         obtain this public key is not described in the document.  This
         detail may be specified in a concrete architecture in which
         RSVP is used.

Rationale: Better balance the two parts of the tagged sentence!


(5)  Section 4.3 -- word omission

Within Section 4.3, near the bottom of page 27, the first paragraph
under the headline
    (6) Performance
says:
                                                             v
|                                       [...].  Otherwise, it difficult
       to say which identifier is used to index the security
       association.

It should say:
                                                             vvv
|                                       [...].  Otherwise, it is
       difficult to say which identifier is used to index the security
       association.


(6)  Section 5.4 -- spurious blank line

On top of page 36, the text in the last bullet, (3), of Section 5.4
contains a spurious blank line, perhaps a page reformating artifact.
The RFC says:

   (3) It is assumed that SPIs do not change during the lifetime of the
       established QoS reservation.  If a new IPsec SA is created, then
|
       a new SPI is allocated for the security association.  [...]

It should say:

   (3) It is assumed that SPIs do not change during the lifetime of the
       established QoS reservation.  If a new IPsec SA is created, then
       a new SPI is allocated for the security association.  [...]


(7)  Section 5.6 -- a typo and a word omission

Within Section 5.6, the second paragraph on page 37 says:

                              v
|  If an RSVP message can taket more than one possible path, then the
   IPsec engine will experience difficulties protecting the message.
   Even if the RSVP daemon installs a traffic selector with the
   destination IP address, still, no distinguishing element allows
   selection of the correct security association for one of the possible
|  RSVP nodes along the path.  Even if it possible to apply IPsec
   protection (in tunnel mode) for RSVP signaling messages by
   incorporating some additional information, there is still the
   possibility that the tunneled messages do not recognize a path change
   in a non-RSVP router.  [...]

It should say:

|  If an RSVP message can take more than one possible path, then the
   IPsec engine will experience difficulties protecting the message.
   Even if the RSVP daemon installs a traffic selector with the
   destination IP address, still, no distinguishing element allows
   selection of the correct security association for one of the possible
|  RSVP nodes along the path.  Even if it is possible to apply IPsec
   protection (in tunnel mode) for RSVP signaling messages by
   incorporating some additional information, there is still the
   possibility that the tunneled messages do not recognize a path change
   in a non-RSVP router.  [...]


(8)  Section 5.7 -- spurious blank line

Similar as noted in item (6) above, there is a spurious blank line
in the first paragraph of Section 5.7.
On top of page 38, the RFC says:

   mechanism, but authentication might, in many cases, be insufficient
   for authorization.  The communication procedures defined for policy
|
   objects [42] can be improved to support the more efficient per-
   channel financial settlement model by avoiding policy handling
   between inter-domain networks at a signaling message granularity.
   [...]

It should say:

   mechanism, but authentication might, in many cases, be insufficient
   for authorization.  The communication procedures defined for policy
   objects [42] can be improved to support the more efficient per-
   channel financial settlement model by avoiding policy handling
   between inter-domain networks at a signaling message granularity.
   [...]


(9)  Section 9.2 -- typo/punctuation

Within Section 9.2, the first entry on top of page 42 says:

   [21]  Dobbertin, H., Bosselaers, A., and B. Preneel, "RIPEMD-160: A
|        strengthened version of RIPEMD in Fast Software Encryption",
         LNCS vol. 1039, pp. 71-82, 1996.

It should say:

   [21]  Dobbertin, H., Bosselaers, A., and B. Preneel, "RIPEMD-160: A
|        strengthened version of RIPEMD", in: Fast Software Encryption,
         LNCS vol. 1039, pp. 71-82, 1996.


Please comment and decide how to proceed.
If you want (some of) these issues be documented,
preferrably you should submit an Author's Errata Note to the
RFC Editor's RFC Errata web pages, making freely use of the
material supplied above.

Kind regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,
after studying the recently published RFC 4842 (CEP)
authored/edited by you, I would like to submit a few comments,
pointing out some issues I found with the RFC text, and supplying
material for an appropriate RFC Errata Note.

The items below are presented in RFC textual order.
I use change bars ('|' in column 1) and occasionally
up/down pointing marker lines ('^^^'/'vvv') to emphasize
the location of textual issues and/or proposed corrections.
Modified text has been re-adjusted to match RFC formatting
rules, where appropriate.


(0)  Title of the RFC <--> Scope / applicability (Section 2)

The second paragraph of Section 2 says:

   This document provides encapsulation formats and semantics for
|  emulating SONET/SDH circuits and services over MPLS packet-switched
   networks (PSNs).  [...]
                                                  ^^^^

Up to now, pseudowire encapsulations (and signaling protocol elements)
have been defined for MPLS and L2TPv3 in the data plane.

Previous PWE3 documents had developed a clear language for their scope,
saying (omitting the canonical expansion of acronyms),
   "... over MPLS [Networks]",
   "... over L2TPv3",           or
   "... over Packet [Networks]" iff applicable to MPLS *and* L2TPv3.

Confusingly and unfortunately, the title of RFC 4842 breaks that
clear naming scheme.


(1)  Section 4 -- acronym expansion

On page 5, Section 4 of RFC 4842 contains the lines:

                           vvvv
|  STM-n  Synchronous Transport Module-n (SDH)
   STS-n  Synchronous Transport Signal-n (SONET)

I'm getting confused.
>From most publicly available sources, I've been accustomed to expect:

                           vvv
|  STM-n  Synchronous Transfer Module-n (SDH)
   STS-n  Synchronous Transport Signal-n (SONET)

So, what's true?  Please check.


(2)  Section 5.2 -- missing article

The first paragraph of Section 5.2, near the bottom of page 7, says:
                                           v
|  The CEP header supports both a basic and extended mode.  The Basic
   CEP header provides the minimum functionality necessary to accurately
   emulate a SONET/SDH circuit over a PSN.  [...]

It should say:
                                           vvvv
|  The CEP header supports both a basic and an extended mode.  The Basic
   CEP header provides the minimum functionality necessary to accurately
   emulate a SONET/SDH circuit over a PSN.  [...]


(3)  Section 5.3

(3a)  -- missing article

In the lower half of page 10, Section 5.3 contains the explanation:

   Sequence Number [0:15]:  The packet sequence number MUST continuously
      cycle from 0 to 0xFFFF.  It is generated and processed in
      accordance with the rules established in [RTP].  The CEP receiver
      MUST sequence packets according to the Sequence Number field of
|     the CEP header and MAY verify correct sequencing using RTP
      Sequence Number field.
                                                            ^
It should say:

   Sequence Number [0:15]:  The packet sequence number MUST continuously
      cycle from 0 to 0xFFFF.  It is generated and processed in
      accordance with the rules established in [RTP].  The CEP receiver
      MUST sequence packets according to the Sequence Number field of
|     the CEP header and MAY verify correct sequencing using the RTP
      Sequence Number field.
                                                            ^^^^^

(3b)  -- surprising timestamp clock frequency

The next bullet on page 10 says:

   Timestamp [0:31]:  Timestamp values are used in accordance with the
      rules established in [RTP].  Frequency of the clock used for
|     generating timestamps MUST be 19.44 MHz based on a local
      reference.
                                    ^^^^^^^^^

This frequency value is surprising (for me).
I could not derive any immediate relationship to wellknown SONET/SDH
bit or frame rates, etc. -- cf. Tables 4 & 5 in Appendix A of the RFC.
If the specified value is correct, please give me a hint on its origin;
otherwise, please have it corrected in an RFC Errata Note.


(4)  Section 10.1 -- missing article

Within Section 10.1, in the second paragraph on page 20, the RFC says:
                                  v
|  UAS-CEP SHALL be declared after configurable number of consecutive
   SES-CEP, and cleared after a configurable number of consecutive
   seconds without SES-CEP.  Default value for each is 10 seconds.

It should say:
                                  vvv
|  UAS-CEP SHALL be declared after a configurable number of consecutive
   SES-CEP, and cleared after a configurable number of consecutive
   seconds without SES-CEP.  Default value for each is 10 seconds.


(5)  Section 11.2.1.1 -- confusing bit field specifications

In Section 11.2.1.1, Figure 7 and the long paragraph extending from
the bottom of page 23 to the top of page 24 say:

   The STS-1 EBM has the following format:

       0                   1                   2
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |  VTG7 |  VTG6 |  VTG5 |  VTG4 |  VTG3 |  VTG2 |  VTG1 |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

          Figure 7: Equipped Bit Mask (EBM) for Fractional STS-1

   The 28 bits of the EBM are divided into groups of 4 bits, each
   corresponding to a different VTG within the STS container.  All 4
   bits are used to indicate whether VT1.5 (T1) tributaries are carried
|  within a VTG.  The first 3 bits read from right to left are used to
   indicate whether VT2 (E1) tributaries are carried within a VTG.  The
|  first 2 bits are used to indicate whether VT3 (DS1C) tributaries are
|  carried within a VTG.  The rightmost bit is used to indicate whether
   a VT6 (DS2) is carried within the VTG.  The VTs within the VTG are
   numbered from right to left, starting from the first VT as the first
   bit on the right.  For example, the EBM of a fully occupied STS-1
<< page break >>>
   with VT1.5 tributaries is all ones, while that of an STS-1 fully
   occupied with VT2 (E1) tributaries has the binary value
|  0111011101110111011101110111.

Ooops!

a)
If you have a numbered bit field, e.g., the VTG7 field:

       0 1 2 3 4 5
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-
      |  VTG7 |  ...
      +-+-+-+-+-+-

and denote the binary representation of its value accordingly:
         <vtg7> = < b0, b1, b2, b3 >,
then "The *first* 3 bits read from right to left", apparently
specifies the number with the (bit-reversed) binary representation
                  < b2, b1, b0 > .

That does not correspond to the final example given, and it is not
really compatible with the last sentence before the page break.

Similarly, "the first 2 bits" used for VT3 / DS1C would be
  < b0, b1 >  -- or should it be (again, bit-revered)  < b1, b0 >  ??

Finally, "the rightmost bit" is used for VT6 / DS2, i.e.  < b3 > .

That seems fuzzy, at best.

Assuming that the example is correct, I strongly suspect that the
'active' bit groups are intended to be right justified in the 4-bit
groups, in any case, und that thus text above in fact should say:

   The 28 bits of the EBM are divided into groups of 4 bits, each
   corresponding to a different VTG within the STS container.  All 4
   bits are used to indicate whether VT1.5 (T1) tributaries are carried
|  within a VTG.  The 3 rightmost bits in a bit group are used to
|  indicate whether VT2 (E1) tributaries are carried within a VTG.
|  The 2 rightmost bits in a bit group are used to indicate whether
|  VT3 (DS1C) tributaries are carried within a VTG.  The rightmost bit
   is used to indicate whether a VT6 (DS2) is carried within the VTG.
   The VTs within the VTG are numbered from right to left, starting from
   the first VT as the first bit on the right.  [...]

b)
Further confusion arises from the fact that the above specification
overloads the field in a four-fold way but does not give any hint
as to how this overloading is encoded / disambiguated.

I've scratched my head for quite a time, looking for the appropriate
hooks to properly decode the field.
Much later in the text, it eventually turns out that this information
must be signalled out-of-band.

For clarity and precision, this fact should have been stated clearly
within Section 11.2.1.1.


(6)  Section 11.2.1.2

There's a mismatch in the notation between the formula given in
Section 11.2.1.2, on mid-page 24, and the subsequent explanations.
The RFC says:
                                                           vvv
|     B3[i]'(t) = B3[i](t-1) || B3[i]'(t-1) || B3[i](t) || B*3[i](t-1)

|     Where:

         B3[i]   = the existing B3[i] value in the incoming signal
         B3[i]'  = the new (compensated) B3[i] value
|        B3*[i]  = the B3[i] value of the unequipped VTs in the
                   incoming signal
         ||  =  exclusive OR operator
         t   =  the time of the current frame
         t-1 =  the time of the previous frame

IMHO, the notation 'B3*[i]' , as explained is the proper notation,
and the  'B*3'  in the formula should be changed accordingly.
Furthermore, the second line should be 'editorially reworked' for
proper indentation (as the text above and below) and capitalization.

Hence, the RFC should say:
                                                           vvv
|     B3[i]'(t) = B3[i](t-1) || B3[i]'(t-1) || B3[i](t) || B3*[i](t-1)

|   where:

         B3[i]   = the existing B3[i] value in the incoming signal
         B3[i]'  = the new (compensated) B3[i] value
         B3*[i]  = the B3[i] value of the unequipped VTs in the
                   incoming signal
         ||  =  exclusive OR operator
         t   =  the time of the current frame
         t-1 =  the time of the previous frame


(7)  Section 11.2.2.1 -- missing article

The last paragraph of Section 11.2.2.1, at the bottom of page 25,
says:

   A T3 is encapsulated asynchronously into a VC-3 container as
|  described in Section 10.1.2.1 of [G.707].  VC-3 container has only 85
   data columns, which is identical to the STS-1 container with the two
   fixed stuff columns 30 and 59 removed.  Other than that, the mapping
   is identical.

It should say:
                                              vv
   A T3 is encapsulated asynchronously into a VC-3 container as
|  described in Section 10.1.2.1 of [G.707].  A VC-3 container has only
   85 data columns, which is identical to the STS-1 container with the
   two fixed stuff columns 30 and 59 removed.  Other than that, the
   mapping is identical.


(8)  Section 11.2.3.1 -- onother missing article

The third paragraph of Section 11.2.3.1, near the bottom of page 27,
says:
                                                               v
|  [...].  This is the equivalent of multiplexing 7 VTGs within STS-1
   container in SONET terminology, except for the location of the fixed
   columns.

It should say:
                                                               vvvv
|  [...].  This is the equivalent of multiplexing 7 VTGs within an STS-1
   container in SONET terminology, except for the location of the fixed
   columns.


(9)  Section 11.2.3.2

(9a)  -- bad term / extraneous word

The first paragraph of Section 11.2.3.2, on top of page 28, says:

   The fractional VC-4 CEP header uses the VC-4 CEP header defined in
   this document.  Optionally, an additional 12-byte header extension
|  word is added.
   ^^^^^
It should say:

   The fractional VC-4 CEP header uses the VC-4 CEP header defined in
   this document.  Optionally, an additional 12-byte header extension
|  is added.

Rationale:  There are no such "12-byte words", AFAICS.

(9b)  -- confusing bit field specifications, again

Similar issues as explained in item (5) above also hold for the (long)
second paragraph below Figure 10, on mid-page 29.
Again, I strongly suspect that the text,

      [...].  All 4 bits are used to indicate whether VC-11 (T1)
|  tributaries are carried within a TUG-2.  The first 3 bits read right
|  to left are used to indicate whether VC-12 (E1) tributaries are
|  carried within a TUG-2.  The first bit is used to indicate that a
   VC-2 is carried within a TUG-2.  The VCs within the TUG-2 are
   numbered from right to left, starting from the first VC as the first
   bit on the right.  For example, [...]

in fact should say:

      [...].  All 4 bits are used to indicate whether VC-11 (T1)
|  tributaries are carried within a TUG-2.  The rightmost 3 bits are
   used to indicate whether VC-12 (E1) tributaries are carried within a

   within a TUG-2.  The VCs within the TUG-2 are numbered from right to
   left, starting from the first VC as the first bit on the right.  For
   example, [...]

(9c)  -- typo / singular/plural mismatch

The last paragraph of Section 11.2.3.2, near the bottom of page 29,
says:
                                     vv
|           [...].  The A bit indicate the reason for removal of the
   entire TUG-3 columns.  [...]

It should say:
                                     vvv
|           [...].  The A bit indicates the reason for removal of the
   entire TUG-3 columns.  [...]


(10)  Section 12  -- item (0) and its bad consequences

In Section 12, we unfortunately return to the issue explained in
item (0) above.

Within Section 12, the first paragraph on page 31 says:

   The PW Type field in PWid Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC) and PW
|  generalized ID FEC elements MUST be set to SONET/SDH Circuit
|  Emulation over Packet (CEP) [PWE3-IANA].

In RFC 4446 [PWE3-IANA], on page 3, I find *two* assignments:

   PW type Description                                      Reference
   ===================================================================
   0x0008  SONET/SDH Circuit Emulation Service Over MPLS    [CEP]
   0x0010  SONET/SDH Circuit Emulation over Packet          [CEP]

Hence, apparently Section 12 refers to PW type 0x0010.

Because there is an independent 'PW type' namespace for L2TPv3 and
RFC 4446 was MPLS-specific (although its title didn't say so!),
it could be concluded from the above that PW type 0x0010 was
intended for use over MPLS *and* L2TPv3, with a corresponding
assignment for L2TPv3 to be performed in another document, whereas
PW type 0x0008 apparently was reserved for an MPLS specific CEP
solution, and both were expected to be specified in the same document.

Since RFC 4842 is MPLS-only, it could be expected that it would
make use of that MPLS-specific PW type, 0x0008, not of 0x0010 !
Therefore, the above quoted text in Section 12 comes to great
surprise!

The IANA registry (today) still lists theses two lines as above,
where [CEP] is:

  [CEP]    "SONET/SDH Circuit Emulation Service Over Packet (CEP)",
           draft-ietf-pwe3-sonet-11.txt (work in progress)

Therefore:  What's the matter here ?

Apparently, RFC 4842 *is* the successor ot that I-D.

Has PW type 0x0008 been abandoned ?
Or is Section 12 wrong, and it should refer to PW type 0x0008 ?

In former case, the IANA registry should be updated, deprecating and
perhaps permanently reserving 0x0008, and 0x0010 should be renamed
to reflect its use (and all that should have been noted in Section 15
of RFC 4842!), e.g.:

   PW type Description                                      Reference
   ===================================================================
   0x0008  - deprecated - / -reserved -                     [IESG]
   0x0010  SONET/SDH Circuit Emulation over MPLS            [RFC4842]


(11)  Section 15 -- omissions

As explained in the preceding item, IANA has not properly updated
the pwe3-parameters registry upon publication od RFC 4842.

This is certainly due to missing instructions in Section 15,
which merely states (on page 35):

   IANA considerations for pseudowires are covered in [PWE3-IANA].  CEP
   does not introduce additional requirements from IANA.

This section should have been instructed to link one of the above
mentioned PW types to RFC 4842, and perform the intended disposition
with the other one.

Whatever the plans currently are, the IANA registry should be
updated accordingly and as soon as possible, to reduce the confusion.


(12)  Appendix A -- incomplete information

On mid-page 36, just below Table 4, Appendix A says:

   [...]
   A number of STS-1s may also be linked together to form a super-rate
|  signal with only one SPE.  The optical super-rate signal is denoted
   as OC-Nc, which has a higher payload capacity than OC-N.

For completeness and clarity, the super-rate signal mentioned should
be named.  According to the layman's guess (please correct if I am
wrong!), the RFC should say:

   [...]
   A number of STS-1s may also be linked together to form a super-rate
|  signal denoted STS-Nc, with only one SPE.  The optical super-rate
   signal is denoted as OC-Nc, which has a higher payload capacity than
   OC-N.



Please comment.

At least items (6) and (9) should be addressed by an Errata Note.
Items (10) and (11) need action anyway.
I leave it to your decision which other items should be included
in an Errata Note as well; for some items, it surely depends on
the 'far end' diagnostic results (from my perspective) ...

Preferrably, you should submit an Author's Errata Note to the
RFC Editor's RFC Errata web pages, making freely use of the
material supplied above.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

RFC 3032 says, section 2.3.2:

      Since an ICMP message is never sent as a result of receiving an ICMP
      message,

But this is not what RFC 1122 says in section 3.2.2 :

        An ICMP error message MUST NOT be sent as the result of
         receiving:

         *    an ICMP error message, or

("error message", not just "message")

Counter-example: when I ping a host, an ICMP echo-reply message is
generated as the result of my echo-request message. I believe RFC 3032
is wrong here, although it does not seem to have practical
consequences.

(RFC 4379 is also an useful reading here)

Hi,

While I appreciate the work and dedication going into RFC 4824, and
appreciated reading it :-), I was disappointed when I realized that
the current specification is flawed, and will not be able to lead to
guaranteed interoperable implementations without further
specification :-(


Error:
------
  
The illustrated SFS for symbol 'Y', signifying control signal 'RTT',
is depicted as identical with symbol 'M', which signals nibble value
0x0C.  This means that some implementations may break off receipt with
an error on receiving 0x0C and interpreting it as RTT, while others
may see RTT and interpret it as a spurious 0x0C, and ignore it.

References [JCroft, Wikipedia] gives a different way of signalling 'Y',
which does not coincide with any of the other symbols.  This
discrepancy between the current specification and the references may
also result in both implementation and execution differences, as some
interfaces may already have signal 'Y' hard-coded according to [JCroft]
or [Wikipedia], which will result in transmission of an SFS which will
not be understood by an interface that follows the current specification
strictly.

Accordingly, errata should be issued with the following change, which
matches [JCroft] and [Wikipedia]:

OLD::
                   SFS        0__     0__

                              Y       Z

                   IP-SFS    RTT    unused

                   -----------------------------------------   


Nits:
-----

In Section 3. reference is made to sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2, which
don't exist.  I believe you meant to refer to 3.3 and 3.4 respectively:


OLD::
   IP-SFS adapts the standard SFSS to encode an alphabet of 16 signals
   (flag patterns) to represent data values 0-15 (Section 3.2.1) and 9
   signals to represent control functions (Section 3.2.2).  With 16 data
   signals, IP-SFS transmission is based upon 4-bit nibbles, two per
   octet.  Each of the signal patterns defined in Section 3.2 is called
   an SFS.

NEW::
   IP-SFS adapts the standard SFSS to encode an alphabet of 16 signals
   (flag patterns) to represent data values 0-15 (Section 3.3) and 9
   signals to represent control functions (Section 3.4).  With 16 data
   signals, IP-SFS transmission is based upon 4-bit nibbles, two per
   octet.  Each of the signal patterns defined in Section 3.2 is called
   an SFS.

Hello,
after studying the recently published RFC 4876 authored by you,
I would like to submit a few comments, pointing out some issues
I found with the RFC text, and supplying material for an
appropriate RFC Errata Note.

The items below are presented in RFC textual order.
I use change bars ('|' in column 1) and occasionally
up/down pointing marker lines ('^^^'/'vvv') to emphasize
the location of textual issues and/or proposed corrections.
Modified text has been re-adjusted to match RFC formatting
rules, where appropriate.


(1)  Section 3.1 -- word omission in DESC

On page 9, the RFC says:

   ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.11.1.3.1.1.15 NAME 'serviceAuthenticationMethod'
|    DESC 'Specifies types authentication methods either
     used, required, or supported by a particular service'
     EQUALITY caseIgnoreMatch
     SUBSTR caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch
     SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15 )

It should say:

   ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.11.1.3.1.1.15 NAME 'serviceAuthenticationMethod'
|    DESC 'Specifies types of authentication methods either
     used, required, or supported by a particular service'
     EQUALITY caseIgnoreMatch
     SUBSTR caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch
     SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15 )


(2)  Section 4.6 -- typo/grammar

On page 19, just above the headline 'Example:', the RFC says:

|        The authors' belief that the user community is more familiar
         with the search filter syntax described by RFC 4515 than with
         that described by the enhancedSearchGuide syntax.

It should say either:

|        The authors' belief is that the user community is more familiar
         with the search filter syntax described by RFC 4515 than with
         that described by the enhancedSearchGuide syntax.

or, even simpler:

|        The authors believe that the user community is more familiar
         with the search filter syntax described by RFC 4515 than with
         that described by the enhancedSearchGuide syntax.


(3)  Section 4.13 -- missing articles

On page 26, the RFC says:

   Example:

      Suppose a DUA is acting on behalf of an email service.  By default
      the "email" service uses the "mail", "cn", and "sn" attributes to
|     discover mail addresses in entries created using inetOrgPerson
      object class [RFC2789].  However, the email service has been
|     deployed in an environment that uses entries created using
      "employee" object class.  [...]

It should perhaps better say:

      Suppose a DUA is acting on behalf of an email service.  By default
      the "email" service uses the "mail", "cn", and "sn" attributes to
|     discover mail addresses in entries created using the inetOrgPerson
      object class [RFC2789].  However, the email service has been
|     deployed in an environment that uses entries created using the
      "employee" object class.  [...]


(4)  Appendix A, Example 4

I strongly suspect that the escaping/unescaping within Example 4
has been garbled.
On page 36, the RFC says:

   Example 4:

|  serviceSearchDescriptor: email:ou=\\mar\\\\keting,\\"?base
   attributeMap: email:cn=name

|  base: ou=\\mar\\keting,"
   scope: base
   filter (&(objectclass=inetOrgPerson)(name~=Jane Hernandez))

Issues:
-  unescaping of `\\mar` should give `\mar` , not `\\mar`
-  to obtain `ing,"` , the escaped version should be `ing,\"'
(This presentation is biased to attribute one error each to the
 two tagged lines - you might have intended another version.)


(5)  Appendix A, Example 6

On page 37, the RFC says:

   Example 6:

   serviceSearchDescriptor: email:??(&(objectclass=person)
|                                   (ou=Org1 \\\\(temporary\\\\)))

   base: o=airius.com
   scope: sub
|  filter: (&((&(objectclass=person)(ou=Org1 \\(Temporary\\)))
             (cn~=Jane Henderson)))

There's a spelling mismatch in capitalization:
   'temporary'   <-->  'Temporary'



Please check and comment.

In particular, items (4) and (5) should be resolved and addressed
by an Errata Note.  I leave it to your decision which of the other
items should be included there as well.

Preferrably, you should submit an Author's Errata Note to the
RFC Editor's RFC Errata web pages, making freely use of the
material supplied above.  But if you like, I can formally
submit an Errata Note on my own, with your consent.

Best regards,
  Alfred HÎnes.

Hello,

I think I found another errata in RFC2812 concerning the ABNF for =
shortnames. RFC2812 defines shortnames as


shortname  =3D  ( letter / digit ) *( letter / digit / "-" )
              *( letter / digit )
              ; as specified in RFC 1123 [HNAME]

>From RFC 1123:

   2.1  Host Names and Numbers

      The syntax of a legal Internet host name was specified in RFC-952
      [DNS:4].  One aspect of host name syntax is hereby changed: the
      restriction on the first character is relaxed to allow either a
      letter or a digit.  Host software MUST support this more liberal
      syntax.


In RFC952 the definition of a shortname looks like this

<name>  ::=3D <let>[*[<let-or-digit-or-hyphen>]<let-or-digit>]

So in my oppinion the shortname definition in RFC2812 should be

shortname  =3D  ( letter / digit ) [ *( letter / digit / "-" ) ( letter =
/ digit ) ]


Greetings

On page 9 of RFC3080 [BEEP].

Last paragraph states:
   The answer number ("ansno") must be a non-negative integer (in the
   range 0..4294967295) and must have a different value than all other
   answers in progress for the message being replied to.

However, on page 8:
   channel    = 0..2147483647
   msgno      = 0..2147483647
   more       = "." / "*"
   seqno      = 0..4294967295
   size       = 0..2147483647
   ansno      = 0..2147483647

If page 8 is correct, page then 9 needs to be changed to:

   The answer number ("ansno") must be a non-negative integer (in the
   range 0..2147483647) and must have a different value than all other
   answers in progress for the message being replied to.

Hi.

I belive there is a typo in the second paragraph on page 15 (Section "9.
UAS Behavior".)

=20

The original text is as follows:

If the incoming request contains a Supported header field with a
value 'timer' but does not contain a Session-Expires header, it means
that the UAS is indicating support for timers but is not requesting
one.  The UAS may request a session timer in the 2XX response by
including a Session-Expires header field.  The value MUST NOT be set
to a duration lower than the value in the Min-SE header field in the
request, if it is present.

=20

I believe that in the first sentence, the reference to "...the UAS is
indicating support...." should read "... the UAC is indicating
support..."

=20

Could you please verify this and issue an errata if I'm correct?

=20

Dear RFC Editor,

attached please find an errata note for RFC 4866 ("Enhanced Route
Optimization"), which I kindly ask you to publish.

The errata covers two back-to-back sentences where a "maximum" should
actually be a "minimum".  It also covers two typos.

Thank you,
- Christian

Dear RFC Editor,

I recently found the following errata in RFC 3987.
I have copied the relevant IETF Area Directors as well as my co-author.

1) In section 3.1.,  Mapping of IRIs to URIs, there is a paragraph
   labeled "Syntaxical". This should be corrected to read "Syntactical".
   This was not part of the last draft that served as a base for the
   RFC Editor's work, and I also didn't catch it in AUTH48.
   This is a purely editorial issue.

2) There are a few cases where quoting is wrong, due to the fact that
   the RFC Editor didn't understand the syntax, and I didn't catch
   the change in AUTH48. In all cases, the final semicolon has to be
   inside the double quotes, not outside.

   Section 5.2., Preparation for Comparison:
   "http://example.org/ros&#233"; -> "http://example.org/ros&#233;"
   "http://example.org/ros&#xE9"; -> "http://example.org/ros&#xE9;"
   "http://example.org/ros&#xE9"; -> "http://example.org/ros&#xE9;"

   Section 6.4., Use of UTF-8 for Encoding Original Characters
   "&#xE9"; -> "&#xE9;"
   "http://www.example.org/r%E9sum%E9.xml#r&#xE9;sum&#xE9"; ->
      "http://www.example.org/r%E9sum%E9.xml#r&#xE9;sum&#xE9;"

   This type of error is close to editorial, but could lead to
   serious confusion if not deal with.

If you need to know something more in order to process these errata,
please feel free to ask.

Regards,    Martin.

P.S.: Please note that my email address has changed because
      my affiliation has changed.
