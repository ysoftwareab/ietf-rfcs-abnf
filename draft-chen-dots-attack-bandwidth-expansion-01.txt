                Using attack bandwidth in signal channel
             draft-chen-dots-attack-bandwidth-expansion-01

Abstract

   This document describes a DDoS Mitigation Request parameter used in
   the Signal Channel request, as an expansion of the signal channel for
   mitigating DDoS attack accurately with target-bandwidth.  The
   proposed parameter will help to choose the appropriate mitigator or
   mitigators for mitigation, When An attack occurs that is greater than
   the maximum clean capability, this paramter can decide to be
   blackhole directly or to be drainaged for clean.

1.  Introduction

   Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is a type of resource-consuming
   attack, which exploits a large number of attack resources and uses
   standard protocols to attack target objects.  DDoS attacks consume a
   large amount of target object network resources or server resources
   (including computing power, storage capacity, etc.) of the target
   object, so that the target object cannot provide network services
   normally.  At present, DDoS attack is one of the most powerful and
   indefensible attacks on the Internet, and due to the extensive use of
   mobile devices and IoT devices in recent years, it is easier for DDoS
   attackers to attack with real attack sources (broilers).

   Volume based distributed denial-of-service attack bring huge amount
   of attack traffic on the link, and the peaks keep hitting new highs,
   the economic loss that causes is bigger also.  For the service
   providers to immediately protect their network services from DDoS
   attacks, DDoS mitigation needs to be automated.

   DDoS Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) is a protocol to standardize real-
   time signaling, threat-handling
   requests[I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel], when attack target is under
   attack, dots client send mitigation request to dots server for help,
   If the mitigation request contains enough messages of the attack,
   then the mitigator can respond very effectively.

Internet-Draft            dots attack bandwidth               March 2019


   Currently, there are two selections to deal with ddos attacks on the
   link, one is blackhole, the other is flow clean.  Blackhole means
   that all packets send to the attack target will be discarded by
   routers on the path, this way can instantly reduce the link load,
   Other managed services on this link will not be affected, but for the
   attack target all the normal business messages will be severely
   damaged, for example, if the attack target provide News and
   information services and under ddos attack, all users will be
   inaccessible if the attack target choose blackhole for mitigation.
   Flow clean means that all the flow will be drainaged by routers to
   clean center, the clean center will recognize the attack flow from
   normal business traffic, then reinjects normal business traffic to
   network link by routers after the operation of attack flow discard,
   in this way the attack target will not be effected.

   Currently, mitigator usually has the ability to cluster cleaning
   equipment and manage a large number of cleaning equipment.
   Increasing the attack-bandwidth is also very convenient for the
   scheduling of cleaning equipment, so it can match to find the most
   suitable cleaning equipment and improve the usage rate of cleaning
   equipment.  Mitigator can also be companies who provide flow cleaning
   service, they rent the bandwidth from Upstream Service Provider
   themselves, so they are very careful with their link bandwidth usage.
   Another scenario is that the link of attack warning is inconsistent
   with the link of actual traffic drainage, so increasing the parameter
   of attack-bandwidth is conducive to selecting the BGP path of
   drainage.

   This document describes attack-bandwidth, as a parameter expansion
   used in the mitigation request. attack-bandwidth means the amount of
   traffic under attack, this parameter can effectively reflect the
   degree of an attack, it will be more convenient for mitigator to
   dispose attack flow when carry target-bandwidth in the mitigation
   request.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119]

   The readers should be familiar with the terms defined in
   [I-D.ietf-dots-requirements] [I-D.ietf-dots-use-cases]

   The terminology related to YANG data modules is defined in [RFC7950]

   In addition, this document uses the terms defined below:

Internet-Draft            dots attack bandwidth               March 2019


   Attack-bandwidth:  the amount of traffic under attack, it is usually
      expressed numerically.

   Flow clean:  one selection of Attack traffic deposition, the
      operation contains recognize, discard and reinage.

3.  Mitigation Use Case

3.1.  directly discard attack flow

   when attack target is under attack, it has to make corresponding
   disposal, there are two options for disposal, one is blackhole
   directly, in this way all the attack flow will be discarded by router
   upper path of attack target, this means that the attack target will
   not receive any traffic during the attack, all the traffic forwards
   attack target will be discarded, this has a huge impact on the work
   environment, especially the host that provide external service.

   The other way of the disposition is to drainage all the traffic flow
   to clean center from router, then the clean center will use pattern
   matching or any other method to find out the attack traffic flow to
   discard, finally, clean center reinage the normal business traffic
   back to attack target by upper router, the whole process above is
   defined as flow clean(Figure 1).


               attack flow +--------+                   +--------+
               ----------->| router |------------------>| clean  |
                 1         +--------+         2         | center |
                            |                           +--------+
                          3 |                               |
                            |       +--------+              |
                            +------>| attack |<-------------+
                                    | target |
                                    +--------+


               Figure 1: diagram of DDoS Mitigation usecase

   Generally, the bandwidth of the link 1 must be larger than link 2 and
   link 3, and the clean ability of clean center limited to hardware
   resources.  An example of link situation is as below(Figure 2):

Internet-Draft            dots attack bandwidth               March 2019


            +------------+------------+
            |   figure   | bandwidth/ |
            |   tag      | capability |
            +------------+------------+
            |  link 1    | 100Gb      |
            |  link 2    | 50Gb       |
            |  link 3    | 10Gb       |
            |clean center| 80Gb       |
            +------------+------------+


                  Figure 2: an example of link bandwidth

   The Figure2 is a scenario of the link bandwidth, when a ddos attack
   is ongoing, if the link 1 bandwidth is completely jammed, the best
   way to mitigate the attack is to discard all the attack flow; if the
   amount of the traffic flow is lower than the remainder cleaning
   ability, the most suitable deposition is to drainage all the attack
   flow to clean center.

   Therefore, it is an obvious requirement in the current network
   environment.  In the architecture of DOTS, Dots client send
   mitigation request to dots server, the parameters in the mitigation
   request contains some message of attack target, but there have not
   any messages of attack, if add attack-bandwidth to mitigation request
   as an expansion, it will be more effective and convenient for the
   disposition of mitigator.

3.2.  Optimal device selection

   Mitigator may owns a cleaning device cluster and can manage cleaning
   devices.The capacity of each cleaning equipment is not the same,
   usually each cleaning equipment utilization rate is not the same,
   then the remaining cleaning capacity is not consistent.When the
   attack flow is less than the ability of a cleaning equipment,
   according to the attack-bandwidth can choose a suitable cleaning
   equipment,that is conducive to the utilization of equipment;When the
   attack flow is larger than the cleaning capacity of one cleaning
   device, several cleaning devices can be optimally scheduled according
   to the attack-bandwidth.

3.3.  Optimum path for disposal

   When mitigator is an attack flow cleaning service, they typically
   deployed the mitigator in a distributed way because of the cost of
   bandwidth usage with their own leased operator's link bandwidth, and
   choosing the best traction path was the key to profitability.If the

Internet-Draft            dots attack bandwidth               March 2019


   parameter of attack-bandwidth is carried, then the generation of the
   best drainage path is very meaningful.

   When mitigator is at the upstream service operator level, they might
   have multiple networks, with the attack alert using one network and
   the flow drainage using another, and the link load is not the same,
   then carrying the attack-bandwidth is very beneficial for choosing
   the drainage path, mainly for link load balancing.

4.  Request Mitigation expansion

   When a DOTS client requires mitigation for some reason, the DOTS
   client uses the CoAP PUT method to send a mitigation request to its
   DOTS server(s).  If a DOTS client is entitled to solicit the DOTS
   service, the DOTS server enables mitigation on behalf of the DOTS
   client by communicating the DOTS client's request to a mitigator
   (which may be colocated with the DOTS server) and relaying the
   feedback of the thus-selected mitigator to the requesting DOTS
   client.

   DOTS clients use the PUT method to request mitigation from a DOTS
   server.  During active mitigation, DOTS clients may use PUT requests
   to carry mitigation efficacy updates to the DOTS server.

   The new parameter in the CBOR body (Figure 3) is described below:

      format is numerical form, such as xxGb.  Different attack has
      different attack bandwidth, numerical value directly reflects the
      urgency of the current attack.  Serious attacks are treated with
      blackhole, Other cases use flow cleaning, attack-bandwidth is
      conducive to the selection of disposal mode.
