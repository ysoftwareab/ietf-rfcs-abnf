Abstract 
    
   An Emergency Telecommunications Service (ETS) requires the ability to 
   provide an elevated probability of call completion to an authorized 
   user in times of network congestion (typically, during a crisis). 
   When supported over the Internet Protocol suite, this may be achieved 
   through an admission control solution which supports admission 
   priority capabilities and possibly session preemption capabilities

   (depending on policies and deployed implementations). Admission 
   priority involves setting aside some resources (e.g. bandwidth) out 
   of the engineered capacity limits for the emergency services only, or 
   alternatively involves allowing the emergency sessions to seize 
   additional resources beyond the engineered capacity limits applied to 
   normal calls. 
    
   This document specifies RSVP extensions necessary for supporting such 
   admission priority capabilities.

Specification of Requirements 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 
    
    
1.  Introduction 
    
   [EMERG-RQTS] and [EMERG-TEL] detail requirements for an Emergency 
   Telecommunications Service (ETS), which is an umbrella term 
   identifying those networks and specific services used to support 
   emergency communications. An underlying goal of these documents is to 
   present requirements that elevate the probability of session 
   establishment from an authorized user in times of network congestion 
   (presumably because of a crisis condition). To that end, some of 
   these types of services require that the network be capable of 
   preempting sessions; others do not involve preemption but instead 
   rely on another network mechanism which we refer throughout this 
   document as "admission priority", in order to obtain a high 
   probability of session completion for those. Admission priority 
   involves setting aside some resources (e.g. bandwidth) out of the 
   engineered capacity limits for the emergency services only, or 
   alternatively involves allowing the emergency related sessions to 
   seize additional resources beyond the engineered capacity limits 
   applied to normal calls. 
    
   Note: Below, this document references several examples of IP 
   telephony and its use of "calls", which is one form of the term 
   "sessions" (Video over IP and Instant Messaging being other examples 
   that rely on session establishment).  For the sake of simplicity, we 
   shall use the widely known term "call" for the remainder of this 
   document.

   [EMERG-IMP] describes the call and admission control procedures (at 
   initial call set up, as well as after call establishment through 
   maintenance of a continuing call model of the status of all calls) 
   which allow support of an Emergency Telecommunications Service. 
   [EMERG-IMP] also describes how these call and admission control 
   procedures can be realized using the Resource reSerVation Protocol 
   [RSVP] along with its associated protocol suite and extensions, 
   including those for policy based admission control ([FW-POLICY], 
   [RSVP-POLICY]), for user authentication and authorization ([RSVP-ID]) 
   and for integrity and authentication of RSVP messages ([RSVP-CRYPTO-
   1], [RSVP-CRYPTO-2]). 
    
   Furthermore, [EMERG-IMP] describes how the RSVP Signaled Preemption 
   Priority Policy Element specified in [RSVP-PREEMP] can be used to 
   enforce the call preemption needed by some emergency services. 
    
   This document specifies RSVP extensions, which can be used to enforce 
   the "admission priority" required by an RSVP capable ETS network. In 
   particular this document specifies two new RSVP Policy Elements 
   allowing the admission priority to be conveyed inside RSVP signaling 
   messages so that RSVP nodes can enforce selective bandwidth admission 
   control decision based on the call admission priority. This document 
   also provides three examples of a bandwidth allocation model which 
   can be used by RSVP-routers to enforce such admission priority on 
   every link. 
    
1.1. Changes from previous versions 
       
1.1.1.  Changes from -00 to -01 
    
   The most significant changes are: 
    
      o adding a second RSVP Policy Element that contains the 
      application-level resource priority requirements (for example as 
      communicated in the SIP Resource-Priority Header) for scenarios 
      where priority calls transits through multiple administrative 
      domains. 
       
      o adding description of a third bandwidth allocation model 
      example: the Priority Bypass Model 
       
      o adding discussion on policies for mapping the various bandwidth 
      allocation model over the engineered capacity limits. 
    
    
2.  Overview of RSVP extensions and Operations 
    
   Let us consider the case where a call requiring ETS type service is 
   to be established, and more specifically that the preference to be 
 
 
Le Faucheur, et al.                                           [Page 3] 

                RSVP Extensions for Emergency Services      March 2006 
 
 
   granted to this call is in terms of "admission priority"  (as opposed 
   to preference granted through preemption of existing calls). By 
   "admission priority" we mean allowing that priority call to seize 
   resources from the engineered capacity that have been set-aside and 
   not made available to normal calls, or alternatively by allowing that 
   call to seize additional resources beyond the engineered capacity 
   limits applied to normal calls.  
    
   As described in [EMERG-IMP], the session establishment can be 
   conditioned to resource-based and policy-based admission control 
   achieved via RSVP signaling. In the case where the session control 
   protocol is SIP, the use of RSVP-based admission control by SIP is 
   specified in [SIP-RESOURCE]. 
    
   Devices involved in the session establishment are expected to be 
   aware of the application-level priority requirements of emergency 
   calls. Again considering the case where the session control protocol 
   is SIP, the SIP user agents can be made aware of the resource 
   priority requirements in the case of an emergency call using the 
   Resource-Priority Header mechanism specified in [SIP-PRIORITY]. 
    
   Where, as per our considered case, the application-level priority 
   requirement of the emergency call involves admission priority, the 
   devices involved in the upper-layer session establishment simply need 
   to: 
    
      (1)  map the application-level priority requirements of the 
           emergency call into an RSVP "admission priority" level and 
           convey this information in the relevant RSVP messages used 
           for admission control. The admission priority is encoded 
           inside the new Admission Priority Policy Element defined in 
           this document. This way, the RSVP-based admission control 
           can take this information into account at every RSVP-enabled 
           network hop. 
            
      (2)  Copy the application-level resource priority requirements 
           (e.g. as communicated in SIP Resource-Priority Header) 
           inside the new RSVP Application-Level Resource-Priority 
           Header Policy Element defined in this document. Conveying 
           the application-level resource priority requirements inside 
           the RSVP message allows this application level requirement 
           to be remapped into a different RSVP "admission priority" at 
           every administrative domain boundary based on the policy 
           applicable in that domain.  
            
           For example, the first domain may honor the resource 
           priority requirement and map it into a high RSVP admission 
           control priority while the second domain may decide to not 
           honor that resource priority requirement and map it into the 
 
 
Le Faucheur, et al.                                           [Page 4] 

                RSVP Extensions for Emergency Services      March 2006 
 
 
           default (lowest) RSVP admission control priority. As another 
           example, we can consider the case where the resource 
           priority header enumerates several namespaces, as explicitly 
           allowed by [SIP-PRIORITY], for support of scenarios where 
           calls traverse multiple administrative domains using 
           different namespace. In that case, the relevant namespace 
           can be used at the domain boundary to map into an RSVP 
           Admission priority. It is not expected that the RSVP 
           Application-Level Resource-Priority Header Policy Element 
           would be taken into account at RSVP-hops within a given 
           administrative domain. It is expected to be used at 
           administrative domain boundaries only in order to set/reset 
           the RSVP Admission Priority Policy Element. 
            
           Note: The existence of pre-established inter-domain policy 
           agreements or Service Level Agreements may preclude the need 
           to take real-time action on step (2) at domain boundaries.   
           Also, step (2) may be applied to boundaries between various 
           signaling protocols, such as those advanced by the NSIS 
           working group. 
       
       
   Note that this operates in a very similar manner to the case where 
   the priority requirement of the emergency call involves preemption 
   priority. In that case, the devices involved in the session 
   establishment map the emergency call requirement into an RSVP 
   "preemption priority" level (or more accurately into both a setup 
   preemption level and a defending preemption priority level) and 
   convey this information in the relevant RSVP messages used for 
   admission control. This preemption priority information is encoded 
   inside the Preemption Priority Policy Element of [RSVP-PREEMP] and 
   thus, can be taken into account at every RSVP-enabled network hop. 
    
2.1.  Operations of Admission Priority  
    
   The RSVP Admission Priority policy element defined in this document 
   allows admission bandwidth to be allocated selectively to an 
   authorized priority service. Multiple models of bandwidth allocation 
   MAY be used to that end. However, the bandwidth allocation model MUST 
   ensure that it is possible to limit admission of non-priority traffic 
   [Respectively, lower priority traffic] to a maximum bandwidth which 
   can be configured below the link capacity (or below the bandwidth 
   granted by the scheduler to the relevant Diffserv PHB) thereby 
   ensuring that some capacity is effectively set aside for admission of 
   priority traffic [Respectively, higher priority traffic]. 
    
   A number of bandwidth allocation models have been defined in the IETF 
   for allocation of bandwidth across different classes of traffic 
   trunks in the context of Diffserv-aware MPLS Traffic Engineering. 
 
 
Le Faucheur, et al.                                           [Page 5] 

                RSVP Extensions for Emergency Services      March 2006 
 
 
   Those include the Maximum Allocation Model (MAM) defined in [DSTE-
   MAM] and the Russian Dolls Model (RDM) specified in [DSTE-RDM]. These 
   same models MAY however be applied for allocation of bandwidth across 
   different levels of admission priority as defined in this document. 
   Sections 2.1.1 and 2.1.2 respectively illustrate how MAM and RDM can 
   indeed be used for support of admission priority. Section 2.1.3 
   illustrates how a simple "priority bypass" model can also be used for 
   support of admission priority. 
    
   For simplicity, operations with only a single "priority" level 
   (beyond non-priority) are illustrated here; However, the reader will 
   appreciate that operations with multiple priority levels can easily 
   be supported with these models.

2.1.1. 
       Illustration of Admission Priority with Maximum Allocation Model 
    
   This section illustrates operations of admission priority when a 
   Maximum Allocation Model is used for bandwidth allocation across non-
   priority traffic and priority traffic. A property of the Maximum 
   Allocation Model is that priority traffic can not use more than the 
   bandwidth made available to priority traffic (even if the non-
   priority traffic is not using all of the bandwidth available for it).

           Chart 1. MAM Bandwidth Allocation 
    
   Chart 1 shows a link within a routed network conforming to this 
   document. On this link are two amounts of bandwidth available to two 
   types of traffic: non-priority and priority.   
 
 
Le Faucheur, et al.                                           [Page 6]

   If the non-priority traffic load reaches the maximum bandwidth 
   available for non-priority, no additional non-priority sessions can 
   be accepted even if the bandwidth reserved for priority traffic is 
   not currently fully utilized. 
    
   With the Maximum Allocation Model, in the case where the priority 
   load reaches the maximum bandwidth reserved for priority calls, no 
   additional priority sessions can be accepted. 
    
   As illustrated in Chart 1, an operator may map the MAM model onto the 
   Engineered Capacity limits according to different policies. At one 
   extreme, where the proportion of priority traffic is reliably known 
   to be fairly small at all times and where there may be some safety 
   margin factored in the engineered capacity limits, the operator may 
   decide to configure the bandwidth available for non-priority use to 
   the full engineered capacity limits; effectively allowing the 
   priority traffic to ride within the safety margin of this engineered 
   capacity. This policy can be seen as an economically attractive 
   approach as all of the engineered capacity is made available to non-
   priority calls. This policy illustrated as (1) in Chart 1. As an 
   example, if the engineered capacity limit on a given link is X, the 
   operator may configure the bandwidth available to non-priority 
   traffic to X, and the bandwidth available to priority traffic to 5% 
   of X. 
    
   At the other extreme, where the proportion of priority traffic may be 
   significant at times and the engineered capacity limits are very 
   tight, the operator may decide to configure the bandwidth available 
   to non-priority traffic and the bandwidth available to priority 
   traffic such that their sum is equal to the engineered capacity 
   limits. This guarantees that the total load across non-priority and 
   priority traffic is always below the engineered capacity and, in turn, 
   guarantees there will never be any QoS degradation. However, this 
   policy is less attractive economically as it prevents non-priority 
   calls from using the full engineered capacity, even when there is no 
   or little priority load, which is the majority of time. This policy 
   illustrated as (3) in Chart 1. As an example, if the engineered 
   capacity limit on a given link is X, the operator may configure the 
   bandwidth available to non-priority traffic to 95% of X, and the 
   bandwidth available to priority traffic to 5% of X. 
    
   Of course, an operator may also strike a balance anywhere in between 
   these two approaches. This policy illustrated as (2) in Chart 1. 
    
   Chart 2 shows some of the non-priority capacity of this link being 
   used.

   In that case additional priority sessions could not be accepted. Note

   This section illustrates operations of admission priority when a 
   Russian Dolls Model is used for bandwidth allocation across non-
   priority traffic and priority traffic. A property of the Russian 
   Dolls Model is that priority traffic can use the bandwidth which is 
   not currently used by non-priority traffic. 
    
   As with the MAM model, an operator may map the RDM model onto the 
   Engineered Capacity limits according to different policies. The 
   operator may decide to configure the bandwidth available for non-
   priority use to the full engineered capacity limits; As an example, 
   if the engineered capacity limit on a given link is X, the operator 
   may configure the bandwidth available to non-priority traffic to X, 
   and the bandwidth available to non-priority and priority traffic to 
   105% of X.  
    
   Alternatively, the operator may decide to configure the bandwidth 
   available to non-priority and priority traffic to the engineered 
   capacity limits; As an example, if the engineered capacity limit on a 
   given link is X, the operator may configure the bandwidth available 
   to non-priority traffic to 95% of X, and the bandwidth available to 
   non-priority and priority traffic to X.  
    
   Finally, the operator may decide to strike a balance in between. The 
   considerations presented for these policies in the previous section 
   in the MAM context are equally applicable to RDM.  
    
   Chart 6 shows the case where only some of the bandwidth available to 
   non-priority traffic is being used and a small amount of priority 
   traffic is in place. In that situation both new non-priority sessions 
   and new priority sessions would be accepted.

2.1.3. 
       Illustration of Admission Priority with Priority Bypass Model 
    
   This section illustrates operations of admission priority when a 
   simple Priority Bypass Model is used for bandwidth allocation across 
   non-priority traffic and priority traffic. With the Priority Bypass 
   Model, non-priority traffic is subject to resource based admission 
   control while priority traffic simply bypasses the resource based 
   admission control. In other words: 
      - when a non-priority call arrives, this call is subject to 
   bandwidth admission control and is accepted if the current total load 
   (aggregate over non-priority and priority traffic) is below the 
   engineered/allocated bandwidth.  
      - when a priority call arrives, this call is admitted regardless 
   of the current load.  
    
   A property of this model is that a priority call is never rejected. 
 
 
Le Faucheur, et al.                                          [Page 12] 

                RSVP Extensions for Emergency Services      March 2006 
 
 
    
   The rationale for this simple scheme is that, in practice in some 
   networks: 
      - the volume of priority calls is very low for the vast majority 
        of time, so it may not be economical to completely set aside 
        bandwidth for priority calls and preclude the utilization of 
        this bandwidth by normal calls in normal situations 
      - even in emergency periods where priority calls are more heavily 
        used, those always still represent a fairly small proportion of 
        the overall load which can be absorbed within the safety margin 
        of the engineered capacity limits. Thus, even if they are 
        admitted beyond the engineered bandwidth threshold, they are 
        unlikely to result in noticeable QoS degradation. 
    
   As with the MAM and RDM model, an operator may map the Priority 
   Bypass model onto the Engineered Capacity limits according to 
   different policies. The operator may decide to configure the 
   bandwidth limit for admission of non-priority traffic to the full 
   engineered capacity limits; As an example, if the engineered capacity 
   limit on a given link is X, the operator may configure the bandwidth 
   limit for non-priority traffic to X. Alternatively, the operator may 
   decide to configure the bandwidth limit for non-priority traffic to 
   below the engineered capacity limits (so that the sum of the non-
   priority and priority traffic stays below the engineered capacity); 
   As an example, if the engineered capacity limit on a given link is X, 
   the operator may configure the bandwidth limit for non-priority 
   traffic to 95% of X. Finally, the operator may decide to strike a 
   balance in between. The considerations presented for these policies 
   in the previous sections in the MAM and RDM contexts are equally 
   applicable to the Priority Bypass Model.  
    
   Chart 10 shows illustrates the bandwidth allocation with the Priority 
   Bypass Model.

3.  New Policy Elements 
 
3.1.  Admission Priority Policy Element 
    
   [RSVP-POLICY] defines extensions for supporting generic policy based 
   admission control in RSVP. These extensions include the standard 
   format of POLICY_DATA objects and a description of RSVP handling of 
   policy events.  
    
   The POLICY_DATA object contains one or more of Policy Elements, each 
   representing a different (and perhaps orthogonal) policy. As an 
   example, [RSVP-PREEMP] specifies the Preemption Priority Policy 
   Element.  
    
   This document defines a new Policy Element called the Admission 
   Priority Policy Element. 
    
   The format of Admission Priority policy element is as follows: 
    
         +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ 
         |     Length                | P-Type = ADMISSION_PRI    |

       Priority. 0 represents the highest priority. A reservation 
       established without an Admission Priority policy element is 
       equivalent to a reservation established with the lowest 
       supported admission priority. 
        
       Bandwidth allocation models such as those described in section 
       2.1 are to be used by the RSVP router to achieve such increased 
       probability of call completion. The admission priority value

   session justifies both admission priority and preemption priority, 
   the corresponding RSVP reservation needs to carry both an Admission 
   Priority Policy Element and a Preemption Priority Policy Element.  
    
   It has been identified that some ETS emergency type sessions would 
   need: 
      - to benefit from elevated admission priority 
      - to be able to preempt other ETS emergency type sessions (the 
   ones with lower preemption priorities)  
      - to not be able to preempt non-emergency sessions. 
   One approach to address this requirement is to add a new Flag in the 
   Preemption Priority Policy Element in order to reduce the scope of 
   the RSVP preemption mechanism to emergency sessions. Feedback is 
   sought on this requirement and potential solution. This will be 
   addressed further in next revisions of this document.  
     
        
3.1.1. 
       Admission Priority Merging Rules 
    
   This session discusses alternatives for dealing with RSVP admission 
   priority in case of merging of reservations. As merging is only 
   applicable to multicast, this section also only applies to multicast 
   sessions. 
    
3.1.1.1   Admission Priority Merging Strategies 
    
   In merging situations Local Decision Points (LDPs) may receive 
   multiple admission priority elements and must compute the admission 
   priority of the merged flow according to the following rules: 
    
       a. Participating admission priority elements are selected. 
   All admission priority elements are examined according to their 
   merging strategy to decide whether they should participate in the 
   merged result (as specified below). 
    
       b. The highest admission priority of all participating admission 
   priority elements is computed. 
    
   The remainder of this section describes the different merging 
   strategies the can be specified in the ADMISSION_PRI element. 
    
3.1.1.2   Take priority of highest QoS 
    
   The ADMISSION_PRI element would participate in the merged reservation 
   only if it belongs to a flow that contributed to the merged QoS level 
   (i.e., that its QoS requirement does not constitute a subset of 
   another reservation.)  A simple way to determine whether a flow 
   contributed to the merged QoS result is to compute the merged QoS 

 
 
Le Faucheur, et al.                                          [Page 17] 

                RSVP Extensions for Emergency Services      March 2006 
 
 
   with and without it and to compare the results (although this is 
   clearly not the most efficient method). 
    
   The reasoning for this approach is that the highest QoS flow is the 
   one dominating the merged reservation and as such its priority should 
   dominate it as well.  
    
3.1.1.3   Take highest priority 
    
   All ADMISSION_PRI elements participate in the merged reservation. 
    
   This strategy disassociates priority and QoS level, and therefore is 
   highly subject to free-riders and its inverse image, denial of 
   service. 
    
3.1.1.4   Force error on heterogeneous merge 
    
   A ADMISSION_PRI element may participate in a merged reservation only 
   if all other flows in the merged reservation have the same QoS level 
   (homogeneous flows). 
    
   The reasoning for this approach assumes that the heterogeneous case 
   is relatively rare and too complicated to deal with, thus it better 
   be prohibited. 
    
   This strategy lends itself to denial of service, when a single 
   receiver specifying a non-compatible QoS level may cause denial of 
   service for all other receivers of the merged reservation. 
    
   Note: The determination of heterogeneous flows applies to QoS level 
   only (FLOWSPEC values), and is a matter for local (LDP) definition. 
   Other types of heterogeneous reservations (e.g. conflicting 
   reservation styles) are handled by RSVP and are unrelated to this 
   ADMISSION_PRI element. 
    
3.1.2. 
      Modifying Admission Priority Elements 
    
   When POLICY_DATA objects are protected by integrity, LDPs should not   
   attempt to modify them. They must be forwarded as-is or else their 
   security envelope would be invalidated. In other cases, LDPs may 
   modify and merge incoming ADMISSION _PRI elements to reduce their 
   size and number according to the following rule: 
    
   Merging is performed for each merging strategy separately. 
    
   There is no known algorithm to merge ADMISSION_PRI element of 
   different merging strategies without losing valuable information that 
   may affect OTHER nodes. 
    
 
 
Le Faucheur, et al.                                          [Page 18] 

                RSVP Extensions for Emergency Services      March 2006 
 
 
      -  For each merging strategy, the highest QoS of all participating 
         ADMISSION _PRI elements is taken and is placed in an outgoing 
         ADMISSION _PRI element of this merging strategy. 
    
      -  This approach effectively compresses the number of forwarded 
         ADMISSION _PRI elements to at most to the number of different 
         merging strategies, regardless of the number of receivers. 
    
 
3.1.3. 
      Merging Error Processing 
    
   An Error Code is sent back (inside the Admission Priority Policy 
   Element) toward the appropriate receivers when an error involving 
   ADMISSION_PRI elements occur. 
    
      Heterogeneity 
       
      When a flow F1 with "Force Error on heterogeneous merge" merging 
      strategy set in its ADMISSION_PRI element encounters 
      heterogeneity, the ADMISSION_PRI element is sent back toward 
      receivers with the Heterogeneity error code set. 
 
        
3.2.  Application-Level Resource Priority Policy Element 
    
   This document defines another new Policy Element called the 
   Application-Level Resource Priority Element. 
    
   The format of Admission Priority policy element is as follows: 
    
         +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ 
         | Length                    | P-Type = APP_RESOURCE_PRI | 
         +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ 
         | Flags       | M. Strategy | Error Code  | Reserved    | 
         +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ 
         |       ARP Namespace       | ARP Priority| Reserved    | 
         +---------------------------+---------------------------+ 
    
    
   Length: 16 bits 
      Always 12. The overall length of the policy element, in bytes. 
    
   P-Type: 16 bits 
       APP_RESOURCE_PRI  = To be allocated by IANA  
      (see "IANA Considerations" section) 
    
   Flags: 8 bits 
       Reserved (always 0).

   Error code: 8 bits (only applicable to multicast flows)

   Reserved: 8 bits 
       Always 0. 
    
   ARP Namespace (Application-Level Resource Priority Namespace):  
       16 bits (unsigned) 
       Contains the namespace of the application-level resource 
       priority. This is encoded as a numerical value which represents 
       the position of the namespace in the "Resource-Priority 
       Namespace" IANA registry, starting with 0. Creation of this 
       registry has been requested to IANA in [SIP-PRIORITY]. 
       For example, as "dsn", "drsn", "q735", "ets" and "wps" are 
       currently the first, second, third, fourth and fifth namespaces 
       defined in the "Resource-Priority Namespace" registry, those are 
       respectively encoded as value 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4. 
    
   ARP Priority: (Application-Level Resource Priority Priority): 
       8 bits (unsigned) 
       Contains the priority value within the namespace of the 
       application-level resource priority. 
       This is encoded as a numerical value which represents the 
       priority defined in the "Resource-Priority Namespace" IANA 
       registry for the considered namespace, starting from 0 for the 
       highest priority and increasing as priority decreases. 
       For example, as "flash-override", "flash", "immediate", 
       "priority" and "routine" are the priorities in decreasing order 
       of priority registered for the "dsn" namespace, those are 
       respectively encoded as value 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4. 
        
   Reserved: 16 bits 
       Always 0. 
        
        
   Multiple instances of Application-Level Resource Priority Policy 
   Elements may appear in a POLICY_DATA object or in different 
   POLICY_DATA objects. This can be used to convey application-level 
   resource priority requirements in multiple namespaces in a single 
   RSVP message (in a similar manner to how multiple namespace 
   priorities can be conveyed in the SIP Resource-Priority Header of 
   [SIP-PRIORITY]). As discussed earlier, this is useful for calls which 
   transit through multiple administrative domains.

Le Faucheur, et al.                                          [Page 20] 

                RSVP Extensions for Emergency Services      March 2006 
 
 
   This session discusses alternatives for dealing with RSVP 
   application-level resource priority in case of merging of 
   reservations. As merging is only applicable to multicast, this 
   section also only applies to multicast sessions. 
    
   This will be discussed in the next revision of this document. 
    
   [Editor's note: One approach could be to ensure that the reunion of 
   all the namespaces is included in the merge (ie if one receiver 
   includes namespace1.prio1 and another one includes namespace2.prio2, 
   the merged reservation will contain both namespace1.prio1 and 
   namespace2.prio2. Feedback on that is sought] 
    
    
4.  Security Considerations 
    
   The integrity of ADMISSION_PRI and APP_RESOURCE_PRI is guaranteed, as 
   any other policy element, by the encapsulation into a Policy Data 
   object [RSVP-POLICY]. The two optional security mechanisms discussed 
   in section 6 of [RSVP-POLICY] can be used to protect the 
   ADMISSION_PRI and APP_RESOURCE_PRI policy elements. 
    
    
5.  IANA Considerations  
    
   As specified in [POLICY-RSVP], Standard RSVP Policy Elements (P-type 
   values) are to be assigned by IANA as per "IETF Consensus" following 
   the policies outlined in [IANA-CONSIDERATIONS]. 
    
   IANA needs to allocate two P-Types from the Standard RSVP Policy 
   Element range: 
           - one P-Type to the Admission Priority Policy Element 
           - one P-Type to the Application-Level Resource Priority 
             Policy Element

   We would like to thank An Nguyen for his encouragement to address 
   this topic and ongoing comments. Also, this document borrows heavily 
   from some of the work of S. Herzog on Preemption Priority Policy 
   Element [RSVP-PREEMP]. Dave Oran and Janet Gunn provided useful input 
   into this document.
