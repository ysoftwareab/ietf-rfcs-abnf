Introduction</h3>

<p>This document describes a massively scalable reliable content
      delivery protocol, Asynchronous Layered Coding (ALC), for multiple rate
      congestion controlled reliable content delivery. The protocol is
      specifically designed to provide massive scalability using IP multicast
      as the underlying network service. Massive scalability in this context
      means the number of concurrent receivers for an object is potentially in
      the millions, the aggregate size of objects to be delivered in a session
      ranges from hundreds of kilobytes to hundreds of gigabytes, each
      receiver can initiate reception of an object asynchronously, the
      reception rate of each receiver in the session is the maximum fair
      bandwidth available between that receiver and the sender, and all of
      this can be supported using a single sender.
</p>
<p>Because ALC is focused on reliable content delivery, the goal is to
      deliver objects as quickly as possible to each receiver while at the
      same time remaining network friendly to competing traffic. Thus, the
      congestion control used in conjunction with ALC should strive to
      maximize use of available bandwidth between receivers and the sender
      while at the same time backing off aggressively in the face of competing
      traffic.
</p>
<p>The sender side of ALC consists of generating packets based on
      objects to be delivered within the session and sending the appropriately
      formatted packets at the appropriate rates to the channels associated
      with the session. The receiver side of ALC consists of joining
      appropriate channels associated with the session, performing congestion
      control by adjusting the set of joined channels associated with the
      session in response to detected congestion, and using the packets to
      reliably reconstruct objects. All information flow in an ALC session is
      in the form of data packets sent by a single sender to channels that
      receivers join to receive data.
</p>
<p>ALC does specify the Session Description needed by receivers before
      they join a session, but the mechanisms by which receivers obtain this
      required information is outside the scope of ALC. An application that
      uses ALC may require that receivers report statistics on their reception
      experience back to the sender, but the mechanisms by which receivers
      report back statistics is outside the scope of ALC. In general, ALC is
      designed to be a minimal protocol instantiation that provides reliable
      content delivery without unnecessary limitations to the scalability of
      the basic protocol.

<p>ALC can support several different reliable content delivery service
        models as described in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-rmt-bb-lct-revised'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;rmt&#8209;bb&#8209;lct&#8209;revised]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Luby, M., Watson, M., and L.

<a name="rfc.section.1.2"></a><h3>1.2.&nbsp;
Scalability</h3>

<p>Massive scalability is a primary design goal for ALC. IP multicast
        is inherently massively scalable, but the best effort service that it
        provides does not provide session management functionality, congestion
        control or reliability. ALC provides all of this on top of IP
        multicast without sacrificing any of the inherent scalability of IP
        multicast. ALC has the following properties:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>To each receiver, it appears as if though there is a dedicated
            session from the sender to the receiver, where the reception rate
            adjusts to congestion along the path from sender to receiver.
</li>
<li>To the sender, there is no difference in load or outgoing rate
            if one receiver is joined to the session or a million (or any
            number of) receivers are joined to the session, independent of
            when the receivers join and leave.
</li>
<li>No feedback packets are required from receivers to the
            sender.
</li>
<li>Almost all packets in the session that pass through a
            bottleneck link are utilized by downstream receivers, and the
            session shares the link with competing flows fairly in proportion
            to their utility.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, ALC provides a massively scalable content delivery transport
        that is network friendly.
</p>
<p>ALC intentionally omits any application specific features that
        could potentially limit its scalability. By doing so, ALC provides a
        minimal protocol that is massively scalable. Applications may be built
        on top of ALC to provide additional features that may limit the
        scalability of the application. Such applications are outside the
        scope of this document.

<a name="rfc.section.1.3"></a><h3>1.3.&nbsp;
Environmental Requirements and Considerations</h3>

<p>All of the environmental requirements and considerations that apply
        to the LCT building block <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-rmt-bb-lct-revised'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;rmt&#8209;bb&#8209;lct&#8209;revised]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Luby, M., Watson, M., and L. Vicisano, &ldquo;Layered Coding Transport (LCT) Building Block,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>, the FEC building block
        <a class='info' href='#RFC5052'>[RFC5052]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Watson, M., Luby, M., and L. Vicisano, &ldquo;Forward Error Correction (FEC) Building Block,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>, the multiple rate congestion control
        building block and to any additional building blocks that ALC uses
        also apply to ALC.
</p>
<p>One issues that is specific to ALC with respect to the Any- Source
        Multicast (ASM) model of IP multicast as defined in RFC 1112 <a class='info' href='#RFC1112'>[RFC1112]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Deering, S., &ldquo;Host extensions for IP multicasting,&rdquo; August&nbsp;1989.</span><span>)</span></a> is the way the multiple rate congestion
        control building block interacts with ASM. The congestion control
        building block may use the measured difference in time between when a
        join to a channel is sent and when the first packet from the channel
        arrives in determining the receiver reception rate. The congestion
        control building block may also uses packet sequence numbers per
        channel to measure losses, and this is also used to determine the
        receiver reception rate. These features raise two concerns with
        respect to ASM: The time difference between when the join to a channel
        is sent and when the first packet arrives can be significant due to
        the use of Rendezvous Points (RPs) and the MSDP protocol, and packets
        can be lost in the switch over from the (*,G) join to the RP and the
        (S,G) join directly to the sender. Both of these issues could
        potentially substantially degrade the reception rate of receivers. To
        ameliorate these concerns, it is RECOMMENDED that the RP be as close
        to the sender as possible. SSM does not share these same concerns. For
        a fuller consideration of these issues, consult the multiple rate
        congestion control building block.

Architecture Definition</h3>

<p>ALC uses the LCT building block <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-rmt-bb-lct-revised'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;rmt&#8209;bb&#8209;lct&#8209;revised]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Luby, M., Watson, M., and L. Vicisano, &ldquo;Layered Coding Transport (LCT) Building Block,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> to provide in-band session
      management functionality. ALC uses a multiple rate congestion control
      building block that is compliant with <a class='info' href='#RFC2357'>[RFC2357]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Mankin, A., Romanov, A., Bradner, S., and V. Paxson, &ldquo;IETF Criteria for Evaluating Reliable Multicast Transport and Application Protocols,&rdquo; June&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a> to
      provide congestion control that is feedback free. Receivers adjust their
      reception rates individually by joining and leaving channels associated
      with the session. ALC uses the FEC building block <a class='info' href='#RFC5052'>[RFC5052]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Watson, M., Luby, M., and L. Vicisano, &ldquo;Forward Error Correction (FEC) Building Block,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> to provide reliability. The sender generates
      encoding symbols based on the object to be delivered using FEC codes and
      sends them in packets to channels associated with the session. Receivers
      simply wait for enough packets to arrive in order to reliably
      reconstruct the object. Thus, there is no request for retransmission of
      individual packets from receivers that miss packets in order to assure
      reliable reception of an object, and the packets and their rate of
      transmission out of the sender can be independent of the number and the
      individual reception experiences of the receivers.
</p>
<p>The definition of a session for ALC is the same as it is for LCT. An
      ALC session comprises multiple channels originating at a single sender
      that are used for some period of time to carry packets pertaining to the
      transmission of one or more objects that can be of interest to
      receivers. Congestion control is performed over the aggregate of packets
      sent to channels belonging to a session. The fact that an ALC session is
      restricted to a single sender does not preclude the possibility of
      receiving packets for the same objects from multiple senders. However,
      each sender would be sending packets to a a different session to which
      congestion control is individually applied. Although receiving
      concurrently from multiple sessions is allowed, how this is done at the
      application level is outside the scope of this document.
</p>
<p>ALC is a protocol instantiation as defined in <a class='info' href='#RFC3048'>[RFC3048]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Whetten, B., Vicisano, L., Kermode, R., Handley, M., Floyd, S., and M. Luby, &ldquo;Reliable Multicast Transport Building Blocks for One-to-Many Bulk-Data Transfer,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a>. This document describes version 1 of ALC which
      MUST use version 1 of LCT described in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-rmt-bb-lct-revised'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;rmt&#8209;bb&#8209;lct&#8209;revised]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Luby, M., Watson, M., and L. Vicisano, &ldquo;Layered Coding Transport (LCT) Building Block,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>. Like LCT, ALC is designed
      to be used with the IP multicast network service. This specification
      defines ALC as payload of the UDP transport protocol <a class='info' href='#RFC0768'>[RFC0768]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Postel, J., &ldquo;User Datagram Protocol,&rdquo; August&nbsp;1980.</span><span>)</span></a> that supports IP multicast delivery of
      packets.
</p>
<p>An ALC packet header immediately follows the UDP header and consists
      of the default LCT header that is described in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-rmt-bb-lct-revised'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;rmt&#8209;bb&#8209;lct&#8209;revised]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Luby, M., Watson, M., and L. Vicisano, &ldquo;Layered Coding Transport (LCT) Building Block,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> followed by the FEC Payload
      ID that is described in <a class='info' href='#RFC5052'>[RFC5052]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Watson, M., Luby, M., and L. Vicisano, &ldquo;Forward Error Correction (FEC) Building Block,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>. The Congestion
      Control Information field within the LCT header carries the required
      Congestion Control Information that is described in the multiple rate
      congestion control building block specified that is compliant with <a class='info' href='#RFC2357'>[RFC2357]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Mankin, A., Romanov, A., Bradner, S., and V. Paxson, &ldquo;IETF Criteria for Evaluating Reliable Multicast Transport and Application Protocols,&rdquo; June&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a>. The packet payload that follows the ALC packet
      header consists of encoding symbols that are identified by the FEC
      Payload ID as described in <a class='info' href='#RFC5052'>[RFC5052]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Watson, M., Luby, M., and L. Vicisano, &ldquo;Forward Error Correction (FEC) Building Block,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>Each receiver is required to obtain a Session Description before
      joining an ALC session. As described later, the Session Description
      includes out-of-band information required for the LCT, FEC and the
      multiple rate congestion control building blocks. The FEC Object
      Transmission Information specified in the FEC building block <a class='info' href='#RFC5052'>[RFC5052]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Watson, M., Luby, M., and L. Vicisano, &ldquo;Forward Error Correction (FEC) Building Block,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> required for each object to be received by a
      receiver can be communicated to a receiver either out-of-band or in-band
      using a Header Extension. The means for communicating the Session
      Description and the FEC Object Transmission Information to a receiver is
      outside the scope of this document.

<a name="rfc.section.2.1"></a><h3>2.1.&nbsp;
LCT building block</h3>

<p>LCT requires receivers to be able to uniquely identify and
        demultiplex packets associated with an LCT session, and ALC inherits
        and strengthens this requirement. A Transport Session Identifier (TSI)
        MUST be associated with each session and MUST be carried in the LCT
        header of each ALC packet. The TSI is scoped by the sender IP address,
        and the (sender IP address, TSI) pair MUST uniquely identify the
        session.
</p>
<p>The LCT header contains a Congestion Control Information (CCI)
        field that MUST be used to carry the Congestion Control Information
        from the specified multiple rate congestion control protocol. There is
        a field in the LCT header that specifies the length of the CCI field,
        and the multiple rate congestion control building block MUST uniquely
        identify a format of the CCI field that corresponds to this
        length.
</p>
<p>The LCT header contains a Codepoint field that MAY be used to
        communicate to a receiver the settings for information that may vary
        during a session. If used, the mapping between settings and Codepoint
        values is to be communicated in the Session Description, and this
        mapping is outside the scope of this document. For example, the FEC
        Encoding ID that is part of the FEC Object Transmission Information as
        specified in the FEC building block <a class='info' href='#RFC5052'>[RFC5052]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Watson, M., Luby, M., and L. Vicisano, &ldquo;Forward Error Correction (FEC) Building Block,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>
        could vary for each object carried in the session, and the Codepoint
        value could be used to communicate the FEC Encoding ID to be used for
        each object. The mapping between FEC Encoding IDs and Codepoints could
        be, for example, the identity mapping.
</p>
<p>If more than one object is to be carried within a session then the
        Transmission Object Identifier (TOI) MUST be used in the LCT header to
        identify which packets are to be associated with which objects. In
        this case the receiver MUST use the TOI to associate received packets
        with objects. The TOI is scoped by the IP address of the sender and
        the TSI, i.e., the TOI is scoped by the session. The TOI for each
        object is REQUIRED to be unique within a session, but is not required
        be unique across sessions. Furthermore, the same object MAY have a
        different TOI in different sessions. The mapping between TOIs and
        objects carried in a session is outside the scope of this
        document.
</p>
<p>If only one object is carried within a session then the TOI MAY be
        omitted from the LCT header.
</p>
<p>The LCT header from version 1 of the LCT building block <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-rmt-bb-lct-revised'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;rmt&#8209;bb&#8209;lct&#8209;revised]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Luby, M., Watson, M., and L. Vicisano, &ldquo;Layered Coding Transport (LCT) Building Block,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> MUST be used.
</p>
<p>The LCT Header includes a two-bit Protocol Specific Indication
        (PSI) field in bits 6 and 7 of the first word of the LCT header. These
        two bits are used by ALC as follows: <br /><hr class="insert" />

 </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>PSI bit X - Source Packet Indicator (SPI)
</p>
<p>PSI bit Y - Reserved
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Source Packet Indicator is used with systematic FEC Schemes
        which define a different FEC Payload ID format for packets containing
        only source data compared to the FEC Payload ID format for packets
        containing repair data. For such FEC Schemes, then the SPI MUST be set
        to 1 when the FEC Payload ID format for packets containing only source
        data is used and the SPI MUST be set to zero, when the FEC Payload ID
        for packerts containing repair data is used. In the case of FEC
        Schemes which define only a single FEC Payload ID format, then the SPI
        MUST be set to zero by the sender and MUST be ignored by the
        receiver.
</p>
<p>Support of two FEC Payload ID formats allows FEC Payload ID
        information which is only of relevance when FEC decoding is to be
        performed to be provided in the FEC Payload ID format for packets
        containing repair data. This information need not be processed by
        receivers which do not perform FEC decoding (either because no FEC
        decoding is required or because the receiver does not support FEC
        decoding).

Multiple rate congestion control building block</h3>

<p>At a minimum, implementions of ALC MUST support <a class='info' href='#RFC3738'>[RFC3738]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Luby, M. and V. Goyal, &ldquo;Wave and Equation Based Rate Control (WEBRC) Building Block,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>Congestion control MUST be applied to all packets within a session
        independently of which information about which object is carried in
        each packet. Multiple rate congestion control is specified because of
        its suitability to scale massively and because of its suitability for
        reliable content delivery. <a class='info' href='#RFC3738'>[RFC3738]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Luby, M. and V. Goyal, &ldquo;Wave and Equation Based Rate Control (WEBRC) Building Block,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a> specifies
        in-band Congestion Control Information (CCI) that MUST be carried in
        the CCI field of the LCT header.
</p>
<p>Alternative multiple rate congestion control building blocks MAY be
        supported. The multiple rate congestion control building block MAY
        specify more than one format for the CCI field, but it MUST specify at
        most one format for each of the possible lengths 32, 64, 96 or 128
        bits. The value of C in the LCT header that determines the length of
        the CCI field MUST correspond to one of the lengths for the CCI
        defined in the multiple rate congestion control building block, this
        length MUST be the same for all packets sent to a session, and the CCI
        format that corresponds to the length as specified in the multiple
        rate congestion control building block MUST be the format used for the
        CCI field in the LCT header.
</p>
<p>When using a multiple rate congestion control building block a
        sender sends packets in the session to several channels at potentially
        different rates. Then, individual receivers adjust their reception
        rate within a session by adjusting which set of channels they are
        joined to at each point in time depending on the available bandwidth
        between the receiver and the sender, but independent of other
        receivers.

FEC building block</h3>

<p>The FEC building block <a class='info' href='#RFC5052'>[RFC5052]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Watson, M., Luby, M., and L. Vicisano, &ldquo;Forward Error Correction (FEC) Building Block,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> provides
        reliable object delivery within an ALC session. Each object sent in
        the session is independently encoded using FEC codes as described in
        <a class='info' href='#RFC3453'>[RFC3453]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Luby, M., Vicisano, L., Gemmell, J., Rizzo, L., Handley, M., and J. Crowcroft, &ldquo;The Use of Forward Error Correction (FEC) in Reliable Multicast,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>, which provide a more in-depth
        description of the use of FEC codes in reliable content delivery
        protocols. All packets in an ALC session MUST contain an FEC Payload
        ID in a format that is compliant with the FEC Scheme in use. The FEC
        Payload ID uniquely identifies the encoding symbols that constitute
        the payload of each packet, and the receiver MUST use the FEC Payload
        ID to determine how the encoding symbols carried in the payload of the
        packet were generated from the object as described in the FEC building
        block.
</p>
<p>As described in <a class='info' href='#RFC5052'>[RFC5052]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Watson, M., Luby, M., and L. Vicisano, &ldquo;Forward Error Correction (FEC) Building Block,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>, a receiver is
        REQUIRED to obtain the FEC Object Transmission Information for each
        object for which data packets are received from the session. In the
        context of ALC, the FEC Object Transmission Information includes:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The FEC Encoding ID.
</li>
<li>If an Under-Specified FEC Encoding ID is used then the FEC
            Instance ID associated with the FEC Encoding ID.
</li>
<li>For each object in the session, the transfer length of the
            object in bytes.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Additional FEC Object Transmission Information may be required
        depending on the FEC Scheme that is used (identified by the FEC
        Encoding ID).
</p>
<p>Some of the FEC Object Transmission Information MAY be implicit
        based on the FEC Scheme and/or implementation. As an example, source
        block lengths may be derived by a fixed algorithm from the object
        length. As another example, it may be that all source blocks are the
        same length and this is what is passed out-of-band to the receiver. As
        another example, it could be that the full sized source block length
        is provided and this is the length used for all but the last source
        block, which is calculated based on the full source block length and
        the object length. As another example, it could be that the same FEC
        Encoding ID and FEC Instance ID are always used for a particular
        application and thus the FEC Encoding ID and FEC Instance ID are
        implicitly defined.
</p>
<p>Sometimes the objects that will be sent in a session are completely
        known before the receiver joins the session, in which case the FEC
        Object Transmission Information for all objects in the session can be
        communicated to receivers before they join the session. At other times
        the objects may not know when the session begins, or receivers may
        join a session in progress and may not be interested in some objects
        for which transmission has finished, or receivers may leave a session
        before some objects are even available within the session. In these
        cases, the FEC Object Transmission Information for each object may be
        dynamically communicated to receivers at or before the time packets
        for the object are received from the session. This may be accomplished
        using either an out-of-band mechanism, in-band using the Codepoint
        field or a Header Extension, or any combination of these methods. How
        the FEC Object Transmission Information is communicated to receivers
        is outside the scope of this document.
</p>
<p>If packets for more than one object are transmitted within a
        session then a Transmission Object Identifier (TOI) that uniquely
        identifies objects within a session MUST appear in each packet header.
        Portions of the FEC Object Transmission Information could be the same
        for all objects in the session, in which case these portions can be
        communicated to the receiver with an indication that this applies to
        all objects in the session. These portions may be implicitly
        determined based on the application, e.g., an application may use the
        same FEC Encoding ID for all objects in all sessions. If there is a
        portion of the FEC Object Transmission Information that may vary from
        object to object and if this FEC Object Transmission Information is
        communicated to a receiver out-of-band then the TOI for the object
        MUST also be communicated to the receiver together with the
        corresponding FEC Object Transmission Information, and the receiver
        MUST use the corresponding FEC Object Transmission Information for all
        packets received with that TOI. How the TOI and corresponding FEC
        Object Transmission Information is communicated out-of-band to
        receivers is outside the scope of this document.
</p>
<p>It is also possible that there is a portion of the FEC Object
        Transmission Information that may vary from object to object that is
        carried in-band, for example in the CodePoint field or in Header
        Extensions. How this is done is outside the scope of this document. In
        this case the FEC Object Transmission Information is associated with
        the object identified by the TOI carried in the packet.

Session Description</h3>

<p>The Session Description that a receiver is REQUIRED to obtain
        before joining an ALC session MUST contain the following
        information:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The multiple rate congestion control building block to be used
            for the session;
</li>
<li>The sender IP address;
</li>
<li>The number of channels in the session;
</li>
<li>The address and port number used for each channel in the
            session;
</li>
<li>The Transport Session ID (TSI) to be used for the session;
</li>
<li>An indication of whether or not the session carries packets for
            more than one object;
</li>
<li>If Header Extensions are to be used, the format of these Header
            Extensions.
</li>
<li>Enough information to determine the packet authentication
            scheme being used, if it is being used.
</li>
</ul>

<p>How the Session Description is communicated to receivers is outside
        the scope of this document.
</p>
<p>The Codepoint field within the LCT portion of the header CAN be
        used to communicate in-band some of the dynamically changing
        information within a session. To do this, a mapping between Codepoint
        values and the different dynamic settings MUST be included within the
        Session Description, and then settings to be used are communicated via
        the Codepoint value placed into each packet. For example, it is
        possible that multiple objects are delivered within the same session
        and that a different FEC encoding algorithm is used for different
        types of objects. Then the Session Description could contain the
        mapping between Codepoint values and FEC Encoding IDs. As another
        example, it is possible that a different packet authentication scheme
        is used for different packets sent to the session. In this case, the
        mapping between the packet authentication scheme and Codepoint values
        could be provided in the Session Description. Combinations of settings
        can be mapped to Codepoint values as well. For example, a particular
        combination of a FEC Encoding ID and a packet authentication scheme
        could be associated with a Codepoint value.
</p>
<p>The Session Description could also include, but is not limited
        to:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The mappings between combinations of settings and Codepoint
            values;
</li>
<li>The data rates used for each channel;
</li>
<li>The length of the packet payload;
</li>
<li>Any information that is relevant to each object being
            transported, such as the Object Transmission Information for each
            object, when the object will be available within the session and
            for how long.
</li>
</ul>

Packet format used by ALC</h3>

<p>The packet format used by ALC is the UDP header followed by the LCT
        header followed by the FEC Payload ID followed by the packet payload.
        The LCT header is defined in the LCT building block <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-rmt-bb-lct-revised'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;rmt&#8209;bb&#8209;lct&#8209;revised]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Luby, M., Watson, M., and L. Vicisano, &ldquo;Layered Coding Transport (LCT) Building Block,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> and the FEC Payload ID is
        described in the FEC building block <a class='info' href='#RFC5052'>[RFC5052]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Watson, M., Luby, M., and L. Vicisano, &ldquo;Forward Error Correction (FEC) Building Block,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>.
        The Congestion Control Information field in the LCT header contains
        the REQUIRED Congestion Control Information that is described in the
        multiple rate congestion control building block used. The packet
        payload contains encoding symbols generated from an object. If more
        than one object is carried in the session then the Transmission Object
        ID (TOI) within the LCT header MUST be used to identify which object
        the encoding symbols are generated from. Within the scope of an
        object, encoding symbols carried in the payload of the packet are
        identified by the FEC Payload ID as described in the FEC building
        block.
</p>
<p>The version number of ALC specified in this document is 1. The
        version number field of the LCT header MUST be interpreted as the ALC
        version number field. This version of ALC implicitly makes use of
        version 1 of the LCT building block defined in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-rmt-bb-lct-revised'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;rmt&#8209;bb&#8209;lct&#8209;revised]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Luby, M., Watson, M., and L. Vicisano, &ldquo;Layered Coding Transport (LCT) Building Block,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>The overall ALC packet format is depicted in <a class='info' href='#ALCpfmt'>Figure&nbsp;2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Overall ALC packet format</span><span>)</span></a>. The packet is an IP packet, either IPv4 or
        IPv6, and the IP header precedes the UDP header. The ALC packet format
        has no dependencies on the IP version number.

<p>In some special cases an ALC sender may need to produce ALC packets
        that do not contain any payload. This may be required, for example, to
        signal the end of a session or to convey congestion control
        information. These data-less packets do not contain the FEC Payload ID
        either, but only the LCT header fields. The total datagram length,
        conveyed by outer protocol headers (e.g., the IP or UDP header),
        enables receivers to detect the absence of the ALC payload and FEC
        Payload ID.
</p>
<p>For ALC the length of the TSI field within the LCT header is
        REQUIRED to be non-zero. This implies that the sender MUST NOT set
        both the LCT flags S and H to zero.

        control building block.
</p>
<p>A sender using ALC MUST make available the required Session
        Description as described in <a class='info' href='#SeSessDes'>Section&nbsp;2.4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Session Description</span><span>)</span></a>. A sender
        also MUST make available the required FEC Object Transmission
        Information as described in <a class='info' href='#SeFECBB'>Section&nbsp;2.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>FEC building block</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>Within a session a sender transmits a sequence of packets to the
        channels associated with the session. The ALC sender MUST obey the
        rules for filling in the CCI field in the packet headers and MUST send
        packets at the appropriate rates to the channels associated with the
        session as dictated by the multiple rate congestion control building
        block.
</p>
<p>The ALC sender MUST use the same TSI for all packets in the
        session. Several objects MAY be delivered within the same ALC session.
        If more than one object is to be delivered within a session then the
        sender MUST use the TOI field and each object MUST be identified by a
        unique TOI within the session, and the sender MUST use corresponding
        TOI for all packets pertaining to the same object. The FEC Payload ID
        MUST correspond to the encoding symbol(s) for the object carried in
        the payload of the packet.

        control building block.
</p>
<p>To be able to participate in a session, a receiver MUST obtain the
        REQUIRED Session Description as listed in <a class='info' href='#SeSessDes'>Section&nbsp;2.4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Session Description</span><span>)</span></a>. How receivers obtain a Session Description
        is outside the scope of this document.
</p>
<p>As described in <a class='info' href='#SeFECBB'>Section&nbsp;2.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>FEC building block</span><span>)</span></a>, a receiver MUST
        obtain the required FEC Object Transmission Information for each
        object for which the receiver receives and processes packets.
</p>
<p>Upon receipt of each packet the receiver proceeds with the
        following steps in the order listed.
</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>The receiver MUST parse the packet header and verify that it is
            a valid header. If it is not valid then the packet MUST be
            discarded without further processing.
</li>
<li>The receiver MUST verify that the sender IP address together
            with the TSI carried in the header matches one of the (sender IP
            address, TSI) pairs that was received in a Session Description and
            that the receiver is currently joined to. If there is not a match
            then the packet MUST be silently discarded without further
            processing. The remaining steps are performed within the scope of
            the (sender IP address, TSI) session of the received packet.
</li>
<li>The receiver MUST process and act on the CCI field in
            accordance with the multiple rate congestion control building
            block.
</li>
<li>If more than one object is carried in the session, the receiver
            MUST verify that the TOI carried in the LCT header is valid. If
            the TOI is not valid, the packet MUST be discarded without further
            processing.
</li>
<li>The receiver SHOULD process the remainder of the packet,
            including interpreting the other header fields appropriately, and
            using the FEC Payload ID and the encoding symbol(s) in the payload
            to reconstruct the corresponding object.
</li>
</ol>

<p>It is RECOMMENDED that packet authentication be used. If packet
        authentication is used then it is RECOMMENDED that the receiver
        immediately check the authenticity of a packet before proceeding with
        step (3) above. If immediate checking is possible and if the packet
        fails the check then the receiver MUST silently discard the
        packet.
</p>
<p>Some packet authentication schemes such as TESLA <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-msec-tesla-for-alc-norm'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;msec&#8209;tesla&#8209;for&#8209;alc&#8209;norm]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Roca, V., Francillon, A., and S. Faurite, &ldquo;Use of TESLA in the ALC and NORM Protocols,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> do not allow an
        immediate authenticity check. In this case the receiver SHOULD check
        the authenticity of a packet as soon as possible, and if the packet
        fails the check then it MUST be silently discarded before step (5)
        above. It is RECOMMENDED that if receivers detect many packets which
        fail authentication checks within a session then the above procedure
        should be modified for this session so that Step 3 is delayed until
        after the authentication check and only performed if the check
        succeeds.

<a name="rfc.section.5"></a><h3>5.&nbsp;
Security Considerations</h3>

<p>The same security consideration that apply to the LCT, FEC and the
      multiple rate congestion control building blocks also apply to ALC.
</p>
<p>ALC is especially vulnerable to denial- of-service attacks by
      attackers that try to send forged packets to the session which would
      prevent successful reconstruction or cause inaccurate reconstruction of
      large portions of the object by receivers. ALC is also particularly
      affected by such an attack because many receivers may receive the same
      forged packet. There are two ways to protect against such attacks, one
      at the application level and one at the packet level. It is RECOMMENDED
      that prevention be provided at both levels.
</p>
<p>At the application level, it is RECOMMENDED that an integrity check
      on the entire received object be done once the object is reconstructed
      to ensure it is the same as the sent object. Moreover, in order to
      obtain strong cryptographic integrity protection a digital signature
      verifiable by the receiver SHOULD be used to provide this application
      level integrity check. However, if even one corrupted or forged packet
      is used to reconstruct the object, it is likely that the received object
      will be reconstructed incorrectly. This will appropriately cause the
      integrity check to fail and in this case the inaccurately reconstructed
      object SHOULD be discarded. Thus, the acceptance of a single forged
      packet can be an effective denial of service attack for distributing
      objects, but an object integrity check at least prevents inadvertent use
      of inaccurately reconstructed objects. The specification of an
      application level integrity check of the received object is outside the
      scope of this document.
</p>
<p>At the packet level, it is RECOMMENDED that a packet level
      authentication be used to ensure that each received packet is an
      authentic and uncorrupted packet containing data for the object arriving
      from the specified sender. Packet level authentication has the advantage
      that corrupt or forged packets can be discarded individually and the
      received authenticated packets can be used to accurately reconstruct the
      object. Thus, the effect of a denial of service attack that injects
      forged packets is proportional only to the number of forged packets, and
      not to the object size. <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-rmt-simple-auth-for-alc-norm'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;rmt&#8209;simple&#8209;auth&#8209;for&#8209;alc&#8209;norm]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Roca, V., &ldquo;Simple Authentication Schemes for the ALC and NORM Protocols,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a><a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-msec-tesla-for-alc-norm'>and<span> (</span><span class='info'>Roca, V., Francillon, A., and S. Faurite, &ldquo;Use of TESLA in the ALC and NORM Protocols,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> [I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;msec&#8209;tesla&#8209;for&#8209;alc&#8209;norm] described packet
      level authentication schemes which can be used with the ALC
      protocol.
</p>
<p>In addition to providing protection against reconstruction of
      inaccurate objects, packet level authentication can also provide some
      protection against denial of service attacks on the multiple rate
      congestion control. Attackers can try to inject forged packets with
      incorrect congestion control information into the multicast stream,
      thereby potentially adversely affecting network elements and receivers
      downstream of the attack, and much less significantly the rest of the
      network and other receivers. Thus, it is also RECOMMENDED that packet
      level authentication be used to protect against such attacks. TESLA
      <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-msec-tesla-for-alc-norm'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;msec&#8209;tesla&#8209;for&#8209;alc&#8209;norm]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Roca, V., Francillon, A., and S. Faurite, &ldquo;Use of TESLA in the ALC and NORM Protocols,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> can also be used
      to some extent to limit the damage caused by such attacks. However, with
      TESLA a receiver can only determine if a packet is authentic several
      seconds after it is received, and thus an attack against the congestion
      control protocol can be effective for several seconds before the
      receiver can react to slow down the session reception rate.
</p>
<p>Reverse Path Forwarding checks SHOULD be enabled in all network
      routers and switches along the path from the sender to receivers to
      limit the possibility of a bad agent injecting forged packets into the
      multicast tree data path.

Baseline Secure ALC Operation</h3>

<p>This section describes a baseline mode of secure ALC protocol
        operation based on application of the IPsec security protocol. This
        approach is documented here to provide a reference, interoperable
        secure mode of operation. However, additional approaches to ALC
        security, including other forms of IPsec application, MAY be specified
        in the future. For example, the use of the EXT_AUTH header extension
        could enable ALC-specific authentication or security encapsulation
        headers similar to those of IPsec to be specified and inserted into
        the ALC/LCT protocol message headers. This would allow header
        compression techniques to be applied to IP and ALC protocol headers
        when needed in a similar fashion to that of RTP <a class='info' href='#RFC3550'>[RFC3550]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schulzrinne, H., Casner, S., Frederick, R., and V. Jacobson, &ldquo;RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a> and as preserved in the specification for
        Secure Real Time Protocol (SRTP) <a class='info' href='#RFC3711'>[RFC3711]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Baugher, M., McGrew, D., Naslund, M., Carrara, E., and K. Norrman, &ldquo;The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP),&rdquo; March&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>The baseline approach described is applicable to ALC operation
        configured for SSM (or SSM-like) operation where there is a single
        sender. The receiver set would maintain a single IPSec Security
        Association (SA) for each ALC sender.

<a name="rfc.section.5.1.1"></a><h3>5.1.1.&nbsp;
IPsec Approach</h3>

<p>To support this baseline form of secure ALC one-to-many SSM
          operation, each node SHALL be configured with a transport mode IPsec
          Security Association and corresponding Security Policy Database
          (SPD) entry. This entry will be used for sender-to-group multicast
          packet authentication and optionally encryption.
</p>
<p>The ALC sender SHALL use an IPsec SA configured for ESP protocol
          <a class='info' href='#RFC4303'>[RFC4303]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kent, S., &ldquo;IP Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP),&rdquo; December&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> operation with the option for data
          origination authentication enabled. It is also RECOMMENDED that this
          IPsec ESP SA be also configured to provide confidentiality
          protection for IP packets containing ALC protocol messages. This is
          suggested to make the realization of complex replay attacks much
          more difficult. The encryption key for this SA SHALL be preplaced at
          the sender and receiver(s) prior to ALC protocol operation. Use of
          automated key management is RECOMMENDED as a rekey SHALL be required
          prior to expiration of the sequence space for the SA. This is
          necessary so that receivers may use the built-in IPsec replay attack
          protection possible for an IPsec SA with a single source (the ALC
          sender). Thus the receivers SHALL enable replay attack protection
          for this SA used to secure ALC sender traffic. The sender IPsec SPD
          entry MUST be configured to process outbound packets to the
          destination address and UDP port number of the applicable ALC
          session.
</p>
<p>The ALC receiver(s) MUST be configured with the SA and SPD entry
          to properly process the IPsec-secured packets from the sender. Note
          that use of ESP confidentiality, as RECOMMENDED, for secure ALC
          protocol operation makes it more difficult for adversaries to
          conduct effective replay attacks that may mislead receivers on
          content reception. This baseline approach can be used for ALC
          protocol sessions with multiple senders if a distinct SA is
          established for each sender.
</p>
<p>It is anticipated in early deployments of this baseline approach
          to ALC security that key management will be conducted out-of-band
          with respect to ALC protocol operation. For ALC unidirectional
          operation, it is possible that receivers may retrieve keying
          information from a central server via out-of-band (with respect to
          ALC) communication as needed or otherwise conduct group key updates
          with a similar centralized approach. However, it may be possible
          with some key management schemes for rekey messages to be
          transmitted to the group as a message or transport object within the
          ALC reliable transfer session. Additional specification is necessary
          to define an in-band key management scheme for ALC sessions perhaps
          using the mechanisms of the automated group key management
          specifications cited in this document.

<p>The IPsec requirements profile outlined here is commonly

            typically configured with the privileges necessary to effect
