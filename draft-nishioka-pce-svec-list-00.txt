Abstract 
   
   A Path Computation Element (PCE) performing dependent path 
   computations, for instance calculating a diverse working and 
   protected path do not share common network points, would need to
   synchronize the computations in order to increase the probability 
   of meeting the working and protected path disjoint objective.
   This document describes the usage of multiple Synchronization
   VECtors (SVECs) in the SVEC list. When a PCE computes multiple sets 
   of dependent path computation requests, it is required to use SVEC 
   list for association among the sets of dependent path computation
   requests. The aim of this document is to define the association 
   among SVECs and its processing rule.

1. Terminology 
 
   Terminology used in this document:  
    
      PCC: Path Computation Client: Any client application requesting a  
      path computation to be performed by a Path Computation Element.  
 
      PCE: Path Computation Element: An entity (component, application,  
      or network node) that is capable of computing a network path or  
      route based on a network graph, and applying computational  
      constraints. 
    
      PCEP Peer: an element involved in a PCEP session (i.e. a PCC or a
      PCE).

2. Introduction 

   [ID.pce-pcep] describes the specifications for PCEP (Path Computation 
   Element communication Protocol). PCEP facilitates the communication 
   between a Path Computation Client(PCC) and a Path Computation Element
   (PCE), or between two PCEs based on PCE architecture [RFC4655]. PCEP
   interactions include path computation requests and path computation 
   replies.

   PCEP supports the synchronous and dependent path computation 
   Requests required in [RFC4657], when a PCC or PCE sends path 
   computation requests to a PCE. For requesting the synchronous 
   and dependent path computation, SVEC Synchronization VECtor (SVEC) 
   allows the PCC or PCE to specify a list of multiple path 
   computation requests that must be synchronized along with a 
   potential dependency.

   [ID.pce-pcep] defines two synchronous path computation modes using 
   SVEC.

     o  Bundle of a set of independent and synchronized path computation
        requests,
     o  Bundle of a set of dependent and synchronized path computation
        requests.

   These are exclusive modes. If one of the dependency flags (i.e.  
   Node, Link or Shared Risk Link Groups (SRLG) diverse flags) in a 
   SVEC is set, the SVEC indicates a set of synchronous path 
   computation requests with a dependency. In order to be synchronized 
   among multiple sets of path computation requests with a dependency, 
   it is necessary to use other SVECs.

   It is important for the PCE, when performing path optimizations, to
   synchronize the multiple sets of path computation requests with a
   dependency. For example, consider that two diverse sets of path
   computation requests are computed for end-to-end path protection/
   restoration. If they are computed sequentially, the first set of 
   requests may give negative impacts on the second set of requests.

   This document defines the synchronous path computation for the 
   multiple sets of path computation requests with dependencies below.

   o  Bundle of multiple sets of dependent and synchronized path    
      computation requests that must be synchronized.
   
   This document describes the association among multiple SVECs and its 
   processing rules to support multiple set of dependent path 
   computation requests to be synchronized.

   The SVEC association and its processing rule do not require any 
   extension on PCEP message and object formats. In addition, the use 
   of multiple SVEC does not restrict to SRLG, Node and Link diversity
   currently defined in the SVEC object, [ID.pce-pcep], but is also
   available for other dependent path computation requests.

   In this version of the document, the problem the authors describe is 
   limited to single PCE and single domain synchronized path 
   computation. In a future version of this document there will be 
   an analysis of multi-PCE and multi-Domain synchronized path 
   computations. 


3. Association among SVECs
 
    This section describes the associations among SVECs in a SVEC list. 

3.1 Associated SVECs

   Associated SVECs mean that there are relationships among multiple 
   SVECs. Request-IDs in the SVEC objects are used to indicate the 
   association among SVEC objects. If the same request-IDs exist in 
   more than two SVECs, this indicates associated SVECs. 
   When associating among SVECs, only one request-ID may in the SVEC
   object may be contained in the other SVEC object. This contributes 
   to reduce the message size of PCEP request. Even in this case, all 
   of the path computation requests are synchronized.

   Below is an example of associated SVECs. In this example the first 
   SVEC and the other SVECs are associated, and path computation 
   requests from Request-ID#1 to Request-ID#Z must be synchronized.

Internet-Draft      draft-nishioka-pce-svec-list-00.txt       July 2007 


   <SVEC-list>
       <SVEC> without dependency flags
          Request-ID #1, Request-ID #3, Request-ID #4... , Request-ID #X

       <SVEC> with one or more dependency flags 
          Request-ID #1, Request-ID #2

       <SVEC> with one or more dependency flags
          Request-ID #4, Request-ID #5
       ........

       <SVEC> without dependency flag
          Request-ID #X, Request-ID #Y, Request-ID #Z

   Note here path computation requests that do not have other SVECs, 
   like Request-ID #3, may be contained in the associated SVEC. 
   This request is also synchronized.


3.2 Non-associated SVECs

   Non-associated SVECs mean that there are no relationships among 
   SVECs. If SVEC objects in PECP request messages do not have the 
   same request-ID, the relationship among these SVECs is not 
   associated. Below is an example of non-associated SVECs that does 
   not contain any same request-IDs.


   <SVEC-list>
       <SVEC> with one or more dependency flags 
             Request-ID #1, Request-ID #2

       <SVEC> with one or more dependency flags
             Request-ID #4, Request-ID #5
       ........

       <SVEC> without dependency flags
           Request-ID #X, Request-ID #Y, Request-ID #Z

4. Processing of SVEC list

   When PCEP receives PCReq messages with more than two SVEC objects 
   in the SVEC list, PCEP MUST check request-IDs in all SVEC objects 
   firstly, to obtain the association among them.

   The SVEC objects MAY be received in a single or multiple PCReq 
   message(s). In the later case, PCE start SynTimer as defined in 
   [ID.pce-pcep]. After receiving the whole path computation requests, 
   the analysis for associated SVECs MUST be started.

   If there are no same request-IDs in the different SVEC objects, these 
   SVEC objects are not associated, and then each set of path 
   computation requests in the non-associated SVEC objects MUST be 
   computed separately. 

   If there are the same request-IDs in the different SVEC objects, 
   these SVEC objects are associated, and then all path computation 
   requests in the associated SVEC objects MUST be computed with 
   synchronous manner.


4. Manageability considerations

   This document does not describe any specific protocol extensions to 
   PCEP. Other manageability considerations specified in 
   [ID.pce-mngabl-reqs] still need to be discussed, and any 
   requirements will be included in future versions of this document.


5.  Security Considerations

   This document defines the usage of SVEC list, and does not have any
   extensions for PCEP protocol. Therefore the security of this document 
   depends on that of PCEP protocol.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not describe any specific protocol extensions to 
   PCEP and not require any registry assignment.
