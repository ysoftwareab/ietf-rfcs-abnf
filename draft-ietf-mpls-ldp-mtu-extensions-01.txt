Internet Draft      MTU Signalling Extensions for LDP          June 2003


Abstract

   Proper functioning of RFC 1191 path MTU discovery requires that IP
   routers have knowledge of the MTU for each link to which they are
   connected.  As currently specified, the Label Distribution Protocol
   (LDP) does not have the ability to signal the MTU for a Label
   Switched Path (LSP) to the ingress Label Switching Router (LSR).  In
   the absence of this functionality, the MTU for each LSP must be
   statically configured by network operators or by equivalent, off-line
   mechanisms.

   This document specifies extensions to LDP in support of LSP MTU
   discovery.


Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [1].


1. Introduction

   As currently specified in [2], the LDP protocol for MPLS does not
   support signalling of the MTU for LSPs to ingress LSRs.  This
   functionality is essential to the proper functioning of RFC 1191 path
   MTU detection [3].  Without knowledge of the MTU for an LSP, edge
   LSRs may transmit packets along that LSP which are, according to [4],
   too big.  Such packets may be silently discarded by LSRs along the
   LSP, effectively preventing communication between certain end hosts.

   The solution proposed in this document enables automatic
   determination of the MTU for an LSP with the addition of a TLV to
   carry MTU information for a FEC between adjacent LSRs in LDP Label
   Mapping messages.  This information is sufficient for a set of LSRs
   along the path followed by an LSP to discover either the exact MTU
   for that LSP, or an approximation which is no worse than could be
   generated with local information on the ingress LSR.

1.1. Changes from last version

   The biggest change, protocol-wise is that the notion of 'egress'
   interface has been removed.  The LSP MTU at the egress is now 65535.
   This has repurcussions on the processing of the MTU TLV.  Also, the
   MTU TLV now has both the U and F bits set.

   A number of definitions have been introduced to clarify the

   exposition.  Also, the examples have been changed significantly.


2. MTU Signalling

   The signalling procedure described in this document employs the
   addition of a single TLV to LDP Label Mapping messages and a simple
   algorithm for LSP MTU calculation.

2.1. Definitions

   Link MTU: the MTU of a given link.  This size includes the IP header
   and data (or other payload) and the label stack, but does not include
   any lower-level headers.  A link may be an interface (such as
   Ethernet or Packet-over-SONET), a tunnel (such as GRE or IPsec) or an
   LSP.

   Peer LSRs: for LSR A and FEC F, this is the set of LSRs that sent a
   Label Mapping for FEC F to A.

   Downstream LSRs: for LSR A and FEC F, this is the subset of A's peer
   LSRs for FEC F to whom A will forward packets for the FEC.
   Typically, this subset is determined via the routing table.

   Hop MTU: the MTU of an LSP hop between an upstream LSR A and a
   downstream LSR B.  This size includes the IP header and data (or
   other payload) and the part of the label stack that is considered
   payload as far as this LSP goes.  It does not include any lower-level
   headers.  (Note: if there are multiple links between A and B, the Hop
   MTU is the minimum of the MTU of those links used for forwarding.)

   LSP MTU: the MTU of an LSP from a given LSR to the egress(es), over
   each valid (forwarding) path.  This size includes the IP header and
   data (or other payload) and any part of the label stack that was
   received by the ingress LSR before it placed the packet into the LSP
   (this part of the label stack is considered part of the payload for
   this LSP).  The size does not include any lower-level headers.

2.2. Example

   Consider LSRs A-F interconnected as follows:

                 M       P
               _____ C =====
              /      |      \
     A ~~~~~ B ===== D ----- E ----- F
         L       N       Q       R

Internet Draft      MTU Signalling Extensions for LDP          June 2003


   Say that the link MTU for link L is 9216, for links M, Q and R is
   4470, and for N and P is 1500.

   Consider a FEC X for which F is the egress, and say that all LSRs
   advertise X to their neighbors.

   C's peers for FEC X are B, D and E.  Say C chooses E as its
   downstream LSR for X.  Similarly, A chooses B, B chooses C and D, D
   chooses E and E chooses F (respectively) as their downstream LSRs.

   C's Hop MTU to E for FEC X is 1496.  B's Hop MTU to C is 4466, and to
   D is 1496.  A's LSP MTU for FEC X is 1496.  If A has another LSP for
   FEC Y to F (learned via targetted LDP) that rides over the LSP for
   FEC X, the MTU for that LSP would be 1492.

   If B had a targetted LDP session to E over which B received a Mapping
   for FEC X, then E would also be B's peer, and E may be chosen as a
   downstream LSR for B.

   This memo describes how A determines its LSP MTU for FEC X and Y.

2.3. Signalling Procedure

   The procedure for signalling the MTU is performed hop-by-hop by each
   LSR L along an LSP for a given FEC F.  The steps are as follows:

   1.  First, L computes the its LSP MTU for FEC F:

       A.  If L is the egress for F, L sets the LSP MTU for F to 65535.

       B.  If L is not the egress LSR, L computes the LSP MTU for F as
           follows:

           a)  L determines its downstream neighbors for FEC F.

           b)  For each downstream neighbor Z, L computes the minimum of
               the Hop MTU to Z and the LSP MTU in the MTU TLV that Z
               advertised to L.  If Z did not include the MTU TLV in its
               Label Mapping, then Z's LSP MTU is set to 65535.

           c)  L sets its LSP MTU to the minimum of the MTUs it computed
               for its downstream neighbors.

   2.  For each LDP neighbor (direct or targetted) of L to which L
       decides to send a Mapping for FEC F, L attaches an MTU TLV with
       the MTU that it computed for this FEC.  L MAY (because of policy
       or other reasons) advertise a smaller MTU than it has computed,
       but L MUST NOT advertise a larger MTU.

Internet Draft      MTU Signalling Extensions for LDP          June 2003


   3.  When a new MTU is received for FEC F from a downstream LSR, or
       the set of downstream LSRs for F changes, L returns to Step 1.
       If the newly computed LSP MTU is unchanged, L SHOULD NOT
       advertise new information to its neighbors.  Otherwise, L
       readvertises its Mappings for F to all its peers with an updated
       MTU TLV.

       This behavior is standard for attributes such as path vector and
       hop count, and the same rules apply, as specified in [2].

       If the LSP MTU decreases, L SHOULD readvertise the new MTU
       immediately; if the LSP MTU increases, L MAY hold down the
       readvertisement.

2.4. MTU TLV

   The MTU TLV encodes information on the maximum transmission unit for
   an LSP, from the advertising LSR to the egress(es) over all valid
   paths.

   The encoding for the MTU TLV is:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |1|1|      MTU TLV (0x0XXX)     |            Length             |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |              MTU              |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   MTU

   This is a 16-bit unsigned integer that represents the MTU in octets
   for an LSP or segment of an LSP.

   Note that the U and F bits are set.  An LSR that doesn't recognize
   the MTU TLV MUST ignore it when it processes the Label Mapping
   message, and forward the TLV to its peers.  This may result in the
   incorrect computation of the LSP MTU; however, silently forwarding
   the MTU TLV preserves maximal amount of information about the LSP
   MTU.

3. Example of Operation

   Consider the example network in section 2.2.  The following table
   describes, for each LSR, the links to its downstream LSRs, the Hop
   MTU for the peer, the LSP MTU received from the peer, and the LSR's
   computed LSP MTU.

        LSR  |  Link  |  Hop MTU  |  Recvd MTU  |  LSP MTU
        --------------------------------------------------
         F   |    -   |    65535  |      -      |    65535
        --------------------------------------------------
         E   |    R   |     4466  |  F:  65535  |     4466
        --------------------------------------------------
         D   |    Q   |     4466  |  E:   4466  |     4466
        --------------------------------------------------
         C   |    P   |     1496  |  E:   4466  |     1496
        --------------------------------------------------
         B   |    M   |     4466  |  C:   1496  |
             |    N   |     1496  |  D:   4466  |     1496
        --------------------------------------------------
         A   |    L   |     9212  |  B:   1496  |     1496
        --------------------------------------------------

   Now consider the same network with the following changes: there is an
   LSP X from B to E, and a targetted LDP session from B to E.  B's peer
   LSRs are A, C, D and E; B's downstream LSRs are D and E; to reach E,
   B chooses to go over X.  The LSP MTU for LSP X is 1496.

        LSR  |  Link  |  Hop MTU  |  Recvd MTU  |  LSP MTU
        --------------------------------------------------
         F   |    -   |    65535  |      -      |    65535
        --------------------------------------------------
         E   |    R   |     4466  |  F:  65535  |     4466
        --------------------------------------------------
         D   |    Q   |     4466  |  E:   4466  |     4466
        --------------------------------------------------
         C   |    P   |     1496  |  E:   4466  |     1496
        --------------------------------------------------
         B   |    X   |     1492  |  E:   4466  |
             |    N   |     1496  |  D:   4466  |     1492
        --------------------------------------------------
         A   |    L   |     9212  |  B:   1492  |     1492
        --------------------------------------------------

4. Using the LSP MTU

   An ingress LSR that forwards an IP packet into an LSP whose MTU it
   knows MUST either fragment the IP packet to the LSP's MTU (if the
   Don't Fragment bit is clear) or drop the packet and respond with an
   ICMP Destination Unreachable message to the source of the packet,
   with the Code indicating "fragmentation needed and DF set", and the
   Next-Hop MTU set to the LSP MTU.  In other words, the LSR behaves as
   RFC 1191 says, except it treats the LSP as the next hop "network".

   If the payload for the LSP is not an IP packet, the LSR MUST forward
   the packet if it fits (size <= LSP MTU), and SHOULD drop it if it
   doesn't fit.


5. Protocol Interaction

5.1. Interaction With LSRs Which Do Not Support MTU Signalling

   Changes in MTU for sections of an LSP may cause intermediate LSRs to
   generate unsolicited label Mapping messages to advertise the new MTU.
   LSRs which do not support MTU signalling MUST accept these messages,
   but MAY ignore them (see Section 2.1).

5.2. Interaction with CR-LDP and RSVP-TE

   The MTU TLV can be used to discover the Path MTU of both LDP LSPs and
   CR-LDP LSPs.  This proposal is not impacted in the presence of LSPs
   created using CR-LDP, as specified in [5].

   Note that LDP/CR-LDP LSPs may tunnel through other LSPs signalled
   using LDP, CR-LDP or RSVP-TE [6]; the mechanism suggested here
   applies in all these cases, essentially by treating the tunnel LSPs
   as links.

Security Considerations

   This mechanism does not introduce any new weaknesses in LDP.  It is
   possible to spoof TCP packets belonging to an LDP session to
   manipulate the LSP MTU, but this sort of attack is not new to LDP.


IANA Considerations

   A new LDP TLV Type is defined in section 2.4.  A Type has to be
   allocated by IANA; a number from the range 0x0000 - 0x3DFF is
   requested.
