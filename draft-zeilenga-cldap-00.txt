Abstract

  This note discusses the moving the Connection-less Lightweight
  Directory Access Protocol [CLDAP] to Historical status.

Background

  Connection-less Lightweight Directory Access Protocol [CLDAP] was
  published over six years ago as a Proposed Standard.  The protocol was
  targeted at applications which require lookup of small amounts of
  information held in the directory.  The protocol avoids the overhead
  of establishing (and closing) a connection and the session bind and
  unbind operations needed in connection-oriented directory access
  protocols such as LDAP [LDAPv2].

  CLDAP is not widely deployed on the Internet.  While there are few
  implementations which reportedly implement CLDAP, conformance to the
  specification as well as interoperability of any independently
  developed implementations is unknown.

  It is believed that CLDAP would have to be significantly updated
  before it could be advanced on the standard track.  In particular,
  CLDAP is based upon deprecated syntaxes and semantics of LDAPv2
  [LDAPv2].  The community has widely adopted LDAPv3 [LDAPv3].

  While there is some interest in developing connection-less LDAP
  protocols, current work [LDAPUDP] is of an experimental nature.


Recommendation

  Due to the lack of independently developed interoperable
  implementations, the lack of wide deployment, and current work to
  engineer protocol supporting LDAPv3 features, CLDAP should not be
  viewed as generally applicable for use on the Internet.  It is
  recommended that RFC 1798 be moved to Historical status.


Security Considerations

  The security of the Internet will not be impacted by the retirement of
  CLDAP.


Acknowledgment

  The author would like to thank the designers of CLDAP for their
  contribution to the Internet community.
