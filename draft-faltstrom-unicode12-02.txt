Abstract

   This document describes the changes between Unicode 6.2.0 and Unicode
   12.0.0 in the context of IDNA2008.  Some additions and changes have
   been made in the Unicode Standard that affect the values produced by
   the algorithm IDNA2008 specifies.  IDNA2008 allows adding exceptions
   to the algorithm for backward compatibility; however, this document
   does not add any such exceptions.  This document provides the
   necessary tables to IANA to make its database consisstent with
   Unicode 12.0.0.

   To improve understanding, this document describes systems that are
   being used as alternatives to those that conform to IDNA2008.

   TO BE REMOVED AT TIME OF PUBLICATION AS AN RFC:

   This document is discussed on the i18n-discuss@ietf.org mailing list
   of the IETF.

1.  Introduction

   The current version of Internationalized Domain Names for
   Applications (IDNA) was initiated in 2008, and despite not being
   completed until 2010, is widely known as "IDNA2008".  It is specified

Internet-Draft           IDNA2008 and Unicode 12              March 2021


   in the series of documents listed in Section 2.1.  The IDNA2008
   standard includes an algorithm by which a derived property value is
   calculated based on the properties defined from the Unicode Standard.

   The derived property values that can be calculated are defined in RFC
   5892 [RFC5892].  The summary below is a summary to make the reading
   of this document easier.  For definition of the terms, please see RFC
   5892 [RFC5892].

   o  PROTOCOL VALID: Those that are allowed to be used in IDNs.  Code
      points with this property value are permitted for general use in
      IDNs.  However, that a label consists only of code points that
      have this property value does not imply that the label can be used
      in DNS.  The abbreviated term PVALID is used to refer to this
      value.

   o  CONTEXTUAL RULE REQUIRED: Some characteristics of the character,
      such as it being invisible in certain contexts or problematic in
      others, require that it not be used in labels unless specific
      other characters or properties are present.  The abbreviated term
      CONTEXT is used to refer to this value.

   o  DISALLOWED: Those that should clearly not be included in IDNs.
      Code points with this property value are not permitted in IDNs.

   o  UNASSIGNED: Those code points that are not designated (i.e., are
      unassigned) in the Unicode Standard.

   When the Unicode Standard is updated, new code points are assigned
   and already-assigned code points can have their property values
   changed.

   o  Assigning code points can create problems if the newly-assigned
      code points are compositions of existing code points and because
      of that the normalization relationships associated with those code
      points should have been changed.

   o  Changing properties for already-assigned code points can create
      problems if the property change results in changes to the derived
      property value.  This might make an earlier allowed code point
      whose derived property value is PVALID to then not be allowed
      anymore if its derived property value changes to DISALLOWED.  The
      problem can also happen the other way around: a code point that
      was not allowed (and thus is prohibited) can suddenly end up being
      allowed.

   o  Problems can also be created if the properties assigned to those
      code points are inconsistent with IDNA2008 assumptions about how

      properties are assigned and/or about how code points with those
      properties are used or behave.

   There were three incompatible changes in the Unicode standard after
   Unicode 5.2.0 [Unicode-5.2.0] up to including Unicode 6.0.0
   [Unicode-6.0.0], as described in RFC 6452 [RFC6452].  The code points
   U+0CF1 and U+0CF2 had a derived property value change from DISALLOWED
   to PVALID while U+19DA had a change in derived property value from
   PVALID to DISALLOWED.  They were examined in great detail and IETF
   concluded that the consensus is that no update was needed to RFC 5892
   [RFC5892] based on the changes made to the Unicode standard.

   As described in Section 3, more changes have been made to code points
   between Unicode version 6.0.0 and Unicode version 12.0.0
   [Unicode-12.0.0] so that the derived property values have been
   changed in an incompatible way.  This document concludes that no
   exceptions are to be added to RFC 5892 [RFC5892] even though there
   are changes in the derived property value as a result of the changes
   made in Unicode between version 6.2.0 and 12.0.0.

   Further, in 2015, the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) issued a
   statement [IAB] which requested the IETF to resolve the issues
   related to the code point ARABIC LETTER BEH WITH HAMZA ABOVE (U+08A1)
   that was introduced in Unicode 7.0.0 [Unicode-7.0.0].  This document
   concludes that this code point is not to be added to the exception
   list either.  It should be noted that the review on U+08A1 indicated
   that it is not an isolated case and that a number of PVALID code
   points of long standing may have similar issues.  The problem
   resulted in a clarification of the review process of new Unicode
   versions RFC 8753 [RFC8753].  This clarification of the review
   process will impact review of Unicode versions after version 12.0.0.

2.  Background

2.1.  IDNA2008 Documents

   IDNA2008 consists of the following documents.  The documents in the
   set have informal names.

   o  Internationalized Domain Names for Applications (IDNA):
      Definitions and Document Framework [RFC5890], informally called
      "Defs" or "Definitions", contains definitions and other material
      that are needed for understanding other documents in the set.

   o  Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA): Protocol
      [RFC5891], informally called "Protocol", describes the core
      IDNA2008 protocol and its operations.  It needs to be interpreted
      in combination with the Bidi document (described below).

Internet-Draft           IDNA2008 and Unicode 12              March 2021


   o  The Unicode Code Points and Internationalized Domain Names for
      Applications (IDNA) [RFC5892], informally called "Tables", lists
      the categories and rules that identify the code points allowed in
      a label written in native character form (called a "U-label"), and
      is based on Unicode 5.2.0 [Unicode-5.2.0] code point assignments
      and additional rules unique to IDNA2008.  The Unicode-based rules
      in RFC 4892 are expected to be stable across Unicode updates and
      hence independent of Unicode versions.  RFC 5892 [RFC5892]
      obsoletes RFC 3491 [RFC3491], and in particular the use of the
      tables to which RFC 3491 [RFC3491] refers.

   o  Right-to-Left Scripts for Internationalized Domain Names for
      Applications (IDNA) [RFC5893], informally called "Bidi", specifies
      special rules for labels that contain characters that are written
      from right to left.

   o  Internationalized Domain Names for Applications (IDNA):
      Background, Explanation, and Rationale [RFC5894], informally
      called "Rationale", provides an overview of the protocol and
      associated tables, and gives explanatory material and some
      rationale for the decisions that led to IDNA2008.  It also
      contains advice for DNS registry operators and others who use
      Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs).

   o  Mapping Characters for Internationalized Domain Names in
      Applications (IDNA) 2008 [RFC5895], informally called "Mapping",
      discusses the issue of mapping characters into other characters
      and provides guidance for doing so when that is appropriate.  RFC
      5895 provides advice only and is not a required part of IDNA.

2.2.  Additional important IDNA2008-related documents

   There are other documents important for the understanding and
   functioning of IDNA2008, for example this.

   o  The Unicode Code Points and Internationalized Domain Names for
      Applications (IDNA) - Unicode 6.0 [RFC6452] describes some changes
      made to Unicode 6.0.0 [Unicode-6.0.0] that resulted in derived
      property value change for the code points U+0CF1, U+0CF2 and
      U+19DA.  U+0CF1 and U+0CF2 changed from DISALLOWED to PVALID,
      while U+19DA changed from PVALID to DISALLOWED.  The IETF
      concluded that no update to RFC 5892 [RFC5892] was needed based on
      the changes made in Unicode 6.0.0 [Unicode-6.0.0].  As a result,
      the derived property value remained aligned with the Unicode
      Standard.  Specifically, no exception was added.

2.3.  Deployment

   There are many variations on the general IDNA model in use in the
   various parts of the community.  The following lists some of the
   strategies that implementations that claim to be IDNA compliant are
   known to use, but it should be noted the list is not complete:

   o  IDNA2003 as specified in RFC 3490 [RFC3490] and RFC 3491
      [RFC3491].  Those specifications are dependent on case folding and
      NFKC normalization and on tables that specify for each code point
      whether it is allowed to be used or not, with a distinction made
      between use for "stored strings" and "query strings".  The tables
      themselves are dependent on version 3.2 of The Unicode Standard
      [Unicode-3.2.0].

   o  A number of variations on IDNA2003, sometimes presented as
      "updated IDNA2003" or the like, which follow the principles of
      IDNA2003 as understood by the implementers but that use tables
      that represent how the implementers believe Stringprep [RFC3454]
      and Nameprep [RFC3491] would have evolved had the IETF not moved
      in the direction of IDNA2008 instead.

   o  A mix between IDNA2003 and IDNA2008 where code points assigned to
      Unicode after Unicode 3.2.0 [Unicode-3.2.0] have derived property
      value calculated according to the algorithm specified in IDNA2008.

   o  A mix between IDNA2003 and IDNA2008 according to the Unicode
      Technical Standard #46 [UTS-46].  Because that document specifies
      different profiles, there are several different variations that
      leave users with no guarantee that two applications claiming
      conformance to UTS#46 will interoperate well with each other much
      less with conforming IDNA2008 implementations.  UTS#46 is
      ultimately based on a normative table very much like the one used
      by Stringprep [RFC3454] but updated for each new version of
      Unicode.

   o  The (normative) IDNA2008 algorithm applied to whatever version of
      Unicode Standard exists in the operating system and/or libraries
      used, independent of whatever version of tables appears in the
      (non-normative) IANA database.

   In practice, the Unicode Consortium creates a maximum set of code
   points by assigning code points in the Unicode Standard.  The
   IDNA2008 rules use the Unicode Standard to create a further subset of
   code points and context that are permitted in DNS labels associated
   with its PVALID, CONTEXTJ, and CONTEXTO derived property values.  DNS
   registries and other organizations that deal with IDNs are supposed

Internet-Draft           IDNA2008 and Unicode 12              March 2021


   to create their own subsets from IDNA2008 for use by those registries
   and organizations.

   This progressive subsetting and narrowing of the repertoire of code
   points that can be used in labels is an implementation of the
   principles of being conservative when deciding what code points to
   include in such a subset.  SAC-084 [SAC-084] and RFC 6912 [RFC6912]
   recommend to DNS registries and other organizations to be
   conservative when creating their subsets, and to use the principle of
   creating subsets by inclusion.

3.  Notable Changes Between Unicode 6.2.0 and 12.0.0

3.1.  Changes between Unicode 6.2.0 and 7.0.0

      Change in number of characters in each category:

      Code points that changed derived property value: 0

      PVALID changed from 97946 to 99867 (+1921)

      UNASSIGNED changed from 864348 to 861509 (-2839)

      CONTEXTJ did not change, at 2

      CONTEXTO did not change, at 25

      DISALLOWED changed from 151791 to 152709 (+918)

      TOTAL did not change, at 1114112

      There are no changes made to Unicode between version 6.2.0 and
      7.0.0 that impact IDNA2008 calculation of the derived property
      values.

   The character ARABIC LETTER BEH WITH HAMZA ABOVE (U+08A1) was
   introduced in Unicode 7.0.0.  This was discussed extensively in the
   IETF, and by the IAB in their statement [IAB] requesting the IETF to
   investigate the issue.  Specifically, the IAB stated:

      On the same precautionary principle, the IAB recommends that the
      Internationalized Domain Names for Applications (IDNA) Parameters
      registry (http://www.iana.org/assignments/idna-tables/) not be
      updated to Unicode 7.0.0 until the IETF has consensus on a
      solution to this problem.

   The discussion in the IETF concluded that although it is possible to
   create "the same" character in multiple ways, the issue with U+08A1



Faltstrom              Expires September 12, 2021               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft           IDNA2008 and Unicode 12              March 2021


   is not unique.  The character U+08A1 (ARABIC LETTER BEH WITH HAMZA
   ABOVE) can be represented with the sequence ARABIC LETTER BEH
   (U+0628) and ARABIC HAMZA ABOVE (U+0654).  This identical to LATIN
   SMALL LETTER O WITH STROKE (U+00F8), which can be represented with
   the sequence LATIN SMALL LETTER O (U+006F) followed by COMBINING
   SHORT SOLIDUS OVERLAY (U+0337).

   Although the discussion about this specific code point resulted in
   acceptance of the derived property value of PVALID, the underlying
   problem with combining sequences is not understood fully.  Therefore
   it cannot be claimed that this case can be extrapolated to other
   situations and other code points.

3.2.  Changes between Unicode 7.0.0 and 10.0.0

      Change in number of characters in each category:

      Code points that changed derived property value: 0

      PVALID changed from 99867 to 122411 (+22544)

      UNASSIGNED changed from 861509 to 837775 (-23734)

      CONTEXTJ did not change, at 2

      CONTEXTO did not change, at 25

      DISALLOWED changed from 152709 to 153899 (+1190)

      TOTAL did not change, at 1114112

      There are no changes made to Unicode between version 7.0.0 and
      10.0.0 that impact IDNA2008 calculation of the derived property
      values.

3.3.  Changes between Unicode 10.0.0 and 11.0.0

      Change in number of characters in each category:

      Code points that changed derived property value: 1

      PVALID changed from 122411 to 122734 (+323)

      UNASSIGNED changed from 837775 to 837091 (-684)

      CONTEXTJ did not change, at 2

      CONTEXTO did not change, at 25

Internet-Draft           IDNA2008 and Unicode 12              March 2021


      DISALLOWED changed from 153899 to 154260 (+361)

      TOTAL did not change, at 1114112

      Georgian letters in the ranges U+10D0..U+10FA and U+10FD..U+10FF
      had their General Properties changed from Lo to Ll, to reflect
      their status as the lowercase of new Georgian case pairs.  Case
      mappings were also added.

      SHARADA SANDHI MARK (U+111C9) was changed from Po to Mn, and from
      bc=L to bc=NSM.

      The properties for ZANABAZAR SQUARE VOWEL SIGN AI (U+11A07) and
      ZANABZAR SQUARE VOWEL SIGN AU (U+11A08) were corrected from Mc to
      Mn.

      SPHERICAL ANGLE OPENING UP (U+29A1) was changed to Bidi_M=N.

   These changes to the Unicode Standard have the following implications
   for these code points:

   o  The newly assigned 684 characters are assigned a derived property
      value as of a result of applying the IDNA2008 algorithm.

   o  The Georgian letters in the ranges U+10D0..U+10FA and
      U+10FD..U+10FF existed before IDNA2008 was created.  Applying the
      IDNA2008 algorithm to the code points assigned the derived
      property value PVALID, and that value is unchanged even if the
      underlying Unicode properties have changed.  The newly encoded
      Mtavruli letters have general category "Lu" and are therefore
      DISALLOWED.

   o  The U+111C9 SHARADA SANDHI MARK was added to Unicode 8.0.0
      [Unicode-8.0.0].  Applying the IDNA2008 algorithm to the code
      point assigned the derived property value DISALLOWED.  The changes
      in the underlying properties in the Unicode Standard Version
      11.0.0 [Unicode-11.0.0] caused the derived property value to
      change to PVALID.

   o  The characters ZANABAZAR SQUARE VOWEL SIGN AI (U+11A07) and
      ZANABZAR SQUARE VOWEL SIGN AU (U+11A08) were added to Unicode
      10.0.0 [Unicode-10.0.0].  Applying the IDNA2008 algorithm to the
      code points assigned the derived property value PVALID, and that
      value is unchanged even if the underlying Unicode properties have
      changed.

   o  SPHERICAL ANGLE OPENING UP (U+29A1) existed before IDNA2008 was
      created.  Applying the IDNA2008 algorithm to the code point

      assigned the derived property value DISALLOWED, and that value is
      unchanged even if the underlying Unicode properties have changed.

3.4.  Changes between Unicode 11.0.0 and 12.0.0

      Change in number of characters in each category:

      Code points that changed derived property value: 0

      PVALID changed from 122734 to 123006 (+272)

4.  U+111C9 SHARADA SANDHI MARK

   As one can see in Section 3, an incompatible property change was made
   between Unicode 6.2.0 and 12.0.0, affecting the code point U+111C9.
   Its derived property value thus changed from DISALLOWED to PVALID.
   In situations like these, IDNA2008 allow for addition of rules to RFC
   5892 [RFC5892] section 2.7.  (BackwardCompatible (G)).  If the code
   point is accepted, it might still be rejected if validated by
   software based on older versions of Unicode than 11.0.0.  As the
   character is rarely used outside of the group of Sharada specialists,
   and used in some records for indicating sandhi breaks, the conclusion
   is that it could either be added as an exception or allowed to change
   its property value, as the use of the code point is limited outside a
   special community.  As including an exception would require
   implementation changes in deployed implementations of IDNA20008, the
   editor proposes that such a BackwardCompatible rule NOT to be added
   to IDNA2008.  This also ensures all sandhi marks being treated in an
   equal way.

   The IETF has decided to NOT add a BackwardCompatible rule to IDNA2008
   (i.e.  Section 2.7 of RFC 5892 [RFC5892]) for this code point.

5.  Conclusion

   As described in Section 3 and Section 4, changes have been made to
   Unicode between version 6.2.0 and 12.0.0.  Some changes to specific
   characters changed their derived property value, whereas other

   changes did not.  Given the deployment considerations described in
   Section 2.3 and changes in the Unicode Standard described in
   Section 3 and Section 4, including implications to normalization, the
   conclusion of this document is to not add any exception rules to
   IDNA2008.

   This document addresses only changes to Unicode between version 6.2.0
   and version 12.0.0.  Changes in future Unicode versions might result
   in the conclusion that exception rules need to be added to IDNA2008
   after review process explained in RFC 8753 [RFC8753].  Separately
   from any changes in Unicode, the IETF might conclude that updates to
   RFC 5892 [RFC5892] or other IDNA2008 documents might become
   necessary; such updates might include changes to the algorithm
   specified in IDNA2008 as well as additional rules, categories, or
   other forms of tuning.  Like the clarifications in RFC 8753
   [RFC8753].

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to update the IDNA Parameters registry of derived
   property values, after the expert reviewer validates that the derived
   property values are calculated correctly.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document makes recommendations regarding the use of the IDNA2008
   algorithm for calculation of derived property values, based on
   Unicode version 12.0.0.  This recommendation do not say anything
   about what recommendations to make for future versions of the Unicode
   Standard.

   Not following these recommendations can lead to various security
   issues.  Specifically, allowing confusable characters may lead to
   various phishing attacks, as described in the Security Consideration
   Sections in the documents listed in Section 2.1.
