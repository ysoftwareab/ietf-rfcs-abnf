1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Introduction

   When a user requires IPv6 connectivity in a IPv4-only or IPv4
   connectivity in a IPv6-only environment, currently a user has to find
   out where to find a IPv6 or IPv4 provider herself or use 6to4.

   This document describes a way how organisations can easily document
   the location of their services and have local users automatically
   make use of them.

3.  Entries in the _service domain

   The following records are possible to be inserted in the
   organisations _service domain [SERVICE].

   This example mentions to the user to try the TSP and TIC [TIC]
   protocol first, them having equal weight.  When that fails the user
   can use the website for more information.

   $ORIGIN example.net.
   _http._tcp            PTR     Example._http._tcp
   Example._http._tcp    SRV     42   100    80   www

   _https._tcp           PTR     Example._https._tcp
   Example._https._tcp   SRV     13   100   443   ssl

   ; Tunneling Services (Configuration etc)
   _tic._tcp             SRV     10   100  3874   tic
   _tsp._tcp             SRV     10   100  3653   tsp

   ; _service domain entries
   _service              TXT     "Example"
   _website._service     PTR     Example._https._tcp
                         PTR     Example._http._tcp
   _ipv6-tunnel._service PTR     _website._service
                         PTR     _tic._tcp
                         PTR     _tsp._tcp

   tic                   A       192.0.2.42
   tsp                   A       192.0.2.13

4.  Security Considerations

   There are no additional security considerations except the ones
   already given for the _service domain and prefix.

5.  IANA Considerations

   There are no considerations for IANA
