                   BGP FlowSpec with Time Constraints
                  draft-liang-idr-bgp-flowspec-time-00

Abstract

   The BGP flow specification (FlowSpec) is an additional tool to
   mitigate the effects of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.
   Since DDoS attacks are dynamic, filtering of a flow may only be
   necessary for some specified time, and be undesirable at other times.
   This document proposes a new BGP path attribute called "Flow Extended
   Attribute", which carries expected valid period information for a
   FlowSpec rule.  So network administrators can control certain types
   of traffic in a specified period.

1.  Introduction

   The BGP flow specification (FlowSpec) defined in [RFC5575] is an
   n-tuple consisting of several matching criteria, which gives network
   operators an additional tool to mitigate the effects of Distributed
   Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on their networks.  The matching
   criteria can include elements such as source and destination address
   prefixes, IP protocol, and transport protocol port numbers.  A given
   IP packet is said to match the defined flow if it matches all the
   specified criteria.[RFC5575] also defines flow actions, such as rate
   limit, redirect, and marking, associated with each flow specification
   rule.  A Border Gateway Protocol Network Layer Reachability
   Information (BGP NLRI) (AFI/SAFI: 1/133 for IPv4, AFI/SAFI: 1/134 for
   VPNv4) encoding format is used to distribute traffic flow
   specification rules.

   Since DDoS attacks are dynamic, redirection or filtering of a flow
   may only be necessary for some specified time, and be undesirable at

   other times [I-D.eddy-idr-flowspec-exp].  Thus, network
   administrators may only need to control certain types of traffic in a
   specified period; they can configure or inject a FlowSpec rule with a
   valid period, which determines when the said FlowSpec rule is
   effective.  There's another use case for this usage, for example, the
   network administrator may need to ensure reliable transmission for
   high priority services (e.g. video traffic) for VIP and limit the
   bandwidth for low priority services (e.g. web browsing) for common
   users during peak network utilization periods.

   The current BGP FlowSpec protocol cannot support to control the valid
   period of a FlowSpec rule precisely in the network.  For example, the
   network administrator may want to validate a FlowSpec rule on
   different BGP routers simultaneously; firstly the rule should be
   disseminated to those BGP routers.  But since those BGP routers would
   receive this FlowSpec rule with different delay, the FlowSpec rule
   may be valid at different time slightly.  Therefore the BGP router
   can specify a time parameter as the valid period when installing a
   FlowSpec rule.

   This document proposes a new BGP path attribute called "Flow Extended
   Attribute", which carries expected valid period information for a
   FlowSpec rule.  Besides, in order to make the FlowSpec rule more
   readable in diagnosing and logging, the "Flow Extended Attribute" can
   also carry the flow description information for the FlowSpec rule.

2.  Terminology

   This section contains definitions of terms used in this document.

      Specification (FlowSpec): A flow specification is an n-tuple
      consisting of several matching criteria that can be applied to IP
      traffic.  Each FlowSpec consists of a set of filters and a set of
      actions.

3.  Protocol Extensions

   In this document, BGP is used to distribute FlowSpec rules bound with
   a "Flow Extended Attribute".  This "Flow Extended Attribute" is an
   optional transitive attribute that is composed of a set of Type-
   Length-Value (TLV) encodings, including Flow Description sub-TLV and
   Flow Validation Period sub-TLV.

      When the "Duration Type" is set to 0, the corresponding FlowSpec
      rule is always valid until it is withdrawn by BGP signaling.  When
      the "Duration Type" is set to 1, the corresponding FlowSpec rule
      is only valid in a specified duration defined by the "Duration"
      field.  When the "Duration Type" is set to 2, the corresponding
      FlowSpec rule is valid until no traffic has matched it for a
      duration defined by the "Duration" field.

      Starting Time: Expressed in seconds and microseconds since
      midnight (zero hour), January 1, 1970 (UTC).  Precision of the
      "Starting Time" is implementation-dependent.  If the "Starting
      Time Type" is set to 0, this field is invalid.

      Duration: if the "Duration Type" is set to 0, this field is
      invalid.

      Delay Time: Only when the "Starting Time Type" is set to 1, this
      field is valid.  If the "Starting Time" is set to a valid
      value,the first valid period of the FlowSpec rule bound with this
      "Flow Extended Attribute" is [Starting Time + Delay, Starting Time
      + Delay + Duration]; if not, and assuming that the current time of
      the BGP router is T1, then the first valid period of the FlowSpec
      rule bound with this "Flow Extended Attribute" is [T1 + Delay, T1
      + Delay + Duration].

      Periodic Time: If zero, the value is unavailable.  The FlowSpec
      rule bound with this "Flow Extended Attribute" would be valid
      periodically.  The "Periodic Time" MUST be not less than the
      "Duration", otherwise this sub-TLV is invalid.

   The BGP router may not actively withdraw a FlowSpec rule, which has
   been invalid.  However, it should withdraw a FlowSpec rule according
   to the BGP signaling normally.

4.  IANA Considerations

   For the purpose of this work, IANA should allocate a new code from
   the "BGP Path Attributes" Registry to "BGP Flow Extended Attribute".

   IANA is requested to change the registration policy of the "BGP Flow
   Extended Attribute Sub-TLVs" registry to the following:

      o The values 0 and 255 are reserved.

      o The values in the range 1-127 are to be allocated using the
      "Standards Action" registration procedure.

      o The values in the range 128-251 are to be allocated using the
      "First Come, First Served" registration procedure.

      o The values in the range 252-254 are reserved for experimental
      use;

   IANA shall not allocate values from this range.

   IANA is requested to assign a code point from the "BGP Flow Extended
   Attribute Sub-TLVs" registry for "Flow Description", with this
   document being the reference.

   IANA is requested to assign a code point from the "BGP Flow Extended
   Attribute Sub-TLVs" registry for "Flow Validity Period", with this
   document being the reference.

5.  Security Considerations

   This extension to BGP does not change the underlying security issues
   inherent in the existing BGP.
