Abstract 

   The Link Management Protocol (LMP) is used to coordinate the 
   properties, use, and faults of data links in Generalized 
   Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) networks. Various proposals 
   have been advanced to provide extensions to the base LMP 
   specification. This document provides a generic procedure for LMP 
   implementations that do not recognize or do not support any one of 
   these extensions.

1. Introduction 

   The Link Management Protocol (LMP) [RFC4204] is being successfully 
   deployed in Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) 
   networks in the field. New LMP behaviors and protocol extensions are 
   being introduced in a number of IETF documents.  

   In the network, if one GMPLS Label Switching Router (LSR) supports a 
   new behavior or protocol extension, but its peer LSR does not, it is 
   necessary to have a protocol mechanism for resolving issues that may 
   arise. It is also beneficial to have a protocol mechanism to 
   discover the capabilities of peer LSRs. There is no such procedure 
   defined in the base LMP specification [RFC4204], so this document 
   defines how to handle LMP extensions both at legacy LSRs and at 
   upgraded LSRs that communicate with legacy LSRs.  

   In [RFC4204], the basic behaviors have been defined around the use of 
   the standard LMP message, which includes Config, Hello, Verify, Test,

   LinkSummary, ChannelStatus. Per [RCF4204], these behaviors MUST be 
   supported when the LMP is implemented, and the message types from 1 
   to 20 are used for these behaviors. 

   In [RFC4207], the SONET/SDH technology-specific information for LMP 
   is defined. The TRACE behavior is added to LMP, and the message types 
   from 21 to 31 were defined for the TRACE function. 

   In [RFC4209], extensions to LMP are defined to allow it to be used 
   between a peer node and an adjacent optical line system (OLS). The 
   LMP object class type and sub-object class name have been extended to 
   support DWDM behavior. 

   In [DCSC], the data channel consistency check behavior is defined, 
   the message types from 32 to 34 are used for this behavior. 

   This document describes the behavior negotiation procedure to make 
   sure both LSRs understand the LMP messages being exchanged between 
   peers. 

2. LMP Behavior Negotiation Procedure 

   The Config message is used in the control channel negotiation phase 
   of LMP [RC4204]. The LMP behavior negotiation procedure is defined in 
   this document as an addition at this phase. 

   The Config message is defined in Section 12.3.1 of [RFC4204] and 
   carries the <CONFIG> object (class name 6) as defined in Section 13.6 
   of [RFC4204]. Multiple <CONFIG> objects (each with a different Class 
   Type) MAY be present on a Config message in which case all of the 
   objects MUST be processed. 

   Two class types have been defined. 

   o    C-Type = 1, HelloConfig, defined in [RFC4204] 

   o    C-Type = 2, LMP_WDM_CONFIG, defined in [RFC4209] 

   This document defines a third C-Type with value 3 (TBD by IANA) to 
   report and negotiate new and future LMP extensions and behaviors. The 
   format of the new CONFIG Class is defined as follows: 

   o    C-Type = 3, ENHANCED_BEHAVIOR_CONFIG

   S: 1 bit 

   This bit indicates support for the SONET/SDH TRACE messages defined 
   in [RFC4207]. 

   D: 1 bit 

   This bit indicates support for the Data Channel Status Confirmation 
   messages defined in [DCSC]. 

   Further bits may be defied in future documents. 

   The Reserved field MUST be sent as zero and MUST NOT be ignored on 
   receipt. This allows the detection of supported/unsupported LMP 
   behaviors. For example, if a bit is set that is not recognized, then 
   a ConfigNack message MUST be sent with a CONFIG object that 
   represents the supported LMP behaviors. 

   An LSR that receives a Config message containing a <CONFIG> object 
   with a C-Type that it does not recognize MUST respond with a 
   ConfigNack message as described in [RFC4204]. Thus, legacy LMP nodes 
   that do not support the ENHANCED_BEHAVIOR_CONFIG C-Type defined in 
   this document will respond with a ConfigNack message. 

3. Security Considerations 

   [RFC4204] describes how LMP messages between peers can be secured, 
   and these measures are equally applicable to messages carrying the 
   new <CONFIG> object defined in this document. 

   The operation of the procedures described in this document does not 
   of itself constitute a security risk since they do not cause any 
   change in network state. It would be possible, if the messages were 
   intercepted or spoofed to cause bogus alerts in the management plane, 
   or to cause LMP peers to consider that they could or could not 
   operate protocol extensions, and so the use of the LMP security 
   measures are RECOMMENDED.

4. IANA Considerations 

   IANA maintains the "Link Management Protocol (LMP)" registry which 
   has a subregistry called "LMP Object Class name space and Class type 
   (C-Type)".  

   IANA is requested to make an assignment from this registry as follows: 

   6   CONFIG                                   [RFC4204] 
             CONFIG Object Class type name space  
              C-Type   Description                    Reference 
              ------   ------------------------       --------- 
                   3   ENHANCED_BEHAVIOR_CONFIG       [This.I-D]
