     1. Introduction 
    
   This informational I-D has the objective of focusing the Internet   
   communications community on requirements for telephony devices using 
   SIP. 
   We base this information from developing and using a large number of 
   SIP telephony devices in carrier and private IP networks and on the 
   Internet. This deployment has shown the need for generic requirements 
   for SIP telephony devices and also the need for some specifics that 
   can be used in SIP interoperability testing.  
       
   SIP telephony devices, also referred to as SIP User Agents (UAs) can 
   be any type of IP networked computing device enabled for SIP based IP 
   telephony. SIP telephony devices can be SIP phones, adaptors for   
   analog phones and for fax machines, conference speakerphones, 
   software packages (soft clients) running on PCs, laptops, wireless 
   connected PDAs, 'Wi-Fi' SIP mobile phones, as well as other mobile 
   and cordless phones that support SIP signaling for real time 
   communications.  
    
   SIP telephony devices can also be instant messaging (IM) applications 
   that have a telephony option. 
    
   SIP devices MAY also support various other media besides voice, such   
   as text, video, games and other Internet applications;   however the 
   non-voice requirements are not specified in this document, except 
   when providing enhanced telephony features, as will be shown.

                  SIP Telephony Device Requirements         June 2004 
 
 
   SIP telephony devices are highly complex IP endpoints that speak many 
   Internet protocols, have audio and visual interfaces and require 
   functionality targeted at several constituencies: 1) End users, (2) 
   service providers and network administrators and (3) manufacturers, 
   as well as (4) system integrators. 
     
   The objectives of the requirements are a minimum set of 
   interoperability and multi-vendor supported core features, so as to 
   enable similar ease of purchase, installation and operation as found 
   for standard PCs, analog feature phones or mobile phones.  Given the 
   cost of some feature rich display phones may approach the cost of PCs 
   and PDAs, similar or even better ease of use as compared to personal 
   computers and networked PDAs is expected by both end users and 
   network administrators. 
    
     2. Conventions Used In This Document 
    
   This document is informational and therefore the key words "MUST", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "MAY", in this document are not to be 
   interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [2], but rather indicate the 
   nature of the suggested requirement.    
    
     3. Generic Requirements 
    
   We present here a minimal set of requirements that MUST be met by all 
   SIP [3] telephony devices, except where SHOULD or MAY is specified. 
    
     3.1 IP Host Requirements 
    
   This section applies mainly to desktop phones and other special 
   purpose SIP hardware. Some of the requirements in this section are 
   not applicable to PC/laptop or PDA software phones (soft phones) and 
   mobile phones. 
 
  REQ-1: SIP telephony devices MUST be able to acquire IP network 
          settings by automatic configuration using DHCP [4]. 

  REQ-2: SIP telephony devices MUST be able to acquire IP network 
          settings by manual entry of settings from the device.  

  REQ-3: SIP telephony devices SHOULD support IPv6. Some newer wireless 
          networks may mandate support for IPv6 and in such networks SIP 
          telephony devices MUST support IPv6.  

  REQ-4: SIP telephony devices that display the time MUST support the 
          Simple Network Time Protocol [5].

  REQ-5: Desktop SIP phones and other special purpose SIP telephony 
          devices MUST be able to upgrade their firmware to support 
          additional features and improved functionality.  

  REQ-6: Users SHOULD be able to upgrade the devices with no special 
          applications or equipment; or a service provider SHOULD be 
          able to push the upgrades down to the devices remotely. 

     3.2 DNS and ENUM Support 
    
  REQ-7: SIP telephony devices MUST support RFC 3263 [6] for locating a 
          SIP Server and selecting a transport protocol. 

  REQ-8: SIP telephony devices MUST support DNS resolvers that are 
          configurable with at least two entries for DNS servers for 
          redundancy.  To provide efficient DNS resolution, SIP 
          telephony devices SHOULD query responsive DNS servers and skip 
          DNS servers that have been non-responsive to recent queries. 

  REQ-9: To provide efficient DNS resolution and to limit post-dial 
          delay, SIP telephony devices MUST cache DNS responses based on 
          the DNS time-to-live. 

  REQ-10: For DNS efficiency, SIP telephony devices SHOULD use the 
          additional information section of the DNS response instead of 
          generating additional DNS queries. 

  REQ-11: SIP telephony devices SHOULD support ENUM [7]. 

     3.3 SIP Device Resident Telephony Features 
    
  REQ-12: SIP telephony devices MUST support RFC 3261 [3]. 

  REQ-13: SIP telephony devices SHOULD support the SIP Privacy header 
          [8]. 

  REQ-14: SIP telephony devices SHOULD be able to place an existing call 
          on hold, and initiate or receive another call, as specified in 
          RFC 3264 [12] and SHOULD NOT omit the sendrecv attribute.

                  SIP Telephony Device Requirements         June 2004 
 
 
  REQ-15: SIP telephony devices MUST provide a call waiting indicator.  
          When participating in a call, the user MUST be alerted audibly 
          and/or visually of another incoming call. The user MUST be 
          able to enable/disable the call waiting indicator.  

  REQ-16: SIP telephony devices MUST support SIP message waiting [43] 
          and the integration with message store platforms. 

  REQ-17: SIP telephony devices MAY support a local dial plan.  The dial 
          plan MUST consist of a pattern string to match dial digits, 
          and the ability to strip and also append prefix digits, and 
          also append suffix digits.  

  REQ-18: SIP telephony devices MUST support the URLs for Telephone 
          numbers [9]. See also the amended version [44]. 

  REQ-19: SIP telephony devices MUST support REFER and NOTIFY as 
          required to support call transfer [45], [46]. SIP telephony 
          devices MUST support escaped headers in the Refer-To: header.  

  REQ-20: SIP telephony devices MUST support the unattended call 
          transfer flows as defined in [46]. 

  REQ-21: SIP telephony devices MUST support attended call transfer as 
          defined in [46].  

  REQ-22: SIP telephony devices MAY support device based 3-way calling 
          by mixing the audio streams of at least 2 separate calls. 

  REQ-23: SIP telephony devices MUST be able to send DTMF named 
          telephone events as specified by RFC 2833 [11]. 

  REQ-24: Payload type negotiation MUST comply with RFC 3264 [12] and 
          with the registered MIME types for RTP payload formats in RFC 
          3555 [13]. 

  REQ-25: The dynamic payload type MUST remain constant throughout the 
          session. For example, if an endpoint decides to renegotiate 
          codecs or put the call on hold, the payload type for the re-
          invite MUST be the same as the initial payload type. SIP

                  SIP Telephony Device Requirements         June 2004 
 
 
          devices SHOULD support Flow Identification as defined in RFC 
          3388 [11]. 

  REQ-26: SIP telephony devices MUST generate local ringing and MUST 
          ignore any early RTP media when a 180 Ringing response is 
          received. 

  REQ-27: SIP telephony devices MUST play the first RTP stream and 
          ignore any other RTP media streams when a 183 Session 
          Progress response is received.  

  REQ-28: SIP telephony devices MUST obey the last 18x message received 
          when multiple 18x responses are received.  If the last 
          response is 180 Ringing, the client MUST generate local 
          ringing. If the last response is 183 Session Progress, the 
          client MUST play the RTP stream.     

  REQ-29: SIP devices with a display MUST support the call-info header 
          and depending on the display capabilities MAY for example 
          display an icon or the image of the caller. 

  REQ-30: To provide additional information about call failures, SIP 
          telephony devices MUST display the Reason Phrase of the SIP 
          message instead of mapping the Status-Code to custom or 
          default messages.  The devices MAY use an internal Status 
          Code table if there was a problem with the language 
          negotiation.  

  REQ-31: SIP telephony devices MUST support music on hold as shown in 
          "SIP Service Examples" [46]. 

  REQ-32: SIP telephony devices MAY ring after a call has been on hold 
          for a predetermined period of time, typically 3 minutes. 

     3.4 Support for SIP Services 
    
  REQ-33: SIP telephony devices MUST support the SIP Basic Call Flow 
          Examples [47].

                  SIP Telephony Device Requirements         June 2004 
 
 
  REQ-34: SIP telephony devices MUST support the SIP-PSTN Service 
          Examples [16]. 

  REQ-35: SIP telephony devices MUST support the Third Party Call 
          Control model [17]. 

  REQ-36: SIP telephony devices SHOULD support other SIP call control 
          and multiparty usage [43]. 

  REQ-37: SIP telephony devices SHOULD support conferencing services for 
          voice and IM [48], [49]. 

  REQ-38: SIP telephony devices MUST support caller and called party 
          preferences [52]. 

  REQ-39: SIP telephony devices MAY support service mobility: Devices 
          MAY allow roaming users to upload their identity so as to have 
          access to their services and preferences from the home SIP 
          server. Examples of user data to be available for roaming 
          users are: User service ID, the dialing plan, personal 
          directory and caller/called party preferences. 

     3.5 Basic Telephony and Presence Information Support 
    
   The large color displays in some newer models make such SIP phones 
   and applications attractive for a rich communication environment. 
   This document is focused however only on telephony specific features 
   enabled by SIP Presence and SIP Events. 
    
   SIP telephony devices can also support for example presence states, 
   such as the traditional Do Not Disturb, new event state based 
   information, such as being in another call or being in a conference, 
   typing a message, emoticons, etc. Some SIP telephony devices can 
   support for example a voice session and several IM sessions with 
   different parties. 
 
  REQ-40: SIP telephony devices SHOULD support Presence information [50] 
          and SHOULD support the Rich Presence Information Data Format 
          [51] for the new IP communication services enabled by 
          Presence.

                  SIP Telephony Device Requirements         June 2004 
 
 
  REQ-41: Users MUST be able to set the state of the SIP telephony 
          device to Do Not Disturb, manifested as a Presence state 
          across the network.  

  REQ-42: SIP telephony devices with Do Not Disturb enabled MUST 
          respond to new sessions with 486 Busy Here.  

     3.6         Emergency and Resource Priority Support  
    
  REQ-43: Emergency calling: For emergency numbers (e.g. 911, SOS URL) 
          the client MUST send the location information acquired by 
          various means as detailed in [53]. SIP telephony devices MUST 
          be provisioned with a URL or phone number of the emergency 
          call center and MUST support the SOS URL [54].  

  REQ-44: Priority header: SIP devices MUST support the Priority header 
          specified in RFC 3261 for such applications as emergency calls 
          or for selective call acceptance. 

  REQ-45: Resource Priority header: SIP telephony devices that are used 
          in environments that support emergency preparedness MUST also 
          support the sending and receiving of the Resource-Priority 
          header as specified in [55]. The Resource Priority header 
          influences the behavior for message routing in SIP proxies and 
          PSTN telephony gateways and is different from the SIP Priority 
          header specified in RFC 3261. Users of SIP telephony devices 
          may want to be interrupted in their lower-priority 
          communications activities if such an emergency communication 
          request arrives. 

     3.7 Multi-Line Requirements 
    
   A SIP telephony device can have multiple lines: One SIP telephony 
   device can be registered simultaneously with different SIP registrars 
   from different service providers, using different names and 
   credentials for each line. The different sets of names and 
   credentials are also called 'SIP accounts'. The line terminology 
   has been borrowed from multi-line PSTN/PBX phones, except that for 
   SIP telephony devices there can be different SIP registrar/proxies 
   for each line, each of which may belong to a different service 
   provider, whereas this would be an exceptional case for the PSTN and 
   certainly not the case for PBX phones. Multi-line SIP telephony

                  SIP Telephony Device Requirements         June 2004 
 
 
   devices resemble more closely e-mail clients that can support several 
   e-mail accounts. 
    
   Note: Each SIP account can usually support different Addresses of 
   Record (AOR) with a different list of contact addresses (CA), as may 
   be convenient for example when having different SIP accounts for 
   business and for the private life. 
   Some of the CAs in different SIP accounts may though point to the 
   same devices.  
    
  REQ-46: Multi-line SIP telephony devices MUST support a unique 
          authentication username, authentication password, registrar, 
          and identity to be provisioned for each line. The 
          authentication username MAY be identical with the user name of 
          the AOR and the domain name MAY be identical with the host 
          name of the registrar.    

  REQ-47: Multi-line SIP telephony devices MUST be able to support the 
          state of the client to Do Not Disturb on a per line basis.    

  REQ-48: Multi-line SIP telephony devices MUST support multi-line call 
          waiting indicators.  Devices MUST allow the call waiting 
          indicator to be set on a per line basis. 

  REQ-49: Multi-line SIP telephony devices MUST be able to provision a 
          different ring tone for each line. 

     3.8 User Mobility 
    
  The following requirements allow users with a set of credentials to 
  use any SIP telephony device that can support personal credentials 
  from several users, distinct from the identity of the device. 
    
   REQ-50:User mobility enabled SIP telephony devices MUST store static 
          credentials associated with the device in non-volatile memory.  
          This static profile is used during the power up sequence. 

   REQ-51:User mobility enabled SIP telephony devices SHOULD allow a 
          user to walk up to a device and input their personal 
          credentials. All user features and settings stored in SIP 
          proxy and the associated policy server SHOULD be available to 
          the user.

   REQ-52:User mobility enabled SIP telephony devices for the desktop 
          MUST use the local static location data associated with the 
          device for emergency calls.  

     3.9 Interactive Text Support 
    
  REQ-53: SIP telephony devices such as SIP display phones and IP-analog 
          adapters SHOULD support the accessibility for user 
          requirements for the deaf, hard of hearing and speech impaired 
          individuals as per RCF 3351 [18] and also for interactive text 
          conversation [56], [70]. 

          Note: SIP telephony devices supporting Instant Messaging based 
          on SIMPLE [50] support text conversation based on blocks of 
          text. However, interactive text conversation is often 
          preferred here due to its interactive and more streaming-like 
          nature. 

  REQ-54: SIP telephony devices SHOULD provide a way to input text and 
          to display text through any reasonable method. Built-in user 
          interfaces, standard wired or wireless interfaces, and/or 
          support for text through a web interface are all considered 
          reasonable mechanisms.  

  REQ-55: SIP telephony devices SHOULD provide an external standard 
          wired or wireless link to connect external input (keyboard, 
          mouse) and display devices. 

  REQ-56: SIP-33: SIP telephony devices which include a display, or have 
          a facility for connecting an external display, MUST include 
          protocol support as described in RFC 2793 for real-time 
          interactive text.  

  REQ-57: There may be value of having RFC 2793 support in a terminal 
          also without a visual display. A synthetic voice output for 
          the text conversation may be of value for all who can hear, 
          and thereby having the opportunity to have a text conversation 
          with other users. 

  REQ-58: SIP telephony devices MAY provide analog adaptor functionality 
          through an RJ-11 FXO port to support FXS devices.  If an RJ-11

                  SIP Telephony Device Requirements         June 2004 
 
 
          (FXO) port is provided, then it MAY support a gateway function 
          from all text-telephone protocols according to ITU-T 
          Recommendation V.18 to RFC 2793 text conversation (in fact 
          this is encouraged in the near term during the transition to 
          widespread use of SIP telephony devices). If this gateway 
          function is not included or fails, the device MUST pass-
          through all text-telephone protocols according to ITU-T 
          Recommendation V.18, November 2000, in a transparent fashion. 

  REQ-59: SIP telephony devices MAY provide a 2.5 mm audio port, in 
          portable SIP devices, such as PDAs and various wireless SIP 
          phones. 

     3.10 Other Related Protocols 
    
  REQ-60: SIP telephony devices MUST support Real-Time Protocol and the 
          Real-Time Control Protocol, RFC 3550 [20]. SIP devices SHOULD 
          use RTCP Extended Reports for logging and reporting on network 
          support for voice quality, RFC [21] and MAY also support the 
          RTCP summary report delivery [57].  

     3.11 SIP Device Security Requirements 
    
   This paragraph is focused on the requirements for SIP device security 
   only. Section 4 on Security Consideration deals with some wider 
   security issues. 
    
  REQ-61: SIP telephony devices MUST support digest authentication as 
          per RFC3261. In addition, SIP telephony devices SHOULD support 
          TLS for secure transport [36] for scenarios where the SIP 
          registrar is located outside the secure, private IP network in 
          which the SIP UA may reside.   

  REQ-62: SIP telephony devices MUST be able to password protect 
          configuration information and administrative functions. 

  REQ-63: SIP telephony devices MUST NOT display the password to the 
          user or administrator after it has been entered.  

  REQ-64: SIP clients MUST be able to disable remote access, i.e. block 
          incoming SNMP (where this is supported), HTTP, and other 
          services not necessary for basic operation.

                  SIP Telephony Device Requirements         June 2004 
 
 
  REQ-65: SIP telephony devices MUST support the option to reject an 
          incoming INVITE where the user-portion of the SIP request URI 
          is blank or does not match a provisioned AOR.  This provides 
          protection against war-dialer attacks.  The setting to 
          accept/reject MUST be configurable. 

  REQ-66: When TLS is not used, SIP telephony devices MUST be able to 
          reject an incoming INVITE when the message does not come from 
          the proxy or proxies where the client is registered.  This 
          prevents callers from bypassing terminating call features on 
          the proxy.  For DNS SRV specified proxy addresses, the client 
          must accept an INVITE from all of the resolved proxy IP 
          addresses. 

     3.12 Quality of Service 
    
  REQ-67: SIP devices MUST support the IPv4 DSCP field for RTP streams 
          as per RFC 2597 [22] that supersedes the Type of Service (ToS) 
          bits described in RFC 791. The DSCP setting MUST be 
          configurable to complement the local network policy.  

  REQ-68: If not specifically provisioned, SIP telephony devices SHOULD 
          mark RTP packets with the recommended DSCP for expedited 
          forwarding (codepoint 101110); and mark SIP packets with DSCP 
          AF31 (codepoint 011010). 

  REQ-69: SIP telephony devices MAY support RSVP [23]. 

     3.13 Media Requirements 
    
  REQ-70: To simplify the interoperability issues, SIP telephony devices 
          MUST use the first matching codec listed by the receiver if 
          the requested codec is available in the called device. 

  REQ-71: To reduce overall bandwidth, SIP telephony devices MAY support 
          active voice detection and comfort noise generation. 

     3.14 Voice Codecs 
    
   Internet telephony devices face the problem of supporting multiple 
   codecs due to various historic reasons, on how telecom industry 
   players have approached codec implementations and the serious

   intellectual property and licensing problems associated with most 
   codec types.  
   RFC 3551 [24] lists 17 registered MIME subtypes for audio codecs. 
   This memo however requires the support of a minimal number of five 
   codecs used in wireline VoIP, besides various codecs found in mobile 
   phones. 
    
  REQ-72: SIP telephony devices SHOULD support AVT payload type 0 (G.711 
          uLaw) as the default codec [25] and its Annexes 1 and 2. 

  REQ-73: SIP telephony devices MUST support the Internet Low Bit Rate 
          codec (iLBC) [26], [27]. 

  REQ-74: SIP telephony devices SHOULD support GSM codecs found in 
          various 3G wireless phones.  

  REQ-75: SIP telephony devices MAY support G.723.1, where low bandwidth 
          is needed. 

  REQ-76: SIP telephony devices MAY support G.729 and its annexes. 

   Note: A summary count reveals up to 25 and more voice codec types 
          currently in use. The authors believe there is a need for a 
          single multi-rate Internet codec, such as Speex [28] that can 
          effectively be substituted for all of the multiple legacy 
          narrow band compressed G.xx codec types, such as G. 711, 
          G.729, G.723.1, G.722, etc., thus avoiding the complexity and 
          cost to implementers and service providers alike who are 
          burdened by supporting so many codec types, besides the 
          additional licensing costs.  
    
          The authors believe the Internet Low Bit Rate codec (iLBC) 
          should be the default codec for Internet telephony. 
     
     3.15 Telephony Sound Requirements 
    
  REQ-77: SIP telephony devices SHOULD comply with the handset receive 
          comfort noise requirements outlined in the ANSI standards 
          [29], [30]. 

  REQ-78: SIP telephony devices SHOULD comply with the stability or 
          minimum loss defined in ITU-T G.177 [31].

                  SIP Telephony Device Requirements         June 2004 
 
 
  REQ-79: SIP telephony devices MAY provide a full-duplex speakerphone 
          with echo and side tone cancellation. The design of high 
          quality side tone cancellation for desktop IP phones, laptop 
          computers and PDAs is outside the scope of this memo. 

  REQ-80: SIP telephony device MAY support different ring-tones based on 
          the caller identity. 

   3.16          International Requirements 
    
  REQ-81: SIP telephony devices SHOULD indicate the preferred language 
          [34] using Caller Preferences [52]. 

  REQ-82: SIP telephony devices intended to be used in various language 
          settings [34], MUST support other languages for menus, help, 
          and labels. 

     3.17 Support for Applications 
    
   The following requirements apply to functions placed in the SIP 
   telephony device. 
    
  REQ-83: SIP telephony devices that have a large display and support 
           presence SHOULD display a buddy list [50]. 

  REQ-84: SIP telephony devices MAY support LDAP for client-based 
           directory lookup.  

  REQ-85: SIP telephony devices MAY support a phone setup where a URL 
           is automatically dialed when the phone goes off-hook.  

     3.18 Web Based Feature Management 
    
  REQ-86: SIP telephony devices SHOULD support an internal web server 
           to allow users to manually configure the phone and to set up 
           personal phone services such as the address book, speed-
           dial, ringer tones, and last but not least the call handling 
           options for the various lines, aliases, in a user friendly 
           fashion. Web pages to manage the SIP telephony device SHOULD 
           be supported by the individual device, or MAY be supported 
           in managed networks from centralized web servers. Managing 
           SIP telephony devices SHOULD NOT require special client

           software on the PC or require a dedicated management 
           console. SIP telephony devices SHOULD support https 
           transport for this purpose.  

     3.19 Firewall and NAT Traversal 
    
   The following requirements allow SIP clients to properly function 
   behind various firewall architectures. 
   
  REQ-87: SIP telephony devices SHOULD be able to operate behind a 
          static NAPT (Network Address Translation/Port Address 
          Translation) device. This implies the SIP telephony device 
          SHOULD be able to 1) populate SIP messages with the public, 
          external address of the NAPT device, 2) use symmetric UDP or 
          TCP for signaling, and 3) Use symmetric RTP. 

  REQ-88: SIP telephony devices SHOULD support the STUN protocol [32] 
          for determining the NAPT public external address. A 
          classification of scenarios and NATs where STUN is effective 
          is reported in [58]. 

          Note: Developers are advised to follow the standards process 
          for ICE [63] and eventually support ICE in SIP telephony 
          devices. 
   
  REQ-89: SIP telephony devices SHOULD support UPnP 
          (http://www.upnp.org/) for NAPT device traversal. 

  REQ-90: SIP telephony devices MUST be able to limit the ports used for 
          RTP to a provisioned range. 

     3.20 Device Interfaces 
    
   SIP telephony devices MAY have various types of interfaces, such as   
   resembling a desktop phone, cordless phone, mobile phone, handheld   
   computer, laptop computer and MAY have various interface models, such 
   as for phones, IM GUI or other. Given the variety of possible 
   interfaces, only the generic requirements can be listed here. 
    
  REQ-91: SIP telephony devices MUST have two types of interface 
           capabilities, for both phone numbers and URLs, both 
           accessible to the end user.

                  SIP Telephony Device Requirements         June 2004 
 
 
  REQ-92: SIP telephony devices MUST have a telephony-like dial-pad 
           and MAY have telephony style buttons like mute, redial, 
           transfer, conference, hold, etc.  The traditional telephony 
           dial-pad interface MAY appear as an option in large screen 
           telephony devices using other interface models, such as 
           Push-To-Talk in mobile phones and the Presence and IM GUI 
           found in PCs, PDAs and mobile phones and wireless phones. 

  REQ-93: SIP telephony devices MUST have a convenient way for 
           entering SIP URLs and phone numbers.  This includes all 
           alphanumeric characters allowed in legal SIP URLs. Possible 
           approaches include using a web page, display and keyboard 
           entry, type-ahead or graffiti for PDAs. 

  REQ-94: SIP telephony devices should allow phone number entry in 
           human friendly fashion, with the usual separators and 
           brackets between digits and digit groups. 

     4. Glossary and Usage for the Configuration Settings 
    
  SIP telephony devices are quite complex and their configuration is 
  made more difficult by the widely diverse use of technical terms for 
  the settings. We present here a glossary of the most common settings 
  and some of the more widely used values for some settings. 
   
  Settings are the information on a SIP UA that it needs so as to be a 
  functional SIP endpoint. The settings defined in this document are 
  not intended to be a complete listing of all possible settings. It 
  MUST be possible to add vendor specific settings. 
  The list of available settings includes settings that MUST, SHOULD or 
  MAY be used by all devices (when present) and that make up the common 
  denominator that is used and understood by all devices. However, the 
  list is open to vendor specific extensions that support additional 
  settings, which enable a rich and valuable set of features. 
   
  Settings MAY be read-only on the device. This avoids the 
  misconfiguration of important settings by inexperienced users 
  generating service cost for operators. The settings provisioning 
  process SHOULD indicate which settings can be changed by the end-user 
  and which settings should be protected. 
   
  In order to achieve wide adoption of any settings format it is 
  important that it should not be excessive in size for modest devices 
  to use it. Any format SHOULD be structured enough to allow flexible 
  extensions to it by vendors.

                  SIP Telephony Device Requirements         June 2004 
 
 
   
  Settings may belong to the device or to a SIP service provider and 
  the address of record (AOR) registered there. When the device acts in 
  the context of an AOR, it will first try to look up a setting in the 
  AOR context. If the setting can not be found in that context, the 
  device will try to find the setting in the device context. If that 
  also fails, the device MAY use a default value for the setting.  
   
  The examples shown here are just of informational nature. Other 
  documents may specify the syntax and semantics for the respective 
  settings. 
   
   4.1 Device ID 
   
          A device setting MAY include some unique identifier for the 
          device it represents. This MAY be an arbitrary device name 
          chosen by the user, the MAC address, some manufacturer serial 
          number or some other unique piece of data. The Device ID 
          SHOULD also indicate the ID type. 
           
          Example: DeviceId=000413100A10;type=MAC 
               
     4.2 Signaling Port 
   
          The port that MUST be used for a specific transport protocol 
          for SIP MAY be indicated with the SIP ports setting. If this 
          setting is omitted, the device MAY choose any port. For UDP, 
          the port must also be used for sending requests so that NAT 
          devices will be able to route the responses back to the UA. 
           
          Example: SIPPort=5060;transport=UDP 
   
     4.3 RTP Port Range 
   
          A range of port numbers MUST be used by a device for the 
          consecutive pairs of ports which MUST be used to receive audio 
          and control information (RTP and RTCP) for each concurrent 
          connection. Sometimes this is required to support firewall 
          traversal and it helps network operators to identify voice 
          packets. 
           
          Example: RTPPorts=50000-51000 
      
     4.4 Quality of Service 
   
          The QoS settings for outbound packets SHOULD be configurable 
          for network packets associated with call signaling (SIP) and 
          media transport (RTP/RTCP). These settings help network 
          operators identifying voice packets in their network and allow 
 
 
   Sinnreich et al.    Expires  February 2005              [Page 18] 
                  SIP Telephony Device Requirements         June 2004 
 
 
          them to transport them with the required QoS. The settings are 
          independently configurable for the different transport layers 
          and signaling, media or administration. The QoS settings 
          SHOULD also include the QoS mechanism. 
           
          For both categories of network traffic, the device SHOULD 
          permit configuration of the type of service settings for both 
          layer 3 (IP DiffServ) and layer 2 (for example IEEE 802.1D/Q) 
          of the network protocol stack.   
           
          Example: RTPQoS=0xA0;type=DiffSrv, 5;type=802.1DQ;vlan=324 
   
     4.5 Default Call Handling  
   
          All of the call handling settings defined below can be defined 
          here as default behaviors.   
   
     4.6 Outbound Proxy 
   
          The outbound proxy for a device MAY be set. The setting MAY 
          require that all signaling packets MUST be sent to the 
          outbound proxy or that only in the case when no route has been 
          received the outbound proxy MUST be used. This ensures that 
          NAT application layer gateways are always in the signaling 
          path. The second requirement allows the optimization of the 
          routing by the outbound proxy. 
           
          Example: OutboundProxy=sip:nat.proxy.com 
   
     4.7 Default Outbound Proxy 
   
          The default outbound proxy SHOULD be a global setting (not 
          related to a specific line).  
           
          Example: DefaultProxy=sip:123@proxy.com 
   
     4.8 SIP Session Timer 
    
          The re-invite timer allows user agents to detect broken 
          sessions caused by network failures. A value indicating the 
          number of seconds for the next re-invite SHOULD be used if 
          provided.  
           
          Example: SessionTimer=600;unit=seconds 
   
     4.9 Telephone Dialing Functions 
   
          As most telephone users are used to dialing digits to indicate 
          the address of the destination, there is a need for specifying 
 
 
   Sinnreich et al.    Expires  February 2005              [Page 19] 
                  SIP Telephony Device Requirements         June 2004 
 
 
          the rule by which digits are transformed into a URL (usually 
          SIP URL or TEL URL).   
   
     4.10 Phone Number Representations 
   
          SIP phones need to understand entries in the phone book of the 
          most common separators used between dialed digits, such as 
          spaces, angle and round brackets, dashes and dots. 
           
          Example: A phonebook entry of +49(30)398.33-401 should be 
          translated into +493039833401. 
   
     4.11 Digit Maps and/or the Dial/OK Key 
   
          A SIP UA needs to translate user input before it can generate 
          a valid request. Digit maps are settings that describe the 
          parameters of this process.  
           
          If present, digit maps define patterns that when matched 
          define: 
           
          1) A rule by which the end point can judge that the user has 
          completed dialing, and 
          2) A rule to construct a URL from the dialed digits, and 
          optionally 
          3) An outbound proxy to be used in routing the SIP INVITE. 
           
          A critical timer MAY be provided which determines how long the 
          device SHOULD wait before dialing if a dial plan contains a T 
          (Timer) character. It MAY also provide a timer for the maximum 
          elapsed time which SHOULD pass before dialing if the digits 
          entered by the user match no dial plan. If the UA has a Dial 
          or Ok key, pressing this key will override the timer setting.  
           
          SIP telephony devices SHOULD have a Dial/OK key. 
           
          After sending a request, UA SHOULD be prepared to receive a 
          484 Address Incomplete response. In this case, the user agent 
          should accept more user input and try again to dial the 
          number. 
           
          An example digit map could use regular expressions like in DNS 
          NAPTR (RFC2915) to translate user input into a SIP URL. 
          Additional replacement patterns like d could insert the 
          domain name of the used AOR. Additional parameters could be 
          inserted in the flags portion of the substitution expression. 
          A list of those patterns would make up the dial plan: 
           
          |^([0-9]*)#$|sip:\1@\d;user=phone|outbound=proxy.com

          |^([a-zA-Z0-9&=+\$,;?\-_.!~*'()%]+@.+)|sip:\1| 
          |^([a-zA-Z0-9&=+\$,;?\-_.!~*'()%]+)$|sip:\1@\d| 
          |^(.*)$|sip:\1@\d|timeout=5 
   
     4.12 Default Digit Map 
   
          The SIP telephony device SHOULD support the configuration of a 
          default digit map. If the SIP telephony device does not 
          support digit maps, it SHOULD at least support a default digit 
          map rule to construct a URL from digits. If the end point does 
          support digit maps, this rule applies if none of the digit 
          maps match. 
           
          For example, when a user enters 12345, the UA might send the 
          request to sip:12345@proxy.com;user=phone after the user 
          presses the OK key. 
   
     4.13 SIP Timer Settings 
   
          The parameters for SIP (like timer T1) and other related 
          settings MAY be indicated. An example of usage would be the 
          reduction of the DNS SRV failover time. 
           
          Example: SIPTimer=t1=100;unit=ms 
           
          Note: The timer settings can be included in the digit map. 
   
     4.14 Audio Codecs 
    
          In some cases operators want to control which codecs MAY be 
          used in their network. The desired subset of codecs supported 
          by the device MUST be configurable along with the order of 
          preference. Service providers MUST have the possibility of 
          plugging in their own codecs of choice. The codec settings MAY 
          include the packet length and other parameters like silence 
          suppression or comfort noise generation. 
           
          The set of available codecs will be used in the codec 
          negotiation according to RFC 3264 [12]. 
           
          Example: Codecs=speex/8000;ptime=20;cng=on, gsm;ptime=30 
           
          The settings MAY include hints about privacy for audio using 
          SRTP that either mandate or encourage the usage of secure RTP. 
           
          Example: SRTP=mandatory 
   
     4.15 DTMF Method

                  SIP Telephony Device Requirements         June 2004 
 
 
          Keyboard interaction can be indicated with in-band tones or 
          preferable with out-of-band RTP packets (RFC 2833) [11]. The 
          method for sending these events SHOULD be configurable with 
          the order of precedence. Settings MAY include additional 
          parameters like the content-type that should be used. 
           
          Example: DTMFMethod=INFO;type=application/dtmf, RFC2833, 
          [11]. 
   
     4.16 Local and Regional Parameters      
   
          Certain settings are dependent upon the regional location for 
          the daylight saving time rules and for the time zone.   
                  
          Time Zone and UTC Offset 
           
          A time zone MAY be specified for the user.   
          Where one is specified; it SHOULD use the schema used by the 
          Olson Time One database [33]. 
           
          Examples of the database naming scheme are Asia/Dubai or 
          America/Los Angeles where the first part of the name is the 
          continent or ocean and the second part is normally the largest 
          city on that time-zone. Optional parameters like the UTC 
          offset may provide additional information for UA that are not 
          able to map the time zone information to a internal database.  
           
          Example: TimeZone=Asia/Dubai;offset=7200 
   
     4.17 Time Server 
   
          A time server SHOULD be used. DHCP is the preferred way to 
          provide this setting. Optional parameters may indicate the 
          protocol that SHOULD be used for determining the time. If 
          present, the DHCP time server setting has higher precedence 
          than the time server Setting. 
           
          Example: TimeServer=12.34.5.2;protocol=NTP 
   
     4.18 Language 
   
          Setting the correct language is important for simple 
          installation around the globe.  
                  
          A language Setting SHOULD be specified for the whole device. 
          Where it is specified it MUST use the codes defined in RFC 
          3066 [34] to provide some predictability. 
           
          Example: Language=de 
 
 
   Sinnreich et al.    Expires  February 2005              [Page 22] 
                  SIP Telephony Device Requirements         June 2004 
 
 
                  
          It is recommended to set the Language as writable, so that the 
          user MAY change this. This setting SHOULD NOT be AOR related. 
           
          A SIP UA MUST be able to parse and accept requests containing 
          international characters encoded as UTF-8 even if it cannot 
          display those characters in the user interface. 
   
     4.19 Inbound Authentication 
       
          SIP allows a device to limit incoming signaling to those made 
          by a predefined set of authorized users from a list and/or 
          with valid passwords. Note that the inbound proxy from most 
          service providers may also support the screening of incoming 
          calls, but in some cases users may want to have control in the 
          SIP telephony device for the screening.      
            
          A device SHOULD support the setting as to whether 
          authentication (on the device) is required and what type of 
          authentication is required. 
           
          Example: InboundAuthentication=digest;pattern=* 
              
          If inbound authentication is enabled then a list of allowed 
          users and credentials to call this device MAY be used by the 
          device. The credentials MAY contain the same data as the 
          credentials for an AOR (i.e. URL, user, password digest and 
          domain). This applies to SIP control signaling as well as call 
          initiation.  
   
     4.20 Voice Message Settings 
      
          Various voice message settings require the use of URL's as 
          specified in RFC 3087 [35]. 
           
          The message waiting indicator (MWI) address setting controls 
          where the client SHOULD SUBSCRIBE to a voice message server 
          and what MWI summaries MAY be displayed [43]. 
           
          Example: MWISubscribe=sip:mailbox01@media.proxy.com 
           
          User Agents SHOULD accept MWI notifications without prior 
          subscription. This way the setup of voice message settings can 
          be avoided.  
         
     4.21 Phonebook and Call History 
         
          UA SHOULD have a phonebook and keep a history of recent calls. 
          The phonebook SHOULD save the information in permanent memory 
 
 
   Sinnreich et al.    Expires  February 2005              [Page 23] 
                  SIP Telephony Device Requirements         June 2004 
 
 
          that keeps the information even after restarting the device or 
          save the information in an external database that permanently 
          stores the information. 
   
     4.22 User Related Settings and Mobility 
    
          A device MAY specify the user which is currently registered on 
          the device. This SHOULD be an address-of-record URL specified 
          in a AOR definition.   
                  
          The purpose of specifying which user is currently assigned to 
          this device is to provide the device with the identity of the 
          user whose settings are defined in the user section. This is 
          primarily interesting with regards to user roaming. Devices 
          MAY allow users to sign-on to them and then request that their 
          particular settings be retrieved. Likewise a user MAY stop 
          using a device and want to disable their AOR while not 
          present. For the device to understand what to do it MUST have 
          some way of identifying users and knowing which user is 
          currently using it. By separating the user and device 
          properties it becomes clear what the user wishes to enable or 
          to disable.     
           
          Providing an identifier in the configuration for the user 
          gives an explicit handle for the user. For this to work the 
          device MUST have some way of identifying users and knowing 
          which user is currently assigned to it.      
                  
          One possible scenario for roaming is an agent who has 
          definitions for several AOR (e.g. one or more personal AOR and 
          one for each executive for whom the administrator takes calls) 
          that they are registered for. If the agent goes to the copy 
          room they would sign-on to a device in that room and their 
          user settings including their AOR would roam with them. The 
          alternative to this is to require the agent to individually 
          configure all of the AORs individually (this would be 
          particularly irksome using standard telephone button entry).   
                  
          The management of user profiles, aggregation of user or device 
          AOR and profile information from multiple management sources 
          are configuration server concerns which are out of the scope 
          of this document. However the ability to uniquely identify the 
          device and user within the configuration data enables easier 
          server based as well as local (i.e. on the device) 
          configuration management of the configuration data.     
 
     4.23 AOR Related Settings

                  SIP Telephony Device Requirements         June 2004 
 
 
          SIP telephony devices MUST use the AOR related settings, as 
          specified here. 
               
          AOR Identification                  
           
          There are many properties which MAY be associated with or 
          SHOULD be applied to the AOR or signaling addressed to or from 
          the AOR. AORs MAY be defined for a device or a user of the 
          device. At least one AOR MUST be defined in the settings, this 
          MAY pertain to either the device itself or the user.    
           
          Example: AOR=sip:12345@proxy.com 
                  
          It MUST be possible to specify at least one set of domain, 
          user name and authentication credentials for each AOR. The 
          user name and authentication credentials are used for 
          authentication challenges. 
           
     4.24 Maximum Connections 
        
          A setting defining the maximum number of simultaneous 
          connections that a device can support MUST be used by the 
          device. The end point might have some maximum limit, most 
          likely determined by the media handling capability. The number 
          of simultaneous connections may be also limited by the access 
          bandwidth, such as of DSL, cable and wireless users. Other 
          optional settings MAY include the enabling or disabling of 
          call waiting indication. 
              
          A SIP telephony device MAY support at least two connections 
          for three-way conference calls that are locally hosted. 
           
          Example: MaximumConnections=2;cwi=false;bw=128 
   
     4.25 Automatic Configuration and Upgrade 
   
          Automatic SIP telephony device configuration SHOULD use the 
          processes and requirements described in [60]. 
           
          The user name or the realm in the domain name SHOULD be used 
          by the configuration server to automatically configure the 
          device for individual or group specific settings, without any 
          settings by the user. 
           
          Image and service data upgrades SHOULD also not require any 
          settings by the user. 
   
     4.26 Security Configurations 
   
 
 
   Sinnreich et al.    Expires  February 2005              [Page 25] 
                  SIP Telephony Device Requirements         June 2004 
 
 
          The device configuration usually contains sensitive 
          information that MUST be protected. Examples include 
          authentication information, private address books and call 
          history entries. Because of this, it is RECOMMENDED to use an 
          encrypted transport mechanism for configuration data. Where 
          devices use HTTP this could be TLS [36].  
          For devices which use FTP or TFTP for content delivery this 
          can be achieved using symmetric key encryption.    
                  
          Access to retrieving configuration information is also an 
          important issue. A configuration server SHOULD challenge a 
          subscriber before sending configuration information. 
           
          It is RECOMMENDED not to include passwords through the 
          automatic configuration process. Users SHOULD enter the 
          passwords locally. 
 
     5. Security Considerations  
 
     5.1 Threats and Problem Statement 
    
   While section 2.12 and 2.20 state the minimal security requirements 
   and NAT/firewall traversal that have to be met respectively by SIP 
   telephony devices, developers and network managers have to be aware 
   of the larger context of security for IP telephony, especially for 
   those scenarios where security in other parts of SIP enabled networks 
   may reside. 
    
   Users of SIP telephony devices are exposed to many threats [61] that 
   include but are not limited to fake identity of callers, 
   telemarketing, spam in IM, hijacking of calls, eavesdropping, 
   learning of private information such as the personal phone directory, 
   user accounts and passwords and the personal calling history. Various 
   DOS attacks are possible, such as hanging up on other peoples 
   conversations or contributing to DOS attacks of others. 
    
   Service providers are also exposed to many types of attacks that 
   include but are not limited to theft of service by users with fake 
   identities, DOS attacks and the liabilities due to theft of private 
   customer data and eavesdropping in which poorly secured SIP telephony 
   devices or especially intermediaries such as stateful back-to-back 
   user agents with media (B2BUA) may be implicated. 
    
   SIP security is a hard problem for several reasons:  
     . Peers can communicate across domains without any pre-arranged 
        trust relationship,  
     . There may be many intermediaries in the signaling path,  
     . Multiple endpoints can be involved in such telephony operations 
        as forwarding, forking, transfer or conferencing, 
 
 
   Sinnreich et al.    Expires  February 2005              [Page 26] 
                  SIP Telephony Device Requirements         June 2004 
 
 
     . There are seemingly conflicting service requirements when 
        supporting anonymity, legal intercept, call trace and privacy, 
     . Complications arise from the need to traverse NATs and firewalls. 
    
   There are a large number of deployment scenarios in enterprise 
   networks, using residential networks and employees using VPN access 
   to the corporate network when working from home or on travel. There 
   are different security scenarios for each. The security expectations 
   are also very different, say within an enterprise network or when 
   using a laptop in a public wireless hotspot and it is beyond the 
   scope of this memo to describe all possible scenarios in detail. 
    
   The authors believe that adequate security for SIP telephony devices 
   can be best implemented within protected networks, be they private IP 
   networks or service provider SIP enabled networks where a large part 
   of the security threats listed here are dealt with in the protected 
   network. A more general security discussion that includes network 
   based security features, such as network based assertion of identity 
   [37] and privacy services [38] are outside the scope of this memo, 
   but must be well understood by developers, network managers and 
   service providers. 
    
   In the following some basic security considerations as specified in 
   RFC 3261 are discussed as they apply for SIP telephony devices.  
    
     5.2 SIP Telephony Device Security 
    
   Transport Level Security 
          SIP telephony devices that operate outside the perimeter of 
          secure private IP networks (this includes telecommuters and 
          roaming users connected via a VPN channel to the private IP 
          network) SHOULD use TLS [36] to the outgoing SIP proxy for 
          protection on the first hop. SIP telephony devices that use 
          TLS must support SIPS in the SIP headers. 
          Supporting large numbers of TLS channels to endpoints is quite 
          a burden for service providers and may therefore constitute a 
          premium service feature. 
    
   Digest Authentication 
          SIP telephony devices MUST support digest authentication to 
          register with the outgoing SIP registrar. This assures proper 
          identity credentials that can be conveyed by the network to 
          the called party. It is assumed that the service provider that 
          operates the outgoing SIP registrar has an adequate trust 
          relationship with their users and knows its customers well 
          enough (identity, address, billing relationship, etc.). The 
          exceptions are users of prepaid service. SIP telephony devices 
          that accept prepaid calls MUST place unknown in the From 
          header.

                  SIP Telephony Device Requirements         June 2004 
 
 
           
   End User Certificates 
          SIP telephony devices MAY store personal end user certificates 
          that are part of some PKI [39] service for high security 
          identification to the outgoing SIP registrar as well as for 
          end to end authentication. SIP telephony devices equipped for 
          certificate based authentication MUST also store a key ring of 
          certificates from public certificate authorities (CAs). 
           
   End-to-End Security Using S/MIME 
          S/MIME [40] MAY be used by SIP telephony devices to sign and 
          encrypt portions of the SIP message that are not strictly 
          required for routing by intermediaries. S/MIME protects 
          private information in the SIP bodies and in some SIP headers 
          from intermediaries. The end user certificates required for 
          S/MIME assure the identity of the parties to each other. 
           
   Privacy 
    
   Media Encryption 
          Secure RTP (SRTP) [41] MAY be used for the encryption of media 
          such as audio and video, after the keying information has been 
          passed by SIP signaling. 
          Instant messaging MAY be protected end-to-end using S/MIME. 
           
   Support for NAT and Firewall Traversal 
          The various NAT and firewall traversal scenarios require 
          support in telephony SIP devices. Most scenarios where there 
          are no SIP enabled network edge NAT/firewalls or gateways in 
          the enterprise can be managed if there is a STUN [32] client 
          in the SIP telephony device and a STUN server on the Internet, 
          maintained by a service provider. In some cases an external 
          media relay must also be provided that can support the TURN 
          protocol exchange [62] with SIP telephony devices. Media 
          relays such as TURN come at a high bandwidth cost to the 
          service provider, since the bandwidth for all active SIP 
          telephony devices must be supported. Media relays may also 
          introduce longer paths with additional delays for voice.  
           
          Due to these disadvantages of media relays, it is preferable 
          to avoid symmetric NATs in the network, so that only STUN can 
          be used, where required. 
           
          It is not always obvious to determine the specific NAT and 
          firewall scenario under which a SIP telephony device may 
          operate. For this reason, the support for ICE [63] has been 
          proposed to be deployed in all devices that required end-to-
          end connectivity for SIP signaling and RTP media streams, as

          well as for streaming media using RTSP. ICE makes use of the 
          STUN, TURN and RSIP protocols by using extensions to SDP. 
           
   Call flows using SIP security mechanisms 
          The high level security aspects described here are best 
          illustrated by inspecting the detailed call flows using SIP 
          security, such as in [64]. 
           
  Security enhancements, certificates and identity management 
          As of this writing, recent work in the IETF deals with the SIP 
          authenticated body (AIB) format [66], new S/MIME requirements 
          [67] enhancements for the authenticated identity [68], and 
          certificate management [69]. We recommend developers and 
          network managers to follow this work as it will develop into 
          IETF standards.

     7. Changes from draft-sinnreich-sipdev-req-03 
 
     . This version (0.5) of the memo is focused more narrowly on SIP 
        telephony device requirements and configuration only.  
     . Automatic configuration over the network has been ommitted since 
        it is addressed separately in [60].  
     . The section with the example with XML based configuration data 
        has been omitted, since such data formats are different topic 
        altogether.  
     . The section on security considerations has been re-written from 
        scratch so as to keep up with recent work on SIP security, and 
        such items as user identity, certificates, S/MIME and the SIP 
        Authenticated Body (AIB) format. 
    
   Changes to -02 since draft-sinnreich-sipdev-req-01 
    
     . Re-edited the section on Interactive text support for hearing or 
        speech disabled users. 
     . Shortened the sections on phonebook, call history and line 
        related settings. 
     . Deleted the section on ringer behavior. 
     . Updated and added references.

     9. Acknowledgments 
      
   We would like to thank Jon Peterson for very detailed comments on the 
   previous version 0.3 that has prompted the rewriting of much of this 
   document. Rohan Mahy has contributed several clarifications to the 
   document and leadership in the discussions on support for the hearing 
   disabled. These discussions have been concluded during the BOF on SIP 
   Devices held during the 57th IETF and the conclusions are reflected 
   in the section on interactive text support for hearing or speech 
   disabled users.  
   Arnoud van Wijk and Guido Gybels have been instrumental in driving 
   the specification for support of the hearing disabled.  
    
   The authors would also like to thank numerous persons for 
   contributions and comments to this Internet Draft: Henning 
   Schulzrinne, Jörgen Björkner, Jay Batson, Eric Tremblay, Gunnar

   Hellström, David Oran and Denise Caballero McCann, Brian Rosen, Jean 
   Brierre, Kai Miao, Adrian Lewis and Franz Edler. Jonathan Knight has 
   contributed significantly to earlier versions of parts of this 
   Internet Draft. Peter Baker has also provided valuable pointers to 
   TIA/EIA IS 811 requirements to IP phones that are referenced here. 
    
   Last but not least, the co-authors of the previous versions, Daniel 
   Petrie and Ian Butcher have provided support and guidance all along 
   in the development of these requirements. As mentioned, their 
   contributions are now the focus of separate documents.
