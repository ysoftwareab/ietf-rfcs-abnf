     1. Introduction

     This document describes terminology for the benchmarking of
     devices that implement traffic control based on IP precedence or
     diff-serv code point criteria.

     New terminology is needed because most existing measurements
     assume the absence of congestion and only a single per-hop-
     behavior. This document introduces several new terms that will
     allow measurements to be taken during periods of congestion.

     Another key difference from existing terminology is the definition
     of measurements as observed on egress as well as ingress of a
     device/system under test. Again, the existence of congestion
     requires the addition of egress measurements as well as those
     taken on ingress; without observing traffic leaving a
     device/system it is not possible to say whether traffic-control
     mechanisms effectively dealt with congestion.

     The principal measurements introduced in this document are vectors
     for rate, delay, and jitter, all of which can be observed with or
     without congestion of the DUT/SUT.

  INTERNET-DRAFT       Terminology for Benchmarking        November 2001
                 Network-layer Traffic Control Mechanisms

     This document describes only those terms relevant to measuring
     behavior of a device or a group of devices using one of these two
     mechanisms. End-to-end and service-level measurements are beyond
     the scope of this document.


     2.  Existing definitions

     RFC 1242 "Benchmarking Terminology for Network Interconnect
     Devices" and RFC 2285 "Benchmarking Terminology for LAN Switching
     Devices" should be consulted before attempting to make use of this
     document.

     RFC 2474 "Definition of the Differentiated Services Field (DS
     Field) in the IPv4 and IPv6 Headers" section 2, contains
     discussions of a number of terms relevant to network-layer traffic
     control mechanisms and should also be consulted.

     For the sake of clarity and continuity this RFC adopts the
     template for definitions set out in Section 2 of RFC 1242.
     Definitions are indexed and grouped together in sections for ease
     of reference.

     The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
     NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
     "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
     RFC 2119.


     3. Term definitions

     3.1 Configuration Terms


     3.1.1 Classification

        Definition:
          Selection of packets based on the contents of packet header
          according to defined rules.

        Discussion:
          Packets can be selected based on the DS field or IP
          Precedence in the packet header.  Classification can also be
          based on Multi-Field (MF) criteria such as IP Source and
          destination addresses, protocol and port number.

          Classification determines the per-hop behaviors and traffic
          conditioning functions such as shaping and dropping that are
          to be applied to the packet.

     3.1.2 Codepoint Set

        Definition:
          The set of all DS Code-points or IP precedence values used
          during the test duration.

        Discussion:
          Describes all the code-point markings associated with packets
          that are input to the DUT/SUT.  For each entry in the
          codepoint set, there are associated vectors describing the
          rate of traffic containing that particular DSCP or IP
          precedence value.

          The treatment that a packet belonging to a particular code-
          point gets is subject to the DUT classifying packets to map
          to the correct PHB. Moreover, the forwarding treatment in
          general is also dependent on the complete set of offered
          vectors.

     3.1.3 Congestion

        Definition:
          A condition in which one or more egress interfaces are
          offered more packets than are forwarded at any given instant.

        Discussion:
          This condition is a superset of the overload definition [2].
          The overload definition assumes the congestion is introduced
          strictly by the tester on ingress of a DUT/SUT. That may or
          may not be the case here.

          Another difference is that with multiple-DUT measurements,
          congestion may occur at multiple points. For example,
          multiple edge devices collectively may congest a core device.
          In contrast, overload [1] deals only with overload on
          ingress.



  Perser, Newman, Khurana, Erramilli, Poretsky                  [Page 4]

  INTERNET-DRAFT       Terminology for Benchmarking        November 2001
                 Network-layer Traffic Control Mechanisms

          Ingress observations alone are not sufficient to cover all
          cases in which congestion may occur. A device with an
          infinite amount of memory could buffer an infinite amount of
          packets, and eventually forward all of them. However, these
          packets may or may not be forwarded during the test duration.
          Even though ingress interfaces accept all packets without
          loss, this hypothetical device may still be congested.

          The definition presented here explicitly defines congestion
          as an event observable on egress interfaces. Regardless of
          internal architecture, any device that cannot forward packets
          on one or more egress interfaces is congested.

     3.1.4 Congestion Management

        Definition:
          An implementation of one or more per-hop-behaviors to avoid
          or minimize the condition of congestion.

        Discussion:
          Congestion management may seek either to control congestion
          or avoid it altogether. Such mechanisms classify packets
          based upon IP Precedence or DSCP settings in a packet's IP
          header.

          Congestion avoidance mechanisms seek to prevent congestion
          before it actually occurs.

          Congestion control mechanisms gives one or more service
          classes preferential treatment over other classes during
          periods of congestion.

     3.2 Vectors
          A vector is a group of packets all containing a specific DSCP
          or IP precedence value.  Vectors are expressed as a pair of
          numbers.  The first is being the particular diff-serv value.
          The second is the metric expressed as a rate, loss
          percentage, delay, or jitter.


     3.2.1 Intended Vector

        Definition:

          A vector describing the rate at which packets having a
          specific code-point (or IP precedence) that an external
          source attempts to transmit to a DUT/SUT.

        Discussion:
          Intended loads across the different code-point classes
          determine the metrics associated with a specific code-point
          traffic class.

        Measurement Units:
          N-octets packets per second

          Expected Jitter Vector
          Forwarding Vector
          Loss Vector


     3.2.2 Offered Vector

        Definition:
          A vector describing the measured rate at which packets having
          a specific DSCP or IP precedence value are offered to the
          DUT/SUT.

        Discussion:
          Offered loads across the different code-point classes,
          constituting a code-point set, determine the metrics
          associated with a specific code-point traffic class.

        Measurement Units:

     3.2.3 Expected Vectors


     3.2.3.1 Expected Forwarding Vector

        Definition:
          A vector describing the expected output rate of packets
          having a specific DSCP or IP precedence value.  The value is
          dependent on the set of offered vectors and configuration of
          the DUT.

        Discussion:
          The DUT is configured in a certain way in order that service
          differentiation occurs for behavior aggregates when a
          specific traffic mix consisting of multiple behavior
          aggregates is applied. This term attempts to capture the
          expected forwarding behavior, for which the device is
          configured, when subjected to a certain offered load.

          The actual algorithms or mechanism, that the DUT uses to
          achieve service differentiation, is not important in
          describing the expected vector.

     3.2.3.2 Expected Loss Vector

        Definition:
          A vector describing the percentage of packets, having a
          specific DSCP or IP precedence value, that should not be
          forwarded.  The value is dependent on the set of offered
          vectors and configuration of the DUT.

        Discussion:
          The DUT is configured in a certain way in order that service
          differentiation occurs for behavior aggregates when a
          specific traffic mix consisting of multiple behavior
          aggregates is applied.  This term attempts to capture the
          expected loss behavior, for which the device is configured,
          when subjected to a certain offered load.

          The actual algorithms or mechanism, that the DUT uses to
          achieve service differentiation, is not important in
          describing the expected loss vector.

        Measurement Units:

     3.2.3.3 Expected Sequence Vector

        Definition:
          A vector describing the expected sequencing of packets having
          a specific DSCP or IP precedence value. The value is
          dependent on the set of offered vectors and configuration of
          the DUT.

        Discussion:
          The DUT is configured in a certain way in order that service
          differentiation occurs for behavior aggregates when a

     3.2.3.4 Expected Delay Vector

        Definition:
          A vector describing the expected delay for packets having a
          specific DSCP or IP precedence value. The value is dependent
          on the set of offered vectors and configuration of the DUT.

        Discussion:
          The DUT is configured in a certain way in order that service
          differentiation occurs for behavior aggregates when a

     3.2.3.5 Expected Jitter Vector

        Definition:
          A vector describing the expected variation in the delay of
          packet arrival times for packets having specific DSCP or IP
          precedence value. The value is dependent on the set of
          offered vectors and configuration of the DUT.

        Discussion:
          Jitter is the absolute value of the difference between the
          delay measurement of two packets belonging to the same
          stream.

          The jitter between two consecutive packets in a stream is
          reported as the "instantaneous jitter". Instantaneous jitter
          can be expressed as |D(i) - D(i-1)| where D equals the delay
          and i is the test sequence number.  Packets lost are not
          counted in the jitter measurement.

          Average Jitter is the average of the instantaneous jitter
          measured during the test duration.

          Peak-to-peak jitter is the maximum delay minus the minimum
          delay of the packets forwarded by the DUT/SUT.

        Measurement units:
          Seconds (instantaneous)
          Seconds P-P (peak to peak)
          Seconds Avg (average)

     3.2.4.1 Forwarding Vector

        Definition:
          The number of packets per second for all packets containing a
          specific DSCP or IP precedence value that a device can be
          observed to successfully transmit to the correct destination
          interface in response to an offered vector.

        Discussion:
          Forwarding Vector is expressed as pair of numbers.  Both the
          specific DSCP (or IP precedence) value AND the packets per
          second value combine to make a vector.

          The Forwarding Vector represents packet rate based on its
          specific DSCP (or IP precedence) value.  It is not
          necessarily based on a stream or flow.  The Forwarding Vector
          may be expressed as per port of the DUT/SUT. However, it must
          be consistent with the Expected Forwarding Vector.

          Forwarding Vector is a per-hop measurement.  The DUT/SUT may
          change the specific DSCP (or IP precedence) value for a
          multiple-hop measurement.

          observed to transmit out of sequence to the correct

     3.2.4.4 Delay Vector

        Definition:
          The delay for packets containing specific DSCP or IP
          precedence value that a device can be observed to
          successfully transmit to the correct destination interface in
          response to an offered vector.

        Discussion:
          Delay vector is expressed as pair of numbers.  Both the
          specific DSCP (or IP precedence) value AND delay value
          combine to make a vector.

          The Delay Vector represents delay on its specific DSCP or IP
          precedence value.  It is not necessarily based on a stream or
          flow.  The Delay vector may be expressed as per port of the
          DUT/SUT.  However, it must be consistent with the Expected
          Delay vector.

          Delay vector is measured similarly regardless of the type of
          DUT/SUT.  Latency [1] require some knowledge of whether the
          DUT/SUT is a "store and forward" or a "bit forwarding"
          device.  The fact that a DUT/SUT's technology has a lower
          delay than another technology should be visible.

          Delay Vector is a per-hop measurement.  The DUT/SUT may
          change the specific DSCP or IP precedence value for a
          multiple-hop measurement.

          Delay vector can be obtained at any offered load.  Recommend
          at or below the channel capacity in the absence of
          congestion.  For congested delay, run the offered load above
          the channel capacity.

     3.2.4.5 Jitter Vector

        Definition:
          The variation in the delay for packets containing specific
          DSCP or IP precedence value that a device can be observed to
          successfully transmit to the correct destination interface in
          response to an offered vector.

        Discussion:
          Jitter is the absolute value of the difference between the
          delay measurement of two packets belonging to the same
          stream.

          Jitter vector is expressed as pair of numbers.  Both the
          specific DSCP (or IP precedence) value AND jitter value
          combine to make a vector.

          The jitter between two consecutive packets in a stream is
          reported as the "instantaneous jitter". Instantaneous jitter
          can be expressed as |D(i) - D(i-1)| where D equals the delay
          and i is the test sequence number.  Packets lost are not
          counted in the jitter measurement.

          Jitter vector is a per-hop measurement.  The DUT/SUT may
          change the specific DSCP or IP precedence value for a
          multiple-hop measurement.

          Average Jitter is the average of the instantaneous jitter
          measured during the test duration.

          Peak-to-peak Jitter is the maximum delay minus the minimum
          delay of the packets forwarded by the DUT/SUT.

        Measurement units:
          Seconds (instantaneous)

     3.3 Measurement Terms


     3.3.1 Channel Capacity

        Definition:
          The maximum forwarding rate [2] at which none of the offered
          packets are dropped by the DUT/SUT.

        Discussion:
          Channel capacity measures the packet rate at the egress
          interface(s) of the DUT/SUT. In contrast, throughput as
          defined in RFC 1242 measures the packet rate is based on the
          ingress interface(s) of the DUT/SUT.

          Ingress-based measurements do not account for congestion of
          the DUT/SUT. Channel capacity, as an egress measurement, does
          take congestion into account.

          Understanding channel capacity is a necessary precursor to
          any measurement involving congestion.  Throughput numbers can
          be higher than channel capacity because of queueing.

          This measurement differs from forwarding rate at maximum
          offered load (FRMOL) [2] in that it is intolerant of loss.

           N-octet packets per second

          Packets which lie within specific rate, delay, or jitter
          bounds.

        Discussion:
          A DUT/SUT may be configured to allow a given traffic class to
          consume a given amount of bandwidth, or to fall within

          consume a given amount of bandwidth, or to fall within

          not lie within these bounds are then said to be

     3.3.4 Delay

        Definition:
          The time interval starting when the last bit of the input IP
          packets reaches the input port of the DUT/SUT and ending when
          the last bit of the output IP packets is seen on the output
          port of the DUT/SUT.

        Discussion:

  Perser, Newman, Khurana, Erramilli, Poretsky                 [Page 16]

  INTERNET-DRAFT       Terminology for Benchmarking        November 2001
                 Network-layer Traffic Control Mechanisms

          Delay is measured the same regardless of the type of DUT/SUT.
          Latency [1] require some knowledge of whether the DUT/SUT is
          a "store and forward" or a "bit forwarding" device.  The fact
          that a DUT/SUT's technology has a lower delay than another
          technology should be visible.

          By specifying the metric to be inside the Internet protocol,
          the tester is relieved from specifying the start/end for
          every data link layer protocol that IP runs on.  This avoids
          determining if the start/end delimiter are included in the
          frame.  Also heterogeneous data link protocol can be used in
          a test.

          The measurement point at the end is closely simulates the way
          an internet datagram is processed.  An internet datagram is
          not passed up or down the stack unless it is complete.
          Completion occurs once the last bit of the IP packet has been
          received.

          Delay can be run at any offered load.  Recommend at or below
          the channel capacity for non-congested delay.  For congested
          delay, run the offered load above the channel capacity.

     3.3.5 Flow

        Definition:
          A flow is a one or more of packets sharing a common intended
          pair of source and destination interfaces.

        Discussion:
          Packets are grouped by the ingress and egress interfaces they
          use on a given DUT/SUT.

          A flow can contain multiple source IP addresses and/or
          destination IP addresses.  All packets in a flow must enter
          on the same ingress interface and exit on the same egress
          interface, and have some common network layer content.

          Microflows [3] are a subset of flows.  As defined in [3],
          microflows require application-to-application measurement. In
          contrast, flows use lower-layer classification criteria.
          Since this document focuses on network-layer classification

  Perser, Newman, Khurana, Erramilli, Poretsky                 [Page 17]

  INTERNET-DRAFT       Terminology for Benchmarking        November 2001

          criteria, we concentrate here on the use of network-layer
          identifiers in describing a flow. Flow identifiers also may
          reside at the data-link, transport, or application layers of
          the ISO model. However, identifiers other than those at the
          network layer are out of scope for this document.

          A flow may contain a single code point/IP precedence value or
          may contain multiple values destined for a single egress
          interface.  This is determined by the test methodology.

     3.3.6 Stream

        Definition:
          A group of packets tracked as a single entity by the traffic
          receiver.  A stream may share a common content such as type
          (IP, UDP), packet size, or payload.

        Discussion:
          Streams are tracked by Test sequence number or "unique
          signature field" (RFC 2889).  Streams define how individual
          packet's statistics are grouped together to form an
          intelligible summary.

          Common stream groupings would be by egress interface,
          destination address, source address, DSCP, or IP precedence.
          A stream using Test sequence numbers can track the ordering
          of packets as they transverse the DUT/SUT.

          Streams are not restricted to a pair of source and
          destination interfaces as long as all packets are tracked as
          a single entity.  A mulitcast stream can be forward to
          multiple destination interfaces.

     3.3.7 Test Sequence number

        Definition:
          A field in the IP payload portion of the packet that is used
          to verify the order of the packets on the egress of the
          DUT/SUT.

        Discussion:
          The traffic generator sets the Test sequence number value and
          the traffic receiver checks the value upon receipt of the
          packet.  The traffic generator changes the value on each
          packet transmitted based on an algorithm agreed to by the
          traffic receiver.

          The traffic receiver keeps track of the sequence numbers on a
          per stream basis.  In addition to number of received packets,
          the traffic receiver may also report number of in-sequence
          packets, number of out-sequence packets, number of duplicate
          packets, and number of reordered packets.

          The recommended algorithm to use to change the sequence
          number on sequential packets is an incrementing value.

     3.3.8 Undifferentiated Response

        Definition:
          The vector(s) obtained when mechanisms used to support diff-
          serv or IP precedence are disabled.

        Discussion:
          Enabling diff-serv or IP precedence mechanisms may impose
          additional processing overhead for packets. This overhead may
          degrade performance even when traffic belonging to only one
          class, the best-effort class, is offered to the device.

          Measurements with "undifferentiated response" should be made
          to establish a baseline.

          The vector(s) obtained with DSCPs or IP precedence enabled
          can be compared to the undifferentiated response to determine
          the effect of differentiating traffic.

     4. Security Considerations

          Documents of this type do not directly affect the security of
          the Internet or of corporate networks as long as benchmarking
          is not performed on devices or systems connected to operating
          networks.

          Packets with unintended and/or unauthorized DSCP or IP
          precedence values may present security issues. Determining
          the security consequences of such packets is out of scope for
          this document.
