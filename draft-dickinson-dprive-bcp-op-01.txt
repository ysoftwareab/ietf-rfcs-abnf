           Recommendations for DNS Privacy Service Operators
                    draft-dickinson-dprive-bcp-op-01

Abstract

   This document presents operational, policy and security
   considerations for DNS operators who choose to offer DNS Privacy
   services.  With the recommendations, the operator can make deliberate
   decisions which services to provide, and how the decisions and
   alternatives impact the privacy of users.

   This document also presents a framework to assist writers of DNS
   Privacy Policy and Practices Statements (analogous to DNS Security
   Extensions (DNSSEC) Policies and DNSSEC Practice Statements described
   in [RFC6841]).

1.  Introduction

   [NOTE: This document is submitted to the IETF for initial review and
   for feedback on the best forum for future versions of this document.
   Initial considerations for DoH [I-D.ietf-doh-dns-over-https] are
   included here in anticipation of that draft progressing to be an RFC
   but further analysis is required.]

   The Domain Name System (DNS) is at the core of the Internet; almost
   every activity on the Internet starts with a DNS query (and often
   several).  However the DNS was not originally designed with strong
   security or privacy mechanisms.  A number of developments have taken
   place in recent years which aim to increase the privacy of the DNS
   system and these are now seeing some deployment.  This latest
   evolution of the DNS presents new challenges to operators and this
   document attempts to provide an overview of considerations for
   privacy focussed DNS services.

   In recent years there has also been an increase in the availability
   of "open resolvers" [I-D.ietf-dnsop-terminology-bis] which users may
   prefer to use instead of the default network resolver because they
   offer a specific feature (e.g. good reachability, encrypted
   transport, strong privacy policy, filtering (or lack of), etc.).
   These open resolvers have tended to be at the forefront of adoption



Dickinson, et al.       Expires January 17, 2019                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft     DNS Privacy Service Recommendations         July 2018


   of privacy related enhancements but it is anticipated that operators
   of other resolver services will follow.

   Whilst protocols that encrypt DNS messages on the wire provide
   protection against certain attacks, the resolver operator still has
   (in principle) full visibility of the query data and transport
   identifiers for each user.  Therefore, a trust relationship exists.
   The ability of the operator to provide a transparent, well
   documented, and secure privacy service will likely serve as a major
   differentiating factor for privacy conscious users if they make an
   active selection of which resolver to use.

   It should also be noted that the choice of a user to configure a
   single resolver (or a fixed set of resolvers) and an encrypted
   transport to use in all network environments has both advantages and
   disadvantages.  For example the user has a clear expectation of which
   resolvers have visibility of their query data however this resolver/
   transport selection may provide an added mechanism to track them as
   they move across network environments.  Commitments from operators to
   minimize such tracking are also likely to play a role in users
   selection of resolver.

   More recently the global legislative landscape with regard to
   personal data collection, retention, and pseudonymization has seen
   significant activity with differing requirements active in different
   jurisdictions.  For example the user of a service and the service
   itself may be in jurisdictions with conflicting legislation.  It is
   an untested area that simply using a DNS resolution service
   constitutes consent from the user for the operator to process their
   query data.  The impact of recent legislative changes on data
   pertaining to the users of both Internet Service Providers and DNS
   open resolvers is not fully understood at the time of writing.

   This document has two main goals:

   o  To provide operational and policy guidance related to DNS over
      encrypted transports and to outline recommendations for data
      handling for operators of DNS privacy services.

   o  To introduce the DNS Privacy Policy and Practice Statement (DPPPS)
      and present a framework to assist writers of this document.  A
      DPPPS is a document that an operator can publish outlining their
      operational practices and commitments with regard to privacy
      thereby providing a means for clients to evaluate the privacy
      properties of a given DNS privacy service.  In particular, the
      framework identifies the elements that should be considered in
      formulating a DPPPS.  This document does not, however, define a




Dickinson, et al.       Expires January 17, 2019                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft     DNS Privacy Service Recommendations         July 2018


      particular Policy or Practice Statement, nor does it seek to
      provide legal advice or recommendations as to the contents.

   Community insight [or judgment?] about operational practices can
   change quickly, and experience shows that a Best Current Practice
   (BCP) document about privacy and security is a point-in-time
   statement.  Readers are advised to seek out any errata or updates
   that apply to this document.

2.  Scope

   "DNS Privacy Considerations" [I-D.bortzmeyer-dprive-rfc7626-bis]
   describes the general privacy issues and threats associated with the
   use of the DNS by Internet users and much of the threat analysis here
   is lifted from that document and from [RFC6873].  However this
   document is limited in scope to best practice considerations for the
   provision of DNS privacy services by servers (recursive resolvers) to
   clients (stub resolvers or forwarders).  Privacy considerations
   specifically from the perspective of an end user, or those for
   operators of authoritative nameservers are out of scope.

   This document includes (but is not limited to) considerations in the
   following areas (taken from [I-D.bortzmeyer-dprive-rfc7626-bis]):

   1.  Data "on the wire" between a client and a server

   2.  Data "at rest" on a server (e.g. in logs)

   3.  Data "sent onwards" from the server (either on the wire or shared
       with a third party)

   Whilst the issues raised here are targeted at those operators who
   choose to offer a DNS privacy service, considerations for areas 2 and
   3 could equally apply to operators who only offer DNS over
   unencrypted transports but who would like to align with privacy best
   practice.

3.  Privacy related documents

   There are various documents that describe protocol changes that have
   the potential to either increase or decrease the privacy of the DNS.
   Note this does not imply that some documents are good or bad, better
   or worse, just that (for example) some features may bring functional
   benefits at the price of a reduction in privacy and conversely some
   features increase privacy with an accompanying increase in
   complexity.  A selection of the most relevant documents are listed in
   Appendix A for reference.

4.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Privacy terminology is as described in Section 3 of [RFC6973].

   DNS terminology is as described in [I-D.ietf-dnsop-terminology-bis]
   with one modification: we use the definition of Privacy-enabling DNS
   server taken from [RFC8310]:

   o  Privacy-enabling DNS server: A DNS server (most likely a full-
      service resolver) that implements DNS-over-TLS [RFC7858], and may
      optionally implement DNS-over-DTLS [RFC8094].  The server should
      also offer at least one of the credentials described in Section 8
      and implement the (D)TLS profile described in Section 9.

   TODO: Update the definition of Privacy-enabling DNS server in
   [I-D.ietf-dnsop-terminology-bis] to be complete and also include DoH,
   then reference that here.

   o  DPPPS: DNS Privacy Policy and Practice Statement, see Section 6.

   o  DNS privacy service: The service that is offered via a privacy-
      enabling DNS server and is documented either in an informal
      statement of policy and practice with regard to users privacy or a
      formal DPPPS.

5.  Recommendations for DNS privacy services

   We describe three classes of actions that operators of DNS privacy
   services can take:

   o  Threat mitigation for well understood and documented privacy
      threats to the users of the service and in some cases to the
      operators of the service.

   o  Optimization of privacy services from an operational or management
      perspective

   o  Additional options that could further enhance the privacy and
      usability of the service






Dickinson, et al.       Expires January 17, 2019                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft     DNS Privacy Service Recommendations         July 2018


   This document does not specify policy only best practice, however for
   DNS Privacy services to be considered compliant with these best
   practice guidelines they SHOULD implement (where appropriate) all:

   o  Threat mitigations to be minimally compliant

   o  Optimizations to be moderately compliant

   o  Additional options to be maximally compliant

   TODO: Some of the threats listed in the following sections are taken
   directly from Section 5 of RFC6973, some are just standalone
   descriptions, we need to go through all of them and see if we can use
   the RFC6973 threats where possible and make them consistent.

5.1.  On the wire between client and server

   In this section we consider both data on the wire and the service
   provided to the client.

5.1.1.  Transport recommendations

   Threats:

   o  Surveillance: Passive surveillance of traffic on the wire

   o  Intrusion: Active injection of spurious data or traffic

   Mitigations:

   A DNS privacy service can mitigate these threats by providing service
   over one or more of the following transports

   o  DNS-over-TLS [RFC7858]

   o  DoH [I-D.ietf-doh-dns-over-https]

   Additional options:

   o  A DNS privacy service can also be provided over DNS-over-DTLS
      [RFC8094], however note that this is an Experimental
      specification.

   It is noted that DNS privacy service might be provided over IPSec,
   DNSCrypt or VPNs.  However, use of these transports for DNS are not
   standardized and any discussion of best practice for providing such
   service is out of scope for this document.

Internet-Draft     DNS Privacy Service Recommendations         July 2018


5.1.2.  Authentication of DNS privacy services

   Threats:

   o  Surveillance and Intrusion: Active attacks that can redirect
      traffic to rogue servers

   Mitigations:

   DNS privacy services should ensure clients can authenticate the
   server.  Note that this, in effect, commits the DNS privacy service
   to a public identity users will trust.

   When using DNS-over-TLS clients that select a 'Strict Privacy' usage
   profile [RFC8310] (to mitigate the threat of active attack on the
   client) require the ability to authenticate the DNS server.  To
   enable this, DNS privacy services that offer DNS-over-TLS should
   provide credentials in the form of either X.509 certificates, SPKI
   pinsets or TLSA records.

   When offering DoH [I-D.ietf-doh-dns-over-https], HTTPS requires
   authentication of the server as part of the protocol.

   Optimizations:

   DNS privacy services can also consider the following capabilities/
   options:

   o  As recommended in [RFC8310] providing DANE TLSA records for the
      nameserver

      *  In particular, the service could provide TLSA records such that
         authenticating solely via the PKIX infrastructure can be
         avoided.

   o  Implementing [I-D.ietf-tls-dnssec-chain-extension]

      *  This can decrease the latency of connection setup to the server
         and remove the need for the client to perform meta-queries to
         obtain and validate the DANE records.

5.1.2.1.  Certificate management

   Anecdotal evidence to date highlights the management of certificates
   as one of the more challenging aspects for operators of traditional
   DNS resolvers that choose to additionally provide a DNS privacy
   service as management of such credentials is new to those DNS
   operators.



Dickinson, et al.       Expires January 17, 2019                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft     DNS Privacy Service Recommendations         July 2018


   It is noted that SPKI pinset management is described in [RFC7858] but
   that key pinning mechanisms in general have fallen out of favour
   operationally for various reasons.

   Threats:

   o  Invalid certificates, resulting in an unavailable service.

   o  Mis-identification of a server by a client e.g. typos in URLs or
      authentication domain names

   Mitigations:

   It is recommended that operators:

   o  Choose a short, memorable authentication name for their service

   o  Automate the generation and publication of certificates

   o  Monitor certificates to prevent accidental expiration of
      certificates

   TODO: Could we provide references for certificate management best
   practice, for example Section 6.5 of RFC7525?

5.1.3.  Protocol recommendations

5.1.3.1.  DNS-over-TLS

   Threats:

   o  Known attacks on TLS (TODO: add a reference)

   o  Traffic analysis (TODO: add a reference)

   o  Potential for client tracking via transport identifiers

   o  Blocking of well known ports (e.g. 853 for DNS-over-TLS)

   Mitigations:

   In the case of DNS-over-TLS, TLS profiles from Section 9 and the
   Countermeasures to DNS Traffic Analysis from section 11.1 of
   [RFC8310] provide strong mitigations.  This includes but is not
   limited to:

   o  Adhering to [RFC7525]




Dickinson, et al.       Expires January 17, 2019                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft     DNS Privacy Service Recommendations         July 2018


   o  Implementing only (D)TLS 1.2 or later as specified in [RFC8310]

   o  Implementing EDNS(0) Padding [RFC7830] using the guidelines in
      [I-D.ietf-dprive-padding-policy]

   o  Clients should not be required to use TLS session resumption
      [RFC5077], Domain Name System (DNS) Cookies [RFC7873].

   o  A DNS-over-TLS privacy service on both port 853 and 443.  We note
      that this practice may require revision when DoH becomes more
      widely deployed, because of the potential use of the same ports
      for two incompatible types of service.

   Optimizations:

   o  Concurrent processing of pipelined queries, returning responses as
      soon as available, potentially out of order as specified in
      [RFC7766].  This is often called 'OOOR' - out-of-order responses.
      (Providing processing performance similar to HTTP multiplexing)

   o  Management of TLS connections to optimize performance for clients
      using either

      *  [RFC7766] and EDNS(0) Keepalive [RFC7828] and/or

      *  DNS Stateful Operations [I-D.ietf-dnsop-session-signal]

   Additional options that providers may consider:

   o  Offer a .onion [RFC7686] service endpoint

5.1.3.2.  DoH

   TODO: Fill this in, a lot of overlap with DNS-over-TLS but we need to
   address DoH specific ones if possible.

   Mitigations:

   o  Clients should not be required to use HTTP Cookies [RFC6265].

   o  Clients should not be required to include any headers beyond the
      absolute minimum to obtain service from a DoH server.

5.1.4.  Availability

   Threats:





Dickinson, et al.       Expires January 17, 2019               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft     DNS Privacy Service Recommendations         July 2018


   o  A failed DNS privacy service could force the user to switch
      providers, fallback to cleartext or accept no DNS service for the
      outage.

   Mitigations:

   A DNS privacy service must be engineered for high availability.
   Particular care should to be taken to protect DNS privacy services
   against denial-of-service attacks, as experience has shown that
   unavailability of DNS resolving because of attacks is a significant
   motivation for users to switch services.

   TODO: Add reference to ongoing research on this topic.

5.1.5.  Service options

   Threats:

   o  Unfairly disadvantaging users of the privacy service with respect
      to the services available.  This could force the user to switch
      providers, fallback to cleartext or accept no DNS service for the
      outage.

   Mitigations:

   A DNS privacy service should deliver the same level of service
   offered on un-encrypted channels in terms of such options as
   filtering (or lack of), DNSSEC validation, etc.

5.1.6.  Limitations of using a pure TLS proxy

   Optimization:

   Some operators may choose to implement DNS-over-TLS using a TLS proxy
   (e.g.  nginx [1], haproxy [2] or stunnel [3]) in front of a DNS
   nameserver because of proven robustness and capacity when handling
   large numbers of client connections, load balancing capabilities and
   good tooling.  Currently, however, because such proxies typically
   have no specific handling of DNS as a protocol over TLS or DTLS using
   them can restrict traffic management at the proxy layer and at the
   DNS server.  For example, all traffic received by a nameserver behind
   such a proxy will appear to originate from the proxy and DNS
   techniques such as ACLs, RRL or DNS64 will be hard or impossible to
   implement in the nameserver.

   Operators may choose to use a DNS aware proxy such as dnsdist.

5.2.  Data at rest on the server

5.2.1.  Data handling

   Threats:

   o  Surveillance

   o  Stored data compromise

   o  Correlation

   o  Identification

   o  Secondary use

   o  Disclosure

   o  Contravention of legal requirements not to process user data?

   Mitigations:

   The following are common activities for DNS service operators and in
   all cases should be minimized or completely avoided if possible for
   DNS privacy services.  If data is retained it should be encrypted and
   either aggregated, pseudonymized or anonymized whenever possible.  In
   general the principle of data minimization described in [RFC6973]
   should be applied.

   o  Transient data (e.g. that is used for real time monitoring and
      threat analysis which might be held only memory) should be
      retained for the shortest possible period deemed operationally
      feasible.

   o  The retention period of DNS traffic logs should be only those
      required to sustain operation of the service and, to the extent
      that such exists, meet regulatory requirements.

   o  DNS privacy services should not track users except for the
      particular purpose of detecting and remedying technically
      malicious (e.g.  DoS) or anomalous use of the service.

   o  Data access should be minimized to only those personal who require
      access to perform operational duties.

5.2.2.  Data minimization of network traffic

   Data minimization refers to collecting, using, disclosing, and
   storing the minimal data necessary to perform a task, and this can be
   achieved by removing or obfuscating privacy-sensitive information in
   network traffic logs.  This is typically personal data, or data that
   can be used to link a record to an individual, but may also include
   revealing other confidential information, for example on the
   structure of an internal corporate network.

   The problem of effectively ensuring that DNS traffic logs contain no
   or minimal privacy-sensitive information is not one that currently
   has a generally agreed solution or any Standards to inform this
   discussion.  This section presents and overview of current techniques
   to simply provide reference on the current status of this work.

   Research into data minimization techniques (and particularly IP
   address pseudonymization/anonymization) was sparked in the late
   1990s/early 2000s, partly driven by the desire to share significant
   corpuses of traffic captures for research purposes.  Several
   techniques reflecting different requirements in this area and
   different performance/resource tradeoffs emerged over the course of
   the decade.  Developments over the last decade have been both a
   blessing and a curse; the large increase in size between an IPv4 and
   an IPv6 address, for example, renders some techniques impractical,
   but also makes available a much larger amount of input entropy, the
   better to resist brute force re-identification attacks that have
   grown in practicality over the period.

   Techniques employed may be broadly categorized as either
   anonymization or pseudonymization.  The following discussion uses the
   definitions from [RFC6973] Section 3, with additional observations
   from van Dijkhuizen et al. [4]

   o  Anonymization.  To enable anonymity of an individual, there must
      exist a set of individuals that appear to have the same
      attribute(s) as the individual.  To the attacker or the observer,
      these individuals must appear indistinguishable from each other.

   o  Pseudonymization.  The true identity is deterministically replaced
      with an alternate identity (a pseudonym).  When the
      pseudonymization schema is known, the process can be reversed, so
      the original identity becomes known again.

   In practice there is a fine line between the two; for example, how to
   categorize a deterministic algorithm for data minimization of IP
   addresses that produces a group of pseudonyms for a single given
   address.

5.2.3.  IP address pseudonymization and anonymization methods

   As [I-D.bortzmeyer-dprive-rfc7626-bis] makes clear, the big privacy
   risk in DNS is connecting DNS queries to an individual and the major
   vector for this in DNS traffic is the client IP address.

   There is active discussion in the space of effective pseudonymization
   of IP addresses in DNS traffic logs, however there seems to be no
   single solution that is widely recognized as suitable for all or most
   use cases.  There are also as yet no standards for this that are
   unencumbered by patents.  This following table presents a high level
   comparison of various techniques employed or under development today
   and classifies them according to categorization of technique and
   other properties.  The list of techniques includes the main
   techniques in current use, but does not claim to be comprehensive.
   Appendix B provides a more detailed survey of these techniques and
   definitions for the categories and properties listed below.

   Figure showing comparison of IP address techniques (SVG) [5]

   The choice of which method to use for a particular application will
   depend on the requirements of that application and consideration of
   the threat analysis of the particular situation.

   For example, a common goal is that distributed packet captures must
   be in an existing data format such as PCAP [pcap] or C-DNS
   [I-D.ietf-dnsop-dns-capture-format] that can be used as input to
   existing analysis tools.  In that case, use of a Format-preserving
   technique is essential.  This, though, is not cost-free - several
   authors (e.g.  Brenker & Arnes [6]) have observed that, as the
   entropy in a IPv4 address is limited, given a de-identified log from
   a target, if an attacker is capable of ensuring packets are captured
   by the target and the attacker can send forged traffic with arbitrary
   source and destination addresses to that target, any format-
   preserving pseudonymization is vulnerable to an attack along the
   lines of a cryptographic chosen plaintext attack.

5.2.4.  Pseudonymization, anonymization or discarding of other
        correlation data

   Threats:

   o  IP TTL/Hoplimit can be used to fingerprint client OS

   o  Tracking of TCP sessions

   o  Tracking of TLS sessions and session resumption mechanisms

   o  Resolvers _might_ receive client identifiers e.g.  MAC addresses
      in EDNS(0) options - some CPE devices are known to add them.

   o  HTTP headers

   Mitigations:

   o  Data minimization or discarding of such correlation data

   TODO: More analysis here.

5.2.5.  Cache snooping

   Threats:

   o  Profiling of client queries by malicious third parties

   Mitigations:

   TODO: Describe techniques to defend against cache snooping

5.3.  Data sent onwards from the server

   In this section we consider both data sent on the wire in upstream
   queries and data shared with third parties.

5.3.1.  Protocol recommendations

   Threats:

   o  Transmission of identifying data upstream.

   Mitigations:

   As specified in [RFC8310] for DNS-over-TLS but applicable to any DNS
   Privacy services the server should:

   o  Implement QNAME minimization [RFC7816]

   o  Honour a SOURCE PREFIX-LENGTH set to 0 in a query containing the
      EDNS(0) Client Subnet (ECS) option and not send an ECS option in
      upstream queries.

   Optimizations:

   o  The server should either

      *  not use the ECS option in upstream queries at all, or



Dickinson, et al.       Expires January 17, 2019               [Page 15]

Internet-Draft     DNS Privacy Service Recommendations         July 2018


      *  offer alternative services, one that sends ECS and one that
         does not.

   If operators do offer a service that sends the ECS options upstream
   they should use the shortest prefix that is operationally feasible
   (NOTE: the authors believe they will be able to add a reference for
   advice here soon) and ideally use a policy of whitelisting upstream
   servers to send ECS to in order to minimize data leakage.  Operators
   should make clear in any policy statement what prefix length they
   actually send and the specific policy used.

   Additional options:

   o  Aggressive Use of DNSSEC-Validated Cache [RFC8198] to reduce the
      number of queries to authoritative servers to increase privacy.

   o  Run a copy of the root zone on loopback [RFC7706] to avoid making
      queries to the root servers that might leak information.

5.3.2.  Client query obfuscation

   Additional options:

   Since queries from recursive resolvers to authoritative servers are
   performed using cleartext (at the time of writing), resolver services
   need to consider the extent to which they may be directly leaking
   information about their client community via these upstream queries
   and what they can do to mitigate this further.  Note, that even when
   all the relevant techniques described above are employed there may
   still be attacks possible, e.g.  [Pitfalls-of-DNS-Encryption].  For
   example, a resolver with a very small community of users risks
   exposing data in this way and OUGHT obfuscate this traffic by mixing
   it with 'generated' traffic to make client characterization harder.
   The resolver could also employ aggressive pre-fetch techniques as a
   further measure to counter traffic analysis.

   At the time of writing there are no standardized or widely recognized
   techniques to preform such obfuscation or bulk pre-fetches.

   Another technique that particularly small operators may consider is
   forwarding local traffic to a larger resolver (with a privacy policy
   that aligns with their own practices) over an encrypted protocol so
   that the upstream queries are obfuscated among those of the large
   resolver.

5.3.3.  Data sharing

   Threats:

   o  Surveillance

   o  Stored data compromise

   o  Correlation

   o  Identification

   o  Secondary use

   o  Disclosure

   o  Contravention of legal requirements not to process user data?

   Mitigations:

   Operators should not provide identifiable data to third-parties
   without explicit consent from clients (we take the stance here that
   simply using the resolution service itself does not constitute
   consent).

   Even when consent is granted operators should employ data
   minimization techniques such as those described in Section 5.2.1 if
   data is shared with third-parties.

   Operators should consider including specific guidelines for the
   collection of aggregated and/or anonymized data for research
   purposes, within or outside of their own organization.

   TODO: More on data for research vs operations... how to still
   motivate operators to share anonymized data?

   TODO: Guidelines for when consent is granted?

   TODO: Applies to server data handling too.. could operators offer
   alternatives services one that implies consent for data processing,
   one that doesn't?

Appendix A.  Documents

   This section provides an overview of some DNS privacy related
   documents, however, this is neither an exhaustive list nor a
   definitive statement on the characteristic of the document.

A.1.  Potential increases in DNS privacy

   These documents are limited in scope to communications between stub
   clients and recursive resolvers:

   o  'Specification for DNS over Transport Layer Security (TLS)'
      [RFC7858], referred to here as 'DNS-over-TLS'.

Internet-Draft     DNS Privacy Service Recommendations         July 2018


   o  'DNS over Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)' [RFC8094],
      referred to here as 'DNS-over-DTLS'.  Note that this document has
      the Category of Experimental.

   o  'DNS Queries over HTTPS (DoH)' [I-D.ietf-doh-dns-over-https]
      referred to here as DoH.

   o  'Usage Profiles for DNS over TLS and DNS over DTLS' [RFC8310]

   o  'The EDNS(0) Padding Option' [RFC7830] and 'Padding Policy for
      EDNS(0)' [I-D.ietf-dprive-padding-policy]

   These documents apply to recursive to authoritative DNS but are
   relevant when considering the operation of a recursive server:

   o  'DNS Query Name minimization to Improve Privacy' [RFC7816]
      referred to here as 'QNAME minimization'

A.2.  Potential decreases in DNS privacy

   These documents relate to functionality that could provide increased
   tracking of user activity as a side effect:

   o  'Client Subnet in DNS Queries' [RFC7871]

   o  'Domain Name System (DNS) Cookies' [RFC7873])

   o  'Transport Layer Security (TLS) Session Resumption without Server-
      Side State' [RFC5077] referred to here as simply TLS session
      resumption.

   o  'A DNS Packet Capture Format' [I-D.ietf-dnsop-dns-capture-format]

   o  Passive DNS [I-D.ietf-dnsop-terminology-bis]

   Note that depending on the specifics of the implementation
   [I-D.ietf-doh-dns-over-https] may also provide increased tracking.

A.3.  Related operational documents

   o  'DNS Transport over TCP - Implementation Requirements' [RFC7766]

   o  'Operational requirements for DNS-over-TCP'
      [I-D.ietf-dnsop-dns-tcp-requirements]

   o  'The edns-tcp-keepalive EDNS0 Option' [RFC7828]

   o  'DNS Stateful Operations' [I-D.ietf-dnsop-session-signal]

Appendix B.  IP address techniques

   Data minimization methods may be categorized by the processing used
   and the properties of their outputs.  The following builds on the
   categorization employed in [RFC6235]:

   o  Format-preserving.  Normally when encrypting, the original data
      length and patterns in the data should be hidden from an attacker.
      Some applications of de-identification, such as network capture
      de-identification, require that the de-identified data is of the
      same form as the original data, to allow the data to be parsed in
      the same way as the original.

   o  Prefix preservation.  Values such as IP addresses and MAC
      addresses contain prefix information that can be valuable in
      analysis, e.g. manufacturer ID in MAC addresses, subnet in IP
      addresses.  Prefix preservation ensures that prefixes are de-
      identified consistently; e.g. if two IP addresses are from the
      same subnet, a prefix preserving de-identification will ensure
      that their de-identified counterparts will also share a subnet.
      Prefix preservation may be fixed (i.e. based on a user selected
      prefix length identified in advance to be preserved ) or general.

   o  Replacement.  A one-to-one replacement of a field to a new value
      of the same type, for example using a regular expression.

   o  Filtering.  Removing (and thus truncating) or replacing data in a
      field.  Field data can be overwritten, often with zeros, either
      partially (grey marking) or completely (black marking).

   o  Generalization.  Data is replaced by more general data with
      reduced specificity.  One example would be to replace all TCP/UDP
      port numbers with one of two fixed values indicating whether the
      original port was ephemeral (>=1024) or non-ephemeral (>1024).
      Another example, precision degradation, reduces the accuracy of
      e.g. a numeric value or a timestamp.

   o  Enumeration.  With data from a well-ordered set, replace the first
      data item data using a random initial value and then allocate
      ordered values for subsequent data items.  When used with
      timestamp data, this preserves ordering but loses precision and
      distance.

   o  Reordering/shuffling.  Preserving the original data, but
      rearranging its order, often in a random manner.

   o  Random substitution.  As replacement, but using randomly generated
      replacement values.

   o  Cryptographic permutation.  Using a permutation function, such as
      a hash function or cryptographic block cipher, to generate a
      replacement de-identified value.

B.1.  Google Analytics non-prefix filtering

   Since May 2010, Google Analytics has provided a facility [10] that
   allows website owners to request that all their users IP addresses
   are anonymized within Google Analytics processing.  This very basic
   anonymization simply sets to zero the least significant 8 bits of
   IPv4 addresses, and the least significant 80 bits of IPv6 addresses.
   The level of anonymization this produces is perhaps questionable.
   There are some analysis results [11] which suggest that the impact of
   this on reducing the accuracy of determining the user's location from
   their IP address is less than might be hoped; the average discrepancy
   in identification of the user city for UK users is no more than 17%.

   Anonymization: Format-preserving, Filtering (grey marking).

B.2.  dnswasher

   Since 2006, PowerDNS have included a de-identification tool dnswasher
   [12] with their PowerDNS product.  This is a PCAP filter that
   performs a one-to-one mapping of end user IP addresses with an
   anonymized address.  A table of user IP addresses and their de-
   identified counterparts is kept; the first IPv4 user addresses is
   translated to 0.0.0.1, the second to 0.0.0.2 and so on.  The de-
   identified address therefore depends on the order that addresses
   arrive in the input, and running over a large amount of data the
   address translation tables can grow to a significant size.

   Anonymization: Format-preserving, Enumeration.

B.3.  Prefix-preserving map

   Used in TCPdpriv [13], this algorithm stores a set of original and
   anonymised IP address pairs.  When a new IP address arrives, it is
   compared with previous addresses to determine the longest prefix
   match.  The new address is anonymized by using the same prefix, with
   the remainder of the address anonymized with a random value.  The use
   of a random value means that TCPdrpiv is not deterministic; different
   anonymized values will be generated on each run.  The need to store
   previous addresses means that TCPdpriv has significant and unbounded
   memory requirements, and because of the need to allocated anonymized
   addresses sequentially cannot be used in parallel processing.

   Anonymization: Format-preserving, prefix preservation (general).

B.4.  Cryptographic Prefix-Preserving Pseudonymisation

   Cryptographic prefix-preserving pseudonymisation was originally
   proposed as an improvement to the prefix-preserving map implemented
   in TCPdpriv, described in Xu et al. [14] and implemented in the
   Crypto-PAn tool [15].  Crypto-PAn is now frequently used as an
   acronym for the algorithm.  Initially it was described for IPv4
   addresses only; extension for IPv6 addresses was proposed in Harvan &
   Schoenwaelder [16] and implemented in snmpdump.  This uses a
   cryptographic algorithm rather than a random value, and thus
   pseudonymity is determined uniquely by the encryption key, and is
   deterministic.  It requires a separate AES encryption for each output
   bit, so has a non-trivial calculation overhead.  This can be
   mitigated to some extent (for IPv4, at least) by pre-calculating
   results for some number of prefix bits.

   Pseudonymization: Format-preserving, prefix preservation (general).

B.5.  Top-hash Subtree-replicated Anonymisation

   Proposed in Ramaswamy & Wolf, Top-hash Subtree-replicated
   Anonymisation (TSA) originated in response to the requirement for
   faster processing than Crypto-PAn.  It used hashing for the most
   significant byte of an IPv4 address, and a pre-calculated binary tree
   structure for the remainder of the address.  To save memory space,
   replication is used within the tree structure, reducing the size of
   the pre-calculated structures to a few Mb for IPv4 addresses.
   Address pseudonymization is done via hash and table lookup, and so
   requires minimal computation.  However, due to the much increased
   address space for IPv6, TSA is not memory efficient for IPv6.

   Pseudonymization: Format-preserving, prefix preservation (general).

B.6.  ipcipher

   A recently-released proposal from PowerDNS [17], ipcipher [18] is a
   simple pseudonymization technique for IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.  IPv6
   addresses are encrypted directly with AES-128 using a key (which may
   be derived from a passphrase).  IPv4 addresses are similarly
   encrypted, but using a recently proposed encryption ipcrypt [19]
   suitable for 32bit block lengths.  However, the author of ipcrypt has
   since indicated [20] that it has low security, and further analysis
   has revealed it is vulnerable to attack.

   Pseudonymization: Format-preserving, cryptographic permutation.

B.7.  Bloom filters

   van Rijswijk-Deij et al. [21] have recently described work using
   Bloom filters to categorize query traffic and record the traffic as
   the state of multiple filters.  The goal of this work is to allow
   operators to identify so-called Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
   originating from specific subnets without storing information about,
   or be able to monitor the DNS queries of an individual user.  By
   using a Bloom filter, it is possible to determine with a high
   probability if, for example, a particular query was made, but the set
   of queries made cannot be recovered from the filter.  Similarly, by
   mixing queries from a sufficient number of users in a single filter,
   it becomes practically impossible to determine if a particular user
   performed a particular query.  Large numbers of queries can be
   tracked in a memory-efficient way.  As filter status is stored, this
   approach cannot be used to regenerate traffic, and so cannot be used
   with tools used to process live traffic.

   Anonymized: Generalization.
