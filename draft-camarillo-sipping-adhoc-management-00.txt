Abstract

   This document defines two mechanisms to manage ad-hoc URI lists in
   SIP. In the first mechanism, the user agent sends an updated version
   of the entire list to the server. In the second mechanism, the server
   provides the user agent with a URI (e.g., http) that can be used to
   manipulate the list using an out-of-band mechanim (e.g., XCAP). We
   define the Associated-List-Manipulation header field that carries a
   URI that allows manipulating an ad-hoc list.

Internet-Draft         Ad-Hoc URI List Management          February 2004


1. Introduction

   SIP messages can carry URI lists using the "list" SIP and SIPS URI
   parameter defined in [3]. An application server receiving a SIP
   request with a URI list creates a so called ad-hoc URI list, which is
   valid for the duration of the service provided by the server.

   Once an ad-hoc URI list is created at the server, the user agent may
   need to manipulate it (e.g., add URIs to the list and remove URIs
   from the list). Section 3 and Section 4 describe two methods to
   perform ad-hoc URI list management.

2. Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
   RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as
   described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [1] and indicate requirement levels for
   compliant implementations.

3. List Substitution

   A user agent MAY provide an application server with an updated
   version of the ad-hoc list by sending a request with a "list"
   parameter [3] in its Request-URI. The "list" parameter MUST contain a
   pointer to the updated list. (The method of this request depends on
   the service being delivered.) On reception of such a request, the
   application server MUST substitute the previous ad-hoc list with the
   list referenced by the "list" parameter.

4. Out-of-Band Management

   Section 3 describes how to send a complete URI list to an application
   server that substitutes the previous one. Following this approach, a
   user agent that wants to modify a single URI in a long URI list needs
   to resend the whole list.

   Still, there are URI list management mechanisms, such as the XCAP
   usage defined in [2], that allow user agents to manipulate URI lists
   more efficiently. We define a new SIP header field called
   Associated-List-Manipulation that allows a server to provide a URI to
   the client to manipulate the ad-hoc list using an out-of-band
   mechanism. The XCAP Usage for Resource Lists MUST be supported. Other
   mechanisms MAY be supported.

   The ABNF of the Associated-List-Manipulation header field is:

5. Examples

   This section shows how to use the mechanisms described in Section 3
   and Section 4 to manipulate the list of participants in an ad-hoc
   conference. This example illustrates the use of both mechanisms. It
   does not mandate how ad-hoc conference services have to be
   implemented.

   When the ad-hoc conferencing server in this example receives an
   initial INVITE with a URI list, it sends out an INVITE to each URI in
   the list and creates an ad-hoc conference with all of them. If, at a
   later point, a URI is added to the list, the conference server
   INVITEs the new user. If a URI is removed from the list, the
   conference server BYEs the user.

   Carol creates an ad-hoc conference on the server by sending the
   INVITE request shown in Figure 1. The list parameter in the
   Request-URI points to a MIME body that carries the list of
   participants.

                      Figure 2: 200 (OK) response

   The conference server responds with the 200 (OK) in Figure 1, which
   carries the URI for the conference in its Contact header field and a
   URI for manipulating the URI list in its Associated-List-Manipulation
   header field.

5.1 List Substitution

   Carol wants to remove Bill and Joe from the conference. She sends the
   re-INVITE in Figure 3 to the conference server with an updated URI
   list in a "list" parameter.

5.2 Out-of-Band Management

   Now, Carol wants to add Alice to the conference. This time, she uses
   the http URI received in the Associated-List-Manipulation header
   field. She uses XCAP to add Alice's URI, so no SIP traffic is
   exchanged between her and the server.

6. Security Considerations

   TBD.

7. IANA Considerations

   This document registers the Associated-List-Manipulation SIP header
   field, which is described in Section 4. This header field is to be
   added to the header field registry under http://www.iana.org/
   assignments/sip-parameters.

      Header Name: Associated-List-Manipulation

      Compact Form: (none)
