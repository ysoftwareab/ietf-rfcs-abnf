              draft-li-ldr-bgp-request-cp-sr-te-policy-00

Abstract

   An SR Policy is a set of candidate paths.  The headend of an SR
   Policy may learn multiple candidate paths for an SR Policy via a
   number of different mechanisms, e.g., CLI, NetConf, PCEP, or BGP.
   BGP distribute candidate paths has been defined in
   [I-D.ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy].  This document defines an
   extension of BGP to request BGP speaker(controller) advertise the
   candidate paths.  The goal is to unify the protocol when the
   candidate path of SR Policy provision is via BGP to reduce the
   network complexity and potential bugs cause by different protocol
   interactions.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.  Introduction

   An SR Policy defined in [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy] is a
   set of candidate paths.  The headend of an SR Policy may be informed
   by various means including: Configuration, PCEP[RFC8281] or
   BGP[I-D.ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy] . All these mechanisms
   are PCE/Controller initiated, but in some situations headend maybe
   want pull one or a set of candidate paths from PCE/Controller rather
   than get all information passively.  Actually PCEP can use request
   and reply messages defined in [RFC5440]to match this requirement but
   the mechanism is not clear when controller advertise candidate path
   via BGP protocol.

   This document wants to define a way to request controller(BGP
   speaker) advertise candidate path via BGP update message to let BGP
   protocol can also get the similar mechanism with request and reply
   like PCEP.

3.  Overview of BGP UPDATE Message for Request SR TE policy candidate
    path advertising

   [I-D.ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy] defined the headend get
   candidate paths by BGP from controller(BGP speaker).  In some
   situations headend just want get these candidate paths when some
   special event occur (e.g receive a customer route (VPN route) with
   special color or special BGP attribute).  This document define the
   mechanism when this special situation occurred how the headend
   request controller to advertise the matched SR policy with the
   candidate paths.

   Step1.  The headend decide to get a new candidate path from
   controller based on some trigger event.  This trigger mechanism is
   out of scope of this document.

Internet-Draft         BGP Trigger SR TE Policies              July 2019


   Step2.  The headend create a new BGP request UPDATE message (defined
   in this document) with constrains of TE, such as affinity, metric,
   SRLG, and so on.  This special request UPDATE message SHOULD NOT be
   used for BGP best path selection.

   Step3.  The controller will calculate one or a set of segment list
   based on the payload of BGP request message from headend.  How to
   calculate the path is out of scope of this document.

   Step4.  The controller advertise SR Policy with candidate path to
   headend.  How to advertise the policy is out of scope of this
   document and defined in [I-D.ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy]

4.  BGP request UPDATE Message Encoding

4.1.  Extention of SR Policy NLRI

   defined the SR Policy NLRI as follows:

    +------------------+
    |   NLRI Length    | 1 octet
    +------------------+
    |  Distinguisher   | 4 octets
    +------------------+
    |   Policy Color   | 4 octets
    +------------------+
    |    Endpoint      | 4 or 16 octets
    +------------------+

   where:

   o  NLRI Length: 1 octet of length expressed in bits as defined in
      [RFC4760].

   o  Distinguisher: 4-octet value uniquely identifying the policy in
      the context of <color, endpoint> tuple.  The distinguisher has no
      semantic value and is solely used by the SR Policy originator to
      make unique (from an NLRI perspective) multiple occurrences of the
      same SR Policy.

   o  Policy Color: 4-octet value identifying (with the endpoint) the
      policy.  The color is used to match the color of the destination
      prefixes to steer traffic into the SR Policy
      [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy]

   o  Endpoint: identifies the endpoint of a policy.  The Endpoint may
      represent a single node or a set of nodes (e.g., an anycast

      address).  The Endpoint is an IPv4 (4-octet) address or an IPv6
      (16-octet) address according to the AFI of the NLRI.

   NLRI Length, Policy Color, Endpoint field remains unchanged, while
   the Distinguisher field will be set to FF:FF:FF:FF to signal the
   request to controller.

4.2.  New SR Policy and Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute

   The content of the SR Policy is encoded in the Tunnel Encapsulation
   Attribute originally defined in [I-D.ietf-idr-tunnel-encaps] using a
   new Tunnel-Type TLV (codepoint is 15, assigned by IANA.  The SR
   Policy Encoding structure is as follows:

   SR Policy SAFI NLRI: <Distinguisher, Policy-Color, Endpoint>
   Attributes:
      Tunnel Encaps Attribute (23)
         Tunnel Type: SR Policy
           <Sub-TLVs>

   Preference, Binding SID, Priority, Policy Name, ENLP, Segment- List,
   Weight and Segment sub-TLVs are all defined in
   [I-D.ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy] for SR Policy advertise to
   headend.

   Additional 6 new Sub-TLVs are defined in this document section 3.3
   for request mechanism.

   1.  LSPA Sub-TLV

   2.  SVEC Sub-TLV

   3.  Metric Sub-TLV

   The LSPA Sub-TLV is optional and specifies various TE LSP attributes
   to be taken for path computation.  Most of the fields of the LSPA
   Sub-TLV are identical to the fields of the SESSION-ATTRIBUTE object

      as subobjects defined in[RFC3209]

   where:

   o  Type: TBD2

   o  Length: the total length (not including the Type and Length
      fields) of the sub-TLVs encoded

   o  Flags (24 bits): Defines the potential dependency between a set of
      segment lists in one candidate path.

   o

      *  L (Link diverse) bit: when set, this indicates that the
         computed segment lists of the same candidate path MUST NOT have
         any link in common.

      *  N (Node diverse) bit: when set, this indicates that the
         computed segment lists of the same candidate path MUST NOT have
         any node in common.

      *  S (SRLG diverse) bit: when set, this indicates that the
         computed segment lists of the same candidate path MUST NOT
         share any SRLG (Shared Risk Link Group).

   In case of a set of segment lists synchronized independent path
   computation, the bits L, N, and S are cleared.

   Unassigned flags MUST be set to zero on transmission and MUST be
   ignored on receipt.

      *  B (Bound - 1 bit): When set in a BGP UPDATE message, the
         metric- value indicates a bound (a maximum) for the path metric
         that must not be exceeded for the headend to consider the
         computed path as acceptable.  The path metric must be less than
         or equal to the value specified in the metric-value field.
         When the B flag is cleared, the metric-value field is not used
         to reflect a bound constraint.

      *  C (Computed Metric - 1 bit): When set in a BGP UPDATE message,
         this indicates that the controller MUST provide the computed
         path metric value (should a path satisfying the constraints be
         found) in the advertise message for the corresponding metric.

      *  Unassigned flags MUST be set to zero on transmission and MUST
         be ignored on receipt.
