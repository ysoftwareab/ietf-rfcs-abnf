1.  Introduction

   BGP [RFC4271] has been extended for the advertisement of different
   kinds of information for various network services, some of which may
   involve the exchange and synchronization of hundreds of thousands of
   BGP routes.  The time of BGP convergence can impact the availability
   of some critical services, or the service of some high priority
   customers.

   For example, for Layer-3 Virtual Private Network (L3VPN) [RFC4364]
   service, there can be more than thousands of VPN customers.  Ideally
   the route convergence of VPN customers should be independent of each
   other.  However, with existing BGP mechanism, the convergence of all
   the customers' VPN routes is treated as a whole, which is not optimal
   and may slow down the route convergence of particular VPN customers.

   BGP Graceful Restart (GR) [RFC4724] defines an End-of-RIB marker
   which can be used to indicate to BGP peers the completion of route
   update for specific address family.  Such End-of-RIB marker is sent
   to BGP peers only when all the routes of specific address family has
   been advertised.  Before this End-of-RIB is received from BGP peers,
   there is no way to know whether the update for a particular VPN
   customer has completed, consequently this would delay the route
   selection and further processing for that customer.  In other word,
   BGP route selection for any VPN customer has to be suspended until
   the End-of-RIB marker for the corresponding address family is
   received from BGP peers.

   Besides, update of the RT membership information with BGP RT-
   Constrain mechanism [RFC4684] may trigger the advertisement of a set
   of BGP routes which contain particular Route Targets (RT).  It would
   be beneficial for BGP speakers to know when the consequent routing
   update is completed.

   This document specifies an enhanced BGP End-of-RIB marker which can
   facilitate fine granular BGP route convergence in various BGP based
   network services.  A new BGP capability to negotiate the usage of the
   enhanced End-of-RIB marker is also specified.

2.  Enhanced End-of-RIB Marker

   The Enhanced End-of-RIB marker is similar to the End-of-RIB marker as
   defined in [RFC4724], which is an UPDATE message with no reachable
   Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) and empty withdrawn
   NLRI.  In addition, the Enhanced End-of-RIB marker also contains a
   set of BGP Path Attributes which are used to identify a particular
   group of BGP routes for which the advertisement has completed.

   The Enhanced End-of-RIB marker can be used to indicate the completion
   of routing update for specific route groups.  One typical example of
   the group is routes of a specific VPN customer, which is identified
   by the RTs of the VPN.

3.  BGP Enhanced End-of-RIB Capability

   A new BGP capability called 'Enhanced End-of-RIB' Capability is
   defined.  The Capability code for this capability is to be assigned.
   The Capability length field is zero.

   By advertising this capability to a peer, a BGP speaker conveys to
   the peer that the speaker support advertising and receiving the
   Enhanced End-of-RIB marker and the related procedures described in
   this document.  After capability negotiation, if both the peer
   speaker and local speaker support this capability, the Enhanced End-
   of-RIB can be used to facilitate fine granular route convergence.

4.  Usage of Enhanced End-of-RIB Marker

   As an enhancement to the existing End-of-RIB marker [RFC4724], the
   advertisement of Enhanced End-of-RIB marker can be used for fine
   granular route convergence of specific route groups within a specific
   address family.  One typical scenario is to use the Enhanced End-of-
   RIB marker as the indication of routing update completion of specific
   VPN customer.  In such case, the Enhanced End-of-RIB marker SHOULD
   carry the Extended Communities attribute which contains the RTs of
   the VPN.  There are also other use cases of fine granular BGP route

   convergence, which is for further study and not included in current
   version of this document.

   The Enhanced End-of-RIB marker may be used only for a subset of VPN
   customers which require faster route convergence, selection of such
   VPN customers is based on the operator's policy.  When the route
   advertisement for such VPN customers is completed, the sending BGP
   speaker MUST send the Enhanced End-of-RIB marker with RTs identifying
   the VPN customers to the peer.  The receiving BGP speaker SHOULD use
   the Enhanced End-of-RIB marker as the trigger of route selection and
   further processing of routes of the identified VPN customers.

   The Enhanced End-of-RIB can be used for both the initial routing
   update and the routing updates triggered by the update of RT
   membership information [RFC4684], while the traditional End-of-RIB
   marker SHOULD still be used to indicate the completion of routing
   updates for the whole address family.

5.  IANA Considerations

   A new BGP capability - Enhanced End-of-RIB Capability is defined in
   this document.  The Capability code needs to be assigned by the IANA.

6.  Security Considerations

   Procedures and protocol extensions defined in this document do not
   affect the BGP security model.  See [RFC6952] for details.
