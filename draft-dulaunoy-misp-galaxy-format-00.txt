Abstract

   This document describes the MISP galaxy format which describes a
   simple JSON format to represent galaxies and clusters that can be
   attached to MISP events or attributes.  A public directory of MISP
   galaxies is available and relies on the MISP galaxy format.  MISP
   galaxies are used to add further informations on a MISP event.MISP
   galaxy is a public repository [MISP-G] of known malware, threats
   actors and various other collections of data that can be used to
   mark, classify or label data in threat information sharing.

1.  Introduction

   Sharing threat information became a fundamental requirements on the
   Internet, security and intelligence community at large.  Threat
   information can include indicators of compromise, malicious file
   indicators, financial fraud indicators or even detailed information
   about a threat actor.  Some of these informations, such as malware or
   threat actors are common to several security events.  MISP galaxy is
   a public repository [MISP-G] of known malware, threats actors and
   various other collections of data that can be used to mark, classify
   or label data in threat information sharing.

   In the MISP galaxy context, clusters help analysts to give more
   informations about their cybersecurity events, indicators or threats.
   MISP galaxies can be used for classification, filtering, triggering
   actions or visualisation depending on their use in threat
   intelligence platforms such as MISP [MISP-P].

1.1.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Format

   A cluster is composed of a value (MUST), a description (OPTIONAL) and
   metadata (OPTIONAL).

Internet-Draft             MISP galaxy format             September 2017


   Clusters are represented as a JSON [RFC4627] dictionary.

2.1.  Overview

   The MISP galaxy format uses the JSON [RFC4627] format.  Each galaxy
   is represented as a JSON object with meta information including the
   following fields: name, uuid, description, version, type, authors,
   source, values.

   name defines the name of the galaxy.  The name is represented as a
   string and MUST be present.  The uuid represents the Universally
   Unique IDentifier (UUID) [RFC4122] of the object reference.  The uuid
   MUST be preserved.  For any updates or transfer of the same object
   reference.  UUID version 4 is RECOMMENDED when assigning it to a new
   object reference and MUST be present.  The description is represented
   as a string and MUST be present.  The uuid is represented as a string
   and MUST be present.  The version is represented as a decimal and
   MUST be present.  The source is represented as a string and MUST be
   present.  Authors are represented as an array containing one or more
   author and MUST be present.

   Values are represented as an array containing one or more value and
   MUST be present.  Values defines all values available in the galaxy.

2.2.  values

   The values array contains one or more JSON objects which represents
   all the possible values in the galaxy.  The JSON object contains
   three fields: value description and meta.  The value is represented
   as a string and MUST be present.  The description is represented as a
   string and SHOULD be present.  The meta or metadata is represented as
   a JSON list and SHOULD be present.

2.3.  meta

   Meta contains a list of custom defined JSON key value pairs.  Users
   SHOULD reuse commonly used keys such as 'properties, complexity,
   effectiveness, country, possible_issues, colour, motive, impact,
   refs, synonyms, derivated_from, status, date, encryption, extensions,
   ransomnotes' wherever applicable.

   properties is used to provide clusters with additional properties.
   Properties are represented as an array containing one or more strings
   ans MAY be present.

   complexity, effectiveness, impact, possible_issues MAY be used to
   give further information in preventive-measure galaxy. complexity is
   represented by an enumerated value from a fixed vocabulary and SHALL

   be present. effectiveness is represented by an enumerated value from
   a fixed vocabulary and SHALL be present. impact is represented by an
   enumerated value from a fixed vocabulary and SHALL be present.
   possible_issues is represented as a string and SHOULD be present.

   country, motive MAY be used to give further information in threat-
   actor galaxy. country is represented as a string and SHOULD be
   present. motive is represented as a string and SHOULD be present.

   colour fields MAY be used at predicates or values level to set a
   specify colour that MAY be used by the implementation.  The colour
   field is described as an RGB colour fill in hexadecimal
   representation.

   encryption, extensions, ransomnotes MAY be used to give further
   information in ransomware galaxy. encryption is represented as a
   string and SHALL be present. extensions is represented as an array
   containing one or more strings and SHALL be present. ransomnotes is
   represented as an array containing one or more strings ans SHALL be
   present.

   date, status MAY be used to give time information about an cluster.
   date is represented as a string decribing a time or period and SHALL
   be present. status is represented as a string describing the current
   status of the clusters.  It MAY also describe a time or period and
   SHALL be present.

   derivated_from, refs, synonyms SHALL be used to give further
   informations. refs is represented as an containing one or ore string
   and SHALL be present. synonyms is represented as an containing one or
   ore string and SHALL be present. derivated_from is represented as an
   containing one or ore string and SHALL be present.
