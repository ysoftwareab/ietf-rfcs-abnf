<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) has been designed
            as a general purpose protocol for establishing and
            managing multimedia sessions. It provides many core
            functions and extensions in support of features such as
            transferring of calls, parking calls, and so on. However,
            interoperability of more advanced features between
            different vendors has been poor. This document describes
            the reason behind these interoperability problems, and
            presents a framework for addressing them.

Introduction</h3>

<p>
The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) <a class='info' href='#RFC3261'>[RFC3261]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., Schulzrinne, H., Camarillo, G., Johnston, A., Peterson, J., Sparks, R., Handley, M., and E. Schooler, &ldquo;SIP: Session Initiation Protocol,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> has
been designed as a general purpose protocol for establishing and
managing multimedia sessions. In this role, it provides many core
functions and extensions to support "session management features". In
this context, session management features (or just features in this
specification) are operations, typically invoked by the user, that
provide some form value-added functionality within the context of a
multimedia session. Examples of features include putting a call on
hold (possibly with music), transferring calls, creating ad-hoc
conferences, having calls automatically forwarded, and so on.

</p>
<p>
The SIP specification itself includes primitives to support some of
these features. For example, RFC 3264 <a class='info' href='#RFC3264'>[RFC3264]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J. and H. Schulzrinne, &ldquo;An Offer/Answer Model with Session Description Protocol (SDP),&rdquo; June&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> defines
SDP signaling parameters for placing a call on hold. Numerous SIP
extensions have been developed which focus on functionality needed for
session management features. The REFER specification, RFC 3515
<a class='info' href='#RFC3515'>[RFC3515]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Sparks, R., &ldquo;The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Refer Method,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a>, defines a primitive operation for a user
agent to ask another user agent to send a SIP request, typically to
initiate a session. REFER is used to support many features, such as
transfer, park, and refer. The Replaces specification, RFC 3891
<a class='info' href='#RFC3891'>[RFC3891]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Mahy, R., Biggs, B., and R. Dean, &ldquo;The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) &quot;Replaces&quot; Header,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>, allows one dialog to replace another. This
header field is useful for consultation transfer features. The dialog
event package, RFC 4235 <a class='info' href='#RFC4235'>[RFC4235]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., Schulzrinne, H., and R. Mahy, &ldquo;An INVITE-Initiated Dialog Event Package for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP),&rdquo; November&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>, allows one UA to
learn about the dialog states on another UA. This package is useful
for features such as shared line.

</p>
<p>
However, despite this veritable plethora of specifications that can
support session management features, in practice, interoperability has
been quite poor for these kinds of functions. One user agents from one
vendor are connected to servers and user agents from other vendors,
very few of these types of features actually work. In most cases, call
hold and basic transfer are broadly interoperable, but more advanced
features such as park and resume, music-on-hold, and shared line
appearances, do not work.

</p>
<p>
In some cases, these interoperability failures are the fault of poor
implementations. In other cases, they are purposeful failures, meant
to ensure that third party equipment is not utilized in a vendor's
solution. However, in many cases the problem is with the
specifications. There are two primary specification problems that can
cause interoperability failure:
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>A feature requires functionality that is not defined in any
  specification. Therefore, the feature cannot be implemented in an
  interoperable way.

</li>
<li>A feature can be implemented in many different ways, each one using
  different specifications or different call flows, and assuming
  different functionality in each participating component of the
  system. However, each component in a particular deployment
  each chose a different way, and therefore the overall system lacks
  interoperability. 

</li>
</ul><p>

</p>
<p>
This latter problem is the primary focus of this
document. <a class='info' href='#sec-tongues'>Section&nbsp;2<span> (</span><span class='info'>The Confusion of Tongues</span><span>)</span></a> describes the problem in
architectural and more abstract 
terms. <a class='info' href='#sec-ex'>Section&nbsp;3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Concrete Examples</span><span>)</span></a> then gives several concrete examples that
demonstrate the problem. <a class='info' href='#sec-consider'>Section&nbsp;4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Solution Considerations</span><span>)</span></a> then proposes a general framework for resolving
the interoperability problem. Finally, <a class='info' href='#sec-template'>Section&nbsp;6<span> (</span><span class='info'>Structure of the BLISS Final 				      Deliverable</span><span>)</span></a>
defines a template 
that can be utilized by specifications for addressing this
interoperability problem.

<a name="rfc.section.2"></a><h3>2.&nbsp;
The Confusion of Tongues</h3>

<p>
SIP is typically deployed in environments a large number of user
agents and some number of servers, such as proxy servers, registrars,
feature servers, and so on. Put together, these form a distributed
system used to realize a multimedia communications network. 

</p>
<p>
Architecturally, a SIP-based multimedia network can be though of as a
distributed state machine. Each node in the network implements a state
machine, and messages sent by the protocol serve the purpose of
synchronizing the state machines across nodes. If one considers these
session management features (hold, transfer, park, etc.), each of them
is ultimately trying to achieve a change in states in the state
machines of two or more nodes in the network. Call hold, for example,
attempts to change the state of media transfer between a pair of user
agents. More complex features, such as transfer, are an attempt to
synchronize dialog and call states across three or more user
agents. In all cases, SIP messaging is used between these agents to
change the state machinery of the protocol.

</p>
<p>
If we consider a particular feature, the protocol machinery for
accomplishing the feature requires logic on each node involved in the
feature. Let us say that feature X can be implemented using two
different techniques - X.1 and X.2. Each technique is composed of a
series of message exchanges and associated state machine processing in
each affected node. If all affected nodes implement the same logic -
say the logic for X.1 - the feature works. Similarly, if all implement
the logic for X.2, the feature works. However, if some of the nodes
implement the logic for X.1, and others have implemented the logic for
X.2, the outcome is unpredicable and the feature may not
interoperate. 

</p>
<p>
We call this problem "the confusion of tongues". It arises whenever
there is more than one way to implement a particular feature amongst a
set of nodes. While each approach is, by itself, conformant to the
specifications, there are interoperability failures because of a
heterogeneous selection of methodologies within a particular
deployment.

Concrete Examples</h3>

<p>
Several concrete examples can be demonstrated which show this
problem.

<a name="rfc.section.3.1"></a><h3>3.1.&nbsp;
Call Forward No Answer</h3>

<p>
Call Forward No Answer (CFNA), is a very basic feature. In this
feature, user X calls user Y. If user Y is not answering, the
call is forwarded to another user, user Z. Typically this forwarding
takes place after a certain amount of time.

</p>
<p>
Even for a simple feature like this, there are several ways of
implementing it. Consider the reference architecture in
<a class='info' href='#fig-cfna-ref-arch'>Figure&nbsp;1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Call Forward Use Case</span><span>)</span></a>.

In this simple network, there are four "nodes" that are cooperating to
implement this feature. There are three user agents, UA X, UA Y and UA
Z. All three user agents are associated with a single proxy. When UA X
makes a call to UA Y, the INVITE is sent to the proxy which delivers
it to UA Y.

In this approach, the call forwarding functionality is implemented in
the user agents. The user agents have a field on the user interface
that a user can enable to cause calls to be forwarded on
no-answer. The user can also set up the forward-to URI through the
user interface.

When the call from UA X arrives at the proxy, it is forwarded to UA
Y. User Y is not there, so UA Y rings for a time. After the call
forward timeout has elapsed, UA Y generates a 302 response. This
response contains a Contact header field containing the forward-to
URI (sip:Z@example.com). This is received by the proxy, which recurses
on the 3xx, causing the call to be forwarded to Z.

When the call from UA X arives at the proxy, the proxy sends the
INVITE to UA Y. UA Y rings for a time. The call timeout timer runs on
the proxy. After the timeout has elapsed, the proxy generates a
CANCEL, causing the call to stop ringing at UA X. It then consults its
internal configuration, notes that call forwarding on no-answer is
configured for user Y. It obtains the forward-to URI, and sends an
INVITE to it. User Z ansers and the call proceeds.

UA X sends an INVITE to its proxy targeted for Y. The proxy sends this
INVITE to UA Y. The user does not answer. So, after a timeout, the UA
acts like a proxy and sends the INVITE back to P, this time with a
Request-URI identifying Z. The proxy forwards this to Z, and the call
completes.

Failure Cases</h3>

<p>
We have now described four different call forwarding
implementations. All four are compliant to RFC 3261. All four assume
some form of "feature logic" in some of the components in order to
realize this feature. For Approach I, this logic is entirely in the
UA, and consists of the activation of the feature, configuration of
the forward-to URI, execution of the timer, and then causing of a
redirect to the forward-to URI. In approach I, no other logic beyond
RFC 3261 compliance is needed. For approach II, the logic is entirely
in the proxy, and consists of the activation of the feature through
the web, configuration of the forward-to URI through the web,
execution of the timer, and then causing of CANCEL and sequential fork
to the forward-to URI. In approach II, no other "feature logic" is
required on any other component. In approach III, all of the logic
exists on the UA, and consists of the activation of the feature,
configuration of the forward-to URI, execution of the timer, and then
causing of a proxy to the forward-to URI. In approach IV, all of the
feature logic is in the proxy, but it is implemented by CPL, and the
UA has a CPL implementation that establishes the forwarding number
configuration. 

</p>
<p>
If one considers several different combinations of implementation,
several error cases arise.

In this case, the UA assumes approach II (that is, it assumes the
proxy handles call forwarding), while the proxy assumes approaches I
or III (that is, the UA handles call forwarding). In this case, the
call will arrive at the proxy, which forwards it to UA Y, where it
rings indefinitely. The feature does not get provided at all.

In this case, the UA assumes approach I (that is, it assumes that it
handles call forwarding), and the proxy assumes approach II (that it,
it assumes that it handles call forwarding). In this case, assuming
that the forwarding number ends up being provisioned in both places,
the actual behavior of the system is a race condition. If the timer
fires first at the proxy, the call is forwarded to the number
configured on the proxy. If the timer fires first on the UA, the call
is forwarded to the number configured on the UA. If these forwarding
numbers are different, this results in highly confusing behavior.

Solution Considerations</h3>

<p>
There are many ways this interoperability problem can be solved. The
most obvious solution is to actually enumerate every specific feature
that we wish to support with SIP (Call Forward No Answer, Call Forward
Busy, Hold, Music-on-hold, and so on). Then, for each feature,
identify a specific call flow that realizes it, and describe the exact
functionality required in each component of the system. In the case of
call forward no answer, for example, we would choose one of the four
approaches, define the information that needs to be configured
(timeout, activation state, call forwarding URI), and describe the timer
and how it operates. This approach would actually lead to excellent
interoperability, but would come at high cost. The set of
interoperable features would be limited to only those which we
explicitly specify, and there would be little room for innovation.

</p>
<p>
To avoid this pitfall and others like it, a proper solution to the
interoperability has to be structured in such a way that it achieves
the following goals:

</p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Avoid Enumeration:</dt>
<dd> One of the main goals of SIP is to
  provide a rich set of features. If it requires a specification to be
  developed for each and every feature, this goal of SIP is
  lost. Instead, SIP will be limited to a small number of features and
  it will be hard to add new ones. Therefore, any solution to the
  interoperability problem must avoid the need to enumerate each and
  every feature and document something about it.

</dd>
<dt>Allow Variability in Definition:</dt>
<dd> It should not be necessary to
  rigorously define the behavior of any particular feature. It is
  possible for variations to occur that do not affect
  interoperability. For example, a variation on CFNA is that a
  provisional response can be sent back to the originator informing
  them that the call was forwarded. This variation can be implemented
  without impacting interoperability at all; if the originator can
  render or utilize the provisional response, things work. If they
  can't things still work on the originator simply doesn't get that
  part of the feature. We should allow this kind of localized
  variability in what each feature does, to preserve innovation.

</dd>
<dt>Assume Multimedia:</dt>
<dd> Though many of the features
  discussed so far are very telephony centric, they all apply and can
  be used with any number of media types. In addition, it is important
  that the solution to the interoperability problem not assume a
  particular media type. Unless the feature is specifically about a
  media type (instant message logging for example), it must be
  possible for it to work with all media types.

</dd>
<dt>Allow Variability in Implementation:</dt>
<dd> Whenever possible,
  the solution to the interoperability problem should strive to allow
  variations in how the implementations work, while preserving
  interoperability. For example, in the case of call forwarding, the
  central source of interoperability failure is that is unclear
  whether the UAs or proxies have responsibility for the forwarding
  logic. If the decision was made that this logic is in the UA, then
  either Approach I or Approach III will work. Consequently, it is not
  necessary to specify which of those two approaches is to be
  implemented; just that the UA performs the implementation.

<dd> SIP is utilized

  providers targeted to consumers, enterprises with business phones,
  and peer-to-peer systems where there is no central server at
  all. SIP is utilized in wireless networks with limited bandwidth and
  high packet loss, and in high-bandwidth wired environments. It
  is the goal of this process that interoperability be possible using
  the same set of specifications for all cases. The problem is not
  restricted to just enterprises, even though many advanced features
  typically get associated with enterprise.

BLISS Solution Framework</h3>

The framework for solving this interoperability dilemma is called
BLISS - Basic Level of Interoperability for SIP Services. This
solution is actually a process that a working group can follow to
identify interoperability problems and then develop solutions.

<a name="rfc.section.5.1"></a><h3>5.1.&nbsp;
Phase I - Identify a Feature Group</h3>

<p>
The first step is to identify a set of features which have been known
to be problematic in actual deployments. These features are collected
into bundles called a feature group. A feature group is a collection
of actual features that all have a similar flow, and for which it is
believed the source of interoperability failures may be common. For
example, Call Forward No Answer, Call Forward Busy, Call Forward
Unconditional are all very similar, and clearly all have the same
interoperability problem described in
<a class='info' href='#sec-cfna'>Section&nbsp;3.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Call Forward No Answer</span><span>)</span></a>. However, the root issue with these flows is
that there needs to be a common understanding of where call treatment
feature logic is executed, and how the desired treatment is signaled
from the user to the place where it is implemented. Thus, other
features that are similar, in that they make a decision on call
handling based on user input or conditions, will likely also benefit
from consideration. 

</p>
<p>
Thus, a feature group is defined by a characteristic that identifies a
large (and in fact, possibly infinite) number of actual "features"
that all belong to the group. This characteristic is called its
functional primitive. The first step in the BLISS process is to
identify feature groups and their functional primitives that are
narrow enough so they are meaningful, yet broad enough that they are
not overly constraining. This is not exact, and the initial
definitions do not need to be exact. They can be refined as the BLISS
process proceeds. In the case of CFNA, clearly a functional primitive of
"call forwarding features that execute on no-answer" is too narrow. A
functional primitive of "features that handle an initial
INVITE" is too broad. An ideal starting point would probably be,
"features that result in a retargeting or response operation that
depend on user-specified criteria". This covers all of the call
forwarding variations, but also includes features like Do-Not-Disturb.

</p>
<p>
Each feature group should be defined in a similar way, through the
definition of a functional primitive by which one could decide whether or not a
particular feature was included. As part of this definition, the group
can consider specific features and agree whether or not they are
covered by the primitive. For example, would "send call to voicemail"
be covered by 
the functional primitive "features that result in a retargeting or response
operation that depend on user-specified criteria"? The answer is yes
in this case. Discussion of what features are covered by a functional
primitive is part of the discussion in this phase.

</p>
<p>
Care must be taken not to define the functional primitive in such a
way as to eliminate the possibility of any but a defined and
enumerated set of features from being included. The functional
primitive should clearly cover features which are in existence today,
and of interest, but allow for future ones that could be covered by
the primitive. This avoids the perils of enumeration as discussed in
<a class='info' href='#sec-consider'>Section&nbsp;4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Solution Considerations</span><span>)</span></a>.

<a name="rfc.section.5.2"></a><h3>5.2.&nbsp;
Phase II - Submit Feature Flows</h3>

<p>
With the functional primitive identified and a shared understanding of which
features fit within it, the next step is for working group
participants to document how their implementations implement features
in the group. This takes the form of call flows along with explanatory
text that clearly articulates what kind of logic, specific to that
feature, is assumed in each component of the system. The approaches
for CFNA documented in <a class='info' href='#sec-cfna'>Section&nbsp;3.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Call Forward No Answer</span><span>)</span></a> are exactly what is
required at this stage. Ideally, there would be a document submitted
to the working group for each implementation. For example, "Company
Foo Flows for Call Forward" would be a document submitted by an
employee of company Foo, documenting their flow for call forward. THis
document can include flows for each variation that the implementation
supports. For example, it might have a separate call flow documented
for CFNA, for CFB, and for CFU.

</p>
<p>
Obviously, other documentation procedures are possible. A single
editor can work with a team, and the team all suggest specific flows
that are accumulated into one document. This avoids the need for
vendor-specific documents. Participants can also suggest flows they
think might exist or might work, even if there is no known
implementation of the flow. That is fine too. The primary objective of
this phase is to collect as many flows as possible for features that
are covered by the feature group definition.

</p>
<p>
It is a decision of the working group as to whether to actually
publish these flows as an RFC, or to use the flows as working
documents. The flows themselves are not actually the output of the
BLISS process; they are only an intermediate step. If the flows are to
be published as an RFC, it is suggested that a single document be
published for each functional primitive. The title of the document would be
something like, "Enumeration of Existing Practices for Foo" where
"Foo" is some moniker for the functional primitive. Such a 
document must be clear that it is NOT a best practice. It would
strictly be informational. The document would have subsections for
each flow contributed and considered by the group.

<a name="rfc.section.5.3"></a><h3>5.3.&nbsp;
BLISS Phase III - Problem Definition</h3>

<p>
With flows for a particular feature group collected, the next step in
the process is to an analysis on the flows. The analysis considers
each permutation of implementation of logic from the flows submitted
in the previous phase, and determines which combinations work, and
which ones do not. 

</p>
<p>
General speaking, this analysis is performed by taking the components
associated with the feature (for example, in the case of CFNA, there
are four components - three UA and one proxy), and for each one
considering what happens when it implements one of the logical
behaviors identified in the flow documents from the previous
phase. Thus, if four variations on a feature have been submitted to
the group, and that feature has four components, there are 16 possible
deployment scenarios that can be considered. In practice, many of
these are equivalent or moot, and therefore the number in practice
will be much smaller. The group should work to identify those cases
that are going to be of interest, and then based on the logic in each
component, figure out where interoperability failures occur.

</p>
<p>
This phase can be accomplished using documents that contain flows, or
can be purely a thinking exercise carried out on the mailing list. In
all likelihood, it will depend on the feature group and the level of
complexity. Regardless of the intermediate steps, the end goal of this
phase should be an enumeration of combinations with known
interoperability problems. This output would look exactly like the
contents of <a class='info' href='#sec-failcases'>Section&nbsp;3.1.5<span> (</span><span class='info'>Failure Cases</span><span>)</span></a>, which describe several
failure modes that are possible.

<a name="rfc.section.5.4"></a><h3>5.4.&nbsp;
BLISS Phase 4 - Minimum Interop
				    Definition</h3>

<p>
The final step in the BLISS process is to repair the interopreability
failures identified in the previous phase. This is done by coming up
with a set of recommendations on behaviors of various components, such
that, were those rules to be followed, those interoperability failure
cases would not have occurred.

</p>
<p>
In some cases, these recommendations identify a place in the network
where something has to happen. Again, considering our CFNA example,
the primary recommendation that needs to be made is where the logic
for call handling should happen - in the UA, in the proxy, or
both. This is likely to be a contentious topic, and the right thing
will certainly be a function of participant preference and use cases
that are considered important. But, no one ever said life is easy.

</p>
<p>
In other cases, these recommendations take the form of a specification
that needs to be implemented. For example, CFNA can be implemented
using CPL, in which case both the UA and proxy need to support it. If
the group should decide that CPL is the main way to implement these
features, the recommendation should clearly state that CPL is required
in both places.

</p>
<p>
Indeed, if a particular functional primitive requires any functionality to be
present in any node that goes beyond the "common" functions in RFC
3261, the recommendations need to state that. For example, if a
particular feature can be implemented using S/MIME, and the group
decides that S/MIME is the required everywhere for this feature to
work, that recommendation should be clearly stated. 

</p>
<p>
In some cases, only a part of a specification is required in order for
the features in a feature group to be interoperable. In that case, the
group should identify which parts it is. In the example of CPL, RFC
3880 <a class='info' href='#RFC3880'>[RFC3880]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Lennox, J., Wu, X., and H. Schulzrinne, &ldquo;Call Processing Language (CPL): A Language for User Control of Internet Telephony Services,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>, the ability to support non-signalling
controls is not neccesary to achieve an implementation of this feature
group. So, the recommendation could be that this part is not required.

</p>
<p>
Another key part of the recommendations that get made in this phase,
are recommendations around capability discovery. If a decision is made
that says there are multiple different ways that a feature can work,
and it is necessary to know which one is in use, some kind of
capability exchange is required. Consider once more CFNA. If the
recommendation of the group is that all proxies have to implement
the logic associated with the feature, but phones can also optionally
do it, the UA needs to determine whether it has to be responsible for
this feature or not. Otherwise, the failure mode in
<a class='info' href='#sec-both'>Section&nbsp;3.1.5.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Both Implement</span><span>)</span></a> may still happen. This particular problem
can be resolved, for example, by the use of a feature tag in the
Require header field that would inform the proxy whether it should or
should not provide the feature. The BLISS recommendations for this
phase need to include these kinds of things, if they are necessary for
the feature group.

</p>
<p>
The recommendations in this phase, covering specific protocols or
pieces of protocols, places where functionality needs to reside, and
capability negotiations and controls, are all the final output of the
BLISS process. If the group has done its job well, with these
recommendations, a (potentially large) class of features will
interoperate, yet there will be room for innovation.

Structure of the BLISS Final
				      Deliverable</h3>

<p>
This section describes a recommended template for the final BLISS
deliverable - the recommendations of <a class='info' href='#sec-phase4'>Section&nbsp;5.4<span> (</span><span class='info'>BLISS Phase 4 - Minimum Interop 				    Definition</span><span>)</span></a>.

</p>
<p>
There will typically be a document produced per functional primitive. The
title of the document must clearly articulate the functional primitive
that is being addressed. For example, if the functional group is
forwarding, an appropriate title would be, "Best Practices for
Interoperability of Forwarding Features in the Session Initiation
Protocol". It is important that the feature group be well articulated
in the title, so that implementors seeking guidance on these features
can find it.

</p>
<p>
Similarly, the abstract of the document is very important. It has to
contain several sentences that more clearly articulate the functional
primitive definition. In addition, the abstract should contain example
features, by name or description, that are defined by the functional
primitive. Again, this is important so that people looking to understand
why feature foo doesn't work, can find the right specification that
tells them what they need to do to make it work.

</p>
<p>
The body of the document needs to first clearly and fully define the
functional primitive. It must then enumerate features that
are in the group. Next, the document should summarize the problems
that have arisen in practice that led to the interoperability
failures. This would basically be a summarization of the results of
phase III of the BLISS process. If the feature group were call
forwarding, this part of the document would discuss how the primary
problem is where in the network the actual feature logic lives - UA or
proxy, and that the interop problems occur because of inconsistent
choices between UA and proxy. The final part of the document is
explicit recommendations. This would typically be broken out by
component types - a section for UA, a section for proxies or "servers"
more generally (so that it is clear that B2BUAs aren't excused from
the interoperability requirements). This section would clearly state
the requirements for this feature group - specifications, portions of
specifications, and capability behaviors that are required.
