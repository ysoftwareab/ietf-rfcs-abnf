                      Structured Headers for HTTP
                 draft-ietf-httpbis-header-structure-11

Abstract

   This document describes a set of data types and associated algorithms
   that are intended to make it easier and safer to define and handle
   HTTP header fields.  It is intended for use by specifications of new
   HTTP header fields that wish to use a common syntax that is more
   restrictive than traditional HTTP field values.

1.  Introduction

   Specifying the syntax of new HTTP header fields is an onerous task;
   even with the guidance in [RFC7231], Section 8.3.1, there are many
   decisions - and pitfalls - for a prospective HTTP header field
   author.

   Once a header field is defined, bespoke parsers and serializers often
   need to be written, because each header has slightly different
   handling of what looks like common syntax.

   This document introduces a set of common data structures for use in
   definitions of new HTTP header field values to address these
   problems.  In particular, it defines a generic, abstract model for
   header field values, along with a concrete serialisation for
   expressing that model in textual HTTP [RFC7230] header fields.

   HTTP headers that are defined as "Structured Headers" use the types
   defined in this specification to define their syntax and basic
   handling rules, thereby simplifying both their definition by
   specification writers and handling by implementations.

   Additionally, future versions of HTTP can define alternative
   serialisations of the abstract model of these structures, allowing
   headers that use it to be transmitted more efficiently without being
   redefined.

   Note that it is not a goal of this document to redefine the syntax of
   existing HTTP headers; the mechanisms described herein are only
   intended to be used with headers that explicitly opt into them.

   Section 2 describes how to specify a Structured Header.

   Section 3 defines a number of abstract data types that can be used in
   Structured Headers.  Those abstract types can be serialized into and
   parsed from textual HTTP headers using the algorithms described in
   Section 4.

1.1.  Intentionally Strict Processing

   This specification intentionally defines strict parsing and
   serialisation behaviours using step-by-step algorithms; the only
   error handling defined is to fail the operation altogether.

   It is designed to encourage faithful implementation and therefore
   good interoperability.  Therefore, an implementation that tried to be
   "helpful" by being more tolerant of input would make interoperability
   worse, since that would create pressure on other implementations to
   implement similar (but likely subtly different) workarounds.

   In other words, strict processing is an intentional feature of this
   specification; it allows non-conformant input to be discovered and
   corrected by the producer early, and avoids both interoperability and
   security issues that might otherwise result.

   Note that as a result of this strictness, if a header field is
   appended to by multiple parties (e.g., intermediaries, or different
   components in the sender), an error in one party's value is likely to
   cause the entire header field to fail parsing.

1.2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document uses algorithms to specify parsing and serialisation
   behaviours, and the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation of
   [RFC5234] to illustrate expected syntax in textual HTTP header
   fields.  In doing so, uses the VCHAR, SP, DIGIT, ALPHA and DQUOTE
   rules from [RFC5234].  It also includes the OWS rule from [RFC7230].

   When parsing from textual HTTP header fields, implementations MUST
   follow the algorithms, but MAY vary in implementation so as the
   behaviours are indistinguishable from specified behaviour.  If there
   is disagreement between the parsing algorithms and ABNF, the

Internet-Draft         Structured Headers for HTTP             July 2019


   specified algorithms take precedence.  In some places, the algorithms
   are "greedy" with whitespace, but this should not affect conformance.

   For serialisation to textual header fields, the ABNF illustrates the
   range of acceptable wire representations with as much fidelity as
   possible, and the algorithms define the recommended way to produce
   them.  Implementations MAY vary from the specified behaviour so long
   as the output still matches the ABNF.

2.  Defining New Structured Headers

   To define a HTTP header as a structured header, its specification
   needs to:

   o  Reference this specification.  Recipients and generators of the
      header need to know that the requirements of this document are in
      effect.

   o  Specify the header field's allowed syntax for values, in terms of
      the types described in Section 3, along with their associated
      semantics.  Syntax definitions are encouraged to use the ABNF
      rules beginning with "sh-" defined in this specification.

   o  Specify any additional constraints upon the syntax of the
      structured used, as well as the consequences when those
      constraints are violated.  When Structured Headers parsing fails,
      the header is discarded (see Section 4.2); in most situations,
      header-specific constraints should do likewise.

   Note that a header field definition cannot relax the requirements of
   this specification because doing so would preclude handling by
   generic software; they can only add additional constraints (for
   example, on the numeric range of integers and floats, the format of
   strings and tokens, or the number of items in a list).  Likewise,
   header field definitions should use Structured Headers for the entire
   header field value, not a portion thereof.

   This specification defines minimums for the length or number of
   various structures supported by Structured Headers implementations.
   It does not specify maximum sizes in most cases, but header authors
   should be aware that HTTP implementations do impose various limits on
   the size of individual header fields, the total number of fields,
   and/or the size of the entire header block.

   For example,

Internet-Draft         Structured Headers for HTTP             July 2019


   42. Foo-Example Header

   The Foo-Example HTTP header field conveys information about how
   much Foo the message has.

   Foo-Example is a Structured Header [RFCxxxx]. Its value MUST be a
   dictionary ([RFCxxxx], Section Y.Y). Its ABNF is:

     Foo-Example = sh-dictionary

   The dictionary MUST contain:

   * Exactly one member whose name is "foo", and whose value is an
     integer ([RFCxxxx], Section Y.Y), indicating the number of foos
     in the message.
   * Exactly one member whose name is "barUrl", and whose value is a
     string ([RFCxxxx], Section Y.Y), conveying the Bar URL for the
     message. See below for processing requirements.

   If the parsed header field does not contain both, it MUST be
   ignored.

   "foo" MUST be between 0 and 10, inclusive; other values MUST cause
   the header to be ignored.

   "barUrl" contains a URI-reference ([RFC3986], Section 4.1).

   If barURL is not a valid URI-reference, it MUST be ignored.
   If barURL is a relative reference ([RFC3986], Section 4.2),
   it MUST be resolved ([RFC3986], Section 5) before being used.

3.  Structured Header Data Types

   This section defines the abstract value types that can be composed
   into Structured Headers.  The ABNF provided represents the on-wire
   format in HTTP.

3.1.  Lists

   Lists are arrays of zero or more members, each of which can be an
   item (Section 3.3) or an inner list (an array of zero or more items).

   Each member of the top-level list can also have associated parameters
   - an ordered map of key-value pairs where the keys are short, textual
   strings and the values are items (Section 3.3).  There can be zero or
   more parameters on a member, and their keys are required to be unique
   within that scope.

Internet-Draft         Structured Headers for HTTP             July 2019


   The ABNF for lists is:

   sh-list       = list-member *( OWS "," OWS list-member )
   list-member   = ( sh-item / inner-list ) *parameter
   inner-list    = "(" OWS [ sh-item *( SP sh-item ) OWS ] ")"
   parameter     = OWS ";" OWS param-name [ "=" param-value ]
   param-name    = key
   key           = lcalpha *( lcalpha / DIGIT / "_" / "-" )
   lcalpha       = %x61-7A ; a-z
   param-value   = sh-item

   In textual HTTP headers, each member is separated by a comma and
   optional whitespace.  For example, a header field whose value is
   defined as a list of strings could look like:

   Example-StrListHeader: "foo", "bar", "It was the best of times."

   In textual HTTP headers, inner lists are denoted by surrounding
   parenthesis, and have their values delimited by a single space.  A
   header field whose value is defined as a list of lists of strings
   could look like:

   Example-StrListListHeader: ("foo" "bar"), ("baz"), ("bat" "one"), ()

   Note that the last member in this example is an empty inner list.

   In textual HTTP headers, members' parameters are separated from the
   member and each other by semicolons.  For example:

Example-ParamListHeader: abc_123;a=1;b=2; cdef_456, (ghi jkl);q="9";r="w"

   Parsers MUST support lists containing at least 1024 members, support
   members with at least 256 parameters, support inner-lists containing
   at least 256 members, and support parameter keys with at least 64
   characters.

   Header specifications can constrain the types of individual list
   values (including that of individual inner-list members and
   parameters) if necessary.

3.2.  Dictionaries

   Dictionaries are ordered maps of name-value pairs, where the names
   are short, textual strings and the values are items (Section 3.3) or
   arrays of items.  There can be zero or more members, and their names
   are required to be unique within the scope of the dictionary they
   occur within.

Internet-Draft         Structured Headers for HTTP             July 2019


   Implementations MUST provide access to dictionaries both by index and
   by name.  Specifications MAY use either means of accessing the
   members.

   The ABNF for dictionaries in textual HTTP headers is:

   sh-dictionary  = dict-member *( OWS "," OWS dict-member )
   dict-member    = member-name "=" member-value
   member-name    = key
   member-value   = sh-item / inner-list

   In textual HTTP headers, members are separated by a comma with
   optional whitespace, while names and values are separated by "="
   (without whitespace).  For example:

   Example-DictHeader: en="Applepie", da=*w4ZibGV0w6ZydGU=*

   A dictionary with a member whose value is an inner-list of tokens:

   Example-DictListHeader: rating=1.5, feelings=(joy sadness)

   Typically, a header field specification will define the semantics of
   individual member names, as well as whether their presence is
   required or optional.  Recipients MUST ignore names that are
   undefined or unknown, unless the header field's specification
   specifically disallows them.

   Parsers MUST support dictionaries containing at least 1024 name/value
   pairs, and names with at least 64 characters.

3.3.  Items

   An item is can be a integer (Section 3.4), float (Section 3.5),
   string (Section 3.6), token (Section 3.7), byte sequence
   (Section 3.8), or Boolean (Section 3.9).

   The ABNF for items in textual HTTP headers is:

   sh-item = sh-integer / sh-float / sh-string / sh-token / sh-binary
             / sh-boolean

3.4.  Integers

   Integers have a range of -999,999,999,999,999 to 999,999,999,999,999
   inclusive (i.e., up to fifteen digits, signed), for IEEE 754
   compatibility ([IEEE754]).

   The ABNF for integers in textual HTTP headers is:

Internet-Draft         Structured Headers for HTTP             July 2019


   sh-integer = ["-"] 1*15DIGIT

   For example:

   Example-IntegerHeader: 42

   Note that commas in integers are used in this section's prose only
   for readability; they are not valid in the wire format.

3.5.  Floats

   Floats are integers with a fractional part, that can be stored as
   IEEE 754 double precision numbers (binary64) ([IEEE754]).

   The ABNF for floats in textual HTTP headers is:

   sh-float    = ["-"] (
                DIGIT "." 1*14DIGIT /
               2DIGIT "." 1*13DIGIT /
               3DIGIT "." 1*12DIGIT /
               4DIGIT "." 1*11DIGIT /
               5DIGIT "." 1*10DIGIT /
               6DIGIT "." 1*9DIGIT /
               7DIGIT "." 1*8DIGIT /
               8DIGIT "." 1*7DIGIT /
               9DIGIT "." 1*6DIGIT /
              10DIGIT "." 1*5DIGIT /
              11DIGIT "." 1*4DIGIT /
              12DIGIT "." 1*3DIGIT /
              13DIGIT "." 1*2DIGIT /
              14DIGIT "." 1DIGIT )

   For example, a header whose value is defined as a float could look
   like:

   Example-FloatHeader: 4.5

3.6.  Strings

   Strings are zero or more printable ASCII [RFC0020] characters (i.e.,
   the range 0x20 to 0x7E).  Note that this excludes tabs, newlines,
   carriage returns, etc.

   The ABNF for strings in textual HTTP headers is:







Nottingham & Kamp        Expires January 9, 2020                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft         Structured Headers for HTTP             July 2019


   sh-string = DQUOTE *(chr) DQUOTE
   chr       = unescaped / escaped
   unescaped = %x20-21 / %x23-5B / %x5D-7E
   escaped   = "\" ( DQUOTE / "\" )

   In textual HTTP headers, strings are delimited with double quotes,
   using a backslash ("\") to escape double quotes and backslashes.  For
   example:

   Example-StringHeader: "hello world"

   Note that strings only use DQUOTE as a delimiter; single quotes do
   not delimit strings.  Furthermore, only DQUOTE and "\" can be
   escaped; other sequences MUST cause parsing to fail.

   Unicode is not directly supported in this document, because it causes
   a number of interoperability issues, and - with few exceptions -
   header values do not require it.

   When it is necessary for a field value to convey non-ASCII string
   content, a byte sequence (Section 3.8) SHOULD be specified, along
   with a character encoding (preferably UTF-8).

   Parsers MUST support strings with at least 1024 characters.

3.7.  Tokens

   Tokens are short textual words; their abstract model is identical to
   their expression in the textual HTTP serialisation.

   The ABNF for tokens in textual HTTP headers is:

   sh-token = ALPHA
              *( ALPHA / DIGIT / "_" / "-" / "." / ":" / "%"
                 / "*" / "/" )

   Parsers MUST support tokens with at least 512 characters.

   Note that a Structured Header token is not the same as the "token"
   ABNF rule defined in [RFC7230].

3.8.  Byte Sequences

   Byte sequences can be conveyed in Structured Headers.

   The ABNF for a byte sequence in textual HTTP headers is:





Nottingham & Kamp        Expires January 9, 2020               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft         Structured Headers for HTTP             July 2019


   sh-binary = "*" *(base64) "*"
   base64    = ALPHA / DIGIT / "+" / "/" / "="

   In textual HTTP headers, a byte sequence is delimited with asterisks
   and encoded using base64 ([RFC4648], Section 4).  For example:

   Example-BinaryHdr: *cHJldGVuZCB0aGlzIGlzIGJpbmFyeSBjb250ZW50Lg==*

   Parsers MUST support byte sequences with at least 16384 octets after
   decoding.

3.9.  Booleans

   Boolean values can be conveyed in Structured Headers.

   The ABNF for a Boolean in textual HTTP headers is:

   sh-boolean = "?" boolean
   boolean    = "0" / "1"

   In textual HTTP headers, a boolean is indicated with a leading "?"
   character.  For example:

   Example-BoolHdr: ?1

4.  Working With Structured Headers in Textual HTTP Headers

   This section defines how to serialize and parse Structured Headers in
   textual header fields, and protocols compatible with them (e.g., in
   HTTP/2 [RFC7540] before HPACK [RFC7541] is applied).

4.1.  Serializing Structured Headers

   Given a structure defined in this specification:

   1.  If the structure is a dictionary or list and its value is empty

4.2.  Parsing Header Fields into Structured Headers

   When a receiving implementation parses textual HTTP header fields
   that are known to be Structured Headers, it is important that care be
   taken, as there are a number of edge cases that can cause
   interoperability or even security problems.  This section specifies
   the algorithm for doing so.

   Given an array of bytes input_bytes that represents the chosen
   header's field-value (which is an empty string if that header is not
   present), and header_type (one of "dictionary", "list", or "item"),
   return the parsed header value.

   1.  Convert input_bytes into an ASCII string input_string; if
       conversion fails, fail parsing.

   2.  Discard any leading OWS from input_string.

   3.  If header_type is "list", let output be the result of Parsing a
       List from Text (Section 4.2.1).

   4.  If header_type is "dictionary", let output be the result of
       Parsing a Dictionary from Text (Section 4.2.2).

   5.  If header_type is "item", let output be the result of Parsing an
       Item from Text (Section 4.2.4).

   6.  Discard any leading OWS from input_string.

   7.  If input_string is not empty, fail parsing.

   8.  Otherwise, return output.

Internet-Draft         Structured Headers for HTTP             July 2019


   When generating input_bytes, parsers MUST combine all instances of
   the target header field into one comma-separated field-value, as per
   [RFC7230], Section 3.2.2; this assures that the header is processed
   correctly.

   For Lists and Dictionaries, this has the effect of correctly
   concatenating all instances of the header field, as long as
   individual individual members of the top-level data structure are not
   split across multiple header instances.

   Strings split across multiple header instances will have
   unpredictable results, because comma(s) and whitespace inserted upon
   combination will become part of the string output by the parser.
   Since concatenation might be done by an upstream intermediary, the
   results are not under the control of the serializer or the parser.

   Tokens, Integers, Floats and Byte Sequences cannot be split across
   multiple headers because the inserted commas will cause parsing to
   fail.

   If parsing fails - including when calling another algorithm - the
   entire header field's value MUST be discarded.  This is intentionally
   strict, to improve interoperability and safety, and specifications
   referencing this document are not allowed to loosen this requirement.

4.2.1.  Parsing a List from Text

   Given an ASCII string input_string, return an array of (member,
   parameters). input_string is modified to remove the parsed value.

   1.  Let members be an empty array.

       1.  Let member be the result of running Parsing a Parameterized
           Member from Text (Section 4.2.1.1) with input_string.

       2.  Append member to members.

       3.  Discard any leading OWS from input_string.

       4.  If input_string is empty, return members.

       5.  Consume the first character of input_string; if it is not
           COMMA, fail parsing.

       6.  Discard any leading OWS from input_string.

   5.  Reached the end of input_string without finding a closing DQUOTE;
       fail parsing.

4.2.7.  Parsing a Token from Text

   Given an ASCII string input_string, return a token. input_string is
   modified to remove the parsed value.

   1.  If the first character of input_string is not ALPHA, fail
       parsing.

   2.  Let output_string be an empty string.

   3.  While input_string is not empty:

       1.  Let char be the result of consuming the first character of
           input_string.

           1.  Prepend char to input_string.

           2.  Return output_string.

       3.  Append char to output_string.

   4.  Return output_string.

4.2.8.  Parsing a Byte Sequence from Text

   Given an ASCII string input_string, return a byte sequence.
   input_string is modified to remove the parsed value.

   1.  If the first character of input_string is not "*", fail parsing.

   2.  Discard the first character of input_string.

   3.  If there is not a "*" character before the end of input_string,
       fail parsing.

   4.  Let b64_content be the result of consuming content of
       input_string up to but not including the first instance of the
       character "*".

   5.  Consume the "*" character at the beginning of input_string.

   6.  If b64_content contains a character not included in ALPHA, DIGIT,
       "+", "/" and "=", fail parsing.

   7.  Let binary_content be the result of Base 64 Decoding [RFC4648]
       b64_content, synthesizing padding if necessary (note the
       requirements about recipient behaviour below).

   8.  Return binary_content.

   Because some implementations of base64 do not allow reject of encoded
   data that is not properly "=" padded (see [RFC4648], Section 3.2),
   parsers SHOULD NOT fail when it is not present, unless they cannot be
   configured to do so.

   Because some implementations of base64 do not allow rejection of
   encoded data that has non-zero pad bits (see [RFC4648], Section 3.5),
   parsers SHOULD NOT fail when it is present, unless they cannot be
   configured to do so.

   This specification does not relax the requirements in [RFC4648],
   Section 3.1 and 3.3; therefore, parsers MUST fail on characters
   outside the base64 alphabet, and on line feeds in encoded data.

4.2.9.  Parsing a Boolean from Text

   Given an ASCII string input_string, return a Boolean. input_string is
   modified to remove the parsed value.

   1.  If the first character of input_string is not "?", fail parsing.

   2.  Discard the first character of input_string.

   3.  If the first character of input_string matches "1", discard the
       first character, and return true.

   4.  If the first character of input_string matches "0", discard the
       first character, and return false.

   5.  No value has matched; fail parsing.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This draft has no actions for IANA.

6.  Security Considerations

   The size of most types defined by Structured Headers is not limited;
   as a result, extremely large header fields could be an attack vector
   (e.g., for resource consumption).  Most HTTP implementations limit
   the sizes of individual header fields as well as the overall header
   block size to mitigate such attacks.

   It is possible for parties with the ability to inject new HTTP header
   fields to change the meaning of a Structured Header.  In some
   circumstances, this will cause parsing to fail, but it is not
   possible to reliably fail in all such circumstances.

Appendix A.  Acknowledgements

   Many thanks to Matthew Kerwin for his detailed feedback and careful
   consideration during the development of this specification.

Appendix B.  Frequently Asked Questions

B.1.  Why not JSON?

   Earlier proposals for structured headers were based upon JSON
   [RFC8259].  However, constraining its use to make it suitable for
   HTTP header fields required senders and recipients to implement
   specific additional handling.

   For example, JSON has specification issues around large numbers and
   objects with duplicate members.  Although advice for avoiding these
   issues is available (e.g., [RFC7493]), it cannot be relied upon.

   Likewise, JSON strings are by default Unicode strings, which have a
   number of potential interoperability issues (e.g., in comparison).
   Although implementers can be advised to avoid non-ASCII content where
   unnecessary, this is difficult to enforce.

   Another example is JSON's ability to nest content to arbitrary
   depths.  Since the resulting memory commitment might be unsuitable
   (e.g., in embedded and other limited server deployments), it's
   necessary to limit it in some fashion; however, existing JSON
   implementations have no such limits, and even if a limit is




Nottingham & Kamp        Expires January 9, 2020               [Page 28]

   specified, it's likely that some header field definition will find a
   need to violate it.

   Because of JSON's broad adoption and implementation, it is difficult
   to impose such additional constraints across all implementations;
   some deployments would fail to enforce them, thereby harming
   interoperability.  In short, if it looks like JSON, people will be
   tempted to use a JSON parser / serialiser on header fields.

   Since a major goal for Structured Headers is to improve
   interoperability and simplify implementation, these concerns led to a
   format that requires a dedicated parser and serializer.

   Additionally, there were widely shared feelings that JSON doesn't
   "look right" in HTTP headers.

B.2.  Structured Headers don't "fit" my data.

   Structured headers intentionally limits the complexity of data
   structures, to assure that it can be processed in a performant manner
   with little overhead.  This means that work is necessary to fit some
   data types into them.

   Sometimes, this can be achieved by creating limited substructures in
   values, and/or using more than one header.  For example, consider:

   Example-Thing: name="Widget", cost=89.2, descriptions=(foo bar)
   Example-Description: foo; url="https://example.net"; context=123,
                        bar; url="https://example.org"; context=456

   Since the description contains an array of key/value pairs, we use a
   List to represent them, with the token for each item in the array
   used to identify it in the "descriptions" member of the Example-Thing
   header.

   When specifying more than one header, it's important to remember to
   describe what a processor's behaviour should be when one of the
   headers is missing.

   If you need to fit arbitrarily complex data into a header, Structured
   Headers is probably a poor fit for your use case.

Appendix C.  Implementation Notes

   A generic implementation of this specification should expose the top-
   level parse (Section 4.2) and serialize (Section 4.1) functions.
   They need not be functions; for example, it could be implemented as
   an object, with methods for each of the different top-level types.

Internet-Draft         Structured Headers for HTTP             July 2019


   For interoperability, it's important that generic implementations be
   complete and follow the algorithms closely; see Section 1.1.  To aid
   this, a common test suite is being maintained by the community; see
   https://github.com/httpwg/structured-header-tests [7].

   Implementers should note that dictionaries and parameters are order-
   preserving maps.  Some headers may not convey meaning in the ordering
   of these data types, but it should still be exposed so that
   applications which need to use it will have it available.

   Likewise, implementations should note that it's important to preserve
   the distinction between tokens and strings.  While most programming
   languages have native types that map to the other types well, it may
   be necessary to create a wrapper "token" object or use a parameter on
   functions to assure that these types remain separate.
