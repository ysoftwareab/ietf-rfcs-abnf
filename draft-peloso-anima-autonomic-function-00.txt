               A Day in the Life of an Autonomic Function
                draft-peloso-anima-autonomic-function-00

Abstract

   While autonomic functions are often pre-installed and integrated with
   the network elements they manage, this is not a mandatory condition.
   Allowing autonomic functions to be dynamically installed and to
   control resources remotely enables more versatile deployment
   approaches and enlarges the application scope to virtually any legacy
   equipment.  The analysis of autonomic functions deployment schemes
   through the installation, instantiation and operation phases allows
   constructing a unified life-cycle and identifying new required
   functionality.  Thus, the introduction of autonomic technologies will
   be facilitated, the adoption much more rapid and broad.  Operators
   will benefit from multi-vendor, interoperable autonomic functions
   with homogeneous operations and superior quality, and will have more
   freedom in their deployment scenarios.

1.  Problem statement

   While autonomic functions are often pre-installed and integrated with
   the network elements they manage, this is not a mandatory condition.
   Allowing autonomic functions to be dynamically installed and to
   control resources remotely enables more versatile deployment
   approaches and enlarges the application scope to virtually any legacy
   equipment.  The analysis of autonomic functions deployment schemes
   through the installation, instantiation and operation phases allows
   constructing a unified life-cycle and identifying new required
   functionality.

   An Autonomic Function Agent (AFA) controls resources of one or
   multiple Network Elements (NE), e.g. the interfaces of a router for a
   Load Balancing AFA.  An AFA is a software, thus an AFA need first to
   be installed and to execute on a host machine in order to control
   resources.

   There are 3 properties applicable to the installation of AFAs:

   The dynamic installation property  allows installing an AFA on
      demand, on any hosts compatible with the AFA.

   The decoupling property  allows controlling resources of a NE from a
      remote AFA, i.e. an AFA installed on a host machine different from
      the resources' NE.

   The multiplicity property  allows controlling multiple sets of
      resources from a single AFA.

   These three properties provide the operator a great variety of AFA
   deployment schemes as they decorrelate the evolution of the
   infrastructure layer from the evolution of the autonomic function
   layer.  Depending on the capabilities (and constraints) of the
   infrastructure and of the autonomic functions, the operator can
   devise the schemes that will better fit to its deployment objectives
   and practices.

   Based on the above definitions, the AFA deployment process can be
   formulated as a multi-level/criteria matching problem.

   The primary level, present in the three phases, consists in matching
   the objectives of the operator and the capabilities of the
   infrastructure.  The secondary level criteria may vary from phase to
   phase.  One goal of the document is thus to identify the specific and
   common functionality among three phases.

Internet-Draft             Autonomic Function               October 2015


   This draft will explore the implications of these properties along
   each of the 3 phases namely Installation, Instantiation and
   Operation.  This draft will then provide a synthesis of these
   implications in requirements for functionalities and life-cyle of
   AFAs.  Beforehand, the following section will deal with the network
   operator's point of view with regards of autonomic networks.

2.  Motivations from an operator viewpoint

   Only few operators would dare relying on a pure autonomic network,
   without setting objectives to it.  From an operator to the other, the
   strategy of network management vary, as much for historical reasons
   (experience, best-practice, tools in-place, organization), as much
   for differences in the operators goals (business, trade agreements,
   politics, risk policy).  Additionally, network operators do not
   necessarily perform a uniform network management across the different
   domains composing their network infrastructure.  Hence their
   objectives in terms of availability, load, and dynamics vary
   depending on the nature of the domains and of the types of services
   running over each of those domains.

   To manage the networks according to the above variations, AFAs need
   to capture the underlying objectives implied by the operators.  The
   instantiation phase is the step in-between installation and
   operation, where the network operator determine the initial AFA
   behavior according to its objectives.  This step allows the network
   operator to determine which AFAs should execute on which domains of
   its network, with appropriate settings.  At this stage, thanks to the
   intent-policy setting objectives to groups of AFAs, the network
   management should become far simpler (and less error-prone) than
   setting low-level configurations for each individual network
   resources.

2.1.  Illustration of increasingly constraining operator's objectives

   This paragraph describes the following example of operator intents
   with regards to deployments of autonomic functions.  The autonomic
   function involved is a load balancing function, which uses monitoring
   results of links load to autonomously modify the links metrics in
   order to balance the load over the network.  The example is divided
   into steps corresponding to an increasing implication of the operator
   in the definition of objectives/intents to the deployment of
   autonomic functions:

   Step 1  The operator operates its network and benefits from the
      autonomic function on the nodes which have the installed AFAs.

Internet-Draft             Autonomic Function               October 2015


   Step 2  Then the operator, specifies to the autonomic function an
      objective which is to achieve the maximum number of links with a
      load below 6O%.

   Step 3  The network is composed of five domains, a core transport
      network and four metropolitan networks, each interconnected
      through the core network, the operator sets a different objective
      to the autonomic function for each of the five domain.

   Step 4  As inside metropolitan domains the traffic variations are
      steeper and happen in a periodic fashion contrary to the traffic
      in the core domain, the network operators installs an additional
      autonomic function inside each of these domains.  This autonomic
      function is learning the traffic demands in order to predict
      traffic variations.  The operators instructs the load balancing
      function to augment its monitored input with the traffic
      predictions issued by the newly installed autonomic function.

   Step 5  As the algorithm of the load balancing autonomic function is
      relying on interactions between autonomic function agents, the
      operator expects the interactions to happen in-between AFAs of
      each domain, hence the load will be balanced inside each of the
      domain, while previously it would have been balanced over the
      whole network uniformly.

   Step 6  Finally, the network operator has purchased a new piece of
      software corresponding to an autonomic function achieving load
      balancing with a more powerful algorithm.  For trial sake, he
      decides to deploy this new load balancing function instead of the
      previous one on one of its four metropolitan domains.

   This short example illustrates some specificities of deployment
   scenarios, the sub-section below sets itself at providing a more
   exhaustive view of the different deployment scenarios.

2.2.  Deployment scenarios of autonomic functions

   The following scenarios illustrate the different ways the autonomic
   functions could be deployed in an ANIMA context.  Subsequently,
   requirements for the autonomic functions and requirements these
   autonomic functions impose on other components of the ANIMA ecosystem
   are listed.

   These various deployment scenarios are better understood by referring
   to the High level view of an Autonomic Network, Figure 1 of
   [I-D.behringer-anima-reference-model].  The figure is slightly
   extended for the purpose of the demonstration as follows:

             Figure 1: High level view of an Autonomic Network

   Figure 1 depicts 4 Nodes, 4 Autonomic Functions and 10 Autonomic
   Function Agents.  Let's list assumptions with regards of these
   elements.

   Starting with nodes,

      each may be either an Unconstrained Autonomic Node, a Constrained
      Autonomic Node (or even a legacy one?),

      they may well be of different models (or having different software
      versions),

      they may well be of different equipment vendors,

      they may well be of different technologies (some may be IP
      routers, some may be Ethernet switches or OTN switches...).

   Pursuing with Autonomic Functions,

      they may well have different objectives (one could target
      automatic configuration of OSPF-TE, while another one is
      optimizing traffic load), but they may well have identical

Internet-Draft             Autonomic Function               October 2015


      objectives as two could optimize energy consumption (possibly on
      different areas as function 3 and function 4),

      each may be composed of no more than one AFA (either because the
      function is responsible for a single node or because the function
      relies on a centralized implementation),

      each may well be composed of different sort of AFAs, meaning the
      software is different (either because their version number is
      different, or because the software provider is different, or
      because their respective nodes/equipments differ or because the
      role of each agent is different),

      [Observation] Depending on the implementation the same piece of
      software may fulfil different roles or each role may come from a
      different from a different piece of code,

      [Observation] Depending on the implementation the same piece of
      software may fulfil different roles or each role may provide from
      a different piece of code,

      each has reached a given organization, meaning an organized set of
      AFAs in charge of a set of nodes ()whether formalized or not),
      this organization may either come from the piece of software
      itself (e.g. embedding a self-organization process) or come from
      directions of the network operator (e.g. through intents/policies,
      or through deployment instructions)

      each may work internally in a peer to peer fashion (where every
      agents have the same prerogatives) or in hierarchical fashion
      (where some agents have some prerogatives over other) [this option
      is a good example of role differences],

      each having its scope of work in terms of objective to reach and
      area/space/part of the network to manage.

   Completing with individual Autonomic Function Agents, those are
   pieces of software:

      embedded inside the node/equipment OS (hence present since the
      bootstrap or OS update of the equipment),

      running in a machine different than the node (this could be a node
      controller or any other host or virtual machine)

      [Observation] In the latter case, the AFA would likely require
      external credentials to interact with the node,

      directly monitoring and configuring the equipment (likely requires
      the AFA to be embedded) or through a management interface of the
      equipment (e.g.  SNMP, TL1, Q3, NetConf) or through an equipment
      controller (e.g.  SDN paradigm) or through a network manager (e.g.
      using the north interface of the manager)

      either activated at start-up or as the result of a management
      action,

      may be installed (either inside the equipment or on a different
      machine) when requested by an operator from a software origin
      (e.g. a repository in the ACP, a media)

      provided by the same vendor as the equipment it manages or by any
      third party (like another equipment vendor, a management software
      vendor, an open-source initiative or the operator software team),

      sharing a technical objective with the other AFAs of the Autonomic
      Function they belong, (or at least a similar one)?

      can it contains multiple technical objective?

      must the technical objective be intrinsic or can it be set by a
      managing entity (a network operator or a management system)?

   The last three points being largely questionable are marked as
   questions.

   The figure below illustrates how an AFA interacts with a node that
   the AFA manages.  The left side depicts external interactions,
   through exchange of commands towards interfaces either to the node OS
   (e.g. via SNMP or NetConf), or to the controller (e.g.  (G)MPLS, SDN,
   ...), or to the NMS.  The right side depicts the case of the AFA
   embedded inside the Node OS.

2.3.  Operator's requirements with regards to autonomic functions

   Regarding the operators, at this point we can try to list few
   requirements they may have with regards with the Autonomic Functions
   and their management...

      Being capable to set those functions a scope of work in term of
      area of duty,

      Being capable to monitor the actions taken by the autonomic
      functions, and which are its results (performance with regards to
      the function KPIs)

      Being capable to halt/suspend the execution of an Autonomic
      function (either because the function is untrusted, or because an
      operation on the network is to be conducted without interference
      from the autonomic functions, etc...)

      Being capable to configure the autonomic functions by adjusting
      the parameters of the function (e.g. a Traffic Engineering
      autonomic function may achieve a trade-off between congestion
      avoidance and electrical power consumption, hence this function
      may be more or less aggressive on the link load ratio, and the
      network operator certainly has his word to say in setting this
      cursor.

3.  Installation phase

   Before being able to instantiate and run AFAs, the operator must
   first provision the infrastructure with the sets of AFA software
   corresponding to its needs and objectives.  The provisioning of the
   infrastructure is realized in the installation phase and consists in
   installing (or checking the availability of) the pieces of software
   of the different AFA classes in a set of Installation Hosts.

   As mentioned in the Problem statement section, an Autonomic Function
   Agent (AFA) controls resources of one or multiple Network Elements
   (NE), e.g. the interfaces of a router for a Load Balancing AFA.  An
   AFA is a software, thus an AFA need first to be installed and to
   execute on a host machine in order to control resources.

   There are 3 properties applicable to the installation of AFAs:

   The dynamic installation property  allows installing an AFA on
      demand, on any hosts compatible with the AFA.

   The decoupling property  allows controlling resources of a NE from a
      remote AFA, i.e. an AFA installed on a host machine different from
      the resources' NE.

   The multiplicity property  allows controlling multiple sets of
      resources from a single AFA.

   These three properties are very important in the context of the
   installation phase as their variations condition how the AFA class
   could be installed on the infrastructure.

3.1.  Operator's goal

   In the installation phase, the operator's goal is to install AFA
   classes on Installation Hosts such that, at the moment of
   instantiation, the corresponding AFAs can control the sets of target
   resources.  The complexity of the installation phase come from the
   number of possible configurations for the matching between the AFA
   classes capabilities (e.g. what types of resources it can control,
   what types of hosts it can be installed on...), the Installation
   Hosts capabilities (e.g. support dynamic installation, location and
   reachability...) and the operator's needs (what deployment schemes
   are favoured, functionality coverage vs. cost trade-off...).

   For example, in the coupled mode, the AFA host machine and the
   network element are the same.  The AFA is installed on the network
   element and control the resources via interfaces and mechanisms
   internal to the network element.  An AFA MUST be installed on the

Internet-Draft             Autonomic Function               October 2015


   network element of every resource controlled by the AFA.  The
   identification of the resources controlled by an AFA is
   straightforward: the resources are the ones of the network element.

   In the decoupled mode, the AFA host machine is different from the
   network element.  The AFA is installed on the host machine and
   control the resources via interfaces and mechanisms external to the
   network element.  An AFA can be installed on an arbitrary set of
   candidate Installation hosts, which can be defined explicitly by the
   network operator or according to a cost function.  A key benefit of
   the decoupled mode is to allow an easier introduction of autonomic
   functions on existing (legacy) infrastructure.  The decoupled mode
   also allows de-correlating the installation requirements (compatible
   host machines) from the infrastructure evolution (NEs addition and
   removal, change of NE technology/version...).

   The operator's goal may be defined as a special type of intent,
   called the Installation phase intent.  The details of the content and
   format of this proposed intent are left open and for further study.

3.2.  Installation phase inputs and outputs

   Inputs are:

   [AFA class of type_x]  that specifies which classes AFAs to install,

   [Installation_target_Infrastructure]  that specifies the candidate
      Installation Hosts,

   [AFA class placement function]  e.g. under which criteria/constraints
      as defined by the operator that specifies how the installation
      phase shall meet the operator's needs and objectives for the
      provision of the infrastructure.  In the coupled mode, the
      placement function is not necessary, whereas in the decoupled
      mode, the placement function is mandatory, even though it can be
      as simple as an explicit list of Installation hosts.

   The main output of the installation phase is an up-to-date directory
   of installed AFAs which corresponds to [list of AFA classes]
   installed on [list of installation Hosts].  This output is also
   useful for the coordination function and corresponds to the static
   interaction map.

   The condition to validate in order to pass to next phase is to ensure
   that [list of AFA classes] are well installed on [list of
   installation Hosts].  The state of the AFA at the end of the
   installation phase is: installed. (not instantiated).  The following
   commands or messages are foreseen: install(list of AFA classes,

Internet-Draft             Autonomic Function               October 2015


   Installation_target_Infrastructure, AFA class placement function),
   and un-install (list of AFA classes).

4.  Instantiation phase

   Once the AFAs are installed on the appropriate hosts in the network,
   these AFA may start to operate.  From the operator viewpoint, an
   operating AFA means the AFA manages the network resources as per the
   objectives given.  At the AFA local level, operating means executing
   their control loop/algorithm.

   But right before that, there are two things to take into
   consideration.  First, there is a difference between 1. having a
   piece of code available to run on a host and 2. having an agent based
   on this piece of code running inside the host.  Second, in a coupled
   case, determining which resources are controlled by an AFA is
   straightforward (the determination is embedded), in a decoupled mode
   determining this is a bit more complex (hence a starting agent will
   have to either discover or be taught it).

   The instantiation phase of an AFA covers both these aspects: starting
   the agent piece of code (when this does not start automatically) and
   determining which resources have to be controlled (when this is not
   obvious).

4.1.  Operator's goal

   Through this phase, the operator wants to control its autonomic
   network in two things:

   1  determine the scope of autonomic functions by instructing which of
      the network resources have to be managed by which autonomic
      function (and more precisely which class e.g. 1. version X or
      version Y or 2. provider A or provider B),

   2  determine how the autonomic functions are organized by instructing
      which AFAs have to interact with which other AFAs (or more
      precisely which set of network resources have to be handled as an
      autonomous group by their managing AFAs).

   Additionally in this phase, the operator may want to set objectives
   to autonomic functions, by configuring the AFAs technical objectives.

   The operator's goal can be summarized in an instruction to the ANIMA
   ecosystem matching the following pattern:

Internet-Draft             Autonomic Function               October 2015


      [AFA of type_x instances] ready to control
      [Instantiation_target_Infrastructure] with
      [Instantiation_target_parameters]

4.2.  Instantiation phase inputs and outputs

   Inputs are:

   [AFA of type_x instances]  that specifies which are the AFAs to be
      targeted (and more precisely which class e.g. 1. version X or
      version Y or 2. provider A or provider B),

   [Instantiation_target_Infrastructure]  that specifies which are the
      resources to be managed by the autonomic function, this can be the
      whole network or a subset of it like a domain a technology segment
      or even a specific list of resources,

   [Instantiation_target_parameters]  that specifies which are the
      technical objectives to be set to AFAs (e.g. an optimization
      target)

   Outputs are:

   [Set of AFAs - Resources relations]  describing which resources are
      managed by which AFA instances, this is not a formal message, but
      a resulting configuration of a set of AFAs,

4.3.  Instantiation phase requirements

   The instructions described in section 4.2 could be either:

   sent to a targeted AFA  In which case, the receiving Agent will have
      to manage the specified list of
      [Instantiation_target_Infrastructure], with the
      [Instantiation_target_parameters].

   broadcast to all AFAs  In which case, the AFAs would collectively
      determine from the list which Agent(s) would handle which
      [Instantiation_target_Infrastructure], with the
      [Instantiation_target_parameters].

   This set of instructions can be materialized through a message that
   is named an Instance Mandate.  Instance Mandates are described in the
   requirements part of this document, which lists the needed fields of
   such a message (see Section 6.3 - AFA Instance Mandate).

   The conclusion of this instantiation phase is a ready to operate AFA
   (or interacting set of AFAs), then this (or those) AFA(s) can



Peloso & Ciavaglia       Expires April 21, 2016                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft             Autonomic Function               October 2015


   describe themselves by depicting which are the resources they manage
   and what this means in terms of metrics being monitored and in terms
   of actions that can be executed (like modifying the parameters
   values).  A message conveying such a self description is named an
   Instance Manifest.  Instance Manifests are described in the
   requirements part of this document, which lists the needed fields of
   such a message (see Section 6.4 - AFA Instance Manifest).

   Though the operator may well use such a self-description "per se",
   the final goal of such a description is to be shared with other ANIMA
   entities like:

   o  the coordination entities (see [I-D.ciavaglia-anima-coordination]
      - Autonomic Functions Coordination)

   o  collaborative entities in the purpose of establishing knowledge
      exchanges (some AFAs may produce knowledge or even monitor metrics
      that other AFAs cannot make by themselves why those would be
      useful for their execution) (see knowledge exchange items in
      Section 5 - Operation phase)

5.  Operation phase

   Note: This section is to be further developed in future revisions of
   the document.

   During the Operation phase, the operator can:

      Activate/Deactivate AFA: meaning enabling those to execute their
      autonomic loop or not.

      Modify AFAs targets: meaning setting them different objectives.

      Modify AFAs managed resources: by updating the instance mandate
      which would specify different set of resources to manage (only
      applicable to decouples AFAs).

   During the Operation phase, running AFAs can interact the one with
   the other:

      in order to exchange knowledge (e.g. an AFA providing traffic
      predictions to load balancing AFA)

      in order to collaboratively reach an objective (e.g.  AFAs
      pertaining to the same autonomic function targeted to manage a
      network domain, these AFA will collaborate - in the case of a load
      balancing one, by modifying the links metrics according to the
      neighbouring resources loads)

Internet-Draft             Autonomic Function               October 2015


   During the Operation phase, running AFAs are expected to apply
   coordination schemes

      then execute their control loop under coordination supervision/
      instructions

6.  Autonomic Function Agent specifications

6.1.  Life-cycle

   Based on the phases described above, this section defines formally
   the different states experienced by Autonomic Function Agents during
   their complete life-cycle.

   The drawing of the life-cycle presented below shows both the states
   and the events/messages triggering the state changes.  For
   simplification purposes, this sketch does not display the transitory
   states which correspond to the handling of the messages.

   The installation and Instantiation phase will be concluded by AFA
   reaching respectively Installed and Instantiated states.

            Figure 3: Life cycle of an Autonomic Function Agent

   Here are described the successive states of AFA.

   Undeployed -   In this "state", the Autonomic Function Agent is a
      mere piece of software, which may not even be available on any
      host.

Internet-Draft             Autonomic Function               October 2015


   Installed -   In this state, the Autonomic Function Agent is
      available on a (/multiple) host(s), and after having shared its
      AFA class Manifest (which describes in a generic way independently
      of the deployment how the AFA would work).  In this state the AFA
      is waiting for an AFA Instance Mandate, to determine which
      resources it manage (when the AFA is strictly coupled to resources
      [e.g. part of a Node OS], there is no need to wait for an instance
      mandate, the target resources being intrinsically known).

   Instantiated -   In this state the Autonomic Function Agent has the
      knowledge of which resources it is meant to manage.  In this state
      the AFA is expecting a set Up message in order to start executing
      its autonomic loop.  From this state on the AFA can share an
      Instance Manifest (which describes how the AFA instance is going
      to work).

   Operational -   In this state, AFAs are executing their autonomic
      loop, hence acting on network, by modifying resources parameters.
      A set down message will turn back the AFA in an Instantiated
      state.

   The messages are described in the following sections.

6.2.  AFA Class Manifest

   An AFA class is a piece of software that contains the computer
   program of an Autonomic Function Agent.

   In order to install and instantiate appropriately an autonomic
   function in its network, the operator needs to know which are the
   characteristics of this piece of software.

   This section details a format for an AFA class manifest, which is (a
   machine-readable) description of both the autonomic function and the
   piece of code that executes the function.

6.3.  AFA Instance Mandate

   An AFA instance is the AFA agent: a running piece of software of an
   AFA class.  A software agent is a persistent, goal-oriented computer
   program that reacts to its environment and interacts with other
   elements of the network.

   In order to install and instantiate appropriately an autonomic
   function in its network, the operator may specify to AFA instances
   what they are supposed to do: in term of which resources to manage
   and which objective to reach.

   This section details a format for an AFA Instance Mandate, which is
   (a machine-readable) set of instructions sent to create autonomic
   functions out of AFA.

   |           |                | (e.g. time wise and content wise)    |
   +-----------+----------------+--------------------------------------+

                  Table 2: Fields of AFA instance mandate

   An AFA instance mandate could be either:

   sent to a targeted AFA  In which case, the receiving Agent will have
      to manage the specified list of resources,

   broadcast to all AFA  In which case, the AFAs would collectively
      determine which agent would handle which resources from the list,
      and if needed (and feasible) this could also trigger the dynamic
      installation/instantiation of new agents (ACP should be capable of
      bearing such scenarios).

6.4.  AFA Instance Manifest

   Once the AFAs are properly instantiated, the operator and its
   managing system need to know which are the characteristics of these
   AFAs.

7.  Implication for other ANIMA components

7.1.  Additional entities for ANIMA ecosystem

   In the previous parts of this document, we have seen successive
   operations pertaining to the management of autonomic functions.
   These phases involve different entities such as the AFAs, the AFA
   Hosts and the AFA Management function.  This function serves as the
   interface between the network operator and its managed infrastructure
   (i.e. the autonomic network).  The AFA management function
   distributes instructions to the AFAs such as the AFA Instance
   Mandate, AFA set up/set down commands and also trigger the AFA

   installation inside AFA Hosts.  This function is likely to be co-
   located or integrated with the function responsible for the
   management of the Intents.

   In this first version, we do not prescribe any requirements on the
   way the AFA Management function should be implemented, neither the
   various deployment options of such a function and neither on the way
   ACP or GRASP could be extended to interact with this function.  We
   believe these design and specifications work should be first
   discussed and analysed by the working group.

7.2.  Requirements for GRASP and ACP messages

   GRASP and ACP seems to be the best (and currently only) candidates to
   convey the following messages between the AFA Management function and
   the AFAs:

      AFA Class Manifest

      AFA Instance Mandate (and Revoke Mandate)

      AFA Instance Mandate

      Set Up and Set Down messages

   The way to convey these messages is to be handled by working group
   and protocol authors.

   A mechanism similar to the bootstrapping one would usefully achieve
   discovery of pre-installed AFAs, and possibly provide those with a
   default Instance Mandate.

   A mechanism to achieve dynamic installation of AFAs compatible with
   ACP and GRASP remains to be identified.

   In the case of decoupled AFAs, even more for the ones supporting
   multiplicity, when a Mandate is broadcast (i.e. requesting the
   Instantiation of an autonomic function to manage a bunch of
   resources), these AFAs require synchronization to determine which
   agent(s) will manage which resources.  Proper ACP/GRASP messages
   supporting such a mechanism have to be identified together with
   protocol authors.
