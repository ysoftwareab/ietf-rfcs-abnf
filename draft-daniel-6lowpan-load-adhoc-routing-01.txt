Internet-Draft                    LOAD                         July 2005


1.  Introduction

   The IEEE 802.15.4 standard [ieee802.15.4] targets low power personal
   area networks.  The "IPv6 over IEEE 802.15.4" document 
   [I-D.montenegro-lowpan-ipv6-over-802.15.4] defines basic 
   functionality required to carry IPv6 packets over IEEE 802.15.4
   networks (including an adaptation layer, header compression, etc).
   Likewise, the functionality required for packet delivery in IEEE
   802.15.4 meshes is defined, as mesh topologies are expected to be
   common in LoWPAN networks.  However, neither the IEEE 802.15.4
   standard nor the "IPv6 over IEEE 802.15.4" specification provide any
   information as to how such a mesh topology could be obtained and
   maintained.

   The 6LoWPAN Ad hoc Routing Protocol (LOAD) is a simplified on-demand
   routing protocol based on AODV[RFC3561] for 6LoWPAN. Besides the main 
   AODV specification [RFC3561], several efforts aim at simplifications 
   of the protocol, as in the AODVjr proposal [AODVjr] or the TinyAODV
   implementation [TinyAODV].  Similarly, DyMO allows for minimalist
   implementation leaving non-essential functionality as optional
   [I-D.ietf-manet-dymo].  LOAD enables multihop routing between IEEE 
   802.15.4 devices to establish and maintain routing routes in 6LoWPAN.

   This document defines the message formats, the data structures
   and the operations of LOAD.

2.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Overview

   This section describes the distinctive features of LOAD compared to
   AODV.  LOAD is defined to be operating on top of the adaptation layer
   instead of the transport layer. That is, it creates a mesh network 
   topology underneath and unbeknownst to IPv6 network layer.  IPv6
   sees a 6LoWPAN as a single link.  This is similar to how other 
   technologies regularly create complex structures underneath IP (e.g.,
   ethernet spanning tree bridges, token ring source routing, ATM, etc).
   LOAD control packets use the encapsulation defined in [I-D.montenegro
   -lowpan-ipv6-over-802.15.4].  All LOAD control packets shall use the
   prot_type value TBD (suggested value of 4).

   LOAD assumes the use of either one of the two different addresses for
   routing: the EUI-64 address and the 16 bit short address of the 
   6LoWPAN device.

Internet-Draft                    LOAD                         July 2005


   LOAD makes use of broadcast in its route discovery.  It does so in 
   order to propagate the Route Request (RREQ) messages.  In this 
   specification, such broadcast packets are obtained by setting the PAN 
   id to the broadcast PAN (0xffff) and by setting the destination 
   address to the broadcast short address (0xffff).

   LOAD doesn't use the destination sequence number to reduce the size
   of the control messages and simplify the route discovery process.
   For ensuring loop freedom, only the destination of a route SHOULD 
   generate a RREP in reply. The intermediate nodes SHOULD not responds
   with a RREP. By the same reason, LOAD does not use the "Gratuitous 
   RREP".

   LOAD MAY use the local repair for a link break during a data delivery.
   In a local repair, only the destination generates a RREP in reply 
   because of no use of the destination sequence number.

   If a local repair fails, LOAD MAY generate a Route Error (RERR) 
   message toward the originator of the data delivery to notify that the
   destination is no longer reachable by way of the broken link.  The 
   format of RERR is simplified to include only one unreachable 
   destination while the RERR of AODV MAY include multiple ones.

   LOAD does not use the "precursor list" of AODV to simplify the routing 
   table structure. Notice that AODV uses the precursors for forwarding
   RERR messages in the event of detection of the loss of the next hop 
   link. In LOAD, RERR is forwarded only to the originator of the failed 
   data delivery, thus no requring to use the precursor list.
   
   LOAD MAY use the route cost, which is the accumulated link cost from 
   the originator to the destination, as a metric of routing.  For this,
   LOAD utilizes the Link Quality Indicator (LQI) of the 6LoWPAN PHY 
   layer in the routing decision in addition to the hop distance. This 
   implies that LOAD MAY prefer a route of better link quality to a route 
   of shorter hop distance.

   LOAD SHOULD utilize the acknowledged transmission option at the 
   6LoWPAN MAC layer for keeping track of the connectivity of a route.
   LOAD does use neither the passive acknowledgements nor the HELLO 
   messages of AODV. 

   The basic operations of LOAD are route discovery, managing data 
   structures and maintaining local connections.  For these operations,
   LOAD maintains the following two tables: the routing table and the 
   route request table. The routing table stores route information such 
   as destination, next hop node, and status. The route request table 
   stores the temporary route information used in the route discovery 
   process.

   There are two different types of 6LoWPAN devices: the reduced 
   function device(RFD) and the full function device (FFD).  LOAD SHOULD 
   utilize only FFD for mesh routing. Thus, A FFD SHOULD implement the 
   operations of LOAD and maintain the data structures of LOAD.

4.  Terminology

   This section defines the terminology of LOAD that is not defined in
   [RFC3753] and [RFC3561].

      destination

         A node to which data packets are to be transmitted. Same as 
         "destination node".  

      forward route

         A route set up to send data packets from the originator to its 
         destination.

      link cost

         A Link Quality (LQ) between a node and its neighbor node.

      link quality indicator (LQI)

         A mechanism to measure the Link Quality (LQ) in IEEE 802.15.4
         PHY layer [ieee802.15.4].  It measures LQ by receiving the
         signal energy level.  A high LQ value implies the good quality
         of communication (i.e. low link cost).

      originator 

         A node that initiates a route discovery process. Same as 
         "originating node"

      route cost

         An accumulated link cost as a LOAD control message (RREQ or 
         RREP) passes through the nodes on the route. The accumulation 
         mechanism is TBD.

      reverse route

         A route set up to forward a RREP back to the originator 
         from the destination.  Same as "reverse route" in 
         [RFC3561].

6.  Operation

6.1  Generating Route Request

   The basic operations of LOAD include route discovery, managing data 
   structures and maintaining local connections.  A node maintains
   the following two tables for routing: the routing table and the 
   routing request table.

   During the discovery period, an originator, a node that requests a
   route discovery, generates a Route Request (RREQ) message with the
   RREQ ID which was incremented by one from the previous RREQ ID value.

   A node SHOULD NOT originate more than RREQ_RATELIMIT RREQs per second.
   After brocasting a RREQ, a node waits for a RREP. If a route is not
   discovered within NET_TRAVERSAL_TIME milliseconds, the node MAY try
   again the discovery process a maximum of RREQ_RETRIES times.

6.2  Processing and Forwarding Route Request

   Upon receiving a RREQ, an intermediate node tries to find the entry
   of the same originator address and RREQ ID pair in the route request
   table.  If the entry is found, the node just discards the RREQ.
   Otherwise, the node creates a reverse route to the originator in the 
   routing table and a RREQ entry in the route request table.  Then,
   the node forwards the RREQ.

6.3  Generating Route Reply

   When the destination receives a RREQ, it tries to find the entry of 
   the same originator address and RREQ ID pair in the route request 
   table. If the entry is found, the destination compares the route cost 
   of the RREQ with the forward route cost of the entry. If the cost of 
   the RREQ is better than (i.e. less than) that of the entry, the 
   destination updates the reverse route to the originator in the routing 
   table and generates a RREP in reply. If the cost of the RREQ is not 
   less than that of the entry, the destination just discards the RREQ.

6.4  Receiving and Forwarding Route Reply

   Upen receiving a RREP, an intermediate node checks whether it has a
   route entry for the destination of the RREP (i.e. the originator of
   the corresponding RREQ).  If it does not have the route entry, it
   just discards the RREP.  Otherwise, it also checks for the existence
   of the corresponding RREQ entry (which has the same RREQ ID and 
   originator address pair as that of the RREP) in the route request 
   table.  If there is no such entry, then it just discards the RREP. If

   there is such an entry and the entry has worse reverse route cost 
   (i.e. higher value) than the route cost of the RREP, the node updates 
   the entry with the information of the RREP and forwards it to the 
   previous hop node toward the destination of the RREP.  If the entry 
   has better reverse route cost (i.e. lower value) than that of the 
   RREP, the node just discards the RREP.

   During the delivery of the RREP to the originator, the route cost
   value of the RREP is accumulated on the reverse route from the 
   destination to the originator.  The accumulation mechanism is TBD (if
   necessary in this document).

6.5  Local Repair and Route Error (RERR) Messages

   If a link break occurs or a device fails during the delivery of data
   packets,  the upstream node of the link break MAY repair the route
   locally.  To repair a route, the node disseminates a RREQ with the
   originator address set to its own address and the destination address 
   set to the data packet's destination address.  In this case, the 'R 
   flag' of the RREQ is set to 1.  The data packet is buffered during the 
   route discovery period.  If the destination node receives the RREQ for 
   a route repair, it responds with a RREP of which the 'R flag' is also 
   set to 1.

   If the repairing node cannot receive a RREP from the final destination
   until the end of the route discovery period, it unicasts a RERR with 
   an error code that indicates the reason of the repair failure to the 
   originator.  A repairing node SHOULD NOT generate more than 
   RERR_RATELIMIT RERRs per second. Then, the buffered data packet is 
   discarded. If the originator that sends a data packet receives the 
   RERR, it MAY try to reinitiate route discovery.

   When the repairing node receives a RREP from the destination during 
   the route discovery period, it updates the routing table entry 
   information from the RREP.  Then the node transmits the buffered data
   packet to the destination through the new route.

7. Configuration Parameters

   This section describes the default values for some important
   parameters associated with LOAD operations.

   Parameter Name               Value
   ---------------------        -------------
   NET_TRAVERSAL_TIME           TBD
   RREQ_RETRIES                 3
   RREQ_RATELIMIT               2
   RERR_RATELIMIT               2


8.  IANA Consideration

   This document needs an additional IANA registry for the prot_type
   value that indicates the LOAD format.

9.  Security Considerations
   
   The security considerations of the [RFC3561] are applicable to this
   document. As described in the charter of the 6lowpan w.g., LOAD will
   also try to reuse existing security considerations related to Ad hoc
   routing protocols. Further considerations will be studied in the next
   version.

10.  Acknowledgments
