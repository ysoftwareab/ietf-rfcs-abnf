            Inter-domain SLA Exchange Implementation Report
                  draft-ietf-idr-sla-exchange-impl-00

Abstract

   This document is a report of implementations based on [IDR-SLA].
   [IDR-SLA] introduces a new BGP attribute to exchange QoS SLA
   parameters between BGP peers.  Current status of the implementation
   report covers Cisco implementation on 2 different OS, ExaBGP
   implementation and inter-operability results between them.

1.  Implementations and interoperability

                       Cisco IOS    Cisco NX-OS    ExaBGP
       Cisco IOS            Y             Y          Y
       Cisco NX-OS          Y             Y

       The ExaBGP implementation report is based on a version that is
       implemented as a receiver.

1.1.  Survey of Operations


    Optional transitive attribute:
        Is QoS attribute implemented as an optional transitive attribute
        - Yes



    Local QoS SLA policy enablement:
        When QoS SLA policy enablement triggers an explicit BGP update
            message with QoS attribute and SLA sub-type content, has an
            attribute's highest order bit, in the QoS attribute flag,
            set to 1? This is to indicate receiver to drop the message
            on reception.
        - Yes



    Is implementation capable of QoS SLA advertisement in the context
        of advertised NLRI? with source AS = 0 in the QoS SLA attribute
        - did not implement

    Is implementation capable of advertising QoS SLA with explicit
        source and destination AS encoded?
        - Yes,    Current ExaBGP version of implementation ignores
                  encoded AS



    First trigger for QoS SLA advertisement:
        At the first trigger for SLA advertisement, a sender advertises
            SLA parameters with an unique SLA id?
        - Yes

        Acting as a receiver, is implementation capable to learn an
            advertised QoS attribute and SLA parameters
        - Yes

Internet-Draft   IDR SLA Exchange Implementation Report         Aug 2015


    Updating previously advertised QoS SLA:
        On an event detecting update to earlier advertised SLA, sender
            picks the same SLA id, advertised before, and signals new
            SLA parameters in its entirety. No delta updates.
        - Yes

        Acting as a receiver, is implementation capable to replace SLA
            parameters learned previously?
        - Yes,    ExaBGP implementation validated to interpret received
                  SLA parameters. It is not implemented with persistent
                  state to map to next BGP update with the same SLA
                  identifier


    Invalidation of previously advertised SLA:
        On an event to invalidate previously advertised SLA parameters,
            a BGP update message is sent to the same destination AS with
            the same SLA id, advertised before, with SLA message
            containing 0 Traffic Class count.
        - Yes

        Acting as a receiver, is implementation capable to remove
            previously learned QoS SLA parameters?
        - Yes,    This capability not yet implemented in ExaBGP



    QoS SLA advertisement for point to point connection:
        Is implementation capable to advertise SLA for the destination
            that is next hop
        - Yes

    QoS SLA advertisement for destination multiple hops away:
        Is implementation capable to advertise SLA for the destination
            that is multiple hops away?
        - Yes

    None of the forwarding nodes modify the content of the QoS SLA
        parameters?
        - Yes



    Inter-operability with nodes not supporting this attribute:
        Is interoperability tested to make sure this optional transitive
            attribute is forwarded without any impact through the nodes
            that do not implement support of this attribute
        - Yes

    Attributes implemented:
        Cisco:
            Direction
                incoming
                outgoing
            Traffic Class Count
            Traffic Class Description
            Traffic Class Elements Count
            Classifier Element values
                ipDiffServCodePoint
            Traffic Class Service Count
            Service Attributes:
                Traffic_CLASS_TSPEC
                MINRATE_IN_PROFILE_MARKING
                MINRTE_OUT_PROFILE_MARKING
                RELATIVE_PRIORITY




2.  Suggestions for the future

   The proposed draft is to define message to exchange SLA parameters
   between two nodes.  The SLA specification does not make any
   assumption about provisioning.  It is not required though it would be
   nice if provisioning is aligned with SLA specification [IDR-SLA] and
   thus providing a consistent way of mapping between provisioning and
   messaging.


3.  Acknowledgements

   Thanks to Ruta Vaidya for providing data on Cisco implementation.
   Thanks To Thomas Mangin for his guidance during ExaBGP
   implementation.


4.  Security Considerations

   No Security considerations are required for the report presented in
   this document.
