<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>This document defines a Transport Subsystem, extending the Simple
      Network Management Protocol (SNMP) architecture defined in RFC 3411.
      This document defines a subsystem to contain Transport Models,
      comparable to other subsystems in the RFC3411 architecture. As work is
      being done to expand the transports to include secure transports such as
      SSH and TLS, using a subsystem will enable consistent design and
      modularity of such Transport Models. This document identifies and
      describes some key aspects that need to be considered for any Transport
      Model for SNMP.

The Internet-Standard Management Framework</h3>

<p>For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
        Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
        RFC 3410 <a class='info' href='#RFC3410'>[RFC3410]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Case, J., Mundy, R., Partain, D., and B. Stewart, &ldquo;Introduction and Applicability Statements for Internet-Standard Management Framework,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>.

<a name="rfc.section.1.2"></a><h3>1.2.&nbsp;
Conventions</h3>

<p>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 <a class='info' href='#RFC2119'>[RFC2119]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bradner, S., &ldquo;Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels,&rdquo; March&nbsp;1997.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>Non uppercased versions of the keywords should be read as in normal
        English. They will usually, but not always, be used in a context
        relating to compatibility with the RFC3411 architecture or the
        subsystem defined here, but which might have no impact on on-the-wire
        compatibility. These terms are used as guidance for designers of
        proposed IETF models to make the designs compatible with RFC3411
        subsystems and Abstract Service Interfaces (ASIs) (see section 3.2).
        Implementers are free to implement differently. Some usages of these
        lowercase terms are simply normal English usage.
</p>
<p>For consistency with SNMP-related specifications, this document
        favors terminology as defined in STD62 rather than favoring
        terminology that is consistent with non-SNMP specifications that use
        different variations of the same terminology. This is consistent with
        the IESG decision to not require the SNMPv3 terminology be modified to
        match the usage of other non-SNMP specifications when SNMPv3 was
        advanced to Full Standard.

Where this Extension Fits</h3>

<p>It is expected that readers of this document will have read RFC3410
        and RFC3411, and have a general understanding of the functionality
        defined in RFCs 3412-3418.
</p>
<p>The "Transport Subsystem" is an additional component for the SNMP
        Engine depicted in RFC3411, section 3.1.

<p>The transport mappings defined in RFC3417 do not provide
        lower-layer security functionality, and thus do not provide
        transport-specific security parameters. This document updates RFC3411
        and RFC3417 by defining an architectural extension and modifying the ASIs that
        transport mappings (hereafter called transport models) can use to pass transport-specific
        security parameters to other subsystems, including transport-specific
        security parameters that are translated into the transport-independent

<a name="rfc.section.2"></a><h3>2.&nbsp;
Motivation</h3>

<p>Just as there are multiple ways to secure one's home or business, in
      a continuum of alternatives, there are multiple ways to secure a network
      management protocol. Let's consider three general approaches.
</p>
<p>In the first approach, an individual could sit on his front porch
      waiting for intruders. In the second approach, he could hire an employee
      , schedule the employee, position the employee to guard what he wants
      protected, hire a second guard to cover if the first gets sick, and so
      on. In the third approach, he could hire a security company, tell them
      what he wants protected, and leave the details to them. Considerations
      of hiring and training employees, positioning and scheduling the guards, 
      arranging for cover, etc., are the responsibility of the security company. 
      The individual therefore achieves the desired security, with no significant 
      effort on his part other than identifying
requirements and verifying the quality of service being provided.
</p>
<p>The User-based Security Model (USM) as defined in <a class='info' href='#RFC3414'>[RFC3414]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Blumenthal, U. and B. Wijnen, &ldquo;User-based Security Model (USM) for version 3 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3),&rdquo; December&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> largely uses the first approach - it provides
      its own security. It utilizes existing mechanisms (e.g., SHA), but
      provides all the coordination. USM provides for the authentication of a
      principal, message encryption, data integrity checking, timeliness
      checking, etc.
</p>
<p>USM was designed to be independent of other existing security
      infrastructures. USM therefore requires a separate principal and key
      management infrastructure. Operators have reported that deploying
      another principal and key management infrastructure in order to use
      SNMPv3 is a deterrent to deploying SNMPv3. It is possible to use
      external mechanisms to handle the distribution of keys for use by USM.
      The more important issue is that operators wanted to leverage existing user base infrastructures that were not specific to SNMP.
</p>
<p>A USM-compliant architecture might combine the authentication
   mechanism with an external mechanism, such as RADIUS <a class='info' href='#RFC2865'>[RFC2865]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rigney, C., Willens, S., Rubens, A., and W. Simpson, &ldquo;Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS),&rdquo; June&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a>
   to provide the authentication service.  Similarly it might be
   possible to utilize an external protocol to encrypt a message,
   to check timeliness, to check data integrity, etc.  However this
   corresponds to the second approach - requiring the coordination
   of a number of differently subcontracted services.  Building solid
   security between the various services is difficult, and there is
   a significant potential for gaps in security.
</p>
<p>   An alternative approach might be to utilize one or more lower-layer
   security mechanisms to provide the message-oriented security
   services required.  These would include authentication of the
   sender, encryption, timeliness checking, and data integrity checking.
   This corresponds to the third approach described above.
   There are a number of IETF standards available or in development to address these
      problems through security layers at the transport layer or application
      layer, among them TLS <a class='info' href='#RFC5246'>[RFC5246]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Dierks, T. and E. Rescorla, &ldquo;The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>, SASL <a class='info' href='#RFC4422'>[RFC4422]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Melnikov, A. and K. Zeilenga, &ldquo;Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL),&rdquo; June&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>, and SSH <a class='info' href='#RFC4251'>[RFC4251]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ylonen, T. and C. Lonvick, &ldquo;The Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol Architecture,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>
</p>
<p>From an operational perspective, it is highly desirable to use
      security mechanisms that can unify the administrative security
      management for SNMPv3, command line interfaces (CLIs) and other
      management interfaces. The use of security services provided by lower
      layers is the approach commonly used for the CLI, and is also the
      approach being proposed for other network management protocols, 
      such as syslog <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-syslog-protocol'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;syslog&#8209;protocol]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Gerhards, R., &ldquo;The syslog Protocol,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> and NETCONF <a class='info' href='#RFC4741'>[RFC4741]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Enns, R., &ldquo;NETCONF Configuration Protocol,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>This document defines a Transport Subsystem extension to the RFC3411
      architecture based on the third approach. This extension specifies how
      other lower layer protocols with common security infrastructures can be
      used underneath the SNMP protocol and the desired goal of unified
      administrative security can be met.
</p>
<p>This extension allows security to be provided by an external protocol
      connected to the SNMP engine through an SNMP Transport Model <a class='info' href='#RFC3417'>[RFC3417]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Presuhn, R., &ldquo;Transport Mappings for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP),&rdquo; December&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>. Such a Transport Model would then enable the
      use of existing security mechanisms such as (TLS) <a class='info' href='#RFC5246'>[RFC5246]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Dierks, T. and E. Rescorla, &ldquo;The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> or SSH <a class='info' href='#RFC4251'>[RFC4251]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ylonen, T. and C. Lonvick, &ldquo;The Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol Architecture,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> within
      the RFC3411 architecture.
</p>
<p>There are a number of Internet security protocols and mechanisms that
      are in wide spread use. Many of them try to provide a generic
      infrastructure to be used by many different application layer protocols.
      The motivation behind the Transport Subsystem is to leverage these
      protocols where it seems useful.
</p>
<p>There are a number of challenges to be addressed to map the security
      provided by a secure transport into the SNMP architecture so that SNMP
      continues to provide interoperability with existing implementations.
      These challenges are described in detail in this document. For some key
      issues, design choices are described that might be made to provide a
      workable solution that meets operational requirements and fits into the
      SNMP architecture defined in <a class='info' href='#RFC3411'>[RFC3411]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Harrington, D., Presuhn, R., and B. Wijnen, &ldquo;An Architecture for Describing Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Management Frameworks,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>.

<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>modification of information
</li>
<li>masquerade

        of service or traffic analysis, but it should not make those threats
        significantly worse.

<a name="rfc.section.3.1.1"></a><h3>3.1.1.&nbsp;
Security Protocol Requirements</h3>

<p>There are a number of standard protocols that could be proposed
          as possible solutions within the Transport Subsystem. Some factors
          should be considered when selecting a protocol.
</p>
<p>Using a protocol in a manner for which it was not designed has
          numerous problems. The advertised security characteristics of a
          protocol might depend on it being used as designed; when used in
          other ways, it might not deliver the expected security
          characteristics. It is recommended that any proposed model include a
          description of the applicability of the Transport Model.
</p>
<p>A Transport Model SHOULD NOT require modifications to the
          underlying protocol. Modifying the protocol might change its
          security characteristics in ways that could impact other existing
          usages. If a change is necessary, the change SHOULD be an extension
          that has no impact on the existing usages. Any Transport Model
          SHOULD include a description of potential impact on other usages of
          the protocol.
</p>
<p>Since multiple transport models can exist simultaneously within the transport subsystem, transport models MUST be able to coexist with each other.

<a name="rfc.section.3.2.1"></a><h3>3.2.1.&nbsp;
Architectural Modularity Requirements</h3>

<p>SNMP version 3 (SNMPv3) is based on a modular architecture
          (defined in <a class='info' href='#RFC3411'>[RFC3411]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Harrington, D., Presuhn, R., and B. Wijnen, &ldquo;An Architecture for Describing Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Management Frameworks,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> section 3) to allow the
          evolution of the SNMP protocol standards over time, and to minimize
          side effects between subsystems when changes are made.
</p>
<p>The RFC3411 architecture includes a Message
          Processing Subsystem permitting different message versions to be
          handled by a single engine, a Security Subsystem for
          enabling different methods of providing security services,  Applications(s) to support different
          types of application processors, and an Access Control Subsystem for
          allowing multiple approaches to access control. The RFC3411
          architecture does not include a subsystem for Transport Models,
          despite the fact there are multiple transport mappings already
          defined for SNMP. This document describes a Transport
          Subsystem that is compatible with the RFC3411 architecture. As work is being
          done to use secure transports such as SSH
          and TLS, using a subsystem will enable consistent design and
          modularity of such Transport Models.
</p>
<p>The design of this Transport Subsystem accepts the goals of the
          RFC3411 architecture defined in section 1.5 of <a class='info' href='#RFC3411'>[RFC3411]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Harrington, D., Presuhn, R., and B. Wijnen, &ldquo;An Architecture for Describing Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Management Frameworks,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>. This Transport Subsystem uses a modular
          design that permits Transport Models (which may or may not 
          be security-aware) to be "plugged into" the RFC3411 architecture .  Such 
          Transport Models would be independent of other modular SNMP 
          components as much as possible.  This design also permits Transport 
          Models to be advanced through the standards process independently 
          of other Transport Models.
</p>
<p>To encourage a basic level of interoperability, any Transport
   Model SHOULD define one mandatory-to-implement security mechanism, but
   should also be able to support additional existing and new mechanisms.
   
</p>
<p>The following diagram depicts the SNMPv3 architecture
            including the new Transport Subsystem defined in this document,
            and a new Transport Security Model defined in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-isms-transport-security-model'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;isms&#8209;transport&#8209;security&#8209;model]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Harrington, D. and W.

Changes to the RFC3411 Architecture</h3>

<p>The RFC3411 architecture and the Security Subsystem assume that a
          Security Model is called by a Message Processing Model and will
          perform multiple security functions within the Security Subsystem. A
          Transport Model that supports a secure transport protocol might
          perform similar security functions within the Transport Subsystem, including the translation of transport security
          parameters to/from security-model-independent parameters.
</p>
<p>To accommodate this, an implementation-specific cache of
          transport-specific information will be described (not shown), and
          the data flows on this path will be extended to pass
          security-model-independent values. This document amends some of the ASIs defined in RFC 3411, and these
   changes are covered in section 6.
</p>
<p>New Security Models may be defined that understand how to work
   with these modified ASIs and the transport-information cache.
   One such Security Model, the Transport Security Model, is defined
   in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-isms-transport-security-model'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;isms&#8209;transport&#8209;security&#8209;model]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Harrington, D. and W. Hardaker, &ldquo;Transport Security Model for SNMP,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>.

Changes to RFC3411 processing</h3>

<p>     The introduction of secure transports affects the
   responsibilities and order of processing within the RFC3411
   architecture.  While the steps are the same, they may occur in a
   different order, and may be done by different subsystems.  With
   the existing RFC3411 architecture, security processing starts when
   the Message Processing Model decodes portions of the encoded message
   to extract parameters that identify which Security Model should
   handle the security-related tasks.
</p>
<p>   A secure transport performs those security functions on the message,
   before the message is decoded.  Some of these functions
   might then be repeated by the selected Security Model.

Passing Information between SNMP Engines</h3>

<p>A secure Transport Model will establish an authenticated and possibly encrypted tunnel between the Transport Models of two SNMP engines.
            After a transport layer tunnel is established, then SNMP messages
            can be sent through the tunnel from one SNMP engine to the other. 
            Transport Models MAY support sending multiple SNMP
            messages through the same tunnel.

Access Control Requirements</h3>

securityName and securityLevel Mapping</h3>

<p>SNMP data access controls are expected to work on the basis of
            who can perform what operations on which subsets of data, and
            based on the security services that will be provided to secure the
            data in transit. The securityModel and securityLevel parameters
            establish the protections for transit - whether authentication and
            privacy services will be or have been applied to the message. The
            securityName is a model-independent identifier of the security
            "principal".
</p>
<p>A Security Model plays a role in security that goes beyond
            protecting the message - it provides a mapping between the
            security-model-specific principal for an incoming message to a
            security-model independent securityName which can be used for
            subsequent processing, such as for access control. The
            securityName is mapped from a mechanism-specific identity, and
            this mapping must be done for incoming messages by the Security
            Model before it passes securityName to the Message Processing
            Model via the processIncoming ASI.
</p>
<p>A Security Model is also responsible to specify, via the
            securityLevel parameter, whether incoming messages have been
            authenticated and encrypted, and to ensure that outgoing
            messages are authenticated and encrypted based on the value of
            securityLevel.
</p>
<p>A Transport Model MAY provide suggested values for securityName 
            and securityLevel. A Security Model may have multiple sources for determining the 
            principal and desired security services, and a particular Security Model may or
            may not utilize the values proposed by a Transport Model when 
            deciding the value of securityName and securityLevel.
</p>
<p>Documents defining a new transport domain MUST define a prefix 
            that MAY be prepended by the Security Model to all passed securityNames. 
            The prefix MUST include from one to four ASCII characters, not including a 
            &quot;:&quot; 
            (ASCII 0x3a) character. If a prefix is used, a securityName is constructed 
            by concatenating the prefix and a &quot;:&quot; (ASCII 0x3a) character 
            followed by a non-empty identity in an snmpAdminString compatible format.  
            Transport domains and their corresponding prefixes are coordinated via the 
            IANA registry "SNMP Transport Domains".

Security Parameter Passing Requirements</h3>

<p>A Message Processing Model might unpack SNMP-specific security
          parameters from an incoming message before calling a specific
          Security Model to handle the security-related processing of the
   message. When using a secure Transport Model, some security
   parameters might be extracted from the transport layer by the
   Transport Model before the message is passed to the Message Processing
   Subsystem.
</p>
<p>This document describes a cache mechanism (see Section 5), into
          which the Transport Model puts information about the transport and
          security parameters applied to a transport connection or an incoming
          message, and a Security Model may extract that information from the
          cache. A tmStateReference is passed as an extra parameter in the
          ASIs between the Transport Subsystem, the Message Processing and
          Security Subsystems, to identify the relevant cache. This approach
          of passing a model-independent reference is consistent with the
          securityStateReference cache already being passed around in the
          RFC3411 ASIs.

<a name="rfc.section.3.2.4"></a><h3>3.2.4.&nbsp;
Separation of Authentication and Authorization</h3>

<p>The RFC3411 architecture defines a separation of authentication
          and the authorization to access and/or modify MIB data. A set of
          model-independent parameters (securityModel, securityName, and
          securityLevel) are passed between the Security Subsystem, the
          applications, and the Access Control Subsystem.
</p>
<p>   This separation was a deliberate decision of the SNMPv3 WG, to allow
   support for authentication protocols which do not provide data access
   authorization capabilities, and to support data access authorization
   schemes, such as VACM, that do not perform their own authentication.
</p>
<p>A Message Processing Model determines which Security Model is
          used, either based on the message version, e.g., SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c,
          or possibly by a value specified in the message, e.g., msgSecurityModel
   field in SNMPv3.
</p>
<p>The Security Model makes the decision which securityName and
          securityLevel values are passed as model-independent parameters to
          an application, which then passes them via the isAccessAllowed ASI
          to the Access Control Subsystem.
</p>
<p>An Access Control Model performs the mapping from the
          model-independent security parameters to a policy within the Access
          Control Model that is access-control-model-dependent.
</p>
<p>
     A Transport Model does not know which Security Model will be used
   for an incoming message, so cannot know how the securityName and
   securityLevel parameters will be determined.  It can propose an
   authenticated identity (via the tmSecurityName field), but there
   is no guarantee that this value will be used by the Security Model.
   For example, non-transport-aware Security Models will typically
   determine the securityName (and securityLevel) based on the contents
   of the SNMP message itself.  Such Security Models will simply not
   know that the tmStateReference cache exists.
</p>
<p>Further, even if the Transport Model can influence the choice of
   securityName, it cannot directly determine the authorization allowed
   to this identity.  If two different Transport Models each authenticate
   a transport principal, that are then both mapped to the same
   securityName, then these two identities will typically be afforded
   exactly the same authorization by the Access Control Model.
   
</p>
<p>   The only way for the Access Control Model to differentiate between
   identities based on the underlying Transport Model, would be for
   such transport-authenticated identities to be mapped to distinct
   securityNames.  How and if this is done is Security-Model-dependent.

Session Requirements</h3>

<p>Some secure transports have a notion of sessions, while other
        secure transports provide channels or other session-like
        mechanism. Throughout this document, the term session is used in a
        broad sense to cover transport sessions, transport channels, and other transport-layer session-like mechanisms. Transport-layer sessions that can secure multiple SNMP messages within the lifetime of
        the session are considered desirable because the
        cost of authentication can be amortized over potentially many
        transactions. How a transport session is actually established, opened, closed,
        or maintained is specific to a particular Transport Model.
</p>
<p>To reduce redundancy, this document describes aspects that are
        expected to be common to all Transport Model sessions.

No SNMP Sessions</h3>

<p>The architecture defined in <a class='info' href='#RFC3411'>[RFC3411]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Harrington, D., Presuhn, R., and B. Wijnen, &ldquo;An Architecture for Describing Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Management Frameworks,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> and the Transport Subsystem defined in this document do not support SNMP sessions or include a session selector in the Abstract Service Interfaces.  
</p>
<p>The Transport Subsystem may support transport sessions. However, the transport subsystem does not have access to the pduType, so cannot select a given transport session for particular types of traffic.
</p>
<p> Certain parameters of these ASIs might be used to guide the selection of an appropriate transport session to use for a given request by an application.
</p>
<p>The transportDomain and transportAddress identify the transport connection
        to a remote network node. Elements of the transport
   address (such as the port number) might be used by an application to send a particular PDU type to a  particular transport address.
</p>
<p>The securityName identifies which security principal to communicate
   with at that address (e.g., different NMS applications), and the
   securityLevel might permit selection of different sets of
   security properties for different purposes (e.g., encrypted SETs vs.
   non-encrypted GETs).
</p>
<p>  However, because the handling of transport sessions is specific to each transport model, some transport models MAY restrict selecting a particular transport session. 
</p>
<p>An application might use a unique combination of transportDomain, transportAddress, securityModel, securityName, and securityLevel to try to force the selection of a given transport session. This usage is NOT RECOMMENDED because it is not guaranteed to be interoperable across implementatioins and across models.
</p>
<p>Implementations SHOULD be able to maintain some reasonable number of concurrent transport sessions, and MAY provide non-standard internal mechanisms to select transport sessions.

Session Establishment Requirements</h3>

</p>
<p>Transport session establishment might require provisioning

          and the implementation.

Session Maintenance Requirements</h3>

<p>A Transport Model can tear down sessions as needed. It might be

          result of resource constraints, for example.
</p>
<p>The decision to tear down a session is implementation-dependent.
          How an implementation determines that an operation has completed is implementation-dependent. While it is possible to tear down each transport session 
          after processing for each message has completed, this is not
          recommended for performance reasons. 
</p>
<p>The elements of procedure describe when cached information can be
          discarded, and the timing of cache cleanup
          might have security implications, but cache memory management is an
          implementation issue.
</p>
<p>If a Transport Model defines MIB module objects to maintain
          session state information, then the Transport Model MUST define what
          SHOULD happen to the objects when a related session is torn down,

Message security versus session security</h3>

<p>A Transport Model session is associated with state information
          that is maintained for its lifetime. This state information allows
          for the application of various security services to multiple
          messages. Cryptographic keys associated with the transport session
          SHOULD be used to provide authentication, integrity checking, and
          encryption services, as needed, for data that is communicated during
          the session. The cryptographic protocols used to establish keys for
          a Transport Model session SHOULD ensure that fresh new session keys
          are generated for each session.  This would ensure that a cross-session replay attack
   would be unsuccessful; that is, an attacker could not take a message
   observed on one session, and successfully replay this on another
   session.
</p>
<p>A good security protocol would also protect against replay attacks
   within a session; that is, an attacker could not take a message
   observed on a session, and successfully replay this later in the
   same session.   One approach would be to use sequence information
   within the protocol, allowing the participants to detect if messages
   were replayed or reordered within a session.
</p>
<p>If a secure transport session is closed between the time
   a request message is received, and the corresponding response message
   is sent, then the response message SHOULD be discarded, even if a
   new session has been established.  The SNMPv3 WG decided that this
   should be a SHOULD architecturally, and it is a security-model-specific
   decision whether to REQUIRE this.
</p>
<p>SNMPv3 was designed to support multiple levels of security,
   selectable on a per-message basis by an SNMP application, because,
   for example, there is not much value in using encryption for a
   Commander Generator to poll for potentially non-sensitive performance
   data on thousands of interfaces every ten minutes; the encryption
   might add significant overhead to processing of the messages.
</p>
<p>Some Transport Models might support only specific authentication
          and encryption services, such as requiring all messages to be
          carried using both authentication and encryption, regardless of the
          security level requested by an SNMP application. A Transport Model
          MAY upgrade the security level requested by a transport-aware security 
          model, i.e. noAuthNoPriv and authNoPriv might be sent over an authenticated 
          and encrypted session. A Transport Model MUST NOT downgrade the security 
          level requested by a transport-aware security model, and SHOULD discard any
          message where this would occur.

Scenario Diagrams and the Transport Subsystem</h3>

<p>RFC3411 section 4.6.1 and 4.6.2 provide scenario diagrams to

      Request Message to Network", "Receive SNMP Response Message from
      Network", "Receive SNMP Message from Network" and "Send SNMP message 
      to Network" arrows in these diagrams.
</p>
<p>This document defines two ASIs corresponding to these arrows: a 
      sendMessage ASI to send SNMP messages to the

      messages from the network. These ASIs are used for all SNMP messages,

Cached Information and References</h3>

<p>When performing SNMP processing, there are two levels of state
   information that may need to be retained:  the immediate state
   linking a request-response pair, and potentially longer-term state
   relating to transport and security.
</p>
<p>The RFC3411 architecture uses caches to maintain the short-term
   message state, and uses references in the ASIs to pass this
   information between subsystems.
</p>
<p>This document defines the requirements for a cache to handle additional short-term message state and longer-term transport state information, using a tmStateReference
   parameter to pass this information between subsystems.
</p>
<p>To simplify the elements of
      procedure, the release of state information is not always explicitly
      specified. As a general rule, if state information is available when a
      message being processed gets discarded, the state related to that
      message SHOULD also be discarded. If state information is available
      when a relationship between engines is severed, such as the closing of a
      transport session, the state information for that relationship SHOULD
      also be discarded.
</p>
<p>Since the contents of a cache are meaningful only within an
        implementation, and not on-the-wire, the format of the cache is 
        implementation-specific.

securityStateReference</h3>

<p>The securityStateReference parameter is defined in RFC3411.  Its
   primary purpose is to provide a mapping between a request and the

   Models, and an entry is typically only retained for the lifetime of
   a request-response pair of messages.

tmStateReference</h3>

<p>For each transport session, information about the transport security
   is stored in a tmState cache or datastore, that is referenced by a tmStateReference.  The tmStateReference parameter is used to pass model-specific and mechanism-specific parameters between the Transport subsystem and transport-aware Security Models.
</p>
<p>In general, when necessary, the tmState is populated by the security model for outgoing messages and by the transport model for incoming messages. However, in both cases, the model populating the tmState may have incomplete information, and the missing information might be populated by the other model when the information becomes available.
</p>
<p>The tmState might contain both long-term and short-term information. The session information typically remains valid for the duration of the transport session, might be used for several messages, and might be stored in a local configuration datastore. Some information has a shorter lifespan, such as tmSameSecurity and tmRequestedSecurityLevel which are associated with a specific message.
</p>
<p>Since this cache is only used within an implementation, and not
   on-the-wire, the precise contents and format of the cache are implementation-dependent.  For architectural modularity between Transport Models and transport-aware Security Models, a fully-defined tmState MUST conceptually include at least the following fields:

<blockquote class="text">

</p>
<p>A transport-aware Security Model might wish to take account of the
   transport protocol and originating address when authenticating the
   request, and setting up the authorization parameters.  It is therefore

<li>tmSecurityName:
         a human-readable name (in snmpAdminString format)
         representing this transport identity.  This value is
         transport- and implementation-specific, and is only
         used (directly) by the Transport and Security Models.

</li>
<li>securityName:
         a human-readable name (in snmpAdminString format) representing
         the SNMP principal in a model-independent manner. This value is used directly by SNMP Applications, the access control subsystem, the message processing subsystem, and the security subsystem. 

</li>
</ul>

<p>The transport principal may or may not be the same as
   the tmSecurityName.  Similarly, the tmSecurityName may or may not
   be the same as the securityName as seen by the Application and
   Access Control subsystems.   In particular, a non-transport-aware
   Security Model will ignore tmSecurityName completely when determining
   the SNMP securityName.

</p>
<p>However it is important that the mapping between the transport
   principal and the SNMP securityName (for transport-aware Security
   Models) is consistent and predictable, to allow configuration of
   suitable access control and the establishment of transport connections.

securityLevel</h3>

<p>There are two distinct issues relating to security level as
   applied to secure transports.  For clarity, these are handled
   by separate fields in the tmStateReference cache:

</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>tmTransportSecurityLevel:
         an indication from the Transport Model of the level of
         security offered by this session.  The Security Model
         can use this to ensure that incoming messages were
         suitably protected before acting on them.

</li>
<li>tmRequestedSecurityLevel:
         an indication from the Security Model of the level
         of security required to be provided by the transport
         protocol.   The Transport Model can use this to
         ensure that outgoing messages will not be sent over
         an insufficiently secure session.

</li>
</ul>

<a name="rfc.section.5.2.4"></a><h3>5.2.4.&nbsp;
Session Information</h3>

<p>For security reasons, if a secure transport session is closed
   between the time a request message is received and the corresponding
   response message is sent, then the response message SHOULD be
   discarded, even if a new session has been established.  The SNMPv3
   WG decided that this should be a SHOULD architecturally, and it is
   a security-model-specific decision whether to REQUIRE this.

</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>tmSameSecurity:
        this flag is used by a transport-aware Security Model
        to indicate whether the Transport Model MUST enforce
        this restriction.
</li>
<li>tmSessionID:
        in order to verify whether the session has changed, the
        Transport Model must be able to compare the session used
        to receive the original request with the one to be used
        to send the response.  This typically requires some form
        of session identifier.  This value is only ever used by
        the Transport Model, so the format and interpretation of
        this field are model-specific and implementation-dependent.

</li>
</ul>

<p>When processing an outgoing message, if tmSameSecurity
        is true, then the tmSessionID MUST match the current transport session, 
        otherwise the message MUST be discarded, and the dispatcher 
        notified that sending the message failed.

Abstract Service Interfaces</h3>

<p>Abstract service interfaces have been defined by RFC 3411 to describe
      the conceptual data flows between the various subsystems within an SNMP
      entity, and to help keep the subsystems independent of each other except
      for the common parameters.
</p>
<p>     This document introduces a couple of new ASIs to define the interface
   between the Transport and Dispatcher Subsystems,  and extends some of
   the ASIs defined in RFC3411 to include transport-related information.
</p>
<p>This document follows the example of RFC3411 regarding the release of
      state information, and regarding error indications.
</p>
<p>1) The release of state information is not always explicitly
      specified in a transport model. As a general rule, if state information
      is available when a message gets discarded, the message-state
      information should also be released, and if state information is
      available when a session is closed, the session state information should
      also be released. Keeping sensitive security information
      longer than necessary might introduce potential vulnerabilities to an
      implementation.
</p>
<p>2)An error indication in statusInformation will typically include the
   OID and value for an incremented error counter.  This may be accompanied
   by values for contextEngineID and contextName for this counter, a value
   for securityLevel, and the appropriate state reference if the information
   is available at the point where the error is detected.

sendMessage ASI</h3>

<p>The sendMessage ASI is used to pass a message from the Dispatcher
        to the appropriate Transport Model for sending. In the diagram in section 4.6.1 of RFC 3411, the sendMessage ASI
        defined in this document replaces the text "Send SNMP Request Message to Network". In section
        4.6.2, the sendMessage ASI replaces the text "Send SNMP Message to
        Network"

<p>If present and valid, the tmStateReference refers to a cache
        containing transport-model-specific parameters for the transport and

        implementation-dependent. How the information in the cache is used is

<p>This may sound underspecified, but a transport model might be

Security Considerations</h3>

<p>This document defines an architectural approach that permits SNMP to
      utilize transport layer security services. Each proposed Transport Model
      should discuss the security considerations of that Transport Model.
</p>
<p>It is considered desirable by some industry segments that SNMP
      Transport Models should utilize transport layer security that addresses
      perfect forward secrecy at least for encryption keys. Perfect forward
      secrecy guarantees that compromise of long term secret keys does not
      result in disclosure of past session keys. Each proposed Transport Model
      should include a discussion in its security considerations of whether
      perfect forward security is appropriate for that Transport Model.
</p>
<p>The Denial of Service characteristics of various transport models and 
      security protocols will vary and should be evaluated when determining
      the applicability of a transport model to a particular deployment situation.
</p>
<p>Since the cache will contain security-related parameters,
      implementers should store this information (in memory or in persistent
      storage) in a manner to protect it from unauthorized disclosure and/or
      modification.
</p>
<p>Care must be taken to ensure that a SNMP engine is sending packets
      out over a transport using credentials that are legal for that engine to
      use on behalf of that user. Otherwise an engine that has multiple
      transports open might be "tricked" into sending a message through the
      wrong transport.
</p>
<p>A Security Model may have multiple sources from which to define the
      securityName and securityLevel. The use of a secure Transport Model does
      not imply that the securityName and securityLevel chosen by the Security
      Model represent the transport-authenticated identity or the
      transport-provided security services. The securityModel, securityName,
      and securityLevel parameters are a related set, and an administrator
      should understand how the specified securityModel selects the
      corresponding securityName and securityLevel.

Coexistence, Security Parameters, and Access Control</h3>

<p>In the RFC3411 architecture, the Message Processing Model makes the
        decision about which Security Model to use. The architectural change
        described by this document does not alter that.
</p>
<p>The architecture change described by this document does however,
        allow SNMP to support two different approaches to security -
        message-driven security and transport-driven security. With
        message-driven security, SNMP provides its own security, and passes
        security parameters within the SNMP message; with transport-driven
        security, SNMP depends on an external entity to provide security
        during transport by "wrapping" the SNMP message.
</p>
<p>In times of network stress, the security protocol and its
            underlying security mechanisms SHOULD NOT depend upon the
            ready availability of other network services (e.g., Network Time
            Protocol (NTP) or Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting
            (AAA) protocols or certificate authorities). The User-based Security 
            Model was explicitly designed to not depend upon external network 
            services, and provides its own security services. It is RECOMMENDED 
            that operators provision authPriv USM to supplement any security model 
            or transport model that has external dependencies, so that secure SNMP 
            communications can continue when the external network service is not 
            available.
</p>
<p>Using a non-transport-aware security model with a secure transport 
            model is NOT RECOMMENDED, for the following reasons.
</p>
<p>Security models defined before the Transport Security Model (i.e.,
        SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, and USM) do not support transport-based security, and
        only have access to the security parameters contained within the SNMP
        message. They do not know about the security parameters associated
        with a secure transport. As a result, the Access Control Subsystem
        bases its decisions on the security parameters extracted from the SNMP
        message, not on transport-based security parameters.
</p>
<p>Implications of combining older security models with secure
        transport models are known. The securityName used for access control
        decisions is based on the message-driven identity, which might be 
        unauthenticated, not the transport-driven authenticated identity:
        
        </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>An SNMPv1 message will always be paired with an SNMPv1 Security
            Model (per RFC3584), regardless of the transport mapping or
            transport model used, and access controls will be based on the
            unauthenticated community name.
</li>
<li>An SNMPv2c message will always be paired with an SNMPv2c
            Security Model (per RFC3584), regardless of the transport mapping
            or transport model used, and access controls will be based on the
            unauthenticated community name.
</li>
<li>An SNMPv3 message will always be paired with the securityModel
            specified in the msgSecurityParameters field of the message (per
            RFC3412), regardless of the transport mapping or transport model
            used. If the SNMPv3 message specifies the User-based Security
            Model (USM), with noAuthNoPriv, then the access controls will be 
            based on the unauthenticated USM user.
</li>
<li>For outgoing messages, if a secure transport model is selected
            in combination with a security model that does not populate a tmStateReference, 
            the secure transport model SHOULD detect the lack of a valid 
            tmStateReference and fail.

IANA Considerations</h3>

<p>IANA is requested to create a new registry in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Number Spaces. The new registry should be called "SNMP Transport Domains".

Why tmStateReference?</h3>

<p>This appendix considers why a cache-based approach was selected for
      passing parameters.
</p>
<p>There are four approaches that could be used for passing information
      between the Transport Model and a Security Model.
</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>one could define an ASI to supplement the existing ASIs, or
</li>
<li>one could add a header to encapsulate the SNMP message,
</li>
<li>one could utilize fields already defined in the existing SNMPv3
          message, or
</li>
<li>one could pass the information in an implementation-specific
          cache or via a MIB module.

<a name="rfc.section.A.1"></a><h3>A.1.&nbsp;
Define an Abstract Service Interface</h3>

<p>Abstract Service Interfaces (ASIs) are defined by a set of
        primitives that specify the services provided and the abstract data
        elements that are to be passed when the services are invoked. Defining
        additional ASIs to pass the security and transport information from
        the Transport Subsystem to Security Subsystem has the advantage of
        being consistent with existing RFC3411/3412 practice, and helps to
        ensure that any Transport Model proposals pass the necessary data, and
        do not cause side effects by creating model-specific dependencies
        between itself and other models or other subsystems other than those
        that are clearly defined by an ASI.

<a name="rfc.section.A.2"></a><h3>A.2.&nbsp;
Using an Encapsulating Header</h3>

<p>A header could encapsulate the SNMP message to pass necessary
        information from the Transport Model to the dispatcher and then to a
        Message Processing Model. The message header would be included in the
        wholeMessage ASI parameter, and would be removed by a corresponding
        Message Processing Model. This would imply the (one and only)
        messaging dispatcher would need to be modified to determine which SNMP
        message version was involved, and a new Message Processing Model would
        need to be developed that knew how to extract the header from the
        message and pass it to the Security Model.

<a name="rfc.section.A.3"></a><h3>A.3.&nbsp;
Modifying Existing Fields in an SNMP Message</h3>

<p><a class='info' href='#RFC3412'>[RFC3412]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Case, J., Harrington, D., Presuhn, R., and B. Wijnen, &ldquo;Message Processing and Dispatching for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP),&rdquo; December&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> defines the SNMPv3 message, which
        contains fields to pass security related parameters. The Transport
        Subsystem could use these fields in an SNMPv3 message, or comparable
        fields in other message formats to pass information between Transport
        Models in different SNMP engines, and to pass information between a
        Transport Model and a corresponding Message Processing Model.
</p>
<p>If the fields in an incoming SNMPv3 message are changed by the
        Transport Model before passing it to the Security Model, then the
        Transport Model will need to decode the ASN.1 message, modify the
        fields, and re-encode the message in ASN.1 before passing the message
        on to the message dispatcher or to the transport layer. This would
        require an intimate knowledge of the message format and message
        versions so the Transport Model knew which fields could be modified.
        This would seriously violate the modularity of the architecture.

<a name="rfc.section.A.4"></a><h3>A.4.&nbsp;
Using a Cache</h3>

<p>This document describes a cache, into which the Transport Model
        puts information about the security applied to an incoming message,
        and a Security Model can extract that information from the cache.
        Given that there might be multiple TM-security caches, a
        tmStateReference is passed as an extra parameter in the ASIs between
        the Transport Subsystem and the Security Subsystem, so the Security
        Model knows which cache of information to consult.
</p>
<p>This approach does create dependencies between a specific Transport
        Model and a corresponding specific Security Model. However, the
        approach of passing a model-independent reference to a model-dependent
        cache is consistent with the securityStateReference already being
        passed around in the RFC3411 ASIs.
