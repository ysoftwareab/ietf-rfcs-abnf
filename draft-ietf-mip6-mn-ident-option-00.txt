Internet-Draft    MN Identifier Option for Mobile IPv6     December 2004


1.  Introduction

    The base specification of Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775] identifies mobility
    entities using an IPv6 address.  A mechanism is needed where in
    mobility entities can be identified using other identifiers (for
    example, a network access identifier (NAI) [RFC2486], International
    Mobile Station Identifier (IMSI), an application/deployment specific
    opaque identifier etc).  Using other identities for a mobile node
    (MN) permits various applicabilities, e.g.  authentication using
    existing infrastructure (AAA (Authentication, Authorization and
    Accounting), HLR/AuC (Home Location Register/Authentication Center)),
    dynamic allocation of a mobility anchor point, dynamic allocation of
    an address etc.

    This document defines an option with subtype number which identify a
    specific type of identifier.  One instance of subtype, the NAI is
    defined in Section 3.1.  It is expected that other types of
    identifiers will be defined by other documents in the future.

3.  MN Identifier option

    This section defines the Mobile Node Identifier option.  Various
    forms of identifiers can be used to identify a MN.  Some examples
    include a Network Access Identifier (NAI) [RFC2486], an opaque
    identifier applicable to a particular application, etc.  The sub-type
    field in the option defines the specific type of identifier.

    This option can be used in mobility messages containing a mobility
    header.  The subtype field in the option is used to interpret the
    specific type of identifier.

        |  Subtype      |          Identifier ...
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


       Option Type:

          MN-ID-OPTION-TYPE to be defined by IANA.  An 8-bit identifier
          of the type mobility option.

       Option Length:

          8-bit unsigned integer, representing the length in octets of
          the Subtype and Identifier fields.

       Subtype:

          Subtype field defines the specific type of identifier included
          in the identifier field.

       Identifier:

          A variable length identifier of type as specified by the
          subtype field of this option.

       Alignment requirements:

          This option does not have any alignment requirements.

3.1  MN-NAI mobility option

    The format of the MN-NAI mobility option is as defined in Section 3.
    This option uses the subtype value of 1.  The MN-NAI mobility option
    is used to identify the mobile node.

    The MN-NAI mobility option uses an identifier of the form user@realm
    [RFC2486].

3.2  Processing Considerations

    When present, this option MUST appear before any authentication
    enabling extension in a message containing a mobility header.  Also,
    if this option is present in the first Binding Update used to create
    a binding cache entry at the Home Agent, it MUST be present in all
    subsequent Binding Updates used to renew the binding cache entry.  If
    this option is present in the Binding Update, it MUST be included in
    the corresponding reply (Binding Acknowledgement).

4.  Security Considerations

    None.  This document defines new identifiers for a mobile node and
    does not introduce new security threats.

5.  IANA Considerations

    IANA services are required for this document.  The values for new
    mobility options must be assigned from the Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775]
    numbering space.

    The values for Mobility Option types MN-ID-OPTION-TYPE as defined in
    Section 3 need to be assigned.  The suggested value is 7 for the
    MN-ID-OPTION-TYPE.

    IANA should record value for this new Mobility Option.
