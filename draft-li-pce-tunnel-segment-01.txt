                   PCEP Extensions for Tunnel Segment
                     draft-li-pce-tunnel-segment-01

Abstract

   [I-D.li-spring-tunnel-segment] introduces a new type of segment,
   Tunnel Segment, for the segment routing.  Tunnel segment can be used
   to reduce SID stack depth of SR path, span the non-SR domain or
   provide differentiated services.  A binding label can be assigned to
   tunnel segment.  An upstream node can use such a binding label for
   steering traffic into the appropriate tunnel.  This document
   specifies a set of extensions to PCEP to support that PCC reports
   binding label of tunnel to PCE and that PCE allocates label for
   tunnel and updates label binding of tunnel to PCC.

1.  Introduction

   [I-D.li-spring-tunnel-segment] introduces a new type of segment,
   Tunnel Segment, for the segment routing.  Tunnel segment can be used
   to reduce SID stack depth of SR path, span the non-SR domain or
   provide differentiated services.  A binding label can be assigned to
   tunnel segment.  An upstream node can use such a binding label for
   steering traffic into the appropriate tunnel.  The tunnel segment can
   be allocated for RSVP-TE tunnel, SR-TE tunnel or IP tunnel.

   [I-D.li-spring-tunnel-segment] defines the requirement of control
   plane to support use cases of tunnel segment.  The PCE related
   requirements are as follows:

Internet-Draft     PCEP Extensions for Tunnel Segment         March 2016


   -- PCEP extensions SHOULD be introduced to advertise the binding
   relationship between a SID/label and the corresponding tunnel from a
   PCC to a PCE.  Attributes of the tunnel MAY be carried optionally.

   -- PCE SHOULD support to allocate SID/label for the corresponding
   tunnel dynamically.

   -- PCEP extensions SHOULD be introduced to distribute the binding
   relationship between a SID/label and the corresponding tunnel from a
   PCE to a PCC.  Attributes of the tunnel MAY be carried optionally.

   This document specifies the protocol extensions to PCEP to support
   these requirements defined in [I-D.li-spring-tunnel-segment].

2.  Terminology

   SR: Segment Routing

   SR-TE: Segment Routing Traffic Engineering

   SR-TE Tunnel: Segment Routing Traffic Engineering Tunnel

   This document uses the terms defined in [RFC5440]: PCC, PCE, PCEP
   Peer.

   The following terms are defined in [I-D.ietf-pce-pce-initiated-lsp]:

   PCE-initiated LSP: LSP that is instantiated as a result of a request
   from the PCE.

   The following terms are defined in
   [I-D.chen-pce-pce-initiated-ip-tunnel]:

   IP Tunnel: Tunnel that uses IP encapsulation.

   PCE-initiated IP Tunnel: IP Tunnel that is instantiated as a result
   of a request from the PCE.

3.  Procedures

3.1.  Procedure for PCC Reporting Label Binding

   In the procedure for PCC reporting the label binding PCC allocates
   the label and reports the label binding for the tunnel according to
   the local policy PCC.  For report the label binding information,
   there are following options:

Internet-Draft     PCEP Extensions for Tunnel Segment         March 2016


   Option 1: [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller] specifies
   the procedures and PCEP protocol extensions for using the PCE as the
   central controller where LSPs are calculated/setup/initiated and
   label forwarding entries are downloaded to PCC.  It introduces the
   LABEL object to specify the label binding information in PCLabelUpd
   message.  The label carried in LABEL object is mapped to specific LSP
   carried in LSP object or FEC carried in FEC object.  The LABEL object
   defined in the document is to allocate label from the PCE to PCC and
   is not appropriate to represent the label binding for the tunnel
   which can be carried in other PCE objects.

   Option 2: [I-D.sivabalan-pce-binding-label-sid] proposes an approach
   for reporting binding label/SID to Path Computation Element (PCE) for
   supporting PCE-based Traffic Engineering policies.  It introduces the
   optional TLV called "TE-PATH-BINDING TLV" to carry binding label or
   SID for a TE path.  This TLV is limited to traffic engineering and
   not appropriate for tunnel segment.

   Option 3: PCEP-LS [I-D.dhodylee-pce-pcep-te-data-extn] extends the
   Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) with TED
   population capability.  A PCEP TE Report message (also referred to as
   TERpt message) is sent by a PCC to a PCE to report the TED state.
   The TE object is a mandatory object which carries TE information of a
   TE node or a TE link.  [I-D.wu-pce-pcep-ls-sr-extension] introduces
   new extensions of PCEP-LS to export path segment information for
   Segment Routing.

   This document adopts Option 3 and introduces a new type of TLV,
   TUNNEL-LABEL-BINDING TLV, which is a new optional TLV defined to
   report the label mapping for the tunnel in the case of Segement
   Routing.  The tunnel can be PCE-initiated tunnel or created by PCC.
   [I-D.chen-pce-pce-initiated-ip-tunnel] defines the PCE-initiated IP
   tunnel and Tunnel object.  Tunnel related TLVs defined in
   [I-D.chen-pce-pce-initiated-ip-tunnel] will be used when report label
   binding for the tunnel.  In order to support Tunnel Segment for MPLS
   TE tunnel and SR-TE tunnel, this document introduces two new tunnel
   types for tunnel related TLVs: RSVP-TE tunnel and SR-TE tunnel.

   In this document TE object will be extended to carry the label
   mapping information for the tunnel.  A new Object-Type value is
   defined for the TE object to indicate Tunnel Segment.  The TE object
   in TERpt message MUST carry both TUNNEL-LABEL-BINDING TLV and Tunnel
   Identifier TLV with the new Object-Type value.  If a PCC wants to
   modify a previously reported label, it MUST send a TERpt message with
   the TUNNEL-LABEL-BINDING TLV containing the new label binding value.
   If the Tunnel Identifier TLV is missing, the PCE will generate an
   error with error-type 6 (mandatory object missing) and error-value
   which means Tunnel Identifier TLV missing and close the session.  If

Internet-Draft     PCEP Extensions for Tunnel Segment         March 2016


   the TUNNEL-LABEL-BINDING TLV is missing, the PCE will generate an
   error with error-type 6 (mandatory object missing) and error-value
   which means TUNNEL-LABEL-BINDING TLV missing and close the session.

   If a PCE does not recognize the TUNNEL-LABEL-BINDING TLV, it MUST
   ignore the TLV in accordance with [RFC5440].  If a PCE recognizes the
   TLV but does not support the TLV, it MUST send PCErr with Error-Type
   = 2 (Capability not supported).  If there are more than one TUNNEL-
   LABEL-BINDING TLVs, only the first TLV MUST be processed and the rest
   MUST be silently ignored.

   If a PCE does not recognize the Tunnel Identifier TLV, it MUST ignore
   the TLV in accordance with [RFC5440].  If a PCE recognizes the TLV
   but does not support the TLV, it MUST send PCErr with Error-Type = 2
   (Capability not supported).  If there are more than one Tunnel
   Identifier TLVs, only the first TLV MUST be processed and the rest
   MUST be silently ignored.

3.2.  Procedure for PCE Download Label Binding

   [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller] has defined the
   Label Update Message (also referred to as PCLabelUpd) that is a PCEP
   message sent by a PCE to a PCC to download label or update the label
   mapping.  The same message is also used to cleanup the label mapping.
   In the procedure for PCE downloading the label binding for Tunnel
   Segment PCE is responsible for allocating the label for PCE-initiated
   tunnel or the tunnel initiated by PCC and reported to PCE.

   [I-D.chen-pce-pce-initiated-ip-tunnel] defines the PCE-initiated IP
   tunnel and the TUNNEL object.  PCE uses the Label Update Message to
   download the label mapping for the tunnel in the case of Segment
   Routing.  The PCLabelUpd Message is defined in
   [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller] and the extension of
   the PCLabelUpd message for tunnel segment is defined as follows:

      <pce-label-update> ::= (<pce-label-download>|<pce-label-map>
                              |<pce-label-tunnel-map>)
   Where:
      <pce-label-tunnel-map> ::= <SRP>
                                 <LABEL>
                                 <TUNNEL>

   TUNNEL object refers to the definition of
   [I-D.chen-pce-pce-initiated-ip-tunnel] and this document extends the
   use of TUNNEL object in PCLabelUpd message.  In order to support
   Tunnel Segment for MPLS TE tunnel and SR-TE tunnel, this document
   introduces two new tunnel types for TLVs used in TUNNEL object: RSVP-
   TE tunnel and SR-TE tunnel.  The TUNNEL object is an optional object

Internet-Draft     PCEP Extensions for Tunnel Segment         March 2016


   and used in the tunnel segment mode in PCLabelUpd message.  TUNNEL
   object in PCLabelUpd message MUST carry the TUNNEL-IDENTIFIER TLV
   with Tunnel ID set.  If the TLV is missing, the PCC will generate a
   PCErr message with Error-Type=6 (mandatory object missing) and Error-
   Value which means Tunnel Identifier TLV missing and close the
   session.

   To cleanup the label mapping for the tunnel the SRP object MUST set
   the R (remove) bit.

   PCE downloads the label mapping to the ingress node of the tunnel and
   create the label forwarding entry for the tunnel segment.  PCE can
   also download the label mapping to other nodes which will use the
   label mapping of the tunnel for SR path computation.

4.  Objects

4.1.  TE object

   TE object is defined in [I-D.dhodylee-pce-pcep-te-data-extn].  This
   document defines a new Object-Type value for TE object:

   o Tunnel Segment: TE Object-Type is 3 (to be assigned by IANA).

5.  TLVs

                 Figure 1: TUNNEL-LABEL-BINDING TLV

   The type of the TLV is to be assigned by IANA and it has a fixed
   length of 4 octets.

   The value contains the following fields:

   Binding Label: contains the binding label which is generic.

5.2.  PATH-SETUP-TYPE TLV

   The PATH-SETUP-TYPE TLV is defined in
   [I-D.sivabalan-pce-lsp-setup-type].  This document defines following
   new PST value:

   o PST = 4(to be assigned by IANA): tunnel segment mode that means
   path setup will use the tunnel segment.

   On a PCLabelUpd message, the PST=4 in PATH-SETUP-TYPE TLV in SRP
   object indicates that this LSP was setup using the tunnel segment.

5.3.  Tunnel Related TLV

   [I-D.chen-pce-pce-initiated-ip-tunnel] defines tunnel related TLVs
   including Tunnel Identifier TLV, Tunnel Name TLV, Tunnel Parameter
   TLV and Tunnel Attribute TLV.  Tunnel Identifier TLV and Tunnel
   Parameter TLV contain the Tunnel Type field and only IP tunnel types
   are defined.  This document defines following two new tunnel types to
   support RSVP-TE tunnel and SR-TE tunnel.  The values are to be
   assigned by IANA and MUST NOT conflict with the registry for "BGP
   Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute Tunnel Types" [RFC5512] assigned by
   IANA.

         Tunnel Type                             Value
         ---------------                         -----
         RSVP-TE                                 14
         SR-TE                                   15

   Tunnel Identifier TLV can be directly used for RSVP-TE tunnel and SR-
   TE tunnel.  Tunnel Parameter TLV for RSVP-TE tunnel and SR-TE tunnel
   will be defined in the future version.
