1. Introduction 

 
   The objective of this document is to define a reference peering  
   architecture in the context of Session PEERing for Multimedia  
   INTerconnect (SPEERMINT). In this process, we define the peering  
   reference architecture (reference, for short), it's functional  
   components, and peering interface functions from the perspective of a  
   real-time communications (Voice and Multimedia) IP Service provider  
   network.   
   
   This architecture allows the interconnection of two service providers  
   in layer 5 peering as defined in the SPEERMINT Requirements [13] and  
   Terminology [12] documents for the purpose SIP-based voice and  
   multimedia traffic.   
 
   Layer 3 peering is outside the scope of this document. Hence, the  
   figures in this document do not show routers so that the focus is on  
   Layer 5 protocol aspects.   
 
   This document uses terminology defined in the SPEERMINT Terminology  
   document [12].                         
 
2. Network Context  

 
   Figure 1 shows an example network context. Two SIP providers can form  
   a Layer 5 peer over either the public Internet or private Layer 3  
   networks. In addition, two or more providers may form a SIP (Layer 5)  
   federation [17] on either the public Internet or private Layer 3  
   networks. This document does not make any assumption whether the SIP  
   providers directly peer to each other or through Layer 3 transit  
   network as per use case of [16].   
 
   Note that Figure 1 allows for the following potential SPEERMINT

   peering scenarios:  
 
   o  Enterprise to Enterprise across the public Internet  
 
   o  Enterprise to Service Provider across the public Internet  
 
   o  Service Provider to Service Provider across the public Internet  
 
   o  Enterprise to enterprise across a private Layer 3 network  
 
   o  Enterprise to Service Provider across a private Layer 3 network  
 
   o  Service Provider to Service Provider across a private Layer 3  
      network  
 
   The members of a federation may jointly use a set of functions such  
   as location peering function, application function, subscriber  
   database function, SIP proxies, and/or functions that synthesize  
   various SIP and non-SIP based applications. Similarly, two providers  
   may jointly use a set of peering functions. The federation functions  
   or the peering functions can be either public or private.

3. Procedures  

 
   This document assumes that a call from an end user in the initiating  
   peer goes through the following steps to establish a call to an end  
   user in the receiving peer:   
 
         1. The analysis of a target address.   
 
             a. If the target address represents an intra-VSP resource,  
                we go directly to step 4.  
 
         2. the discovery of the receiving peering point address,  
 
         3. the enforcement of authentication and other policy,  
 
         4. the discovery of end user address,   
 
         5. the routing of SIP messages,  
 
         6. the session establishment,   
 
         7. the transfer of media,  
 
         8. and the session termination.   
 
4. Reference SPEERMINT Architecture  

   Figure 2 depicts the SPEERMINT architecture and logical functions  
   that form the peering between two SIP service providers.

   o  Location Function (LF): Purpose is to develop Session  
      Establishment Data (SED) by discovering the Signaling Function 
     (SF) and the end user's reachable host (IP address and port). The 
      location function is distributed across the Location Server (LS)  
      and Session Manager (SM). 
 
   o  Signaling Function (SF): Purpose is to perform SIP call routing, 
      to optionally perform termination and re-initiation of call, to 
      optionally implement security and policies on SIP messages, and to  
      assist in discovery/exchange of parameters to be used by the Media  
      Function (MF). The signaling function is located within the  
      Signaling Path Border Element (SBE) 
 
   o  Media Function (MF): Purpose is to perform media related function  
      such as media transcoding and media security implementation  
      between two SIP providers. The media function is located within 
      the Data Path Border Element (DBE).  
 
   The intention of defining these functions is to provide a framework  
   for design segmentation and allow each one to evolve separately.  
 
5. Peer Function Examples  

   This section describes the peering functions in more detail and  
   provides some examples on the role they would play in a SIP call in a  
   Layer 5 peering scenario.  
 
   Some of the information in the chapter is taken from [14].  
 
5.1. The Location Function (LF) of an Initiating Provider  

 
   Purpose is to develop Session Establishment Data (SED) [12] by 
   discovering the Signaling Function (SF), and end user's reachable 
   host (IP address and host). The LF of an Initiating provider analyzes   
   target address and discovers the next hop signaling function (SF) in 
   a peering relationship using DNS, SIP Redirect Server, or a  
   functional equivalent database.    
 
5.1.1. Target address analysis

Internet-Draft      SPEERMINT peering architecture            July 2007 
    

   When the initiating provider receives a request to communicate, the  
   initiating provider analyzes the target state data to determine  
   whether the call needs to be terminated internal or external to its  
   network. The analysis method is internal to the provider's policy;  
   thus, outside the scope of SPEERMINT. Note that the peer is free to  
   consult any manner of private data sources to make this  
   determination.  
 
   If the target address does not represent a resource inside the  
   initiating peer's administrative domain or federation of domains, the  
   initiating provider resolves the call routing data by using the  
   Location Function (LF). Examples of the LF are the functions of ENUM,  
   Routing Table, SIP DNS, and SIP Redirect Server.  
 
   If the request to communicate is for an im: or pres: URI type, the  
   initiating peer follows the procedures in [8].  If the highest  
   priority supported URI scheme is sip: or sips:, the initiating peer  
   skips to SIP DNS resolution in Section 5.1.5. Likewise, if the target  
   address is already a sip: or sips: URI in an external domain, the  
   initiating peer skips to SIP DNS resolution in Section 5.1.5.   
 
   If the target address corresponds to a specific E.164 address, the  
   peer may need to perform some form of number plan mapping according  
   to local policy.  For example, in the United States, a dial string  
   beginning "011 44" could be converted to "+44", or in the United  
   Kingdom "00 1" could be converted to "+1".  Once the peer has an  
   E.164 address, it can use ENUM.  
 
5.1.2. User ENUM Lookup  

   If an external E.164 address is the target, the initiating peer  
   consults the public "User ENUM" rooted at e164.arpa, according to the     
   procedures described in RFC 3761.  The peer MUST query for the  
   "E2U+sip" enumservice as described in RFC 3764 [11], but MAY check  
   for other enumservices.  The initiating peer MAY consult a cache or  
   alternate representation of the ENUM data rather than actual DNS  
   queries.  Also, the peer MAY skip actual DNS queries if the  
   initiating peer is sure that the target address country code is not  
   represented in e164.arpa.  If a sip: or sips: URI is chosen the peer  
   skips to Section 5.1.5.

Internet-Draft      SPEERMINT peering architecture            July 2007 
    

   If an im: or pres: URI is chosen for based on an "E2U+im" [10] or  
   "E2U+pres" [9] enumserver, the peer follows the procedures for  
   resolving these URIs to URIs for specific protocols such a SIP or  
   XMPP as described in the previous section.  
 
5.1.3. Carrier ENUM lookup  

   Next the initiating peer checks for a carrier-of-record in a carrier  
   ENUM domain according to the procedures described in [12].  As in the  
   previous step, the peer MAY consult a cache or alternate  
   representation of the ENUM data in lieu of actual DNS queries.  The  
   peer first checks for records for the "E2U+sip" enumservice, then for  
   the "E2U+pstn" enumservice as defined in [21].  If a terminal record  
   is found with a sip: or sips: URI, the peer skips to Section 5.1.5,  
   otherwise the peer continues processing according to the next  
   section.  
 
5.1.4. Routing Table  

   If there is no user ENUM records and the initiating peer cannot  
   discover the carrier-of-record or if the initiating peer cannot reach  
   the carrier-of-record via SIP peering, the initiating peer still  
   needs to deliver the call to the PSTN or reject the call.  Note that  
   the initiating peer MAY still sends the call to another provider for  
   PSTN gateway termination by prior arrangement using a routing table.   
   If so, the initiating peer rewrites the Request-URI to address the  
   gateway resource in the target provider's domain and MAY forward the  
   request on to that provider using the procedures described in the  
   remainder of these steps.  
 
5.1.5. SIP DNS Resolution  

   Once a sip: or sips: in an external domain is selected as the target, 
   the initiating peer MAY apply local policy to decide whether 
   forwarding requests to the target domain is acceptable.  If so, the 
   initiating peer uses the procedures in RFC 3263 [6] Section 4 to 
   determine how to contact the receiving peer.  To summarize the RFC 
   3263 procedure: unless these are explicitly encoded in the target 
   URI, a transport is chosen using NAPTR records, a port is chosen 
   using SRV records, and an address is chosen using A or AAAA records. 
   Note that these are queries of records in the global DNS.

   When communicating with a public external peer, entities compliant to 
   this document MUST only select a TLS-protected transport for 
   communication from the initiating peer to the receiving peer.  Note 
   that this is a single-hop requirement.  Either peer MAY insist on 
   using a sips: URI which asserts that each hop is TLS-protected, but 
   this document does not require protection over each hop. 
 
5.1.6. SIP Redirect Server    

   A SIP Redirect Server may help in resolving current address of a  
   mobile target address.  
 
5.2. The Location Function (LF) of a Receiving Provider  

5.2.1. Publish ENUM records  

   The receiving peer SHOULD participate by publishing "E2U+sip" and  
   "E2U+pstn" records with sip: or sips: URIs wherever a public carrier  
   ENUM root is available.  This assumes that the receiving peer wants  
   to peer by default.  Even when the receiving peer does not want to  
   accept traffic from specific initiating peers, it MAY still reject  
   requests on a case-by-case basis.  
 
5.2.2. Publish SIP DNS records  

   To receive peer requests, the receiving peer MUST insure that it    
   publishes appropriate NAPTR, SRV, and address (A and/or AAAA) records     
   in the global DNS that resolve an appropriate transport, port, and    
   address to a relevant SIP server.    
 
 
5.2.3. Subscribe Notify   

   Policy function may also be optionally implemented by dynamic  
   subscribe, notify, and exchange of policy information and feature  
   information among providers [22].   
 
5.3. Signaling Function (SF)  

   The purpose of signaling function is to perform routing of SIP  
   messages, to optionally perform termination and re-initiation of a  
   call, to optionally implement security and policies on SIP messages,  
   and to assist in discovery/exchange of parameters to be used by the

   Media Function (MF).   
 
   The routing of SIP messages are performed by SIP proxies. The  
   optional termination and re-initiation of calls are performed by  
   B2BUA.   
 
   Optionally, a SF may perform additional functions such as Session  
   Admission Control, SIP Denial of Service protection, SIP Topology  
   Hiding, SIP header normalization, and SIP security, privacy and  
   encryption.  
 
   The signaling function can also process SDP payloads for media  
   information such as media type, bandwidth, and type of codec; then,  
   communicate this information to the media function. Signaling  
   function may optionally communicate with network layer to pass Layer  
   3 related policies [10]  
 
5.4. The Signaling Function (SF) of an Initiating Provider  

5.4.1. Setup TLS connection 

   Once a transport, port, and address are found, the initiating peer 
   will open or find a reusable TLS connection to the peer.  The 
   initiating provider MUST verify the server certificate which SHOULD 
   be rooted in a well-known certificate authority.  The initiating 
   provider MUST be prepared to provide a TLS client certificate upon 
   request during the TLS handshake.  The client certificate MUST 
   contain a DNS or URI choice type in the subjectAltName which 
   corresponds to the domain asserted in the host production of the From 
   header URI.  The certificate SHOULD be valid and rooted in a well- 
   known certificate authority. 
 
   Note that the client certificate MAY contain a list of entries in the 
   subjectAltName, only one of which has to match the domain in the From 
   header URI. 
 
5.4.2. IPSec  

   In certain deployments the use of IPSec between the signaling 
   functions of the originating and terminating domains can be used as a 
   security mechanism instead of TLS. 
    
 
 
Penno                    Expires January 2008                 [Page 12] 

Internet-Draft      SPEERMINT peering architecture            July 2007 
    

5.4.3. Co-Location   

 
   In this scenario the signaling functions are co-located in a 
   physically secure location and/or are members of a segregated  
   network. In this case messages between the originating and  
   terminating domains would be sent as clear text. 
 
5.4.4. Send the SIP request 

   Once a TLS connection between the peers is established, the 
   initiating peer sends the request.  When sending some requests, the 
   initiating peer MUST verify and assert the senders identity using the 
   SIP Identity mechanism. 
 
   The domain name in the URI of the From: header MUST be a domain which 
   was present in the certificate presented when establishing the TLS 
   connection for this request, even if the user part has an anonymous 
   value.  If the From header contains the user URI parameter with the 
   value of "phone", the user part of the From header URI MUST be a 
   complete and valid tel: URI [9] telephone-subscriber production, and 
   SHOULD be a global-number.  For example, the following are all 
   acceptable, the first three are encouraged: 
 
   From: "John Doe" <john.doe@example.net> 
   From: "+12125551212" <+12125551212@example.net;user=phone> 
   From: "Anonymous" <anonymous@example.net> 
   From: <4092;phone-context=+12125554000@example.net;user=phone> 
   From: "5551212" <5551212@example.net> 
 
   The following are not acceptable: 
 
   From: "2125551212" <2125551212@example.net;user=phone> 
   From: "Anonymous" <anonymous@anonymous.invalid> 
 
   In addition, for new dialog-forming requests and non-dialog-forming 
   requests, the request MUST contain a valid Identity and Identity-Info 
   header as described in [12].  The Identity-Info header must present a 
   domain name which is represented in the certificate presented when 
   establishing the TLS connection over which the request is sent.  The 
   initiating peer SHOULD include an Identity header on in-dialog 

 
 
Penno                    Expires January 2008                 [Page 13]

   requests as well, if the From header field value matches an identity 
   the initiating peer is willing to assert. 
 
   The initiating peer MAY include any SIP option-tags in Supported, 
   Require, or Proxy-Require headers according to procedures in 
   standards-track SIP extensions.  Note however that the initiating 
   peer MUST be prepared to fallback to baseline SIP functionality as 
   defined by the mandatory-to-implement features of RFC 3261, RFC 3263, 
   and RFC 3264 [7], except that peers implementing this specification 
   MUST implement SIP over TLS using the sip: URI scheme, the SIP 
   Identity header, and RFC 4320 [10] non-INVITE transaction fixes. 
 
5.5. The Signaling Function (SF) of an Initiating Provider  

 
5.5.1. Verify TLS connection 

   When the receiving peer receives a TLS client hello, it responds with 
   its certificate.  The receiving peer certificate SHOULD be valid and 
   rooted in a well-known certificate authority.  The receiving peer 
   MUST request and verify the client certificate during the TLS 
   handshake. 
 
   Once the initiating peer has been authenticated, the receiving peer 
   can authorize communication from this peer based on the domain name 
   of the peer and the root of its certificate.  This allows two 
   authorization models to be used, together or separately.  In the 
   domain-based model, the receiving peer can allow communication from 
   peers with some trusted administrative domains which use general- 
   purpose certificate authorities, without explicitly permitting all 
   domains with certificates rooted in the same authority.  It also 
   allows a certificate authority (CA) based model where every domain 
   with a valid certificate rooted in some list of CAs is automatically 
   authorized. 
 
5.5.2. Receive SIP requests 

   Once a TLS connection is established, the receiving peer is prepared 
   to receive incoming SIP requests.  For new dialog-forming requests 
   and out-of-dialog requests, the receiving peer verifies that the 
   target (request-URI) is a domain which for which it is responsible. 
   (For these requests, there should be no remaining Route header field 
 
 
Penno                    Expires January 2008                 [Page 14] 

Internet-Draft      SPEERMINT peering architecture            July 2007 
    

   values.)  Next the receiving verifies that the Identity header is 
   valid, corresponds to the message, corresponds to the Identity-Info 
   header, and that the domain in the From header corresponds to one of 
   the domains in the TLS client certificate. 
 
   For in-dialog requests, the receiving peer can verify that it 
   corresponds to the top-most Route header field value.  The peer also 
   validates any Identity header if present. 
 
   The receiving peer MAY reject incoming requests due to local policy. 
   When a request is rejected because the initiating peer is not 
   authorized to peer, the receiving peer SHOULD respond with a 403 
   response with the reason phrase "Unsupported Peer". 
 
5.6. Media Function (MF)  

 
   Examples of the media function is to transform voice payload from one  
   coding (e.g., G.711) to another (e.g., EvRC), media relaying, media  
   security, privacy, and encryption.  
 
   Editor's Note: This section will be further updated.  
 
5.7. Policy Considerations  

   In the context of the SPEERMINT working group when two Layer 5  
   devices (e.g., SIP Proxies) peer, there is a need to exchange peering  
   policy information. There are specifications in progress in the  
   SIPPING working group to define policy exchange between an UA and a  
   domain [23] and providing profile data to SIP user agents [24] These  
   considerations borrow from both.  
 
   Following the terminology introduced in [12], this package uses the  
   terms Peering Session-Independent and Session-Specific policies in  
   the following context.  
 
   o  Peering Session-Independent policies include Diffserv Marking,  
      Policing, Session Admission Control, domain reachabilities,  
      amongst others. The time period between Peering Session- 
      Independent policy changes is much greater than the time it takes  
      to establish a call.   
 
 
 
Penno                    Expires January 2008                 [Page 15] 

Internet-Draft      SPEERMINT peering architecture            July 2007 
    

   o  Peering Session-Specific polices includes supported  
      connection/call rate, total number of connections/calls available,  
      current utilization, amongst others. Peering Session-specific  
      policies can change within the time it takes to establish a call.  
 
   These policies can be Peer dependent or independent, creating the  
   following peering policy tree definition:   
 
           Peer Independent   
              Session dependent   
              Session independent   
           Peer Dependent   
              Session dependent   
              Session independent   
 
6. Call Control and Media Control Deployment Options  

   The peering functions can either be deployed along the following two  
   dimensions depending upon how the signaling function and the media  
   function along with IP functions are implemented:  
 
   Composed or Decomposed:  Addresses the question whether the media  
   paths must flow through the same physical and geographic nodes as the  
   call signaling,  
 
   Centralized or Distributed:  Addresses the question whether the  
   logical and physical peering points are in one geographical location  
   or distributed to multiple physical locations on the service provider  
   network.  
 
   In a composed model, SF and MF functions are implemented in one  
   peering logical element.

                 Figure 3: Decomposed v. Collapsed Peering 
 
   The advantage of a collapsed peering architecture is that one-element  
   solves all peering issues. Disadvantage examples of this architecture  
   are single point failure, bottle neck, and complex scalability.  
 
   In a decomposed model, SF and MF are implemented in separate peering  
   logical elements. Signaling functions are implemented in a proxy and  
   media functions are implemented in another logical element.  The  
   scaling of signaling versus scaling of media may differ between  
   applications.  Decomposing allows each to follow a separate migration  
   path.  
 
   This model allows the implementation of M:N model where one SF is  
   associated with multiple peering MF and one peering MF is associated  
   with multiple peering proxies. Generally, a vertical protocol  
   associates the relationship between a SF and a MF. This architecture  
   reduces the potential of single point failure. This architecture,  
   allows separation of the policy decision point and the policy  
   enforcement point. An example of disadvantages is the scaling  
   complexity because of the M:N relationship and latency due to the  
   vertical control messages between entities.

7. Address space considerations  

 
   Peering must occur in a common address space, which is defined by the  
   federation, which may be entirely on the public Internet, or some  
   private address space. The origination or termination networks may or  
   may not entirely be in that same address space.  If they are not,  
   then a translation (NAT) may be needed before the signaling or media  
   is presented to the federation. The only requirement is that all  
   entities across the peering interface are reachable.  
 
8. Security Considerations  

 
   In all cases, cryptographic-based security should be maintained as an  
   optional requirement between peering providers conditioned on the  
   presence or absence of underlying physical security of peer  
   connections, e.g. within the same secure physical building.    
 
   In order to maintain a consistent approach, unique and specialized  
   security requirements common for the majority of peering  
   relationships, should be standardized within the IETF.  These  
   standardized methods may enable capabilities such as dynamic peering  
   relationships across publicly maintained interconnections.  
 
   TODO:  Address RFC-3552 BCP items.    
 
9. IANA Considerations  

 
   There are no IANA considerations at this time.
