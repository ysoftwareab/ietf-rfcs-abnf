Abstract

   This Memo defines the SKiCal format.

   SKiCal is a machine-readable format for the interchange of enhanced
   yellow-page directory listings.  SkiCal expands the traditional
   property-set of name, address, telephone number and business
   category,  adding structured information about people, places,
   things, activities  and the conditions and terms for interaction with
   resources.  SkiCal provides a structure for access information in

   dates and times, directions, rules and recommendations for
   participation, pricing and reservation schemes, access information
   for those with special needs, ownership and responsibilities and
   promotional material.  The referents of these listings, which are
   both events and persistent resources are referred to in this draft as
   SKiSources.

   SKiCal is based on and extends the iCalendar format as defined by
   RFC-2445, Internet Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object
   Specification [3] (iCalendar).  SKiCal objects are comprised of
   either VEVENT components with the addition of new properties and
   property parameters, or the SkiCal specific VOPTIME calendar
   component described in this memo.

Internet-Draft                   SKiCal                        July 2001


1. Introduction

   SKiCal combines the iCalendar usage domain of appointments and
   business meetings with the needs of producers, brokers and  end-users
   of resources and services in commerce, tourism, sport, recreation,
   health-care, culture, education etc.  SKiCal users are both
   "TimeSpenders" seeking information about available resources
   (SKiSources) and "Publishers" wishing to make that information
   public.

   Machine-readable directory information serves several purposes;

   1.  The organization of object properties into structures convenient
       for rapid, efficient storage and retrieval.

   2.  The exchange of compatible objects of information across
       divergent platforms

   3.  The facilitation of automatically generated lay-out for print,
       screen and audio representations.

   4.  The facilitation of automatic translation.

   5.  The wide-scale discovery and harvesting of information via the
       Internet with previously unobtainable accuracy.

2. Reading instructions and conventions

   This document is intended to be read alongside RFC-2445 [3].  The
   same basic grammar and formatting conventions that apply to iCal,
   also apply to SKiCal.  For the sake of brevity, the syntax and
   clarifications of the data-types, properties and property parameters
   of RFC-2445 will not be repeated here.

   The notation used in this memo is the ABNF notation of RFC-2234 [6].
   Readers intending on implementing the format defined in this memo
   should be familiar with this notation in order to properly interpret
   the specifications.  Also, they MUST be familiar with the iCalendar
   core object specification (RFC-2445 [3]).

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [2].

2.1 SKiCal Terminology

   The following terms are used in this memo:

2.1.1 SkiCal

   The Term "SkiCal" refers to the methodology described in this note.
   Though originally "S K I" reflected the Scandinavian origins of this
   effort, serving as  an  acronym for "Svenska Kalender Initiativet"
   (Swedish Calendar Initiative), this interpretation of the SKi acronym
   was changed in September 2000 so that "S K I"  now stands for  the
   "Structured Knowledge Initiative".  There is no relationship to the
   winter sport "skiing", though of course Skiing events could be
   described using SKiCal.

2.1.2 SkiSource

   The term "SkiSource" is used to denote a resource existing in time
   and space.  A SkiSource could be a restaurant, a clothing store, a
   theatre or individual performance at a theatre, a public drinking
   fountain, a hospital emergency ward, a service station, a radio
   program, a webcast, or any other similar resource.  Today such
   resources are listed in various directories, such as telephone
   catalogs, the entertainment section of newspapers, television and
   radio program guides, Internet guides, tourist brochures, the
   academic schedules of schools, or a community's listing of public
   services.

Internet-Draft                   SKiCal                        July 2001


2.1.3 SkiCal object

   The term "SkiCal object" is used in this memo to denote the calendar
   object description of a SkiSource using the mime-directory format
   described in RFC2445 as follows; "The format for the iCalendar object
   is based on the syntax of the RFC 2425 content type.  While the
   iCalendar object is not a profile of the RFC 2425 content type, it
   does reuse a number of the elements from the RFC 2425 specification."

2.1.4 Publisher

   The term "Publisher" is used in this memo to denote the publisher(s)
   of SKiCal objects.  Publishers could be the owners or producers of a
   SkiSource.  Publishers could be infomediaries making public the
   existence of a SkiSource.

2.1.5 List

   The term "list" is used to denote a pre-published enumeration or
   taxonomy of value-terms.  It is RECOMMENDED that publishers use terms
   from such lists as the values of TEXT type properties in order to
   facilitate the machine readability of their information.  A method
   for refering to such a list is described in this memo.

2.1.6 TimeSpender

   The term "TimeSpender" is used in this memo to denote the end
   consumer or beneficiary of SKiCal information.  SKiCal is structured
   from the view point of the TimeSpender.  A typical SkiCal object
   contains the answers to the most likely questions a TimeSpender might
   ask in order to interact (or make decisions about interacting) with a
   SkiSource.

2.1.7 The 'Wha' Interrogatives

   The new properties introduced in this memo, as well as the original
   properties of RFC2445, are herein sorted by their function as the
   answers to 6 categories of queries.

2.1.7.1 WHAT

   The WHAT property is the place holder for the answers to questions
   such as: What is it? What is happening? What is there? What is it
   called? What people, things and concepts will be involved?

2.1.7.2 WHEN

   The WHEN property is the place holder for the answers to questions

Internet-Draft                   SKiCal                        July 2001


   such as: When will it happen? When is it open? When can I go there?

2.1.7.3 WHERE

   The WHERE property is the place holder for the answers to questions
   such as: Where will it happen? Where is it located?

2.1.7.4 WHOW

   The WHOW property is the place holder for the answers to questions
   such as: How can I attend? How can I join? How can I buy? The word
   "how" is intentionally misspelled to indicate relationship to the
   other interrogatives, all beginning with "WH".

2.1.7.5 WHY

   The WHY property is the place holder for the answers to questions
   such as: Why is this happening? Why is this of interest or value to
   me?

2.1.7.6 WHO

   The WHO property is the place holder for the answers to questions
   such as: Who is the owner? Who is the producer? Who is Responsible?
   Who do I sue?

3. SKiCal specific property parameters

   The following SKiCal property parameters are in addition to those
   defined by RFC-2445  Section 4.2 [3] and may be used as specified for
   the individual properties of this memo.


     skicalparameters  =

                / item             ; specific resource being qualified
                / nsref            ; reference valuelist URI pointer
                / skirole          ; qualify property values

                ; the following are members of the optimeset

                / opterm           ; period of optime validity
                / opseasons        ; reoccurring periods of optimes
                / opdays           ; reoccurring days of optimes
                / ophours          ; reoccurring hours of optimes
                / opminutes        ; reoccurring minutes of optimes


3.1 The OpeningTimes Set

   An iCalendar VEVENT component can only describe one complete date-
   time set and its eventual recurrences, such as office meetings or
   lunch appointments.  Using the SkiCal OpeningTimes set of Property
   Parameters comprised of OPTERM, OPSEASONS, OPDAYS, OPHOURS and
   OPMINUTES, individual SkiCal properties MAY be qualified with date
   and time values.  For example, through the use of the OPTIMESET a
   publisher could within one calendar object describe not only the
   general date-times of a conference, but also when a refreshment bar
   was open, the telephone times for a help desk, the last date for
   submitting papers, and the opening times of the conference hall
   itself.

   Or in another example, through the use of this OPTIMESET a publisher
   could within one calendar object describe the operating times of a
   petrol station, differentiating between levels of service such as
   when a mechanic was on duty, when the convenience store was open or
   full service available.

3.1.1 Terms used in the optimeset declaration

      "OPEN": Depending upon the property value being qualified, OPEN
      indicates open, accessible, in-force, operative, available or any
      similar state permitting interaction with the resource designated
      by the property value.

Internet-Draft                   SKiCal                        July 2001


      "CLOSED": Depending upon the property value being qualified,
      CLOSED indicates closed, non-accessible, not-in-force, non-
      operative, not-available or any similar state inhibiting
      interaction with the resource designated by the property value.

      NOT-VALID": Dates and times that can not be determined as being
      open or closed.

      "INSTANCE": The inniating instance for the class of date-time
      value representations made up of year, month, day, hour, minute,
      or second is that moment in time that separates an ordinal member
      of such a class from its predecessor in the same class.

      The concluding instance for the class of date-time value
      representations made up of  year, month, day, hour, minute, second
      is that moment in time that separates an ordinal member of such a
      class from its successor in the same class.

      DATE-TIME VALUE PAIR: All of the optimeset's property parameters
      have a value consisting of one or more pairs of INSTANCES, with
      the exception of the OPDAYS values, where the pair is implied as
      the beginning and end of a day.

      INCLUSIVE-TO: From the innitating to the concluding INSTANCE of
      the date-time value pair.

      EXCLUSIVE-TO Any date-time value preceding the inniating INSTANCE
      of the date-time value pair or any date-time value following the
      concluding instance of the date-time value pair.

      The value of each optimeset property parameter consists of one or
      more  date-time periods delimited by an inniating and concluding
      INSTANCE.  The duration of these date-time periods is to be
      interpreted as follows:

      For period-explicit time periods.

      For the earlier value of  the date-time value pair: From the
      inniating instance of the least significant date-time value.
      Example: for "YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS" - From the inniating instance of
      the "SS" of the MM of the HH of the DD of the MM of the YYYY.

      For the later value of the date-time value pair: Up until the
      concluding instance of the least significant datetime value.
      Example: for YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS - Until the concluding instance of
      the "SS" of the MM of the HH of the DD of the MM of the YYYY.

      This means that whenever two halves of one value-pair are

Internet-Draft                   SKiCal                        July 2001


      designated with different time zone identifiers, or whenever a
      day-light savings change is inclusive to the resulting period
      value, or whenever a leap day or leap second is inclusive to the
      period value, then the duration of the period value will be
      lengthened or shortened accordingly.

      For period-start time periods.

      For the "anchoring" value of the value-pair:

      If the Duration value is indicated as greater than zero: From the
      inniating instance of the least significant datetime value.
      Example: for "YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS" - From the inniating instance of
      the "SS" of the MM of the HH of the DD of the MM of the YYYY.

      If the "anchoring" value is indicated as less than zero: Up until
      the concluding instance of the least significant datetime value.
      Example: for YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS - Until the concluding instance of
      the "SS" of the MM of the HH of the DD of the MM of the YYYY.

      To the anchoring value, the duration value is either added or
      subtracted in order to calculate the period value.  This means
      that whenever a day-light savings change is inclusive to the
      resulting period value, or whenever a leap day or leap second is
      inclusive to the period value, then the duration of the period
      value will be maintained and the start or end date-time of the
      period will be lengthened or shortened accordingly.  Since no
      timezone identifier can be concatenated to the duration value, a
      period-start date-time value can only be referenced to one
      timezone.

   Format Definition: The OpeningTimes set of Property Parameters is
   defined by the following notation:

            optimeset   =    [ ";" opterm] [ ";" opseasons]
                             [ ";" opdays] [ ";" ophours]
                             [ ";" opminutes]

3.1.2 Rules of optime set composition

   One optimeset may contain one of 31 combinations of property
   parameter inclusions.  For the sake of brevity the OPMINUTES property
   parameter will be described separately.  With the OPMINUTES property
   parameter fixed as not-declared, 15 possible combinations will be
   represented in the table below as examples 1 to F.  For each property
   parameter "X" symbolizes that it is included in an optimeset and "0"
   that it is not.


   Example        1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  A  B  C  D  E  F

   OPTERM         X  0  X  0  X  0  X  0  X  0  X  0  X  0  X
   OPSEASONS      0  X  X  0  0  X  X  0  0  X  X  0  0  X  X
   OPDAYS         0  0  0  X  X  X  X  0  0  0  0  X  X  X  X
   OPHOURS        0  0  0  0  0  0  0  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X
   OPMINUTES      0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0

   The hierarchical significance of  15 possible combinations (in the
   absence of OPMINUTES) is illustrated in the following table.  For
   each column representing an optimeset property parameter there are
   two alternatives:

      Inclusive-to the defined period (in)

      Exclusive-to the defined period (ex)

   For each of these alternatives there are three possible outcomes for
   date-times;

      Open (OP)

      Closed (CL)

      Not-valid (NV)

3.1.3 Determining Time Values  in the Optimeset

   There is a hierarchical ordering of the members of the optimeset,
   irrespective of their ordinal positioning in the property.  The order
   from high to low is; OPTERM, OPSEASONS, OPDAYS, OPHOURS, OPMINUTES.
   A higher order member of the set, if included, will always constrain
   the values of the lower order members.

   Here are some outcomes for different combinations of an optimeset.
   All but the first are bad examples of optimeset composition since
   higher order members completely block out lower order members.

   date-time value separated by a SOLIDUS character; "/" (US- ASCII
   decimal 47),from one of two value types; THISANDPRIOR and
   THISANDFUTURE.  By the use of THISANDPRIOR the date-time value pair
   signifies an OPTERM period whose start time is either not relevant or
   unknown.  By the use of THISANDFUTURE the date-time value pair
   signifies   an OPTERM whose conclusion is either not relevant or
   unknown.  The start date-time value of an OPTERM period must not be
   greater than its end date-time value.

   If the start of the period is of a greater value than the end of the
   period, 24 hours will be added to the end value in order to calculate
   the correct time period.

   In the following example the "Dance Floor" would be calculated as
   starting at 18:00:00 UTC and ending at 03:00:00 UTC on the following
   day.

       DTOPEN;OPHOURS=180000Z/030000Z:The Dance Floor

   Period-start: A period of time can also be defined by a start time
   and a positive duration of time.  This method should be used for
   declarations of time periods exceeding 24 hours.

   In the following example the period starting at 18:00:00 UTC on
   Friday and ending at 15:30:00 UTC on Sunday could be declared as:

       DTOPEN;BYDAYS=FR;OPHOURS=180000Z/PT45H30M:Every weekend in the
        mountains

   It is expected that publishers wishing to optimize interoperability
   will choose values from enumerated lists of value-terms.  These lists
   can be utilized for constraining the values of both properties and
   property parameters.  The declaration for the URI of  such a list is
   accomplished using the NAMESPACE property.  The NAMESPACE property
   can also assign a shorthand prefix to the URI value of the NAMESPACE
   and this prefix can be referenced using the NSREF property parameter.

   Example:

      RESOURCES;NSREF="QLL":HL984 projector
      PERSONS;NSREF="WW":Bill Clinton

4. SKiCal specific calendar component

   The body of an iCalendar object consists of a sequence of calendar
   properties and one or more calendar components.  The calendar
   properties are attributes that apply to the calendar as a whole.  The
   calendar components are collections of properties that express a
   particular calendar semantic.  For example, the calendar component
   can specify an event, a to-do, a journal entry, time zone
   information, or free/busy time information, or an alarm.

   A SkiCal extended iCalendar object may include a "VOPTIME" calendar
   component as defined by the following notation:





        component  =  (
                      / optimec
                      )



4.1 The OpTime calendar component

   Component Name: "OPTIME

   Purpose: Provide a grouping of component properties that describe the
   opening times of a SkiSource.

   Format Definition: An "OPTIME" calendar component is defined by the
   following notation:

                   dtopen / contact / related / resources / x-prop


                   )

   Description: An "OPTIME" calendar component is a grouping of
   component properties, and possibly including "VALARM" calendar
   components, that represents a date-time value that we normally refer
   to as opening hours or business hours or operating hours.  The OPTIME
   component can be used to declare such times for any imaginable
   resource.  Generally, Opening Time schedules in any significant
   number are not ideal for visual representation in traditional PIM
   calendars, since if stored in an "opaque" manner they would "clutter
   up" the limited visual space available.  Is is recommended that
   implementers develop alternative methods for visual representation of
   Optime calendar components.

   The "OPTIME" calendar component is identical to the "VEVENT" calendar
   component with the exception that the Date-time related properties
   such as DTSTART, DTEND and DURATION have been removed in favour of
   the DTOPEN property.

   Example: The following is an example of the "VOPTIME" calendar
   component used to represent the business hours of a video rental
   store that is open daily from 10am to 10pm, except for Fridays and
   Saturdays, when open to 12pm :

5. SKiCal specific component properties

   The class of SKiCal objects is a superset of the class of iCalendar
   objects.  Therefore any component property, which MAY appear in a
   VEVENT iCalendar component, is also allowed in a SKiCal object.  In
   addition, the following component properties are defined in this
   memo.

      eventprop  =    /  *(

                          ; the following are optional,
                          ; but MUST NOT occur more than once

                          publisher / skuid / whurl

                          ; the following are optional,
                          ; and MAY occur more than once

                          access / actions / bookings /
                          control / directions / namespace /
                          orientation / partrel / paymethod /
                          persons / placename / price /
                          prohibited / promo / recommended
                          required / skicalver / skilang
                          things / thinks / title

                         )

   It is RECOMMENDED that publishers chose the terms used as TEXT type
   property values from authoritative lists of terms.  Section 6

   For reasons of clarity the properties self-describing the SkiCal
   object are presented under the "MANAGEMENT" header (Calendar object
   management), while properties describing the actual SkiSource are
   presented under the interrogative headers; "WHAT", "WHEN", "WHERE",
   "WHO", "WHY", and "WHOW".  For example, the date when a SKiCal object
   describing a SkiSource was published would be defined by RFC2445
   4.8.7.1 Date/Time Created, and this property would be sorted under
   MANAGEMENT while the date the actual SkiSource being described occurs
   is defined by RFC2445 4.8.2.4 Date/Time Start which would be sorted
   under WHEN.  The creator of a SKiCal object describing a SkiSource is
   defined by RFC2445 4.8.4.3 Organizer, and this property would be
   sorted under MANAGEMENT while the "organizer" or producer of the
   actual SkiSource being described could be defined by the one of the
   SKiCal properties such as Section 5.6.1 which would be sorted under
   WHO.

5.1 WHAT properties

   The following properties serve as place-holders for the answers to
   user questions about the SkiSource such as "What is it?" and "What is
   happening?".

   The properties defined in RFC-2445 [3] related to WHAT are:

      4.8.1.2 Categories

      4.8.1.11 Status

   4.8.1.12 Summary

   In addition to the properties named above as defined in RFC-2445 [3],
   a SKiCal object may include the following properties

5.1.1 Title

   Property Name: TITLE

   Purpose: This property specifies the title of the SkiSource being
   described.

   Value Type: TEXT.

   Property Parameters: Non-standard and language property parameters
   can be specified on this property.

   Conformance: This property CAN be specified within a "VEVENT" or
   "VOPTIME" calendar component.

   Description: Public SKiSources often have titles .  The title may not
   be directly descriptive of the SkiSource.  The Title might be
   abstract in nature or it might be a copyrighted name that an owner
   wishes to see included in the calendar object.  The following example
   illustrates the difference between SUMMARY and TITLE: A photo
   exhibition by photographer Collier Schorr in New York City called
   "Excuse Me While I Kiss the Sky" can be described by these two lines
   in a SKiCal file:


   SUMMARY:Collier Schorr photos on exhibit in NYC
   TITLE:Excuse Me While I Kiss the Sky

   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

   parameter (cnparam) be specified on this property.

   Conformance: This property CAN be specified within a "VEVENT" or
   "VOPTIME" calendar component.

   Description: This property allows for the publisher of a SKiSource to
   indicate a relation to another SKiSource.  This property differs from
   the RELATED-TO property of RFC-2445 [3], which defines a relationship
   between calendar objects describing SKiSources and not between
   SKiSources themselves.

   NOTE: If the SKiSource is being translated, the information about
   what languages are available as translations could be published under
   RESOURCES.

   NOTE: If knowledge of a certain language is required in order to
   appreciate the SKiSource, this should be indicated by a REQUIRED (or
   RECOMMENDED) property.

   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

5.1.8 Orientation

   Property Name: ORIENTATION

   Purpose: This property specifies the target audiences for the
   SKiSource.

   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
   specified on this property.

   Conformance: This property CAN be specified within a "VEVENT" or
   "VOPTIME" calendar component.

   Description: This property can facilitate SKiSource discovery.  It
   can indicate that a SKiSource has a specific target audience or
   consummer type, or that it is related to a specific cause, faith,
   professional group, gender, ethnic group etc.  Infomediaries can use
   this property to define their own specific customer orientation types
   without altering the values in CATEGORIES.

   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

5.1.9 What URL

   Property Name: WHURL

   Purpose: This property defines a Uniform Resource Locator (URL)
   associated with the SKiSource the SKICal object is describing.

   Value Type: URI

   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
   specified on this property.

   Conformance: This property CAN be specified within a "VEVENT" or
   "VOPTIME" calendar component.

   Description: This property may be used in a SKiCal object to convey a
   URL for information about the SKiSource.  The difference between
   WHURL and the iCal Property URL as defined in RFC2445 section 4.8.4.6
   is that while URL points to some place "where a more dynamic
   rendition of the calendar information associated with the calendar
   component can be found", WHURL points to the "home page" of the
   SKiSource itself.  This memo does not attempt to standardize the form
   of the URI, nor the format of the resource pointed to by the property
   value.

   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

5.1.10 SKiSource Unique Identifier

   Property Name: SKUID

   Purpose: This property specifies a persistent, globally unique
   identifier for the SKiSource.

   Value Type: TEXT

   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
   specified on this property.

   Description: This property provides a method for determining a
   definite, authoritative and unique identification of a SKiSource.
   SKUID differs from the UID property defined in RFC2445 section
   4.8.4.7, whereas UID identifies a calendar component (SKiCal object),
   SKUID identifies the SKiSource being defined by the calendar
   component.

   The SKUID itself MUST be a globally unique identifier.  The generator
   of the identifier MUST guarantee that the identifier is unique.
   There are several algorithms that can be used to accomplish this.
   The identifier is RECOMMENDED to be the identical syntax to the RFC-
   822 [7] addr-spec.  A good method to assure uniqueness is described
   in RFC-2445 [3], section 4.8.4.7 about Unique Identification Numbers.

   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

5.2 WHEN properties

   The following properties answer time and date related questions about
   the SKiSource, such as "When is it open" and "When does it happen?".

   The properties defined in RFC-2445 [3] related to WHEN are:

      4.8.2 Date and Time Component Properties

      4.8.3 Time Zone Component Properties

      4.8.5 Recurrence Component Properties


5.2.1 Date-time open

   Property Name: DTOPEN

   Purpose: This property can be used to specify reoccurring date-time
   schedules such as the opening -, operating -, accessible times of a
   SkiSource.  This Property is suitable for "persistent resources",
   that is resources that unlike events have  regular persistent
   operating hours.  Though in some cases a publisher could describe
   opening hours using the existing time-date properties and reoccurence
   rules of RFC2445, those rules are not optimized  for this sort of
   use.   Further, a collection of such SKiSources, for example all the
   shops and restaurants in one's neighbourhood, would clutter a
   traditional PIM calendar, where events are expected to happen in a
   more or less serial fashion.

Internet-Draft                   SKiCal                        July 2001


   Conformance: This property can be specified in a "VOPTIME" calendar
   component.

   Value Type: The default value type is TEXT.

   Property Parameters: Non-standard, value data type, time zone
   identifier property parameters can be specified on this property.

   Description: This property defines access information for a SKiSource
   - what are usually called the hours of business or operation.  The
   date time values are stated through the optimesset of property
   parameters.  The value of the Property is a text label describing
   what the  opening times derived through the optimeset are referring
   to.  The optimeset can be used to qualify several of the SKiCAl
   properties.  If a SkiSource can be considered to have a "main",
   "primary" or "essential" Opening Times, then it is recommended that
   the DTOPEN property be used to declare these.

   There is a known discrepancy in RFC2445.  In section 4.6.1 Event
   Component, the ABNF declares that there are no obligatory properties
   in a VEVENT Component, while in 4.8.2.4 Date/Time Start it is stated
   that "The property is REQUIRED in "VEVENT" calendar components.  Even
   though the ABNF takes precedent over prose, until this discrepancy
   is resolved it is recommended that SKiCal publishers always include a
   DTSTART property in a SkiCal object.  If the publishers intention is
   to declare Opening Times and not the date-times of a specific event,
   it is recommended that they use the VOPTIME calendar component.

   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

        dtopen    = "DTOPEN" opentimeparam ":" TEXT CRLF

        opentimeparam  = *(

                   ; the following are optional,

5.3 WHERE properties

   The following properties serve as place-holders for the answers to
   user questions about the SKiSource such as "Where does it happen?"
   and "Where do I find the SKiSource?".

   The properties defined in RFC-2445 [3] related to WHERE are:

      4.8.1.6 Geographic Position (GEO)

      4.8.1.7 Location

   SKICal objects SHOULD use vCards [RFC 2426] as an ALTREP parameter
   value to the LOCATION property parameter, in order to provide machine
   readability and maintain information structure when exchanging data.
   For example, the alternate representation may specify either an LDAP
   URI pointing to an LDAP server entry or a CID URI pointing to a MIME
   body part containing a vCard for the location.

   In addition to the properties named above as defined in RFC-2445 [3],
   a SKICal object may include the following properties.

5.3.1 Venue

   Property Name: VENUE

   Purpose: This property classifies the type of physical context in
   which an SKiSource takes place.

   Value Type: TEXT.

   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
   specified on this property.

   Conformance: This property CAN be specified within a "VEVENT" or
   "VOPTIME" calendar component.

   Description: The venue parameter divides SKiSources into a number of
   distinctly different groups, this is useful when there is a need to
   quickly reduce the number of SKiSources in a selection.  For example:
   When searching for outdoor sport SKiSources to take part in, it will
   help not having to browse through listings of TV shows showing
   sports.

   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

                         "Travel-transit"

   Conformance: This property CAN be specified within a "VEVENT" or
   "VOPTIME" calendar component.

   Example: The following are examples of this property:

           VENUE:Outdoors
           VENUE:TV

5.3.2 Directions

   Property Name: DIRECTIONS

   Purpose: This property can be used to specify helpful directions for
   finding the SKiSource.

   Value Type: TEXT.

   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
   specified on this property.

   Conformance: This property CAN be specified within a "VEVENT" or
   "VOPTIME" calendar component.

   Description: Very often when a public SKiSource is published, there
   are instructions other than the address for finding the location.  In
   metropolitan areas this could be just the name of a subway stop,
   while on the sea it could possibly be a path defined by a series of
   GEO (longitude + latitude) coordinates that will help sailors avoid
   shallow water.

   attend?" and "Why would this be interesting?".

   WHY gathers promotional, instructive or informational material under
   one roof.  It is hoped that this will promote expedience.  Many
   applications will be operating in a narrow bandwidth environment;
   this is specially the case with mobile cellular phones, PDA's and
   other digiphernalia.

   By placing content which might be bulky and bandwidth consuming in a
   specifically defined area of the Calendar Object, the TimeSpender as
   well as the SKiSource publisher is given greater control over
   individual property access.

   There is no property defined in RFC-2445 [3] that is directly related
   to WHY.  Though iCal publishers could use the ATTACHMENT property to
   wrap promotional material or put promotional texts into DESCRIPTION.

5.5.1 Promotion

   Property Name: PROMO

   Purpose: This property allows for the organizer of the SKiSource to
   refer to advertising material, in various forms.

   Value Type: URI

   "VOPTIME" calendar component.

   Description: This property could be a link to online versions of a
   movie trailer, a web campaign, a radio spot or a newspaper ad.

5.6 WHO properties

   The following property serves as place-holders for the answers to
   user questions about the SKiSource such as; Who is responsible? Who
   is the owner? Who authorized this? What organizations are involved?

   The properties defined in RFC-2445 [3] related to WHO are:

   4.8.4.2 Contact

   It is RECOMMENDED that SKICal objects use vCards [RFC 2426] as an
   ALTREP parameter value to the CONTACT property parameter, in order to
   provide machine readability and maintain information structure when
   exchanging data.  For example, the alternate representation may
   specify either an LDAP URI pointing to an LDAP server entry or a CID
   URI pointing to a MIME body part containing a vCard for the contact.

5.7 MANAGEMENT properties

   The above SKICal component properties all describe the SKiSource
   itself (description) and not, as is the case with many iCalendar
   component properties, the entry in a calendar user agent (CUA) or
   calendar server (CS) (self-description).

   It is possible that several, or even many calendar objects could
   refer to the same SKiSource.  Each of these calendar objects could
   have their own publisher, while the SKiSource itself has only one
   responsible authority.

   The properties defined in RFC-2445 [3] related to MANAGEMENT are:

      4.8.1.3 Classification

      4.8.1.4 Comment

      4.8.4.3 Organizer

      4.8.4.5 Related-to

      4.8.4.6 Uniform Resource Locator

      4.8.4.7 Unique Identifier

      4.8.7.3 Last Modified

      4.8.7.4 Sequence Number


5.7.1 Publisher

   Property Name: PUBLISHER

   Purpose: Describes the organization or private party publishing the
   SKiSource object.

   Value Type: URI

   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
   specified on this property.

   Conformance: This property CAN be specified within a "VEVENT" or
   "VOPTIME" calendar component.

   Description: The ORGANIZER of a SKiSource is not always the one who
   makes the information about the SKiSource publicly available.  Many
   SkiCal objects will be published by organizations or private parties
   who are not an "ORGANIZER" as defined in RFC2445.   The role of the
   publisher is sometimes referred to as 'Infomediary'.

   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

   Example: The following are examples of this property:

   PUBLISHER:mailto:info@timeout.co.uk

5.7.2 SkiCAl Version

   Property Name:SKICALVER

   Property Name:SKICALVER

   Purpose: The inclusion of this property in an iCalendar object
   indicates the presence of SKiCal extensions.  At the same time this
   property specifies the identifier corresponding to the highest
   version number or the minimum and maximum range of the SkiCal
   specification that is required in order to interpret the SkiCal
   extensions.

   Value Type: TEXT

   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
   specified on this property.

   Conformance: This property CAN be specified within a "VEVENT" or
   "VOPTIME" calendar component.  This property MUST be specified by an
   iCalendar object containing any of the SkiCal extensions defined in
   this memo, but MAY only be specified once.

   Description: A value of "1.0" corresponds to this memo.

   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

                   / maxver
                   / (minver ";" maxver)

        minver     = <A IANA registered SKiCal version identifier>

        ; Minimum SKiCal version needed to parse the SkiCal extensions
        ; in the iCalendar object

        maxver     = <A IANA registered SkiCal version identifier>

        ; Maximum SKiCal version needed to parse the SKiCal extensions
        ; in the iCalendar object

   Example: The following is an example of this property:

        SKICALVER:1.0

5.7.3 NAMESPACE

   Property Name: NAMESPACE

   Purpose: Designates a URL containing a list of values and assigns a
   prefix as a shorthand pointer to that URL.

   Value Type: URI

   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
   specified on this property.

   Conformance: This property CAN be specified within a "VEVENT" or
   "VOPTIME" calendar component.

   Description: For many of the properties and property parameters of
   this note, it is recommended that text values be chosen from
   authoritative lists.  This property defines a method for the
   identification and location of such a list, but it does not define
   the syntax that such a list might employ.  The inclussion of a
   NAMESPACE properery in a calendar component does not imply that a
   SKiCal parser must be able to access such a list.

   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

6. Choosing values from lists

   It is RECOMMENDED that text values be chosen from "authoritative
   naming lists" whenever possible.  Doing this, the publisher will
   increase the level of machine readability and thus increase the
   accumulated global value of all iCalendar/SKICal objects.  It is
   expected that such lists will become widely available and accessible
   online, possibly in the RDF [11] or XML-Schema format.

7. Security considerations

   Anybody could produce a SKICal compliant file containing false
   information.  Calendar  publishers will need to exercize caution, or
   they may end up publishing invalid information.  Security can be
   achieved either by choosing to index SKICal files only from trusted
   servers, or by employing a moderator who can correct or refuse
   corrupt information.  Nobody should consider information from non-
   encrypted SKICal files 100% reliable, just as nobody SHOULD blindly
   trust printed advertisements or email.

   SKiSource organizers and publishers should be aware of legal
   implications from spreading personal information in electronic media.

8. Communication protocol

   The definitive method for interchanging SKiCal data between
   directories/calendars will probably be an extension to the Calendar
   Access Protocol CAP [4].  Since, as of this writing, CAP not yet
   published as an RFC, the process of extending it has not begun.
   Meanwhile, a simplistic approach is being used to synchronize
   existing SKICal databases over HTTP.

   Typically an organization wants to copy all SKICal data from certain
   SKICal databases.  In our simplistic solution we have two methods for
   this:

   1.  SKICal files are stored in a web accessible directory (which is
   basically a webpage with links to .ics files).  All files are fetched
   every time a synchronization needs to be made, they are parsed and
   all objects with a CREATED or LAST-MODIFIED value newer than the time
   of the previous synchronization are copied into the database.
   (Either automatically, or after review by an editor.)

   2.  A cgi program accepting one parameter, named 'since', returns a
   SKICal file containing all SKICal objects having a CREATED or LAST-
   MODIFIED value newer than local time 00:00:01 at the date indicated
   by the 'since' parameter.  The format of the 'since' parameter is
   YYYY-MM-DD.  (Eg.  2001-09-18 for September 18th 2001.)

   Obviously these methods are not economic, neither in terms of
   bandwidth usage or processing power.  The filtering of SKICal objects
   is left to the application since there is no way to limit your
   selection.  You might for example want to get all SKICal objects
   related to "sports".  Such selection mechanisms will appear in a
   later specification.

   In order to facilitate the creation of intelligent SKICal
   applications, though, it is RECOMMENDED that cgi export programs also
   implement the 'skuid' parameter.  A call (HTTP GET) to the cgi
   program with the 'skuid' value set should return a single SKICal
   object identified by that SKUID value, if there is such an object in
   the database.  A response other than a valid SKICal file from the cgi
   program should be interpreted as "no such object".
