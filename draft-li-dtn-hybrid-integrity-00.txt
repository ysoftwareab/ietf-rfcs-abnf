Abstract

   Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) is designed for a severe
   environment where communication quality is not guaranteed. It works
   as an overlay network associated with Bundle Protocol (BP) and some
   convergence layer protocols like Licklider Transmission Protocol
   (LTP). However, there is no mechanism in both BP and LTP Protocol to
   ensure integrity of a packet with the granularity of bit. Since the
   integrity is crucial for packet transmission and necessary metadata
   consumes extra costs, there should be a strategy to decide which
   packets and how the packets are required to conduct integrity
   assurance based on the network resources. Hence, in this document, a
   hybrid integrity assurance strategy is proposed to ensure the
   different levels of integrity of bundles based on different
   environments.

1. Introduction

   Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) [RFC4838] is designed for
   a severe environment where connectivity of network is intermittent
   and communication quality is not guaranteed. It works as an overlay
   network associated with Bundle Protocol (BP) [RFC5050] and
   convergence layer protocols like Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP)
   [RFC5325] [RFC5326]. BP, which is an application layer protocol, is
   based on a custody transfer mechanism and defines how to forward
   bundles in DTN, while LTP ensures the reliability of bundle
   transmission with the granularity of packet. However, there is no
   mechanism in both BP and LTP Protocol to ensure integrity of a packet
   with the granularity of bit. Integrity is crucial for packet
   transmission since errors in the header leads to some unexpected
   results while errors in the payload results in end-to-end
   retransmission and waste of limited storing and link resources.

   SBSP [I-D.birrane-dtn-sbsp-00] defines a streamlined bundle security
   protocol, which provides data integrity, authentication, and
   confidentiality services for the Bundle Protocol. However, necessary
   checksum metadata consumes costs, so there should be a strategy to
   decide which packets and how the packets are required to conduct
   integrity assurance based on the network resources, such as buffer
   utilization rate, bandwidth, and packet loss rate.

   In this document, we define a new type of extension block to carry
   the checksum information. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid integrity
   assurance strategy to ensure the different levels of integrity of
   bundles based on different environments.

3. Checksum Block Format

   There are three parts in bundle packet, primary block, payload block,
   and extension block. Extension Block is designed to carry additional
   information that DTN nodes can use to make processing decisions
   regarding bundles.

   We define a new type of extension block and use it to carry the
   checksum information in this document, and the basic format is based
   on [RFC6258], which defines DTN metadata extension block.

   The structure of checksum block is as follows:

   Checksum Block Format:

       +------+-------+-------------------------------------------+
       | Type | Flags | Length |Class of Resource|Type of Checksum|
       |      | (SDNV)| (SDNV) |     (SDNV)      |     (SDNV)     |
       +------+----------------+-----------------+----------------+
       |                        Checksum                          |
       |                                                          |
       +----------------------------------------------------------+

                                Figure 1

   o Block type code (1 byte) - defined in all bundle protocol blocks
      except the primary bundle block (as described in the Bundle
      Protocol). The block-type code for checksum is 0x20.

   o Block processing control flags (SDNV) - defined in all bundle
      protocol blocks except the primary bundle block. SDNV encoding is
      described in the Bundle Protocol. The following block processing
      control flag MUST be set "4 - Discard block if it can't be
      processed", which means that if a bundle node receives a bundle
      with a checksum block and it is not capable of supporting the
      checksum block, it just discards this block without processing it.

   o Block data length (SDNV) - defined in all bundle protocol blocks
      except the primary bundle block. SDNV encoding is described in the
      Bundle Protocol.

   o Bundle's class of resource (SDNV) - (CoR) indicates the bundle's
      class of resource, which decides whether a bundle packet should
      conduct an integrity assurance and which part should be detected.
      For now, it contains two types: 00 = inadequate, 01 = adequate,
      and will be extended in the future.

   o Type of Checksum (SDNV) - (ToC) indicates the type of checksum
      data. For now, it contains four types: 00 = checksum of primary
      block, 01 = checksum of payload block, 10 = checksum of primary
      block and payload block, 11 = no checksum of either primary block
      or payload block.

   o Checksum data - contains the raw checksum data itself, which is
      generated by some algorithms.



4. Processing Rules of Integrity Detection

   As is discussed in [WOOD08] and [I-D.templin-dtnhiaps-00], integrity
   detection is required on intermediate nodes in addition to
   destination nodes. In order to make full use of the limited resources
   in the severe environments, both the source nodes and the
   intermediate nodes should monitor the usage rate of their resources
   such as the storage and link. Then different integrity assurance
   strategies will be made according to resources. Besides, intermediate
   nodes detect the header/primary block or the payload block according
   to the Type of Checksum field carried in the checksum block. If there
   are errors in the packet data, forwarding is stopped and
   retransmission is called. When the destination nodes receive packets,
   they detect the checksum block and if there are errors in the packet
   data, retransmission will be called.

                                Figure 2

   The processing rules in source nodes are shown in Figure 2. The
   source nodes collect the network link status, such as bandwidth and
   packet loss rate, and create Class of Resource (CoR). The algorithm
   of creating CoR is not discussed here.

   If CoR=00 (inadequate), it means the network environment is severe
   and error prone. The source nodes read Bundle Processing Control
   Flags (defined in RFC5050). If custody is needed, Type of Checksum
   (ToC) will be set 10 (checksum of primary block and payload block),
   and the checksum of primary block and payload block will be computed
   by a designated algorithm. The algorithm is not discussed here. Then
   the Checksum data field will be filled. If custody is not needed, ToC
   will be set 00 (checksum of primary block), and the checksum of
   primary block will be computed. Then the Checksum data field will be
   filled.

   If CoR=01 (adequate), it means the network resources are relatively
   adequate. If custody is needed, ToC will be set 01 (checksum of
   payload block), and the checksum of payload block will be computed.
   Then the Checksum data field will be filled. If custody is not needed,
   ToC will be set 11 (no checksum of either primary block or payload
   block), no checksum calculation actions will be triggered. At last,
   the processed packets will queue and wait to be forwarded.

   Here, CoR is not only for describing the network resources, but also
   reserved for user-based strategies in the future work.

   If ToC = 00 (checksum of primary block), the primary block (header)
   will be checked. If ToC = 10(checksum of primary block and payload
   block), storage space will be detected and if free storage is more
   than 50%, the primary block will be checked. If free storage is less
   than 50%, both the primary block and the payload block will be
   checked. If ToC = 01 (checksum of payload block), storage space will
   be detected and if free storage is less than 50%, the payload block
   will be checked. If errors are detected, retransmission will be
   called. If no errors are detected, or ToC = 11 (no checksum of either

   related blocks will be checked by a designated algorithm. If errors
   are detected, retransmission will be called. If no errors are
   detected, or ToC is 11, the received packets will be regarded as
   acceptable and be cached and stored in local.



5. Security Considerations

   The Multi-strategy Based Payload Integrity Assurance method provides
   data integrity service for the Bundle Protocol, which is a necessary
   aspect of security problems.

   The proposed method can suit with the Payload Integrity Block (PIB)
   and Bundle Authentication Block (BAB) in Bundle Security Protocol
   [RFC6257].



6. IANA Considerations

   This specification allocates a codepoint from the "Bundle Block
   Types" registry defined in [RFC6255].

   Additional Entry for the Bundle Block Type Codes Registry:

               +-------+---------------+--------------+
               | Value | Description   |  Reference   |
               +--------------------------------------+
               |   20  |Checksum Block | This document|
               +-----------------------+--------------+

7. Conclusions

   The hybrid integrity assurance strategy proposed in this document
   describes how to ensure the different levels of integrity of bundles
   based on different environments.

   User-based integrity detection strategies and an effective checksum
   computing method that can improve effective load ratio will be
   proposed in the future work.
