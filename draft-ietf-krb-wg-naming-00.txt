Abstract

   This document defines new naming constraints for reserved Keberos
   names.  Names can be reserved for either the Kerberos principal name
   or the Kerberos realm name.  The reserved names defined in this
   document are critical: if a reserved name is unknown, authentication
   MUST fail.

Internet-Draft               Kerberos Naming                   June 2006


1.  Introduction

   Occasionally protocol designers need to designate a Kerberos
   principal name name or a Kerberos realm name to have special
   meanings, other than identifying a particular instance.  An example
   is that the protocol designers for the Kerberos anonymity support
   [ANON] need to define the Kerberos anonymous principal name and the
   Kerberos anonymous realm name, such that the anonymous name pair
   conveys no more meaning than that the client's identity is not
   revealed.  In that case, it is critical that deployed Kerberos
   implementations MUST fail the authentication so that no access can be
   accidentally granted to a principal who's name happens to match with
   that of the anonymous identity.

   However Kerberos as defined in [RFC4120] does not have such reserved
   name spaces.  As such, protocol designers have resolved to use
   exceedingly-unlikely-to-have-been-used names to avoid collision.
   Even if a registry can be setup to avoid collision for new
   implementations, there is no collision-free guarantee for deployed
   implementations.  Accidental reuse of names can result in a security
   weakness.

   The Kerberos realm name has a reserved name space but none is defined
   and the criticality of unknown reserved realm names is not
   sufficiently specified.

   This document is to remedy that by defining the reserved name spaces
   for Kerberos names and these names are critical so that
   authentication MUST fail if an unknown reserved name is used by
   conforming implementations.


2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Definitions

   In this section, reserved names are defined for both the kerberos
   principal name and the kerberos realm name.

3.1.  Reserved Kerberos Principal Names

   A new name type is defined for the reserved principal name as defined
   in Section 6.2 of [RFC4120].

            KRB_NT_RESRVED                                 16

   The reserved principal name MUST have at least two or more
   KerberosString components, and the first component must be the string
   literal "RESERVED".

   For implementations conforming with this specification,
   authentication MUST fail with
   KRB_AP_ERR_RESERVED_PRINCIPAL_NAME_UNKNOWN if an unknown reserved
   principal name is used.  There is no accompanying error data for this
   error.

            KRB_AP_ERR_RESERVED_PRINCIPAL_NAME_UNKNOWN     82
                 -- a reserved Kerberos principal name is unknown

3.2.  Reserved Kerberos Realm Names

   A new reserved realm name type is defined.  This new name type is
   defined as the "other" style of the realm names as defined in Section
   6.1 of [RFC4120].

            other: RESERVED:real-name

   Namely the reserved realm names start with the literal "RESERVED:"

   For implementations conforming with this specification,
   authentication MUST fail with KRB_AP_ERR_RESERVED_REALM_NAME_UNKNOWN
   if an unknown reserved realm name is used.  There is no accompanying
   error data for this error.

            KRB_AP_ERR_RESERVED_REALM_NAME_UNKNOWN         83
                 -- a reserved Kerberos realm name is unknown


4.  Security Considerations

   If a reserved name is unknown, authentication MUST fail, otherwise,
   access can be granted unintentionally, resulting in a security
   weakness.

   Care MUST be taken to avoid accidental reuse of names.


5.  Acknowledgements

   with Clifford Newman and Sam Hartman.
