1.  Introduction

   Cyberspace resources are the sum of various elements in cyberspace,
   such as medium, information and subject, covering not only the
   Internet infrastructure physical resources such as communication
   infrastructure, IP network, overlay network, application support
   system, but also the virtual resources such as information content
   and users hosted on physical facilities.

   Cyberspace mapping, in accordance with certain methods, techniques
   and standards, uses software or hardware tools to recognize the
   compositions, behaviors and development rules of cyberspace by
   testing multiple indicators characterizing the state, attributes and
   relationships of various layers of cyberspace.  The range of mapping
   could be local or global in cyberspace.  The objects to be measured
   include the composition, structure, attributes, behaviors,
   characteristics, rules and trends of cyberspace.  The information
   obtained by measurement is a kind of typical big data, enjoying the
   characteristics of diverse content formats, complex structures and
   rapid updating, thus brings great difficulty to the understanding,
   interaction and communication of mapping information.  Meanwhile,
   there are many existing measurement methods, and each has its own
   advantages and disadvantages.  Therefore, the measurement methods
   must be selected and combined in measuring cyberspace resources, and

Internet-Draft      Cyberspace Resources Measurement      September 2019


   the principles of rationality, practicability, scalability and
   comparability should be followed during the method selection.

   Rationality refers to whether the selected method could objectively
   measure the effect of cyberspace resources measurement, whether it
   could cover all aspects of cyberspace resources, and whether it could
   highlight the characteristics and focus of cyberspace measurement.
   Applicability requires consideration of data source and development
   situation of the measurement object itself during measurement methods
   selection.  Scalability refers to the development and variability of
   measurement methods, embodied in two aspects, i.e., the scalability
   of index system and the scalability of indexes used in measurement.
   Comparability refers to the method could be used to measure different
   cyberspace resources and mapping results in different periods.  The
   establishment of measurement index system is the first priority in
   cyberspace resources measurement.  Based on the existing information
   economy measurement, geographic information measurement and
   statistical theory and methods, a three-level measurement index
   system is developed in the draft in combination of the principles and
   mechanisms research of cyberspace resources mapping, as well as the
   research on cyberspace resources measurement methods.  Domain expert
   knowledge and original information are comprehensively considered to
   calculate and determine the weighting factors of measurement
   indicators in the draft.

   Originated from satisfying the basic requirements of cyberspace
   resources mapping, this draft standard adopts a multi-level
   hierarchical index system, and focuses on the unified regulations of
   calculating measurement weights of cyberspace resources.

2.  Terminology and Definition

2.1.  Terminology and Definition

   The following terms and definitions apply to this document.

   Cyberspace

   Cyberspace is a combination of virtual and physical space where human
   beings use information facilities to construct, realize information
   interaction, and then influence human thoughts and behaviors.  It
   relies on the carriers of information and communication technology
   infrastructure such as the Internet, telecommunication network and
   various control systems and devices.

   Cyberspace resource

Internet-Draft      Cyberspace Resources Measurement      September 2019


   Cyberspace resources refer to the entities that could be detected and
   perceived though cyberspace means, including resources on various
   types of networks such as the Internet, telecommunication network and
   industrial control network.  Specifically, cyberspace resources
   include physical devices such as network infrastructure and network
   access, information resources and network services such as audio,
   video, websites and text data, and network avatars and IP-based
   various telecommunication network devices and industrial control
   systems.

   Entity

   Entities are interdependent networks of information technology
   infrastructure, including computers, communication network systems,
   information systems, embedded processors, controllers, and the data
   held therein.

   Virtual entity

   Virtual entities are virtual resources that cover information content
   and users carried on network entity, including various types of
   network accounts.

   Mapping entity

   By designing an effective positioning algorithm and association
   analysis method, the virtual entity resource is mapped to the social
   space, that is, the subject behind the virtual entity is the
   corresponding mapping entity.

   Cyberspace resource measurement

   The cyberspace resource measurement refers to the quantitative
   calculation of the detectable attributes of cyberspace resources
   under a certain scale.

   Measure space

   The attribute set of the resource t_p is X, A represents the complete
   set of resource t_p , and S represents the measure of resource t_p.
   The triple (X, A, S) is the measure space of cyberspace resource t_p.

   Indicator

   The indicator is a concept that describes the characteristics of
   cyberspace resources.  It embodies the quality and quantity
   prescriptiveness of substance.

Internet-Draft      Cyberspace Resources Measurement      September 2019


   Indicator system

   Indicator system refers to the organism composed of several
   interconnected statistical indicators, which is the premise and basis
   for conducting prediction or evaluation research.  It decomposes the
   abstract research object into behavioral, operational structure
   according to sign of its essential attributes and characteristics,
   and the process of assigning weights to each of the constituent
   elements (ie, indicators) in the indicator system.

   Weight

   In the field of mathematics, weight refers to the frequency of each
   of the weighted averages, also known as weight number or weight
   function.  In the measurement of cyberspace resources, weight
   represents the importance of cyberspace measurement indicators.

   Information entropy

   In information theory, entropy is the average of the information
   contained in each received message, also known as information
   entropy, source entropy, and average self-information.  Information
   entropy could be understood as a measure of uncertainty, the larger
   value of entropy, the more random distribution of sources.  In the
   measurement of cyberspace resources, information entropy could be
   used to describe the uncertainty of resource attributes in network
   measurements.

3.  Basic principles of Measurement Standards

   There are many existing measurement methods, and each has its own
   advantages and disadvantages.  Therefore, the measurement methods
   must be selected and combined in measuring cyberspace resources.
   Certain principles should be followed during the measurement methods



Chen, et al.             Expires March 26, 2020                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft      Cyberspace Resources Measurement      September 2019


   selection, and according to this standard, the following principles
   should be followed.

3.1.  Rationality principle

   If a measurement method could be widely used and developed, its
   scientific nature must be recognized, and it has been tested by
   predecessors.  This standard merely selects and combines among many
   measurement methods, and gives a measurement method suitable for
   cyberspace resources.  Therefore, the scientific nature of the
   selected measurement method could be ignored.  Different measurement
   objects are suitable for different measurement methods, thus the
   rationality of the measurement method is an important principle that
   must be considered.  The so-called rationality here refers to whether
   the selected method could objectively measure the effect of
   cyberspace resources measurement, whether it could cover all aspects
   of cyberspace resources, and whether it could highlight the
   characteristics and focus of cyberspace measurement.

3.2.  Applicability principle

   Although the measurement effect of cyberspace resources belongs to
   the category of measurement metrics, it also has its particularity.
   First, it is a measurement of the macro category.  This makes the
   source of the measurement data must be of recognized or officially
   recognized statistics.  Secondly, the effectiveness measurement of
   cyberspace resources measurement is still in the exploratory stage.
   Currently a lot of data is not available, some data could merely be
   partially obtained, and some data could not be guaranteed to be
   correct.  Therefore, the data source should be taken into
   consideration, and choose the applicable measurement method.
   Applicability principle requires that the choice of the measurement
   method should consider the data source and the development of the
   measurement object itself.  Applicability requires consideration of
   data source and development situation of the measurement object
   itself during measurement methods selection.

   Some methods seem to be rigorous, but lacking operability in use.
   Some indicator systems are very complex and involve all aspects, but
   could not be implemented because of lacking data.  Importantly, due
   to the universal connection between things, some aspects of data may
   have the same revealing effect as the data in other aspects.  If the
   indicator system is too complicated and the data source is too
   excessive, it will cover up the essence and is not conducive to
   measurement.  Therefore, the indicator system should not be
   complicated, the design of the indicator system should consider the
   relationship between the indicators, and the formulation of the
   indicator items should consider the availability of data.

Internet-Draft      Cyberspace Resources Measurement      September 2019


3.3.  Scalability principle

   Scalability refers to the development and variability of measurement
   method.  In effectiveness measurement of cyberspace, scalability is
   embodied in two aspects.  One is the scalability of the indicator
   system.  The development of cyberspace mapping should be considered,
   and in the early stage of effectiveness measurement of cyberspace
   resources, the indicator system could be relatively rough, reflecting
   the main aspects of cyberspace measurement.  The second is the
   scalability of the indicators used in the measurement.  The designed
   indicator system might be relatively complete.  However, in the
   implementation process, the indicators with strong operability could
   be selected for investigation and measurement, and indicators could
   be gradually expanded when the data is available.  This principle is
   also in line with the proposed cyberspace resource measurement life
   cycle theory.  Step by step, increase the dimensions and items of the
   measure.  The organic combination of various methods in the practical
   measurement process is not simply using a certain method, but
   integrating the applicable various methods to form a new method
   system.

3.4.  Comparability principle

   The measurement is a global and holistic measurement of the object
   system described by the multi-attribute architecture.  According to
   the characteristics of a complex system affected by multi-factors
   simultaneously, when considering the relevant factors
   comprehensively, the complex system is based on multiple relevant
   indicators.  Measurement results need to be compared, and there are
   comparisons between different mapping methods, and comparisons of
   different periods and different regions of a certain measurement
   method.  The purpose of comparison is to better understand the
   cyberspace resources, analyze their advantages and disadvantages, and
   then develop countermeasures for cyberspace mapping.  To achieve the
   goal of comparison, measurement methods must be of universality and
   standardization characteristics, which can be used to measure
   different cyberspace resources and mapping results in different
   periods.

4.  Cyberspace resources measurement indicators and methods

   According to the state, structure and behavior characteristics of
   resources in different levels of cyberspace, this draft divides the
   measurement of cyberspace resources into two categories: entity
   resources measurement and virtual resources measurement, which are
   respectively used to measure the dominant and partially recessive
   characteristics of resources at different levels.

4.1.  Measurement index system

   The establishment of measurement index system is the first priority
   in cyberspace resources measurement.  This draft, based on the
   existing information economy measurement, geographic information
   measurement and statistical theory and methods, combines the
   principles of and mechanisms research of cyberspace resources
   mapping, as well as the research on cyberspace resources measurement
   methods.

   There are 26 indicators in the third level, wherein the physical
   information measurement including geographic information measurement,
   affiliated measurement, and device information measurement;
   topological measurement including topological common measurement,
   autonomous domain topology measurement, router topology measurement,
   IP level topology measurement; node measurement including node common
   measurement and performance measurement; network service measurement
   including service common measurement, P2P measurement, HTTP
   measurement, FTP measurement, VPN measurement; security measurement
   including encryption measurement, authentication measurement, patch
   measurement, vulnerability measurement, host security measurement;
   transmission measurement including information measurement and
   wireless measurement; the virtual subject measurement including
   account measurement, common measurement, and group measurement; and
   the projected entity measurement including common measurement and
   group measurement.

   The resource measurement index of each leaf level is composed by
   measurement index name, measurement data type, measurement value
   domain, normalized measurement value, and subjective index weight
   value, and the resource measurement index of the non-leaf level is
   composed by measurement index name, measurement mathematical symbol,
   measurement and subjective measurement weight.

4.2.  Measurement method

   Measurement is quantitative calculation of an attribute under certain
   scale.

   The scale is determined by people's experience in observing objective
   things, and it is not absolutely invariable.  So, in order to
   determine the measurement, the scale should be specified first.
   Comprehensive measurement is a global and holistic measurement of the
   object system described by multi-attribute architecture.  That is,
   according to the characteristic that a complex system is affected by
   multi-factors simultaneously, when considering the relevant factors
   comprehensively, the complex system is based on multiple relevant
   indicators.

   From a mathematical point of view, measurement theory is a branch of
   real analysis.  The research object includes algebra, measurement,
   measurable function and integral.  It assigns a number to some subset
   of a given set, and this number could be compared to size, volume,
   probability, etc.  This draft gives a mathematical definition of
   measurement in order to derive the measurement definition of
   cyberspace resources.

   The measure (the positive measure that can be added) is a function.
   The element set is a sub-set of X, and is a algebra.  The measure is
   defined on A, takes a range of values zero to infinity.

   The measurement of empty set is zero.

   Such triples (X, A, S) are called a measurement space, and elements
   in A are called measurable sets in this space.  The draft gives a
   definition of measurement S of cyberspace resources based on the
   mathematical definition of measurement.  Define cyberspace as T,
   there is a certain network resource t_p belongs to T, then the
   attribute set of the resource t_p is X.  The n-th measurement results
   of the resource t_p are defined as A={a_1,a_2...}, and a certain
   detection result is a_i belongs to A, and S is a measurement of
   cyberspace resource t_p.  Therefore, the measurement space of
   cyberspace resource t_p is (X, A, S).

   The detection result set a_i of the resource t_p includes j
   measurement index attributes, wherein the measurement index
   attributes are divided into two categories: numerical type and symbol
   type.  Since the dimensions, magnitude, and index of each indicator
   have different positive and negative orientations, the initial data
   needs to be normalized.

   In summary, the value of the normalized index m_ji is [0, 1].  Since
   the measurement indicators of cyberspace resources are of different
   significance, some indicators could well represent the resource, but
   some indicators are not characteristic attributes of the resource.
   It is necessary to evaluate the importance of the measurement index,
   and the importance of the indicator is the measurement weight W.

   The methods for determining the weight of indicators mainly include
   subjective weighting method and objective weighting method.  The
   subjective weighting method is a kind of method that determines the
   weight according to the evaluator's subjective importance to each
   index.  The original weighting method based on the objective
   weighting method comes from the objective environment, and it is
   based on the amount of information provided by each indicator and
   determines the weight of indicator.  According to the idea of

   decision-making is one of the determinants of the accuracy and
   reliability of decision-making.  It is generally believed that the
   higher the information entropy value, the more balanced the system
   structure, the smaller the difference, or the slower the change;
   conversely, the lower the information entropy, the more unbalanced
   the system structure, the greater the difference, or the faster the
   change.  Therefore, the weight could be calculated according to the
   magnitude of the entropy, that is, the variation degree of each index
   value.

   The calculation of the measurement weight W in this draft
   comprehensively considers subjective factors and objective factors.
   The weight W of the measurement index is equal to the subjective
   weighting (domain expert) multiplied by the objective weighting
   (information entropy) to determine the weighting coefficient of the
   measurement index.  Among them, the weights given by the domain
   experts represent the prior knowledge, and the weights given by the
   information entropy represent the objective measurement results.
   Therefore, the weight W of the measure is equal to:

   The calculation process of objective weighting W_o is given below.
   Assuming that the measurement indices are independent random
   variables, then the information entropy of the index is Shannon
   information theory.

   Obviously, the range of objective weighting is W_o belongs to [0,1],
   so the index weight W belongs to [0,1].  Then according to the index
   system layering, the level 3 measurement formula is sum up of W
   multiply by m.

   Obviously, the range of the measure S^k is S belongs to [0,1], and
   the calculation formula of the level 1 and level 2 is W multiply by
   S.
