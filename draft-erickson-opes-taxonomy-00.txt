 Abstract 
  
    This document presents the different models for deployment of OPES 
    boxes.  This document will attempt to clarify the different 
    owners/users of an OPES box in order to provide a framework for 
    discussing our observed services, trust relationships and working 
    environments.  Hopefully, this document will give a common framework 
    for discussing and defining policy issues for networks using OPES 
    boxes.

 Internet Draft          OPES Network Taxonomy           February 2001 
  
 1. Introduction 
    There have been several example uses of OPES boxes (e.g. those found in 
    draft-beck-opes-esfnep-01.txt) that often imply very different 
    operating environments for the OPES box.  In general, the current 
    working model of the Internet would place proxy boxes under four 
    different owners (and therefore three different usage models).   
     
    The primary owners identified are:  Content Provider (or origin 
    websites), Content Delivery Networks (CDN), Clients, and of course 
    ISPÆs providing both access for a client and hosting for a Content 
    Provider.  Here is a diagram of this framework. 
     
     
    <========= Content Oriented   #   Browser Oriented ================> 
                                  #   
    +----------+    +---------+   #   +-------------+    +-------------+ 
    | Content  |    |   CDN   |   #   |    Access   |    |   Client    | 
    | Provider |--->|         |---#-->|     ISP     |--->|             | 
    |          |    |         |   #   |             |    |             | 
    |(web      |<---| (cache  |<--#---|(cache       |<---|(fwd         | 
    | srv)(rev |    |  arrays)|   #   | arrays)(fwd |    | pxy) (client| 
    |      pxy)|    |         |   #   |         pxy)|    |        apps)| 
    +----------+    +---------+   #   +-------------+    +-------------+ 
                                  #   
    INBOUND  <====================#=======================>   OUTBOUND 
     
     
    Any of the proxy or cache boxes may be a OPES box, as well as several 
    boxes not shown û however, any others will most likely also be owned by 
    one of the 5 parties.   
     
    This diagram still does not show any possible remote callout servers 
    (e.g. iCAP servers) that may exist.  Also note that this shows 
    ownership rather than location û i.e. a CDN will often have cache 
    arrays co-located at an ISP.  And, of course, there are several 
    examples of a single entity playing multiple roles (e.g. AOL acting as 
    a Content Provider, Hosting ISP, CDN and Access ISP). 
     
    The dividing line represents a likely point of separation of services 
    being offered specifically for either the Client or Content Provider.  
    For instance, the Access ISP is likely to offer content filtering or 
    virus checking to their customers (the clients) where the Hosting ISP 
    or CDN would have no reason to offer these services, since their 
    customer would be the Content Provider.

 Internet Draft          OPES Network Taxonomy           February 2001 
  
    One other limitation is this diagram shows the Internet as it öisö, 
    rather than how it öwill beö (though, perhaps ômay beö would be a 
    better term).  In the future we will quite likely see a simpler model 
    more along the lines of cable television, with a small set of Content 
    Providers, and companies acting as both distributors and access 
    provider, and in fact even owning the browsing equipment for the 
    client.  This would, in fact, look more like this: 
           
    +----------+ 
    | +----------+            +------------------------------------+ 
    | | +----------+          |            Distributor             | 
    | | | Content  |          |                         +------+   | 
    | | | Provider |--------->| (rev   (cache    (fwd   |+------+  | 
    | | |          |          |  pxy)   arrays)   pxy)  +|+------+ | 
    | | |(web      |<---------|                          +|client| | 
    +-| | srv)(rev |          |                           +------+ | 
      +-|      pxy)|          +------------------------------------+ 
        +----------+ 
     
     
    In any event, this represents a fairly complete set of possible proxy-
    points where an OPES extension could be installed.

 2. OPES Use 
    Now that there is a breakdown of the concerned parties, the services 
    that each OPES box owner will likely use or provide can be identified.  
    The following table shows the example services provided by draft-beck-
    opes-esfnep-01.txt, and the parties that would likely offer them: 
     
                                   Content    CDN        Access     Client

    This table was built using the following assumptions about the concerns 
    and priorities of the owners of the OPES boxes. 
     
 2.1 Content Provider and Hosting ISP 
    OPES Boxes owned by the Content Provider or the Hosting ISP will most 
    likely be under the Content ProviderÆs control, or will at least be 
    providing services for the Content Provider.  
     
 2.2 CDN Service 
    OPES Boxes owned by the CDN (or a set of CDNÆs in a peering 
    relationship) will be setup to handle content for their customers (the 
    content providers), and therefore will probably have features for the 
   
 Erickson                 Expires August 2001                 [Page 5] 
                                     
 Internet Draft          OPES Network Taxonomy           February 2001 
  
    content providers, along with any service they can add for the CDNÆs 
    own revenue.   
     
 2.3 Access ISP 
    Currently, it is unlikely that OPES Boxes owned by an Access ISP would 
    provide services for the Content Provider (or CDN), due to the 
    proliferation of ISPÆs and the large number of service agreements that 
    would have to be reached.   
     
    Therefore, the Access ISP will be using OPES boxes for services for 
    their own revenue (Ad banners), and for services they could provide 
    their customers (Virus Scanning, Filtering, et al), but also for 
    services they could provide selected content providers (Bandwidth 
    adaptation, Regional data, User profiles, et al).   
     
 2.4 Client 
    OPES Boxes owned by the ClientÆs themselves (primarily corporate 
    enterprises, libraries, internet cafes, etc) will offer services 
    oriented only towards the clients.  
     
 2.5 Proposed Questions 
    The document was created primarily to setup a framework for discussing 
    OPES services and how they would be used.  However, here are a few of 
    the questions do present themselves: 
     
    1.     What trust relationships must exist? 
           . Are all modules loaded by an administration box controlled by 
              the OPES box owner. 
           .  
    2.     What security measures must exist? 
         . If security measures (such as AAA) are in place, to whom are we
           providing secure access for?  Only the owner of the box, or 
           would other trusted parties have access? 
    3.   Is there any limit on functionality for proxylets from outside  
         sources? 
         . Sandboxing a java-based proxylet to disallow file access or 
           socket connections. 
         . Disallowing access to remote callout servers outside of the 
           domain. 
    4.   Are there other frameworks that are currently in place or soon 
         will be? 
    5.   How do we provide standardized accounting across ownership 
         domains? 
         . E.g. an ISP or CDN providing æpage hitÆ counts to a Content 
           Provider. 
         . E.g. the usage of an OPES proxylet. 
         . Would this simply be a set of services implemented on OPES, or 
           must OPES address this directly?  Perhaps a set of services 
           could be provided by OPES to facilitate accounting.
