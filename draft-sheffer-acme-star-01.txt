Use of Short-Term, Automatically-Renewed (STAR) Certificates to Delegate
                        Authority over Web Sites
                       draft-sheffer-acme-star-01

Abstract

   This memo proposes two mechanisms that work in concert to allow a
   third party (e.g., a content delivery network) to terminate TLS
   sessions on behalf of a domain name owner (e.g., a content provider).

   The proposed mechanisms are:

   1.  An extension to the ACME protocol to enable the issuance of
       short-term and automatically renewed certificates, and
   2.  A protocol that allows a domain name owner to delegate to a third
       party control over a certificate that bears its own name.

   It should be noted that these are in fact independent building blocks
   that can be used separately to solve completely different problems.

1.  Introduction: A Solution for the HTTPS CDN Use Case

   A content provider (referred to in this document as Domain Name
   Owner, DNO) has agreements in place with one or more Content Delivery
   Networks (CDNs) that are contracted to serve its content over HTTPS.
   The CDN terminates the HTTPS connection at one of its edge cache
   servers and needs to present its clients (browsers, set-top-boxes) a
   certificate whose name matches the authority of the URL that is
   requested, i.e. that of the DNO.  However, many DNOs balk at sharing
   their long-term private keys with another organization and, equally,
   CDN providers would rather not have to handle other parties' long-
   term secrets.  This problem has been discussed at the IETF under the
   LURK (limited use of remote keys) title.

   This document proposes a solution to the above problem that involves
   the use of short-term certificates with a DNO's name on them, and a
   scheme for handling the naming delegation from the DNO to the CDN.
   The generated short-term credentials are automatically renewed by an
   ACME Certification Authority (CA) [I-D.ietf-acme-acme] and routinely
   rotated by the CDN on its edge cache servers.  The DNO can end the
   delegation at any time by simply instructing the CA to stop the
   automatic renewal and let the certificate expire shortly thereafter.

   Using short-term certificates makes revocation cheap and effective
   [Topalovic] [I-D.iab-web-pki-problems] in case of key compromise or
   of termination of the delegation; seamless certificate issuance and
   renewal enable the level of workflow automation that is expected in
   today's cloud environments.  Also, compared to other keyless-TLS
   solutions [I-D.cairns-tls-session-key-interface]
   [I-D.erb-lurk-rsalg], the proposed approach doesn't suffer from
   scalability issues or increase in connection setup latency, while
   requiring virtually no changes to existing COTS caching software used
   by the CDN.

1.1.  Terminology

   DNO  Domain Name Owner, the owner of a domain that needs to be

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

2.  Protocol Flow

   The protocol flow can be split into two: a STAR interface, used by
   CDN and DNO to agree on the name delegation, and the extended ACME
   interface, used by DNO to obtain the short-term and automatically
   renewed certificate from the CA, which is eventually consumed by the
   CDN.  The latter is also used to terminate the delegation, if so
   needed.

   The following subsections describe the preconditions (Section 2.1),
   and the three main phases of the protocol:

   o  Bootstrap: the CDN requests from the DNO the delegation of a
      specific name and in turn DNO asks an ACME CA to create the
      corresponding short-term and auto-renewed (STAR) certificate
      (Section 2.2);
   o  Auto-renewal: the ACME CA periodically re-issues the short-term
      certificate and posts it to a public URL (Section 2.3);
   o  Termination: the DNO (indirectly) stops name delegation by
      explicitly requesting the ACME CA to discontinue the automatic
      renewal of the certificate (Section 2.4).

2.1.  Preconditions

   The protocol assumes the following preconditions are met:

   o  A mutually authenticated channel between CDN and DNO pre-exists.
      This is called "STAR channel" and all STAR protocol exchanges
      between CDN and DNO are run over it.  It provides the guarantee
      that requests and responses are authentic.
   o  CDN and DNO have agreed on a "CSR template" to use, including at a
      minimum:

      -  Subject name (e.g., "somesite.example.com"),
      -  Validity (e.g., 24 to 72 hours),
      -  Requested algorithms,
      -  Key length,
      -  Key usage.

      The CDN is required to use this template for every CSR created
      under the same delegation.

   o  DNO has registered through the ACME interface exposed by the
      Certificate Authority (CA) using the usual ACME registration
      procedure.  In ACME terms, the DNO has an Account on the server
      and is ready to issue Orders.

2.2.  Bootstrap

   The CDN (STAR Client) generates a key-pair, wraps it into a
   Certificate Signing Request (CSR) according to the agreed upon CSR
   template, and sends it to the DNO (STAR Proxy) over the pre-
   established STAR channel.  The DNO uses the CDN identity provided on
   the STAR channel to look up the CSR template that applies to the
   requesting CDN and decides whether or not to accept the request.
   Assuming everything is in order, it then "forwards" the CDN request
   to the ACME CA by means of the usual ACME application procedure.
   Specifically, the DNO, in its role as an ACME client, requests the CA
   to issue a STAR certificate, i.e., one that:

   o  Has a short validity (e.g., 24 to 72 hours);
   o  Is automatically renewed by the CA for a certain period of time;
   o  Is downloadable from a (highly available) public link without
      requiring any special authorization.

   Other than that, the ACME protocol flows as normal between DNO and
   CA, in particular DNO is responsible for satisfying the requested
   ACME challenges until the CA is willing to issue the requested
   certificate.  Per normal ACME processing, the DNO is given back an
   Order ID for the issued STAR certificate to be used in subsequent
   interaction with the CA (e.g., if the certificate needs to be
   terminated.)

   Concurrently, a response is sent back to the CDN with an endpoint to
   poll for completion of the certificate generation process.

   The bootstrap phase ends when the DNO obtains the OK from the ACME CA
   and posts the certificate's URL to the "completion endpoint" where
   the CDN can retrieve it.

   The CA automatically re-issues the certificate (using the same CSR)
   before it expires and publishes it to the URL that the CDN has come
   to know at the end of the bootstrap phase.  The CDN downloads and
   installs it.  This process goes on until either:

2.4.  Termination

   The DNO may request early termination of the STAR certificate by
   including the Order ID in a certificate termination request to the
   ACME interface, defined below.  After the CA receives and verifies
   the request, it shall:

   o  Cancel the automatic renewal process for the STAR certificate;
   o  Change the certificate publication resource to return an error
      indicating the termination of the delegation to external clients,
      including the CDN.

   Note that it is not necessary to explicitly revoke the short-term
   certificate.

3.  Protocol Details

   This section describes the protocol's details.  We start with the
   STAR API between the STAR Client and the STAR Proxy.  Then we
   describe a few extensions to the ACME protocol running between the
   STAR Proxy and the ACME Server.

3.1.  STAR API

   This API allows the STAR Client to request a STAR certificate via the
   STAR Proxy, using a previously agreed-upon CSR template.

   The API consists of a single resource, "registration".  A new
   Registration is created with a POST request, and the Registration
   instance is polled to obtain its details.

3.1.1.  Creating a Registration

   To create a registration, use:









Sheffer, et al.         Expires October 27, 2017                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft                  ACME STAR                     April 2017


   POST /star/registration
   Host: star-proxy.example.net
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
       "csr": "...", // CSR in PEM format
       "lifetime": 365 // requested registration lifetime in days,
                       // between 1 and 1095
   }

   Upon success, the call returns the new Registration resource.

   HTTP/1.1 201 Created
   Location: https://star-proxy.example.net/star/registration/567

3.1.2.  Polling the Registration

   The returned Registration can be polled until the information is
   available from the ACME server.

   GET /star/registration/567
   Host: star-proxy.example.net

   In responding to poll requests while the validation is still in
   progress, the server MUST return a 200 (OK) response and MAY include
   a Retry-After header field to suggest a polling interval to the
   client.  The Retry-After value MUST be expressed in seconds.  If the
   Retry-After header is present, in order to avoid surprising
   interactions with heuristic expiration times, a max-age Cache-Control
   SHOULD also be present and set to a value slightly smaller than the
   Retry-After value.

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Retry-After: 10
   Cache-Control: max-age=9

   {
       "status": "pending"
   }

   When the operation is successfully completed, the ACME Proxy returns:

Internet-Draft                  ACME STAR                     April 2017


HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Expires: Sun, 09 Sep 2018 14:09:00 GMT

{
    "status": "valid", // or "failed"
    "lifetime": 365, // lifetime of the registration in days,
                     //  possibly less than requested
    "certificates": "https://acme-server.example.org/certificates/A51A3"
}

   The Expires header applies to the Registration resource itself, and
   may be as small as a few minutes.  It is unrelated to the Order's
   lifetime which is measured in days or longer.  The "certificates"
   attribute contains a URL of the certificate pull endpoint, see
   Section 3.4.

   If the registration fails for any reason, the server returns a "200
   OK" response, with the status as "failed" and a "reason" attribute
   containing a human readable error message.

3.2.  Transport Security for the STAR Protocol Leg

   Traffic between the STAR Client and the STAR Proxy MUST be protected
   with HTTPS.  For interoperability, all implementations MUST support
   HTTP Basic Authentication [RFC7617].  However some deployments MAY
   prefer mutually- authenticated HTTPS or two-legged OAUTH.

3.3.  ACME Extensions between Proxy and Server

   This protocol extends the ACME protocol, to allow for recurrent
   orders.

3.3.1.  Extending the Order Resource

   The Order resource is extended with the following attributes:

 {
     "recurrent": true,
     "recurrent-total-lifetime": 365, // requested lifetime of the
                                      // recurrent registration, in days
     "recurrent-certificate-validity": 7
        // requested validity of each certificate, in days
 }

   These attributes are included in a POST message when creating the
   order, as part of the "payload" encoded object.  They are returned
   when the order has been created, and the ACME server MAY adjust them
   at will, according to its local policy.

Internet-Draft                  ACME STAR                     April 2017


3.3.2.  Canceling a Recurrent Order

   An important property of the recurrent Order is that it can be
   cancelled by the domain name owner, with no need for certificate
   revocation.  We use the DELETE message to cancel the Order:

   DELETE /acme/order/1 HTTP/1.1
   Host: acme-server.example.org

   Which returns:

   HTTP/1.1 202 Deleted

   The server MUST NOT issue any additional certificates for this Order,
   beyond the certificate that is available for collection at the time
   of deletion.

3.3.3.  Indicating Support of Recurrent Orders

   ACME supports sending arbitrary extensions when creating an Order,
   and as a result, there is no need to explicitly indicate support of
   this extension.  The Proxy MUST verify that the "recurrent" attribute
   was understood, as indicated by the "recurrent" attribute included in
   the created Order.  Since the standard ACME protocol does not allow
   to explicitly cancel a pending Order (the DELETE operation above is
   an extension), a Proxy that encounters an non-supporting server will
   probably let the Order expire instead of following through with the
   authorization process.

3.4.  Fetching the Certificates

   The certificate is fetched from the certificate endpoint, as per
   [I-D.ietf-acme-acme], Sec. 7.4.2 "Downloading the Certificate".  The
   server MUST include an Expires header that indicates expiry of the
   specific certificate.  When the certificate expires, the client MAY
   assume that a newer certificate is already in place.

   A certificate MUST be replaced by its successor at the latest 24
   hours before its "Not After" time.

4.  CDNI Use Cases

   Members of the IETF CDNI (Content Delivery Network Interconnection)
   working group are interested in delegating authority over web content
   to CDNs.  Their requirements are described in a draft
   [I-D.fieau-cdni-https-delegation] that compares several solutions.
   This section discusses two particular requirements in the context of
   the STAR protocol.

Internet-Draft                  ACME STAR                     April 2017


4.1.  Multiple Parallel Delegates

   In some cases the DNO would like to delegate authority over a web
   site to multiple CDNs.  This could happen if the DNO has agreements
   in place with different regional CDNs for different geographical
   regions.  STAR enables this use case naturally, since each CDN can
   authenticate separately to the DNO specifying its CSR, and the DNO is
   free to allow or deny each certificate request according to its own
   policy.

4.2.  Chained Delegation

   In other cases, a content owner (DNO) delegates some domains to a
   large CDN (CDN1), which in turn delegates to a smaller regional CDN,
   CDN2.  The DNO has a contractual relationship with CDN1, and CDN1 has
   a similar relationship with CDN2.  However DNO may not even know
   about CDN2.

   The STAR protocol does not prevent this use case, although there is
   no special support for it.  CDN1 can forward requests from CDN2 to
   DNO, and forward responses back to CDN2.  Whether such proxying is
   allowed is governed by policy and contracts between the parties.

5.  Security Considerations

5.1.  STAR Protocol Authentication

   The STAR protocol allows its client to obtain certificates bearing
   the DNO's identity.  Therefore strong client authentication is
   mandatory.

   When multiple CDNs may connect to the same DNO, the STAR protocol's
   authentication must allow the DNO to distinguish between different
   CDNs.  Among other benefits, this allows to DNO to cancel a STAR
   registration for one of its clients instead of all of them.

5.2.  Restricting CDNs to the Delegation Mechanism

   Currently there are no standard methods for the DNO to ensure that
   the CDN cannot issue a certificate through mechanisms other than the
   one described here, for the URLs under the CDN's control.  For
   example, regardless of the STAR solution, a rogue CDN employee can
   use the ACME protocol (or proprietary mechanisms used by various CAs)
   to create a fake certificate for the DNO's content because ACME
   authorizes its requests using information that may be under the
   adversary's control.

   The best solution currently being worked on would consist of several
   related configuration steps:

   o  Make sure that the CDN cannot modify the DNS records for the
      domain.  Typically this would mean that the content owner
      establishes a CNAME resource record from a subdomain into a CDN-
      managed domain.
   o  Restrict certificate issuance for the domain to specific CAs that
      comply with ACME.  This assumes universal deployment of CAA
      [RFC6844] by CAs, which is not the case yet.  We note that the CA/
      Browser Forum has recently decided to require CAA checking
      [CAB-CAA].
   o  Deploy ACME-specific methods to restrict issuance to a specific
      authorization key which is controlled by the content owner
      [I-D.landau-acme-caa], and/or to specific ACME authorization
      methods.

   This solution is recommended in general, even if an alternative to
   the mechanism described here is used.
