Internet-Draft    Bounce Address Tag Validation (BATV)      January 2007


   Existing Internet mail permits unauthorized use of addresses in the
   MailFrom command, causing notices to be sent to unwitting and
   unwilling recipients.  Bounce Address Tag Validation (BATV) defines
   an extensible mechanism for validating the MailFrom address.  It also
   defines an initial use of that mechanism which requires no
   administrative overhead and no global implementation.

Internet-Draft    Bounce Address Tag Validation (BATV)      January 2007


1.  Introduction

   The envelope for Internet Mail may contain an address that is
   designated to receive transmission-related notifications.  It is
   specified in the RFC2821.MailFrom command.  The field is set by the
   RFC2822.Sender, acting as an agent of the message author specified in
   RFC2822.From.  However no portion of the MailFrom address is required
   to have any similarity to any portion of the From or Sender
   addresses, and valid usage scenarios do call for the MailFrom address
   to have no visible relationship to the From or Sender values.

   Further, existing Internet mail permits unauthorized use of addresses
   in the MailFrom command, which results in having notices sent to
   unwitting and unwilling recipients.  Therefore, the challenge is to
   distinguish legitimate uses from these unauthorized uses and to do
   this with a mechanism that incurs modest administration, operations
   and performance costs.

   Bounce Address Tag Validation (BATV) defines a framework for
   mechanisms that validate the value in this command.  Multiple
   validation methods are envisioned.  So BATV defines a common
   syntactic framework that enhances the local-part field of the
   MailFrom address.  An initial, specific validation scheme is also
   defined; it requires no administrative overhead and no global
   implementation.

   The <local-part> of an Internet mail address is a globally opaque
   string.  Hence, the specified modification to the local-part can be
   deployed in a manner that is entirely transparent to the public
   Internet mail service, except for mail system components within the
   scope of the MailFrom domain, and then only for components that
   process the MailFrom address local-part.  The result permits the
   MailFrom target domain to distinguish notification message addresses
   that are valid from those that are not.  Enhancements would permit
   processing agents that are along the original message's transfer path
   to determine whether the MailFrom adress is likely to be valid.  This
   assessment could aid in deciding whether to send a bounce message,
   thereby reducing the Internet mail infrastructure cost for
   transmitting notification messages in response to addresses used
   without permission.  It might even be used to detect invalid
   messages, thereby reducing Internet mail infrastructure cost for
   original messages.

   Terminology:  Terminology conforms to [I-D.email-arch]

      The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
      in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]


2.  Model

   BATV defines a method for tagging information to be included in the
   <local-part> of the RFC2821.MailFrom address.  This permits encoding
   information that authenticates the MailFrom.  Because the information
   is placed in MailFrom, rather than in an RFC2822 header, it sometimes
   is not as publicly visible as an RFC2822 header.  Tagging the
   MailFrom address rather than any of the RFC2822 addresses avoids
   problems arising from rewriting message headers that may be visible
   to recipients, and enables the validation process to operate within
   an SMTP session, before the contents of a message are transferred.

2.1.  Meta-Syntax

   BATV tagging is based on a meta-syntax that defines a field-oriented
   structure for an address local-part.  It permits use of a variety of
   address authentication methods, while supporting remote extraction of
   the core portion of the local-part, without having to understand the
   semantics of any particular scheme.

   NOTE:   BATV is for the purpose of detecting invalid RFC2821.MailFrom
      addresses.  Any BATV-related modifications that are made to the
      original MailFrom MUST preserve the result of returning valid
      bounces to the address originally specified in that MailFrom.

   The meta-syntax for MailFrom local-part is defined in Section 3.

2.2.  Tagging Schemes

   BATV permits alternative schemes.  To ensure interoperability among
   independent participants, other specifications adopting the meta-
   syntax conventions MUST define and register with IANA a unique, case
   insensitive <tag-type> element, to identify the specific mechanism
   that is being used for MailFrom validation.

   Private Tagging:   If MailFrom validity assessment is performed only
      within the scope of the domain referenced in the MailFrom address,
      then its semantic scope is private (closed), encompassing only
      that domain and the one that generated the validity information.
      To the rest of the Internet, the tag information is opaque, like a
      cookie.  In these situations, the closed system is free to use any
      tagging scheme it deems helpful, although a standard format aids
      other systems that wish to avoid re-tagging addresses that are

      already tagged, or to strip off the tag for compatibility with
      legacy systems that key on the MailFrom address of incoming mail.
      A simple scheme for this is defined in Section 4.

   Public Tagging:   Using a public-key approach, for signing the
      MailFrom's local-part permits intermediaries which process the
      envelope to validate that address.  For example, an intermediary
      that otherwise might create a bounce message would be able to
      decide that the MailFrom address use is not valid, so they might
      decide to terminate bounce processing.  Such a scheme might use
      the BATV meta-syntax in the following way:
   pub3=<crypted>=<loc-core>@example.com

      If the creator of a bounce could make this assessment, all of
      earlier intermedite MTAs also could.  Hence, every MTA would be
      able to assess whether a message has an unauthorized
      RFC2821.MailFrom.

      Unfortunately, none of the multiple existing public key services
      has yet gained wide adoption.  Therefore, this specification is
      not able to provide a single method for public MailFrom validity
      checking.

2.3.  Beyond BATV

   BATV defines a framework that retains the original local-part of the
   MailFrom address, within the BATV-encoded form.  This permits
   external inspection of the original local-part, such as for analyzing
   its use with respect to particular RFC2822.From addresses.
   Enhancements that go beyond the open information of BATV might
   replace the original local-part with some form of translation.
   Examples of such schemes could include:

   Alias:   The original RFC2821.MailFrom local-part could be replaced
      with an alternative local-part.  The meta-syntax provides a way of
      flagging the difference between the new local-part and the
      original.

   Opaque Pointer:   This could be used to consult a database with
      records of mail sent and bounces received.

   Challenge Response:   The receiver could make a DNS-query for
      instructions about processing the RFC2821.MailFrom bounce address.

Internet-Draft    Bounce Address Tag Validation (BATV)      January 2007


2.4.  Operation

   The basic methods for creating and interpreting BATV-encoded MailFrom
   addresses are very simple.

2.4.1.  Tag Creation

   The RFC2821.MailFrom address is specified by the RFC2822.Sender.
   This makes the MailFrom address an end-user string, created by the
   oMUA or MSA.  However it is entirely reasonable to have an outbound
   MTA, under administrative control of the Sender's domain, perform the
   necessary signing.  What is significant is that this requires a
   change to only two modules, one in the outbound sequence and one in
   the corresponding inbound sequence.  The change is transparent to all
   other systems components that transmit the message.

   NOTE:   If a MailFrom local-part already conforms to the meta-syntax
      then the string SHOULD be left unchanged, so as not to break
      forwarding.

   NOTE:   An MTA MUST ONLY tag addresses in domains whose inbound MTAs
      can validate the tags.  In particular, when an MTA is relaying a
      message, on behalf of another Administrative Management Domain
      (ADMD), it must not tag the MailFrom address, even if the original
      ADMD did not add a tag.  In all cases, the MTA must only tag
      addresses for which it has access to the signing key that
      corresponds to the validation key used by the inbound MTA for the
      address' domain.

2.4.2.  Tag Interpretation:

   Addresses that contain BATV tags can be interpreted for two different
   purposes: bounce address validation and bounce delivery.

   Address validation:   An MTA MAY validate a BATV-encoded MailFrom
      address.  This requires the MTA to be able to process the specific
      BATV validation scheme that is specified by the <tag-type> field.
      If the address is determined to be invalid, the MTA SHOULD process
      the address as having a permanent failure, for example by
      returning a 550 response to the SMTP command containing the
      address.

      The MTA MAY also require that the use of the address is
      appropriate, for example that the message is a bounce as indicated
      by a null RFC2821.MailFrom; other heuristically determined
      contexts MAY also be appropriate.  For example, messages with
      MailFroms beginning with "mailer-daemon@" are in practice almost
      always bounces.  Use of a BATV address in inappropriate contexts



Levine, et al.            Expires July 13, 2007                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft    Bounce Address Tag Validation (BATV)      January 2007


      SHOULD cause a permanent failure as above.

   Bounce delivery:   When an MTA within the specified address delivery
      domain's administration receives a delivery notification directed
      to a BATV-encoded address, the MTA SHOULD validate that address
      when that message has a null MailFrom.  A receiving server MAY
      also perform heuristic selection of other incoming mail, such as
      ones that have a MailFrom starting with "mailer-daemon@".  If it
      determines that the use is not valid, it SHOULD reject the message
      during the mail transfer connection, such as with SMTP.

      If the BATV address passes these checks the message SHOULD then be
      delivered to the original RFC2821.MailFrom address.  This original
      MailFrom address will be recovered as a side-effect of validating
      the BATV address.


3.  Local-Part Meta-Syntax

   A meta-syntax for the <local-part> of an address creates a public
   convention for partitioning an address' local-part field (left-hand
   side) into sub-fields of attributes associated with the <addr-spec>
   that was the original local-part.

   A standardized meta-syntax for local-part permits attributes to be
   present in the address, without requiring that public processing of
   the address have any understanding of the attributes' semantics.  The
   semantics of <local-part> are strictly local to the domain
   administering the <local-part> field.  This separation between global
   semantics, versus local, has been a powerful benefit to Internet
   mail.  It affords considerable operational flexibility.  The meta-
   syntax permits public information in an address to be richer, while
   maintaining the local/global separation.

   The generic element syntax for the structured fields defined for a
   BATV <local-part> is:

         local-part       = tag-type "=" tag-val "=" loc-core

         tag-type         = 1*( DIGIT / ALPHA / "-" )
                            ; specific, registered validation scheme

         loc-core         = {original local-part value}

         tag-val          = 1*( DIGIT / ALPHA / "-" )
                            ; the validation data

   This syntax is chosen so that software that needs, for legacy



Levine, et al.            Expires July 13, 2007                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft    Bounce Address Tag Validation (BATV)      January 2007


   compatibility reasons, to recover the original bounce address can do
   so by checking for the presence of the tag-type, and if it is
   present, discarding the local-part up through the second equal sign.


4.  Simple Private Signature (prvs)

   This scheme signs the original MailFrom by using a simple shared-key
   to add a hash of the address and some time-based randomizing
   information.

4.1.  Syntax

   This scheme is identified as:


         tag-type       = "prvs"
                           ; simple private signature

         tag-val        =  K DDD SSSSSS

         K              =  1DIGIT
                           ; key number, to allow key rotation

         DDD            =  3DIGIT
                           ; day number, low three digits of
                           ; the number of days since 1970
                           ; when the address will expire

         SSSSSS         =  6HEXDIG
                           ; hex of the first three bytes of the
                           ; SHA-1 HMAC of <hash-source> and a key

         hash-source    =  K DDD <orig-mailfrom>

         orig-mailfrom  =  {original RFC2821.MailFrom address}

4.2.  Operation

4.2.1.  Signature Creation

   PRVS creates a package around an existing <local-part>, comprising
   the PRVS label and the signature hash on the left.  The hash is
   extremely simple and not very robust, because the requirements for
   BATV do not entail strong protection.  The mechanism provides very
   weak protection against replay, in order to keep the effort to create
   or validate the signature small.

Internet-Draft    Bounce Address Tag Validation (BATV)      January 2007


4.2.2.  Signature Checking

   Checking of private signatures is only performed within the domain
   specified in the MailFrom header.  The first component that processes
   the MailFrom's local-part must be able to interpret the meta-syntax.
   It MAY also perform validation.

   The scheme described here permits algorithmic validation.  It does
   not require maintaining a database of information about recently sent
   messages.

   The DDD part of the <tag-val> allows a domain to limit the lifetime
   of PRVS addresses to give very basic protection against replay
   attacks.  If the expiry time has passed the address SHOULD be
   considered invalid even if the HMAC is OK.  The address lifetime
   SHOULD be 7 days, to allow for long delivery delays before a bounce
   occurs.  Since it is valid and often useful for a single message to
   provoke multiple bounces, it is specifically not a goal of BATV to
   prevent them.


5.  Interoperability

   BATV seeks to retrofit a standardized syntactic structure onto the
   <local-part> of an RFC2821.MailFrom email address.  Although it is
   based on an existing, standard structure, it will be used in new
   environments.  Because this field has previously been opaque to these
   environments, it is likely to create some usage problems with some
   existing services.  Problems are most likely in some services that
   operate in the scope of the delivery stage of processing, rather than
   in intermediaries between independent user services.  In particular
   serious problems are likely to be with third-party services that
   constrain local-part beyond the Internet standards.  Hence they
   restrict interoperability, even without concern for BATV.

   As an example, such systems incorrectly identify the sender of the
   message by using the MailFrom address, rather than the RFC2822.Sender
   address.  Examples are listed below.  Further, they require that this
   address be the same for all future postings from the RFC2822.From
   address.  Problems arise because messages authored by a particular
   RFC2822.From address are like to vary the associated MailFrom address
   over time, particularly when BATV encoding is used.

   Such systems SHOULD fix the underlying problem, at a minimum by using
   the RFC2822.Sender address to identify the sender.  However, note
   that a Internet mail does not require that the value of the Sender
   address be constant for a From address, and there are many,
   legitimate reasons that it varies.



Levine, et al.            Expires July 13, 2007                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft    Bounce Address Tag Validation (BATV)      January 2007


   Some systems MAY continue to require correlation between MailFrom and
   From.  For example the system might operate on the envelope before
   the message data has been transmitted, so software might strip off
   the meta-syntax to recover the <loc-core> which can then be used as
   the MailFrom address's original <local-part>.  For such validation
   processing this altered address MUST NOT be used for further mail-
   delivery processing.  Rather the MailFrom string MUST be preserved as
   it was received.

   The benefit of a standardized meta-syntax for adding validation
   attributes is that it permits such mechanisms to detect the
   "attribute" portions of the local-part and extract only the core
   portion, without having to understand any of the details of the
   attributes.

   The known and likely set of problem third-parties are:

   Greylisters:   A correct BATV implementation will only result in
      routine delays in this case.  However the result of BATV tagging
      MUST be a constant local-part, for a given message, and not (say)
      created at delivery time such that each retry gets a different
      validation string, which would prevent it from ever getting
      through to a greylisting site.

   Mailing Lists:   BATV will cause problems with some mailing lists
      that identify posters by their bounce address.  The list will not
      recognize the identical MailFrom addresses, because it will
      interpret the differing BATV attributes as part of the address.
      These services will either reject postings or pass them all to the
      moderator.

   Challenge-Response Systems:   The problem with these is similar to
      the that with mailing lists, but the challenged user will have to
      take special action for every message recipient that auto-sorts
      mail by bounce address.

   Sorting and Duplicate Detection:   Any system that sorts by bounce
      address (MailFrom) will interpret the addresses as different, even
      though they are not.  This may include whitelisting services.

   BATV requires that the sending and receiving mail software for a
   domain share the secret key used to create the signature.  Usually
   this is easy to arrange, by creating the signature in a domain's
   outgoing mail relay and checking it in the inbound MX if both are run
   by the same management.  But it is not necessary for a domain's
   inbound and outbound relays to be under the same management; for
   example it is fairly common for incoming mail for a small business
   domain to be received by an MTA run by a hosting company, while the

Internet-Draft    Bounce Address Tag Validation (BATV)      January 2007


   outbound mail is sent through the ISP that provides the connection to
   the company's office.  In this case, it may be necessary to sign the
   outgoing mail in the individual senders' MUAs, to check the signature
   in the individual recipients' MUAs, or both.


6.  Security Considerations

   This entire document pertains to the security of email's asynchronous
   error handling (bounce notification) mechanism, by describing a way
   to detect valid and invalid bounce addresses.  This document does not
   directly provide a mechanism for authenticating RFC2821.MailFrom
   addresses at intermediate.  The ability to perform validation across
   the entire transfer sequence is possible if a standardized public key
   scheme is defined.

   The PRVS scheme described here provides minimal protection of the
   RFC2821.Mailfrom against forgery, with detection done at the target
   (delivery) domain.  The scheme does not attempt to protect against a
   replay attack in which a valid, signed MailFrom is used but the
   message contents are replaced.  The same will be true for any other
   BATV scheme that does not include some link with the message data;
   however such protection is only reliable for the recipient of the
   original message, because the integrity of the link will often be
   broken when the original message data is mangled into the bounce.

   There are two common forms of email address forgery: guessing (e.g.
   attaching common <local-part>s to a domain) and harvesting (e.g. from
   the web or usenet).  Cryptographic BATV schemes make guessing attacks
   unfeasibly difficult; however these are relatively minor compared to
   replay attacks, which deserve closer attention.

   MailFrom addresses are not usually exposed in the places from which
   addresses are usually harvested.  Many mailing list systems archive
   messages sent to a list on the web; however they usually replace the
   original MailFrom address with one that refers to the mailing list
   manager.  So this case is generally not a problem, although there are
   exceptions.  There are other instances of systems that archive email
   publicly without altering the MailFrom address, such as bug tracking
   systems; these are a problem.

   A proportion of forgeries are caused by mass mailing viruses.  Unlike
   spammers, these have access to private email stores and are therefore
   more likely to be able to find and replay BATV addresses.  For that
   matter, they can generate MailFrom addresses that are entirely valid.

   The PRVS scheme includes a modest protection against replay attacks,
   by virtue of its using an expiry time, which prevents very old
