             Deprecation of AS_SET and AS_CONFED_SET in BGP
             draft-ietf-idr-deprecate-as-set-confed-set-02

Abstract

   BCP 172 (i.e., RFC 6472) recommends not using AS_SET and
   AS_CONFED_SET in the Border Gateway Protocol.  This document advances
   this recommendation to a standards requirement in BGP; it proscribes
   the use of the AS_SET and AS_CONFED_SET types of path segments in the
   AS_PATH.  This is done to simplify the design and implementation of
   BGP and to make the semantics of the originator of a route clearer.
   This will also simplify the design, implementation, and deployment of
   various BGP security mechanisms.  This document (if approved) updates
   RFC 4271 and RFC 5065 by eliminating AS_SET and AS_CONFED_SET types,
   and obsoletes RFC 6472.

1.  Introduction

   BCP 172 [RFC6472] makes a recommendation for not using AS_SET (see
   [RFC4271]) and AS_CONFED_SET (see [RFC5065]) in the Border Gateway
   Protocol (BGP).  This document advances the BCP recommendation to a
   standards requirement in BGP; it proscribes the use of the AS_SET and
   AS_CONFED_SET types of path segments in the AS_PATH.

   The AS_SET path segment in the AS_PATH attribute (Sections 4.3 and
   5.1.2 of [RFC4271]) is created by a router that is performing route
   aggregation and contains an unordered set of Autonomous Systems
   (ASes) that the update has traversed.  The AS_CONFED_SET path segment
   (see [RFC5065]) in the AS_PATH attribute is created by a router that
   is performing route aggregation and contains an unordered set of
   Member AS Numbers in the local confederation that the update has
   traversed.  It is very similar to AS_SETs but is used within a
   confederation.

   By performing aggregation, a router is combining multiple existing
   routes into a single new route.  The aggregation together with the
   use of AS_SET blurs the semantics of origin AS for the prefix being
   announced.  Therefore, the aggregation with AS_SET (or AS_CONFED_SET)
   can cause operational issues, such as not being able to authenticate
   a route origin for the aggregate prefix in new BGP security
   technologies such as those that take advantage of X.509 extensions
   for IP addresses and AS identifiers [RFC3779] [RFC6480] [RFC6811]

   [RFC8205].  This in turn could result in reachability problems for
   the aggregated prefix and its components (i.e., more-specific
   prefixes).  The aggregation as described above could also create
   traffic engineering issues, because the precise path information for
   the component prefixes are not preserved.

   From analysis of past Internet routing data, it is apparent that
   aggregation that involves AS_SETs is very seldom used in practice on
   the public Internet [Analysis] and when it is used, it is often used
   incorrectly -- only a single AS in the AS_SET are by far the most
   common cases.  Also, very often the same AS appears in the
   AS_SEQUENCE and the AS_SET in the BGP update.  The occurrence of
   reserved AS numbers ([IANA-SP-ASN]) is also somewhat frequent.
   Because the aggregation involving AS_SETs is very rarely used, the
   reduction in table size provided by this is extremely small, and any
   advantage thereof is outweighed by additional complexity in BGP.  As
   noted above, AS_SETs also pose impediments to implementation of new
   BGP security technologies.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Recommendations

   BGP speakers conforming to this document (i.e., conformant BGP
   speakers) MUST NOT locally generate BGP UPDATE messages containing
   AS_SET or AS_CONFED_SET.  Conformant BGP speakers SHOULD NOT send BGP
   UPDATE messages containing AS_SET or AS_CONFED_SET.  Upon receipt of
   such messages, conformant BGP speakers SHOULD use the "Treat-as-
   withdraw" error handling behavior as per [RFC7606].

   If a network operator wishes to consider BGP UPDATE messages with
   AS_SET or AS_CONFED_SET (received from an external peer) for path
   selection, they MAY have a feature (knob) in their BGP speaker to opt
   to do so on a per peer basis.  The operator should understand the
   full implications of choosing this option.  There is no knob
   concerning locally generated BGP UPDATE messages, i.e., as stated
   before a conformant BGP speaker must not locally generate BGP UPDATE
   messages with AS_SET or AS_CONFED_SET.

   Network operators MUST NOT locally generate any new announcements
   containing AS_SET or AS_CONFED_SET.  If they have announced routes
   with AS_SET or AS_CONFED_SET in them, then they SHOULD withdraw those

   routes and re-announce routes for the aggregate or component prefixes
   (i.e., the more-specific routes subsumed by the previously aggregated
   route) without AS_SET or AS_CONFED_SET in the updates.

   It is worth noting that new BGP security technologies (such as those
   that take advantage of X.509 extensions for IP addresses and AS
   identifiers [RFC3779] [RFC6480] [RFC6811] [RFC8205]) might not
   support routes with AS_SET or AS_CONFED_SET in them, and may treat
   routes containing them as infeasible even before the updated BGP in
   this document is implemented.

4.  Updates to Existing RFCs

   This document deprecates the AS_SET (type 1) AS_PATH segment type
   from [RFC4271].  BGP speakers conforming to this document (i.e.,
   conformant BGP speakers) MUST NOT locally generate BGP UPDATE
   messages containing AS_SET.  Conformant BGP speakers SHOULD NOT send
   BGP UPDATE messages containing AS_SET.  Upon receipt of such
   messages, conformant BGP speakers SHOULD use the "Treat-as-withdraw"
   error handling behavior as per [RFC7606].

   This document deprecates the AS_CONFED_SET (type 4) AS_PATH segment
   type from [RFC5065].  Conformant BGP speakers MUST NOT locally
   generate BGP UPDATE messages containing AS_CONFED_SET.  Conformant
   BGP speakers SHOULD NOT send BGP UPDATE messages containing
   AS_CONFED_SET.  Upon receipt of such messages, conformant BGP
   speakers SHOULD use the "Treat-as-withdraw" error handling behavior
   as per [RFC7606].

   Wherever mentions of AS_SET or AS_CONFED_SET occur in [RFC4271] and
   [RFC5065], appropriate modification or elimination of the text must
   be made in future RFCs that would replace these RFCs, consistent with
   the deprecation of AS_SET and AS_CONFED_SET.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document obsoletes the use of aggregation techniques that create
   AS_SETs or AS_CONFED_SETs.  Obsoleting these path segment types from
   BGP and removal of the related code from implementations would
   potentially decrease the attack surface for BGP.  Deployments of new
   BGP security technologies [RFC6480] [RFC6811] [RFC8205] benefit
   greatly if AS_SET and AS_CONFED_SET are not used in BGP.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires no IANA actions.
