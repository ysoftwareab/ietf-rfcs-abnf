2.  Introduction

   Pre-configured routing is a very useful approach to achieve service
   resteration.  Generally, except primary route, operator also sets a
   group of routes (usually with priority), i.e. pre-configured route
   set,for a service.  When the primary route fails, router can select a
   proper resteration route from pre-configured route set.  By this way,
   faster resteration can be achieved.

   Since pre-configured routes are pre-configured by management plane,
   it can't be updated when network state changes dynamically.  In some
   cases, e.g. a fiber on the pre-configured route is cut, if operator
   can't update pre-configured routes in time, the pre-configured routes
   will become unavailable.  Otherwise, generally the pre-configured
   routes will be verified whether it is available before it is used to
   signal a connection.  This is also due to the problem that pre-
   configured routes can't be updated timely.  So this will introduce
   another problem that time delay will affect service recovery.

   This document introduces a PCE-based pre-configured routing method,
   which uses PCE to update pre-configured route at the policy of
   network management.  This method helps to optimize network resources
   and avoid the unavailablity of pre-configured routes.


3.  Application of pre-configured Routing

   As illustrated in figure 1, an example network is comprised of 9
   nodes and an external PCE.  Suppose there is a service between A and
   I. In order to create the connection, source node A request a working
   path.  And PCE responds node A with path A-D-I.  However, to provide
   fast recovery when primary path A-D-I fails, node A can also request
   additional pre-configured routes.  And PCE reponds with path A-B-C-I
   and A-E-F-G-H-I providing node A requested 2 pre-configured routes.

   To provide the availability of pre-configured routes, PCE can
   dynamically upade these routes according to the local policy.  For
   example, PCE can be configured to update Pre-configured route when
   network status changes, or a 30 seconds timer expires etc.

   In figure 1, Assume PCE is configured to update pre-configured route

   as network status changes, when link BC failed, PCE will
   aucomatically compute and send route A-B-D-I to source node A to
   refresh previously requested pre-configured route.

   If primary path fails, e.g. the fiber on link AD is cut, node A can
   use pre-configured route A-B-C-I to recovery service between A and I
   without requesting PCE again.

4.  Architecture Analysis and Requirement

4.1.  Architecture Analysis

   [RFC4655] introduced 5 PCE models which can be categorized according
   to whether PCE functionality is integrated into the network element.
   Under this methodology, two groups of PCE model, i.e. composite PCE
   and external PCE, is generated.

   For composite PCE, due to the resource limitation of the card, the
   power of CPU is relatively weak, so the PCE capability is also
   limited.  However, compared to composite PCE, external PCE has more
   resources (i.e. memory and CPU power etc), and it even can be
   presented as a dedicated server.  Therefore, external PCE is more
   powerful than composite PCE.  The application of pre-configured
   routing will increase compuataion burden to PCE.  Due to its powerful
   computation capability, external PCE is more adequate than composite
   PCE.  However, if there is not much application of pre-configured

Internet-Draft     PCE App for Pre-configured Routing       October 2009


   routing, composite PCE can also operate well.

   [RFC4655] also describes stateful PCE and stateless PCE.  For
   statefull PCE, there is a strict synchronization between the PCE and
   not only the network states (in term of topology and resource
   information), but also the set of computed paths and reserved
   resources in use in the network.  So, it is easier to applying pre-
   configured routing on stateful PCE.

   Furthermore, considering the PCE failure, if an implementation has a
   backup PCE, then the primary and backup PCE MUST keep strict
   synchronization.  And switching to the backup PCE can't affect the
   correctness of path computation

   However, the selection of PCE model, stateful PCE or stateless PCE is
   out of this document.  And the synchronizt between primary and backup
   PCE is also out of this document, the operator can make a selection
   according to network deployment.

4.2.  Requirements to PCE

   In order to support pre-configured routing, PCE SHOULD record pre-
   configured route information, and maintain its status.  When network
   status changes, PCE SHOULD compute the affected pre-configured
   routes.  However, PCE MAY also compute pre-configured routes in idle
   state to obtain the optimized pathes.  The policy for PCE compute
   pre-configured routes SHOULD be able to configured.

4.3.  Requirements to PCEP

   [RFC4657] gives detailed generic requirements for PCE communication
   protocol.  However, in orderto support pre-configured routing,
   specific extensions to PCEP is required.  For PCReq, it SHOULD be
   possible for PCC to request pre-configured route.  When PCE receives
   a request identified with pre-configured routing, it SHOULD perform
   path computation accroding to the required policy, e.g. node
   disjoint, link disjoint and SRLG disjoint etc.  And in the response
   message, PCE SHOULD able to specify which one is pre-exsiting route.
   If mulitple pre-configured routes are requested, PCE SHOULD give each
   pre-configured route a priority in PCRep message.  If PCE doesn't
   support pre-configured routing it SHOULD give a negative response,
   and the reason for computation failure.

   When network status changes, PCE SHOULD re-compute pre-configured
   routes according the configured policy.  If new better pre-configured
   route is computed, PCE should send it to PCC.  There are two options
   for PCE to send pre-configured route as follows:

Internet-Draft     PCE App for Pre-configured Routing       October 2009


   PCRep is used to respond route computation result naturally.  If it
   is used to send pre-configured route, a new flag SHOULD be defined to
   indicate the route carried is pre-configured route.


5.  Extensions to PCEP and Procedures

5.1.  New Flag Of The LSPA Object

   The LSPA (LSP Attributes defined in [RFC5440]) object specifies
   various TE LSP attributes to be taken into account by the PCE during
   path computation.  The LSPA object can be carried within a PCReq
   message, or a PCRep message.

   In order to support pre-configured route in PCReq and PCRep message,
   a new flag, Pre-Configured Route flag, is defined in LSPA (LSP
   Attributes) object.  The definition of Pre-Configured Route flag is:


       Bit Number    Name Flag
       22            Pre-Configured Route


   When PCC requests pre-configured route, it SHOULD set Pre-Configured
   Route flag in LSPA object.  And PCE SHOULD also set this flag, when
   it sends computed pre-configured route to PCC.  If PCE can't
   recognize Pre-Configured Route flag, a PCErr message SHOULD be sent
   with an Error-Type=2 (Capability not supported).


6.  Security Considerations

   This document has no requirement for a change to the security models
   within PCEP and associated protocols.


7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  New Flag Of The LSPA Object

   A new flag of the LSPA object (specified in [RFC5440]) is defined in
   this document.

        Pre-Configured Route Flag
        Bit Number      Name Flag                Reference
