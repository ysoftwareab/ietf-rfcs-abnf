                 Use Cases for an Interface to MPLS TE
                  draft-huang-i2rs-mpls-te-usecases-02

Abstract

   Network services based on Virtual Networks (VN) or Virtual Circuits
   (VC) may be run over MPLS-TE links, and support network
   configurations such as hub-spoke, service routing, or on-demand
   networks.  An MPLS Traffic Engineering(TE) network is typically
   configured and the results of its operation analyzed through network
   management interfaces (CLI, SNMP or NETCONF).  These interactions
   control each of the MPLS TE links, and diagnose operations issues
   concerning link configuration, MPLS TE protection, and traffic
   switching-over.  The network management functions also monitor MPLS
   TE links and provide fault detection.

   The Interface to the Routing System (I2RS) (draft-ietf-i2rs-
   architecture) programmatic interface to the routing system provides
   an alternative way to control the configuration and diagnose the
   operation of MPLS links.  I2RS may be used for the configuration,
   manipulation, polling, or analyzing MPLS TE.  This document describes
   a set of use cases for which I2RS can be used for MPLS TE.  It is
   intended to provide a base for a solution draft describing I2RS
   information models and protocol functions that will support virtual
   networks that utilize MPLS TE.

1.  Introduction

   Network services based on Virtual Networks (VN) or Virtual Circuits
   (VC) may be run over MPLS-TE links, and support network
   configurations such as hub-spoke, service routing, or on-demand
   networks.  Typically, MPLS TE networks are configured and results of
   its operation analyzed through network management interfaces (CLI,
   SNMP or NETCONF).  These interactions to control MPLS TE links and

   diagnose their operation encompass: MPLS TE configuration, MPLS TE
   protection, traffic switching-over, traffic detection, and fault
   detection.

   The I2RS architecture and protocol as defined in
   [[I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture]] may be used to control network
   protocols like MPLS TE using a set of programmatic interfaces.  These
   programmatic interfaces allow one I2RS client to control the MPLS TE
   network by analyzing its operational state and TE LSP data, plus
   manipulating TE LSP's configuration to achieve various goals.  I2RS
   is not intented to replace any replace any existing network
   management or configuration mechanisms, (E.g.  Command Line Interface
   or NETCONF).  Instead, I2RS is intended to augment these existing
   mechanisms by defining a standardized set of programmatic interfaces
   to enable easier configuration, interrogation, and analysis of the
   protocol.

   This document describes set of use cases for which I2RS's
   programmatic interfaces can be used to control and analyze the
   operation of MPLS TE.  The use cases described in this document cover
   the following aspects of MPLS TE: MPLS TE configuration, MPLS TE
   protection, MPLS TE traffic switch-over, monitoring of MPLS TE and
   fault detection.  The goal is to increase the community's
   understanding of where the I2RS MPLS TE extensions fit within the
   overall I2RS architecture.  It is intended to provide a basis for the
   solutions draft describing the set of Interfaces to the MPLS TE.

2.  I2RS Requirements from the MPLS TE Use cases

   This section summarize the requirements from the MPLS TE use cases.
   Each of these requirements has been given an an ID number of MPLS-TE-
   REQ-nn for ease of reference.  While this summary provides a handy
   reference, the reader is advised to review the full details of the
   MPLS TE scenario.

   The requirements from the Traffic Steering use case are:

   o  MPLS-TE-REQ-01: Network programming software managing the static
      CR-LSP devices may incorporate an I2RS Client along with a path
      calculation entity, a label management entity, and a bandwidth
      management entity.  The I2RS Client should be abl to communicate
      the static configuration to the network nodes, and monitor the
      status of the CR-LSPs.

   o  MPLS-TE-REQ-02: The I2Client should be able to synchronously send
      the configuration for all of the network nodes from egress node to
      ingress node via the I2RS Agents attached to each node, and be
      able to delay the final ingress node configuration until all the

      I2RS AGents on all other nodes toward the egress have denoted a
      successful path set-up.

   o  [MPLS-TE-REQ-03:] MPLS TE defines abundant constraints such as
      explicit path, bandwidth, affinity, SRLG, priority, hop limit, and
      others.  The I2RS Client Agent exchange should be able to signal
      concurrent local path calculation could obtain an optimized result
      and allow more services to be held in a TE network.  The I2RS
      Agent should be able to trigger a global concurrent re-
      optimization at a specific time on multiple nodes by communicating
      with each node's I2RS agent.

   o  [MPLS-TE-REQ-04:] The I2RS client should be able to manually
      calculate a re-optimization of the the MPLS TE network and send
      the new constraints including the calculated path to each node via
      the I2RS agent with an indication to re-signal the TE LSPs with
      make-before-break method.

   o  [MPLS-TE-REQ-05] With I2RS, the node's I2RS agent should be able
      to send to an I2RS client a status notification that not enough
      resources exist for a back up LSP and TE tunnel.  Upon receiving
      this notification the I2RS client should be able to trigger
      concurrent calculation for the failed path calculation of the
      backup LSP or TE tunnel and send the updated paths to I2RS agents
      with a command to re-signal the TE LSPS with make-before-break
      Method.

   o  [MPLS-TE-REQ-06] With I2RS, upon receipt the failure notification
      from an I2RS Agent, the I2RS client would create a global
      concurrent optimization to handle the failure event.  This would
      occur by the I2RS client signalling the I2RS agents on all nodes
      to: a) trigger a new concurrent calculation of the backup LSP or
      TE tunnel via failed path calculation, and b) re-signal updates to
      the TE LSPs process with a make-before-break method.

   o  [MPLS-TE-REQ-07] Upon receiving a signal an upgrade event signal
      (from operator), the I2RS client could calculate another path for
      the affected TE tunnels to deviate traffic away from the resource
      being upgraded, and then send the request to I2RS agents on the
      appropriate nodes to move the traffic.  After the upgrade
      completes, the I2RS client can simply remove I2RS configurations
      causing the traffic to revert to the original path.  Or, the I2RS
      can re-optimize the TE tunnels for another pathways (E.g.  as a
      part of a sequence of upgrades).

   o  [MPLS-TE-REQ-08] I2RS agents can notify I2RS Clients of impending
      or existing MPLS TE overload conditions that might cause TE LSP




Huang, et al.            Expires January 5, 2015                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                I2RS MPLS LDP                    July 2014


      rejections.  This overload conditions include: due to CPU, memory,
      LSP label space, or LSP numbers.

   o  [MPLS-TE-09] Automatic bandwidth adjustment applications can also
      be linked to the I2RS clients need to monitor the traffic on TE
      tunnels in order to provide traffic analysis.  The I2RS client
      should be able to read the TE Tunnel topology and the bandwidth
      analysis in order to automatically calculate a new path for the TE
      tunnel if it is needed.  The I2RS Client also needs to be able to
      the I2RS agents in the nodes to install the new TE Tunnels with
      the make-before-break option.

   o  [MPLS-TE-REQ-10]  With I2RS, the node failure or link failure can
      be part of the notification stream sent by an I2RS Agent to an
      I2RS Client on a centralized server gathering information.

   o  [MPLS-TE-REQ-11] The I2RS client can notify the I2RS agents on
      specific nodes (or devices) to re-signal TE LSPs one by one if
      there is a resource dependency.  [MPLS-TE-REQ-12] The I2RS Client
      can gather the TE LSPs' state from I2RS Agents on all nodes in
      order to coordinate such handling of LSP resources.

   o  [MPLS-TE-REQ-13] The I2RS Clients collecting information from I2RS
      Agents can be arranged in a hierarchy to provide scaling of
      collections.  An application hosting an I2RS client collecting
      information from I2RS Agents on nodes can have an I2RS Agent that
      reports combined information to a single location.

3.  MPLS TE Configuration

   There are two types of TE LSP: static CR-LSP and dynamic TE LSP
   created by protocol of RSVP-TE or CR-LDP.  Static CR-LSP is
   configured with forwarding items such as interface, label and
   bandwidth, etc. node by node.  Dynamic TE LSP is configured with MPLS
   TE parameters which are used to calculate path and set up TE LSP by
   protocol.  Both configurations are complex.

   The following cases will introduce how to improve configuration
   efficiency with I2RS and I2RS client.

3.1.  Static CR-LSP Configuration

   Currently, nodes and interfaces to be configured with a Static CR-LSP
   are assigned label and bandwidth values before the static CR-LSP is
   configured through some network management configuration interface
   (e.g.  CLI or NETCONF).  Due to this complex configuration, Static
   CR-LSP is only used in small, simple topologies with few services.

Internet-Draft                I2RS MPLS LDP                    July 2014


   [MPLS-TE-REQ-01] Network programming software managing the static CR-
   LSP devices may incorporate an I2RS Client along with a path
   calculation entity, a label management entity, and a bandwidth
   management entity.  The I2RS Client will communicate the static
   configuration to the network nodes, and monitor the status of the CR-
   LSPs.

   Currently the downloading of CR-LSP forwarding is processed node by
   node.  When an ingress node finishes download before all other nodes
   have completed, the forwarding path will not be set-up and the
   traffic will be lost.

   [MPLS-TE-REQ-02] With I2RS, the I2RS client may send the
   configuration for all of the network nodes from egress node to
   ingress node.  The final ingress node configuration may delayed until
   all other nodes toward the egress have denoted a successful path set-
   up.

3.2.  RSVP-TE Policy Configuration

   MPLS TE defines abundant constraints such as explicit path,
   bandwidth, affinity, SRLG, priority, hop limit, and others.  A local
   path calculation entity would calculate an appropriate path according
   to the constraints.  It is common knowledge that the calculated
   results are closely related with the request order, different
   calculation order may have different results.  Concurrent calculation
   could obtain an optimized result and allow more services to be held
   in a TE network.

   [MPLS-TE-REQ-03:] With I2RS, an I2RS client could trigger global
   concurrent re-optimization at a specific time on multiple nodes by
   communicating with each node's I2RS agent.

   [MPLS-TE-REQ-04:] Alternatively, the I2RS client could manually re-
   optimize the MPLS TE network and send the new constraints including
   the calculated path to each node via the I2RS agent with an
   indication to re-signal the TE LSPs with make-before-break method.

4.  MPLS TE Protection

   There are many kinds of protection for MPLS TE, such as TE tunnel
   protection, TE LSP protection and TE FRR protection.  Further, each
   protection may have two methods: 1:1 and 1+1 protection.  FRR may
   have another two methods: link and node protection.  With I2RS, I2RS
   client can define the protection mode according to the service
   requirement and transmit to the I2RS agent on each node.





Huang, et al.            Expires January 5, 2015                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                I2RS MPLS LDP                    July 2014


   In addition, typically when one node's calculations determine that
   there is not enough resource for the backup LSP or TE tunnel, it is
   usually not true in the distributed network.  If the existing LSP or
   TE tunnel could be adjusted to bypass some links or nodes, the
   necessary resources will be released to provide the backup LSP or TE
   tunnel.

   [MPLS-TE-REQ-05] With I2RS, the node's I2RS agent can send to an I2RS
   client the status notification of not enough resources for back up
   LSP and TE tunnel.  Upon receiving this notification the I2RS client
   could trigger concurrent calculation for the failed path calculation
   of the backup LSP or TE tunnel and send the updated paths to I2RS
   agents with a command to re-signal the TE LSPS with make-before-break
   Method.

5.  MPLS TE Traffic Switch Overs

   This section describes use cases for the MPLS TE traffic switch over
   caused by failure detection, network upgrading, overloading, and
   schedule traffic movements.

5.1.  Failure Detection

   There are many failure detection technologies such as Ethernet OAM/
   BFD/ OAM/RSVP Hello.  When a failure is detected, traffic will be
   switched over to the backup path.  Re-optimization of the TE tunnel
   may fail for insufficient resource.

   [MPLS-TE-REQ-06] With I2RS, upon receipt the failure notification
   from an I2RS Agent, the I2RS client would create a global concurrent
   optimization to handle the failure event.  This would occur by the
   I2RS client signaling the I2RS agents on all nodes to: a) trigger a
   new concurrent calculation of the backup LSP or TE tunnel via failed
   path calculation, and b) re-signal updates to the TE LSPs process
   with a make-before-break method.

5.2.  Network Upgrading

   When upgrades in a network are planned (e.g., for maintenance
   purposes), some graceful mechanisms can be used to avoid traffic
   disruption by gracefully shutting down MPLS-TE or GMPLS-TE resources.
   The resources include TE links, component links within bundled TE
   links, label resources, and an entire TE node.  Typically IGP or
   RSVP-TE protocol is extended to notify ingress node to bypass the
   shut down point.

   [MPLS-TE-REQ-07] With I2RS, the operator signals the upgrade event to
   the application associated with the I2RS client.  The I2RS client



Huang, et al.            Expires January 5, 2015                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                I2RS MPLS LDP                    July 2014


   could calculate another path for the affected TE tunnels to deviate
   traffic away from the resource being upgraded.  The I2RS client would
   then communicate with I2RS agents on the appropriate nodes to move
   the traffic.  After the upgrade completes, the I2RS client can simply
   remove I2RS configurations causing the traffic to revert to the
   original path.  Or, the I2RS can re-optimize the TE tunnels for
   another pathways (E.g.  as a part of a sequence of upgrades).

5.3.  Handling Node Overload

   When a node with MPLS TE support becomes overloaded due to the usage
   exceeding maximums of CPU, memory, LSP label space, or LSP number
   space, the setup of new TE LSPs should be rejected.  The overload
   condition may also impact existing LSPs, and even cause flapping of
   MPLS TEs.  Typically, a threshold value is set to avoid the overload
   condition so that existing TE LSPs will not be impacted.  Normally,
   IGP protocols or RSVP-TE would be extended to notify all other nodes
   of the overload condition.  This notification allows ingress nodes to
   bypass the overloaded node.

   [MPLS-TE-REQ-08] I2RS agents can notify I2RS Clients of impending or
   existing MPLS TE overload conditions that might cause TE LSP
   rejections.  This overload conditions include: due to CPU, memory,
   LSP label space, or LSP numbers.

6.  Monitoring of MPLS TE

6.1.  Performance Monitoring

   Typically, performance measurement such as traffic statistics is done
   in the ingress node of TE tunnel.  Applications such as traffic
   analysis or traffic forecasts depend on these traffic statistics
   being reported to centralize site for processing

   With I2RS, the I2RS client can be attached to the application as
   gather the traffic statistics from I2RS agents running on the ingress
   nodes.

   [MPLS-TE-REQ09] Automatic bandwidth adjustment applications can also
   be linked to the I2RS clients that monitor the traffic on TE tunnels
   and provide analysis.  The I2RS client can read the TE Tunnel
   topology and the bandwidth analysis in order to automatically
   calculate a new path for the TE tunnel if it is needed.  The I2RS
   Client would then signal the I2RS agents in the nodes to install the
   new TE Tunnels with the make-before-break option.

Internet-Draft                I2RS MPLS LDP                    July 2014


6.2.  Fault Monitoring

   When node or link failure happens, traffic will be switched over to
   the backup path.  At the same time, the failure information will be
   reported and recorded.  Network operators will process network
   management and maintenance based on the failed information.

   [MPLS-TE-REQ-10]  With I2RS, the node failure or link failure can be
   part of the notification stream sent by an I2RS Agent to an I2RS
   Client on a centralized server gathering information.

6.3.  LSP Monitoring

   In the global concurrent re-optimization process in section 2.2, an
   LSP update may depend on another LSP to release resources for it.

   [MPLS-TE-REQ-11] The I2RS client can notify the I2RS agents on
   specific nodes (or devices) to re-signal TE LSPs one by one if there
   is a resource dependency.  [MPLS-TE-REQ-12] The I2RS Client can
   gather the TE LSPs' state from I2RS Agents on all nodes in order to
   coordinate such handling of LSP resources.

   [MPLS-TE-REQ-13] The I2RS Clients collecting information from I2RS
   Agents can be arranged in a hierarchy to provide scaling of
   collections.  An application hosting an I2RS client collecting
   information from I2RS Agents on nodes can have an I2RS Agent that
   reports combined information to a centralized service as shown in the
   figure 1 below

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document includes no request to IANA.

8.  Security Considerations

   The MPLS TE use cases described in this document assumes use of
   I2RS's programmatic interfaces described in the I2RS framework
   mentioned in [I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture], and as a use case does not
   change the underlying security issues.
