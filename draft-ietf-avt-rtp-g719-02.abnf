L=0 (NO_DATA) is used to indicate an empty frame, this is useful
int-delay = "int-delay:" source-delay *("," source-delay)

source-delay = SSRC ":" delay-value

SSRC = 1*8HEXDIG ; The 32-bit SSRC encoded in hex format

delay-value = 1*5DIGIT ; The delay value in RTP timestamp ticks

b= parameter MUST be used to allow the extra bit rate needed to
