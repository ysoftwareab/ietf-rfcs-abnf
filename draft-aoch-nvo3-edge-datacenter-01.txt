                 draft-aoch-nvo3-edge-datacenter-01.txt

Abstract

   This document introduces the Edge Datacentet network, and describe
   some use cases about Edge Datacenter, discusses an important
   component in the Edge Datacenter:Service Gateway and its functions,
   elaborates the requirements on Service Gateway.

   Service Gateway works as a Flow Split Device(FSD) in the Edge DC
   network, it needs to not only play a gateway of the edge Datacenter
   network, implementing coordination with existing technology, but also
   meets many new requirements.  For example, to make sure the packets
   goes into Edge DC or Metro network, SDN forwarding, and as a leaf in
   the leaf-spin architecture.

1.  Introduction

   With the challenge and the chances of the new network SDN/NFV and the
   development of the Datacenter, the provider is facing many changes
   from traditional network, which is representive by traditional CO.
   How to use the resource of the traditinal CO fully and achieve the
   transition to the SDN/NFV is the problem providers and vendors need
   to consider.  CO re-architection is the attractive to more and more
   providers and vendors.  and getting more and more attention.  Using
   lots of CO resource, the providers can re-architected CO to Edge DC,
   which is more adaptive in SDN/NFV.

   In this document, we will present some use cases of the Edge
   Datacenter and its main component, Service gateway.  As a result,
   some requirements are proposed for Edge DC and Service Gateway.

Internet-Draft   The use case in Edge Datacenter network       July 2017


2.  Terminology

   Edge DC(EDC): a Datacenter network which is close to user, may by
   recontructureed from CO, and is SDN/NFV

   Servie Gateway: flow split device(FSD) in the Edge Datacenter
   network.

   FSD(Flow Split Device): device to split user flow according to the
   control flow table, include forwarding plane and stack module.

   CO: Center Office.

3.  Problem statement

   Current network is facing some bottlenecks which also rises some
   important requirements.

   1.Low latency:Generally, there is more than 10ms latency between user
   and application in the cloud.  If we put some application requiring
   low latency to network front end, low latency can be meet by this
   closing to user mode.

   2.Massive access: One of the bottlneck of the network is from the
   increasing number of session to access to the network, and it's
   difficult to meet the explosive session in current network.  It is
   required to adpot NFV, and to seperate the control plane and user
   plane.  Meanwhile, Massive IP address can be processsed at the edge
   of the network in the case of IoT, so that IP address management can
   also be optimized.

   3.Large traffic: There will be a serious pressure in bandwidth
   resource if the large traffic is transitted from the edge of the
   network to the core of the network.  EDC can be used for these large
   traffic locally process so that some of them can be absorbed at the
   edge of the network.

4.  Edge Datacenter

   From above section, we know that EDC(Edge Datacenter) can meet the
   challenge from the low latency, Large traffic and massive sessions by
   improving the capability at the edge of network and providing a cloud
   architecture.  The interoworking archtecture about EDC is as
   Figure 1.

                                                 Figure 1


   Considering there are many communication COs which have lots of
   traditional dedicated devices in providers network, with the
   evoluation of SDN/NFV, Edge Datacenter can be developed based on the
   CO.  An example of Edge Datacenter is showed as Figure 1.  In the
   Edge Datacenter, general server can be used as network element.
   Virtual network elements includes vBNG,vCPE,vOLT, etc.  And in
   generally, the Edge Datacenter uses leaf-spin topology.  There are
   three types of leaf: Distribution leaf, Server leaf and Board leaf.
   Server leaf is connecting Server.  Board leaf is the DGW providing DC
   interconnection.  Distribution leaf is the SGW in Figure 2.  As a key
   node in the Edge datacenter, Service Gateway will be elaborated in
   the next section.

4.1.  Use cases of the EDC

   EDC is in the place that is closest to user.  It may not have a large
   scale, but because of its "edge" propoerty, it can meet most access
   requirements from user.These EDCs can get realtime data update
   through WAN and core DC.  By the EDC, we can not only avoid to
   tranmit lots of duplicated data, but also let the users get the same
   service and data as same as from core DC, but with better experience.

   In this section, we will list 4 use cases of the EDC to make it
   clear.

4.1.1.  Future video application

   In this use case, all the video traffic are getted from EDC so that
   the users can get better experience when they play games or watch
   video,etc.  EDC has the capability of abstract for elephant
   traffic(IPTV), and support the extremely low latency video
   application.  Figure 3 is the diagram of this case.

4.1.2.  Edge IOT control application

   EDC has its own computational capbility, and getting more and more
   intelligent.  In the case that UAV( UnmannedAerialVehicle ), it needs
   to communicate with the apps in EDC so that the UAV can be remote
   controlled.  Similar with other IOT control scenarios.  Figure 4 is
   the diagram of this case.

4.1.3.  Home Hybird Cloud

   In this case, EDC is an extension of Home Gateway.  Some expanded
   computation or expanded store are extended into EDC instead of on
   HGW.  Even some APPs can also extened into EDC.  Users can get more
   applications, such as OTT white box, remote download, and remote
   desktop, etc.  Figure 5 is the diagram of this case.

4.1.4.  Light weight lease line based on application

   In this use case, EDC is a control node for user 2/3 layer lease line
   (VxLAN or MPLS).  It can support dynamically setup the tunnel
   according to application identification; support user private IP
   address or address management, etc.  Figure 6 is the diagram of this
   case.

5.  Service Gateway

   From those use case above, we know that Service Gateway as a key node
   in the forwarding plane, is a flow distribution device in Edge DC
   network.  It needs not only to support currently existing protocols,
   but aslo to meet all kinds of new requirements, ie.  SDN forwarding,
   virtualization,SDN control, and spine-leaf network architecture,
   dynamic SFC, etc.  The main purpose of the Service Gateway is to
   improve the forwarding, and converge or distribute traffic according
   to different service.  By the Service Gateway, we can avoid the
   hairpin of the traffic to Metro network, and divide the traffic into
   north-south traffic and south-east traffic clearly.

5.1.  Functions

5.1.1.  PPPoE proxy

   To terminate PPPoE tunnel.

5.1.2.  VxLAN encapsulation

   Encapsulate the packets into Edge DC with VxLAN as VTEP.  Provide
   VxLAN mapping, forwarding, and interconnection with VLAN as a
   gateway.

5.1.3.  C/S VLAN forwarding

   Support QinQ VLAN forwarding, so that be compatible to traditional
   network, and reduce the capacity of FDB.

5.1.4.  Distribution

   Achieve traffic distribution according to service VLAN.  The
   forwarding table on the SGW can be configurated by the SDN controller
   with NATCONF or OFPCONFIG protocol.

   Can implement linea forwarding based any field in IP header.

6.  Conclusion

   CO being re-architected as Edge DC is a very critical step for
   provider's evolving to SDN/NFV.

7.  Security Considerations

   Service Gateway must have the capability of checking the validation
   of user's address.

8.  IANA Considerations
