1. Introduction 
                        
  This document describes the extended functions and their mechanisms 
  of GSMPv3 for the support of optical switching. The GSMPv3 is an 
  asymmetric protocol to control and manage label switch. The label 
  switches that are used for optical switching are all optical cross-
  connects (optical-optical-optical), transparent optical cross 
  connects (optical-electrical-optical, frame independent), and opaque 
  optical cross connects (optical-electrical-optical, SONET/SDH 
  frames).These OXC (optical cross connect) systems can be IP-based 
  optical routers which are dynamic wavelength routers, optical label 
  switches, or burst/packet-based optical cross connects, and so on[2]. 
  In this draft, we do not limit specific OXC systems, but aims to 
  provide the general functions of optical switching and services for 
  connections in general optical switches.  
                        
  GSMPv3 is a label switch controller and provides a control interface 
  to optical switches. Therefore, it SHOULD define and add services for 
  optical switching and resource abstractions. The basic optical 
  resources used in connection setup are different with them of legacy 
  networks. In optical switching, basic connection units are a fiber, a 
  wavelength, or a burst and they are assumed to be processed in 
  optical domain without optical/electrical/optical conversion. It is 
  impossible to define services, traffic control, and QoS guarantee in 
  packet or cell level. New messages are needed to process optical 
  services, optical connection management, and so on, in real time 
  because optical switching requires real time process with low message 
  processing overhead. This draft describes optical resources, 
  connection management, optical services, and switch configuration 
  which can be applied in optical domain generally. 
                         
  One of the important OAM functions is protection and restoration 
  functions. In the current situation where a single fiber delivers 
  several Tb/s through several wavelengths, when even a single link 
  gets cut it makes a huge turbulence. Therefore GSMPv3, as an optical 
  switch controller, MUST have protection and restoration capabilities 
  of switches and connections. By extending the management messages of 
  GSMP, this function will be implemented. This draft also deals with 
  several recovery capabilities of the GSMPv3.

2. Common Definitions and Procedures for Optical Support. 
                      
  Common definitions and procedures which are not mentioned in this 
  document follow [1].  
                      
                      
2.1 Labels 
                        
  Labels are the basic identifiers for connections. In order to setup 
  connections in optical switch, new labels MUST be defined. Newly 
  defined labels identify entities that are to be switched in optical 
  switches. GMPLS defines packet switching capable, TDM switching 
  capable, lambdas switching capable, fiber switching capable 
  interfaces, and it introduces needs of generalized labels to support 
  them [3][4]. So far, GMPLS does not defined labels to be used for 
  optical switching (label formats and encoding schemes), but GSMPv3 
  MUST support all types of label that to be defined in GMPLS. The 
  following lists, especially related to lambda/fiber switch capable 
  interfaces, are the labels to be supported in optical switching 
  [2][3][4][7][8][10].      
                        
     - a single fiber in a bundle 
     - a single waveband within a waveband (or )fiber 
     - a single wavelength within a fiber 
     - an optical burst within a wavelength  
                        
  These labels can be encoded in a common structure composed of three 
  fields, a Type, a Length, and a Value [1]. TLV types for optical 
  support in GSMPv3 are not defined yet.  
                        
  All labels will be designated as follow: 
                        
      0                   1                   2                   3

     |                                                               | 
     ~                          Label Value                          ~ 
     |                                                               | 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
                        
  S: Stacked Label Indicator 
  S field is not used in this extended version of GSMPv3 because labels 
  for optical support only carry a single level of label [4].  
                        
  Label Type: 12 bit

  Label type for optical support MAY be identified with the above four 
  types of optical switching.  
  Label type for optical support is TBD. 
                        
  Label value: Variable 
  Carries label information. The interpretation of this field depends 
  on the type of the link (or the type of connection) over which the 
  label is used. Label value for optical support is TBD. 
                      
  The other fields are defined in [1] and referred in it. 
                        
                        
2.1.1 Labels for Fiber  
                        
  This label indicates a fiber to be used for a connection 
  establishment in optical switching. The label value only has 
  significance between two neighbors, and the receiver MAY need to 
  convert the received value into a value that has local significance.  
                        
  If the label type = labels for fiber, the label MUST be interpreted 
  as labels for fiber and the label for fiber has the following format: 
                        
      0                   1                   2                   3 
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
     |                             Label                             | 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
                        
  Label: 32 bits 
  Indicates a label for fiber to be used.  
  Label encoding is TBD. 
                        
                        
2.1.2 Labels for Waveband  
                        
  A waveband is a set of contiguous wavelengths which can be switched 
  together to a new waveband [3][4]. It MAY be desirable for an optical 
  cross connect to optically switch multiple wavelengths as a unit 
  since it MAY reduce distortion on individual wavelengths and MAY 
  allow tighter separation of individual wavelengths. Waveband 
  switching introduces another level of label hierarchy and as such the 
  waveband is treated the same way all other upper layer labels are 
  treated. The waveband label is defined to support such a waveband 
  switching. The waveband label can be encoded in three parts; waveband 
  ID, start label, and end label. The start label and the end label 
  represent the lowest value of wavelength and the highest value of 
  wavelengths.  
                        
  If the label type = labels for waveband, the label MUST be 
  interpreted as labels for waveband and the label for waveband has the 
  following format:

  A waveband identifier.  The value is selected by a sender and reused 
  in all subsequent related messages. 
                        
  Start Label: 32 bits 
  Indicates the lowest value of wavelength in the waveband. 
                       
  End Label: 32 bits

  The start/end label are established either by configuration or by  
  means of a protocol such as LMP [6]. They are normally used in the   
  label parameter of the Generalized Label one PSC and LSC [3][4]. 
                        
                        
2.1.3 Labels for Wavelength  
                        
  The label indicates a single wavelength to be used for a connection 
  establishment in optical switching. The label value only has 
  significance between two neighbors, and the receiver MAY need to 
  convert the received value into a value that has local significance.

  Optical data burst switching, which utilizes finer granularity in 
  time domain in a coarse granularity such as a wavelength, is a new 
  connection entity in optical domain [7][8]. Connection setup for 
  optical burst includes reserving time on the transport medium for the 
  client.  
                        
  This time is characterized by two parameters: start time and duration 
  of data burst. These values define a fast one-way reservation. Upon a 
  request for setup of a burst connection, the GSMP controller MUST 
  perform appropriate Connection Admission Control for the start time 
  and duration of data burst specified. If the connection is allowed, 
  it MUST signal these parameters to the burst switching device to 
  reserve the exact bandwidth required [7][8]. The burst switch MUST 
  perform the switching operation autonomously, using the 
  synchronization methods prescribed for the burst network it is 
  operating in.  
                        
  If the label type = labels for optical burst switching, the label 
  MUST be interpreted as labels for burst switching and a format of the 
  label for optical burst switching is given as the below:

  Label encoding is TBD.  
                        
                        
2.1.5 Label Range 
                        
  The basic label range to be used in each port is specified by the 
  Port Configuration or All Port Configuration message. The Label Range 
  message allows the range of labels supported by a specified port to 
  be changed. The controller MUST allocate the label range with 
  consideration of optical characteristics when assigning the labels 
  for a connection because a connection is established per optical 
  burst, wavelength, waveband, and fiber in optical domain. Since the 
  basic label range varies in switches and the labels for the 
  connections can be different due to the optical characteristics, GSMP 
  does not treat them. However, the following lists SHOULD be 
  considered and the available label ranges SHOULD be applied in the 
  Label Range message.  
                      
     - When allocating a label for a wavelength, the label SHOULD be 
     allocated with consideration of wavelength continuity. For 
     satisfying requirement of wavelength continuity in a connection, 
     the label SHOULD be allocated to maintain the same wavelength for

     it. The controller MUST manage the available labels and support 
     the constraint.  
                        
     - The labels to be used for waveband switching MUST be contiguous, 
     because the waveband switching is possible only in a set of 
     contiguous wavelengths. The decision mechanism for the available 
     label range is out of scope of GSMPv3.  
                       
     - GMPLS supports bi-directional symmetric LSPs setup [3][4]. To 
     setup a bi-directional LSP two unidirectional paths MUST be 
     independently established. For doing so, the presence of an 
     upstream label in the appropriate signaling message indicates the 
     bi-directional LSP setup and two labels are allocated for them. 
     The GSMPv3, therefore, SHOULD allow appropriate labels for them. 
     In order to avoid contention for labels, much care SHOULD be taken 
     in choosing the two labels. To choose the labels to avoid 
     contention is out of scope of GSMPv3.   
                        
                        
                        
3. Connection Management Messages 
                        
  Connection management messages, which are used for establishing, 
  releasing, modifying, and verifying connections across the switch by 
  the controller, SHOULD operate for optical switching. Since the 
  GSMPv3 does not process each packet in optical domain, traffic 
  related fields used to specify connections in the messages are not 
  dealt with and then it makes possible to process the message faster. 
  Connection management messages also SHOULD support restoration 
  capabilities of optical switch and these are mainly dealt with in the 
  following sub-sections. 

  The general message definition and semantics in this section follow 
  [1] and the other untouched items are dealt with in it. 

                        
                        
3.1 Add Branch Message 
                        
  The Add Branch message is used to setup a connection. Especially, it 
  SHOULD support restoration capability in optical switches.  For 1+1 
  dedicated recovery, it is required to make an additional connection 
  as a backup connection to protect an original connection against a 
  failure. Additional fields are not required in the Add Branch message 
  to support the restoration capability since two connections are used 
  for delivering data traffic simultaneously and an egress node selects 
  one of them. Since the two connections are established for one 
  connection, connection-related fields, such as input port/label, 
  output port/label, SHUOLD be carefully set in order to distinguish 
  them. The controller SHOULD know the whole status of the switch and 
  manage the information base.

  The message format and semantics in this section follows [1].  


3.5 Delete Branches Message 

  The message format and semantics in this section follows [1], and 
  optical switching related contents will be added.  
                        
                        
3.6 Move Output Branch Message 

  The Move Output Branch message is used to change the current output 
  port label to the new output port label for re-establishing the 
  existing connection. It can be used to support restoration capability. 
  Since to re-establish output port of a switch at an ingress node is 
  to change a start point of the current connection, it can be used for 
  1:1 dedicated recovery or 1:N (M:N) shared recovery where an ingress 
  node begins a connection and it takes responsibility for recovery of 
  the connection. Upon a fault occurring, in order to setup a new 
  backup connection for the failed working connection, the new port in 
  upstream node SHOULD be connected to the current connection by using 
  this message.  

  For configuring a new backup connection, the following fields of Move 
  Input Branch message SHOULD be set as following. 

     - Old Output Port = failed working connection's output port ID 
     - Old Output Label = failed working connection's output label ID 
     - New Output Port = newly configured reserved backup connection's 
                         output port ID 
     - New Output Port = newly configured reserved backup connection's 
                         output label ID 
                            
  This message is additionally used to move back to the original 
  connection from the backup connection in revertible mode after a 
  recovery completed. In this case, Old Output Port/Label are for the 
  currently used backup connection, and New Output Port/Label are for 
  the restored working connection

3.7 Move Input Branch Message 

  The Move Input Branch message is used to change the current input 
  port label to the new input port label for re-establishing the 
  existing connection. It is also used to support restoration 
  capability. For 1:1 dedicated recovery or 1:N (M:N) shared recovery, 
  the message can be used to configure backup connection at an egress 
  node. By setting Old Input Port/Label as a failed working connection 
  and New Input Port/Label as a reserved backup connection, recovery of 
  the failed working connections is achieved.  

  It is also used to move back to the original connection from a backup 
  connection for the revertible mode after a recovery completed. The 
  new port/label in this message sets that of the restored original 
  connection.  

  The other untouched items and fields in these messages are dealt with 
  in [1] and referred in it. 

                        
                        
4. Reservation Management Messages 

  The GSMPv3 allows a switch to reserve resources for connections 
  before establishing them through Reservation Management messages. 
  Reservable resources are bandwidth, buffers, queues, labels and etc. 
  In this extended version of GSMPv3 for optical support, the resources 
  imply optical resources, such as data burst, wavelengths, fibers, and 
  so on. 

  With these messages, restoration capabilities of a switch are 
  supported. Especially, in 1:N (M:N) shared recovery scheme, a spare 
  connection is reserved for N working connections. The GSMPv3 SHOULD 
  use the reservation request messages for reserving a backup 
  connection. The GSMPv3 controller SHOULD have mapping information 
  between a shared backup resource and N working connections. Whenever 
  the GSMPv3 uses the reserved resource for a failed working connection 
  Add Branch message is used to establish a new connection with New 
  Port/Label of one of N working connections.  

  Or any other cases, the reserved resources are used as followed in 
  [1]. The message format and semantics in this section follow [1] and 
  the other untouched items are dealt with in it. 


4.1 Reservation Request Message for optical burst 

  Reservation Request message SHOULD support new connections per data 
  burst, based on time-delayed reservation in optical domain. In order 
  to configure connection per burst, two parameters, offset time and 
  burst length, SHOULD be add on the message. When a controller

  receives a request for a burst connection setup it sends a 
  Reservation Request message with the two fields. The switch then 
  waits for offset time to establish the connection and then 
  automatically set it up. After burst length time, it releases the 
  connection.  

  Message type = TBA

5.2 Label Range Message 

  The label range, which is specified for each port by the Port 
  Configuration or the All Ports Configuration message, can be 
  specified to the range of label supported by a specified port and to 
  be changed by using Label Range message. Since the granularity of 
  each connection is different in optical domain each port SHOULD allow 
  the label range changeable in ports. In addition, a port MAY have 
  wavelength converters with full or limited capability so that each 
  port MAY have different limited labels. In case of waveband switching, 
  a single label for waveband connection is used for a set of 
  wavelengths in the band. To support these cases, the Label Range 
  message is used.  

  The general usage and massage format of this message follows [1]. 


5.2.1 Optical Label 

  If the Label Type is equal to optical label, the label range message 
  MUST be interpreted as an Optical Label. Label Range Message format

6. State and Statistics Messages 

  The State and Statistics messages allow a controller to request state 
  and statistics of connections of a switch. They SHOULD be extended to

  optical transmission characteristics which specify transmission QoS 
  of connections. Transmission performance is typically defined in 
  terms of signal performance with reference to noise level, or by the 
  signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and spectral occupancy requirement or

  The configuration messages allow a controller to discover a 
  capabilities of optical switch. Switch configuration, port 
  configuration, and service configuration messages are defined for 
  these functions.  


7.1 Optical Switch Configuration Message 

  Since an optical switch MAY be able to provide connection services at 
  multiple transport layers, and not all switches are expected to 
  support the same transport layers, the switch will need to notify the  
  controller of the specific layers it can support. Therefore, the 
  switch configuration message MUST be extended to provide a list of 
  the transport layers for which an optical switch can perform 
  switching. For supporting various types of switching capable 
  interfaces, Optical Switch Configuration Message SHOULD contain the 
  Switching Interface ID.

7.2 Port Configuration Message 

  The port configuration message informs a controller configuration 
  information related to a single port. Ports in optical switches 
  differ from those in electrical switches. The ports defined in GSMPv3 
  imply a single physical link and several connections are specified 
  with labels in a port. However, a single port does not identify a 
  single link in optical domain. A port can imply a set of fibers, a 
  single fiber, or a single wavelength. Therefore different types of 
  port SHOULD be identified in GSMPv3. Moreover, OXC can have many bays 
  which contain hundreds of shalves which have tens of thousands of 
  port. Therefore, physical bay and shelve identifiers also SHOULD be 
  defined and encoded in the port configuration message.  

  The basic format and usage of Port Configuration message follow [1]. 
  The following new port types are defined. In optical domain, PortType  
  can be classified into per fiber bundle containing several fibers, a 
  single fiber containing several wavelengths, or a single wavelength. 

  PortType = optical switching (TBA by IANA) 

  This port type further can be classified into several types as 
  following. 

  PortType = fiber in optical switching 
  PortType = wavelength in optical switching            
  ... 


7.2.1 PortType Specific Data for Optical Switching 

  The format and usage of Port Specific Data in Port Configuration 
  message depends on the PortType value and the basic format of it is 
  given as following [1].

           Subsection follow [1]. 
                        
  In this section, we specify some fields for supporting optical 
  switching as following. If PortType is equal to optical switching, 

  Receive Data Rate 
  The maximum rate of data that may arrive at the input port 
  (interface) in; 

  Bits/sec       for PortType = Optical Switching 

  Transmit Data Rate 
  The maximum rate of data that may depart from the output port 
  (interface) in; 

  Bits/sec       for PortType = Optical Switching 

  Line Type 
  The type of physical transmission interface for this port. The line 
  type for optical support depends on switching interface for each 
  switching entity, such as for wavelength-related port or fiber-
  related port. This field MAY define bit rate of wavelength, fiber 
  type. The following values can be identified for optical support.  

  PortType = Optical Switching:     TBD 

  Physical Slot Number 
  The physical location of the slot in optical switching (or OXC). 
  Since the OXC systems can have many bays which contain hundreds of 
  shelf which have tens of thousands of port this field SHLOULD 
  identify the slot. For doing so, the field MAY be partitioned into 
  several sub-fields to define bay, shelf, and slot. 


  The default label range block for optical switching has the 
  following format.

  Label Type: 12 bit  
  Label type for optical support. Each encoding type of the labels is 
  TBD. 

  Label value: Variable  
  Carries label information. The interpretation of this field depends 
  on the type of the link (or the type of connection) over which the 
  label is used. Min Label and Max label value imply the range of 
  available optical labels. Each encoding type of the labels is TBD. 


7.3 All Ports Configuration Message 

  The message format and usage of it follows [1], and optical 
  switching-related contents follow section 7.2.  


7.4 Service Configuration Message 

  The Service Configuration message requests an optical switch report 
  the configuration information of the supported services. The 
  requested services are identified in service ID in the Add Branch 
  message or the Reservation Management message. The service model is 
  defined with traffic parameter, QoS parameter, and traffic control 
  elements in [1], but these parameters can not be used to specify the 
  optical services. Therefore this message SHOULD be modified to 
  support optical services with newly defined capability sets. The 
  services supported at optical switches SHOULD be defined for dealing 
  with optical burst, wavelength, waveband, and fiber connection.  

7.4.1 Optical Service Configuration Message 

  TBD. 
                        
                        

8. Event Messages 

  The Event messages allow a switch to inform a controller of certain 
  asynchronous events. In this version of GSMPv3, asynchronous events 
  mainly deal with recovery-related events. The indication of these 
  asynchronous events related to ports and switch elements can inform 
  failure of them to the controller and it can initiate a fault 
  recovery mechanism. The basic message format and usage of it SHOULD 
  be referred to [1]. The two messages, Restoration Completion message 
  and Fault Notification message, are used to notify a controller 
  fault-related events of a switch.  


8.1 Restoration Completion Message

  For 1+1 dedicated recovery, a failed working connection is switched 
  over to another dedicated connection without a controller's 
  recognition. This message is used to inform the controller 
  restoration completion of the switch. This message contains failed 
  working connection ID and restored backup connection ID.  

  Message Type = TBA 

  If a message type is equal to Restoration Completion message the 
  following sub-TLVs SHOULD be added on the message in order to notify 
  restoration completion to a controller.

8.2 Fault Notification Message 

  This message is used to inform a controller a fault occurring in a 
  switch. The possible faults are link failure from cutting off 
  (affecting wavelengths, fibers, fiber bundles), port failure, or 
  switch modules. For the notification purpose, the following sub-TLV 
  SHOULD be added in Event message.  

  Message type = TBA 

  If a message type is equal to Fault Notification message the 
  following sub-TLV SHOULD be added on the message in order to notify a 
  fault in a switch to a controller.

10. Failure Response Codes 

  This chapter describes the failure and warning states which can occur 
  in setup optical connections. The following lists are the codes that 
  SHOULD be defined and added in the Failure Response messages. These 
  codes MAY be added more when the services for optical switching are 
  defined.  

  If the switch issues a failure response it MUST choose the most 
  specific failure code according to the following precedence. The code 
  numbers will be assigned in IANA. 

  Optical Connection Failure 

  - recovery failure 
      Due the limitation of available resource for backup connection, 
      for example, multiple links failure, the switch can not be 
      succeeded the recovery procedure for shared protected connection. 
                        
  - waveband connection setup failure 
      There are not available wavelengths which belong to the range of 
      min and max limits of the waveband 
                       
  - reservation failure for optical burst 
      In case of delayed reservation in time is not exactly matched, 
      the reservation of optical burst can be failed.  

  The following list gives a summary of the failure codes defined for 
  failure response messages: 

  - no available label for shortage of available wavelengths 
  - no available resource for recovery  
  - no available resource for waveband connection setup 
  - no match for the delayed reservation for optical burst connection

  This document does not have any security concerns. The security 
  requirements using this document are describes in the referenced 
  documents. 



Appendix I. Protection and Restoration Capability in GSMPv3 

  The GSMP controller MUST support the protection and restoration 
  capabilities because the optical switch delivers several Gbps data 
  traffic in a single wavelength. To achieve fast protection and 
  restoration, the optical switch is capable of taking an action 
  independent of the GSMP controller, then it informs the controller 
  after completing the restoration [2]. This differs from the master-
  slave relationship in GSMP.  

  Recovery mechanisms do not distinguish path (end-to-end) and link 
  recovery in GSMPv3. The difference of them is considered in signaling  
  protocol. In case of dynamically calculating the backup link after a 
  fault occurs, GSMPv3 establishes a new backup link by using the 
  existing Add Branch message. Therefore, this draft considers pre-
  planned recovery mechanisms, such as 1+1 dedicated recovery, 1:1 
  dedicated recovery with/without extra traffic, and 1:N/M:N shared  
  recovery.  

  The label switch SHOULD provide the protection and restoration 
  capabilities in order to provide the recovery mechanisms. For example, 
  an ingress/egress node reserves backup resources according the each 
  recovery mechanism, and setup the switch fabric. Then, GSMPv3 is used 
  to control the switch.  

  In this section, the recovery mechanisms which can be provided by 
  GSMPv3 is specified with including a fault notification, and 
  restoration, and related required messages. For example, the port 
  configuration command MUST be extended to allow autonomous protection 
  mechanism. The current GSMP connection management also MUST be 
  extended to support this function. In the following subsections, the 
  supported recovery mechanisms in GSMPv3 are introduced. 


1.1 1+1 dedicated recovery mechanism 

  In this recovery mechanism, GSMPv3 utilizes the existing Connection 
  Management messages. It is not necessary to notify a fault to the 
  controller and restore the failed working link at physical layer. 
  Then, the switch notifies the recovery completion to the controller 
  by using Event message. The recovery procedure of the mechanism 
  follows.  

  - Backup link configuration 
  Use Add Branch message as for working link.

  - Fault notification 
  Let physical layer process before GSMPv3 recognizes. 

  - Recovery procedure 
  Let physical layer process before GSMPv3 recognizes. 

  - After recovery completion;  
  Firstly, the switch notifies recovery completion to the controller by 
  using Restoration Completion message, then 
                        
     * Revertible mode; GSMPv3 uses Move Input message to switch the 
       currently used backup link to the restored working link at an 
       egress node. 
                        
     * Non-revertible mode; GSMPv3 deletes the restored working link by 
       using Delete Branch message, and then configures a new backup 
       link by using Add Branch message. 
                        
                        
1.2 1:1 dedicated recovery mechanism 

  - Backup link configuration 
  An ingress/egress node configure a backup link by using Reservation 
  Request message, and core nodes use Add Branch message to reserve 
  backup link. In this recovery mechanism, extra traffic can be 
  delivered through the backup link. If it could be possible, core 
  nodes use Reservation request message, not Add Branch message. 
  However this draft only considers the former case as this mechanism.   

  - Fault notification 
                           
     * Fault detected from signaling protocol; GSMPv3 have already 
       known the fault, it directly go into the recovery procedure.  
                       
     * Fault detected from the switch; Event message (esp. Fault 
       Notification message) is used to notify the fault to the 
       controller.  
                        
  - Recovery procedure 
  An ingress node uses Move Output message and an egress node used Move 
  Input message in order to configure a backup link. Since the backup 
  path is configured through the network, core nodes do not take any 
  action for recovery.  

  - After recovery completion 
  Firstly, the switch notifies recovery completion to the controller by 
  using Restoration Completion message, then 
                        
     * Revertible mode; GSMPv3 uses Move Input message (at an ingress 
       node) and Move Output message (at an egress node) to switch the 
       currently used backup link to the restored working link at

       destination node. The backup link is still used for backup by 
       using Reservation Request message.  
                        
     * Non-revertible mode; Delete Branch message can be used to delete 
       the restored working link. GSMPv3 uses Reservation Request 
       message to reserve new backup link for the working link.  
                        
                        
1.3 1:N/M:N shared recovery mechanism 

  - Backup link configuration 
  Reservation Request message is used to configure a backup link. Since 
  several working links (= N) share one backup link (1:N) or several 
  backup links (M:N) GSMPv3 SHUOLD know the sharing  working link IDs 
  for the backup links. Resource management of GSMPv3 is out of scope 
  of this draft.  

  - Fault notification 
                        
     * Fault detected from signaling protocol; GSMPv3 have already 
       known the fault, it directly go into the recovery procedure.  
                        
     * Fault detected from the switch; Event message (esp. Fault 
       Notification message) is used to notify the fault to the controller.  
                        
  - Recovery procedure 
  When GSMPv3 is notified a fault, it uses Add Branch message to 
  configure a new working link by using reserved backup link.  

  - After recovery completion 
  Firstly, the switch notifies recovery completion to the controller by 
  using Restoration Completion message, then 
                        
     * Revertible mode; GSMPv3 uses Move Input message (at an ingress 
       node) and Move Output message (at an egress node) to switch the 
       currently used backup link to the restored working link at 
       destination node. The backup link is still used for shared 
       backup by using Reservation Request message.  
                        
     * Non-revertible mode; Delete Branch message can be used to delete 
       the restored working link. GSMPv3 uses Reservation Request 
       message to reserve new backup link for the working link.  
                      
                      
Appendix II. GSMPv3 support for optical cross-connect system 

  The GSMPv3 controls and manages the optical cross-connect systems as 
  label switches. The optical cross-connect (OXC) is a space division 
  switch that can switch an optical data stream on an input port to an 
  output port. The OXCs are all optical cross-connects (optical-
  optical-optical), transparent optical cross connects (optical-
  electrical-optical, frame independent), and opaque optical cross

  connects (optical-electrical-optical, SONET/SDH frames).These OXC 
  (optical cross connect) systems can be IP-based optical routers which 
  are dynamic wavelength routers, optical label switches, or 
  burst/packet-based optical cross connects, and so on[2]. 

  The OXC system consists of switching fabric, multiplexer/ 
  demultiplexer, wavelength converter, and optical-electrical/ 
  electrical-optical converter. Multiple wavelengths are multiplexed or 
  demultiplexed into a fiber. Multiple fibers belong to a fiber bundle. 
  A wavelength, a waveband, and a fiber can be used to establish a 
  connection in an optical switch. They SHOULD be recognized at a port 
  in the OXC since they are connection entities. When the OXC has 
  optical-electrical conversion at the input port and electrical- 
  optical conversion at the output port it is called as opaque OXC. Or, 
  when it processes optical data stream all optically it is called as 
  transparent OXC. Wavelength converter SHOULD be used to resolve 
  output port contention when two different connections try to be 
  established in a same output port. Since the wavelength converter can 
  work only within a limited operating range, the limited numbers of 
  wavelengths are used at the output port. It limits the available 
  wavelengths at the output port.  

  If OXCs perform protection and restoration functions they SHOULD have 
  suitable switch structure to support them. In case of 1+1 dedicated 
  recovery, input ports and output ports MUST be duplicated in a switch. 
  The switch transmits optical signal through two ports (one for 
  working connection and another for backup connection) simultaneously. 
  When a fault happens the switch switches over from failed working 
  connection to dedicated backup connection without noticing a 
  controller.   

  In order to control and manage the OXC systems, GSMP SHOULD be 
  located as a subset of functions for it and MUST know the current 
  switch, port and service configuration information. GSMP controller 
  SHOULD identify the connection entities at the OXC and match them 
 with the optical labels.
