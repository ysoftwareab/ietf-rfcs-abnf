Abstract

   Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) has been developed
   by the IETF to facilitate the establishment of Label Switched Paths
   (LSPs) in a variety of physical technologies and across several
   architectural models. The ITU-T has specified an architecture for
   the management of Automatically Switched Optical Networks (ASON).

   This document provides a lexicography for the interpretation of GMPLS
   terminology within the context of the ASON architecture.

   It is important to note that GMPLS is applicable in a far wider set
   of contexts than just ASON. Thus the definitions presented in this
   document do not provide exclusive or complete interpretations of the
   GMPLS concepts. The intention of this document is simply to allow the
   GMPLS terms to be applied within the ASON context.

1. Introduction

   Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) has been developed
   by the IETF to facilitate the establishment of Label Switched Paths
   (LSPs) in a variety of physical technologies such as Packet Switching
   Capable (PSC), Layer Two Switching Capable (L2SC), Time Division
   Multiplexing (TDM), Lambda Switching Capable (LSC). and Fiber
   Switching Capable (FSC).

   GMPLS is deliberately specified to allow it to be applicable in
   several key architectures including the Integrated Model, the Overlay
   Model, and the Augmented Model. More information on these
   architectural models and on GMPLS can be found in [RFC3945].

   The ITU-T has specified an architecture for the management of
   Automatically Switched Optical Networks (ASON). This architecture
   forms the basis of many recommendations within the ITU-T.

   Because the GMPLS and ASON architectures were developed by different
   people in different standards bodies, and because the architectures
   have very different historic backgrounds (the Internet, and telephone
   and transport networks respectively), the terminology used is
   different. In order to demonstrate that GMPLS is a suitable
   technology to satisfy the requirements of the ASON architecture it is
   necessary to examine the terminology and provide a mapping between
   GMPLS and ASON terms.

   This document provides a lexicography for the interpretation of GMPLS
   terminology within the context of the ASON architecture. It does not
   provide wider definitions of the GMPLS terms which can already be
   found in existing RFCs. Thus the definitions presented in this
   document do not provide exclusive or complete interpretations of the
   GMPLS concepts. The intention of this document is simply to allow the
   GMPLS terms to be applied within the ASON context.

2. Terminology Sources

2.1. GMPLS Terminology Sources

   GMPLS Terminology is principally defined in [RFC3945]. Other
   documents provide further key definitions including [GMPLS-RTG],
   [BUNDLE], [LSP-HIER] and [LMP].

   The reader should be familiar with these other documents before
   attempting to use this document to provide a mapping to between GMPLS
   and ASON.

   For details of GMPLS signaling please refer to [RFC3471] and
   [RFC3473]. For details of GMPLS routing, please refer to [GMPLS-OSPF]
   and [GMPLS-ISIS].

2.2. ASON Terminology Sources

   The ASON architecture is specified in ITU-T Recommendation G.8080
   [G-8080]. This is developed from generic functional architectures and
   requirements specified in [G-805], [G-807] and [G-872].

   The reader must be familiar with these documents before attempting to
   apply the lexicography set out here.

2.3. Common Terminology Sources

   The work in this document builds on the shared view of ASON
   requirements and requirements expressed in [ASON-SIG], [ASON-RTG] and
   [TRANSPORT-LMP].

3. Lexicography






4. Guidance on the Application of this Lexicography


5. IANA Considerations

   This informational document defines no new code points and requires
   no action by IANA.

6. Management Considerations

   Both GMPLS and ASON networks require management. Both GMPLS and ASON
   specifications include considerable efforts to provide operator
   control and monitoring, as well as OAM functionality.

   These concepts are, however, out of scope of this document.

7. Security Considerations

   Security is also a significant requirement of both GMPLS and ASON
   architectures.

   Again, however, this informational document is intended only to
   provide a lexicography, and the security concerns are, therefore, out
   of scope.

8. Acknowledgements

   The authors would like to thank participants in the IETF's CCAMP
   working group and the ITU-T's Study Group 15 for their help in
   producing this document. In particular, all those who attended the
   Study Group 15 Question 14 Interim Meeting in Holmdel, New Jersey
   during January 2005.

9. Intellectual Property Consideration

   The IETF takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any
   Intellectual Property Rights or other rights that might be claimed to
   pertain to the implementation or use of the technology described in
   this document or the extent to which any license under such rights
   might or might not be available; nor does it represent that it has
   made any independent effort to identify any such rights. Information
   on the procedures with respect to rights in RFC documents can be
   found in BCP 78 and BCP 79.

   Copies of IPR disclosures made to the IETF Secretariat and any
   assurances of licenses to be made available, or the result of an
   attempt made to obtain a general license or permission for the use of
   such proprietary rights by implementers or users of this
   specification can be obtained from the IETF on-line IPR repository at
   http://www.ietf.org/ipr.

   The IETF invites any interested party to bring to its attention any
   copyrights, patents or patent applications, or other proprietary
   rights that may cover technology that may be required to implement
   this standard. Please address the information to the IETF at ietf-
