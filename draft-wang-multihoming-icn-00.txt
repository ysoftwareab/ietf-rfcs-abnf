1. Introduction

                   Software-Defined Networking (SDN)[RFC7149] gives operators
                   programmatic control over their networks. In SDN, the control plane
                   is physically separate from the forwarding plane, and one control
                   plane controls multiple forwarding devices. In SDN, a common, open,
                   vendor-agnostic interface between the control plane and the
                   forwarding plane, which may contain forwarding devices from
                   different hardware and software vendors, is required. OpenFlow is
                   such an interface.

                   Huawei presents the Protocol Oblivious Forwarding (POF) technology
                   Base on openFlow. The basic idea is to denote any protocol field,
                   as well as the metadata, which is considered as one special
                   protocol header that can be configured by the controller, with a
                   triad of <type, offset, length>.POF also defines a set of protocol
                   oblivious forwarding actions/instructions. The actions/instructions
                   can realize the functions of all forwarding instructions/actions
                   defined in OpenFlow, not only for the existing protocols but also
                   for any new protocols.With the protocol oblivious data plane that
                   are composed of POF forwarding devices,we will use POF to enable
                   information-centric networking (ICN).In the following content we
                   will use POF-ICN to refer to it.

                   On the other hand,Multihoming support on IP hosts can greatly
                   improve the user experience. With the simultaneous use of multiple
                   access networks, multihoming brings better network connectivity,
                   reliability,and improved quality of communication.compared to
                   tcp/ip network,we will discuss how to realize multihoming in POF-
                   ICN.

1.1 Treminology

                   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
                   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
                   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
                   [RFC2119].

                   Software-Defined Networking (SDN) - A programmable networks
                   approach that supports the separation of control and forwarding
                   planes via standardized interfaces.

                   Forwarding Plane (FP) - The collection of resources across all
                   network devices responsible for forwarding traffic.

                   Control Plane (CP) - The collection of functions responsible for
                   controlling one or more network devices.CP instructs network
                   devices with respect to how to process and forward packets.  The
                   control plane interacts primarily with the forwarding plane and, to
                   a lesser extent, with the operational plane.

                   Protocol Oblivious Forwarding (POF) - The protocol that is proposed
                   by Huawei to provide a new way to develop SDN.

2. Framework Benefit

                   To provide better multi-homed transmission services, POF-ICN
                   support for multi-hosting is reflected in the following aspects:

2.1 Forwarding speed

                  Forwarding speed of the forwarding plane is fast and the forwarding
                  path is controllable. Under the POF-ICN architecture, the control
                  plane is separate from the forwarding plane. The forwarding plane is
                  only responsible for simple flow table matching and data packet
                  forwarding, which greatly eases the switch processing burden.
                  Compared to the traditional TCP/IP architecture.Therefore, packet
                  forwarding is faster than traditional networks. On the other hand,
                  the flow entry on the switch is delivered by the POF controller, so
                  that the forwarding path can be controlled.multiple paths can be
                  used conveniently under multihoming scenario. In the traditional
                  network architecture, mutihoming needs to be implemented by using
                  multiple IP address pairs which is completely uncontrollable.

2.2 Control plane



               <Author>                Expires - April 2019                  [Page 4]
                                                                         October 2018


                   The control plane can select the optimal content source and get
                   the optimal transmission path. The POF controller in the POF-ICN
                   architecture manages the underlying forwarding devices. Each POF
                   controller can obtain the interconnection information of the
                   switches in its control domain through the virtual layer.it can
                   control the forwarding rules between switch by issuing the flow
                   table.This feature brings great convenience to multihoming
                   transmission. In scenarios where the user needs multihoming
                   transmission, the POF controller can calculate the position of the
                   content source closest to the user in the network according to the
                   topology information. The TCP/IP network can not achieve that. In
                   the TCP/IP network architecture, content can usually only be
                   acquired via a fixed ip address. In POF-ICN, it is possible to
                   obtain the required content through the network cache.

2.3 Session management

                  The session management module is introduced.In the POF-ICN, a
                   session management module is introduced to maintain the request
                   connection through the user network address and the request
                   content name so that it can provide a basis for further
                   optimization of the algorithm. In the POF-ICN multihoming
                   transmission scenario, the session management obtains connection
                   information through the POF controller.it will use optimization
                   algorithm to obtain the optimal forwarding strategy . Finally, the
                   best solution to the solution is fed back to the controller. The
                   controller controls the underlying switch Forwarding rules to
                   maximize link utilization in multihoming transmissions.

3. Framework overview

                  This document provides a POF-ICN multihoming transport framework, as
                  shown in Figure 1. In addition to the existing network entities
                  (such as base stations and mobile gateways, POF switches, etc.),
                  some logical entities are defined, namely Mobility Management Entity
                  (MME), POF controller, and session management.

                  Mobility management is responsible for the management of terminals
                  and hosts. Each time the terminal starts a service, it interacts
                  with the MME to obtain multiple available hosts and MME will
                  allocates access bandwidth. When it leaves, it will log out at the
                  MME and release the bandwidth. The MME will update the network




               <Author>                Expires - April 2019                  [Page 5]
                                                                         October 2018


                  conditions in real time, such as available bandwidth, available
                  hosts, access terminals, and so on.

                  Session management is responsible for the management and
                  transmission control of all multihoming services. The session
                  management firstly completes the access bandwidth allocation (host
                  resource management) through the interaction between the MME and the
                  terminal on the access side , then the controller completes path
                  planning and path bandwidth resource allocation on the ICN network
                  side. Session management implements a dynamic decision model by
                  randomly estimating the transmission rate and the transmission link
                  delay at both ends of the access switch and the content source
                  switch.

                  The POF controller is responsible for the transmission path planning.
                  According to the session management, a plurality of parallel paths
                  from the request side to the content source are planned for the
                  current network resources allocated by the multi-homed service, and
                  the path planning is implemented by issuing a flow table to the POF
                  switch of the forwarding plane.


4. Operation flow

                  The terminal in this example is equipped with WLAN and LTE
                  interfaces and is also equipped with multihoming features. It can
                  connect base stations and wireless POF switches The transmission
                  steps are as follows:

                  Step (1): The terminal is connected to multiple hosts such as a WLAN
                  and an LTE network.

                  Step (2): The host will register the access to the MME with the MME
                  and update it regularly

                  Step (3): When the terminal has service requirements, it needs to
                  report the service request first. Through the different access
                  networks, the current quality of service, network status, reported
                  to the MME; At the same time, the MME will periodically receive the
                  load of the cellular base station, Wi-Fi access point;

                  Step (4): After receiving the request, the MME considers the
                  different transmission characteristics of multiple wireless networks
                  and the respective network load conditions, and reasonably allocates
                  the services and resources among multiple networks, and sends the
                  resource allocation plan to the base station and The access point,
                  which simultaneously sends the distribution plan to the session
                  management module of the control plane

                  Step (5): The controller obtains the host and bandwidth allocated
                  for the terminal from the session management office,and parses the
                  location of the content source (possibly multiple), and combines the
                  above information to plan multiple paths between the terminal and
                  content source in the network topology.  It will send the result to
                  the session management module.

                  Step (6): According to the result of the bandwidth allocation, the
                  session management module establishes a dynamic decision process
                  according to the service requirements.it calculates an end-to-end
                  multi-path transmission strategy, and invokes the controller to
                  create a flow table.

                  Step (7): The controller delivers a flow table to the forwarding
                  plane

                  Step (8): When the terminal moves or the network is abnormal, the
                  session management cooperates with the MME and the controller to
                  update the access host and the transmission path

                  Step (9): update and deliver new flow tables
