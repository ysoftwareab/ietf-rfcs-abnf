Abstract

   Along with the current development of packet over lambda switching,
   there is considerable development in transport systems based on the
   ITU-T G.709 specification. For that purpose, the inter-working of
   G.709 capable devices on top lambda switched networks is relevant to
   new optical developments at the OIF and IETF.

   We propose to introduce the G.709 Optical Transport Hierarchy (OTH)
   defined at the ITU-T [ITUT-G709] into the label space of GMPLS.
   [GMPLS-ARCH] introduced the digital wrapper as an LSP encoding type
   for GMPLS. The objective of this draft is to specify additional

   extensions needed to support GMPLS [GMPLS-SIG] signalling for
   Optical Transport Networks (OTN) currently under definition at the
   ITU-T. These extensions indicate the bit rate and hierarchical layer
   relationships needed for transport over a G.709 OTN.

1. Introduction

   Recently, the ITU-T finalized the first version of the Optical
   Transport Networks (OTN) standardization [ITUT-G709] at the Network-
   to-Network Interface (NNI) to provide the transparent digital pipe
   (digital wrapper) to be associated with the optical channels.

   Soon, the multiplexing of lower bit-rate wavelength with ODU
   structure will come to provide granularity transmission (where
   needed) in the backbone network. Where low cost is the first goal,
   OTN provides a further degree of flexibility allowing the management
   of a relatively small all-optical sub-network (even if today with
   some limitations).

   At that point the OTN will have the two fundamental degrees of
   flexibility: in terms of wavelength and in terms of bandwidth
   transmission optimization without losing the integrity of the lower
   bit rates pipes filled by the access network.

   Unfortunately the expected flexible OTN architecture has today no
   explicit association with a control layer, without which the future
   deployment of OTN equipment is really questionable. In any case,
   [ITUT-G709] foresees some margins for future evolutions that could
   be taken into consideration for future explicit support of the
   control layer. The forthcoming Automated Switched Transport Network
   [ITUT-GASTN] should overcome the deployment at the boundary layer.

   GMPLS (as specified in [GMPLS-SIG], is today certainly the best
   candidate to provide the guidelines for the "control service" needed
   by the OTN. Moreover GMPLS may give today fundamental indications in
   terms of how OTN can be controlled and where something else (if
   needed) is to be added to the physical transmission level, which is
   open enough to hit the goal for the future intelligent optical
   networks.

2. Current Solutions

   In this section, we describe the G.709 specification foundations:

2.1 Pre-OTN DWDM Development

   ITU-T G709 describes also pre-OTN WDM development for backward
   compatibility with the state of the art of the equipments. Pre-OTN
   development has generated the current OTN development at the ITU-T
   but also the current all-optical development at the OIF and the
   IETF.

Draft-fontana-gmpls-control-g709-00.txt                  February 2001


   Pre-OTN DWDM has been developed during the last years in order to
   overcome the drawbacks of synchronous transmission. This development
   includes the definition of point-to-point DWDM optical channels on
   top of a mesh optical topology including Optical Cross-Connects
   (OXC) or Photonic Cross-Connects (PXC). A PXC is defined as an all-
   optical device (i.e. no O/E) and an OXC as a bit-rate transparent
   device (i.e. providing O/E/O conversion at each interface).

   The signalling paradigm developed for Lambda-switched LSP-capable
   networks has been included of the MPLS signalling paradigm. The MPLS
   generalization for fiber (space switching) lambda (wavelength
   switching), TDM (circuit switching) and packet LSPs (packet
   switching) is referred to as Generalized MPLS [GMPLS-SIG].

   The current bandwidth bottleneck is overcome by the use of DWDM
   systems. DWDM systems allow the multiplexing of more than 160
   wavelengths of 10 Gbps (1.6 Tbps per fiber with a 25 GHz spacing) by
   using the C-band and the L-band simultaneously. Some vendors are
   proposing a lambda spacing of only 12.5 GHz. Consequently, it will
   be possible to house 320 wavelengths of 10 Gbps in a single fiber
   (for a total throughput of 3.2 Terabits per fiber). Note that the
   ITU-T currently only specifies 50 GHz spacing in [ITUT-G692] within
   the so-called ITU-T Grid, in order to guarantee interoperability.

   In the pre-OTN application, client signals (STM-N, GbE, IP, etc.)
   are directly mapped on wavelength through the use of a mapping-
   framing variable-length layer. This means that this development does
   not include G.709 client-signal mapping definition through the
   definition of a dedicated framing protocol. OAM (Operation and
   Management) capabilities and signal quality monitoring are currently
   under definition in [IPO-LMP].

2.2 OTN Standard

   Optical networks are comprised of functionality providing transport,
   multiplexing, routing, supervision and survivability of client
   signals that are processed predominantly in the photonic domain.
   Optical signals are characterized by wavelength and may be processed
   per wavelength or as a wavelength division multiplexed group of
   wavelengths.

   The OTN model is decomposed into independent transport network
   layers where each network layer can be separately partitioned in a
   way that reflects the internal structure of that network layer.
   So that the Optical Transport Network (OTN) layered structure is
   defined as follows:
   -Optical Transmission Section (OTS) layer: This network layer
     provides functionality for transmission of optical signals on
     optical media of various types. This layer ensures the integrity
     and maintenance of the optical transmitted signal by overhead
     processing
   - Optical Multiplex Section (OMS) layer: This network layer provides
     functionality for networking of a multi-wavelength optical signal.

Draft-fontana-gmpls-control-g709-00.txt                  February 2001


     A "multi-wavelength" signal includes the case of just one optical
     channel. This layer ensures the integrity and maintenance of the
     multi-wavelength signal by overhead processing.
  @ Optical Channel (OCh) Layer: this network layer provides end-to-
     end networking of optical channels for transparently conveying
     client information of various formats (e.g. SDH STM-N, ATM, IP,
     etc.). The capabilities of this network layer concern with
     connection rearrangement for flexible routing, overhead
     processing, administration and maintenance functions.

   For the three layers specified above, non-associated overhead is
   transported via the Optical Supervisory Channel (OSC) in order to
   manage the optical connectivity. It has to be noted that these three
   layers are common to both pre-OTN and OTN applications.

   As far as the client handling is concerned, the OCH layer is further
   layered as follows:
  @ The Optical Transport Unit (OTUk) provides FEC capabilities and
  optical section protection and monitoring capabilities.
  @ The Optical Data Unit (ODUk) layer provides client independent
  connectivity, connection protection and monitoring (also without the
  need to terminate the overhead information).
  @ Clients signals i.e. STM-N signals, IP packets, ATM cells and
  Ethernet frames are mapped (meaning digitally wrapped) into a new
  structured frame defined as Optical Payload Unit (OPU).

   For each of the three layers specified above, an associated (in
   band) overhead carrying the management information is added inside
   the framed structure itself.

   The need for the development of a hierarchical transport (i.e.
   transport networking layer) is required for the following reasons:
   - Next step (after TDM - SDH/SONET) to support ever growing data
   driven needs for bandwidth and emergence of new broadband services
   - Support next generation Terabit/second per fiber via DWDM lines at
   the transport level as well as optical channels at 2.5 Gb/s, 10 Gb/s
   and 40 Gb/s bit rates wire speed level.
   - To provide network operational management, planning,
   administration, survivability, and finally cost of maintenance
   limited only to the OTUk/ODUk rates of transmission without caring
   about the granularity of the client signal.

3. Optical Transport Networks


   The OTN specifies an Optical Transport Hierarchy (OTH) supporting
   the operation and management aspects of optical networks of various
   architectures such as point-to-point, ring and mesh architectures.

   The G.709 specification defines the interfaces of the OTN to be used
   within and between sub-networks of the optical network, in terms of:
   - Optical Transport Hierarchy (OTH)

Draft-fontana-gmpls-control-g709-00.txt                  February 2001


   - functionality of the overhead in support of multi-wavelength
   optical sub-networks
   - frame structures
   - bit rates
   - formats for mapping client signals

   The OTN interfaces specifications can be applied at User to Network
   Interfaces (UNI) and Network Node Interfaces (NNI) of the OTN. The
   overhead functionality necessary for operations and management of
   optical sub-networks is also defined. For interfaces used within
   optical sub-networks, the aspects related to the interface depend on
   the optical technology progress and so are not covered by G.709
   recommendation. This is within the scope of other ITU-T
   recommendations [ITUT-G959.1].

3.1 Optical Transport Hierarchy (OTH)

   The Optical Transport Hierarchy (OTH) structure is defined as
   specified in [ITUT-G.872] that defines the Optical Channel (OCH)
   layer. The OTH further sub-structured the OCh layer in sub-layer
   networks in order to support the network management and supervision
   functions such as:

   - The Optical Channel with full (OCh) or reduced functionality
   (OChr), provides transparent network connections between 3R
   regeneration points in the OTN.

   - The fully standardized Optical Channel Transport Unit-k (OTUk)
   which provides supervision and conditions the signal for transport
   between regeneration points in the OTN (1R, 2R and for pre-OTN only,
   3R).

   - The Optical Channel Data Unit (ODUk) which provides
        . tandem connection monitoring (ODUk-TCM),
        . end-to-end path monitoring (ODUk-PM)

  - The Optical Channel Payload Unit (OPUk) which provides adaptation
   of client signals

   The Optical Transport Module-n (OTM-n) is the information structure
   used to support OTN interfaces. Two OTM-n structures are defined:
   - OTM interfaces with full functionality (OTM-n.m)
   - OTM interfaces with reduced functionality (OTM-0.m, OTM-nr.m)

   The reduced functionality OTM interfaces are defined with 3R
   processing at each end of the OTN.

3.1.1 Full Functional Stack

   The full functional stack (OTM n.m) is defined as follows:

   Up to n OCCr are multiplexed into an OCG-nr.m using wavelength
   division multiplexing. The OCCr tributary slots of the OCG-nr.m can
   be of different size. The OCG-nr.m is transported via the OTM-nr.m.

   For the case of the full functionality OTM-n.m interfaces, the OSC
   is multiplexed into the OTM-n.m using wavelength division
   multiplexing.

3.1.2 Reduced Functionality Stack: OTM-0.r and OTM-nr.m

   The OTM with reduced functionality could be either
   - OTM-0: consists of a single optical channel without a specific
   wavelength assigned (see Figure)
   - OTM-nr.m: consists of up to n multiplexed optical channels. Non
   associated overhead is not supported (see Figure)

   The OTM-nr.m/OTM-0 is the information structure used to support
   Optical Physical Section (OPS) layer connections in the OTN.

   The order of an OTM-nr is defined by the order of the OCG-nr that it
   supports. Note that the first version of G.709, only includes
   reduced functionality for standardized inter-domain interfaces
   (IrDI).

3.2 Signal Types

   Signal types defined by the [ITUT-G709] specification can be divided
   in Optical Channel Unit layer and Optical Transport Module (OTM).
   The Payload Unit layer can itself be sub-divided in OCh Payload
   Unit, OCh Data Unit and OCh Transport Unit. The Appendix 1 describes
   the indexes used within the [ITUT-G709] terminology.

3.2.1 OPUk Signal

   Optical channel Payload Unit (OPU) is defined as a structured signal
   of order k (k = 1, 2, 3) and referred to as OPUk signal. The OPUk
   frame structure is organized in an octet based block frame structure
   with 4 rows and 3810 columns. The two main areas of the OPUk frame
   (4 x 3810 Bytes) are the OPUk Overhead area (column 15 and 16) and
   OPUk Payload area (columns 17 to 3824).

3.2.2 ODUk Signal

   Optical channel Data Unit (ODU) is defined as a structured signal of
   order k (k = 1, 2, 3) and referred to as ODUk signal. The ODUk frame
   structure is organized in an octet based block frame structure with
   4 rows and 3824 columns. The two main areas of the ODUk frame are
   ODUk Overhead area (columns 1 to 14 with column 1 dedicated to FA
   and OTUk specific alignment) and OPUk area (Columns 15 to 3824 which
   are dedicated to the OPUk area).

3.2.3 OTUk Signal

Draft-fontana-gmpls-control-g709-00.txt                  February 2001


   Optical channel Transport Unit (OTU) of order k (k = 1, 2, 3)
   defines the conditioning for transport over an Optical Channel
   network connection. This signal is referred to as OTUk signal. The
   OTUk (k=1,2,3) frame structure is based on the ODUk frame structure
   and extends it with a forward error correction (FEC). Scrambling is
   performed after FEC computation and insertion into the OTUk signal.

   In the OTUk signal, 256 columns are added to the ODUk frame for the
   FEC and the reserved overhead bytes in row 1, columns 9 to 14 of the
   ODUk overhead are used for OTUk specific overhead, resulting in an
   octet based block frame structure with 4 rows and 4080 columns (4 x
   4080 bytes).

3.2.4 OTM Module

   The OTM-n supports n optical channels on a single fiber with 3R
   regeneration and termination of the OTUk signal on each end. As 3R
   regeneration is performed on both sides of the OTM-0.m and OTM-nr.m
   interfaces access to OTUk overhead is available and maintenance as
   well as supervision of the interface is provided via this overhead.
   Therefore non-associated OTN overhead is not required across the
   OTM-0.m and OTM-nr.m interfaces. Consequently, Optical Supervisory
   Channel (OSC) and OTM Overhead Signal (OOS) are not supported.

   In the first G.709 version, only two OTM interfaces classes with
   reduced functionality are defined, OTM-0.m and OTM-16r.m.

   1. OTM-16r.m Interface

   The OTM-16r.m interface supports 16 optical channels (n = 16) on a
   single optical span with 3R regeneration at each end. Six OTM-16r
   interface signals are currently defined.

   The OTM-16r.m signal is an OTM-nr.m signal with 16 Optical Channel
   Carriers (OCCr) numbered OCCr #0 to OCCr #15. An Optical OSC is not
   present and there is no OOS either.

   At least one of the OCCrs is in service during normal operation and
   transporting an OTUk. However, there is no predefined order in which
   the OCCrs are taken into service.

   There are six defined OTM-16r.m interface signals and the OTM-16r.m
   multiplexing structure.

   Note: OTM-16r.m OPS overhead is not defined. The interface will use
   the OTUk SMOH in this multi-wavelength interface for supervision and
   management. OTM-16r.m connectivity failure (TIM) reports will be
   computed from the individual OTUk reports by means of failure
   correlation in fault management.

   2. OTM-0.m Interface

Draft-fontana-gmpls-control-g709-00.txt                  February 2001


   The OTM-0.m supports a single wavelength optical channel on a single
   optical fiber with 3R regeneration at each end. Three OTM-0.m
   interface signals are defined (with m = 1,2,3), each carrying a
   single channel optical signal containing one OTUk (with k = 1, 2, 3)
   signal. There is neither OSC defined nor OOS for OTM-0.m.

   For instance, the OTM16 can be separated in several cases:
   - the OTM16.0 (with up to 16 wavelengths mixing possibly bit-rates)
   - the OTM16.1 (with up to 16 wavelengths only at 2.5Gbits/s)
   - the OTM16.2 (with up to 16 wavelengths only at 10Gbits/s)
   - the OTM16.3 (with up to 16 wavelengths only at 40Gbits/s)

3.2.5 ODUk Multiplexing

   ODUk TDM Multiplexing will be included in the future release of
   G.709. Note that ODUk and OTUk still remain in the electrical domain
   but referred to as Optical Channel layer within [ITUT-G709].

   Two levels of multiplexing could be defined: four ODU1 can be
   multiplexed in one ODU2, and four ODU2 can be multiplexed in one
   ODU3.

4. Client Signal Mapping

   The specification of the Client-layer signal encapsulation in the
   OPU layer has been provided through the definition of different
   solutions depending upon the type of Client-layer signal.

4.1 Packet Mapping

   IP and Ethernet packet mapping is defined by the G.709 specification
   through the use of the Generic Framing Procedure (GFP). This (new)
   framing has been specified in order to avoid the use of Ethernet
   framing or SDH/Sonet in order to encapsulate IP packets and other
   types of packet (such as ESCON, Fiber Channel, etc.).

   GFP is defined as a generic mechanism to transport any client layer
   over a fixed data-rate optical channels (specifically, the so-called
   OTN ODU of unit-k). This means that GFP idle frames must be
   generated when the client layer does not send data packet.
   Consequently the service offered to the client packet layer is
   strictly equivalent to the one offered in SDH.

   The Generic Framing Procedure (GFP) frame format is defined as:

   +----------+--------------------------------------------+----------+
   |  Header  |             Payload                        |   FCS    |
   | 4 bytes  |         4 û 65535 bytes                    | Optional |
   +----------+--------------------------------------------+----------+

   The header (4-bytes) is composed by a PDU Length Indicator (PLI) of
   2 bytes and a HEC (Header Error Control) of 2 bytes.

   The GFP Idle frame format is defined as:

   +----------+
   |Idle Frame|
   |  4bytes  |
   +----------+

   A idle GFP frame includes a NULL PLI and a HEC of 2 bytes

   GFP defines also two basic frame-oriented mechanisms:

   1. GFP Frame Multiplexing: the GFP frame multiplexing is performed
   on a frame-by-frame basis. When no frames are waiting, idle frames
   are inserted.

   2. GFP Frame Delineation Algorithm: as defined for cell delineation,
   GFP frame delineation is based on the detection of correct HEC. PLI
   is used to find the start of the next frame.

   The GFP frames constitute the OPUk payload. The corresponding OPUk
   overhead is defined as follows by the Payload Structure Identifier
   (PSI) which includes the following fields:
   - PT: Payload Type (1-byte)
   - RES: Reserved (254-bytes)

   The GFP OPUk (k = 1, 2, 3) capacity are defined such that they can
   include the following client bit rates:
   - GFP (OPU1):  2 488 320 kbit/s
   - GFP (OPU2):  9 995 276 kbit/s
   - GFP (OPU3): 40 150 519 kbit/s

   Aligning the byte structure of every GFP frame with the byte
   structure of the OPUk Payload performs the mapping of GFP frames.
   Since the GFP frames are of variable length (the mapping does not
   impose any restrictions on the maximum frame length), a frame may
   cross the OPUk frame boundary.

   GFP frames arrive as a continuous bit stream (Idle frames when no
   client packets) with a capacity that is identical to the OPUk
   payload area, due to the insertion of Idle frames at the GFP
   encapsulation stage. Note that here, the GFP frame stream is
   scrambled during encapsulation.

   As currently defined in [ITUT-G709], GFP provides also ATM Constant
   Bit Rate (CBR) û by using ATM cell multiplexing - and TDM Circuits
   Encapsulation and mapping into the OPUk payload area.

4.4 OCh Encapsulation

   An overhead is associated to the OPUk, the ODUk and the OTUk
   signals. Moreover, the OTUk signal can include a tailer FEC.

   The control non-associated overhead at the lower OCh level is
   multiplexed within the OOS and then inserted to the Optical
   Supervisory Channel.

   The optical channel network-layer overhead bytes defined in [ITUT-
   G.709] support the following capabilities:
   @ Forward Error Correction (FEC)
   @ Performance Monitoring (PM)
   @ Network Fault localization
   @ Network Restoration Signaling
   @ Network General Communications Channels (GCC)
   @ Manufacturer-Specific Communications Channel

5. GMPLS Extensions for G.709

   Adapting GMPLS to control G.709 (also previously known as the
   "Digital Wrapper") seems straightforward. Note that G.709 defines
   indeed two layers. First, an electrical layer (the old "Digital
   Wrapper"), aka the Optical Channel Network Layer, indeed a new TDM
   technology. Second, a photonic layer (with a digital OTN Overhead
   Signal: OOS), i.e. a non-associated overhead.

Draft-fontana-gmpls-control-g709-00.txt                  February 2001


   GMPLS extensions for G.709 need to cover the Generalized Label
   Request, the Generalized Label as well as specific fields currently
   assigned to the SDH/Sonet labels. Since the electrical multiplexing
   will be added soon, in the next version, we could already have a
   label for that purpose, so that GMPLS could already consider the
   requirements for G.709.

   As specified already mentioned for GMPLS-over-SDH/Sonet [GMPLS-SDH],
   since GFP is only used as a framing protocol we donÆt consider the
   transport of MPLS label within this layer. Rather as defined for
   Packet-over-SDH/Sonet, we directly use the G.709 OTH in order to
   define the label space.

5.1 Generalized Label Request

   The Generalized Label Request [GMPLS-SIG] currently includes the LSP
   Encoding Type (i.e. Digital Wrapper) needed in order to enable the
   deployment of GMPLS signalling on top of G.709 networks.

   For that purpose, a new G.709 specific Generalized Label Request
   needs to be defined. The information carried in a Generalized Label
   Request for G.709 is:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      | LSP Enc. Type | Transparency  |             G-PID             |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |             Reserved          |  Signal Type  |  OOS  |  Resv |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   As mentioned here above, we suggest here to adapt the LSP Encoding
   Type (section 3.1.1) and the GPID to G.709:

   - LSP Encoding Type (see section 3.1.1 [GMPLS-SIG])

    The current "Digital Wrapper" (DW) code could be replaced by two
    separate codes:
       - code for the G.709 Optical Channel Network Layer.
       - code for a generic DW (for proprietary implementations).

    In the same way, the "Lambda" code could be replaced by two
    separate codes:
       - code for the G.709 optical layer.
       - code for a generic lambda layer (transparent).

    The code for the G.709 optical layer will indicate the capability
    of an end-system to use the G.709 non-associated overhead (i.e. the
    OOS).

   - Transparency Type: (See Section 3.1.1 [GMPLS-SIG])

Draft-fontana-gmpls-control-g709-00.txt                  February 2001


    This vector of flags (8 bits) indicates the type of transparency
    being requested. It is only applicable to the G.709 Optical Channel
    Network Layer. Note that the transparency does not change the bit
    rate. This field is zeroed if only the G.709 optical layer is used.

    Bit 1: indicates ODU transparency. This means that the ODU overhead
    cannot be modified.

    Bit 2: indicates OTU transparency. This means that the OTU overhead
    and the ODU overhead cannot be modified.

   - Signal Type: (See Section 3.1.1 [GMPLS-SIG])

    This field (8 bits) indicates the requested G.709 signal type. The
    possible values are:

      Value    Type
      -----    ----
        0      irrelevant
        1      2.5 Gbps
        2      10 Gbps
        3      40 Gbps

    This field may equal to zero if only the G.709 optical layer is
    used.

   - OOS (OTN Overhead Signal) Type:

    This field (4 bits) indicates the type of OOS for the G.709 optical
    layer. Possible values are:

      Value    Type
      -----    ----
        0      irrelevant
        1      OOS reduced functionality (limited overhead)
        2      OOS full overhead

5.2 Generalized Label

   G.709 at the Optical Channel Network layer defines three different
   client payload bit rates.  An Optical Data Unit (ODU) frame has been
   defined for each of these bit rates. ODUk refers to the frame at bit
   rate k, where k = 1 (for 2.5 Gbps), 2 (for 10 Gbps) or 3 (for 40
   Gbps). Two levels of multiplexing could be defined: four ODU1 can be
   multiplexed in one ODU2, and four ODU2 can be multiplexed in one
   ODU3.

   The G.709 Optical Channel Network Layer label has the following
   format:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

     |                     Reserved                      | k2  | k1  |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      k1: 0 -> 4: indicates a particular ODU1 in one ODU2.
      k2: 0 -> 4: indicates a particular ODU2 in one ODU3.

   If k1 and k2 are equal to zero means non-significant: a particular
   ODUk is not structured, i.e. ki=0 indicates that the ODUi+1 in not
   structured.

   Examples:

   k2=0, k1=0 indicates a full ODU3 (full 40 Gbps).
   k2=2, k1=0 indicates the second unstructured ODU2 in the ODU3.
   k2=4, k1=2 indicates the second ODU1 of the fourth ODU2 in the ODU3.

5.3 In-band/In-fiber GMPLS Signalling Transport

   Furthermore, standardization is required within ITU-T to define an
   in-fiber/in-band signaling transport mechanism through an OTN. We
   propose the allocation of a General Communication Channel (GCC),
   particularly GCC1, within the optical layer overhead, to transport
   the GMPLS signalling.

6. Security Considerations

   Security considerations are left for further study.

13. Appendix 2 û G.709 Indexes

   - Index k: The index "k" is used to represent a supported bit rate
   and the different versions of OPUk, ODUk and OTUk. k=1 represents an
   approximate bit rate of 2.5 Gbit/s, k=2 represents an approximate
   bit rate of 10 Gbit/s and k = 3 an approximate but rate of 40
   Gbit/s. The exact bit-rate values are in kbits/s:
    . OPU: 2 488 320.000, 9 995 276.962, 40 150 519.322
    . ODU: 2 498 775.126, 10 037 273.924, 40 319 218.983
    . OTU: 2 666 057.143, 10 709 225.316, 43 018 413.559

   - Index m: The index "m" is used to represent the bit rate or set of
   bit rates supported on the interface. This is a one or more digit
   ôkö, where each ôkö represents a particular bit rate. The valid
   values for m are (1, 2, 3, 12, 123, 23).

   - Index n: The index "n" is used to represent the order of the OTM,
   OTS, OMS, OPS, OCG and OMU. This index represents the maximum number
   of wavelengths that can be supported at the lowest bit rate
   supported on the wavelength. It is possible that a reduced number of
   higher bit rate wavelengths are supported. The case n=0 represents a
   single channel without a specific wavelength assigned to the
   channel.

   - Index r: The index "r", if present, is used to indicate a reduced
   functionality OTM, OCG, OCC and OCh (non-associated overhead is not
   supported). Note that for n=0 the index r is not required as it
   implies always reduced functionality.
