1.  Introduction

   Multiple techniques have been developed and deployed to improve
   service guarantees, both for multicast video traffic and Video on
   Demand traffic.  Most existing solutions are geared towards finding
   an alternate path around one or more failed network elements (link,
   node, path failures).

   This draft describes a mechanism for minimizing packet loss in a
   network when node or link failures occur.  Multicast only Fast Re-
   Route (MoFRR) works by making simple changes to the way selected
   routers use multicast protocols such as PIM.  No changes to the
   protocols themselves are required.  With MoFRR, multicast routing
   protocols don't necessarily have to depend on or have to wait on
   unicast routing protocols to detect network failures.

   MoFRR involves transmitting a multicast join message from a receiver
   towards a source on a primary path and transmitting a secondary
   multicast join message from the receiver towards the source on a
   backup path.  Data packets are received from the primary and
   secondary paths.  The redundant packets are discarded at topology
   merge points using RPF checks.  When a failure is detected on the
   primary path, the repair occurs by changing the interface on which
   packets are accepted to the secondary interface.  Since the repair is
   local, it is fast - greatly improving convergence times in the event
   of node or link failures on the primary path.

2.  Basic Overview

   MoFRR uses standard PIM JOIN/PRUNE messages to set up a primary and a
   secondary multicast forwarding path by establishing a primary and a
   secondary RPF interface on each router that receives a PIM join.  The
   outgoing interface list remains the same.

   Data packets are received from the primary and backup paths.
   Redundant packets received on the secondary RPF interface are
   discarded because of an RPF failure.  When the router detects a
   forwarding failure in the primary path, it changes RPF to the
   secondary path and immediately has packets available to forward out
   each outgoing interface.

   The primary and secondary MoFRR forwarding paths should not use the
   same nodes or links.  This may be configured or determined by
   computations described in this document.

   Note, the impact of additional amount of data on the network is
   mitigated when group membership is densely populated.  When a part of
   the network has redundant data flowing, join latency for new joining
   members is reduced because joins don't have to propagate far to get
   to on-tree routers.


3.  Topologies for MoFRR

   MoFRR works best in topologies illustrated in the figure below.
   MoFRR may be enabled on any router in the network.  In the figures
   below, MoFRR is shown enabled on the Provider Edge (PE) routers to
   illustrate one way in which the technology may be deployed.

         FIG1. Two-Plane Network Design


   The topology has two planes, a primary plane and a secondary plane
   that are fully disjoint from each other all the way into the POPs.
   This two plane design is common in service provider networks as it
   eliminates single point of failures in their core network.  The links
   marked PJ indicate the normal path of how the PIM joins flow from the
   POPs towards the source of the network.  Multicast streams,
   especially for the densely watched channels, typically flow along
   both the planes in the network anyways.

   The only change MoFRR adds to this is on the links marked SJ where
   the PE routers send a secondary PIM joins to their ECMP neighbor
   towards the source.  As a result of this, each PE router receives two
   copies of the same stream, one from the primary plane and the other
   from the secondary plane.  As a result of normal multicast RPF checks
   the multicast stream received over the primary path is accepted and
   forwarded to the downstream links.  The copy of the stream received

Internet-Draft                    MoFRR                       March 2009


   on the secondary path is discarded.

   When a router detects a routing failure on its primary RPF interface,
   it will switch to the secondary RPF interface and accept packets on
   that stream.  If the failure is repaired the router may switch back.
   The primary and secondary path have only local context and not end-
   to-end context.

   As one can see, MoFRR achieves the faster convergence by pre-building
   the secondary multicast tree and receiving the traffic on that
   secondary path.  The example discussed above is a simple case where
   there are two ECMP paths from each PE device towards the source, one
   along the primary plane and one along the secondary.  In cases where
   the topology is asymmetric or is a ring, this ECMP nature does not
   hold, and additional rules have to be taken into account to choose
   when and where to send the secondary PIM joins.

   MoFRR is appealing in such topologies for the following reasons:

   1.  Ease of deployment and simplicity: the functionality is only
       required on the PE devices although it may be configured on all
       routers in the topology.  Furthermore, each PE device can be
       enabled separately.  PEs not enabled for MoFRR do not see any
       change or degradation.  Inter-operability testing is not required
       as there is no PIM protocol change.

   2.  End-to-end failure detection and recovery: any failure along the
       path from the source to the PE can be detected and repaired with
       the secondary disjoint stream.

   3.  Capacity Efficiency: as illustrated in the previous example, the
       PIM trees corresponding to IPTV channels cover the backbone and
       distribution topology in a very dense manner.  As a consequence,
       the secondary joins graft into the normal PIM trees (ie. trees
       signaled by PIM without MoFRR extension) at the aggregation level
       and hence do not demand any extra capacity either on the
       distribution links or in the backbone.  They simply use the
       capacity that is normally used, without any duplication.  This is
       different from conventional FRR mechanisms which often duplicate
       the capacity requirements (the backup path crosses links/nodes
       which already carry the primary/normal tree and hence twice as
       much capacity is required).

   These properties are highly dependent on the topology: the existence
   of at least two disjoint paths from the source to the PE implementing
   the MoFRR behavior.

   We consider hereafter three types of PE connectivity:

   1.  The PE has two ECMP disjoint paths to the source.  This is a
       common case when the PE and the source are dual-homed to two
       aggregation routers, each ones belonging to two different planes
       of a two-plane backbone design.  One could picture this case as
       the triangle.  ECMP-mode MoFRR enables a PE to receive the same
       PIM tree from both interfaces.

                                Source
                                /    \

                                 \  /
                                  PE

                        FIG2. ECMP-mode MoFRR


   2.  The PE has one single path to the source.  A neighbor has a
       disjoint path to that source.  This is common when the source is
       dual-homed to the two planes while the PE is only connected to
       one plane directly, and to the other plane via another PE.  One
       could picture this case as the square.  Non-ECMP-mode MoFRR
       enables a PE to receive the same PIM tree from both interfaces.


                                Source
                                /    \
                            Plane1  Plane2
                               |      |
                               A1    A2
                               |      |

                      FIG3. Non-ECMP-mode MoFRR


   3.  The PE is part of a ring of PEs.  This ring is attached to the
       two planes via two aggregation routers.  Each one being in a
       different plane.  PEs on the left side of the ring have a
       clockwise path to the source while PEs on the right side of the
       ring use an anti-clockwise path.  Ring-mode MoFRR enables a PE to
       receive the same PIM tree from both direction.

4.  Detecting Failures

   Once the two paths are established, the next step is detecting a
   failure on the primary path to know when to switch to the backup
   path.

   A first option consists of comparing the packets received on the
   primary and secondary streams but only forwarding one of them -- the
   first one received, no matter which interface it is received on.
   Zero packet loss is possible for RTP-based streams.

   A second option assumes a minimum packet rate for a given data
   stream.  If a packet is not received on the primary RPF within this
   time frame, the router assumes primary path failure and switches to
   the secondary RPF interface. 50msec switchover is possible.

   A third option leverages the significant improvements of the IGP
   convergence speed.  When the primary path to the source is withdrawn
   by the IGP, the MoFRR-enabled router switches over to the backup
   path, the RPF interface is changed to the secondary RPF interface.
   Since the secondary path is already in place, convergence times would
   not include the time required to build a new tree and hence are
   smaller.  Realistic availability requirements (sub-second to sub-
   200msec) should be possible.


5.  ECMP-mode MoFRR

   If the IGP installs two ECMP paths to the source and if the (S, G)

   PIM state is enabled for ECMP-Mode MoFRR, the router installs them as
   primary RPF and secondary RPF.  It sends a PIM join to both RPF
   entries.  Only packets receive from the primary RPF entry are
   processed.  Packets received from the secondary RPF are dropped
   (equivalent to an RPF failure).

   The selected primary RPF interface should be the same as if MoFRR
   extension was not enabled.

   If more than two ECMP paths exist, two are selected as primary and
   secondary RPF interfaces.  Information from the IGP link-state
   topology could be leveraged to optimize this selection.

   Note, MoFRR does not restrict the number of paths on which joins are
   sent.  Implementations may use as many paths as are configured.

   A router X configured for non-ECMP-mode MoFRR for (S, G) sends a
   primary PIM join to its primary RPF R(X) and a secondary PIM Join to
   a neighbor N if the following three conditions are met.


   C1: xs < xn + ns
   C2: ns < nx + xs

Internet-Draft                    MoFRR                       March 2009


   C3: X cannot send a secondary join to N if N is the only member of the OIF list

   The first condition ensures that N is not on the primary branch from
   X to S.

   The second condition ensures that X is not on the primary branch from
   N to S.

   These two conditions ensure that at least locally the two paths are
   disjoint.

   The third condition is required to break control-plane loops which
   could occur in some scenarios.

   For example in FIG3, if PE1 and PE2 have received an igmp request for
   (S, G), they will both send a primary PIM join on their plane and a
   secondary PIM join to the neighbor PE.  If their receivers would
   leave at the same time, it could be possible for the (S, G) states on
   PE1 and PE2 to never get deleted as each PE refresh each other via
   the secondary PIM joins (remember that a secondary PIM join is not
   distinguishable from a primary PIM join.  MoFRR does not require any
   PIM protocol modification).

   A control-plane loop occurs when two nodes keep a state forever due
   to the secondary joins they send to each other.  This forever
   condition is not acceptable as no real receiver is connected to the
   nodes (directly via IGMP or indirectly via PIM).  Rule 3 prevents
   this case as it prevents the mutual refresh of secondary joins and it
   applies it in the specific case where there is no real receiver
   connected.

6.1.  Variation

   Rule R3 can be removed if Rule 2 is restricted as follows:

   R2p: ns < xs

   This ensures that X only sends a secondary join to a neighbor N who
   is strictly closer to the source than X is.  By reciprocity, N will
   thus never be able to send an sedondary join to the same source via
   X. The strictly smaller than is key here.

   Note that this non-ECMP-mode MoFRR variation does not support the
   square topology and hence is less preferred.

7.  Ring Topologies

   This will be documented in a future versions of the draft.


8.  Keep It Simple Principle

   Many Service Providers devise their topology such that PEs have
   disjoint paths to the multicast sources.  MoFRR leverages the
   existence of these disjoint paths without any PIM protocol
   modification.  Interoperability testing is thus not required.  In
   such topologies, MoFRR only needs to be deployed on the PE devices.
   Each PE device can be enabled one by one.  PEs not enabled for MoFRR
   do not see any change or degradation.

   Multicast streams with Tight SLA requirements are often characterized
   by a continuous high packet rate (SD video has a continuous
   interpacket gap of ~ 3msec).  MoFRR simply leverages the stream
   characteristic to detect any failures along the primary branch and
   switch-over on the secondary branch in a few 10s of msec.


9.  Other Applications

   While all the examples in this document show the MoFRR applicability
   on PE devices, it is clear that MoFRR could be enabled on aggregation
   or core routers.

   MoFRR can be popular in Data Center network configurations.  With the
   advent of lower cost ethernet and increasing port density in routers,
   there is more meshed connectivity than ever before.  When using a
   3-level access, distribution, and core layers in a Data Center, there
   is a lot of inexpensive bandwidth connecting the layers.  This will
   lend itself to more opportunities for ECMP paths at multiple layers.
   This allows for multiple layers of redundancy protecting link and
   node failure at each layer with minimal redundancy cost.

   Redundancy costs are reduced because only one packet is forwarded at
   every link along the primary and secondary data paths so there is no
   duplication of data on any link thereby providing make-before-break
   protection at a very small cost.

   The MoFRR behavior described for PIM are immediately applicable to
   MLDP.  Alternate methods to detect failures such as MPLS-OAM or BFD
   may be considered.

   The MoFRR principle may be applied to MVPNs.

10.  Security Considerations

   There are no security considerations for this design other than what
   is already in the main PIM specification [RFC4601].
