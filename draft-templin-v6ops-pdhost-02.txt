                    IPv6 Prefix Delegation for Hosts
                   draft-templin-v6ops-pdhost-02.txt

Abstract

   IPv6 prefixes are typically delegated to requesting routers which
   then use them to number their downstream-attached links and networks.
   The requesting router then acts as a router between the downstream-
   attached hosts and the upstream provider network, and can also act as
   a host under the weak end system model.  This document considers the
   case when the "requesting router" is actually a simple host, and
   receives a delegated prefix that it can use for multi-addressing
   purposes.  The host does not connect any downstream-attached
   networks, and uses the prefix solely for its own multi-addressing
   purposes.

1.  Introduction

   IPv6 provides a prefix delegation service using the Dynamic Host
   Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) [RFC3315].  Using DHCPv6
   Prefix Delegation (PD) [RFC3633], a requesting router asks for a
   prefix from a delegating router.  When the prefix is delegated, the
   requesting router sub-delegates the prefix to its downstream-attached
   links via one or more "LAN" interfaces.  The requesting router then
   acts as a router between hosts on the LAN interfaces and the upstream
   provider network (i.e., the "WAN" interface), and can also act as a
   host under the weak end system model [RFC1122].  This document
   considers the case when the "requesting router" is actually a simple
   host, and receives a prefix delegation as if it were a router.  The
   host need not have any LAN interfaces, and can use the prefix solely
   for its own multi-addressing purpose.

2.  Multi-Addressing

   IPv6 allows for assignment of multiple addresses to a single
   interface.  [I-D.ietf-v6ops-host-addr-availability] discusses options
   for multi-addressing as well as use cases where multi-addressing may
   be desirable.  Multi-addressing options include Stateless Address
   Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) [RFC4862] or stateful DHCPv6 address
   delegation [RFC3315], as well as assignment of multiple addresses
   from a delegated prefix.

Internet-Draft         Prefix Delegation for Hosts             June 2016


   SLAAC and DHCPv6 address delegation typically obtain addresses from
   an on-link prefix configured on the link over which the addresses are
   obtained.  When this happens, the address recipient is obliged to use
   Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) to join the appropriate solicited-
   node multicast group(s) and the Duplicate Address Detection (DAD)
   algorithm [RFC4862] to ensure that no other node on the link
   configures a duplicate address.  Alternatively, address delegation
   from a delegated prefix can be used by a node under either the weak
   or strong end system models [RFC1122].  In that case, the MLD/DAD
   procedure is not necessary, since the prefix has been delegated to
   the node for its own exclusive use and the prefix is not assigned to
   the link over which the prefix was obtained.

3.  Multi-Addressing Alternatives

   When a node receives a prefix delegation, it has many alternatives
   for the way in which it can provision the prefix.  [RFC7278]
   discusses alternatives for provisioning a prefix obtained by a User
   Equipment (UE) device under the 3rd Generation Partnership Program
   (3GPP) service model.  This document considers the more general case
   when the node receives a prefix delegation in which the prefix is
   delegated for the exclusive use of the prefix recipient.

   When the node receives the prefix (e.g., a /64), it can sub-delegate
   the prefix to its LAN interfaces and configure multiple addresses for
   itself on a LAN interface.  The node uses link-local-only addressing
   on the WAN interface, and configures a default route that points to a
   router on the WAN link.  The node can then act as both a host for its
   own applications and a router for any downstream-attached hosts.
   This approach is often known as the "tethered" configuration.

   When the node does not have any LAN interfaces, it may still wish to
   obtain a prefix solely for multi-addressing purposes.  In a first
   alternative, the node can receive the prefix acting as a requesting
   router over the WAN interface but then assign the prefix to an
   internal virtual interface (e.g., a loopback interface) and assign
   one or more addresses taken from the prefix to the virtual interface.
   In that case, applications on the node can use the assigned addresses
   according to the weak end system model.

   In a second alternative, the node can receive the prefix as a
   requesting router over the WAN interface but then assign the prefix
   to a loopback interface and assign one or more addresses taken from
   the prefix to the WAN interface.  In that case, applications on the
   node can use the assigned addresses according to the strong end
   system model.

   In both of these latter two cases, the node acts as a host internally
   even though it behaves as a router from the standpoint of prefix
   delegation and neighbor discovery over the WAN interface.  The host
   can configure as many addresses for itself as it wants.

4.  MLD/DAD Implications

   When a node configures addresses for itself using either SLAAC or
   DHCPv6 address delegation from a prefix that is on-link on the WAN
   interface, the node performs MLD/DAD by sending multicast messages to
   test whether another node that configures a duplicate address is on
   the link.  When there are many such addresses and/or many such nodes,
   this could result in substantial multicast traffic that affects all
   nodes on the link.

   When a node configures addresses for itself using a delegated prefix,
   the node can configure as many addresses as it wants but does not
   perform MLD/DAD for any of the addresses over the WAN interface.
   This means that arbitrarily many addresses can be assigned without
   having any multicast messaging over the WAN link that could disturb
   other nodes.  Note however that nodes that assign the addresses
   directly to the WAN interface must be capable of disabling MLD/DAD on
   the WAN interface, i.e., they must set DupAddrDetectTransmits to zero
   [RFC4862].

5.  IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Implications

   The node acts as a simple host to send Router Solicitation messages
   over the WAN interface the same as described in Section 4.2 of
   [RFC7084].

   In order to maintain the appearance of a router (i.e., even though it
   is acting as a simple host), the node sets the "Router" flag to TRUE
   in any Neighbor Advertisement messages it sends.  This ensures that
   the "isRouter" flag in the neighbor cache entries of any neighbors
   remains TRUE.

   The node initially has only a default route pointing to a router on
   the WAN link.  This means that packets sent over the node's WAN
   interface will initially go through a default router even if there is
   a better first-hop node on the link.  In that case,a Redirect message
   can update the node's neighbor cache, and future packets can take the
   more direct route without disturbing the default router.  The
   Redirect can apply either to a singleton destination address, or to
   an entire destination prefix as described in AERO
   [I-D.templin-aerolink].

8.  Acknowledgements

   This work was motivated by recent discussions on the v6ops list.
   Mark Smith pointed out the need to consider MLD as well as DAD for
   the assignment of addresses to interfaces.
