                       YANG model classification
          draft-bogdanovic-netmod-yang-model-classification-02

Abstract

   YANG became de facto standard language for data modeling in the
   industry.  More and more groups uses YANG to create protocol and
   service models, both for configuration and operational models.
   Currently there is a lack of consistent terminology to categorize
   those models.  A consistent terminology would help models
   categorization, assist in the analysis the YANG data modeling effort
   in the IETF and in the industry, and facilitate the YANG-related
   discussions between different groups.

1.  Introduction

   YANG [RFC6020] became de-facto standard language for data modeling in
   the industry.  Not only at the IETF, but also in multiple Standard
   Development Organizations, different consortia, ad hoc groups, and
   OSP.  Therefore, many YANG models are being developed and published.
   Today, there is no classification of models, there are no clear
   guidelines on how to layer models on each other, or how to classify
   existing or new models.  With this document, the authors propose a
   new way to classify the YANG model, along with a taxonomy.

   Acknowledging that the YANG became the de-facto standard language for
   data modeling, the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) has
   been encouraging the working groups to use the NETCONF [RFC6241] and
   YANG standards for configuration, especially in new charters
   [Writable-MIB-Module-IESG-Statement].

Internet-Draft          YANG model classification             March 2015


   YANG Models can be classified according to two dimensions: based on
   the layer in the hierarchy of models, and based on the model type.
   Those two categories are covered in the next two sections.

2.  First Dimension: Network YANG Data Model Layering

   When developing models, there are two approaches possible, top down
   and bottom up.  Top down approach is driven by business requirements
   and bottom up is driven by technological ones.

   There are no hard requirements on how to create models, but it would
   be useful to have a classification and how to create models that can
   be easily reused, as with this time and energy will be saved in
   future development.  We should stimulate both development styles,
   bottom up and top down, as each has its benefits and groups to which
   a certain style will be more appealing than the other.

   For layering purposes, we can classify data models into two layers:

   o  Network Service YANG Model: an abstract view, in YANG, of a
      service deployed on one or multiple network elements.

   o  Network Element YANG Model: describe the configuration parameters,
      in YANG, of a specific device technology or feature.

   Figure 1 displays example YANG models at different layers.  By
   layering the models, it is easier to achieve reusability of existing
   lower layer models in higher level models and preventing duplication
   of same features modeled in different layers.  When developing models
   per layers, it allows creating very focused groups in specific areas.
   As an example, creating protocol data definitions network equipment
   YANG data models should involve people that have intimate experience
   of implemention details.  On the other hand, network service models
   are best developed by people experienced in network operations.  Same
   network service, can be implemented and modeled using different
   Network Element YANG models.

2.1.  Network Service YANG Data Models

   Network Service YANG models are created by network operators to
   contain the characteristics of a service, as discussed with their
   customers.  That is, it does not provide details for configuring
   network elements or protocols.  A separate process is responsible for
   mapping this Network Service Model onto the Network Element YANG
   Models, depending on how the network operator chooses to realize the
   service.

   For example, http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-l3vpn-service-
   yang/ provides an abstracted view of the Layer 3 IP VPN service
   configuration components.  It will be up to an orchestrator to take
   this as an input and use specific configurations models on the
   network element layer to configure the different network elements to
   deliver the service.

   Network Service YANG models can be developed in multiple ways.
   Building them monolithic from vendor models or by combining one or
   more service components into an end to end service data model.  It
   specifies complete service that is provided by the network operator.

Internet-Draft          YANG model classification             March 2015


   Building monolithic network service model has an advantage of doing
   it fast, but at the expense of flexibility of updating the service
   later or changing equipment vendors.  Such an end to end service can
   be VPLS/VPWS, L2VPN, IPsec, etc.  If we take into example VPLS L2VPN
   service, it can be built as a single network service model or it can
   be built from several service components.  VPWS L2VPN service can be
   built on top of MPLS or IP network core.  When building such a
   network service model, network variations have to be taken into the
   account and by creating service components modle, such as MPLS, BGP
   service component models, it is easier to build a network service
   model, such as VPWS L2VPN.

2.2.  Network Element YANG Data models

   This is base model for all higher models.  It fully describes a
   protocol or technology, such as OSPF [I-D.ietf-ospf-yang], ISIS
   [I-D.ietf-isis-yang-isis-cfg] or feature, such as the access control
   list [I-D.ietf-netmod-acl-model].

3.  Second Dimension: Model Type

   At very high level, models can be divided into proprietary and
   standard.  Each vendor, consortium, open source project can publish
   their models and those are considered proprietary models.  When an
   SDO, such as IETF or IEEE, publishes an accepted model document, then
   this is a standard model.  There are use cases where a consortium has
   published work which de facto became standard, such as Linux kernel,
   but for the clarity in this document, authors are making a separation
   between models based on the above description.

      Standard YANG Model: YANG model defined by an Standard Development
      organization (SDO), e.g.  IETF, IEEE.

      Standard Extension YANG Model: YANG Model that describes a
      standard extension, example route filter, to standard filter YANG
      model.

      Proprietary Extension to Standard YANG Model: As the Standard YANG
      Models contains a subset of all the Vendor Configuration Models,
      proprietary extensions must complement the Standard YANG Models to
      represent a Vendor Configuration Model.

      Proprietary YANG Model: A non Standard YANG Model.

      Vendor Configuration Model: It describes all configurable
      capabilities of the device and what device vendor exposes for
      configuration.  The vendor configuration model can be CLI or YANG-
      based.

Internet-Draft          YANG model classification             March 2015


   As mentioned earlier in this document, there are two ways of
   designing models, top down and bottom up with one restriction.
   Everything is dependent on the vendor data model.  That model
   describes all the possibilities and if model developers prefers, they
   can use vendor model only to design service components, network
   service and business service.  Using vendor model provides all
   capabilities today, but it comes with restrictions of portability
   between vendors and to certain extent devices.  On the other hand,
   only standard models and standard extensions can be used, but this
   might result in less feature rich or less efficient services.
   Service model developer has a choice to reuse service components or
   write a model completely based on vendor data model.

3.1.  Standard YANG model

   With YANG we have a common language, that enables different
   communities to express data models that are widely understandable
   without lot of additional explanation.  This enables different
   groups, such as IETF, to standardize data models, defined as an IETF
   RFC, and vendors to support them, which will make it easier to for
   network operators to manage their network configuration
   programmatically.  The Standard YANG Models can distinguished between
   the core YANG models, such as the YANG Data Model for Interface
   Management [RFC7223], and the technology specific YANG models, such
   as the Configuration Data Model for the IP Flow Information Export
   (IPFIX) and Packet Sampling (PSAMP) Protocols [RFC6728].

3.2.  Standard Extension YANG Model

   Standard Extension is the conditional portion of a Standard YANG
   Model, expressed with the feature, if-feature, augment YANG
   statements [RFC6020].  An example of such standard extension is
   policy based routing (PBR).  PBR is found in many vendor
   implementations and have many common features, but not all vendors
   support PBR on all of their devices.

3.3.  Proprietary Extension to Standard YANG Model

   Proprietary extension is a conditional portion of a Standard YANG
   Model, expressed with feature, if-feature, augment YANG statements
   [RFC6020].  Proprietary extensions are required as the Standard YANG
   model will not cover all the possible configuration parameters of the
   different vendors.  Proprietary extension can be a feature depending
   on hardware platform capabilities and it is not available by other
   vendors.  Such an example could be match condition for packet
   classification used for PBR.

Internet-Draft          YANG model classification             March 2015


3.4.  Vendor configuration model

   Base model for all other models is the vendor configuration model.
   It describes all configurable capabilities of the device and what
   device vendor exposes for configuration.

   The standard configuration model is a subset of vendor configuration
   model.  The standard configuration model can be broken into base
   model and standard extension models, where the base is common data
   model and standard extensions are standard features that are not
   implemented by all vendors.  Example of standard base model is Access
   Control List and routing filter is a standard extension on ACL.  Or
   another example: encryption algorithm is standard feature, but the
   different types, like md5, hmac-md5, hmac-sha1, etc are standard
   extensions, as it is not that all vendors have all encryption
   algorithm types implemented.

   Although all vendors provide very similar functionality using
   standards, implementations are different.  One of basic examples are
   dynamic routing protocols.  We can see today two main types of
   routing protocol configuration.

      protocol centric - all the protocol related config is contained
      with the protocol itself.  Especially in case of multiple
      instances of the routing protocol running in different routing-
      instances (routing-instance as described in core routing model
      [I-D.ietf-netmod-routing-cfg]), all the routing-instance protocol
      config is contained in the default routing instance.

               Router ospf 10
               Default-metric 100
               Address-family ipv4 vrf VRF1
                   Network x.x.x.x area 0

               Address-family ipv4 vrf VRF2
                   Network x.x.x.x area 0

               Address-family ipv4
                   Network x.x.x.x area 1

      In term of YANG model, the routing protocol configuration will be
      defined within the default routing-instance and the routing-
      protocol config will contain multiple instances referring to other
      routing-instances.

      VRF centric - All the protocol related config for a routing-
      instance is contained within this routing-instance.

               Routing-instance VRF1 {
                 Protocols isis {

                 }
               }
               Routing-instance VRF2 {
                 Protocols isis {

                 }
               }

      In terms of YANG model, the routing protocol configuration for a
      routing-instance will be defined within the associated routing-
      instance.

      The bottom line message is that, even if YANG models are
      standardized, they will provide different CLI outcomes, simply
      because the CLI among vendors is not standardized.

3.5.  Proprietary YANG Model

   While waiting for the Standard YANG Models to be published, the
   different vendors might offer Proprietary YANG Models.

   The OSS/BSS may contains business related models.  Those models,
   which may or may not be written in YANG, are outside the scope of the
   IETF work

5.  IETF, Other SDOs, and open source

   IETF, as a standard defining organization (SDO), is well positioned
   to standardize Network Element YANG models.  With a wide range of
   expertise found within its working groups focused on those technology
   definitions.  As IETF participants implement those protocols, they
   have deep expertise about the implementation and finding a common
   base standard configuration model between vendors should be a very
   viable goal.

Internet-Draft          YANG model classification             March 2015


   In some situation where the protocols are standardized by different
   SDOs, those SDOs should be responsible for its YANG data modeling
   effort.  For example, the IETF has transferred the responsibility for
   some IEEE technology-related MIB modules to the IEEE 802.1 and 802.3
   Working Group [RFC4663], [RFC7448].  Similarly, the IEEE should be
   responsible for similar YANG data modeling efforts.

   Developing Network Service YANG Models requires network operations
   expertise.  When those operators participate in IETF work, the right
   working group can be formed, and those Service YANG Models can be
   developed within IETF.  However, some other groups, like Metro
   Ethernet Forum or CableLabs, could be better positioned for service
   modeling related to their area of expertise.

   Today there are many open source projects and some of them are
   becoming de facto standards, like the Linux kernel.  Many such open
   source projects, like Open Daylight, OpenStack, etc, are doing very
   good work and their work is being accepted and deployed in production
   environments.  They bring a lot of very valuable experience to other
   groups.  From IETF perspective, if there is such a work present, it
   can be used as a very good starting point for modeling within IETF.
