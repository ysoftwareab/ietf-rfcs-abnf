Internet-Draft                 XCAP CPCP                   February 2004


1. Introduction

   SIP conferencing framework [11] defines the mechanisms for
   multi-party centralized conferencing in a SIP environment. Existing
   SIP mechanisms allow users, for example, to join and leave a
   conference. A centralized server,called focus, can expel and invite
   users, and may have proprietary access control lists and user
   privilege definitions. However, in many cases it is useful to have
   standardized conference policy elements such as access control lists
   and the standardized protocol means to manipulate them as defined in
   conference policy control protocol requirements [7] document. This
   document provides both standardized conference policy elements and an
   XCAP [8] application usage to manipulate them.

   Other mechanisms, such as web page or voice response system can also
   be used to manipulate conference policy data.

   XCAP has many advantages in its use for conference policy control
   protocol. It is a HTTP 1.1 based protocol that allows clients to
   read, write, modify and delete application data stored in XML format
   at a server. XCAP maps XML document elements and attributes to HTTP
   URIs that can be directly accessed by HTTP. One application area
   which has already adopted XCAP is the manipulation of event lists
   [9].

2. Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

3. Terminology

   This document uses terminology from [11]. Some additional definitions
   are introduced here.

      ACL

         Access control list (ACL) defines users who can join to a
         conference. Users may have allowed, blocked, pending or
         expelled status in the list. Each conference has its own ACL.

      CPS

         Conference Policy Server. See [11]

      Conference participant

Internet-Draft                 XCAP CPCP                   February 2004


         Conference participant is a user who has on-going session (e.g.
         SIP dialog) with the conference focus.

      Floor control

         Floor control is a mechanism that enables applications or users
         to gain safe and mutually exclusive or non-exclusive access to
         the shared object or resource in a conference.

      Dial-Out List (DL)

         Dial-out list (DL) is a list of users who the focus needs to
         invite to the conference.

      PCL

         Privilege control control (PCL) defines privileges for a user.
         Each user in a conference may have different list of privileges
         and each conference has its own PCL.

      Privileged user

         In this document, a privileged user is the creator. Defining
         privileges to modify certain parts of a conference policy is
         outside the scope of this document.

      CPS XCAP URI

         The URI of the XCAP server that is used to create the
         conference. The URI contsruction is specified in [8]. It is
         refered to in XCAP as the host part.

      Conference Policy URI

         The URI of conference policy. In XCAP, it is the CPS XCAP URI
         along with the abs_path. It identifies the XML document. The
         URI contsruction is specified in [8].


4. Application Unique ID

   XCAP requires application usages to define a unique application usage
   ID (AUID) in either the IETF tree or a vendor tree. This
   specification defines the "conference-policy" AUID within the IETF
   tree, via the IANA registration in Section 22.

Internet-Draft                 XCAP CPCP                   February 2004


5. Resource Interdependencies

   The conference policy server must fill the conference URI(s), if a
   conference URI was not proposed by the client. The client then needs
   to perform a HTTP GET to retrieve the modified policy containing the
   assigned conference URI(s). The CPS MAY assign multiple conference
   URIs to a conference, one for each call signaling protocol that it
   supports. Section 15 and Section 18.1 discuss this is more detail.

6. Additional Constraints

   These are defined within the XML structure definition.

7. Naming Conventions

   There are no naming conventions that need to be defined for this
   application usage.

8. Authorization Policies

   This application usage does not modify the default XCAP authorization
   policy, which is that only a user can read, write or modify their own
   documents. A server can allow privileged users to modify documents
   that they don't own, but the establishment and indication of such
   policies is outside the scope of this document. It is anticipated
   that a future application usage will define which users are allowed
   to modify a list resource.

9. MIME Type for CPCP XML Document

   The MIME type for the CPCP XML document is application/
   conference-policy+xml

10. Overview of Operation

   This document assumes that the user knows the location of conference
   policy server (the XCAP URI), the details of that discovery are
   beyond the scope of this document.

   CPCP is implemented as an XCAP application usage  [8].

   CPCP allows clients to manipulate the conference policy at conference
   policy server (CPS). CPS is able to inform the focus about changes in
   conference policy, if necessary. 	For example, if new users are added
   to the dial-out list, then conference policy server informs the focus
   which makes the invitations as requested.

   Some assumptions about the conferencing architecture are made.



Koskelainen & Khartabil    Expires August 4, 2004               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                 XCAP CPCP                   February 2004


   Clients always connect to the conference policy server (CPS) when
   they perform XCAP operations. It is assumed that CPS informs other
   conferencing entities, such as focus, floor control server and mixer
   directly or via focus. For example, if user A wants to expel user B
   from an ongoing conference, user A must first manipulate the
   conference policy data. CPS then communicates that change to the
   focus to perform the operation.

11. Communication Between Conference Entities

   The communication between different (logical) conferencing elements
   is beyond the scope of this document. It can be expected that in most
   cases CPS includes also those logical functions. If the focus is not
   co-located with CPS, one way for the CPS to communicate changes to
   the conference policy is for the focus to subscribe to the XCAP event
   package [10].

12. Conference Creation and Termination

   Conference is identified by one or more conference URIs. Conference
   URI assignment is discussed in Section 15 and Section 18.1.

   A user may create a new conference at the CPS by using HTTP PUT and
   sending it to the CPS XCAP URI. Depending on server policy and user
   privileges, the CPS may accept the creation.

   A conference can be deleted permanently using HTTP DELETE, which
   consequently frees the resources. When the user deletes a conference,
   CPS MUST also delete all its sub-conferences ("side bars") at a
   server. Conference side bars are separate (independent) URIs at the
   server.

   A running conference instance can be also stopped by modifying the
   conference time information. This leaves conference ACLs and
   privileges intact but stops the conference.

   If a conference is in progress when deleted or stopped, the focus
   issues signalling requests to terminate all conference related
   sessions it has with clients. In SIP, the focus issues BYE requests.

13. Manipulating the Participant Lists

   A user with sufficient privileges is allowed to perform user
   management operations, such as adding a new user to the conference or
   expelling a user from the conference. These operations are performed
   by modifying the conference policy at the conference policy server.
   After authorising the user to do such manipulations, the conference
   policy server communicates the change to the focus. The focus reacts



Koskelainen & Khartabil    Expires August 4, 2004               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                 XCAP CPCP                   February 2004


   by performing operations such as sending SIP INVITE, BYE or REFER.

   Asking the focus to invite a user into the conference is achieved by
   sending a HTTP PUT request to the CPS that modifies the Dial-Out List
   (DL) adding URIs to it. The CPS then triggers the focus to send the
   conference invitation, eg: SIP INVITE(s) as needed. Similarly, a user
   can be removed from the Dial-out list by issuing a HTTP DELETE
   removing the URIs.

   Asking the focus to allow certain users to join the conference is
   done by sending a HTTP PUT request to the CPS that modifies the ACL
   by adding URIs with access type of "Allowed". The CPS then informs
   the focus of such change to the ACL.

   If the conference is long-lasting, it is possible that new rules are
   added all the time but old rules are almost never removed (some of
   them are overwritten, though). This leads easily to the situation
   that the ACL contains many unnecessary rules which are not really
   needed anymore. Therefore, there is a need  to delete ACL rule. This
   can be achieved with the HTTP DELETE.

   Conflicting rules MUST NOT exist (e.g. both allowed and blocked
   action is defined for same target). It is the responsibly of the CPS
   to ensure such restriction. If a conflict occurs, the CPS can ...

13.1 Expelling a Participant

   Expel operation uses the HTTP PUT request as well, as the user is put
   on the ACL list with an access type of "Expelled". This also triggers
   the CPS to inform the focus about the need to issue a terminating
   request, such as a SIP BYE.

   A participant cannot be expelled by placing him in the ACL list with
   an action to block. This is because the focus interprets a user
   placed on the block list as a user who is not allowed to dial into
   the conference, but does not prohibit the focus from inviting that
   user to join, if that user is on the Dial-out list. Having the user
   on an Expel list explicitly informs the focus not to invite that
   user, even if s/he is on the Dial-out list.

14. Privileges: Who can modify the conference policy

   There is a need for different privileges to exist where users can
   modify certain parts of the conference policy XML document. This
   specification does not specify such privileges and relies on other
   XCAP usage documents to define those privileges. If no such XCAP
   usage document exists, the base XCAP document defines the default
   privileges so that only the creator of the document is the sole user



Koskelainen & Khartabil    Expires August 4, 2004               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                 XCAP CPCP                   February 2004


   with write access.

   This specification, however, makes ready the CPCP XML document to
   allow an external usage document to define which parts of such an XML
   document a user can modify (which parts of an XML document a user has
   read/write access to) by dividing the CPCP XML document into
   sections, each with a separate namespace. It is envisioned that the
   XCAP usage document for read/write access of another XCAP XML
   document uses namespaces as the key to allow/disallow users from
   reading and/or modifying that XCAP usage document.

15. Conference URI(s)

   A conference is identified by one or more conference URIs. Conference
   URIs can be proposed by the creator of the conference policy,  as it
   may be useful to have human-friendly name in some cases, or can be
   assigned by the CPS. If the creator has proposed a conference URI,
   the server needs to decide whether it accept the name proposed by the
   client or not. It does this determination by examining if the
   conference URI already exists or not. If it exists, the server ...

   A Conference URI can be SIP, SIPS, TEL, or any supported URI scheme.
   There must be at least one URI for a conference. The CPS MAY assign
   multiple conference URIs to a conference, one for each call signaling
   protocol that it supports. If the creator of the conference policy
   proposed a conference URI for a protocol that the server does not
   support, the server ...

16. Floor Control Policy vs. Floor Control Protocol

   Conference floor control is an optional feature provided by a
   separate floor control protocol (FCP). However, creating a floor and
   defining a floor policy belongs to CPCP. Moreover, setting some key
   floor parameters, such as floor moderator in moderator controlled
   floor policy, belongs to CPCP. FCP only defines how to request,
   grant, deny and revoke a floor within given floor policy.

   For example, in a typical conference the privileged conference user
   (creator) uses CPCP for creating a floor for audio plane, defining
   the floor policy as "moderator-controlled" and appointing one user -
   possibly himself -  to act as a floor moderator governing the access
   to the floor.

   When the floor has been created and possible floor moderator has been
   assigned, the floor moderator gets notifications from the focus and
   is able to accept or deny floor requests from the conference users.
   Note that FCP does not create media streams (just the virtual floor
   attached to media), as media streams are created using CPCP. The

   details of FCP are beyond the scope of this draft.

17. Structure of a Conference Policy document

   Conference policy document is an XML [5] document that MUST be
   well-formed and MUST be valid. Conference policy documents MUST be
   based on XML 1.0 and MUST be encoded using UTF-8. This specification
   makes use of XML namespaces for identifying conference policy
   documents and document fragments. The namespace URI for elements
   defined by this specification is a URN [2], using the namespace
   identifier 'ietf' defined by [3] and extended by [13]. This URN is:

   urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:conference-policy

   A conference policy document begins with the root element tag
   "conference-policy". Other elements from different namespaces MAY be
   present for the purposes of extensibility. Elements or attributes
   from unknown namespaces MUST be ignored. The conference policy is
   build up using multiple namespaces:

   o  "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:conference-settings": This namespace
      defines elements for conference setting. The inclusion of this
      namespace is optional. It contains the mandatory element
      <Conference-settings>. This element contains the conference URI(s)
      and maximum number of participants. It can occur only once in the
      document.

   o  "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:conference-info": This namespace defines
      elements to carry conference information. The inclusion of this
      namespace is optional. It contains the mandatory element
      <Conference-info>. This element includes informational describing
      the conference, e.g. for search purposes. This information can
      also be used in the session description when the focus is sending
      invitations. It can occur only once in the document.

   o  "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:conference-time": This optional namespace
      defines conference time information. It defines the mandatory
      <Conference-time> element that includes elements defining start
      and stop times for a conference.

   o  "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:conference-acl": This optional namespace
      is for the access control list. It defines the mandatory <ACL>
      element that contains URIs for users who can dial into the
      conference, users who are blocked from dialling in, and expelled
      users.

   o  "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:conference-pcl": This optional namespace
      is for the privilege control list. It defines the mandatory <PCL>



Koskelainen & Khartabil    Expires August 4, 2004               [Page 9]

Internet-Draft                 XCAP CPCP                   February 2004


      element that contains privileges and URIs for users who have those
      privileges.

   o  "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:conference-dl": This optional namespace is
      for the dial-out list. It defines the mandatory <DL> element that
      contains URIs for users that the focus will invite to the
      conference.

   o  "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:conference-sc": This optional namespace is
      for security control. It defines the <SC> element that contains
      conference security level and passwords.

   o  "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:conference-mp": This optional namespace is
      for the media policy for a conference. It defines the
      <Conference-media-policy> element that contains the media types to
      be used in the conference.

   o  "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:conference-fp": This optional namespace is
      for the floor control policy. It defines the
      <Conference-floor-policy> element.

   The elements are described in more detail in the forthcoming
   sections.

18. XML Document Description

18.1 <Conference-settings> element

   <Conference-URI> is an optional element. It can occur more than to
   accommodate to multiple signaling protocols. Once a conference URI is
   set, it MUST NOT be changed or removed for the duration of the
   conference. Only one URI per protocol MUST be set. URIs can be added
   at any time.

   This is in its own XML namespace, so it is separated from other
   elements and hence relevant modification rights (privileges) can be
   given more easily to other namespaces.

   <Max-participant-count> is an optional. It carries the maximum number
   of participants allowed in the conference. When the maximum number of
   participants threshold is reached, no new users are not allowed to
   join until the number of participants decreases again. If using SIP,
   the server can reject a request to join (INVITE) with a "480
   Temporarily Unavailable" response. Alternatively, the sever may
   implement a waiting queue.

18.2 <Conference-info> element

   Mandatory <Conference-info> element has its own namespace and it can
   occur only once in a document. It includes informative conference
   parameters which may be helpful describing the purpose of a
   conference, e.g. for search purposes or for providing host contact
   information. The <Conference-info element MUST have a special
   attribute 'xml:lang' to specify the language used in the contents of
   this element as defined Section 2.12 of [5].

   Each conference has an optional <Subject> element, which describes
   the current topic in a conference. The optional <Display-name>
   element is the display name of the conference, which usually does not
   change over time.

   <Free-text> and <Keywords> are optional elements. They provide
   additional textual information about the conference. This information
   can be made available to potential conference participants by means
   outside the scope of this document. Examples of usage could be
   searching for a conference based on some keywords. The optional
   <Web-page> element points to a URI where additional information about
   the conference can be found.

   The optional <Host-info> element contains several elements. It gives
   additional information about the user hosting the conference. This
   information can, for example, be included into the SDP fields of the
   SIP INVITEs sent by the focus. The <URI> element is optional and can
   occur more than once.

18.3 <Conference-time> element

   The information related to conference time and lifetime is contained
   in the <Conference-time> element. The conference may occur for a
   limited period of time (i.e. bounded), or the conference may be
   unbounded (i.e. it does not have a specified end time). Bounded
   conferences may occur multiple times(e.g. on weekly basis).

   <Conference-Time> has its own XML namespace. It contains one or more
   <Conference-occurrence> elements each defining the time information
   of a single conference occurrence. Multiple <Conference-occurrence>
   elements MAY be used if a conference is active at multiple
   irregularly spaced times; each additional <Conference-occurrence>
   element contains time information for a specific occurrence.

   For each occurrence, the <Start-time> element specifies when a
   conference starts. the <Stop-time> element specifies the time a
   conference stops. If the <Start-time> element is not present, it
   indicates that the conference starts immediately. If the <Stop-time>



Koskelainen & Khartabil    Expires August 4, 2004              [Page 11]

Internet-Draft                 XCAP CPCP                   February 2004


   is set to zero, then conference occurrence is not bounded, i.e.
   permanent, though it will not become active until the <Start-time>.
   If the <Stop-time> element is not present, it indicates that the
   conference terminates as soon as the last participant leaves the
   conference. The focus might wait a small period of time before
   terminating the conference, in case a participant joins straight
   after the last participant leaves.

   When saying that a conference starts, or becomes active (start-time),
   it means that the mixing starts.  A focus will most likely allow
   participants to connect shortly before start time, but may put them
   on hold until the start time. Participants on the Dial out list may
   also be dialled to shortly before start time.

   A conference terminates with stop-time. The creator is free to set
   the stop-time to be the time s/he leaves (and therefore the
   conference terminates when s/he leaves), terminate the conference as
   s/he leaves (modifying stop-time), or leave before the stop-time and
   therefore the conference continues. The stop-time can be changed by
   the conference creator, during the conference, to allow the extension
   of the conference based on best effort. A conference always
   terminates when the conference policy is removed, regardless of the
   stop time.

   The absence of this conference time information indicates that a
   conference starts immediately and terminates when the conference
   policy is removed. See Section 12 for more details

18.4 <ACL> (Access Control List) element

   ACL has its own XML namespace.

   The purpose of Access Control List (ACL) is to control who can join
   the conference.A conference has one <ACL> consisting of one or more
   <ACL-target-URI> elements and the <Access-type> parameter for those
   URIs. Access-Types are one of Allowed/Blocked/Pending/Expelled.
   Allowed means that the target is allowed to join the conference.
   Blocked means that the target is not allowed to join the conference.
   This can be used in the where the allowed URIs are wild-carded and
   the user wants to explicitly block one potential participant, whose
   URI falls within the wildcarded URIs, from joining. The other way
   around is also possible where the blocked URIs are wildcarded and
   the user wants to explicitly allow one potential participant, whose
   URI falls within the wildcarded URIs,to join. Pending means that
   authorisation for the target is not granted and while further
   processing is required - such as consulting the moderator. Expelled
   means that user is expelled from current conference and is not
   allowed to join or be dialled-out (even if dial-out list includes

Internet-Draft                 XCAP CPCP                   February 2004


   user's URI).

   Wildcards are allowed in ACL as follows. The domain part is allowed
   to be wildcard only if the username is a wildcard. Wildcard in the
   domain part MUST be immediately after the @-sign. A wildcard in the
   domain is interpreted as multiple zones. For example:
   sip:*@*.example.com includes sip:*@engineering.example.com as well as
   sip:*@tester.engineering.example.com. The use of wildcarding has been
   restricted to avoid ambiguous entries in the access control list.

   Examples of allowed wildcards are -  sip:*@example.com, *@*.com, *@*.

   Examples are not allowed wildcards are -  sip:bob@example.*,
   sip:bob@*.com, sip:*@example.*.com.

   "Most-specific expression wins" policy is used if overlapping rules
   are found. Basically, this means that user specific rule is searched
   first and if it is not found, then most specific wildcard rule is
   utilized.

   There is a need for the ACL to contain an entry that defines the
   default access types for users not explicitly allowed nor blocked
   from joining the conference, i.e. everybody else. For example:
   "Pending" action for *@*. If that entry is missing, the focus local
   policy dictates the behaviour.

   Sip: and sips: schemes are treated as equivalent in the ACL since it
   defines users and not the security used by users.

   It is also possible to ask the focus to refer users to the
   conference. An optional Boolean attribute "refer" exists in the
   <ACL-target-URI> that indicates to the server that the creator of the
   conference wishes for the focus to refer the identified potential
   participants to the conference when a conference occurrence has
   started.  In SIP, this is achieved by the focus sending a REFER
   request to those potential participants. The default value for the
   "refer" attribute is "false".

18.5 <PCL> (Privilege Control List) element

   Advanced privilege models can be applied in conferencing context
   (e.g. who is allowed to modify ACL, who is allowed to expel users
   etc). This document defines only one privilege and leaves the
   definition of additional privileges (e.g. who can modify ACL) as a
   separate standardisation effort.

   The <PCL> element is mandatory and has its own XML namespace. It
   defines which users has what privileges. The <PCL> element may

Internet-Draft                 XCAP CPCP                   February 2004


   contain one or more <PCL-target> elements. The <PCL-target> element
   carries 2 pieces of information: the target URI, <PCL-target-URI> and
   the privileges for that URI, <Privileges>. All mandatory elements.
   The target URI can be wildcarded as described for the ACL in Section
   18.4.

   Example URIs are:

      sip:bob@company.com

      sip:*@example.com

   The only privilege defined in this document is
   RIGHT_TO_SUBSCRIBE_TO_CONF_EVENT_PACKAGE. It defines which users are
   allowed to 	subscribe to the conference state event package [12]and
   be notified.

18.6 <DL> (Dial-Out List) element

   The dial-out list (DL)  is a list of user URIs that the focus uses to
   learn who to invite to join a conference. This list can be updated
   during the conference lifetime so it can be used for mid-conference
   invites (and mass-invites) as well.

   DL has its own XML namespace.

   The <DL> element includes a mandatory <DL-target> element. The
   <DL-target> element includes the mandatory <DL-target-URI> element.
   This elements carries the URI of the user to be invited.

18.7 <SC> (Security Control) element

   The conference security encompasses three aspects: controlling the
   visibility of a conference, securing the SIP messages, and performing
   authentication for individual users.

   This element has its own XML namespace.

   The conference security settings start with the mandatory >SC>
   element. It contains the mandatory <Visibility> element. This element
   can hold one of two values: visible or invisible. The <Visibility>
   element controls whether information in the <Conference-URI>,
   <Conference-time> and <Conference-info> elements may be made
   available publicly. For example, an application at a conference
   server might list the ongoing conferences on web page, or it may
   allow searching for conferences based on the keywords listed in the
   <Conference-info> element. Setting <Visibility> to "invisible"
   instructs the application not to reveal any such information.



Koskelainen & Khartabil    Expires August 4, 2004              [Page 14]

Internet-Draft                 XCAP CPCP                   February 2004


   However, information in other elements, such as <ACL>, should not be
   seen by anyone else other than a privileged user, even with the
   <Visibility> element set to "visible".

   We define two mechanisms for securing the signaling between users and
   the focus: TLS and S/MIME. TLS is used to provide transport layer
   security on a hop-by-hop basis. According to SIP [6], using SIPS URI
   scheme in a request signifies that TLS must be used to secure each
   hop over which the request is forwarded until the request reaches the
   SIP entity responsible for the domain portion of the Request-URI.

   The <Security-mechanism>element inside the <SC> element has 2 boolean
   parameter: TLS and S/MIME. When in TLS parameter is set to "true"
   (thus implying the use of SIPS URI scheme, if SIP is used as the
   signaling protocol), it is required that TLS is used end-to-end. In
   other words, TLS must be used also on the last hop between the entity
   responsible for the domain portion of the Request-URI and the
   conference policy server.

   If end-to-end confidentiality of entire SIP messages is not required
   by the conference policy, but it is required that the message bodies
   within SIP are encrypted, the S/MIME attribute must have a value
   "true".

   TLS and S/MIME may be required independent of each other. In other
   words, it may be required to use neither, one, or both depending on
   the settings of these parameters.

   The conference creator can define an authentication policy for the
   participants. This is done with the optional <SC-target> element.

   If the <SC-target> element is present, then at least one
   <SC-target-URI> inside the <SC-target> element must be present, each
   identifies a user or a set of users for which the authentication
   mechanism apply. The target URI can be wildcarded as described for
   the ACL in Section 18.4.

   The authentication policy defined in the optional
   <Authorization-mechanism> element defines how the participants should
   be authenticated. Two authentication mechanisms are defined in this
   document: Digest and Digest-AKA. The authentication policy can also
   be set to none. The password associated with each user in the Digest
   authentication is included in the optional <Password> attribute. This
   attribute is ignored if authentication is set to "none".

18.8 <Conference-floor-policy> element

   This element has its own XML namespace. The absence of this namespace



Koskelainen & Khartabil    Expires August 4, 2004              [Page 15]

Internet-Draft                 XCAP CPCP                   February 2004


   and its elements from an XML document indicates that the conference
   does not have a floor.

   The <Conference-floor-policy> is mandatory and contains the required
   boolean attribute that indicates if the floor is moderator controlled
   or not. One or more <Floor> elements can appear in the
   <Conference-floor-policy> element. The number of those elements
   indicates how many floors the conference can have. A floor can be
   used for one or more media types; the mandatory <Media-types> element
   can contain zero or more of the <Video>, <Audio>, <Application>,
   <Data> ,<Control>, <Message>, and <text> elements indicating the
   media of the floor. One type of media can only appear once. Other
   media types can be defined by extensions.

   A floor can be controlled using many algorithms; the mandatory
   <Algorithm> element MUST contain one and only of the
   <Moderator-controlled>, <FCFS>, and <Random> elements indicating the
   algorithm.

   The <Max-floor-users> element in the <Floor> element is optional and,
   if present, dictates the maximum number of users who can have the
   floor at one time. The optional <Moderator-URI> indicates the URI of
   the moderator. It MUST be set if the attribute moderator-controlled
   is set to "true".

18.9 <Conference-media-Policy> element

   Media policy is an integral part of the conference policy. It defines
   e.g. what kind of media topologies exist in the conference. This
   document defines a very basic media policy that states the media
   types a conference has. This is used by the focus to know what media
   types to invite users with and what media types it should accept from
   dialling in users. The details of media manipulation are defined
   elsewhere. User with sufficient privileges is allowed to create,
   modify and delete the media policy (e.g. add new media types).

   This element has its own XML namespace.

   The definition starts with the mandatory <Conference-media-policy>
   element. This element contains a mandatory <Media-types> element that
   lists the media types allowed for this conference. The format of this
   mirrors that of the same element in floor policy.

20. Examples

   The following is an example of a document compliant to the schema:

   Below is an example how to create a conference:


   1. Creating a Conference

   Alice creates a conference as follows:

      PUT http://xcap.example.com/services/conferences/users/Alice/conference.xml HTTP/1.1
      Content-Type:application/conference-policy+xml

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="US-ASCII"?>
   <Conference xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:conference-policy"
   	                xmlns:conference-mp="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:conference-mp"
   	                xmlns:conference-fp="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:conference-fp"
   	                xmlns:conference-sc="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:conference-sc"

   	                xmlns:conference-acl="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:conference-acl"
   	                xmlns:conference-time="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:conference-time"
   	                xmlns:conference-info="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:conference-info"
   	                xmlns:conference-settings="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:conference-settings">

   			<Media-types>
   				<Audio/>
   			</Media-types>
   	</conference-mp:Conference-media-policy>
   </Conference>

   At exactly 2003-06-16T10:00:00Z, the conference server creates a focus and
   sends SIP INVITE requests to Alice and Sarah. After the focus is created,
   SIP INVITE requests can be accepted from anyone at domain example.com.
   Any attempts to join the conference by users in other domains are rejected.

   2. Expelling a User

   Continuing with the above example: aftar the conference has started,
   Alice decides to expel Bob who has joined the conference. So she adds him to
   the ACL list with Access-type of value "Blocked".

   The XCAP request looks like:

      PUT http://xcap.example.com/services/conferences/users/Alice/conference.xml?
         Conference/ACL/ACL-target-URI HTTP/1.1
         Content-Type:text/plain

      <ACL-target-URI Access-type="Explelled">sip:bob@example.com</ACL-target-URI>

   At this point, the focus sends a SIP BYE request to Bob ending Bob's participation
   in the conference. This also guarantees that Bob cannot rejoin the conference since
   he is expilictly expelled until his URI is removed from the ACL Expelled list.
   Any attempt Bob makes in rejoining the conference will fail.


   3. Allowing An Expelled Participant To Join Again

   Continuing with the example above, Alice now decides to allow Bob to join
   again after a period of time. She does so by removing his entry in the
   ACL that identifies him as "Expelled".

      DELETE http://xcap.example.com/services/conferences/users/Alice/conference.xml?
         Conference/ACL/ACL-target-URI/ACL-target-URI="sip:bob@example.com" HTTP/1.1

   Bob can now rejoin the conference by sending a SIP INVITE request.

   4. Removing A Conference

   Alice now decides she no longer wants this conference to exist and therefore
   deletes the conference:

      DELETE http://xcap.example.com/services/conferences/users/Alice/conference.xml

   As a result of this action, the focus sends SIP BYE requests to all current
   participants in the conference. The conference server terminates the focus thereafter.




21. Security Considerations

   See section Section 18.7.

22. IANA Considerations
