Abstract

   This document describes how to create subscriptions to ad-hoc
   resource lists in SIP. This is done by having the SUBSCRIBE request
   that requests the creation of the subscription carry a URI list.

1. Introduction

   Subscriptions to homogeneous resource lists in SIP [2] are described
   in [3], which assumes that a resource list (i.e., a list of URIs) is
   represented by a URI (generally a SIP URI). Once a UA obtains the URI
   that represents a resource list, it can use the mechanisms described
   in [3] to subscribe to it.

   For example, let us assume that the resource list identified by the
   SIP URI sip:my-friends@example.com contains the following URIs:


   sip:bill@example.com
   sip:joe@example.com
   sip:ted@example.com
   sip:bob@example.com

   If a UA subscribes to the presece information of
   sip:my-friends@example.com, it will obtain the presence information
   of all the resources in the list.

   In any case, [3] does not tackle list creation. This document
   describes a way to create an ad-hoc list with a set of resources, and
   subscribe to it, using a single SIP request. We use the mechanism to
   carry URI lists in SIP messages described in [4].

2. Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
   RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as
   described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [1] and indicate requirement levels for
   compliant implementations.

3. Providing a Resource List Server with a URI List

   A client that wants to create an ad-hoc resource list and subscribe
   to it using the mechanism described in this document MUST add a
   "list" parameter (defined in [4]) to the URI of the resource list and
   MUST place the resulting URI in the Request-URI of a SUBSCRIBE. The
   "list" parameter MUST contain a pointer to a URI list that contains
   the URIs that belong to the resource list. The following is an
   example of a Request-URI with a "list" parameter.


   sip:rls@example.com;list="cid:cn35t8jf02@example.com"

   The client MUST build the remaining of the SUBSCRIBE request

   following the rules in [3].

4. URI List Format

   As described in [4], the default format for URI lists in SIP is the
   XCAP resource list format [6]. Still, specific services need to
   describe which information clients should include in their URI lists,
   as described in [4].

   UAs subscribing to an ad-hoc resource list SHOULD use flat lists
   (i.e., no hierarchical lists), SHOULD NOT use any entry's attributes
   but "uri", and SHOULD NOT include any elements inside entries but
   "display-name" elements.

   Resource list servers receiving a URI list with more information than
   what we have just described SHOULD discard all the extra information.

5. Resource List Server Behavior

   On reception of a SUBSCRIBE with a URI list as described in Section
   3, a resource list server MUST follow the rules described in  [3] to
   create the subscription, using the URI list just received as the
   resource list for the subscription.

   Once the resource list server has created the subscription, it
   behaves as a regular resource list server and MUST follow the rules
   in [3].

   Note that the status code in the response to the SUBSCRIBE does not
   provide any information about whether or not the resource list server
   was able to succesfully subscribe to the URIs in the URI list. The
   client obtains this information in the NOTIFIES sent by the server.

6. Resource List Life-Time

   The life-time of a resource list created as described in Section 5 is
   blundled to the life-time of the subscription. That is, the resource
   list SHOULD be destroyed when the subscription expires or is
   otherwise terminated.

7. Providing a URI to Manipulate a Resource List

   A client may need to manipulate a resource list at a resource list
   server. The resource list server MAY provide a URI to manipulate the
   resource list associated with a subscription using the Call-Info
   header field [5] in the NOTIFY that establishes the subscription. The
   "purpose" parameter of the Call-Info header field MUST have a value
   of "list-management". The following is an example of such a header

   field.


   Call-Info: <http://xcap.example.com/your-list.xml>
              ;purpose=list-management


8. Example

   The following is an example of a SUBSCRIBE request, which carries a
   URI list in its body, sent by a UA to a resource list server.


   SUBSCRIBE  sip:rls@example.com;list=cid:cn35t8jf02@example.com SIP/2.0
   Via: SIP/2.0/TCP terminal.example.com;branch=z9hG4bKwYb6QREiCL
   Max-Forwards: 70
   To: RLS <sip:rls@example.com>
   From: <sip:adam@example.com>;tag=ie4hbb8t
   Call-ID: cdB34qLToC@terminal.example.com
   CSeq: 1 SUBSCRIBE
