1.  Introduction

   Matroska aims to become THE standard of multimedia container formats.
   It was derived from a project called MCF (http://mukoli.free.fr/mcf/
   mcf.html), but differentiates from it significantly because it is
   based on EBML (https://github.com/Matroska-Org/ebml-
   specification/blob/master/specification.markdown) (Extensible Binary
   Meta Language), a binary derivative of XML.  EBML enables significant
   advantages in terms of future format extensibility, without breaking
   file support in old parsers.

   First, it is essential to clarify exactly "What an Audio/Video
   container is", to avoid any misunderstandings:

   *  It is NOT a video or audio compression format (codec)

   *  It is an envelope for which there can be many audio, video and
      subtitles streams, allowing the user to store a complete movie or
      CD in a single file.

Internet-Draft               Matroska Format                  April 2020


   Matroska is designed with the future in mind.  It incorporates
   features like:

   *  Fast seeking in the file

   *  Chapter entries

   *  Full metadata (tags) support

   *  Selectable subtitle/audio/video streams

   *  Modularly expandable

   *  Error resilience (can recover playback even when the stream is
      damaged)

   *  Streamable over the internet and local networks (HTTP, CIFS, FTP,
      etc)

   *  Menus (like DVDs have)

   Matroska is an open standards project.  This means for personal use
   it is absolutely free to use and that the technical specifications
   describing the bitstream are open to everybody, even to companies
   that would like to support it in their products.

2.  Status of this document

   This document is a work-in-progress specification defining the
   Matroska file format as part of the IETF Cellar working group
   (https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/cellar/charter/).  But since it's
   quite complete it is used as a reference for the development of
   libmatroska.  Legacy versions of the specification can be found here
   (https://matroska.org/files/matroska.pdf) (PDF doc by Alexander
   No&#233; -- outdated).

   For a simplified diagram of the layout of a Matroska file, see the
   Diagram page (diagram.md).

   A more refined and detailed version of the EBML specifications is
   being worked on here (https://github.com/Matroska-Org/ebml-
   specification/blob/master/specification.markdown).

   The table found below is now generated from the "source" of the
   Matroska specification.  This XML file (https://github.com/Matroska-
   Org/foundation-source/blob/master/spectool/specdata.xml) is also used
   to generate the semantic data used in libmatroska and libmatroska2.
   We encourage anyone to use and monitor its changes so your code is
   spec-proof and always up to date.

   Note that versions 1, 2 and 3 have been finalized.  Version 4 is
   currently work in progress.  There MAY be further additions to v4.

3.  Security Considerations

   Matroska inherits security considerations from EBML.

   Attacks on a "Matroska Reader" could include:

   *  Storage of a arbitrary and potentially executable data within an
      "Attachment Element".  "Matroska Readers" that extract or use data
      from Matroska Attachments SHOULD check that the data adheres to
      expectations.

   *  A "Matroska Attachment" with an inaccurate mime-type.

4.  IANA Considerations

   To be determined.

5.  Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document defines specific terms in order to define the format
   and application of "Matroska".  Specific terms are defined below:

   "Matroska": a multimedia container format based on EBML (Extensible
   Binary Meta Language)

   "Matroska Reader": A "Matroska Reader" is a data parser that
   interprets the semantics of a Matroska document and creates a way for
   programs to use "Matroska".

   "Matroska Player": A "Matroska Player" is a "Matroska Reader" with a
   primary purpose of playing audiovisual files, including "Matroska"
   documents.

6.  Basis in EBML

   Matroska is a Document Type of EBML (Extensible Binary Meta
   Language).  This specification is dependent on the EBML Specification
   (https://github.com/Matroska-Org/ebml-specification/blob/master/
   specification.markdown).  For an understanding of Matroska's EBML
   Schema, see in particular the sections of the EBML Specification
   covering EBML Element Types (https://github.com/Matroska-Org/ebml-
   specification/blob/master/specification.markdown#ebml-element-types),
   EBML Schema (https://github.com/Matroska-Org/ebml-
   specification/blob/master/specification.markdown#ebml-schema), and
   EBML Structure (https://github.com/Matroska-Org/ebml-
   specification/blob/master/specification.markdown#structure).

6.1.  Added Constraints on EBML

   As an EBML Document Type, Matroska adds the following constraints to
   the EBML specification.

   *  The "docType" of the "EBML Header" MUST be 'matroska'.

   *  The "EBMLMaxIDLength" of the "EBML Header" MUST be "4".

   *  The "EBMLMaxSizeLength" of the "EBML Header" MUST be between "1"
      and "8" inclusive.

6.2.  Matroska Design

   All top-levels elements (Segment and direct sub-elements) are coded
   on 4 octets, i.e. class D elements.

6.2.1.  Language Codes

   Matroska from version 1 through 3 uses language codes that can be
   either the 3 letters bibliographic ISO-639-2
   (https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/English_list.php) form
   (like "fre" for french), or such a language code followed by a dash
   and a country code for specialities in languages (like "fre-ca" for
   Canadian French).  The "ISO 639-2 Language Elements" are "Language
   Element", "TagLanguage Element", and "ChapLanguage Element".

   Starting in Matroska version 4, either "ISO 639-2" or BCP 47
   (https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47) MAY be used, although "BCP 47" is
   RECOMMENDED.  The "BCP 47 Language Elements" are "LanguageIETF
   Element", "TagLanguageIETF Element", and "ChapLanguageIETF Element".
   If a "BCP 47 Language Element" and an "ISO 639-2 Language Element"
   are used within the same "Parent Element", then the "ISO 639-2
   Language Element" MUST be ignored and precedence given to the "BCP 47
   Language Element".

   Country codes are the same as used for internet domains
   (https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db).

6.2.2.  Physical Types

   Each level can have different meanings for audio and video.  The
   ORIGINAL_MEDIUM tag can be used to specify a string for
   ChapterPhysicalEquiv = 60.  Here is the list of possible levels for
   both audio and video :

   Bit 0 is the most significant bit.

   Frames using references SHOULD be stored in "coding order".  That
   means the references first and then the frames referencing them.  A
   consequence is that timestamps might not be consecutive.  But a frame
   with a past timestamp MUST reference a frame already known, otherwise
   it's considered bad/void.

6.2.4.  Lacing

   Lacing is a mechanism to save space when storing data.  It is
   typically used for small blocks of data (referred to as frames in
   Matroska).  There are 3 types of lacing:

   1.  Xiph, inspired by what is found in the Ogg container

   2.  EBML, which is the same with sizes coded differently

   3.  fixed-size, where the size is not coded

   For example, a user wants to store 3 frames of the same track.  The
   first frame is 800 octets long, the second is 500 octets long and the
   third is 1000 octets long.  As these data are small, they can be
   stored in a lace to save space.  They will then be stored in the same
   block as follows:

6.2.4.1.  Xiph lacing

   *  Block head (with lacing bits set to 01)

   *  Lacing head: Number of frames in the lace -1, i.e. 2 (the 800 and
      500 octets one)

   *  Lacing sizes: only the 2 first ones will be coded, 800 gives
      255;255;255;35, 500 gives 255;245.  The size of the last frame is
      deduced from the total size of the Block.

   *  Data in frame 1

   *  Data in frame 2

   *  Data in frame 3

   A frame with a size multiple of 255 is coded with a 0 at the end of
   the size, for example 765 is coded 255;255;255;0.

6.2.4.2.  EBML lacing

   In this case, the size is not coded as blocks of 255 bytes, but as a
   difference with the previous size and this size is coded as in EBML.
   The first size in the lace is unsigned as in EBML.  The others use a
   range shifting to get a sign on each value:

6.2.4.3.  Fixed-size lacing

   In this case, only the number of frames in the lace is saved, the
   size of each frame is deduced from the total size of the Block.  For
   example, for 3 frames of 800 octets each:

   *  Block head (with lacing bits set to 10)

   *  Lacing head: Number of frames in the lace -1, i.e. 2

   *  Data in frame 1

   *  Data in frame 2

   *  Data in frame 3

6.2.4.4.  SimpleBlock Structure

   The "SimpleBlock" is inspired by the Block structure (#block-
   structure).  The main differences are the added Keyframe flag and
   Discardable flag.  Otherwise everything is the same.

   Bit 0 is the most significant bit.

   Frames using references SHOULD be stored in "coding order".  That
   means the references first and then the frames referencing them.  A
   consequence is that timestamps might not be consecutive.  But a frame

7.  Matroska Structure

   A Matroska file MUST be composed of at least one "EBML Document"
   using the "Matroska Document Type".  Each "EBML Document" MUST start
   with an "EBML Header" and MUST be followed by the "EBML Root
   Element", defined as "Segment" in Matroska.  Matroska defines several
   "Top Level Elements" which MAY occur within the "Segment".

   As an example, a simple Matroska file consisting of a single "EBML
   Document" could be represented like this:

   *  "EBML Header"

   *  "Segment"

   A more complex Matroska file consisting of an "EBML Stream"
   (consisting of two "EBML Documents") could be represented like this:

   *  "EBML Header"

   *  "Segment"

   *  "EBML Header"

   *  "Segment"

   The following diagram represents a simple Matroska file, comprised of
   an "EBML Document" with an "EBML Header", a "Segment Element" (the
   "Root Element"), and all eight Matroska "Top Level Elements".  In the
   following diagrams of this section, horizontal spacing expresses a
   parent-child relationship between Matroska Elements (e.g. the "Info
   Element" is contained within the "Segment Element") whereas vertical
   alignment represents the storage order within the file.

   The Matroska "EBML Schema" defines eight "Top Level Elements":
   "SeekHead", "Info", "Tracks", "Chapters", "Cluster", "Cues",
   "Attachments", and "Tags".

   The "SeekHead Element" (also known as "MetaSeek") contains an index
   of "Top Level Elements" locations within the "Segment".  Use of the
   "SeekHead Element" is RECOMMENDED.  Without a "SeekHead Element", a
   Matroska parser would have to search the entire file to find all of
   the other "Top Level Elements".  This is due to Matroska's flexible
   ordering requirements; for instance, it is acceptable for the
   "Chapters Element" to be stored after the "Cluster Elements".

   +--------------------------------+
   | SeekHead | Seek | SeekID       |

   |          |      | SeekPosition |
   +--------------------------------+

             Figure 1: Representation of a "SeekHead Element".

   The "Info Element" contains vital information for identifying the
   whole "Segment".  This includes the title for the "Segment", a
   randomly generated unique identifier, and the unique identifier(s) of
   any linked "Segment Elements".

                                 Elements".

   The "Tracks Element" defines the technical details for each track and
   can store the name, number, unique identifier, language and type
   (audio, video, subtitles, etc.) of each track.  For example, the
   "Tracks Element" MAY store information about the resolution of a
   video track or sample rate of an audio track.

   The "Tracks Element" MUST identify all the data needed by the codec
   to decode the data of the specified track.  However, the data
   required is contingent on the codec used for the track.  For example,
   a "Track Element" for uncompressed audio only requires the audio bit
   rate to be present.  A codec such as AC-3 would require that the
   "CodecID Element" be present for all tracks, as it is the primary way
   to identify which codec to use to decode the track.

   "Cluster Elements" contain the content for each track, e.g. video
   frames.  A Matroska file SHOULD contain at least one "Cluster
   Element".  The "Cluster Element" helps to break up "SimpleBlock" or
   "BlockGroup Elements" and helps with seeking and error protection.
   It is RECOMMENDED that the size of each individual "Cluster Element"
   be limited to store no more than 5 seconds or 5 megabytes.  Every
   "Cluster Element" MUST contain a "Timestamp Element".  This SHOULD be
   the "Timestamp Element" used to play the first "Block" in the
   "Cluster Element".  There SHOULD be one or more "BlockGroup" or
   "SimpleBlock Element" in each "Cluster Element".  A "BlockGroup
   Element" MAY contain a "Block" of data and any information relating
   directly to that "Block".

         Figure 6: Representation of the "Block Element" structure.

   Each "Cluster" MUST contain exactly one "Timestamp Element".  The
   "Timestamp Element" value MUST be stored once per "Cluster".  The
   "Timestamp Element" in the "Cluster" is relative to the entire
   "Segment".  The "Timestamp Element" SHOULD be the first "Element" in
   the "Cluster".

   Additionally, the "Block" contains an offset that, when added to the
   "Cluster"'s "Timestamp Element" value, yields the "Block"'s effective
   timestamp.  Therefore, timestamp in the "Block" itself is relative to

   the "Timestamp Element" in the "Cluster".  For example, if the
   "Timestamp Element" in the "Cluster" is set to 10 seconds and a
   "Block" in that "Cluster" is supposed to be played 12 seconds into
   the clip, the timestamp in the "Block" would be set to 2 seconds.

   The "ReferenceBlock" in the "BlockGroup" is used instead of the basic
   "P-frame"/"B-frame" description.  Instead of simply saying that this
   "Block" depends on the "Block" directly before, or directly
   afterwards, the "Timestamp" of the necessary "Block" is used.
   Because there can be as many "ReferenceBlock Elements" as necessary
   for a "Block", it allows for some extremely complex referencing.

   The "Cues Element" is used to seek when playing back a file by
   providing a temporal index for some of the "Tracks".  It is similar
   to the "SeekHead Element", but used for seeking to a specific time
   when playing back the file.  It is possible to seek without this
   element, but it is much more difficult because a "Matroska Reader"
   would have to 'hunt and peck' through the file looking for the
   correct timestamp.

   The "Cues Element" SHOULD contain at least one "CuePoint Element".
   Each "CuePoint Element" stores the position of the "Cluster" that
   contains the "BlockGroup" or "SimpleBlock Element".  The timestamp is
   stored in the "CueTime Element" and location is stored in the
   "CueTrackPositions Element".

   The "Cues Element" is flexible.  For instance, "Cues Element" can be
   used to index every single timestamp of every "Block" or they can be
   indexed selectively.  For video files, it is RECOMMENDED to index at
   least the keyframes of the video track.

   | Cues | CuePoint | CueTime           |

   The "Attachments Element" is for attaching files to a Matroska file
   such as pictures, webpages, programs, or even the codec needed to
   play back the file.

            Figure 8: Representation of a "Attachments Element".

   The "Tags Element" contains metadata that describes the "Segment" and
   potentially its "Tracks", "Chapters", and "Attachments".  Each
   "Track" or "Chapter" that those tags applies to has its UID listed in
   the "Tags".  The "Tags" contain all extra information about the file:
   scriptwriter, singer, actors, directors, titles, edition, price,
   dates, genre, comments, etc.  Tags can contain their values in
   multiple languages.  For example, a movie's "title" "Tag" might
   contain both the original English title as well as the title it was
   released as in Germany.

11.  Matroska Element Ordering

   Except for the "EBML Header" and the "CRC-32 Element", the EBML
   specification does not require any particular storage order for
   "Elements".  The Matroska specification however defines mandates and
   recommendations for ordering certain "Elements" in order to
   facilitate better playback, seeking, and editing efficiency.  This
   section describes and offers rationale for ordering requirements and
   recommendations for Matroska.

11.1.  Top-Level Elements

   The "Info Element" is the only REQUIRED "Top-Level Element" in a
   Matroska file.  To be playable, Matroska MUST also contain at least
   one "Tracks Element" and "Cluster Element".  The first "Info Element"
   and the first "Tracks Element" MUST either be stored before the first
   "Cluster Element" or both SHALL be referenced by a "SeekHead Element"
   occurring before the first "Cluster Element".

   It is possible to edit a Matroska file after it has been created.
   For example, chapters, tags or attachments can be added.  When new
   "Top-Level Elements" are added to a Matroska file, the "SeekHead"
   Element(s) MUST be updated so that the "SeekHead" Element(s) itemize
   the identity and position of all "Top-Level Elements".  Editing,
   removing, or adding "Elements" to a Matroska file often requires that
   some existing "Elements" be voided or extended; therefore, it is
   RECOMMENDED to use "Void Elements" as padding in between "Top-Level
   Elements".

11.2.  CRC-32

   As noted by the EBML specification, if a "CRC-32 Element" is used
   then the "CRC-32 Element" MUST be the first ordered "Element" within
   its "Parent Element".  The Matroska specification recommends that
   "CRC-32 Elements" SHOULD NOT be used as an immediate "Child Element"
   of the "Segment Element"; however all "Top-Level Elements" of an
   "EBML Document" SHOULD include a "CRC-32 Element" as a "Child
   Element".

Internet-Draft               Matroska Format                  April 2020


11.3.  SeekHead

   If used, the first "SeekHead Element" SHOULD be the first non-"CRC-32
   Child Element" of the "Segment Element".  If a second "SeekHead
   Element" is used, then the first "SeekHead Element" MUST reference
   the identity and position of the second "SeekHead".  Additionally,
   the second "SeekHead Element" MUST only reference "Cluster" Elements
   and not any other "Top-Level Element" already contained within the
   first "SeekHead Element".  The second "SeekHead Element" MAY be
   stored in any order relative to the other "Top-Level Elements."
   Whether one or two "SeekHead Element(s)" are used, the "SeekHead
   Element(s)" MUST collectively reference the identity and position of
   all "Top-Level Elements" except for the first "SeekHead Element".

   It is RECOMMENDED that the first "SeekHead Element" be followed by a
   "Void Element" to allow for the "SeekHead Element" to be expanded to
   cover new "Top-Level Elements" that could be added to the Matroska
   file, such as "Tags", "Chapters" and "Attachments Elements".

11.4.  Cues (index)

   The "Cues Element" is RECOMMENDED to optimize seeking access in
   Matroska.  It is programmatically simpler to add the "Cues Element"
   after all "Cluster Elements" have been written because this does not
   require a prediction of how much space to reserve before writing the
   "Cluster Elements".  However, storing the "Cues Element" before the
   "Cluster Elements" can provide some seeking advantages.  If the "Cues
   Element" is present, then it SHOULD either be stored before the first
   "Cluster Element" or be referenced by a "SeekHead Element".

11.5.  Info

   The first "Info Element" SHOULD occur before the first "Tracks
   Element" and first "Cluster Element" except when referenced by a
   "SeekHead Element".

11.6.  Chapters Element

   The "Chapters Element" SHOULD be placed before the "Cluster
   Element(s)".  The "Chapters Element" can be used during playback even
   if the user does not need to seek.  It immediately gives the user
   information about what section is being read and what other sections
   are available.  In the case of Ordered Chapters it RECOMMENDED to
   evaluate the logical linking even before playing.  The "Chapters
   Element" SHOULD be placed before the first "Tracks Element" and after
   the first "Info Element".

11.7.  Attachments

   The "Attachments Element" is not intended to be used by default when
   playing the file, but could contain information relevant to the
   content, such as cover art or fonts.  Cover art is useful even before
   the file is played and fonts could be needed before playback starts
   for initialization of subtitles.  The "Attachments Element" MAY be
   placed before the first "Cluster Element"; however if the
   "Attachments Element" is likely to be edited, then it SHOULD be
   placed after the last "Cluster Element".

11.8.  Tags

   The "Tags Element" is most subject to changes after the file was
   originally created.  For easier editing, the "Tags Element" SHOULD be
   placed at the end of the "Segment Element", even after the
   "Attachments Element".  On the other hand, it is inconvenient to have
   to seek in the "Segment" for tags, especially for network streams.
   So it's better if the "Tags Element" is found early in the stream.
   When editing the "Tags Element", the original "Tags Element" at the
   beginning can be overwritten with a "Void Element" and a new "Tags
   Element" written at the end of the "Segment Element".  The file size
   will only marginally change.

11.12.  Cluster Timestamp

   The "Timestamp Element" MUST occur as in storage order before any
   "SimpleBlock", "BlockGroup", or "EncryptedBlock" within the "Cluster
   Element".

12.  Chapters

12.1.  Edition and Chapter Flags

12.1.1.  Chapter Flags

   Two "Chapter Flags" are defined to describe the behavior of the
   "ChapterAtom Element": "ChapterFlagHidden" and "ChapterFlagEnabled".

Internet-Draft               Matroska Format                  April 2020


   If a "ChapterAtom Element" is the "Child Element" of another
   "ChapterAtom Element" with a "Chapter Flag" set to "true", then the
   "Child ChapterAtom Element" MUST be interpreted as having its same
   "Chapter Flag" set to "true".  If a "ChapterAtom Element" is the
   "Child Element" of another "ChapterAtom Element" with a "Chapter
   Flag" set to "false" or if the "ChapterAtom Element" does not have a
   "ChapterAtom Element" as its "Parent Element", then it MUST be
   interpreted according to its own "Chapter Flag".

   As an example, consider a "Parent ChapterAtom Element" that has its
   "ChapterFlagHidden" set to "true" and also contains two child
   "ChapterAtoms", the first with "ChapterFlagHidden" set to "true" and
   the second with "ChapterFlagHidden" either set to "false" or not
   present at all (in which case the default value of the Element
   applies, which is "false").  Since the parent "ChapterAtom" has its
   "ChapterFlagHidden" set to "true" then all of its children
   "ChapterAtoms" MUST also be interpreted as if their
   "ChapterFlagHidden" is also set to "true".  However, if a "Control
   Track" toggles the parent's "ChapterFlagHidden" flag to "false", then
   only the parent "ChapterAtom" and its second child "ChapterAtom" MUST
   be interpreted as if "ChapterFlagHidden" is set to "false".  The
   first child "ChapterAtom" which has the "ChapterFlagHidden" flag set
   to "true" retains its value until its value is toggled to "false" by
   a "Control Track".

12.1.2.  Edition Flags

   Three "Edition Flags" are defined to describe the behavior of the
   "EditionEntry Element": "EditionFlagHidden", "EditionFlagDefault" and
   "EditionFlagOrdered".

12.1.2.1.  EditionFlagHidden

   The "EditionFlagHidden Flag" behaves similarly to the
   "ChapterFlagHidden Flag": if "EditionFlagHidden" is set to "true",
   its "Child ChapterAtoms Elements" MUST also be interpreted as if
   their "ChapterFlagHidden" is also set to "true", regardless of their
   own "ChapterFlagHidden Flags".  If "EditionFlagHidden" is toggled by
   a "Control Track" to "false", the "ChapterFlagHidden Flags" of the
   "Child ChapterAtoms Elements" SHALL determine whether the
   "ChapterAtom" is hidden or not.

12.1.2.2.  EditionFlagDefault

   It is RECOMMENDED that no more than one "Edition" have an
   "EditionFlagDefault Flag" set to "true".  The first "Edition" with
   both the "EditionFlagDefault Flag" set to "true" and the
   "EditionFlagHidden Flag" set to "false" is the Default Edition.  When
   all "EditionFlagDefault Flags" are set to "false", then the first
   "Edition" with the "EditionFlagHidden Flag" set to "false" is the
   Default Edition.  The Default Edition is the edition that should be
   used for playback by default.

12.1.2.3.  EditionFlagOrdered

   The "EditionFlagOrdered Flag" is a significant feature as it enables
   an "Edition" of "Ordered Chapters" which defines and arranges a
   virtual timeline rather than simply labeling points within the
   timeline.  For example, with "Editions" of "Ordered Chapters" a
   single "Matroska file" can present multiple edits of a film without
   duplicating content.  Alternatively if a videotape is digitized in
   full, one "Ordered Edition" could present the full content (including
   colorbars, countdown, slate, a feature presentation, and black
   frames), while another "Edition" of "Ordered Chapters" can use
   "Chapters" that only mark the intended presentation with the
   colorbars and other ancillary visual information excluded.  If an
   "Edition" of "Ordered Chapters" is enabled then the "Matroska Player"
   MUST play those Chapters in their stored order from the timestamp
   marked in the "ChapterTimeStart Element" to the timestamp marked in
   to "ChapterTimeEnd Element".

   If the "EditionFlagOrdered Flag" is set to "false", "Simple Chapters"
   are used and only the "ChapterTimeStart" of a "Chapter" is used as
   chapter mark to jump to the predefined point in the timeline.  With
   "Simple Chapters", a "Matroska Player" MUST ignore certain "Chapter
   Elements".  All these elements are now informational only.

   The following list shows the different usage of "Chapter Elements"
   between an ordered and non-ordered "Edition".

12.1.2.3.1.  Ordered-Edition and Matroska Segment-Linking

   *  Hard Linking: "Ordered-Chapters" supersedes the "Hard Linking".

   *  Soft Linking: In this complex system "Ordered Chapters" are
      REQUIRED and a "Chapter CODEC" MUST interpret the "ChapProcess" of
      all chapters.

   *  Medium Linking: "Ordered Chapters" are used in a normal way and
      can be combined with the "ChapterSegmentUID" element which
      establishes a link to another Matroska file/Segment.

   See the section on the Linked Segments (#linked-segments)) for more
   information about "Hard Linking", "Soft Linking" and "Medium
   Linking".

12.2.  Menu features

   The menu features are handled like a _chapter codec_. That means each
   codec has a type, some private data and some data in the chapters.

   The type of the menu system is defined by the "ChapProcessCodecID"
   parameter.  For now only 2 values are supported : 0 matroska script,
   1 menu borrowed from the DVD.  The private data depend on the type of
   menu system (stored in ChapProcessPrivate), idem for the data in the
   chapters (stored in ChapProcessData).

12.2.1.  Matroska Script (0)

   This is the case when "ChapProcessCodecID" = 0.  This is a script
   language build for Matroska purposes.  The inspiration comes from
   ActionScript, javascript and other similar scripting languages.  The
   commands are stored as text commands, in UTF-8.  The syntax is C
   like, with commands spanned on many lines, each terminating with a
   ";".  You can also include comments at the end of lines with "//" or
   comment many lines using "/* */".  The scripts are stored in
   ChapProcessData.  For the moment ChapProcessPrivate is not used.

   The one and only command existing for the moment is "GotoAndPlay(
   ChapterUID );".  As the same suggests, it means that when this
   command is encountered, the "Matroska Player" SHOULD jump to the
   "Chapter" specified by the UID and play it.

12.2.2.  DVD menu (1)

   This is the case when "ChapProcessCodecID" = 1.  Each level of a
   chapter corresponds to a logical level in the DVD system that is
   stored in the first octet of the ChapProcessPrivate.  This DVD
   hierarchy is as follows:

   You can also recover wether a Segment is a Video Manager (VMG), Video
   Title Set (VTS) or Video Title Set Menu (VTSM) from the
   ChapterTranslateID element found in the Segment Info.  This field
   uses 2 octets as follows:

   1.  Domain Type: 0 for VMG, the domain number for VTS and VTSM

   2.  Domain Value: 0 for VMG and VTSM, 1 for the VTS source.

   For instance, the menu part from VTS_01_0.VOB would be coded [1,0]
   and the content part from VTS_02_3.VOB would be [2,1].  The VMG is
   always [0,0]

   The following octets of ChapProcessPrivate are as follows:

   If the level specified in ChapProcessPrivate is a PGC (0x20), there
   is an octet called the Playback Type, specifying the kind of PGC
   defined:

   *  0x00: entry only/basic PGC

   *  0x82: Title+Entry Menu (only found in the Video Manager domain)

Internet-Draft               Matroska Format                  April 2020


   *  0x83: Root Menu (only found in the VTSM domain)

   *  0x84: Subpicture Menu (only found in the VTSM domain)

   *  0x85: Audio Menu (only found in the VTSM domain)

   *  0x86: Angle Menu (only found in the VTSM domain)

   *  0x87: Chapter Menu (only found in the VTSM domain)

   The next 4 following octets correspond to the User Operation flags
   (http://dvd.sourceforge.net/dvdinfo/uops.html) in the standard PGC.
   When a bit is set, the command SHOULD be disabled.

   ChapProcessData contains the pre/post/cell commands in binary format
   as there are stored on a DVD.  There is just an octet preceding these
   data to specify the number of commands in the element.  As follows:
   [# of commands(1)][command 1 (8)][command 2 (8)][command 3 (8)].

   More information on the DVD commands and format on DVD-replica
   (http://www.dvd-replica.com/DVD/), where we got most of the info
   about it.  You can also get information on DVD from the DVDinfo
   project (http://dvd.sourceforge.net/dvdinfo/).

12.3.  Example 1 : basic chaptering

   In this example a movie is split in different chapters.  It could
   also just be an audio file (album) on which each track corresponds to
   a chapter.

   *  00000ms - 05000ms : Intro

   *  05000ms - 25000ms : Before the crime

   *  25000ms - 27500ms : The crime

   *  27500ms - 38000ms : The killer arrested

   *  38000ms - 43000ms : Credits

   This would translate in the following matroska form :

   <Chapters>
     <EditionEntry>
       <EditionUID>16603393396715046047</EditionUID>

13.  Attachments

   Matroska supports storage of related files and data in the
   "Attachments Element" (a "Top-Level Element").  "Attachment Elements"
   can be used to store related cover art, font files, transcripts,
   reports, error recovery files, picture or text-based annotations,
   copies of specifications, or other ancillary files related to the
   "Segment".

   "Matroska Readers" MUST NOT execute files stored as "Attachment
   Elements".

13.1.  Cover Art

   This section defines a set of guidelines for the storage of cover art
   in Matroska files.  A "Matroska Reader" MAY use embedded cover art to
   display a representational still-image depiction of the multimedia
   contents of the Matroska file.

   Only JPEG and PNG image formats SHOULD be used for cover art
   pictures.

   There can be two different covers for a movie/album: a portrait style
   (e.g., a DVD case) and a landscape style (e.g., a wide banner ad).

   There can be two versions of the same cover, the "normal cover" and
   the "small cover".  The dimension of the "normal cover" SHOULD be 600
   pixels on the smallest side (for example, 960x600 for landscape,
   600x800 for portrait, or 600x600 for square).  The dimension of the
   "small cover" SHOULD be 120 pixels on the smallest side (for example,
   192x120 or 120x160).

   Versions of cover art can be differentiated by the filename, which is
   stored in the "FileName Element".  The default filename of the
   "normal cover" in square or portrait mode is "cover.(jpg|png)".  When
   stored, the "normal cover" SHOULD be the first Attachment in storage
   order.  The "small cover" SHOULD be prefixed with "small_", such as
   "small_cover.(jpg|png)".  The landscape variant SHOULD be suffixed
   with "_land", such as "cover_land.(jpg|png)".  The filenames are case
   sensitive.

   The following table provides examples of file names for cover art in
   Attachments.

      +----------------------+-------------------+-----------------+
      | FileName             | Image Orientation | Pixel Length of |
      |                      |                   | Smallest Side   |
      +======================+===================+=================+
      | cover.jpg            | Portrait or       | 600             |

14.  Cues

   The "Cues Element" provides an index of certain "Cluster Elements" to
   allow for optimized seeking to absolute timestamps within the
   "Segment".  The "Cues Element" contains one or many "CuePoint
   Elements" which each MUST reference an absolute timestamp (via the
   "CueTime Element"), a "Track" (via the "CueTrack Element"), and a
   "Segment Position" (via the "CueClusterPosition Element").
   Additional non-mandated Elements are part of the "CuePoint Element"

   such as "CueDuration", "CueRelativePosition", "CueCodecState" and
   others which provide any "Matroska Reader" with additional
   information to use in the optimization of seeking performance.

14.1.  Recommendations

   The following recommendations are provided to optimize Matroska
   performance.

   *  Unless Matroska is used as a live stream, it SHOULD contain a
      "Cues Element".

   *  For each video track, each keyframe SHOULD be referenced by a
      "CuePoint Element".

   *  It is RECOMMENDED to not reference non-keyframes of video tracks
      in "Cues" unless it references a "Cluster Element" which contains
      a "CodecState Element" but no keyframes.

   *  For each subtitle track present, each subtitle frame SHOULD be
      referenced by a "CuePoint Element" with a "CueDuration Element".

   *  References to audio tracks MAY be skipped in "CuePoint Elements"
      if a video track is present.  When included the "CuePoint
      Elements" SHOULD reference audio keyframes at most once every 500
      milliseconds.

   *  If the referenced frame is not stored within the first
      "SimpleBlock" or first "BlockGroup" within its "Cluster Element",
      then the "CueRelativePosition Element" SHOULD be written to
      reference where in the "Cluster" the reference frame is stored.

   *  If a "CuePoint Element" references "Cluster Element" that includes
      a "CodecState Element", then that "CuePoint Element" MUST use a
      "CueCodecState Element".

   *  "CuePoint Elements" SHOULD be numerically sorted in storage order
      by the value of the "CueTime Element".

15.  Matroska Streaming

   In Matroska, there are two kinds of streaming: file access and
   livestreaming.

Internet-Draft               Matroska Format                  April 2020


15.1.  File Access

   File access can simply be reading a file located on your computer,
   but also includes accessing a file from an HTTP (web) server or CIFS
   (Windows share) server.  These protocols are usually safe from
   reading errors and seeking in the stream is possible.  However, when
   a file is stored far away or on a slow server, seeking can be an
   expensive operation and SHOULD be avoided.  The following guidelines,
   when followed, help reduce the number of seeking operations for
   regular playback and also have the playback start quickly without a
   lot of data needed to read first (like a "Cues Element", "Attachment
   Element" or "SeekHead Element").

   Matroska, having a small overhead, is well suited for storing music/
   videos on file servers without a big impact on the bandwidth used.
   Matroska does not require the index to be loaded before playing,
   which allows playback to start very quickly.  The index can be loaded
   only when seeking is requested the first time.

15.2.  Livestreaming

   Livestreaming is the equivalent of television broadcasting on the
   internet.  There are 2 families of servers for livestreaming: RTP/
   RTSP and HTTP.  Matroska is not meant to be used over RTP.  RTP
   already has timing and channel mechanisms that would be wasted if
   doubled in Matroska.  Additionally, having the same information at
   the RTP and Matroska level would be a source of confusion if they do
   not match.  Livestreaming of Matroska over HTTP (or any other plain
   protocol based on TCP) is possible.

   A live Matroska stream is different from a file because it usually
   has no known end (only ending when the client disconnects).  For
   this, all bits of the "size" portion of the "Segment Element" MUST be
   set to 1.  Another option is to concatenate "Segment Elements" with
   known sizes, one after the other.  This solution allows a change of
   codec/resolution between each segment.  For example, this allows for
   a switch between 4:3 and 16:9 in a television program.

   When "Segment Elements" are continuous, certain "Elements", like
   "MetaSeek", "Cues", "Chapters", and "Attachments", MUST NOT be used.

   It is possible for a "Matroska Player" to detect that a stream is not
   seekable.  If the stream has neither a "MetaSeek" list or a "Cues"
   list at the beginning of the stream, it SHOULD be considered non-
   seekable.  Even though it is possible to seek blindly forward in the
   stream, it is NOT RECOMMENDED.

Internet-Draft               Matroska Format                  April 2020


   In the context of live radio or web TV, it is possible to "tag" the
   content while it is playing.  The "Tags Element" can be placed
   between "Clusters" each time it is necessary.  In that case, the new
   "Tags Element" MUST reset the previously encountered "Tags Elements"
   and use the new values instead.

16.  Menu Specifications

   This document is a _draft of the Menu system_ that will be the
   default one in "Matroska".  As it will just be composed of a Control
   Track, it will be seen as a "codec" and could be replaced later by
   something else if needed.

   A menu is like what you see on DVDs, when you have some screens to
   select the audio format, subtitles or scene selection.

16.1.  Requirements

   What we'll try to have is a system that can do almost everything done
   on a DVD, or more, or better, or drop the unused features if
   necessary.

   As the name suggests, a Control Track is a track that can control the
   playback of the file and/or all the playback features.  To make it as
   simple as possible for "Matroska Players", the Control Track will
   just give orders to the "Matroska Player" and get the actions
   associated with the highlights/hotspots.

16.1.1.  Highlights/Hotspots

   A highlight is basically a rectangle/key associated with an action
   UID.  When that rectangle/key is activated, the "Matroska Player"
   send the UID of the action to the Control Track handler (codec).  The
   fact that it can also be a key means that even for audio only files,
   a keyboard shortcut or button panel could be used for menus.  But in
   that case, the hotspot will have to be associated with a name to
   display.

   This highlight is sent from the Control Track to the "Matroska
   Player".  Then the "Matroska Player" has to handle that highlight
   until it's deactivated (see Playback Features (#playback-features)).

   The highlight contains a UID of the action, a displayable name (UTF-
   8), an associated key (list of keys to be defined, probably
   up/down/left/right/select), a screen position/range and an image to
   display.  The image will be displayed either when the user place the
   mouse over the rectangle (or any other shape), or when an option of
   the screen is selected (not activated).  There could be a second

Internet-Draft               Matroska Format                  April 2020


   image used when the option is activated.  And there could be a third
   image that can serve as background.  This way you could have a still
   image (like in some DVDs) for the menu and behind that image blank
   video (small bitrate).

   When a highlight is activated by the user, the "Matroska Player" has
   to send the UID of the action to the Control Track.  Then the Control
   Track codec will handle the action and possibly give new orders to
   the "Matroska Player".

   The format used for storing images SHOULD be extensible.  For the
   moment we'll use PNG and BMP, both with alpha channel.

16.1.2.  Playback features

   All the following features will be sent from the Control Track to the
   "Matroska Player" :

   *  Jump to chapter (UID, prev, next, number)

   *  Disable all tracks of a kind (audio, video, subtitle)

   *  Enable track UID (the kind doesn't matter)

   *  Define/Disable a highlight

   *  Enable/Disable jumping

   *  Enable/Disable track selection of a kind

   *  Select Edition ID (see chapters)

   *  Pause playback

   *  Stop playback

   *  Enable/Disable a Chapter UID

   *  Hide/Unhide a Chapter UID

   All the actions will be written in a normal Matroska track, with a
   timestamp.  A "Menu Frame" SHOULD be able to contain more that one
   action/highlight for a given timestamp. (to be determined, EBML
   format structure)

Internet-Draft               Matroska Format                  April 2020


16.1.3.  Player requirements

   Some "Matroska Players" might not support the control track.  That
   mean they will play the active/looped parts as part of the data.  So
   I suggest putting the active/looped parts of a movie at the end of a
   movie.  When a Menu-aware "Matroska Player" encounter the default
   Control Track of a "Matroska" file, the first order SHOULD be to jump
   at the start of the active/looped part of the movie.

16.2.  Working Graph

   Matroska Source file -> Control Track <-> Player.
                        -> other tracks   -> rendered

17.  Unknown elements

   Matroska is based upon the principle that a reading application does
   not have to support 100% of the specifications in order to be able to
   play the file.  A Matroska file therefore contains version indicators
   that tell a reading application what to expect.

   It is possible and valid to have the version fields indicate that the
   file contains Matroska "Elements" from a higher specification version
   number while signaling that a reading application MUST only support a
   lower version number properly in order to play it back (possibly with
   a reduced feature set).  For example, a reading application
   supporting at least Matroska version "V" reading a file whose
   "DocTypeReadVersion" field is equal to or lower than "V" MUST skip
   Matroska/EBML "Elements" it encounters but does not know about if
   that unknown element fits into the size constraints set by the
   current "Parent Element".

18.  Default Values

   The default value of an "Element" is assumed when not present in the
   data stream.  It is assumed only in the scope of its "Parent
   Element".  For example, the "Language Element" is in the scope of the
   "Track Element".  If the "Parent Element" is not present or assumed,
   then the "Child Element" cannot be assumed.

19.  DefaultDecodedFieldDuration

   The "DefaultDecodedFieldDuration Element" can signal to the
   displaying application how often fields of a video sequence will be
   available for displaying.  It can be used for both interlaced and
   progressive content.  If the video sequence is signaled as
   interlaced, then the period between two successive fields at the
   output of the decoding process equals "DefaultDecodedFieldDuration".



Lhomme, et al.           Expires 19 October 2020              [Page 155]

Internet-Draft               Matroska Format                  April 2020


   For video sequences signaled as progressive, it is twice the value of
   "DefaultDecodedFieldDuration".

   These values are valid at the end of the decoding process before
   post-processing (such as deinterlacing or inverse telecine) is
   applied.

   Examples:

   *  Blu-ray movie: 1000000000ns/(48/1.001) = 20854167ns

   *  PAL broadcast/DVD: 1000000000ns/(50/1.000) = 20000000ns

   *  N/ATSC broadcast: 1000000000ns/(60/1.001) = 16683333ns

   *  hard-telecined DVD: 1000000000ns/(60/1.001) = 16683333ns (60
      encoded interlaced fields per second)

   *  soft-telecined DVD: 1000000000ns/(60/1.001) = 16683333ns (48
      encoded interlaced fields per second, with "repeat_first_field =
      1")

20.  Encryption

   Encryption in Matroska is designed in a very generic style to allow
   people to implement whatever form of encryption is best for them.  It
   is possible to use the encryption framework in Matroska as a type of
   DRM (Digital Rights Management).

   Because encryption occurs within the "Block Element", it is possible
   to manipulate encrypted streams without decrypting them.  The streams
   could potentially be copied, deleted, cut, appended, or any number of
   other possible editing techniques without decryption.  The data can
   be used without having to expose it or go through the decrypting
   process.

   Encryption can also be layered within Matroska.  This means that two
   completely different types of encryption can be used, requiring two
   separate keys to be able to decrypt a stream.

   Encryption information is stored in the "ContentEncodings Element"
   under the "ContentEncryption Element".

21.  Image Presentation

Internet-Draft               Matroska Format                  April 2020


21.1.  Cropping

   The "PixelCrop Elements" ("PixelCropTop", "PixelCropBottom",
   "PixelCropRight" and "PixelCropLeft") indicate when and by how much
   encoded videos frames SHOULD be cropped for display.  These Elements
   allow edges of the frame that are not intended for display, such as
   the sprockets of a full-frame film scan or the VANC area of a
   digitized analog videotape, to be stored but hidden.  "PixelCropTop"
   and "PixelCropBottom" store an integer of how many rows of pixels
   SHOULD be cropped from the top and bottom of the image
   (respectively).  "PixelCropLeft" and "PixelCropRight" store an
   integer of how many columns of pixels SHOULD be cropped from the left
   and right of the image (respectively).  For example, a pillar-boxed
   video that stores a 1440x1080 visual image within the center of a
   padded 1920x1080 encoded image MAY set both "PixelCropLeft" and
   "PixelCropRight" to "240", so that a "Matroska Player" SHOULD crop
   off 240 columns of pixels from the left and right of the encoded
   image to present the image with the pillar-boxes hidden.

21.2.  Rotation

   The ProjectionPoseRoll Element (see Section 10.4.1.31.20.5) can be
   used to indicate that the image from the associated video track
   SHOULD be rotated for presentation.  For instance, the following
   representation of the Projection Element Section 10.4.1.31.20) and
   the ProjectionPoseRoll Element represents a video track where the
   image SHOULD be presentation with a 90 degree counter-clockwise
   rotation.

   <Projection>
     <ProjectionPoseRoll>90</ProjectionPoseRoll>
   </Projection>

22.  Matroska versioning

   The "EBML Header" of each Matroska document informs the reading
   application on what version of Matroska to expect.  The "Elements"
   within "EBML Header" with jurisdiction over this information are
   "DocTypeVersion" and "DocTypeReadVersion".

   "DocTypeVersion" MUST be equal to or greater than the highest
   Matroska version number of any "Element" present in the Matroska
   file.  For example, a file using the "SimpleBlock Element" MUST have
   a "DocTypeVersion" equal to or greater than 2.  A file containing
   "CueRelativePosition" Elements MUST have a "DocTypeVersion" equal to
   or greater than 4.

Internet-Draft               Matroska Format                  April 2020


   The "DocTypeReadVersion" MUST contain the minimum version number that
   a reading application can minimally support in order to play the file
   back -- optionally with a reduced feature set.  For example, if a
   file contains only "Elements" of version 2 or lower except for
   "CueRelativePosition" (which is a version 4 Matroska "Element"), then
   "DocTypeReadVersion" SHOULD still be set to 2 and not 4 because
   evaluating "CueRelativePosition" is not necessary for standard
   playback -- it makes seeking more precise if used.

   "DocTypeVersion" MUST always be equal to or greater than
   "DocTypeReadVersion".

   A reading application supporting Matroska version "V" MUST NOT refuse
   to read an application with "DocReadTypeVersion" equal to or lower
   than "V" even if "DocTypeVersion" is greater than "V".  See also the
   note about Unknown Elements (#unknown-elements).

23.  MIME Types

   There is no IETF endorsed MIME type for Matroska files.  These
   definitions can be used:

   *  .mka : Matroska audio "audio/x-matroska"

   *  .mkv : Matroska video "video/x-matroska"

   *  .mk3d : Matroska 3D video "video/x-matroska-3d"

24.  Segment Position

   The "Segment Position" of an "Element" refers to the position of the
   first octet of the "Element ID" of that "Element", measured in
   octets, from the beginning of the "Element Data" section of the
   containing "Segment Element".  In other words, the "Segment Position"
   of an "Element" is the distance in octets from the beginning of its
   containing "Segment Element" minus the size of the "Element ID" and
   "Element Data Size" of that "Segment Element".  The "Segment
   Position" of the first "Child Element" of the "Segment Element" is 0.
   An "Element" which is not stored within a "Segment Element", such as
   the "Elements" of the "EBML Header", do not have a "Segment
   Position".

24.1.  Segment Position Exception

   "Elements" that are defined to store a "Segment Position" MAY define
   reserved values to indicate a special meaning.

24.2.  Example of Segment Position

   This table presents an example of "Segment Position" by showing a
   hexadecimal representation of a very small Matroska file with labels
   to show the offsets in octets.  The file contains a "Segment Element"
   with an "Element ID" of "0x18538067" and a "MuxingApp Element" with
   an "Element ID" of "0x4D80".

        0                             1                             2
        0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0
        +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
      0 |1A|45|DF|A3|8B|42|82|88|6D|61|74|72|6F|73|6B|61|18|53|80|67|
     20 |93|15|49|A9|66|8E|4D|80|84|69|65|74|66|57|41|84|69|65|74|66|

   In the above example, the "Element ID" of the "Segment Element" is
   stored at offset 16, the "Element Data Size" of the "Segment Element"
   is stored at offset 20, and the "Element Data" of the "Segment
   Element" is stored at offset 21.

   The "MuxingApp Element" is stored at offset 26.  Since the "Segment
   Position" of an "Element" is calculated by subtracting the position
   of the "Element Data" of the containing "Segment Element" from the
   position of that "Element", the "Segment Position" of "MuxingApp
   Element" in the above example is "26 - 21" or "5".

25.  Linked Segments

   Matroska provides several methods to link two or many "Segment
   Elements" together to create a "Linked Segment".  A "Linked Segment"
   is a set of multiple "Segments" related together into a single
   presentation by using Hard Linking, Medium Linking, or Soft Linking.
   All "Segments" within a "Linked Segment" MUST utilize the same track
   numbers and timescale.  All "Segments" within a "Linked Segment" MUST
   be stored within the same directory.  All "Segments" within a "Linked
   Segment" MUST store a "SegmentUID".

25.1.  Hard Linking

   Hard Linking (also called splitting) is the process of creating a
   "Linked Segment" by relating multiple "Segment Elements" using the
   "NextUID" and "PrevUID" Elements.  Within a "Linked Segment", the
   timestamps of each "Segment" MUST follow consecutively in linking
   order.  With Hard Linking, the chapters of any "Segment" within the
   "Linked Segment" MUST only reference the current "Segment".  With
   Hard Linking, the "NextUID" and "PrevUID" MUST reference the
   respective "SegmentUID" values of the next and previous "Segments".
   The first "Segment" of a "Linked Segment" SHOULD have a "NextUID
   Element" and MUST NOT have a "PrevUID Element".  The last "Segment"



Lhomme, et al.           Expires 19 October 2020              [Page 159]

Internet-Draft               Matroska Format                  April 2020


   of a "Linked Segment" SHOULD have a "PrevUID Element" and MUST NOT
   have a "NextUID Element".  The middle "Segments" of a "Linked
   Segment" SHOULD have both a "NextUID Element" and a "PrevUID
   Element".

   In a chain of "Linked Segments" the "NextUID" always takes precedence
   over the "PrevUID".  So if SegmentA has a NextUID to SegmentB and
   SegmentB has a PrevUID to SegmentC, the link to use is SegmentA to
   SegmentB.  If SegmentB has a PrevUID to SegmentA but SegmentA has no
   NextUID, then the Matroska Player MAY consider these two Segments
   linked as SegmentA followed by SegmentB.

   As an example, three "Segments" can be Hard Linked as a "Linked
   Segment" through cross-referencing each other with "SegmentUID",
   "PrevUID", and "NextUID", as in this table.

25.2.  Medium Linking

   Medium Linking creates relationships between "Segments" using Ordered
   Chapters and the "ChapterSegmentUID Element".  A "Segment Edition"
   with Ordered Chapters MAY contain "Chapter Elements" that reference
   timestamp ranges from other "Segments".  The "Segment" referenced by
   the Ordered Chapter via the "ChapterSegmentUID Element" SHOULD be
   played as part of a Linked Segment.  The timestamps of Segment
   content referenced by Ordered Chapters MUST be adjusted according to
   the cumulative duration of the the previous Ordered Chapters.

Internet-Draft               Matroska Format                  April 2020


   As an example a file named "intro.mkv" could have a "SegmentUID" of
   "0xb16a58609fc7e60653a60c984fc11ead".  Another file called
   "program.mkv" could use a Chapter Edition that contains two Ordered
   Chapters.  The first chapter references the "Segment" of "intro.mkv"
   with the use of a "ChapterSegmentUID", "ChapterSegmentEditionUID",
   "ChapterTimeStart" and optionally a "ChapterTimeEnd" element.  The
   second chapter references content within the "Segment" of
   "program.mkv".  A "Matroska Player" SHOULD recognize the "Linked
   Segment" created by the use of "ChapterSegmentUID" in an enabled
   "Edition" and present the reference content of the two "Segments"
   together.

25.3.  Soft Linking

   Soft Linking is used by codec chapters.  They can reference another
   "Segment" and jump to that "Segment".  The way the "Segments" are
   described are internal to the chapter codec and unknown to the
   Matroska level.  But there are "Elements" within the "Info Element"
   (such as "ChapterTranslate") that can translate a value representing
   a "Segment" in the chapter codec and to the current "SegmentUID".
   All "Segments" that could be used in a "Linked Segment" in this way
   SHOULD be marked as members of the same family via the "SegmentFamily
   Element", so that the "Matroska Player" can quickly switch from one
   to the other.

26.  Track Flags

26.1.  Default flag

   The "default track" flag is a hint for a "Matroska Player" and SHOULD
   always be changeable by the user.  If the user wants to see or hear a
   track of a certain kind (audio, video, subtitles) and hasn't chosen a
   specific track, the "Matroska Player" SHOULD use the first track of
   that kind whose "default track" flag is set to "1".  If no such track
   is found then the first track of this kind SHOULD be chosen.

   Only one track of a kind MAY have its "default track" flag set in a
   segment.  If a track entry does not contain the "default track" flag
   element then its default value "1" is to be used.

26.2.  Forced flag

   The "forced" flag tells the "Matroska Player" that it MUST display/
   play this track or another track of the same kind that also has its
   "forced" flag set.  When there are multiple "forced" tracks, the
   "Matroska Player" SHOULD determine the track based upon the language
   of the forced flag or use the default flag if no track matches the
   use languages.  Another track of the same kind without the "forced"

Internet-Draft               Matroska Format                  April 2020


   flag may be use simultaneously with the "forced" track (like DVD
   subtitles for example).

26.3.  Track Operation

   "TrackOperation" allows combining multiple tracks to make a virtual
   one.  It uses two separate system to combine tracks.  One to create a
   3D "composition" (left/right/background planes) and one to simplify
   join two tracks together to make a single track.

   A track created with "TrackOperation" is a proper track with a UID
   and all its flags.  However the codec ID is meaningless because each
   "sub" track needs to be decoded by its own decoder before the
   "operation" is applied.  The "Cues Elements" corresponding to such a
   virtual track SHOULD be the sum of the "Cues Elements" for each of
   the tracks it's composed of (when the "Cues" are defined per track).

   In the case of "TrackJoinBlocks", the "Block Elements" (from
   "BlockGroup" and "SimpleBlock") of all the tracks SHOULD be used as
   if they were defined for this new virtual "Track".  When two "Block
   Elements" have overlapping start or end timestamps, it's up to the
   underlying system to either drop some of these frames or render them
   the way they overlap.  This situation SHOULD be avoided when creating
   such tracks as you can never be sure of the end result on different
   platforms.

26.4.  Overlay Track

   Overlay tracks SHOULD be rendered in the same 'channel' as the track
   its linked to.  When content is found in such a track, it SHOULD be
   played on the rendering channel instead of the original track.

26.5.  Multi-planar and 3D videos

   There are two different ways to compress 3D videos: have each 'eye'
   track in a separate track and have one track have both 'eyes'
   combined inside (which is more efficient, compression-wise).
   Matroska supports both ways.

Internet-Draft               Matroska Format                  April 2020


   For the single track variant, there is the "StereoMode Element" which
   defines how planes are assembled in the track (mono or left-right
   combined).  Odd values of StereoMode means the left plane comes first
   for more convenient reading.  The pixel count of the track
   ("PixelWidth"/"PixelHeight") is the raw amount of pixels (for example
   3840x1080 for full HD side by side) and the
   "DisplayWidth"/"DisplayHeight" in pixels is the amount of pixels for
   one plane (1920x1080 for that full HD stream).  Old stereo 3D were
   displayed using anaglyph (cyan and red colours separated).  For
   compatibility with such movies, there is a value of the StereoMode
   that corresponds to AnaGlyph.

   There is also a "packed" mode (values 13 and 14) which consists of
   packing two frames together in a "Block" using lacing.  The first
   frame is the left eye and the other frame is the right eye (or vice
   versa).  The frames SHOULD be decoded in that order and are possibly
   dependent on each other (P and B frames).

   For separate tracks, Matroska needs to define exactly which track
   does what.  "TrackOperation" with "TrackCombinePlanes" do that.  For
   more details look at how TrackOperation works (#track-operation).

   The 3D support is still in infancy and may evolve to support more
   features.

   The StereoMode used to be part of Matroska v2 but it didn't meet the
   requirement for multiple tracks.  There was also a bug in libmatroska
   prior to 0.9.0 that would save/read it as 0x53B9 instead of 0x53B8.
   "Matroska Readers" may support these legacy files by checking
   Matroska v2 or 0x53B9.  The older values
   (http://www.matroska.org/node/1/revisions/74/view#StereoMode) were 0:
   mono, 1: right eye, 2: left eye, 3: both eyes.

27.  Timestamps

   Historically timestamps in Matroska were mistakenly called timecodes.
   The "Timestamp Element" was called Timecode, the "TimestampScale
   Element" was called TimecodeScale, the "TrackTimestampScale Element"
   was called TrackTimecodeScale and the "ReferenceTimestamp Element"
   was called ReferenceTimeCode.

27.1.  Timestamp Types

   *  Absolute Timestamp = Block+Cluster

   *  Relative Timestamp = Block

   *  Scaled Timestamp = Block+Cluster



Lhomme, et al.           Expires 19 October 2020              [Page 164]

Internet-Draft               Matroska Format                  April 2020


   *  Raw Timestamp = (Block+Cluster)*TimestampScale*TrackTimestampScale

27.2.  Block Timestamps

   The "Block Element"'s timestamp MUST be a signed integer that
   represents the "Raw Timestamp" relative to the "Cluster"'s "Timestamp
   Element", multiplied by the "TimestampScale Element".  See
   TimestampScale (#timestampscale) for more information.

   The "Block Element"'s timestamp MUST be represented by a 16bit signed
   integer (sint16).  The "Block"'s timestamp has a range of -32768 to
   +32767 units.  When using the default value of the "TimestampScale
   Element", each integer represents 1ms.  The maximum time span of
   "Block Elements" in a "Cluster" using the default "TimestampScale
   Element" of 1ms is 65536ms.

   If a "Cluster"'s "Timestamp Element" is set to zero, it is possible
   to have "Block Elements" with a negative "Raw Timestamp".  "Block
   Elements" with a negative "Raw Timestamp" are not valid.

27.3.  Raw Timestamp

   The exact time of an object SHOULD be represented in nanoseconds.  To
   find out a "Block"'s "Raw Timestamp", you need the "Block"'s
   "Timestamp Element", the "Cluster"'s "Timestamp Element", and the
   "TimestampScale Element".

27.4.  TimestampScale

   The "TimestampScale Element" is used to calculate the "Raw Timestamp"
   of a "Block".  The timestamp is obtained by adding the "Block"'s
   timestamp to the "Cluster"'s "Timestamp Element", and then
   multiplying that result by the "TimestampScale".  The result will be
   the "Block"'s "Raw Timestamp" in nanoseconds.  The formula for this
   would look like:

   (a + b) * c

   a = `Block`'s Timestamp
   b = `Cluster`'s Timestamp
   c = `TimestampScale`

   For example, assume a "Cluster"'s "Timestamp" has a value of 564264,
   the "Block" has a "Timestamp" of 1233, and the "TimestampScale
   Element" is the default of 1000000.

   (1233 + 564264) * 1000000 = 565497000000

Internet-Draft               Matroska Format                  April 2020


   So, the "Block" in this example has a specific time of 565497000000
   in nanoseconds.  In milliseconds this would be 565497ms.

27.5.  TimestampScale Rounding

   Because the default value of "TimestampScale" is 1000000, which makes
   each integer in the "Cluster" and "Block" "Timestamp Elements" equal
   1ms, this is the most commonly used.  When dealing with audio, this
   causes inaccuracy when seeking.  When the audio is combined with
   video, this is not an issue.  For most cases, the the synch of audio
   to video does not need to be more than 1ms accurate.  This becomes
   obvious when one considers that sound will take 2-3ms to travel a
   single meter, so distance from your speakers will have a greater
   effect on audio/visual synch than this.

   However, when dealing with audio-only files, seeking accuracy can
   become critical.  For instance, when storing a whole CD in a single
   track, a user will want to be able to seek to the exact sample that a
   song begins at.  If seeking a few sample ahead or behind, a 'crack'
   or 'pop' may result as a few odd samples are rendered.  Also, when
   performing precise editing, it may be very useful to have the audio
   accuracy down to a single sample.

   When storing timestamps for an audio stream, the "TimestampScale
   Element" SHOULD have an accuracy of at least that of the audio sample
   rate, otherwise there are rounding errors that prevent users from
   knowing the precise location of a sample.  Here's how a program has
   to round each timestamp in order to be able to recreate the sample
   number accurately.

   Let's assume that the application has an audio track with a sample
   rate of 44100.  As written above the "TimestampScale" MUST have at
   least the accuracy of the sample rate itself: 1000000000 / 44100 =
   22675.7369614512.  This value MUST always be truncated.  Otherwise
   the accuracy will not suffice.  So in this example the application
   will use 22675 for the "TimestampScale".  The application could even
   use some lower value like 22674 which would allow it to be a little
   bit imprecise about the original timestamps.  But more about that in
   a minute.

   Next the application wants to write sample number 52340 and
   calculates the timestamp.  This is easy.  In order to calculate the
   "Raw Timestamp" in ns all it has to do is calculate "Raw Timestamp =
   round(1000000000 * sample_number / sample_rate)".  Rounding at this
   stage is very important!  The application might skip it if it choses
   a slightly smaller value for the "TimestampScale" factor instead of
   the truncated one like shown above.  Otherwise it has to round or the
   results won't be reversible.  For our example we get "Raw Timestamp =
   round(1000000000 * 52340 / 44100) = round(1186848072.56236) =
   1186848073".

   The next step is to calculate the "Absolute Timestamp" - that is the
   timestamp that will be stored in the Matroska file.  Here the
   application has to divide the "Raw Timestamp" from the previous
   paragraph by the "TimestampScale" factor and round the result:
   "Absolute Timestamp = round(Raw Timestamp / TimestampScale_factor)"
   which will result in the following for our example: "Absolute
   Timestamp = round(1186848073 / 22675) = round(52341.7011245866) =
   52342".  This number is the one the application has to write to the
   file.

   Now our file is complete, and we want to play it back with another
   application.  Its task is to find out which sample the first
   application wrote into the file.  So it starts reading the Matroska
   file and finds the "TimestampScale" factor 22675 and the audio sample
   rate 44100.  Later it finds a data block with the "Absolute
   Timestamp" of 52342.  But how does it get the sample number from
   these numbers?

   First it has to calculate the "Raw Timestamp" of the block it has
   just read.  Here's no rounding involved, just an integer
   multiplication: "Raw Timestamp = Absolute Timestamp *
   TimestampScale_factor".  In our example: "Raw Timestamp = 52342 *
   22675 = 1186854850".

   The conversion from the "Raw Timestamp" to the sample number again
   requires rounding: "sample_number = round(Raw Timestamp * sample_rate
   / 1000000000)".  In our example: "sample_number = round(1186854850 *
   44100 / 1000000000) = round(52340.298885) = 52340".  This is exactly
   the sample number that the previous program started with.

   Some general notes for a program:

   1.  Always calculate the timestamps / sample numbers with floating
       point numbers of at least 64bit precision (called 'double' in
       most modern programming languages).  If you're calculating with
       integers then make sure they're 64bit long, too.

   2.  Always round if you divide.  Always!  If you don't you'll end up
       with situations in which you have a timestamp in the Matroska
       file that does not correspond to the sample number that it
       started with.  Using a slightly lower timestamp scale factor can
       help here in that it removes the need for proper rounding in the
       conversion from sample number to "Raw Timestamp".

27.6.  TrackTimestampScale

   The "TrackTimestampScale Element" is used align tracks that would
   otherwise be played at different speeds.  An example of this would be
   if you have a film that was originally recorded at 24fps video.  When
   playing this back through a PAL broadcasting system, it is standard
   to speed up the film to 25fps to match the 25fps display speed of the
   PAL broadcasting standard.  However, when broadcasting the video
   through NTSC, it is typical to leave the film at its original speed.
   If you wanted to make a single file where there was one video stream,
   and an audio stream used from the PAL broadcast, as well as an audio
   stream used from the NTSC broadcast, you would have the problem that
   the PAL audio stream would be 1/24th faster than the NTSC audio
   stream, quickly leading to problems.  It is possible to stretch out
   the PAL audio track and re-encode it at a slower speed, however when
   dealing with lossy audio codecs, this often results in a loss of
   audio quality and/or larger file sizes.

   This is the type of problem that "TrackTimestampScale" was designed
   to fix.  Using it, the video can be played back at a speed that will
   synch with either the NTSC or the PAL audio stream, depending on
   which is being used for playback.  To continue the above example:

   Track 1: Video
   Track 2: NTSC Audio
   Track 3: PAL Audio

   Because the NTSC track is at the original speed, it will used as the
   default value of 1.0 for its "TrackTimestampScale".  The video will
   also be aligned to the NTSC track with the default value of 1.0.

   The "TrackTimestampScale" value to use for the PAL track would be
   calculated by determining how much faster the PAL track is than the
   NTSC track.  In this case, because we know the video for the NTSC
   audio is being played back at 24fps and the video for the PAL audio
   is being played back at 25fps, the calculation would be:

   25/24 is almost 1.04166666666666666667

   When writing a file that uses a non-default "TrackTimestampScale",
   the values of the "Block"'s timestamp are whatever they would be when
   normally storing the track with a default value for the
   "TrackTimestampScale".  However, the data is interleaved a little
   differently.  Data SHOULD be interleaved by its Raw Timestamp (#raw-
   timestamp) in the order handed back from the encoder.  The "Raw
   Timestamp" of a "Block" from a track using "TrackTimestampScale" is
   calculated using:

   "(Block's Timestamp + Cluster's Timestamp) * TimestampScale *
   TrackTimestampScale"

   So, a Block from the PAL track above that had a Scaled Timestamp
   (#timestamp-types) of 100 seconds would have a "Raw Timestamp" of
   104.66666667 seconds, and so would be stored in that part of the
   file.

   When playing back a track using the "TrackTimestampScale", if the
   track is being played by itself, there is no need to scale it.  From
   the above example, when playing the Video with the NTSC Audio,
   neither are scaled.  However, when playing back the Video with the
   PAL Audio, the timestamps from the PAL Audio track are scaled using
   the "TrackTimestampScale", resulting in the video playing back in
   synch with the audio.

   It would be possible for a "Matroska Player" to also adjust the
   audio's samplerate at the same time as adjusting the timestamps if
   you wanted to play the two audio streams synchronously.  It would
   also be possible to adjust the video to match the audio's speed.
   However, for playback, the selected track(s) timestamps SHOULD be
   adjusted if they need to be scaled.

   While the above example deals specifically with audio tracks, this
   element can be used to align video, audio, subtitles, or any other
   type of track contained in a Matroska file.
