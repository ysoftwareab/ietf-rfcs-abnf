     Abstract 

        Shared mesh protection is a common protection and recovery mechanism 
        in transport networks, where multiple paths can share the same set 
        of network resources for protection purposes. 

        In the context of MPLS-TP, it has been explicitly requested as a 
        part of the overall solution (Req. 67, 68 and 69 in RFC5654 [1]). 

        It's important to note that each MPLS-TP LSP may be associated with 
        transport network resources. In event of network failure, it may 
        require explicit activation on the protecting paths before switching 
        user traffic over. 

        In this memo, we define a lightweight signaling mechanism for 
        protecting path activation in shared mesh protection-enabled MPLS-TP 
        networks.

     1. Introduction 

        Shared mesh protection is a common protection and recovery mechanism 
        in transport networks, where multiple paths can share the same set 
        of network resources for protection purposes. 

        In the context of MPLS-TP, it has been explicitly requested as a 
        part of the overall solution (Req. 67, 68 and 69 in RFC5654 [1]).Its 
        operation has been further outlined in Section 4.7.6 of MPLS-TP 
        Survivability Framework [2]. 

        It's important to note that each MPLS-TP LSP may be associated with 
        transport network resources. In event of network failure, it may 
        require explicit activation on the protecting paths before switching 
        user traffic over. 

        In this memo, we define a lightweight signaling mechanism for 
        protecting path activation in shared mesh protection-enabled MPLS-TP 
        networks. 

        Here are the key design goals:

        1. Fast: The protocol is to activate the previously configured 
          protecting paths in a timely fashion, with minimal transport and 
          processing overhead. The goal is to support 50msec end-to-end 
          traffic switch-over in large transport networks. 
           
        2. Reliable message delivery: Activation and deactivation operation 
          have serious impact on user traffic. This requires the protocol to 
          adapt a low-overhead reliable messaging mechanism. 
           
        3. Modular: Depending on deployment scenarios, the signaling may need 
          to support functions such as preemption, resource re-allocation 
          and bi-directional activation in a modular fashion. 

        Here are some of the conventions used in this document. The key 
        words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
        document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119]. 

         

     2. Background and Problem Definition 

        In this section, we describe the operation of shared mesh protection 
        in the context of MPLS-TP networks, and outline some of the relevant 
        definitions. 

        We refer to the figure below for illustration: 

                ----- B ------- C ---- 
               /                      \ 
              /                        \ 
             A                          D 
              \                        / 
               \                      / 
                ==== E === F === G === 
               /                      \ 
              /                        \ 
             H                          K 
              \                        / 
               \                      / 
                ----- I ------- J ---- 
         

        Working paths: X = {A, B, C, D}, Y = {H, I, J, K} 

        Protecting paths: X' = {A, E, F, G, D}, Y' = {H, E, F, G, K}

        The links between E, F and G are shared by both protecting paths. 
        All paths are established via MPLS-TP control plane prior to network 
        failure. 

        All paths are assumed to be bi-directional. An edge node is denoted 
        as a headend or tailend for a particular path in accordance to the 
        path setup direction. 

        Initially, the operators setup both working and protecting paths. 
        During setup, the operators specify the network resources for each 
        path. 

        The working path X and Y will configure the appropriate resources on 
        the intermediate nodes, however, the protecting paths, X' and Y', 
        will reserve the resources on the nodes, but won't occupy them. 

        Depending on network planning requirements (such as SRLG), X' and Y' 
        may share the same set of resources on node E, F and G. The resource 
        assignment is a part of the control-plane CAC operation taking place 
        on each node. 

        At some time, link B-C is cut. Node A will detect the outage, and 
        initiate activation messages to bring up the protecting path X'. The 
        intermediate nodes, E, F and G will program the switch fabric and 
        configure the appropriate resources. Upon the completion of the 
        activation, A will switch the user traffic to X'. 

        The operation may have extra caveat: 

          1. Preemption: Protecting paths X' and Y' may share the same 
             resources on node E, F or G due to resource constraints. Y' has 
             higher priority than that of X'. In the previous example, X' is 
             up and running. When there is a link outage on I-J, H can 
             activate its protecting path Y'. On E, F or G, Y' can take over 
             the resources from X' for its own traffic. The behavior is 
             acceptable with the condition that A should be notified about 
             the preemption action. 
              
          2. Over-subscription (1:N): A unit of network resource may be 
             reserved by one or multiple protecting paths. In the example, 
             the network resources on E-F and F-G are shared by two 
             protecting paths, X' and Y'. In deployment, the over-
             subscription ratio is an important factor on network resource 
             utilization.

          3. Bi-direction Activation: The bi-directional paths can activate 
             protection from both headend and tailend independently. In the 
             example, upon the failure on link B-C, both A and D can trigger 
             the activation of the protecting path X'. This procedure may 
             improve the switch-over performance; however, it requires 
             additional coordination between network nodes. 

         

     3. Protection Switching 

        The entire activation and switch-over operation need to be within 
        the range of milliseconds to meet customer's expectation. In this 
        section, we illustrate how this may be achieved on MPLS-TP-enabled 
        transport switches. Note that this is for illustration of protection 
        switching operation, not mandating the implementation itself. 

        The diagram below illustrates the operation. 

                                 +---------------+

                                  /              \ (MPLS label assignment) 
                                 /                \ 
                                /                  \ 
                          +-------+   +------+   +-------+

        A typical MPLS-TP user flow (or, LSP) is bi-directional, with a MPLS 
        label for each of the upstream and downstream traffic. On this 
        particular type of transport switch, the control-plane can download 
        the labels to the line modules. Subsequently, the line module will 
        maintain a label lookup table on all working and protecting paths. 

        Upon the detection of network failure, the headend nodes will 
        transmit activation messages along the MPLS LSP's. When receiving 
        the messages, the line modules can locate the associated protecting 
        path from the label lookup table, and perform activation procedure 
        by programming the switching fabric directly. Upon its success, the 
        line module will swap the label, and forward the activation messages 
        to the next hop.

        In summary, the activation procedure involves efficient path lookup 
        and switch fabric re-programming. 

        To achieve the tight end-to-end switch-over budget, it's possible to 
        implement the entire activation procedure with hardware-assistance 
        (such as in FPGA or ASIC). 

        The activation messages are encapsulated with a MPLS-TP Generic 
        Associated Channel Header (GACH) [3]. Detailed message encoding is 
        explained in Section 5. 

         

     4. Activation Operation Overview 

        In this section, we describe the activation procedure using the same 
        figure shown before: 

                ----- B ------- C ---- 
               /                      \ 
              /                        \ 
             A                          D 
              \                        / 
               \                      / 
                ==== E === F === G === 
               /                      \ 
              /                        \ 
             H                          K 
              \                        / 
               \                      / 
                ----- I ------- J ---- 
         

        Working paths: X = {A, B, C, D}, Y = {H, I, J, K} 

        Protecting paths: X' = {A, E, F, G, D}, Y' = {H, E, F, G, K} 

        Upon the detection of working path failure, the edge nodes, A, D, H 
        and K may trigger the activation messages to activate the protecting 
        paths, and redirect user traffic immediately after. 

        We assume that there is a consistent definition of priority levels 
        among the paths throughout the network. At activation time, each 
        node may rely on the priority levels to potentially preempt other 
        paths.

        When the nodes detect path preemption on a particular node, they 
        should inform all relevant nodes to free the resources. 

        To optimize traffic protection and resource management, each headend 
        should periodically poll the protecting paths about resource 
        availability. The intermediate nodes have the option to inform the 
        current resource utilization. 

        Note that, upon the detection of a working path failure, both 
        headend and tailend may initiate the activation simultaneously 
        (known as bi-directional activation). This may expedite the 
        activation time. However, both headend and tailend nodes need to 
        coordinate the order of protecting paths for activation, since there 
        may be multiple protecting paths for each working path (i.e., 1:N 
        protection). For clarity, we will describe the operation from 
        headend in the memo. The tailend operation will be available in the 
        subsequent revisions. 

         

     5. Protocol Definition 

     5.1. Activation Messages 

        The activation requires the following messages: 

        o  ENABLE: this is initiated by the headend nodes to activate a 
           protecting path 

        o  DISABLE: this is initiated by the headend nodes to disable a 
           protecting path and free the associated network resources 

        o  GET: this is initiated by the headend to gather resource 
           availability information on a particular protecting path 

        o  NOTIFY: this is initiated by the intermediate nodes and terminate 
           on the headend nodes to report preemption or protection failure 
           conditions 

        o  STATUS: this is the acknowledgement message for ENABLE, DISABLE, 
           GET, and NOTIFY messages, and contains the relevant status 
           information

     5.3. Reliable Messaging 

        The activation procedure adapts a simple two-way handshake reliable 
        messaging. 

        Each node maintains a sequence number generator. Each new sending 
        message will have a new sequence number. After sending a message, 
        the node will wait for a response with the same sequence number. 
      
      
     Pan et.al             Expires September 7, 2011               [Page 11]

        Specifically, upon the generation of ENABLE, DISABLE, GET and NOTIFY 
        messages, the message sender expects to receive a STATUS in reply 
        with same sequence number. 

        If a sender is not getting the reply (STATUS) within a time 
        interval, it will retransmit the same message with a new sequence 
        number, and starts to wait again. After multiple retries (by 
        default, 3), the sender will declare activation failure, and alarm 
        the operators for further service. 

     5.4. Message Scoping 

        Activation signaling uses MPLS TTL to control how far the message 
        would traverse. Here are the processing rules on each intermediate 
        node: 

        o  On receive, if the message has TTL = 0, the node must drop the 
           packet without further processing 

        o  The receiving node must always decrement the TTL value by one. If 
           TTL = 0 after the decrement, the node must process the message. 
           Otherwise, the node must forward the message without further 
           processing (unless, of course, the node is headend or tailend) 

        o  On transmission, the node will adjust the TTL value. For hop-by-
           hop messages, TTL = 1. Otherwise, TTL = 0xFF, by default. 

      

     6. Processing Rules 

     6.1. Enable a protecting path 

        Upon the detection of network failure on a working path, the headend 
        node initiates the protection switching by sending an ENABLE 
        message. 

        ENABLE messages always use MPLS TTL one to force hop-by-hop process. 
        Upon reception, a next-hop node will locate the corresponding path 
        and activate the path.  

        The headend node will declare the success of the activation only 
        when it gets a positive reply from the tailend node. This requires 
        that the tailend nodes must reply STATUS messages to the headend 
        nodes in all cases. 


      
      
     Pan et.al             Expires September 7, 2011               [Page 12]

        If the headend node is not receiving the acknowledgement within a 
        time internal, it will retransmit another ENABLE message with a 
        different Seq number. 

        If the headend node is not receiving a positive reply within a 
        longer time interval, it will declare activation failure. 

        If an intermediate node cannot activate a protecting path, it will 
        reply an NOTIFY message to report failure. When the headend node 
        receives a NOTIFY message, it must initiate DISABLE messages to 
        clean up networks resources on all the relevant nodes on the path. 

     6.2. Disable a protecting path 

        The headend removes the network resources on a path by sending 
        DISABLE messages. 

        In the message, the MPLS label represents the path to be de-
        activated. The MPLS TTL is one to force hop-by-hop processing. 

        Upon reception, a node will de-activate the path, by freeing the 
        resources from the data-plane.  

        As a part of the clean-up procedure, each DISABLE message must 
        traverse through and be processed on all the nodes of the 
        corresponding path. When the DISABLE message reaches to the tailend 
        node, the tailend is required to reply with a STATUS message to the 
        headend. 

        The de-activation process is complete when the headend receives the 
        corresponding STATUS message from the tailend. 

     6.3. Get protecting path status 

        The operators have the option to trigger GET messages from the 
        headend to check on the protecting path periodically or on-demand. 
        The process procedure on each node is very similar to that of ENABLE 
        messages on the intermediate nodes, except the GET messages should 
        not trigger any path re-programming. 

        Upon reception, the node will check the availability of resources. 

        If the resource is no longer available, the node will reply a NOTIFY 
        with error conditions.

     6.4. Acknowledgement with STATUS  

        The STATUS message is the acknowledgement packet to all messages, 
        and may be generated by any node in the network. 

        Each STATUS message must use the same sequence number as the 
        corresponding message (ENABLE, DISABLE, GET and NOTIFY). 

        When replying to headend, the tailend nodes must originate STATUS 
        messages will a large MPLS TTL value (0xff, by default).  

     6.5. Preemption 

        The preemption operation typically takes place when processing an 
        ENABLE message. 

        If the activating network resources have been used by another path 
        and carrying user traffic, the node needs to compare the priority 
        levels. 

        If the existing path has higher priority, the node needs to reject 
        the ENABLE message by sending a STATUS message to the corresponding 
        headend to inform the unavailability of network resources. 

        If the new path has higher priority, the node will reallocate the 
        resource to the new path, and send an NOTIFY message to old path's 
        headend node to inform about the preemption. 

     7. Security Consideration 

        The protection activation takes place in a controlled networking 
        environment. Nevertheless, it is expected that the edge nodes will 
        encapsulate and transport external traffic into separated tunnels, 
        and the intermediate nodes will never have to process them. 

     8. IANA Considerations 

        Activation messages are encapsulated in MPLS-TP with a specific GACH 
        channel type that needs to be assigned by IANA.
