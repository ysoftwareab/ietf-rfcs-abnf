Abstract 
    
   This document specifies a set of provisioning classes (PRC) for 
   configuring load balancing at load balancing devices. Instances of 
   these classes reside in a virtual information store called Load 
   Balancing Policy Information Base (PIB). COPS protocol [COPS] with 
   the extensions for provisioning [COPS-PR] may be used to transmit 
   this load balancing policy information to load balancing devices 
   (e.g., dedicated load balancers or load balancing switch).The PRCs 
   defined in this load balancing PIB are intended for use by the COPS- 
   PR load balancing client type. They complement the PRCs defined in 
   the Framework PIB [FR-PIB].

1. Introduction 
    
   Load Balancing is widely used to balance Internet traffic to and 
   from multiple servers at e-business data centers. Load balancers 
   could be dedicated devices just performing load balancing or the 
   load balancing functionality could be built into switches. Today, 
   load balancers from various vendors use proprietary methods to 
   manage these devices. It is becoming difficult manage various 
   devices found in an e-business data center since there is no 
   standard way to manage them. Policy Based Management (PBM), as 
   specified in [RAP-FRAMEWORK], is a good solution to manage load 
   balancers and many other devices usually found in e-business data 
   centers.  
    
   In PBM, using the configuration model, a Policy Decision Point (PDP) 
   downloads policies to Policy Enforcement Points (PEPs) whenever 
   required. One way to provision policy is by means of the COPS 
   protocol [COPS] with the extensions for provisioning [COPS-PR]. Load 
   balancers act as PEPs and a PDP can provision the required policies 
   to these devices.  
    
   This document specifies the format of policy information required 
   for load balancing in the form of PIB. The PIB contained in this 
   draft is written using SPPI (Structure of Policy Provisioning 
   Information) as specified in [SPPI]. It will be updated as SPPI 
   updates. This PIB specifies PRovisioning Classes (PRCs) for 
   configuring a load balancer.  
    
   The PRCs defined in this load balancing PIB are intended for use by 
   the COPS-PR load balancing client type.  Furthermore, these PRCs are 
   in addition the PRCs defined in the Framework PIB [FR-PIB]. 
    
    
2. Operation Overview 
    
   A brief description of interaction between PEP (load balancing 
   device) and PDP (policy server) is given in the next paragraph. For 
   a more detailed description of protocol exchange between PDP and 
   provisioning PEPs, please see [COPS-PR]. 
    
   Once TCP connection is established between the PEP and the PDP, the 
   PEP sends a Client-Open message to the PDP, specifying load 
   balancing client type. The PDP responds with a Client-Accept (CAT) 
   message. The PDP may send a Client-Close message, if it does not 
   recognize the load balancing client type. After receiving CAT 
   message, the PEP sends a request (REQ) message to the PDP. The REQ 
   message contains æconfiguration requestÆ context object and relevant 
   PIB class instances that include the PEPÆs capabilities, supported 
   PIB classes etc. The PDP then sends a Decision (DEC) message that 
   includes all the PIB classes that are used to configure the PEP. 
   They include filter groups, server groups, capabilities and service 
   classes that connect filter groups, server groups and capabilities.

   The PEP uses the information in the DEC message and configures 
   accordingly. The PEP then sends a Report-State (RPT) message to the 
   PDP indicating success or failure to install the policies. The PEP 
   may also send periodic RPT messages to inform about status of 
   installed policies or to convey accounting/monitoring type 
   information to the PDP. The PEP may issue updated REQ message if 
   there is any change in its status and the PDP may send updated DEC 
   message whenever necessary. The PEP can delete a request by sending 
   Delete-Request (DRQ) message to the PDP. The PDP may also ask the 
   PEP to delete an existing request state by sending a command via DEC 
   message. Finally, Client-Close (CC) message is used to cancel the 
   corresponding Client-Open message.  
    
    
3. Structure of Load Balancing PIB 
    
   The Load Balancing PIB consists of four main groups of PRCs. The 
   first group contains PRCs for classification of incoming packets. 
   The second group contains PRCs for load balancing capabilities or 
   properties. The third group contains PRCs for data center servers 
   and groups of servers. The fourth group contains PRCs for services 
   that essentially tie instances of the first three groups together. 
    
3.1. Classifier Classes 
    
   This group contains a PRC for extending the IP filter defined in 
   [FR-PIB] and a PRC for grouping of filters. A URL attribute is 
   defined by a set of three attributes that form the extended filter 
   used in the PIB. 
    
3.2. Capabilities Classes 
    
   This group contains a PRC that includes all the capabilities of a 
   load balancer. This PRC is used both for notifying capabilities by 
   PEP and for installing policies by PDP.  
    
3.3. Server Classes 
    
   This group contains a PRC for specifying a data center server and a 
   PRC for grouping of these servers. 
    
3.4. Service Classes 
    
   This group contains a PRC that defines a service by combining 
   instances of the other three classes mentioned above. Each instance 
   of this PRC contains a pointer to a filter-group instance, a pointer 
   to a capabilities instance and a pointer to a server-group instance, 
   thus defining a complete policy.

5. Security Considerations 
    
   The information contained in a PIB when transported by the COPS 
   protocol [COPS-PR] may be sensitive, and its function of provisioning 
   a PEP requires that only authorized communication take place.  The 
   use of IPSEC between PDP and PEP, as described in [COPS], provides 
   the necessary protection against these threats. For a more detailed 
   description of security considerations relevant to PIBs, please see 
   [FR-PIB].
