1. Introduction

   This paper summarizes a recommended correlation of applications to
   Differentiated Service Code Points.  There is no intrinsic
   requirement that individual DSCPs correspond to given applications,
   but as a policy it is useful if they can be applied consistently.

1.1 Expected use in the network

   In the Internet today, corporate LANs and ISP WANs are generally not
   heavily utilized - they are commonly 10% utilized at most.  For this
   reason, congestion, loss, and variation in delay within corporate
   LANs and ISP backbones is virtually unknown.  This clashes with user
   perceptions, for three very good reasons.

   o  The industry moves through cycles of bandwidth boom and bandwidth
      bust, depending on prevailing market conditions and the periodic
      deployment of new bandwidth-hungry applications.

   o  In access networks, the state is often different.  This may be
      because throughput rates are artificially limited, or because of
      access network design trade-offs.

   o  Other characteristics, such as database design on web servers
      (which may create contention points, e.g.  in filestore), and
      configuration of firewalls and routers, often look externally like
      a bandwidth limitation.

   The intent of this document is to provide a consistent marking
   strategy so that it can be configured and put into service on any
   link which finds itself congested, typically access links.

1.2 Key Differentiated Services concepts

   The reader must be familiar with the principles of the Differentiated
   Services Architecture [8].  However, we recapitulate key concepts
   here so save searching.

1.2.1 Queue or Class

   A queue or class is a data structure that holds traffic that is
   awaiting transmission.  The traffic will be delayed while in the
   queue, possibly due to lack of bandwidth, or because it is low in
   priority.  There are a number of ways to implement a queue; in some
   of these, it is more natural to discuss "classes in a queuing system"
   rather than "a set of queues and a scheduler".  In the literature, as
   a result, the concepts are used somewhat interchangeably.

Internet-Draft                  Document                       July 2002


   A simple model of a queuing system, however, is a set of data
   structures for packet data, which we will call queues or classes, and
   a mechanism for selecting the next packet from among them, which we
   call a scheduler.

1.2.1.1 Priority Queue

   A priority queuing system is a combination of a set of queues and a
   scheduler that empties them in priority sequence.  When asked for a
   packet, the scheduler inspects the first queue, and if there is data
   present returns a packet from that queue.  Failing that, it inspects
   the second queue, and so on.  A freeway onramp with a stoplight for
   one lane, but which allows vehicles in the high occupancy vehicle
   lane to pass, is an example of a priority queuing system; the high
   occupancy vehicle lane represents the "queue" having priority.

   In a priority queuing system, a packet in the highest priority queue
   will experience a readily calculated delay - it is proportional to
   the amount of data remaining to be serialized when the packet arrived
   plus the volume of the data already queued ahead of it in the same
   queue.  The technical reason for using a priority queue relates
   exactly to this fact: it limits variation in delay and delay, and
   should be used for traffic which has that requirement.

1.2.1.2 Rate Queues

   Similarly, a rate-based queuing system is a combination of a set of
   queues and a scheduler that empties each at a specified rate.  An
   example of a rate based queuing system is a road intersection with a
   stoplight - the stoplight acts as a scheduler, giving each lane a
   certain opportunity to pass traffic through the intersection.

   In a rate-based queuing system, such as WFQ [27][26] or WRR [28], the
   delay that a packet in any given queue will experience is dependant
   on the parameters and occupancy of its queue and the parameters and
   occupancy of the queues it is competing with.  A queue whose traffic
   arrival rate is much less than the rate at which it lets traffic
   depart will tend to be empty, and packets in it will experience
   nominal delays.  A packet whose arrival rate approximates or exceeds
   its departure rate will tend to be full, and packets in it will
   experience greater delay.  Such a scheduler can impose a minimum
   rate, a maximum rate, or both, on any queue it touches.

1.2.2 Active Queue Management

   "Active queue management" or AQM is a generic name for any of a
   variety of procedures that use packet dropping or marking to manage
   the depth of a queue.  The canonical example of such a procedure is



Baker                   Expires January 20, 2003                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                  Document                       July 2002


   Random Early Detection [25], in which a queue is assigned a minimum
   and maximum threshold, and the queuing algorithm maintains a moving
   average of the queue depth.  While the mean queue depth exceeds the
   maximum threshold, all arriving traffic is dropped.  While the mean
   queue depth exceeds the minimum threshold but not the maximum
   threshold, a randomly selected subset of arriving traffic is marked
   or dropped.  This marking or dropping of traffic is intended to
   communicate with the sending system, causing its congestion avoidance
   algorithms to kick in.  As a result of this behavior, it is
   reasonable to expect that TCP's cyclic behavior is desynchronized,
   and the mean queue depth (and therefore delay) should normally
   approximate the minimum threshold.

   A variation of the algorithm is applied in Assured Forwarding [11],
   in which the behavior aggregate consists of traffic with multiple
   DSCP marks, which are intermingled in a common queue.  Different
   minima and maxima are configured for the several DSCPs separately,
   such that traffic which exceeds a stated rate at ingress is more
   likely to be dropped or marked than traffic which was within its
   contracted rate.

1.2.3 Conditioning of traffic

   Additionally, at the first router in a network that a packet crosses,
   arriving traffic may be measured, and dropped or marked according to
   a policy, or perhaps shaped on network ingress as in [23].  This may
   be used to bias feedback loops, such as is done in Assured Forwarding
   [11], or to limit the amount of traffic in a system, as is done in
   Expedited Forwarding [19].  Such measurement procedures are
   collectively referred to as "traffic conditioners".

1.2.4 Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP)

   The DSCP is a number in the range 0..63, which is placed into an IP
   packet to mark it according to the class of traffic it belongs in.
   Half of these values are earmarked for standardized services, and
   half of them are available for local definition.

1.2.5 Per Hop Behavior (PHB)

   In the end, the facilities just described are combined to form a
   specified set of characteristics for handling different kinds of
   traffic, depending on the needs of the application.  This document
   seeks to identify useful traffic aggregates and specify what PHB
   should be applied to them.

1.3 Key Service concepts

   While Differentiated Services is a general architecture that may be
   used to implement a variety of services, three fundamental services
   have been defined and characterized for general use.  These are basic
   service for elastic traffic, the Assured Forwarding service, and the
   Expedited Forwarding service for real-time (inelastic) traffic.

   The terms "elastic" and "real-time" are defined in RFC 1633 [2]
   section 3.1, as a way of understanding broad brush application
   requirements.  This document should be reviewed to obtain a broad
   understanding of the issues in quality of service, just as RFC 2475
   [8] should be reviewed to understand the data plane architecture used
   in today's Internet.

1.3.1 Best Effort Service

   The basic services applied to any class of traffic are those
   described in [7] and [6].  Best Effort Service may be summarized as
   "I will accept your packets", with no further guarantees.  Packets in
   transit may be lost, reordered, duplicated, or delayed at random.
   Generally, networks are engineered to limit this behavior, but
   changing traffic loads can push any network into such a state.

   Application traffic in the internet is expected to be "elastic" in
   nature.  By this, we mean that the receiver will detect loss or
   variation in delay in the network and provide feedback such that the
   sender adjusts its transmission rate to approximate available
   capacity.

   For basic best effort service classes, we provide a single DSCP value
   to identify the traffic, a queue or class to store it, and active
   queue management to protect the network from it and to limit delays.
   The interesting thing is that by giving that queue a higher minimum
   rate than its measured arrival rate, we can effectively limit the
   deleterious effects of congestion on a given class of traffic,
   transfering them to another class that is perhaps better able to
   absorb the impact or is considered to be of lower value to the
   network administration.  So, for example, if it is important to
   service database exchange or transaction traffic in a timely fashion,
   isolating the traffic into a queue and giving it a relatively high
   minimum rate will accomplish that.

1.3.2 Assured Forwarding (AF)

   The Assured Forwarding [11] service is explicitly modeled on Frame
   Relay's DE flag or ATM's CLP capability, and is intended for networks
   which (as those do) offer average-rate SLAs.  This is an enhanced

Internet-Draft                  Document                       July 2002


   Best Effort service; traffic is expected to be "elastic" in nature.
   By this, we mean that the receiver will detect loss or variation in
   delay in the network and provide feedback such that the sender
   adjusts its transmission rate to approximate available capacity.

   For such classes, we provide a multiple DSCP values (two or three,
   perhaps more using local values) to identify the traffic, a common
   queue or class to store the aggregate, and active queue management to
   protect the network from it and to limit delays.  We meter traffic as
   it enters the network, and traffic is variously marked depending on
   the arrival rate of the aggregate.  The premise is that it is normal
   for users to occasionally use more capacity than their contract
   stipulates, perhaps up to some bound.  However, if traffic must be
   lost or marked to manage the queue, this excess traffic will be
   marked or lost first.

1.3.3 Expedited Forwarding (EF)

   Expedited Forwarding [19] was originally proposed as a way to
   implement a virtual wire, and can be used in such a manner.  It is an
   enhanced best effort service: traffic remains subject to loss due to
   line errors and reordering during routing changes.  However, using
   queuing techniques, the probability of delay or variation in delay is
   minimized.  For this reason, it is generally used as the way to carry
   voice, and perhaps video.  Voice and video are inelastic "real-time"
   applications - they send packets at the rate the codec produces them,
   regardless of availability of capacity.  As such, this service has
   the potential to disrupt or congest a network if not controlled.  It
   also has the potential for abuse.

   To protect the network, at minimum one must police traffic at various
   points to ensure that the design of a queue is not over-run, and then
   the traffic must be given a low delay queue (often using priority,
   although it is asserted that a rate-based queue can do this) to
   ensure that variation in delay is not an issue, to meet application
   needs.

   There is controversy regarding the place of signaling.  Call
   Admission Control, including call refusal when policy thresholds are
   crossed, can assure high quality communication by ensuring the
   availability of bandwidth to carry a load.  For this purpose, RSVP
   [4][13] was designed.  However, there is concern with the scalability
   [5] of that solution, and in large networks, aggregation [15] of
   sessions is appropriate.

2. Specified Traffic Classes

    Figure A shows eleven classes of traffic that are commonly specified
   in enterprise networks or on access links.  It is not mandatory to
   configure any of them; common experience is that a small subset is
   useful in any given network configuration.  This specification
   recommends that if such a service is deployed, it be deployed in a
   manner consistent with this table.

   Figure A: Summary of specified Differentiated Services classes

2.1 Voice on IP

   The voice traffic class serves RTP voice.  It is specified in [19].

   The fundamental service offered to voice traffic is best effort
   service up to a specified upper bound with nominal delay.  Operation
   is in some respects similar to an ATM CBR VC.  The ATM VC is
   guaranteed its bandwidth, and if it stays within the negotiated rate
   it experiences nominal loss and delay.  EF traffic has a similar
   guarantee.

   Typical configurations negotiate the use of Voice on IP using
   protocols such as SIP and RSVP.  When a user has been authorized to
   send voice traffic, this admission procedure has verified that data
   rates will be within the capacity of the network that it will use.
   Since RTP voice does not respond to loss or marking in any
   substantive way, the network must police at ingress to ensure that
   the voice traffic stays within its negotiated bounds.  Having thus
   assured a predictable input rate, the network may use a priority
   queue to ensure nominal delay and variation in delay.

   When used to give preferential service, the preferred systems or
   sessions must be authenticated during the process of resource
   assignment [12][22][16][17].  They may be given preferential access
   in whatever manner is appropriate.

2.2 File Transfer Service

   The File Transfer traffic class serves applications which run over
   TCP [1] or a transport with a consistent congestion avoidance
   procedure [9][10], and normally drive as high a data rate as they can
   obtain over a long period of time.  The FTP protocol is a common
   example, although one cannot definitively say that all FTP transfers
   are moving data in bulk.  The PHB is specified in [11].

   The fundamental service offered to file transfer traffic is best
   effort service with a specified minimum rate.  One must assume that
   this class will consume any available capacity, and on congested
   links may experience queuing delay or loss.

   Typical configurations use Explicit Congestion Notification [14] or
   random loss to implement active queue management [6], and may impose
   a minimum or maximum rate.  In queues, the probability of loss of
   AF11 traffic may not exceed the probability of loss of AF12 traffic,
   which in turn may not exceed the probability of loss of AF13 traffic.
   Ingress traffic conditioning passes traffic in the class up to some
   specified threshold marked AF11, additional traffic up to some
   secondary threshold marked as AF12, and potentially passes additional
   traffic marked AF13.  In such a case, if one network customer is
   driving significant excess and another seeks to use the link, any
   losses will be experienced by the high rate user, causing him to
   reduce his rate.

   When used to give preferential service, the preferred systems or
   sessions must be authenticated, and ingress policing increases the
   drop or mark probability of any authorized traffic, it must increase
   the drop or mark probability of all unauthorized traffic.

2.3 Human-response Applications

   The human response traffic class serves applications which run over
   TCP [1]  or a transport with a consistent congestion avoidance
   procedure [9][10], and serve transaction, database access, or
   interactive protocols.  Such applications might include telnet,
   common ERP applications, instant messaging, or other applications,
   which hold a user waiting until they respond.  The PHB is specified
   in [11].

   The fundamental service offered to human response traffic is best
   effort service with a specified minimum rate.  The rate should be
   specified significantly in excess of actual measured rates, in order
   to ensure that this traffic experiences only nominal delay or loss.

   Typical configurations use Explicit Congestion Notification [14] or

   random loss to implement active queue management [6], and may impose
   a minimum or maximum rate.  In queues, the probability of loss of
   AF21 traffic may not exceed the probability of loss of AF22 traffic,
   which in turn may not exceed the probability of loss of AF23 traffic.

   When used to give preferential service, the preferred systems or
   sessions must be authenticated, and ingress policing increases the
   drop or mark probability of any authorized traffic, it must increase
   the drop or mark probability of all unauthorized traffic.

2.4 Mission Specific and Critical Applications

   The mission-specific traffic class serves applications which run over
   TCP [1]  or a transport with a consistent congestion avoidance
   procedure [9][10], and serve needs the network administrator deems to
   need special support.  For example, in a banking network, it might
   support electronic banking protocols.  The PHB is specified in [11].

   The fundamental service offered to mission critical traffic is best
   effort service with a specified minimum rate.  The rate should be
   specified significantly in excess of actual measured rates, in order
   to ensure that this traffic experiences only nominal delay or loss.

   Typical configurations use Explicit Congestion Notification [14] or
   random loss to implement active queue management [6], and may impose
   a minimum or maximum rate.  In queues, the probability of loss of
   AF31 traffic may not exceed the probability of loss of AF32 traffic,
   which in turn may not exceed the probability of loss of AF33 traffic.

   When used to give preferential service, the preferred systems or
   sessions must be authenticated, and ingress policing increases the
   drop or mark probability of any authorized traffic, it must increase
   the drop or mark probability of all unauthorized traffic.

2.5 Network Multimedia (video)

   The Network Multimedia traffic class serves applications that carry
   RTP data streams whose rate has been negotiated with the network
   using a protocol such as RSVP [4].  If the mean rate is conceived as
   Bc/frame interval and the difference between the mean and peak rate
   is Be/frame interval, the first Bc packets in a frame are marked
   AF41, the next Be packets are marked AF42, and any additional packets
   may be summarily dropped, or marked AF43 and subjected to loss in any
   but a queue of nominal depth.  This PHB is specified in [11].

   The fundamental service offered to network multimedia traffic is best
   effort service with controlled rate and delay.  This traffic does not
   respond to loss or marking, and can be severely compromise by loss or

   delays that exceed its framing interval.  It can be assumed, however,
   to have been initially transmitted in a manner roughly comparable to
   [23].  As such, active queue management [6] serves primarily to deal
   with extreme cases; ingress traffic conditioning is depended on to
   ensure rate compliance.  In queues, the probability of loss of AF41
   traffic may not exceed the probability of loss of AF42 traffic, which
   in turn may not exceed the probability of loss of AF43 traffic if
   any.

   When used to give preferential service, the preferred systems or
   sessions must be authenticated during the process of resource
   assignment [12][22][16][17].  They may be given preferential access
   in whatever manner is appropriate.

2.6 IP Routing Protocols

   The IP Routing traffic class serves IP Routing Applications such as
   BGP or OSPF.  It is specified in [7].

   The fundamental service offered to routing traffic is best effort
   service with minimal loss, even at the cost of delays on the order of
   tens to hundreds of milliseconds.  By placing it into a separate
   queue or class to minimize loss, the routing it supports is helped to
   converge.

   Typical configurations use Explicit Congestion Notification [14] or
   random loss to implement active queue management [6], and may impose
   a minimum or maximum rate.

   Preferential access is undefined for this traffic class.

2.7 Streaming Video

   The streaming video traffic class serves applications like Windows
   Media Player or RealAudio.  These may use standard or proprietary
   bulk transfer protocols, using TCP as a transport or application-
   specific transports built on UDP, for buffering prior to playout.
   The service model is specified in [7].

   The fundamental service offered to streaming video is best effort
   service.  By placing it into a separate queue or class, it may be
   ensured minima or maxima consistent with a specific service level
   agreement.

   Typical configurations use Explicit Congestion Notification [14] or
   random loss to implement active queue management [6], and may impose
   a minimum or maximum rate.

   Preferential access is undefined for this traffic class.

2.8 Telephony Signaling

   The Telephony Signaling traffic class serves network control
   applications like SIP and H.245/H.225  when used to route Voice on
   IP, Video on IP, and related applications.  It is specified in [7].

   The fundamental service offered to Telephony Signaling traffic is
   best effort service with minimize loss.  The reason for this is to
   maximize the speed of such routing, and avoid the poor user
   experience that results from loss of control traffic.  By placing it
   into a separate queue or class, it may be ensured minima or maxima
   consistent with a specific service level agreement.

   Typical configurations use Explicit Congestion Notification [14] or
   random loss to implement active queue management [6], and may impose
   a minimum or maximum rate.  The AQM parameters are specified in such
   a manner as to permit relatively deep queues to form temporarily.

   Preferential access is undefined for this traffic class.

2.9 Network Management

   The management traffic class serves applications that are necessary
   to manage the network, such as SNMP servers, but which implement no
   congestion avoidance procedure.  It is specified in [7].

   The fundamental service offered to the network traffic class is best
   effort service with minimization of loss.  By placing it into a
   separate queue or class, it may be ensured minima or maxima
   consistent with a specific service level agreement.

   Typical configurations use random loss to implement active queue
   management [6], to maximize the utility of network management
   applications while protecting the network in the event of an
   overload.

   Preferential access is undefined for this traffic class.

2.10 Scavenger class

   The scavenger traffic class serves applications which run over TCP
   [1]  or a transport with a consistent congestion avoidance procedure
   [9][10], and which the user is willing to accept service without
   guarantees.  It is specified in [20].

   The fundamental service offered to the scavenger traffic class is

   best effort service.  By placing it into a separate queue or class,
   it may be treated in a manner consistent with a specific service
   level agreement.

   Typical configurations use Explicit Congestion Notification [14] or
   random loss to implement active queue management [6].  It generally
   does not impose a minimum or maximum rate, although it could.

   Preferential access is undefined for this traffic class.

2.11 Default traffic class

   The default traffic class serves applications which have not been
   otherwise specified, but which run over TCP [1]  or a transport with
   a consistent congestion avoidance procedure [9][10].  It is specified
   in [7].

   The fundamental service offered to the default traffic class is best
   effort service with active queue management to limit over-all delay.
   By placing it into a separate queue or class, it may be ensured
   minima or maxima consistent with a specific service level agreement.

   Typical configurations use Explicit Congestion Notification [14] or
   random loss to implement active queue management [6], and may impose
   a minimum or maximum rate on the queue.

   Preferential access is undefined for this traffic class.

3. Security Considerations

   This document discusses policy, and describes a common policy
   configuration, for the use of a Differentiated Services Code Point by
   transports and applications.  If implemented as described, it should
   ask the network to do nothing that the network has not already
   allowed.  If that is the case, no new security issues should arise
   from the use of such a policy.

   It is possible, however, for the policy to be applied incorrectly, or
   for another policy to be applied, which would be incorrect in the
   network.  In that case, a policy issue exists which the network must
   detect, assess, and deal with.  This is a known security issue in any
   network dependent on policy-directed behavior.

   A well-known flaw applies when bandwidth is reserved or enabled for a
   service (for example, voice transport) and another service or an
   attacking traffic stream uses it.  This possibility is inherent in
   diffserv technology, which depends on appropriate packet markings.
   When bandwidth reservation or a priority queuing system is used in a
   vulnerable network, the use of a scheme such as RSVP Policy Marking
   [12] and RSVP Identity [16] is important.  To the author's knowledge,
   there is no technical way to respond to an unauthenticated data
   stream using service that it is not intended to use, and such is the
   nature of the Internet.
