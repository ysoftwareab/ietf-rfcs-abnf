Abstract

   The DTNRG research group has defined many protocols such as Bundle
   Protocol and Licklider.  The specifications of these protocols
   contain fields that are subject to a registry.  For the purpose of
   its research work, the group created adhoc registries[DTNRGREG].  As
   the specifications are stable and have multiple interoperable
   implementations, the group would like to handoff the registries to
   IANA for official custidy.  This document describes the actions
   needed to be executed by IANA.

Internet-Draft             DTN IANA Registries                March 2010


1.  Introduction

   The DTNRG research group has defined many protocols[RFC4838] such as
   Bundle Protocol[RFC5050] and Licklider[RFC5326].  The specifications
   of these protocols contain fields that are subject to a registry.
   For the purpose of its research work, the group created adhoc
   registries[DTNRGREG].  As the specifications are stable and have
   multiple interoperable implementations, the group would like to
   handoff the registries to IANA for official custidy.  This document
   describes the actions needed to be executed by IANA.


2.  Bundle Protocol

   The Bundle Protocol(BP)[RFC5050] has fields requiring a registry
   managed by IANA.

2.1.  Bundle Block Types

   The Bundle Protocol has a Bundle Block Type code field (section
   4.5.2) [RFC5050].  An IANA registry shall be setup as follows.

   The registration policy for this registry is:
      0-191: Specification Required
      192-255: Private or experimental use.  No assignment by IANA.

   The Value range is: unsigned 8 bit integer.

   RG TBD: decide registration policy.  RFC5326 says 6-255 is
   "reserved". does that mean no new assignment, or "unassigned"?
