1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   It describes managed objects used for monitoring locks on a device,
   in particular, acquired or released by NETCONF and COPS-PR entities.

   The Network Configuration Protocol defined in RFC4741[RFC4741]
   provides mechanisms to install, manipulate, and delete the
   configuration of network devices.  It provides global lock mechanism
   via <lock> and <unlock> operations for allowing only one session at a
   time to make a change to a managed device.  However,
   [draft-ietf-netconf-partial-lock] defines partial lock mechanism as a
   capability to extend base NETCONF for allowing multiple sessions to
   be able to modify the configuration of a managed device in parallel.

   COPS usage for Policy Provisioning (COPS-PR) defined in RFC 3084
   [RFC3084]provides mechanisms and conventions used to communicate
   provisioned information (QoS, Security policy,etc.) between PEPs and
   PDPs.  Between PEP and PDP, there is a single connection per Client-
   Type for a given area of policy (e.g., QoS)so at a given time there
   must be only one server updates a particular policy configuration.
   Such a policy configuration is effectively locked.

   Locks via many NM protocols may co-exist on a single device, and
   impact operations whatever NM protocols are used.  This MIB module is
   expected to be used to monitor all these locks in a consistent way.

   The primary purpose of this MIB module is to allow operators to
   monitor all locks supported by a manged device and understand how
   they might be impacting the operations of the device and the network.
   A customer might be using applications that manage a particular type
   of functionality, e.g., those applications might use SNMP to
   configure firewalls, but an operator applying a Netconf lock to the
   firewall might prevent SNMP from configuring the firewall.  We want
   to make it possible for the operator to determine why the firewall is
   not getting configured on a timely basis.

   Now this MIB module only contains managed objects for generic locks
   and specific NETCONF and COPS-PR locks.  If a device wants to support
   any other specific locks, this module SHALL be extended to contain
   more appropriate objects.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC3410[RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD
   58[RFC2578], STD 59[RFC2579] and STD 60[RFC2580].

3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119].

4.  Overview

   The primary purpose of this mib module is to allow operators to
   monitor locks and understand how they might be impacting the
   operations of the device and the network.  With such a MIB module,
   SNMP could be used to monitor locks set by NETCONF, COPS-PR (or any
   other protocols).

   It will be useful for a SNMP operator to retrieve particular
   information of active locks before sending SET request.  If there is
   any lock that intersects the requested objects, the operator could
   know how the SET request would be impacted by locks, e.g., the SET
   request would be delayed or denied by locks.

   A SNMP manager should not be permitted to access locked objects.  If
   the device detects a SET request attempting to access locked objects,
   it should probably response an error to the operator letting him know
   that the SET request could not be completed because certain network
   management entity has locked the relevant resources.  The error type
   should be "resource unavailable (13)"[RFC3416].

4.1.  lockTable

   There is generic information for all locks via any network management
   protocol. lockTable, which contains entries for all locks, includes
   generic information of locks such as the protocol by which a lock is
   acquired, the principal who own a lock, and duration a lock lasts,
   etc.  This table exists on devices that can be managed and configured
   via SNMP, NETCONF, COPS-PR or any other protocols.

   This mib module also defines an object named
   lockNMInterfacesSupported to indicate which NM interface locks are
   monitored.  For example, if there is no COPS-PR lock in lockTable, it
   may due to COPS-PR protocol is not supported, COPS-PR locks are not

Internet-Draft    Definitions of MOs for lock via NMps        April 2009


   monitored or no active COPS-PR locks at all.  With this indicator, an
   operator can understand the situation better.

4.2.  Specific NM interface lock Table

   Now two NM interface locks monitoring are modeled.  There might be
   more tables for any other specific NM interface locks monitoring in
   the future.

   This lockNetconfTable provides specific information on each lock
   instance set by Netconf NM interface in lockTable.

   The lockCopsPrTable provides specific information on each lock
   instance set by COPS-PR NM interface in lockTable.

4.2.1.  lockNetconfTable

   The lockNetconfTable represents the specific information of locks via
   NETCONF, including the session ID who own a lock, the lock ID, the
   datastore affected (running/candidate/startup/etc.), and the scope of
   the lock, etc.

   There is an object named lockNetconfModified for indicating the
   candidate datastore is modified or not.  It is useful to have the
   flag for modified/unmodified status of the locked objects.  Once
   locked, it remains unmodified until somebody changes the data.  Once
   committed, it is clean again.  This could be useful information for
   somebody considering unlock by force.

   lockNetconfModified flag could also be useful for an operator to
   understand that a device is in the process of active maintenance (its
   config is likely to change soon).  For example, if the lock owner is
   authorized to make such changes, the operator can probably ignore
   SNMP interface up/down traps if there is an active lock on the
   interface configurations.  Also a security manager might take
   interest when security configuration information is being modified.

4.2.2.  lockCopsPrTable

   The lockCopsPrTable represents the specific information of locks via
   COPS-PR, including the area of the policy provisioning identified by
   the client-type, policies being installed, policies being removed and
   policies being updated, etc.

   There is an object named lockCopsPrModified for indicating the policy
   is modified or not.  It is a useful flag as described in the
   lockNetconfModified object.

4.3.  Statistics

   This mib module defines 2 statistic objects to keep track of the
   number of active locks and failed locks, respectively.

   SNMP applications could retrieve the values of these counters
   periodically to detect unusual events occurring.  These statistic
   objects can help to warn about anomalous behavior.

   If the number of active locks grows rapidly or there are locks
   lasting for a long period of time, a security problem would be
   encountered, e.g., somebody would be trying to launch a denial of
   service attack.  Keeping track of the number of active locks can help
   to uncover this behavior.

   If the number of lock failures is unusual, an attacker might be
   trying to lock things they are not authorized to, or somebody is
   attempting applying locks to different portions of datastore to see
   what they could get.  The counter for lockFailures could help uncover
   this behavior.

4.4.  MIB References

   The following MIB module has IMPORTS from RFC2578[RFC2578],
   RFC2579[RFC2579], RFC2580[RFC2580], RFC3411[RFC3411].  In REFERENCE
   clauses, it also refers to RFC2748[RFC2748],RFC4741[RFC4741] and
   [draft-ietf-netconf-partial-lock].

6.  Security Considerations

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this
   MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an
   intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB
   module via direct SNMP SET operations.

   The readable objects in this MIB module are not sensitive.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate

   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

7.  IANA Considerations

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:



                 Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
                 ----------        -----------------------
                  lockMIB              { mib-2 XXX }


   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
   requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and
   to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.

   Many thanks to David Harrington for his guidance and feedback on this
   MIB module.
