     2.  Abstract

     Over  the  years,  as  Internet  services  have evolved, sophisticated
     inter-domain applications such as roaming,  voice  over  IP,  Internet
     fax,  and  QoS  provisioning  have  arisen.   This  document discusses
     whether accounting for these services services  can  be  reliably  and
     securely  accomplished  using established techniques, and explores the
     requirements for Internet-scale Accounting Management.

     4.  Introduction

     Over the years,  as  Internet  services  have  evolved,  sophisticated
     inter-domain  applications  such  as  roaming, voice over IP, Internet
     fax, and  QoS  provisioning  have  arisen.   This  document  discusses
     whether  accounting  for  these  services services can be reliably and
     securely accomplished using established techniques, and  explores  the
     requirements for Internet-scale Accounting Management.


     4.1.  Terminology

     This document frequently uses the following terms:

     Accounting
               The  act of collecting information on resource usage for the
               purpose of trend analysis, auditing, billing, or cost  allo-
               cation.

     Rating    The  act of determining the price to be charged for use of a
               resource.

     Billing   The act of preparing an invoice.

     Auditing  The act of verifying the correctness of a procedure.

     Cost Allocation
               The act of allocating costs between entities. Note that cost
               allocation and rating are fundamentally different processes.

     Interim accounting
               An interim accounting packet provides a  snapshot  of  usage
               during  a  user's  session.  It  is typically implemented in
               order to provide for partial accounting of a user's  session
               in  the  event  of  a device reboot or other network problem
               that prevents the reception of a session summary  packet  or
               session record.

     Session record
               A  session  record represents a summary of the resource con-
               sumption of a user over the entire session. Accounting gate-
               ways  creating  the  session  record may do so by processing
               interim accounting events.

     Accounting Protocol
               A protocol used to convey data for accounting purposes.

     Intra-domain accounting
               Intra-domain accounting involves the collection of  informa-
               tion  on  resource  within an administrative domain, for use
               within that domain. In intra-domain  accounting,  accounting
               packets  and session records typically do not cross adminis-
               trative boundaries.




     Arkko                                                         [Page 3]





     INTERNET-DRAFT                                           6 August 1998


     Inter-domain accounting
               Inter-domain accounting involves the collection of  informa-
               tion  on  resource usage of an entity with an administrative
               domain, for use within  another  administrative  domain.  In
               inter-domain  accounting,  accounting  packets  and  session
               records will typically cross administrative boundaries.

     Real-time accounting
               Real-time accounting involves the processing of  information
               on  resource  usage  within a defined time window. Time con-
               straints are typically imposed in order to  limit  financial
               risk.


     4.2.  Requirements language

     In   this   document,  the  key  words  "MAY",  "MUST,   "MUST   NOT",
     "optional", "recommended",  "SHOULD",  and  "SHOULD  NOT", are  to  be
     interpreted as described in [24].


     5.  Flexibility properties of accounting systems

     This  document is concerned with understanding how a general mechanism
     can be used for the accounting management of  a  number  of  different
     applications.  It  is therefore appropriate that we examine the poten-
     tially differing requirements:


     Information    While there are some generally  applicable  information
                    elements  in  accounting (such as service name and time
                    information), different services typically have  widely
                    different needs to convey information.  It must be pos-
                    sible to extend the basic accounting mechanisms to  new
                    application areas in a well-defined manner.


     Security       An intra-domain trend analysis application has very low
                    or  non-existent  security   requirements;   hop-by-hop
                    integrity  support  is  almost certainly sufficient. In
                    contrast, an inter-domain billing application has  very
                    high   security   requirements   including  data-object
                    integrity through proxies, confidentiality, and so  on.


     Data amount    Many  applications  produce relatively small amounts of
                    data from each event, such as the few  dozen  variables
                    needed  to  describe  a  dial-in session with a NAS. In
                    contrast,  some  other  applications  may  require  the
                    inclusion  of  lengthy  public  key material and signa-
                    tures, or detailed descriptions of  the  provided  ser-
                    vice.





     Arkko                                                         [Page 4]





     INTERNET-DRAFT                                           6 August 1998


     Delay          Many  applications  don't require immediate delivery of
                    accounting information, and are unwilling  to  pay  the
                    price  of  such  fast  service.  Other  applications do
                    require  immediate  delivery.  Yet  other  applications
                    insist  also on fast acknowledgement of the delivery in
                    order to minimize the time the user has to wait  before
                    service can be provided.


     Applications  differ  also  much  depending on the amount of resources
     they can dedicate for the accounting tasks:


     CPU resources  An application such as the accounting of  dial-in  ses-
                    sions  of a NAS produces relatively infrequent account-
                    ing events. Other applications, such as accounting  the
                    browsing  of  a  web  page produce substantially higher
                    amounts of events.


     Storage resources
                    Many existing systems have no  non-volatile  memory  or
                    use  memory  types  that don't allow constant modifica-
                    tions.  In  contrast,  future  systems  are  likely  to
                    employ large and cheap non-volatile memories.


     Code size and complexity
                    For a workstation size computer the support of a number
                    of encryption algorithms, IPSec, MIME  encoding,  SMTP,
                    TCP, and so on is relatively easy. For a smaller device
                    such as an embedded processor in a fax or copy machine,
                    phone,  set  top  box, and so on there are much tighter
                    requirements  on  how  much  protocol  support  can  be
                    included.


     If possible, these differing requirements and constraints should still
     be supported within one accounting management mechanism.


     6.  Requirements



     6.1.  Flexibility

     The following flexibility requirements suggest themselves:


     Extensibility  The protocol MUST be extensible to  new  services.   It
                    MUST  be possible to define service-specific extensions
                    to the accounting protocol. There MUST be a possibility
                    to  define new standard and vendor-specific attributes.



     Arkko                                                         [Page 5]





     INTERNET-DRAFT                                           6 August 1998


                    There MUST be a possibility  to  define  new  messages.
                    There  MUST  be a possibility to detect version differ-
                    ences between protocol peers, and to  revert  to  least
                    common denominator behaviour.


     Security       It MUST be possible to use the accounting protocol both
                    in situations which need and tolerate  only  hop-by-hop
                    integrity  protection,  as  well as in situations which
                    need full integrity and confidentiality protection  for
                    data objects and hop-by-hop.


     Data amount    It MUST be possible to use the accounting protocol both
                    in situations in which the amount of transferred infor-
                    mation fits the MTU and in which it doesn't.


     Delay          It MUST be possible to use the accounting protocol both
                    when real-time transfer of information  is  needed  and
                    when it is not tolerated.


     Fast UDP Delivery
                    It MUST be possible to use the accounting protocol both
                    with TCP and UDP. UDP is needed when real-time require-
                    ments  dictate  that retransmission policies are speci-
                    fied in a different manner than what TCP  allows.   For
                    instance,  when  a critical service requests to send an
                    accounting record and expects  an  acknowledgement,  it
                    may  be  necessary  to switch to an alternate server if
                    the primary server does not respond to a  retransmitted
                    packet within a second.


     Storage        It MUST be possible to use the accounting protocol both
                    in devices which have a large non-volatile  memory  and
                    which don't.


     Code size      It  MUST be possible to have conforming accounting pro-
                    tocol implementations  from  a  stripped  down  version
                    which  includes  nothing more than basic protocol, UDP,
                    IP, and MD5 to a version which  includes  all  security
                    and transport protocol support.


     Proxy support  It MUST be possible to forward accounting protocol mes-
                    sages through proxies with all supported transfer  mod-
                    els.







     Arkko                                                         [Page 6]





     INTERNET-DRAFT                                           6 August 1998


     6.2.  Scalability

     The following scalability requirements are set:


     Per-device state
                    It MUST be possible to implement the accounting systems
                    with a per-device  state  when  real-time  requirements
                    don't call for event-driven information transfer.


     Amortize overhead
                    It  MUST  be possible to amortize the packet header and
                    security overhead over several accounting records  when
                    real-time  requirements  don't  call  for  event-driven
                    information transfer.


     6.3.  Security

     The following security related requirements are set:


     Data object integrity
                    Data object integrity MUST be  supported  even  through
                    proxies.


     Data object confidentiality
                    Data  object  confidentiality  MUST  be  supported even
                    through proxies.


     Hop-by-hop integrity
                    Hop-by-hop integrity MUST be supported.


     Hop-by-hop confidentiality
                    Hop-by-hop confidentiality MUST be supported.


     IPSec/TLS      Standard Internet security mechanisms such as IPSec  or
                    TLS  MUST  be  supportd for hop-by-hop security protec-
                    tion.


     Data-based access control
                    Access control MUST be based also on the  data  in  the
                    accounting  records  (such  as  for whose customers the
                    data is).







     Arkko                                                         [Page 7]





     INTERNET-DRAFT                                           6 August 1998


     6.4.  Accounting record transfer

     The following requirements are set  on  how  the  accounting  protocol
     allows records to be transferred.


     Polling        It MUST be possible to use the polling model.


     Event-driven   It MUST be possible to use the event-driven model.


     Event-driven polling
                    It  MUST  be  possible  to use the event-driven polling
                    model.


     Interim-accounting
                    It MUST be  possible  to  use  the  interim  accounting
                    model.


     Transfer negotiation
                    It  MUST  be  possible  for  the service device and the
                    accounting server to  negotiate  the  desired  transfer
                    model and interim accounting parameters.


     6.5.  Accounting record information

     The  following  requirements  are  related  to  the information in the
     accounting records transferred by the protocol:


     Finite sessions
                    The accounting protocol MUST support the accounting  of
                    service  usage  in  which a session begins at a certain
                    time and ends at a later time.


     Infinite sessions
                    The accounting protocol MUST support sessions of indef-
                    inite  length.  [Discussion: This requirement is set by
                    services which are turned on at one time such  as  when
                    you  order  for  some web space from a server, continue
                    for possibly a very long time, and might but  need  not
                    be terminated later.]


     Indivisible events
                    The  accounting protocol MUST support the accounting of
                    service usage which consists of an  indivisible  event.
                    [Discussion:  In theory, this could be simulated with a
                    start followed immediately by stop, perhaps even in the



     Arkko                                                         [Page 8]





     INTERNET-DRAFT                                           6 August 1998


                    same  packet.  However,  this is clumsy for a number of
                    services such as ordering a pizza.]


     Service naming The protocol MUST have a standard attribute which iden-
                    tifies  the  name of the provided service. [Discussion:
                    Should there be something to manage these  names,  e.g.
                    object identifiers?]


     Service amount specification
                    The protocol MUST have a standard attribute which gives
                    the "amount" of service provided. Amount is interpreted
                    in  an  service-specific  manner,  but  it could be the
                    amount of calls made, amount of pizzas  delivered,  and
                    so  on.  The  interpretation of the amount attribute is
                    defined in service-specific extensions to the  account-
                    ing  protocol.  It  MUST  be possible to represent also
                    real numbers and not just integers.


     Service length specification
                    The protocol MUST have a standard attribute which gives
                    the  "length" of the service provided. Length is inter-
                    preted in the same way for all services, and MUST  have
                    at least a one second granularity.


     Service parameter specification
                    The protocol MUST have a standard attribute which gives
                    parameter information about the provided  service.  The
                    interpretation  of  this parameter is service-specific,
                    and  defined  in  service-specific  extensions  to  the
                    accounting  protocol. [Discussion: Introduction of this
                    attribute may remove many  of  unnecessary  RFCs  about
                    video movie name attributes, pizza name attributes, and
                    so on.]

                    Note that the amount of money used for the  service  is
                    NOT required to be within the standard attributes.


     7.  Analysis of current protocols

     In  the following table we analyze how RADIUS Accounting as defined in
     [4], TACACS+ as defined in [32], SNMP v3 as defined in [12]-[16], SMTP
     and  EDI functionality described in [17]-[23], and DIAMETER as defined
     in [33] - [35] compare. We have used the  following  notation  in  the
     table:


     NO        The protocol does not and can not support the feature.

     YES       The protocol supports the feature.

     CAN       The basic protocol could support the feature, given a simple
               appropriate extension such as a new attribute is defined.

     8.  Conclusions

     As noted above, RADIUS, TACACS+, and DIAMETER accounting are  suitable
     for  use  in  low-delay applications, SMTP is well suited for applica-
     tions requiring high security and efficient transfer, and implementing
     non-volatile  storage, and SNMP v3 is suitable for use in intra-domain



     Arkko                                                        [Page 10]





     INTERNET-DRAFT                                           6 August 1998


     accounting applications without need for data  object  security.  How-
     ever,  since  no  single  protocol  satisfies all the requirements, we
     believe that the need for a special-purpose accounting protocol arises
     in the situations that involve more than one of the following require-
     ments:

     - Accounting applications which require low processing delay in  order
     to  detect  security or appropriate use violations in progress, manage
     credit risk or prevent  fraud.  In  such  applications,  it  is  often
     required  that  accounting-data  be handled in an event-driven manner,
     and sent in small batches.

     - Accounting applications which must incorporate information from many
     devices  or transfer very large volumes of data. In such applications,
     efficiency is very important.

     - Light-weight accounting applications running on small devices.

     While RADIUS and TACACS+ are in  principle  capable  of  handling  the
     above  two requirements, the lack of data object security, extensibil-
     ity, and support for large record sizes makes it hard use these proto-
     cols.

     The following decisions now await resolving:

     -  The  first  decision  is  whether to handle credit risk management,
     fraud detection, and so as  a  part  of  an  accounting  protocol,  or
     whether  to  handle it as a part of yet to be defined resource manage-
     ment protocol. Support for these tasks could be included  in  products
     that  use  the  DIAMETER  resource  management  extensions  [34],  for
     instance. If the resource management protocol is used for this purpose
     then  many  of the requirements set in this document will apply to it.
     If not, a separate protocol needs to be constructed for the accounting
     part. [Discussion: The line between a resource management and account-
     ing tasks is blurred in my mind - what IS the actual difference?]

     - The second decision is to decide  whether  the  support  for  large-
     voleme or light-weight applications is important enough to warrant the
     definition of a new protocol.

     - The third decision is to decide  whether  the  accounting  work  may
     assume  the universal existence of large non-volatile memories or not.
