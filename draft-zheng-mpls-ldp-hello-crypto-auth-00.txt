1. Introduction 

   The Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) [RFC 5036] utilizes LDP 
   sessions that run between LDP peers. The peers may be directly 
   connected at the link level or may be remote. A label switching 
   router (LSR) that speaks LDP may be configured with the identity of 
   its peers or may discover them using the LDP Hello message sent 
   encapsulated in UDP that may be addressed to "all routers on this 
   subnet" or to a specific IP address. Periodic Hello messages are 
   also used to maintain the relationship between LDP peers necessary 
   to keep the LDP session active.

Internet-Draft LDP Hello Cryptographic Authentication     October 2010 
    

   Unlike all other LDP messages, the Hello messages are sent using UDP 
   not TCP. This means that they cannot benefit from the security 
   mechanisms available with TCP. [RFC5036] does not provide any 
   security mechanisms for use with Hello messages except to note that 
   some configuration may help protect against bogus discovery events. 

   Spoofing a Hello packet for an existing adjacency can cause the 
   valid adjacency to time out and in turn can result in termination of 
   the associated session. This can occur when the spoofed Hello 
   specifies a smaller Hold Time, causing the receiver to expect Hellos 
   within this smaller interval, while the true neighbor continues 
   sending Hellos at the previously agreed lower frequency. Spoofing a 
   Hello packet can also cause the LDP session to be terminated 
   directly, which can occur when the spoofed Hello specifies a 
   different Transport Address, other than the previously agreed one 
   between neighbors. Spoofed Hello messages is observed and reported 
   as real problem in production networks. 

   As described in [RFC5036], the threat of spoofed Basic Hellos can be 
   reduced by accepting Basic Hellos only on interfaces to which LSRs 
   that can be trusted, and ignoring Basic Hellos not addressed to the 
   "all routers on this subnet" multicast group. Spoofing attacks via 
   Extended Hellos are potentially more serious threat. An LSR can 
   reduce the threat of spoofed Extended Hellos by filtering them and 
   accepting only those originating at sources permitted by an access 
   list. However, performing the filtering using access lists requires 
   LSR resource, and the LSR is still vulnerable to the IP source 
   address spoofing. 

   This document introduces a new Cryptographic Authentication TLV 
   which is used in LDP Hello message as an optional parameter. It 
   enhances the authentication mechanism for LDP by securing the Hello 
   message against spoofing attack, and an LSR can be configured to 
   only accept Hello messages from specific peers when authentication 
   is in use. 

   Using this Cryptographic Authentication TLV, one or more secret keys 
   (with corresponding key IDs) are configured in each system. For each 
   LDP Hello packet, the key is used to generate and verify a "message 
   digest" or "message hash" that is stored in the LDP Hello packet. A 
   sequence number is also carried in each packet to help avoid replay 
   attacks.

2. Cryptographic Authentication TLV 

2.1. Optional Parameter for Hello Message 

   [RFC5036] defines the encoding for the Hello message. Each Hello 
   message contains zero or more Optional Parameters, each encoded as a 
   TLV. Three Optional Parameters are defined by [RFC5036]: 

    

         Optional Parameter               Type 
        -------------------------------  -------- 
         IPv4 Transport Address           0x0401 
         Configuration Sequence Number    0x0402 
         IPv6 Transport Address           0x0403 
    

   This document defines a new Optional Parameter: the Cryptographic 
   Authentication parameter. The Cryptographic Authentication TLV 
   Encoding is described in section 2.2.

      2 - Keyed SHA1 
      3 - Meticulous Keyed SHA1 
      4 - Keyed SHA-256

      6 - Keyed SHA-512 
      7-255 - Reserved for future use 
   (TBD by IANA) 

   - Auth Key ID: The authentication key ID in use for this packet.  
      This allows one or more keys to be active simultaneously. 

   - Reserved: MUST be set to zero on transmit, and ignored on receipt. 

   - Sequence Number: The sequence number for this packet, providing 
      protection against replay attacks. The value is incremented 
      occasionally. For Meticulous Keyed MD5 and Meticulous Keyed SHA1 
      Authentication, this value is incremented for each successive 
      packet transmitted for a session. 

   - Auth Key/Digest/Hash:  

     This field carries the MD5/SHA1/SHA2 key digest/hash for the packet. 
     The length of the Auth Key/Digest/Hash varies based on the 
     cryptographic algorithm used, which is shown as below:  

         Auth type               Length 
        ----------------------  ---------- 
         Keyed MD5              16 bytes 
         Meticulous Keyed MD5   16 bytes 
         Keyed SHA1             20 bytes 
         Meticulous Keyed SHA1  20 bytes 
         Keyed SHA-256          32 bytes 
         Keyed SHA-384          48 bytes 
         Keyed SHA-512          64 bytes 
             
     When calculating the digest/hash, the shared key is stored in this 
     field, padding with trailing zeros if needed. 

3. Processing Hello Message Using Cryptographic Authentication 

   The Cryptographic Authentication mechanisms described in this draft 
   are very similar to those used in other protocols. One or more 
   secret keys (with corresponding key IDs) are configured in each 
 
 
Zheng, et al.           Expires April 8, 2011                 [Page 5] 

Internet-Draft LDP Hello Cryptographic Authentication     October 2010 
    

   system. One of the keys is included in a digest or a hash calculated 
   over the outgoing LDP Hello packet, but the Key itself is not 
   carried in the packet.  

   A sequence number is also carried in each packet to help avoid 
   replay attacks. The sequence number may be incremented in a circular 
   fashion. For most of the authentication scheme in use, the sequence 
   number is occasionally incremented (The decision as to when to 
   increment the sequence number is implementation dependent and 
   outside the scope of this document). Specifically, for Meticulous 
   Keyed MD5 and Meticulous Keyed SHA1, the sequence number is 
   incremented on every packet. 

    

3.1. Transmission Using Cryptographic Authentication 

   Prior to transmitting Hello message, the Auth Type field is set to 
   indicate the authentication type in use. The Auth Key ID field is 
   set to the ID of the current authentication key. The Sequence Number 
   field is set, possibly having been incremented from the last message 
   sent according to the scheme in place. The authentication key is 
   placed into the Auth Key/Digest field, padding with trailing zeros 
   as necessary, for digest/hash calculation. 

   An MD5 digest or a SHA1/SHA2 hash is calculated over the entire LDP 
   Hello packet. The resulting digest/hash is stored in the Auth 
   Key/Digest/Hash field prior to transmission. The secret key is 
   replaced by the digest/hash, and MUST NOT be carried in the packet. 

    

3.2. Receipt Using Cryptographic Authentication 

   The receiving LSR applies acceptability criteria for received Hellos 
   using cryptographic authentication. If the Cryptographic 
   Authentication TLV is unknown to the receiving LSR, the received 
   packet MUST be discarded according to Section 3.5.1.2.2 of [RFC5036]. 

   If the Cryptographic Authentication TLV in a received Hello packet 
   does not contain a known and acceptable Auth Type value, then the 
   received packet MUST be discarded. If the Auth Key ID field does not 
   match the ID of a configured authentication key, the received packet 
   MUST be discarded. 



 
 
Zheng, et al.           Expires April 8, 2011                 [Page 6] 

Internet-Draft LDP Hello Cryptographic Authentication     October 2010 
    

   For most of the authentication scheme in use, if the received 
   sequence number lies outside of the range of last sequence number 
   received to last sequence number received +(Hello Hold Time/Hello 
   Interval) inclusive, the received packet MUST be discarded. 
   Specifically, for Meticulous Keyed MD5 and Meticulous Keyed SHA1, if 
   the received sequence number lies outside of the range of last 
   sequence number received+1 to last sequence number received +(Hello 
   Hold Time/Hello Interval) inclusive, the received packet MUST be 
   discarded. 

   The receiving LSR replaces the contents of the Auth Key/Digest/Hash 
   field with the authentication key specified by the received Auth Key 
   ID field. If the MD5 digest or SHA1/SHA2 hash of the entire LDP 
   Hello packet is equal to the received value of the Auth 
   Key/Digest/Hash field, the received packet is accepted for other 
   normal checks and processing as described in [RFC5036]. Otherwise, 
   the received packet MUST be discarded. 

    

4. Security Considerations 

   Section 1 of this document describes the security issues arising 
   from the use of unsecured LDP Hello messages. In order to combat 
   those issues, it is RECOMMENDED that all deployments use the 
   Cryptographic Authentication TLV to secure the Hello message. 

   The quality of the security provided by the Cryptographic    
   Authentication TLV depends completely on the strength of the    
   cryptographic algorithm in use, the strength of the key being used, 
   and the correct implementation of the security mechanism in 
   communicating LDP implementations. Also, the level of security 
   provided by the Cryptographic Authentication TLV varies based on the 
   authentication type used. 

    

5. IANA Considerations 

   IANA maintains a registry of LDP message parameters with a sub-
   registry to track LDP TLV Types. This document request IANA to 
   assign a new TLV Types as follows: 

   TLV                           Type 

   Cryptographic Authentication  0x0404 (TBD)

Internet-Draft LDP Hello Cryptographic Authentication     October 2010 
    

   This document also request IANA to assign a new registry titled "LDP 
   Hello Authentication Type", its recommended values as follows: 

         Value   LDP Hello Authentication Type Name 
        -------  ----------------------------------- 
           0      Keyed MD5 
           1      Meticulous Keyed MD5 
           2      Keyed SHA1 
           3      Meticulous Keyed SHA1 
           4      Keyed SHA-256 
           5      Keyed SHA-384 
           6      Keyed SHA-512 
         7-255    Unassigned 
   (TBD)
