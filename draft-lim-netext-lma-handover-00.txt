   and restrictions with respect to this document.

Abstract

   This document describes a mechanism for context transfer between
   Local Mobility Anchors (LMAs) in a large Proxy MIPv6 domain to
   provide the IP ongoing session continuity of mobile nodes. In order
   to enhance the performance of the LMA handover, a bi-directional
   tunnel between a previous LMA and a new target LMA is established.

1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   
2.  Introduction

   The Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) [RFC5213] domain refers to the network
   where the mobility management of a Mobile Node (MN) is handled using
   the Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol. The Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain includes
   Local Mobility Anchors (LMAs) and Mobile Access Gateways (MAGs).
   This document describes a mechanism to provide the ongoing session
   continuity to a MN during the handover from one LMA to another LMA
   in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain.

   This specification addresses the following problems: 

   o  Who and when to trigger the LMA handover.
   o  Who and how to select a new target LMA.
   o  How to transfer the context information between LMAs.
   o  Database table updates of network entities.
   o  Other considerations.

   When a previous MAG and a new MAG share the same LMA, the previous
   MAG transfers the context information of a MN to the new MAG via the
   bi-directional tunnel between them by using the Fast Handovers for
   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PFMIPv6) [PFMIPv6] protocol. This document
   provides a mechanism for transferring the context information of a MN
   from a Previous LMA (PLMA) to a new LMA (NLMA) by establishing a
   bi-directional tunnel.

  
3.  Terminology

   This document reuses the terminology from [RFC5213], [RFC3775] and
   [PFMIPv6]. The following terms and abbreviations are additionally
   used in this document.
   
   Boundary Mobile Access Gateway (bMAG):
      The MAG that has connections from more than one LMA. The bMAG
      decides when it tiggers the LMA handover and requests a previous
      LMA to initiate the LMA handover.
        
   Previous Local Mobility Anchor (PLMA):
      It is the topological anchor point for the MN's home network
      prefix(es) and is the entity that manages the MN's binding state.

      Figure 1: Reference network for the LMA handover

      
      The PLMA initiates to hand over the IP mobility session and
      forwards the context information of a MN to the target LMA. 
      The PLMA has the functional capabilities of the home agent as
      defined in Mobile IPv6 base specification [RFC3775]. 
        
   New Local Mobility Anchor (NLMA):
      The LMA that receives the context information of a MN from PLMA
      and maintains the current location of the MN. The NLMA has the
      functional capabilities of the foreign agent as defined in Mobile
      IPv6 base specification [RFC3775]. 


4.  LMA Handovers for PMIPv6 Overview

   To deliver the context information of a MN from a PLMA to a NLMA
   efficiently, a LMA Handover Request (LMA_HO_Req) and a LMA Handover
   Response (LMA_HO_Resp) messages are exchanged between a bMAG and
   a PLMA. In the messages, MN'Identifier (MN ID), MN Link-layer
   Identifier (MN-LL-ID) and MN's Home Network Prefix (MN-HNP) are
   included.

   In this document, the policy profile of a MN stored in the remote
   policy store is extended to include the address of the LMA at which
   the MN is currently located (Foreign Agent LMAA: FA LMAA) as well as
   the MN ID, the address of the LMA which acts as the home agent of
   the MN (Home Agent LMAA: HA LMAA).
 
   The reference network is illustrated in Figure 1.


4.1.  Protocol Operation

   The sequence of events illustrating the LMA handover is shown in 
   Figure 2.
   
   The detailed description is as follows:

   (a)  The MN detects a new link and reports the identifications of 
        itself (MN ID) and the access point (New AP ID) to which the MN 
        is most likely to move.

   (b)  The access network (AN), to which the MN is currently attached,
        indicates the movement of the MN to the bMAG. This step is
        defined in [PFMIPv6].
    
   (c)  The bMAG sends a LMA_HO_Req message to the PLMA to initiate the
        LMA handover.

   (d)  The PLMA selects the NLMA and sends a LMA_HO_Init message with
        the context information of the MN to the NLMA. The PLMA is
        assumed to maintain the information on the other LMAs in the
        same PMIPv6 domain, such as the message exchanges between LMAs,
        the external information input and the reception of the
        information from the AAA/Policy store. However, this is out of
        the scope of this document.
    
   (e)  The NLMA received the LMA_HO_Init message creates a bind cache
        entry (BCE) of the corresponding MN and, then, a bi-directional
        tunnel is set up between the PLMA and the NLMA by sending
        a LMA_HAck message to the PLMA.
    
   (f)  The PLMA notifies bMAG of the completion of the context transfer
        regarding the MN from the PLMA to the NLMA by sending a 
        LMA_HO_Resp message to the bMAG.
     
   (g)  The bMAG initiates the tunne setup between the bMAG and the NLMA
        by sending a Proxy Binding Update (PBU) message to the NLMA.

   (h)  The NLMA sends an Update message to the remote policy store to
        inform the policy store of the fact that the NLMA is the new LMA
        maintaining the MN's current location information and the
        binding information.

   (i)  The remote policy store sends an Update_Ack message to the NLMA
        in order to let the NLMA know that the FA LMAA of the MN in the
        policy store is set to the NLMA.
    
   (j)  The bi-directional tunnel between the bMAG and the NLMA is
        completely established by the NLMA's sending a Proxy Binding
        Acknowledgement (PBA) message to the bMAG.
     
   (k)  The data downloaded from the correspondent node (CN) arrives at
        the PLMA which is the home agent LMA of the MN, and the PLMA
        forwards the downloaded data to the NLMA through the tunnel
        between them. Then, the NLMA sends the data to the MN via the
        bMAG. For the efficiency of the data delivery, it is possible
        to consider the route optimization additionally.

   (l)  The data uploaded from the MN to the CN are delivered to the CN
        via the bMAG and the NLMA in that order.



5.  Other Considerations

   Security issues for this document follow those for PMIPv6 [RFC5213]
   and PFMIPv6 [PFMIPv6]. In PMIPv6, the MAG and LMA are assumed to
   share security associations. In PFMIPv6, the MAGs are assumed to 
   share security associations. This document also assumes that the LMAs 
   that participate in handover have adequate prior agreement and trust 
   relationship between each other.
   
   A MN can be multi-homed. Multi-homing issues for this document follow 
   that for [LMA_Redirect]. A single LMA entity should have the control
   over all possible multi-homed mobility sessions the MN has. All
   mobility sessions that a multi-homed MN may have SHOULD be anchored
   in the single LMA entity.
