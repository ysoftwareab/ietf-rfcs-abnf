Abstract 

   This document describes a framework comprised of few scenarios and 
   associated requirements where PW redundancy is needed. A set of 
   redundant PWs is configured between PE nodes in SS-PW applications, 
   or between T-PE nodes in MS-PW applications. In order for the PE/T-PE 
   nodes to indicate the preferred PW path to forward to one another, a 
   new status is needed to indicate the preferential forwarding status 
   of active or standby for each PW in the redundancy set.

1. Terminology  

   o  PW Terminating Provider Edge (T-PE). A PE where the customer-   
      facing attachment circuits (ACs) are bound to a PW forwarder. A   
      Terminating PE is present in the first and last segments of a MS-
      PW. This incorporates the functionality of a PE as defined in 
      RFC3985 [3]. 

   o  Single-Segment Pseudo Wire (SS-PW). A PW setup directly between 
      two T-PE devices. Each PW in one direction of a SS-PW traverses 
      one PSN tunnel that connects the two T-PEs.  

   o  Multi-Segment Pseudo Wire (MS-PW). A static or dynamically 
      configured set of two or more contiguous PW segments that behave 
      and function as a single point-to-point PW. Each end of a MS-PW 
      by definition MUST terminate on a T-PE. 

   o  PW Segment. A part of a single-segment or multi-segment PW, which 
      is set up between two PE devices, T-PEs and/or S-PEs. 

   o  PW Switching Provider Edge (S-PE). A PE capable of switching the 
      control and data planes of the preceding and succeeding PW 
      segments in a MS-PW. The S-PE terminates the PSN tunnels of the 
      preceding and succeeding segments of the MS-PW. 

   o  PW switching point for a MS-PW. A PW Switching Point is never the 
      S-PE and the T-PE for the same MS-PW. A PW switching point runs 
      necessary protocols to setup and manage PW segments with other PW 
      switching points and terminating PEs 

   o  Active PW.  A PW whose preferential status is set to Active and 
      Operational status is UP.  

   o  Standby PW. A PW whose preferential status is set to Standby and 
      Operational status is UP.

   o  Primary Path. The configured path which is preferred when 
      revertive protection switching is used. 

   o  Secondary Path.  One or more configured paths that are used by 
      protection switching when current active PW path enters 
      Operational DOWN state. 

   o  Revertive protection switching. Traffic will be carried by 
      primary path if it is Operationally UP and the wait-to-restore 
      timer expires and primary path is made the Active PW. 

   o  Non-revertive protection switching. Traffic will be carried by 
      the last PW path selected as a result of previous active path 
      entering Operationally DOWN state.   

   o  Manual selection of PW path. Ability for the operator to manually 
      select the primary/secondary paths.    

    

  

2. Introduction 

   In single-segment PW (SS-PW) applications, protection for the PW is 
   provided by the PSN layer. This may be an RSVP LSP with a FRR backup 
   and/or an end-to-end backup LSP. There are applications however where 
   the backup PW terminates on a different target PE node. PSN 
   protection mechanisms cannot protect against failure of the target PE 
   node or the failure of the remote AC.  

   In multi-segment PW (MS-PW) applications, a primary and one or more 
   secondary PWs in standby mode are configured in the network. The 
   paths of these PWs are diverse in the sense that they are switched at 
   different S-PE nodes. In these applications, PW redundancy is 
   important for the service resilience.  

       In some deployments, it is important for operators that 
   particular PW is preferred if it is available. For example, PW path 
   with least latency may be preferred.   

   This document describes framework for these applications and its 
   associated operational requirements. The framework comprises of new 
   required status called preferential status to PW apart from the 
   operational status already defined in the PWE3 control protocol [2]. 
   The definition and operation of the preferential status is covered in 
   ref.[7]

   Figure 1  Multiple Multi-homed CEs with single SS-PW redundancy  

   In the Figure 1 illustrated above both CEs, CE1 and CE2 are dual- 
   homed with PEs, PE1, PE2 and PE3, PE4 respectively. The method for 
   dual-homing and the used protocols such as Multi-chassis Link 
   Aggregation Group (MC-LAG) are outside the scope of this document.  
   Note that the PSN tunnels are not shown in this figure for clarity. 
   However, it can be assumed that each of the PWs shown is encapsulated 
   in a separate PSN tunnel. 

          PE1 has PW1 and PW4 service connecting PE3 and PE4 
   respectively. Similarly PE2 has PW2 and Pw3 pseudo wire service 
   connecting PE4 and PE3 respectively. PW1, PW2, PW3 and PW4 are all 
   operationally UP. In order to support N:1 or 1:1 only one PW is 
   required to be selected to forward the traffic. Thus the PW needs to 
   reflect his new status apart from the operational status. We call 
   this as preferential forwarding status with state representing 
   'active' the one carrying traffic while the other 'standby' which is 
   operationally UP but not forwarding traffic. The method of deriving 
   Active/Standby status of the AC is outside the scope of this

   document. In case of MC-LAG it is derived by the Link Aggregation 
   Control protocol (LACP) negotiation.    

   A new algorithm needs to be developed using the preferential 
   forwarding state of PW and select only one PW to forward.  

                  On failure of AC between the dual homed CE1 in this 
   case lets say PE1 the preferential status on PE2 needs to be changed. 
   Different mechanisms/protocols can be used to achieve this and these 
   are beyond the scope of this document. For example the MC-LAG control 
   protocol changes the link status on PE2 to active. After the change 
   in status the algorithm for selection of PW needs to revaluate and 
   select PW to forward the traffic. 

   In this application, because each dual-homing algorithm running on 
   the two node sets, i.e., {CE1, PE1, PE2} and {CE2, PE3, PE4}, selects 
   the active AC independently, there is a need to signal the active 
   status of the AC such that the PE nodes can select a common active PW 
   path for end-to-end forwarding between CE1 and CE2. This helps in 
   restricting the changes occurring on one side of network due to 
   failure to the other side of the network.  Note this method also 
   protects against any single PE failure or some dual PE failures. 

                 One Multi-homed CE with single SS-PW redundancy 
   application is a subset of above. Only PW1 and PW3 exist in this 
   case. This helps against AC failure and PE failure of dual homed AC. 
   Similar requirements applies in usage MS-PW redundancy as well. An 
   additional requirement applicable to MS-PW is forwarding of status 
   notification through S-PE. In general from customer view, SS-PW and 
   MS-PW has similar resiliency requirement. 

   There is also a 1:1 protection switching case that is a subset of the 
   above where PW3 and PW4 are not present and the CEs do not perform 
   native service protection switching, but instead may use load 
   balancing. This protects against AC failures and can use the native 
   service to indicate active/failed state.  

      If each CE homes to different PEs, then the CEs can implement 
   native service protection switching, without any PW redundancy 
   functions. All that the PW needs to do is detect AC, PE, or PSN 
   tunnel failures and convey that information to both PEs at the end of 
   the PW. This is applicable to MS-PW as well. 

3.2. Single Homed CE with MS-PW redundancy 

   This is the main application of interest and the network setup is 
   shown in Figure 2

   Figure 2 Single homed CE with multi-segment pseudo-wire redundancy 

   In Figure 2, CE1 is connected to PE1 in provider Edge 1 and CE2 to 
   PE2 in provider edge 2 respectively. There are three segmented PWs. A  
   PW1, is switched at S-PE1, PW2, which is switched at S-PE2 and PW3, 
   is switched at S-PE3. 

                   Since there is no multi-homing running on the AC, the 
   T-PE nodes would advertise 'Active' for the forwarding status based 
   on the priority. Priorities associate meaning of 'primary PW' and 
   'secondary PW'. These priorities MUST be used in revertive mode as 
   well and paths must be switched accordingly. The priority can be 
   configuration or derivation from the PWid. Lower the PWid higher the 
   priority. However, this does not guarantee that paths of the PW are 
   synchronized because for example of mismatch of the configuration of 
   the PW priority in each T-PE. The intent of this application is to 
   have T-PE1 and T-PE2 synchronize the transmit and receive paths of 
   the PW over the network. In other words, both T-PE nodes are required 
   to transmit over the PW segment which is switched by the same S-PE. 
   This is desirable for ease of operation and troubleshooting.

               Figure 3  Multi-homed MTU-s in H-VPLS core                   

   In Figure 3, MTU-s is dual homed to PE1 and PE2 and has spoke PWs to 
   each of them. MTU-s needs to choose only one of the spoke PW (active 
   PW) to one of the PE to forward the traffic and the other to standby 
   status. MTU-s can derive the status of the PWs based on local policy 
   configuration. PE1 and PE2 are connected to H-VPLS core on the other 
   side of network. MTU-s communicates the status of its member PWs for 
   a set of VSIs having common status Active/Standby. Here MTU-s 
   controls the selection of PWs to forward the traffic. Signaling  
   using PW grouping with common group-id in PWid FEC Element or 
   Grouping TLV in Generalized PWid FEC Element as defined in [2] to PE1 
   and PE2 respectively, is encouraged to scale better.   

                      Whenever MTU-s performs a switchover, it needs to 
   communicate to PE2-rs for the Standby PW group the changed status of 
   active. 

                   In this scenario, PE devices are aware of switchovers 
   at MTU-s and could generate MAC Withdraw Messages to trigger MAC 
   flushing within the H-VPLS full mesh. By default, MTU-s devices 
   should still trigger MAC Withdraw messages as currently defined in 
   [5] to prevent two copies of MAC withdraws to be sent (one by MTU-s 
   and another one by PEs). Mechanisms to disable MAC Withdraw trigger 
   in certain devices is out of the scope of this document.

3.4. PW redundancy between n-PEs  

   Following figure illustrates the application of use of PW redundancy 
   for dual homed connectivity between PE devices in a ring topology.

             +-------+                     +-------+        

             |  PE3  |=====================|  PE4  |==... 

             +-------+    PW Group 2       +-------+ 

                 Figure 4   Redundancy in Ring topology                

   In Figure 4, PE1 and PE3 from VPLS domain A are connected to PE2 and 
   PE4 in VPLS domain B via PW group 1 and group 2. Each of the PE in 
   respective domain is connected to each other as well to form the ring 
   topology. Such scenarios may arise in inter-domain H-VPLS deployments 
   where RSTP or other mechanisms may be used to maintain loop free 
   connectivity of PW groups. 

                Ref.[5] outlines about multi-domain VPLS service without 
   specifying how redundant border PEs per domain per VPLS instance can 
   be supported. In the example above, PW group1 may be blocked at PE1 
   by RSTP and it is desirable to block the group at PE2 by virtue of 
   exchanging the PW preferential status as Standby. How the PW grouping 
   should be done here is again deployment specific and is out of scope 
   of the solution.

                         Figure 5 Bridge Module Model 

   In Figure 5, two provider access networks, each having two n-PEs, 
   where the n-PEs are connected via a full mesh of PWs for a given VPLS 
   instance. As shown in the figure, only one n-PE in each access 
   network is serving as a Primary PE (P) for that VPLS instance and the 
   other n-PE is serving as the backup PE (B).In this figure, each 
   primary PE has two active PWs originating from it. Therefore, when a 
   multicast, broadcast, and unknown unicast frame arrives at the 
   primary n-PE from the access network side, the n-PE replicates the 
   frame over both PWs in the core even though it only needs to send the 
   frames over a single PW (shown with == in the figure) to the primary 
   n-PE on the other side. This is an unnecessary replication of the 
   customer frames that consumes core-network bandwidth (half of the 
   frames get discarded at the receiving n-PE). This issue gets 
   aggravated when there is three or more n-PEs per provider, access 
   network. For example if there are three n-PEs or four n-PEs per 
   access network, then 67% or 75% of core-BW for multicast, broadcast 
   and unknown unicast are respectively wasted.

                      In this scenario, Standby PW signaling defined in 
   [7] can be used among n-PEs that can disseminate the status of PWs 
   (active or blocked) among themselves and furthermore to have it tied 
   up with the redundancy mechanism such that per VPLS instance the 
   status of active/backup n-PE gets reflected on the corresponding PWs 
   emanating from that n-PE. 

4. Generic PW redundancy requirements 

4.1. Protection switching requirements 

   o  Protection architecture such as N:1,1:1 or 1+1 can be used. N:1 
      protection case is somewhat inefficient in terms of capacity 
      consumption hence implementations SHOULD support this method 
      while  1:1 being subset and efficient MUST be supported. 1+1 
      protection architecture can be supported but is left for further 
      study. 

   o  Non-revertive mode MUST be supported, while revertive mode is an 
      optional one.  

   o  Protection switchover can be operator driven like Manual 
      lockout/force switchover or due to signal failure. Both methods 
      MUST be supported and signal failure MUST be given higher 
      priority than any local or far end request. 

4.2.  Operational requirements 

   o  (T-)PEs involved in protecting a PW SHOULD automatically discover 
      and attempt to resolve inconsistencies in the configuration of 
      primary/secondary PW.  

   o  (T-)PEs involved in protecting a PW SHOULD automatically discover 
      and attempt to resolve inconsistencies in the configuration of 
      revertive/non-revertive protection switching mode.   

   o  (T-)PEs that do not automatically discover or resolve 
      inconsistencies in the configuration of primary/secondary, 
      revertive/non-revertive, or other parameters MUST generate an 
      alarm upon detection of an inconsistent configuration.  

   o  (T-)PEs involved with protection switching MUST support the 
      configuration of revertive or non-revertive protection switching 
      mode. 

   o  (T-)PEs involved with protection switching SHOULD support the 
      local invocation of protection switching.

   o  (T-)PEs involved with protection switching SHOULD support the 
      local invocation of a lockout of protection switching.   

   o  In standby status PW can still receive packets in order to avoid 
      black holing of in-flight packets during switchover. However in 
      case of use of VPLS application packets are dropped in standby 
      status except for the OAM packets.   

    

5. Security Considerations  

   This document expects extensions to LDP that are needed for 
   protecting pseudo-wires. It will have the same security properties as 
   in LDP [4] and the PW control protocol [2].
