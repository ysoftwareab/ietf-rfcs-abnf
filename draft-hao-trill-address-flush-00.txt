                     TRILL: Address Flush Protocol
                 <draft-hao-trill-address-flush-00.txt>


Abstract

   The TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) protocol, by
   default, learns end station addresses from observing the data plane.
   This document specifies an optional message by which an originating
   TRILL switch can explicitly flush addresses learned by other TRILL
   switches through the egress of data ingress by that originating TRILL
   switch. This is a supplement to the TRILL automatic address
   forgetting and can assist in achieving more rapid convergence.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                    Address Flush Protocol


1. Introduction

   Edge TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links [RFC6325])
   switches, also called RBridges, by default learn end station MAC
   addresses from observing the data plane. On receipt of a native frame
   from an end station, they would learn the local MAC address
   attachment of the source end station. And on egressing
   (decapsulating) a remotely originated TRILL Data frame, they learn
   the remote MAC address and remote attachment TRILL switch. Such
   learning is all appropriately scoped by data label (VLAN or Fine
   Grained Label [RFC7172]).

   TRILL has mechanisms for timing out such learning and appropriately
   clearing it based on some network connectivity changes; however,
   there are circumstances under which it would be helpful for a TRILL
   switch to be able to explicitly flush (clear) learned end station
   reachability information to achieve more rapid convergence (see, for
   example, Section 6.2 of [RFC4762]). Obivously a TRILL switch R1 can
   easily flush any locally learned addresses it wants. This document
   specifies an optional message to request flushing such learned
   address information at remote TRILL switches. This Address Flush
   message makes use of the RBridge Channel facility [RFC7178], which
   supports typed message transmission between RBridges.



1.1 Terminology and Acronyms

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document uses the terms and acronyms defined in [RFC6325] and
   [RFCchannel] as well as the following:

      AFN - Address Family Number ([RFC4760] where it is called Address
         Family Identifier (AFI)).

      FGL - Fine Grained Label [RFC7172].

      Management VLAN - A VLAN in which all TRILL switches in a campus
         indicate interest so that multi-destinaiton TRILL Data packets,
         including RBridge Channel messages [RFCchannel], sent with that
         VLAN as the Inner.VLAN will be delivered to all TRILL switches
         in the campus. Usually no end station service is offered in the
         Management VLAN.

      RBridge - A alterntive name for a TRILL switch.

      TRILL switch - A device implementing the TRILL protocol.

2. Address Flush Message Details

   The Address Flush message makes use of the RBridge Channel protocol
   [RFC7178].

   Although initial use is expected to be to flush 48-bit MAC addresses
   [RFC7042], the protocol accommodates flushing other types of end
   station addresses; there have been suggestion for TRILL switches to
   learn IP addresses from the data plane [INFOCOM], TRILL might be
   extended to accommodate 64-bit MAC addresses, or similar future
   extensions might benefit from the ability to flush other types of
   learned addresses.

   The general structure of an RBridge Channel packet on a link between
   TRILL switches is shown in Figure 1 below. The type of RBridge
   Channel packet is given by a Protocol field in the RBridge Channel
   Header that indicates how to interpret the Channel Protocol Specific
   Payload [RFC7178l].

                Figure 1. RBridge Channel Packet Structure

   An Address Flush RBridge Channel message normally applies to
   addresses within the VLAN or FGL [RFC7178] Data Label in the TRILL
   Header.  Address Flush protocol messages are usually sent as multi-
   destination packets (TRILL Header M bit equal to one) so as to reach
   all TRILL switches offering end station service in the VLAN or FGL
   specified by the Data Label. However, and address flush protocol
   message can be sent unicast, if it is desired to clear addresses at
   one TRILL switch only. And there are provisions for indicating the
   Data Label with the address(es) to be flushed for cases where the
   address flush protocol message is sent over a Managagement VLAN or
   the like.

             Figure 2. Address Flush Channel Message Structure

   The fields in Figure 2 related to the Address Flush message are as
   follows:

      Channel Protocol:  The RBridge Channel Protocol value allocated
         for Address Flush (see Section 3).

      SF: The 2-bit SF ("super flush") field values have the following
         meanings:

         0: No special effect.

         1: All addresses learned at the receiving TRILL switch due to
            egressing TRILL Data packets fror the TRILL switch
            originating this Address Flush message are flushed for the
            data label in the TRILL Header. Any ADDRESS RECORDs in the
            rest of the message for that data label can be ignored but
            there may be ADDRESS RECORDs present that apply to other
            data labels.

         2: All addresses learned at the receiving TRILL switch due to
            egressing TRILL Data packets from the TRILL switch
            originating this Address Flush message are flushed across
            all data labels. The remainder of the Address Flush message,
            including the value of K, are ignored.

         3: Reserved. Ignored on receipt.

      RESV: 4 reserved flag bits. Must be sent as zero and ignored on
         recipet.

      K: The number of ADDRESS RECORDs present. See below.

      The structure of the ADDRESSES RECORD is as follows:

                   Figure 3. Structure of ADDRESSES RECORD


         L: Label present. If this bit is a one, the optional Data Label
            shown in present. If it is zero, there is no data label and
            the addresses listed are withing the data labe given in the
            TRILL Header.

            N: No Specific Addresses. If this bit is one and Count is
            zero and L is one, then flush all addresses learned at the
            receiving TRILL switch due to egressing TRILL Data packets
            from the TRILL switch originating this Address Flush message
            are flushed for the Data Label given in the ADDRESS RECORD.
            If this bit is zero or Count is non-zero or L is zero, they
            this special flush action is not performed.

         R: A reserved bit that MUST be sent as zero and is ignored on
            receipt.

         Size: The size of each Address in bytes. The presence of this
            field makes it possible for a receiving TRILL switch to skip
            an ADDRESS RECORD even if it does not understand the value
            in the AFN field.  Size MUST NOT be zero; a zero size field
            indicates a corrupt Addresses Flush message and the entire
            message is ignored. MUST be the correct size for an Address

            of the type indicated by the AFN field, for example 6 for
            48-bit MAC addresses. If these conditions are violated, the
            Address Flush message is discarded.

         Count: The number of occurrences of an Address to flush in this
            ADDRESS RECORD. May be zero. All Addresses MUST fit within
            the RBridge Channel Message. If they do not, the message is
            discarded.

         AFN:  The Address Family Number for the type of addresses
            present as assigned by IANA. (The AFN for 48-bit MAC
            addresses is 0x4005.)

         Data Label: An optional Data Label (VLAN or FGL) in the same
            format as Data Labels that appear in the TRILL Header.
            Included in an ADDRESS RECORD only if the L bit is a one.

         Address: An instance of an address to be flushed.

3. IANA Considerations

   IANA has allocated tbd1 for the Address Flush RBridge Channel
   Protocol number from the range of RBridge Channel protocols allocated
   by Standards Action [RFC7178].



4. Security Considerations

   The Address Flush RBridge Channel Protocol provides no security
   assurances or features. However, use of the Address Flush protocol
   can be nested inside the RBridge Channel Tunnel Protocol [RFCtunnel]
   using the RBridge Channel message payload type. The Channel Tunnel
   protocol can provide some security services.

   See [RFC7178] for general RBridge Channel Security Considerations.

   See [RFC6325] for general TRILL Security Considerations.
