Abstract

   This document discusses the problem and requirement of the
   communication between mobile access router.  With the evolution of
   mobile communication, mobile wirless access point will not only using
   IP for transporation, but also has much more function to support
   mobile communication such as self organization/optimization network,
   flat network archtiecture, multiple connections and distributed
   network architecture et al .

1.  Introduction

   while more and more mobile operators are thinking that IP function
   will not only be used for transporation by mobile access network, it
   could also undertake more tasks such as self organization/
   optimization network, multiple connections, IP mobility management,
   and distributed IP access network.

   There are several distributed wireless IP access network scenarios
   may implement inter mobile access router protocol such as self
   organization network, mesh, and structured P2P based mobile IP access
   network.

   In the current mobile operator's network, they have to spend huge
   resource for test drive during mobile network deployment and
   optimization, which consist of major part of CAPEX and OPEX.  With
   the potential requirement of multiple connections of wireless
   communications and distributed IP access network, IP communications
   between mobile access routers could help to reduce the CAPEX and
   OPEX, for example this communication could realize an alternative way
   of conventional drive test and configuration which need a huge man
   power performaning and only get a snapshop result.

2.  Scenarios of implementing inter mobile access router protocols

   There are two scenarios implementing inter mobile access router
   protocols, one is distributed mobile IP access network, the other is
   half distributed mobile IP access network for the sake of self
   organization and configuration. .

2.1.  Distributed Mobile IP Access Network

   Recent development of distributed network has bring several benefit
   to industry such as less investment and simple network
   infrastructure.

   The distributed IP Mobile Access Network is shown in the figure
   below:


                                     +-----+
                                     | AGW |
                                     +-----+
                                        |
                      v              v  |           v
                      |              |  |           |
                      +-----+        +-----+        +-----+
                      | MAR |........| MAR |........| MAR |
                      +-----+        +-----+        +-----+
               v       ,':                            :   `.   v
               |     ,'  :                            :    `.  |
               +-----+   :                            :  +-----+
               | MAR |   :                            :  | MAR |
               +-----+   :                            :  +-----+
                     `.  :  v              v        v :    ,'
                      `. :  |              |        | :  ,'
                      +-----+        +-----+        +-----+
                      | MAR |........| MAR |........| MAR |
                      +-----+        +-----+        +-----+


   The scenario of the above could be wireless mesh network and
   structured P2P wireless network architecture.  After bringing into
   P2P function into each mobile access router and each mobile access
   router has multiple wireless radios.  One is specifically for mobile
   terminal access, others could be used for communication with other
   mobile access router.  Under such direction, several purpose of inter
   access router protocol could be realized in the Internet level, we
   are going to illustrate it in the next section.

2.2.  Half Distributed Mobile IP Access Network

   Centralized distributed network still cover major deployment in the
   current network, based on this network architecture, self
   organization/optimization become possible after development of inter
   mobile access router protocol.

   The half distributed IP mobile access network is shown in the figure
   below:

            v                   v        |         v                   v
            |                   |        |         |                   |
            +-----+             +-----+  |   +-----+             +-----+

      | MAR |....... | MAR |-------------+-----------| MAR |.....| MAR |

          `.v       ,'      `.    : v         v      ,'     `.      ,'v
           `|     ,'          `.  : |         |    ,'         `.  ,'  |
            +-----+           +-----+         +-----+           +-----+
            | MAR |...........| MAR |         | MAR |...........| MAR |
            +-----+           +-----+         +-----+           +-----+
                                        v      ,'
                                        |    ,'
                                        +-----+
                                        | MAR |
                                        +-----+


   This scenario has two distributed mobile access network domain, the
   core mobile access router is connected with each other and could be
   connected to access gateway, and several mobile access router could
   work as relay mobile router.  Based on this scenario, zero network
   configuration could be done based on inter access router IP protocol.
   As well self organization/optimization network would prefer to be
   implemented based on this.

3.  Implementations of the Protocol

   Current organization and optimization is based on low-level interface
   and per-device basis, it lacks scalability and testability in real
   time operational mobile network.

3.1.  Plug in Play Configuration

   Mobile network require zero configuration of new mobile IP access
   router where Plug and Play could realize based on Internet protocol.
   Which could save huge of human resource for test drive and manual
   opeartions.

3.2.  Self Organization/Optimization Network

   The time and cost of deploying, configuring and operating networks,
   is expected to increase even further due to the exponential growth in
   numbers of network elements in the Internet,especially mobile
   networks such as mobile access router.  The increasing complication
   and dynamic nature of many mobile networks make configuration more
   complex and further mandate continuous adaptation and validation of
   active configurations in real-time.

   To Achieve the characterstical like real time, adaptive, flexibity,
   we need not only engineering principles for automated configuration,
   but also standardized inter mobile IP access router protocol.  The
   ultimate goals are to support future large-scale mobile networks that
   will self-organize/optimize, dynamically adapt to external events and
   allow for low-cost operation.

5.  Security Considerations

   Mobile inter access router protocol do require IPsec based protection
   mechanism, IKE could be used for neogiation IPsec tunnel between
   mobile access routers.

   router protocol which could support self organziation and
