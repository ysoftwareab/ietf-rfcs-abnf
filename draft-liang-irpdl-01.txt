Abstract 
    
   This document specifies an information retrieval protocol for digital 
   library. This protocol has two parts: standard search Webservice, 
   which defines the format of query words and the search results; a 
   method to find and select such search Webservice. By using this 
   protocol, all the databases including web page database, digital 
   issue database, and video database, can release the uniform search 
   Webservice, though these databases may have different metadata 
   standards and architectures. And these Webservice can be easily found 
   and visited by search systems. This very protocol makes it possible 
   that users can obtain all kinds of information on the Internet in

1. Introduction 
 
   Hundreds of databases have been introduced in many libraries, and 
   there are many more free information resources on the Internet. It 
   has become a kind of acrobatics for us to find the complete and 
   precise results about our query in so many databases. Everyone hopes 
   to obtain all kinds of information in one search engine, such as web 
   pages, Videos, but does not care where the information lies in. 
   Webservice [4] give us a good method to realize this desire. As long 
   as these databases can provide Webservice, it will be an easy mission 
   to integrate all kinds of information resources in one search engine. 
   Now Google [5] and some other databases have provided search 
   Webservice. But standard protocol for these searches Webservice does 
   not exist. Even different web search engines?Webservice have 
   distinct formats of queries and search results, needless to mention

   the Webservice of many other kinds of databases. Thus, a uniform 
   Webservice applicable for all the information resources and an 
   efficient method to find such Webservice should be established. This 
   memo just achieves these two goals. The protocol comprises of two 
   interacting parts, Standard Search Webservice (SSW) which can be 
   applied to all databases and Search Webservice Description, Discovery 
   and Integration (SDDI) which provides an efficient way to find the 
   appropriate search Webservice. 
 
2 Standard Searches Webservice 
    
   Standard Searches Webservice defines a standard search Webservice 
   with its classes and functions. Most of databases can distribute the 
   uniform search Webservice by using this definition. 
 
2.1 data encoding 
 
   In order to support searching documents in multiple languages, all 
   requests and responses should be in accordance with the UTF-8 
   encoding. 
    
2.2. The format of query words 
 
   The query words specify attribute based boolean queries. Different 
   communities will require their own sets of attributes, so these query 
   words is flexible enough to allow attributes from different 
   communities. 
    
   There are three kinds of query words : basicQuery, advancedQuery, 
   fullQuery. The XML Schema of query word is as follow. 
    
   The three logical operators are defined as follow. 
    
   <xsd:simpleType name="logops"> 
   <xsd:restriction base="xsd:string"> 
   <xsd:enumeration value="AND"> 
   <xsd:enumeration value="NOT"> 
   <xsd:enumeration value="OR"> 
   </xsd:restriction> 
   </xsd:simpleType> 
    
   The other operator for string operation is defined as follow. 
   Operator "equal" provides simple equality matching on property values.  
   "contain" means searching the documents that contain the special 
   words. 
    
   <xsd:simpleType name="operator"> 
   <xsd:restriction base="xsd:string"> 
   <xsd:enumeration value="contain"> 
 
 
WANG,et al               Expires - April 2004                 [Page 3] 
Internet Draft             Information RPDL               October 2003 
 
 
   <xsd:enumeration value="equal"> 
   </xsd:restriction> 
   </xsd:simpleType> 
    
   All the query words will be defined as a series of combination of 
   logical operator, operator, and field. For example: 
    
   <logops>AND</logops> 
   <oprator>contain<operator> 
   <title>java</title> 
   It represents that the title of result must contain the "java". 
      
   The basicQuery is defined as follow. "title" represents the basic 
   description of a recorder. Field "title" is available in all the 
   metadata and databases. Book, video, webpage database all can provide 
   the search in "title". 
    
   <xsd:complexType name="BasicQuery"> 
   <xsd:complexType name="field" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"> 
   <xsd:sequence> 
   <xsd:element ref="logops"> 
   <xsd:element ref="operator"> 
   <xsd:element name="title" type="xsd:string"> 
   </xsd:sequence> 
   </xsd:complexType> 
   </xsd:complexType> 
    
    
   The advancedQuery is defined as follow. Selecting the "keywords", 
   "author", "keywords" as the search fields is because these fields are 
   normally available in most databases and metadata.  
    
   <xsd:simpleType name="AdvancedField"> 
   <xsd:restriction base="xsd:string"> 
   <xsd:enumeration value="title"> 
   <xsd:enumeration value="keywords"> 
   <xsd:enumeration value="author"> 
   <xsd:enumeration value="abstract"> 
   </xsd:restriction> 
   </xsd:simpleType> 
    
   <xsd:complexType name="advancedQuery"> 
   <xsd:complexType name="field" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"> 
   <xsd:sequence> 
   <xsd:element ref="logops"> 
   <xsd:element ref="operator"> 
   <xsd:element ref="AdvancedField"> 
   </xsd:sequence> 
   </xsd:complexType>

   </xsd:complexType> 
    
    
   The fullQuery is defined as follow. FullQuery will provide all the 
   search field of one database. They will be decided by the database 
   owners. 
    
   <xsd:simpleType name="FullField"> 
   <xsd:restriction base="xsd:string"> 
   <xsd:enumeration value="title"> 
   <xsd:enumeration value="keywords"> 
   <!--and so on--> 
   </xsd:restriction> 
   </xsd:simpleType> 
    
   <xsd:complexType name="FullQuery"> 
   <xsd:complexType name="field" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"> 
   <xsd:sequence> 
   <xsd:element ref="logops"> 
   <xsd:element ref="operator"> 
   <xsd:element ref="FullField"> 
   </xsd:sequence> 
   </xsd:complexType> 
   </xsd:complexType> 
 
2.3 class and function 
    
   The standard Webservice with its class structures and functions are 
   detailed here and also presented in the form of WSDL [1].  
    
   There are three function components in a search Webservice.1 receive 
   the query words and return results.2 analyze and explain the results. 
   3 depict every recorder of the results. All these functions are 
   implemented with three classes of Webservice.   
    
    
2.3.1 Class Search 
    
   Main function of this class is to submit a query string and a set of 
   parameters to the search service and receive in return a set of 
   search results. 
    
   There are three levels of search function according to the three 
   kinds of query words in this class: basic search, advanced search, 
   full search. 
    
   a. Basic search 
    
   basicSearch( 
 
 
WANG,et al               Expires - April 2004                 [Page 5] 
Internet Draft             Information RPDL               October 2003 
 
 
   query as basicQuery, 
   start as integer, 
   maxResults as Integer) 
    
   query: XML format parameter, it accords with the different 
   definitions of query words.   
    
   start: Zero-based index of the first desired result. 
    
   maxResults: Number of results desired per query. The maximum value 
   per query set to 100, and the minimum is defined as 1. If you make a 
   query that doesn't have many matching items, the actual number of 
   results you get may be smaller than that of you request. 
    
   b. Advanced search 
    
   advancedSearch( 
   query as advancedQuery,  
   dateStart as date, 
   dateEnd as date, 
   start as Integer, 
   maxResults as Integer, 
   orderby as String, 
   order as string) 
    
    
   dateStart,dateEnd: present date range. If you want to limit your 
   results to document that are published within a specific date range, 
   you can use this query term to accomplish this.  
    
   orderby: the sort order of the results. It can be "date" which means 
   sorting by date or "Relevance" which means sorting by the relation 
   between results recorders and query, or "title", sorting by field  
   "title". 
    
   Order: can be "descending" or "ascending", recorders is sorted in 
   descending or ascending.  
     
    
   c. Full search 
 
   fullSearch( 
   query as fullQuery, 
    Start as Integer, 
    maxResults as Integer, 
   other parameters) 
 
   Full search will provides all the query formats of one database. They 
   will be guaranteed by the database owners.

2.3.2 Class Search Response 
 
   Each time you issue a search request to the search service, a 
   response is returned back to you. This class describes the meanings 
   of the values returned to you. The characters of this class are 
   described as follows.  
    
   TotalResultsCount: The estimated total number of results that exist 
   for the query. 
    
   resultElements: An array of "resultElement" items. This corresponds 
   to the actual list of search results. 
    
   startIndex:Indicates the index (1-based) of the first search result 
   in "resultElements". 
    
   endIndex: Indicates the index (1-based) of the last search result in 
   "resultElements". 
    
   searchTime :Text, floating-point number indicating the total server 
   time to return the search results, which measured in seconds. 
    
2.3.3 Class Result Element 
 
   This class describes every record in return results. This Class has 
   three characters as follows.  
    
   Sourcename: name of the information source.  
    
   Title: title of the search recorder. 
    
   URL: The URL of the recorder, returned as text, with an absolute URL 
   path. 
    
   Otherinformation: some information such as a snippet of a webpage, 
   author of the recorder. This character will be defined according to 
   different search Webservice.

3 The description of the search Webservice 
 
   To describe the search Webservice, we refer the UDDI[2]. Search 
   Webservice Description, Discovery and Integration (SDDI) is proposed 
   in this part. SDDI will help the search system find and select the 
   appropriate data sources. 
    
3.1 The XML schema of the SDDI 
 
   We use the DC[3] standard to descript the character of the search 
   Webservice. 9 of 15 sub elements of DC are selected and divided into 
   three groups. The other basic information for a web service is also 
   added in the SDDI. Because all the search services use the uniform 
   standard Webservice, the business service, binding template and Model 
   in UDDI will be useless in SDDI. The information like BusinessEntity 
   in UDDI is enough to identify a search Webservice.  
    
   The elements and attributes to describe a search Webservice are 
   represented as follows.

3.2 The API of SDDI 
 
3.2.1 Publish 
 
   When a library purchase a database, a SDDI of this database will be 
   authorized at the same time and saved at the local servers. The 
   library can revise the SDDI itself according to its own needs. 
    
3.2.2 Inquiry API 
 
   Inquiry API will provide two simple functions that help the search 
   engine find the appreciate Webservice that matches the requirements 
   of users. The definition of element should refer the SDDI. Meanwhile, 
   the element can have complex structure.  
    
   1 find(element,value) 
    
   Element:the name of element. 
   Value: the value of element,which is xml format according to the 
   different element of SDDI. 
    
   This function returns the accesspoint according to the element and 
   its value. For example: 
    
   find(title, "ACM") 
    
   This function will return the "acesspoint" of SDDI whose element 
   "title" is "ACM". 
    
   2 get(element1,value,element2) 
    
   Return the value of element2 according to the value of element1.the 
   format of results is XML. For example: 
    
   Get((title, "ACM", character) 
    
   This function will return the element "character" of SDDI whose 
   element "title" is "ACM". 
    
4. Security Considerations 
    
   Since the databases are always purchased by some organization, the IP 
   access control will be used to protect the copyright. 
    
   The organization will build their own search engine based on this 
   protocol, so the Webservice and SDDI will not open to end user. The 
   more additional security concerns should be decided by the 
   corresponding organization.
