Abstract

   IEEE 802.1 has specified Connectivity Fault Management (CFM) OAM
   facilities. CFM messages are structured with an OpCode field and have
   provision for the inclusion of TLV (type, length, value) structured
   information. IEEE 802.1 has allocated blocks of CFM OpCodes and TLV
   Types to the IETF. This document specifies the IANA Considerations
   for the assignment of values from these blocks.

INTERNET-DRAFT                   IANA Considerations for CFM Code Points


1. Introduction

   The IEEE 802.1 Working Group has specified Connectivity Fault
   Management (CFM) [802.1Q] OAM [RFC6291] facilities. CFM messages are
   structured with an OpCode field and have provision for the inclusion
   of TLV (type, length, value) structured information.

   IEEE 802.1 has allocated the block of 32 CFM OpCodes from 64 through
   95 and the block of 32 CFM TLV Types from 64 through 95 to the IETF
   (see Appendix A). This document specifies the IANA Considerations for
   the assignment of values from these two blocks.

   IEEE 802.1 previously allocated similar blocks of the values from 32
   through 63 to ITU-T [Y.1731].



1.1 Terminology

   Capitalized IANA Considerations terms such as "Standards Action" are
   to be interpreted as described in [RFC5226].

2. IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to create a "CFM OAM IETF Parameters" Registry with
   two registries as follows:


         Registry Name: CFM OAM IETF OpCodes

         Registration Procedures: Standards Action

         Reference: [802.1Q] [this document]

         Note: This parameter originates with the IEEE 802.1 Working
         Group that has allocated the block of values from 64 to 95 to
         the IETF.

         Value    Assignment    Reference
         =====    ==========    =========
         64-95    Unassigned    [this document]


         Registry Name: CFM OAM IETF TLV Types

         Registration Procedures: Standards Action

         Reference: [802.1Q] [this document]

         Note: This parameter originates with the IEEE 802.1 Working
         Group that has allocated the block of values from 64 to 95 to
         the IETF.

         Value    Assignment    Reference
         =====    ==========    =========
         64-95    Unassigned    [this document]



3. Security Considerations

   This document is concerned with assignment of values from the blocks
   of IEEE 802.1 CFM OpCodes and TLV Types that the IEEE 802.1 Working
   Group has allocated to the IETF. It is not directly concerned with
   security.

Appendix A: IEEE 802.1 WG Liaison

   To:         Jari Arkko, IETF chair
   cc:         Stephen J. Trowbridge, ITU-T SG15 chair,
               Donald Eastlake, Erik Nordmark, IETF TRILL WG,
               Eric Gray, IETF/IEEE liaison

   From:       Tony Jeffree, IEEE 802.1 WG Chair

   Date:       Thursday, 06 March 2014

   Reference:  24 September 2013 Liaison from TRILL WG

   After considering the referenced liaison from the TRILL WG,
   IEEE 802.1 has voted to approve the allocation of code points
   from the Connectivity Fault Management protocol of IEEE Std
   802.1Q(TM)-2011 for use by IETF.  The expectation of IEEE
   802.1 is that these code points will be allocated through
   IANA only on the basis of IETF standards actions.
   Specifically, the allocation includes:


     + 32 CFM OpCode Field values. Reference IEEE Std 802.1Q-2011

       Clause 21.4.3, Table 21-4. The OpCode Field values 64-95
                                                               10
       are allocated to the IETF.


     + 32 TLV Type Field values. Reference IEEE Std 802.1Q-2011

       Clause 21.5.1.1, Table 21-6. The Type Field values 64-95
                                                               10
       are allocated to the IETF.


   IEEE Std 802.1Q will be revised at some future date to document this
   allocation. In the meantime, the allocation will be recorded through
   the IEEE 802.1 maintenance process.

   Regards,

   Tony Jeffree
   IEEE 802.1 Working Group Chair
