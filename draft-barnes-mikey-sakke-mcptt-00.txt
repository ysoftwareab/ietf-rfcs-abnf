 Mission Critical Push-to-Talk (MCPTT) Group Key Transport using MIKEY-
                                 SAKKE
                 draft-barnes-mikey-sakke-mcptt-00.txt

Abstract

   3GPP TS 33.179 defines the group services and system aspects for the
   Security of Mission Critical Push-To-Talk (MCPTT) service.  To create
   a group's security association, a Group Master Key (GMK) and
   associated identifier (GMK-ID) is distributed to MCPTT User Equipment
   (UE) by a Group Management Server (GMS).  The GMK is distributed
   encrypted specifically to a user and signed using an identity
   representing the Group Management Server.  The GMK is distributed
   within a Group Key Transport payload, which is a MIKEY-SAKKE
   I_MESSAGE, as defined in RFC 6509, which ensures the confidentiality,
   integrity and authenticity of the payload.  In order to convey the
   MCPTT specific service in the MIKEY-SAKKE I_MESSAGE, this document
   defines new values for the Type field of the General Extensions
   Payload Field defined for MIKEY in RFC 3830 the ID Role field in RFC
   6043 and the ID Scheme field in RFC 6509.

1.  Overview

   Multimedia Internet KEYing-Sakai-Kasahara Key Encryption (MIKEY-
   SAKKE) defines a method of key exchange that uses Identity-based
   Public Key Cryptography (IDPKC) to establish a shared secret value
   and certificateless signatures to provide source authentication.
   This scheme makes use of a Key Management Service (KMS) as a root of
   trust and distributor of key material.

   3GPP TS 33.179 [TS33179] defines the Group Services and System
   Aspects for the Security of Mission Critical Push-To-Talk (MCPTT).
   To create a group's security association, a Group Master Key (GMK)
   and associated identifier (GMK-ID) is distributed to MCPTT User
   Equipment (UE) by a Group Management Server (GMS).  The GMK is
   distributed encrypted specifically to a user and signed using an

   identity representing the Group Management Server.  The GMK is
   distributed within a Group Key Transport payload.  This payload is a
   MIKEY-SAKKE I_MESSAGE, as defined in RFC 6509 [RFC6509], which
   ensures the confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of the
   payload.

2.  Group Key Transport Payload

   3GPP TS 24.381 [TS24381] details the procedures for composing the
   MIKEY-SAKKE I_MESSAGE for the Group Key Transport payload.  These
   procedures require the definition of new values for the Type field of
   the General Extensions Payload Field in RFC 3830 [RFC3830], the ID
   Role field in RFC 6043 [RFC6043] and the ID Scheme field in RFC 6509
   [RFC6509].

2.1.  Type field of the General Extensions Payload Field

   RFC 3830 [RFC3830] defines the Type field as a General Extensions
   Payload Field Name.  Two new values are defined to indicate the
   general payload types specific to MCPTT.  The following describes the
   two new values, to be assigned by IANA:

   o  "SAKKE-to-self (value TBD1):" Indicates that the Data field of a
      General Extension Payload contains a SAKKE Payload as specified in
      RFC 6509 [RFC6509]

   o  "GMK associated parameters (value TBD2):" Indicates that the Data
      field of a General Extension Payload contains the associated
      parameters of GMK as specified in 3GPP TS 33.179 [TS33179] figure
      E.6.1-1.

2.2.  ID Role Field

   The MIKEY-SAKKE I_MESSAGE contains an IDR Payload as defined in
   [RFC6043].  The IDR payload uses all the fields from the standard
   Identity (ID) payload but expands it with a field describing the role
   of the ID payload.  The ID Role describes the meaning of the identity
   itself.  The following describes the two new values, to be assigned
   by IANA, of the ID Role field specific to MCPTT:

   o  "IDRuidr (value TBD3):" Indicates that the ID Data field of an ID
      Payload contains a User Identity (UID) generated from the MCPTT ID
      of an MCPTT user or a UID generated from the MCPTT Group ID of an
      MCPTT group, as specified in 3GPP TS 33.179 [TS33179].

   o  "IDRuidi (value TBD4):" Indicates that the ID Data field of an ID
      Payload contains a UID generated from the GMS's URI as specified
      in 3GPP TS 33.179 [TS33179].

2.3.  ID Scheme Field

   RFC 6509 [RFC6509] defines the ID Scheme field of the SAKKE Payload.
   The following describes the two new values, to be assigned by IANA,
   for the ID Scheme field for usage in MCPTT:

   o  "MCPTT ID scheme (value TBD5):" Indicates that the The SAKKE Data
      field of a SAKKE Payload contains the GMK encapsulated to the UID
      generated from the IDRr payload or extracted from the IDRuidr
      payload according to 3GPP TS 33.179 [TS33179] subclause F.2.1.

   o  "MCPTT SAKKE-to-self (value TBD6):" Indicates that the SAKKE Data
      field of a SAKKE Payload contains the GMK encapsulated to the UID
      generated from the IDRi payload or extracted from the IDRuidi
      payload according to 3GPP TS 33.179 [TS33179] subclause F.2.1.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines new values for registration of the Type field
   of the General Extensions Payload Field in RFC 3830 [RFC3830], the ID
   Role field in RFC 6043 [RFC6043] and the ID Scheme field in RFC 6509
   [RFC6509] required to support MCPTT, are detailed.  The IANA
   registrations for these new values are described in the following
   sections.

3.1.  Registration of Type field values for MCPTT

   This document defines two new Type field values to support MCPTT as
   described in section Section 2.1.  The following changes have been
   made to the Type field in the General Extensions Payload registry of
   the MIKEY Payload Name Spaces:

   Value              ID Role                   Reference
   ------         ---------------------------   --------------
    TBD1           SAKKE-to-self                 [RFCxxxx]
    TBD2           GMK associated parameters     [RFCxxxx]

   Note to RFC Editor: Please replace RFC XXXX with the RFC number of
   this specification.

3.2.  Registration of ID Role values for MCPTT

   This document defines two new ID Role values to support MCPTT,
   indicating the generator of the UID as described in section
   Section 2.2.  The following changes have been made to the ID Role
   registry of the MIKEY Payload Name Spaces:

    TBD4           GMS URI (IDRuidi)              [RFCxxxx]

   Note to RFC Editor: Please replace RFC XXXX with the RFC number of
   this specification.

3.3.  Registration of ID Scheme values for MCPTT

   This document defines two new ID Scheme values to support MCPTT,
   indicating the scheme of the SAKKE Payload, as described in section
   Section 2.3.  The following changes have been made to the ID Scheme
   registry of the MIKEY Payload Name Spaces:

   Value              ID Role                     Reference
   -----         ---------------------------   --------------
    TBD5           MCPTT ID scheme                [RFCxxxx]
    TBD6           MCPTT SAKKE-to-self            [RFCxxxx]

   Note to RFC Editor: Please replace RFC XXXX with the RFC number of
   this specification.

4.  Security Considerations

   3GPP TS 33.179 [TS33179] defines the Group Services and System
   Aspects for the Security of Mission Critical Push-To-Talk (MCPTT).
   This document introduces no new security considerations beyond those
   defined in RFC 6509 [RFC6509].

5.  Acknowledgements

   Ivo Sedlacek provided input and feedback on the details around the
   definition of the new values for these fields.
