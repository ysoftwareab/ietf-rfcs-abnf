Abstract 

   This document is a product of the Internet Printing Protocol Working 
   Group of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).  Comments should
   be submitted to the ipp@pwg.org mailing list.  
   
   The open issues in this document each begin 'ISSUE_n:'.  
   
   This document specifies the "ipp" URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
   scheme for specifying the location of an IPP Printer which implements
   IPP/1.0 [RFC-2565] [RFC-2566], IPP/1.1 [RFC-2910] [RFC-2911], or any
   later version of IPP.  This document is intended for use in
   registering the "ipp" URL scheme with IANA and fully conforms to the
   requirements in [RFC-2717].  
   
   The IPP URL scheme defined in this document is based on the ABNF for
   the basic hierarchical URL syntax in [RFC-2396]; however relative URL
   forms, parameters, and/or query parts are NOT allowed in an IPP URL.
   The IPP URL scheme is case-insensitive in the host name or host
   address part; however the path part is case-sensitive, as in
   [RFC-2396].  Codepoints outside [US-ASCII] MUST be hex escaped by the
   mechanism defined in [RFC-2396].

4.  IPP URL Scheme

   
   
   
   4.1.  IPP URL Scheme Applicability and Intended Usage
   
   In this document, "IPP Client" means the software (on some hardware
   platform) that submits, monitors, and/or manages print jobs via
   IPP/1.0 [RFC-2565] [RFC-2566], IPP/1.1 [RFC-2910] [RFC-2911], or any
   later version of IPP to a spooler, gateway, or actual printing
   device.  
   
   In this document, "IPP Printer" means the software (on some hardware 
   platform) that receives print jobs and/or job operations via IPP/1.0 
   [RFC-2565] [RFC-2566], IPP/1.1 [RFC-2910] [RFC-2911], or any later
   version of IPP from an "IPP Client".  
   
   The "IPP Printer" is identified via an IPP URL.  This IPP URL MUST
   NOT contain any parameters or query part.  
   
   The IPP URL scheme defined in this document is based on the ABNF for
   the basic hierarchical URL syntax in [RFC-2396]; however relative URL
   forms, parameters, and/or query parts are NOT allowed in an IPP URL.
   The IPP URL scheme is case-insensitive in the host name or host
   address part; however the path part is case-sensitive, as in
   [RFC-2396].  Codepoints outside [US-ASCII] MUST be hex escaped by the
   mechanism defined in [RFC-2396].  
   
   
   
   4.2.  IPP URL Scheme Associated IPP Port
   
   All IPP URLs which do NOT explicitly specify a port MUST be used over
   IANA-assigned port 631 for the IPP protocol described in [RFC-2910].
   
   See:  Appendix A in this document which updates the existing IPP port
   registration with IANA.  
   
   
   
   4.3.  IPP URL Scheme Associated MIME Type
   
   All IPP protocol operations (requests and responses) MUST be conveyed
   in an 'application/ipp' MIME media type as registered in
   [IANA-MIMEREG].  IPP URLs MUST refer to IPP Printers which support
   this 'application/ipp' MIME media type.  
   
   See:  Appendix B in this document.

   4.4.  IPP URL Scheme Syntax in ABNF
   
   The "ipp" URL scheme syntax is formally specified below in ABNF
   [RFC-2234].  This URL syntax is derived from [RFC-2396], [RFC-2732], 
   and [RFC-2373].  
                 ; note - parameters are NOT allowed on IPP URLs
                 ; note - query part is NOT allowed on IPP URLs
   ippURI        = "ipp://" hostport [ path ]
   
   hostport      = host [ ":" port ]

                 ; note - IPv6 support is added here
                 ; see RFC 2732 and RFC 2373 which update RFC 2396
   IPv6reference = "[" IPv6address "]"
   IPv6address   = hexpart [ ":" IPv4address ]
   IPv4address   = 1*3digit "." 1*3digit "." 1*3digit "." 1*3digit
   
   hexpart       = hexseq | hexseq "::" [ hexseq ] | "::" [ hexseq ]
   hexseq        = hex4 *( ":" hex4)
   hex4          = 1*4hex
   
   path          = "/" segments
   segments      = segment *( "/" segment )
   
                 ; note - parameters are NOT allowed on IPP URLs
                 ; see RFC 2396 which does allow parameters
   segment       = *segchar
   segchar       = unreserved | escaped |
                   ":" | "@" | "&" | "=" | "+" | "$" | ","
   
                 ; note - "[" and "]" are ADDED to 'reserved' for IPv6
                 ; see RFC 2732 and RFC 2373 which update RFC 2396
   reserved      = ";" | "/" | "?" | ":" | "@" | "&" | "=" | "+" |

   4.5.  IPP URL Scheme Character Encoding
   
   The IPP URL scheme defined in this document is based on the ABNF for
   the basic hierarchical URL syntax in [RFC-2396]; however relative URL
   forms, parameters, and/or query parts are NOT allowed in an IPP URL.
   The IPP URL scheme is case-insensitive in the host name or host
   address part; however the path part is case-sensitive, as in
   [RFC-2396].  Codepoints outside [US-ASCII] MUST be hex escaped by the
   mechanism defined in [RFC-2396].

5.  Conformance Requirements

   
   
   5.1.  Conformance Requirements for IPP Clients
   
   IPP Clients that conform to this specification:  
   
   a) MUST send valid IPP Jobs on port 631 (IANA-assigned default port
      for IPP) when contacting IPP Printers via IPP URLs that do NOT
      specify an explicit port; 
      
   b) MUST NOT send otherwise valid IPP Jobs on any port other than 631 
      (IANA-assigned default port for IPP) when contacting IPP Printers
      via IPP URLs that do NOT specify an explicit port; 
      
   c) MUST conform to the ABNF for IPP URLs specified in section 4.4 of
      this document.  
   
   
   
   5.2.  Conformance Requirements for IPP Printers
   
   IPP Printers that conform to this specification:  
   
   a) MUST accept valid IPP Jobs on port 631 (IANA-assigned default port
      for IPP) from IPP Clients that follow required client
      authentication and security mechanisms; 
      
   b) MUST reject otherwise valid IPP Jobs on any port other than 631
      (IANA-assigned default port for IPP) from IPP Clients that follow 
      required client authentication and security mechanisms, unless
      explicitly configured by system administrators or site policies
      (e.g., 'trap doors' on port 80 are prohibited); 
      
   c) MUST reject received IPP URLs (e.g.  in the "printer-uri"
      operation attribute in 'Print-Job') that do not conform to the
      ABNF for IPP URLs specified in section 4.4 of this document.

12.  Appendix A - Registration of IPP Port

   [Placeholder for updated IANA registration of IPP Port (631) - need
   input from Carl-Uno Manros].  



13.  Appendix B - Registration of MIME "application/ipp"

   This appendix contains the information that IANA requires for
   registering a MIME media type.  The information following this
   paragraph will be forwarded to IANA to update the registration of
   "application/ipp", whose contents are defined in Section 3 'Encoding
   of the Operation Layer' in [RFC-2910].  
   
   MIME type name:  application 
   
   MIME subtype name:  ipp 
   
   A Content-Type of "application/ipp" indicates an Internet Printing
   Protocol message body (request or response).  Currently there are two
   versions:  a) IPP/1.0 [Experimental], whose syntax is described in
   Section 3 'Encoding of the Operation Layer' in [RFC-2565], and whose 
   semantics are described in [RFC-2566]; and b) IPP/1.1 [Standards
   Track], whose syntax is described in Section 3 'Encoding of the
   Operation Layer' of [RFC-2910], and whose semantics are described in
   [RFC-2911].  
   
   Required parameters:  none 
   
   Optional parameters:  none 
   
   Encoding considerations:  
   
   IPP/1.1 protocol requests/responses MAY contain long lines and ALWAYS
   contain binary data (for example attribute value lengths).  
   
   Security considerations:  
   
   IPP/1.1 protocol requests/responses do not introduce any security
   risks not already inherent in the underlying transport protocols.
   Protocol mixed-version interworking rules in [RFC-2911] as well as
   protocol encoding rules in [RFC-2910] are complete and unambiguous.  
   
   Interoperability considerations:  
   
   IPP/1.1 requests (generated by clients) and responses (generated by
   servers) MUST comply with all conformance requirements imposed by the
   normative specifications [RFC-2911] and [RFC-2910].  Protocol

   encoding rules specified in [RFC-2910] are comprehensive, so that
   interoperability between conforming implementations is guaranteed
   (although support for specific optional features is not ensured).
   Both the "charset" and "natural-language" of all IPP/1.1 attribute
   values which are a LOCALIZED-STRING are explicit within IPP protocol 
   requests/responses (without recourse to any external information in
   HTTP, SMTP, or other message transport headers).  
   
   Published specifications:  
   
   [RFC-2565] R. Herriot, S. Butler, P. Moore, R. Turner.
              "Internet Printing Protocol/1.0: Encoding and Transport",
              RFC 2565, April 1999 (EXPERIMENTAL, obsolete).
   
   [RFC-2566] R. deBry, T. Hastings, R. Herriot, S. Isaacson, P. Powell.
              "Internet Printing Protocol/1.0: Model and Semantics",
              RFC 2566, April 1999 (EXPERIMENTAL, obsolete).
   
   [RFC-2910] R. Herriot, S. Butler, P. Moore, R. Turner, J. Wenn.
              "Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Encoding and Transport",
              RFC 2910, September 2000 (STANDARDS TRACK).
   
   [RFC-2911] T. Hastings, R. Herriot, R. deBry, S. Isaacson, P. Powell.
              "Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics",
              RFC 2911, September 2000 (STANDARDS TRACK).
   
   Applications which use this media type:  
   
   Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) print clients and print servers,
   communicating using HTTP/1.1 (see [RFC-2910]), SMTP/ESMTP, FTP, or
   other transport protocol.  Messages of type "application/ipp" are
   self-contained and transport-independent, including "charset" and
   "natural-language" context for any LOCALIZED-STRING value.

   [To be deleted before RFC publication] 
   
   11 January 2001 - draft-ietf-ipp-url-scheme-00.txt 
   - initial version - simple 'ipp:' URL scheme without parameters or
     query part (consistent with existing IPP/1.0 and IPP/1.1
     implementations).
