1.  Introduction

   The Softwire mesh framework RFC 5565 [RFC5565] is a tunneling
   mechanism that enables connectivity between islands of IPv4 networks
   across a single IPv6 backbone and vice versa.  In a softwire mesh,
   extended multiprotocol-BGP (MP-BGP) is used to set up tunnels and
   advertise prefixes among address family border routers (AFBRs).

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular it defines objects for managing a softwire mesh
   [RFC5565].

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).  They

Internet-Draft                   swmMIB                    December 2015


   are defined using the mechanisms stated in the Structure of
   Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB module that
   is compliant to the SMIv2 (Structure of Management Information
   Version 2), which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58,
   RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

3.  Terminology

   This document uses terminology from the softwire problem statement
   RFC 4925 [RFC4925], the BGP encapsulation subsequent address family
   identifier (SAFI) and the BGP tunnel encapsulation attribute RFC 5512
   [RFC5512], the softwire mesh framework RFC 5565 [RFC5565] and the BGP
   IPsec tunnel encapsulation attributeand RFC 5566 [RFC5566].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

4.  Structure of the MIB Module

   The softwire mesh MIB provides a method to monitor the softwire mesh
   objects through SNMP.

4.1.  The swmSupportedTunnelTable Subtree

   The swmSupportedTunnelTable subtree provides the information about
   what types of tunnels can be used for softwire mesh scenarios in the
   AFBR.  The softwire mesh framework RFC 5565 [RFC5565] does not
   mandate the use of any particular tunneling technology.  Based on the
   BGP tunnel encapsulation attribute tunnel types introduced by RFC
   5512[RFC5512] and RFC 5566[RFC5566], the softwire mesh tunnel types
   include at least L2TPv3 (Layer Two Tunneling Protocol-Version 3) over
   IP, GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation), Transmit tunnel endpoint,
   IPsec in Tunnel-mode, IP in IP tunnel with IPsec Transport Mode,
   MPLS-in-IP tunnel with IPsec Transport Mode and IP in IP.  The
   detailed encapsulation information of different tunnel types (e.g.,
   L2TPv3 Session ID, GRE Key, etc.) is not managed in the swmMIB.

4.2.  The swmEncapsTable Subtree

   The swmEncapsTable subtree provides softwire mesh NLRI-NH information
   (Network Layer Reachability Information-Next Hop) about the AFBR.  It
   keeps the mapping between the External-IP (E-IP) prefix and the
   Internal-IP (I-IP) address of the next hop.  The mappings determine
   which I-IP destination address will be used to encapsulate the
   received packet according to its E-IP destination address.  The
   definitions of E-IP and I-IP are explained in section 4.1 of RFC

   5565[RFC5565].  The number of entries in swmEncapsTable shows how
   many softwire mesh tunnels are maintained in this AFBR.

4.3.  The swmBGPNeighborTable Subtree

   The subtree provides the softwire mesh BGP neighbor information of an
   AFBR.  It includes the address of the softwire mesh BGP peer, and the
   kind of tunnel that the AFBR would use to communicate with this BGP
   peer.

4.4.  The swmConformance Subtree

   The subtree provides the conformance information of MIB objects.

5.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

5.1.  Relationship to the IF-MIB

   The Interfaces MIB [RFC2863] defines generic managed objects for
   managing interfaces.  Each logical interface (physical or virtual)
   has an ifEntry.  Tunnels are handled by creating logical interfaces
   (ifEntry).  Being a tunnel, softwire mesh interface has an entry in
   the Interface MIB, as well as an entry in IP Tunnel MIB.  Those
   corresponding entries are indexed by ifIndex.

   The ifOperStatus in the ifTable represents whether the mesh function
   of the AFBR has been triggered.  If the softwire mesh capability is
   negotiated during the BGP OPEN phase, the mesh function is considered
   to be started, and the ifOperStatus is "up".  Otherwise the
   ifOperStatus is "down".

   In the case of an IPv4-over-IPv6 softwire mesh tunnel, ifInUcastPkts
   counts the number of IPv6 packets which are sent to the virtual
   interface for decapsulation into IPv4.  The ifOutUcastPkts counts the
   number of IPv6 packets which are generated by encapsulating IPv4
   packets sent to the virtual interface.  Particularly, if these IPv4
   packets need fragmentation, ifOutUcastPkts counts the number of
   packets after fragmentation.

   In the case of an IPv6-over-IPv4 softwire mesh tunnel, ifInUcastPkts
   counts the number of IPv4 packets, which are delivered up to the
   virtual interface for decapsulation into IPv6.  The ifOutUcastPkts
   counts the number of IPv4 packets, which are generated by
   encapsulating IPv6 packets sent down to the virtual interface.
   Particularly, if these IPv6 packets need to be fragmented,
   ifOutUcastPkts counts the number of packets after fragmentation.
   Similar definitions apply to other counter objects in the ifTable.

5.2.  Relationship to the IP Tunnel MIB

   The IP Tunnel MIB [RFC4087] contains objects applicable to all IP
   tunnels, including softwire mesh tunnels.  Meanwhile, the Softwire
   Mesh MIB extends the IP Tunnel MIB to further describe encapsulation-
   specific information.

   When running a point to multi-point tunnel, it is necessary for a
   softwire mesh AFBR to maintain an encapsulation table in order to
   perform correct "forwarding" among AFBRs.  This forwarding function
   on an AFBR is performed by using the E-IP destination address to look
   up in the encapsulation table for the I-IP encapsulation destination
   address.  An AFBR also needs to know the BGP peer information of the
   other AFBRs, so that it can negotiate the NLRI-NH information and the
   tunnel parameters with them.

   The Softwire mesh MIB requires the implementation of the IP Tunnel
   MIB.  The tunnelIfEncapsMethod in the tunnelIfEntry MUST be set to
   softwireMesh("xx"), and a corresponding entry in the softwire mesh
   MIB module will be presented for the tunnelIfEntry.  The
   tunnelIfRemoteInetAddress MUST be set to "0.0.0.0" for IPv4 or "::"
   for IPv6 because it is a point to multi-point tunnel.

   -- RFC Ed.: Please replace "xx" with IANA assigned number here.

   The tunnelIfAddressType in the tunnelIfTable represents the type of
   address in the corresponding tunnelIfLocalInetAddress and
   tunnelIfRemoteInetAddress objects.  The tunnelIfAddressType is
   identical to swmEncapsIIPDstType in softwire mesh, which can support
   either IPv4-over-IPv6 or IPv6-over-IPv4.  When the
   swmEncapsEIPDstType is IPv6 and the swmEncapsIIPDstType is IPv4, the
   tunnel type is IPv6-over-IPv4; When the swmEncapsEIPDstType is IPv4
   and the swmEncapsIIPDstType is IPv6, the encapsulation mode would be
   IPv4-over-IPv6.

5.3.  MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   The following MIB module IMPORTS objects from SNMPv2-SMI [RFC2578],
   SNMPv2-CONF [RFC2580], IF-MIB [RFC2863] and INET-ADDRESS-MIB
   [RFC4001].

7.  Security Considerations

   Because this MIB module reuses the IP tunnel MIB, the security
   considerations of the IP tunnel MIB is also applicable to the
   Softwire mesh MIB.

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this
   MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an
   intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB
   module via direct SNMP SET operations.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are objects and their sensitivity/
   vulnerability.

   Particularly, swmSupportedTunnelType, swmEncapsIIPDstType,
   swmEncapsIIPDst and swmBGPNeighborTunnelType can expose the types of
   tunnels used within the internal network, and potentially reveal the
   topology of the internal network.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.

   Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the
   SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming
   compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for
   authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)
   [RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].  Implementations
   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model

   (TSM)[RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH
   [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

8.  IANA Considerations

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry, and
   the following IANA-assigned tunnelType values recorded in the
   IANAtunnelType-MIB registry:

           Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
           ----------        -----------------------
           swmMIB            { mib-2 xxx }

           IANAtunnelType ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
                 SYNTAX     INTEGER {
                            softwireMesh ("xx")  -- softwire Mesh tunnel
                            }
