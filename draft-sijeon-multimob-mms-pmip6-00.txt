Internet-Draft    Mobile Multicasting Support in PMIPv6        July 2009


Abstract

   To support IP-based group communication such as mobile IPTV in mobile
   environment, IP multicasting is required. Two major constraints in
   mobile multicasting are the tunnel convergence problem and high
   handover latency. To reduce the constraints, several mobile
   multicasting schemes based on Mobile IP have been proposed. To
   provide efficient mobile multicast service related to two problems,
   we present a multicasting architecture and fast handover scheme for
   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6).

Internet-Draft    Mobile Multicasting Support in PMIPv6        July 2009


1. Introduction

   High performance of wireless technologies make multimedia streaming
   services possible, such as IPTV audio/video stream. These services
   are based on group communication, and IP multicasting is also
   required. Traditional IP multicast mechanisms, including multicast
   routing and membership management protocols, have been designed for
   static hosts [2]. Moreover, up to now, IP mobility protocol for
   mobile multicasting has depended on host-based Mobile IP variants
   (Mobile IP and Fast Mobile IPv6). However, Mobile IP variant
   protocols require modifications to an applied solution on mobile
   device, as well as IP reconfiguration during handoff. The Proxy
   Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) in [3] does not require any mobility-related
   protocol, and IP reconfiguration in the same PMIPv6 domain. With the
   strength of PMIPv6, several service solutions are described in [4].
   However, the solution needs to solve two major constraints: the
   tunnel convergence problem and high handover latency [5]. Thus, we
   present a multicasting architecture and fast handover operation while
   considering the requirements for PMIPv6.

           Figure 1: Multicasting architecture in PMIPv6 domain


   To design PMIPv6-based multicasting services, we should consider the
   position of the multicast router (MR). If an LMA contains the MR
   function, it introduces a tunnel convergence problem similar to
   Mobile IP variant bi-directional tunnel schemes. To solve the
   problem, we separated the MR function from the LMA. Moreover, if a
   MAG has an MR function and if a local MR is connected with MAGs, the
   routing update overhead degrades the performance of PMIPv6 components
   due to the frequent movement of the MNs. Thus, Figure 1 shows a
   proposed PMIPv6 multicasting architecture where the MAG contains only
   an MLD forwarding proxy function using the IGMP/MLD forwarding proxy
   [6] proposed by the IETF. This model can solve the tunnel convergence
   problem and reduce the routing processing overhead. In this draft, we
   consider only the point-to-point link between the MN and the MAG as
   defined in RFC 5213 [3]. Therefore, some optimized techniques are

   required to reduce duplicated multicasting over the point-to-point
   link.

           Figure 2: Fast multicast handover procedure using PMIPv6

   Directly applying a PMIPv6 handover scheme to the proposed network
   model leads to service disruption due to the latency caused by the
   MLD query/report. To solve this problem, we proposed a fast handover
   scheme using the context transfer mechanism. Figure 2 shows the
   handover operation. When an MN hands off, the MAG with the MLD
   forwarding proxy predicts an MN's movement direction and transfers
   the multicast context message, which includes the MN ID, the MN home
   network prefix, the current MAG address, and the multicast group

   address. The N-MAG then checks whether it is receiving a node of
   multicast data corresponding to the group requested by the P-MAG. If
   this is not the case, it joins the group by sending an MLD report.

5. Message Formats

   To suit the format of the Proxy MIPv6 messages, PMIPv6 multicast
   context transfer option message is encoded according to the message
   data encoding rules for the Mobility Header (MH) as specified in
   [RFC3775]. Parameters being carried by any of these messages are
   encoded as message options according to the type-length-value format
   specified in [RFC3775]. Specified about the message and message
   option format are TBD.


6. IANA Considerations

   TBD.

7. Security Considerations

   This document does not discuss any special security concerns in
   detail.  The protocol of this document is built on the assumption
   that all participating nodes are trusted each other as well as there
   is no adversary who modifies/injects false messages to corrupt the
   procedures.
