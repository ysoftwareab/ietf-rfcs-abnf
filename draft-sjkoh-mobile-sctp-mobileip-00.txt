 Abstract 
  
     SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) is a new reliable 
     transport protocol that is featured multi-streaming and multi-
     homing over TCP. Mobile SCTP (mSCTP) is defined as SCTP with the 
     ADDIP extension. In this document, we discuss the use of mSCTP 
     along with Mobile IP for IP mobile support in the harmonized 
     manner. The use of SCTP with Mobile IP is focused on the mobile 
     sessions that are initiated by CN to MN. The sessions initiated by 
     MN can be supported only by mobile SCTP.

 1. Introduction 
  
    The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) [1, 2, 3] that 
    provides the multihoming feature. Without support of routers in the 
    networks, the SCTP with the ADDIP extension [4] that is called 
    mobile SCTP (mSCTP) can be used to provide seamless handover for 
    the mobile sessions that are originated by Correspondent Nodes (CN) 
    toward to Mobile Nodes (MN) [5, 6].  
     
    The mobile SCTP can also be used for the mobile sessions that are 
    initiated by CN toward MN, if it is used along with the Mobile IP 
    [7, 8]. In this case, the Mobile IP is used for location management, 
    by which the CN finds the location of MN with help of Home Agent.  
     
    Specifically, Mobile IP will be used only for the CN to find the 
    current location of MN and to establish an SCTP association. Once 
    the SCTP association has been established, the SCTP session will be 
    supported by the mSCTP seamless handover procedures [5, 6]. 
     
    This document is intended to continue a discussion to explore the 
    use of SCTP for IP mobility support. Please send comments to the

 2. Motivations on Mobile SCTP for IP Mobility Support 
      
 2.1 Mobility Management Issues 
  
    Generically, IP mobility management issues are divided into 
    Location Management and Handover Management. To support the 
    Internet host mobility, the following two functions are required: 
    Location Management and Handover Management.  
     
 2.1.1 Location Management 
  
    Location Management is to identify the current location of a mobile 
    node and keep track of its changes as it moves on. Basically, the 
    location management is done so as to prepare the call setup for the 
    sessions that are requested to mobile nodes (MN) from correspondent 
    nodes (CN). With help of location management, the CN will be able 
    to locate the MN and to establish a session via an appropriate call 
    setup process. 
     
    In Mobile IPv4 [7], Home Agent (HA) and Foreign Agent (FA) are 
    employed for location management. The Home Address (HoA) is used as 
    a host identifier of an MN, whereas the Care-of Address (CoA) is 
    used as a location identifier of the MN. The HA maintains the 
    information on the current location of each mobile node by binding 
    CoA of FA to HoA of MN. In case that a Collaborated CoA (CCoA) is 
    used instead of CoA, MIPv4 need not use the FA. By this, an 
    external CN will be able to establish a session with an MN. 
     
    In Mobile IPv6 [8], the HA is employed for location management. 
    Similar to MIPv4, HoA and CoA are used as a host identifier and a 
    location identifier of the MN, respectively. The CoA of MIPv6 is 
    the same as CCoA of MIPv4. By using MIPv6, an external CN will be 
    able to establish a session with an MN. 
     
    In Mobile IP, it is noted that the HoA is also used by the 
    applications of an MN, since the MN binds its applications to the 
    HoA. In this respect, HoA is also used for IP packet data transport. 
  
 2.1.2 Handover Management 
  
    Handover Management is used to provide mobile hosts for seamless 
    handover, whenever they move into different IP network regions 
    during a session. The main objective of the seamless handover is to 
    minimize the service disruption due to data loss and/or latency 
    during the handover period. 
     
    In Mobile IP, the Low Latency handover for MIPv4 [9] and Fast 
    Handover for MIPv6 [10] have been designed for handover management. 
    These MIP-based handover schemes rely on the tunneling between old 
    and new Access Routers (ARs).

 2.2 Mobile SCTP in the viewpoint of Mobility Management 
  
    In terms of mobile Internet services, a session involved by a 
    mobile node can be classified into one of the following two types: 
      
        a. Session originated from MN toward CN 
        b. Session originated from CN toward MN 
         
    The mobile sessions in (a) seem to be a natural extension of the 
    classical client-server model, in which the mobile host originating 
    the session can be viewed as a client, while the counter endpoint 
    will function as a server. For this type of session, the location 
    management is not a crucial requirement. Only the seamless handover 
    will be required in terms of IP mobility management. 
      
    On the other hand, the case (b) requires the location management by 
    which the session originator, CN, can locate the mobile host, MN, 
    as supported in Mobile IP. 
  
 2.2.1 For Seamless Handover 
  
    Mobile SCTP (mSCTP) [5, 6], in its present form, is targeted for 
    mobile sessions that are initiated by MNs toward CNs located in the 
    fixed networks. The mSCTP is used to provide seamless handover for 
    mobile nodes that change their IP addresses by continual moving 
    across different IP subnets. These sessions do not require location 
    management.  
     
    The detailed schemes for seamless handover using mSCTP are 
    described with some implementation issues in [5, 6]. In this 
    section, we briefly summarize the mSCTP handover procedures. 
     
    Assuming that an MN established an SCTP session with a CN within 
    Location A, the generic procedures for seamless handover from 
    Location A to Location B are as follows: 
     
       Step 1. Initially, the MN is single homing in Location A. 
        
       Step 2. While the MN approaches Location B, it obtains a new IP 
               address from Location B (its AR). The MN is now dual 
               homing by binding the new address to its SCTP 
               association. 
              
       Step 3. The MN notifies the new IP address to the CN by sending 
               an SCTP Address Configuration Change (ASCONF) chunk to 
               the CN. The MN may also set the new IP address to be the 
               Primary IP address. While the MN is being dual homing in 
               the overlapping region, it will be able to receive the 
               IP packets from the CN, including original data packets 
               and retransmitted packets.

 INTERNET DRAFT     Use of SCTP for IP Mobility Support   February 2003 

       Step 4. When the MN cannot hear the wireless signal from 
               Location B, it deletes the old IP address from the SCTP 
               association by sending ASCONF chunk to the CN. 
        
    Steps 1 through 4 described above will be repeated whenever the MN 
    moves on across different IP subnets while the association is 
    active. 
        
    The mSCTP can be used to provide an alternative scheme for seamless 
    handover instead of the LMIPv4 and FMIPv6 schemes. The basic 
    difference between the MIP-based handover schemes and mSCTP is that 
    the mSCTP intrinsically realizes the handover in the transport 
    layer without any support of network routers, whereas the MIP-based 
    schemes rely on the support of routers support for tunneling 
    between old and new ARs. 
     
 2.2.2 For Location Management 
     
    To support the mobile sessions that are initiated by a CN toward an 
    MN, the mSCTP may be used along with a location management scheme 
    such as Mobile IP. 
     
    In this scenario, the MIP will be used for a CN to locate an MN and 
    to establish an SCTP association with the MN. After an SCTP 
    association is successfully setup, the mobile SCTP will be used for 
    providing seamless handover for the MN, as described in [5, 6]. 
     
     
 3. Mobile SCTP with Mobile IP for Location Management  
  
    For the present, the use of SCTP with MIP is focused on the mobile 
    sessions that are initiated by CN to MN. The sessions initiated by 
    MN can be supported only by mobile SCTP. 
     
    Specifically, Mobile IP will be used only for location management, 
    by which the CN locates the location of MN and establishes an SCTP 
    association. Once the SCTP association has been established, the 
    on-going SCTP session will be supported by the mSCTP seamless 
    handover procedures [5, 6]. 
     
    A part of the MIP functionality for data transport, will not be 
    used in SCTP with MIP. If once the association is established, the 
    data transport between MN and CN relies on SCTP over IP. The 
    tunneling between HA and MN is not used. Furthermore, the Home 
    Address (HoA) of MN is not used for the data transport. Note that 
    the HoA is used for only the location management.

 3.1 Initiation of an SCTP association over Mobile IP 
     
    As described in RFC 2960 [1], the SCTP initialization is done from 
    CN and MN as follow (also see Figure 1): 
     
      a. CN sends INIT chunk to MN for triggering the association setup. 
     
         INIT chunk contains a list of IP addresses and port number 
         will be used by CN.  
     
      b. MN responds with INIT-ACK chunk to CN. 
     
         INIT-ACK chunk contains a list of IP addresses and port number 
         will be used by CN. It can also contain indication about which 
         is the primary address among multiple addresses, if any (See 
         [4]). 
     
      c. Then, CN and MN exchange COOKIE-ECHO and COOKIE-ACK each other.  
       
     
                    CN                    MN 
                     |                     | 
                     |        INIT         | 
                     |-------------------->| 
                     |                     | 
                     |      INIT-ACK       | 
                     |<--------------------| 
                     |                     | 
                     |     COOKIE-ECHO     | 
                     |-------------------->| 
                     |                     | 
                     |     COOKIE-ACK      | 
                     |<--------------------| 
     
                  Figure 1. SCTP Initialization 
     
    As shown in the figure, the establishment of an SCTP association is 
    ready by exchanging INIT and INIT-ACK and completed by exchanging 
    COOKIE-ECHO and COOKIE-ACK between CN and MN. 
     
    In Mobile IP, the HA will have information on the current location 
    of an MN, which is updated by Registration or Binding Update 
    procedures of the MN located at a foreign link. The location 
    management of Mobile IP can be used to convey the INIT chunk 
    message of CN to the MN via HA.  
     
    After receiving the INIT chunk, the MN responds with INIT-ACK chunk 
    directly to CN (not by way of HA) so as to complete the initiation 
    of SCTP association. The responding INIT-ACK must contain the CCoA 
    (in MIPv4) or CoA (in MIPv6), which can be addressable to the MN.

 3.2 Usage Scenarios for SCTP over Mobile IPv4 
     
    Mobile IPv4 considers two options to represent the location of the 
    foreign link: CoA and CCoA. The CoA is the IP address of FA 
    (possibly a router), whereas the CCoA is dynamically assigned by 
    using an address allocation mechanism such as DHCP. 
     
    Unfortunately, the CoA in MIPv4 cannot be applicable to SCTP, since 
    it is an address of FA and thus cannot be used within the MN host 
    (for its SCTP association). Note that SCTP is an end-to-end 
    transport layer protocol, not a network-layer one. On the other 
    hand, the CCoA in MIPv4 can be used within the SCTP hosts. 
    Specifically, the SCTP of MN could bind the CCoA to an SCTP 
    association. For this reason, in this document, we focus on the use 
    of SCTP over MIPv4 for the MN hosts with CCoA in a foreign link. 
    The case of using CoA is for further study. 
     
    Let us consider an example of MIPv4 networks, which consists of CN, 
    MN and HA. The MN is now at Location A (a foreign link), and will 
    then move into Location B, as shown in Figure 2.

 3.2.1 SCTP Association Initiation 
     
    We assume that the MN has already obtained a CCoA ([2.2.2.2]) from 
    the DHCP server attached to AR1, and also registered the CCoA with 
    HA by using the MIPv4 Registration Procedures. 
     
    We also assume that the applications of MN can initially bind the 
    CCoA as well as HoA via the socket interface. After initialization 
    of SCTP association, the HoA may be released from the application, 
    as described below. It is noted that the HoA will still be used for 
    MN to update its new CCoAs to HA according to the MIPv4 mechanisms. 
     
    Now the CN initiates an SCTP association with the MN by sending 
    INIT chunk message over HoA ([1.1.1.2]). The INIT chunk will first 
    be routed to HA, and the HA then forwards the INIT chunk to MN by 
    referring to CCoA ([2.2.2.2]) and using a tunneling mechanism.

              Figure 3. SCTP Initiation in SCTP with MIPv4 
     
    In response to the INIT chunk, the MN sends INIT-ACK chunk to the 
    CN. The INIT-ACK contains the CCoA address (as the Primary address) 
    and HoA address. Here, the HoA address may only be used for the CN 
    to check whether the responding MN is the authorized host or not 
    (for somewhat security reason). In fact, the HoA will not be 
    referred to by CN (see the Section 4 for more detailed discussion). 
    The source address and destination address of IP packet containing 
    the INIT chunk are CCoA [2.2.2.2] and CN [1.1.1.2], respectively. 
     
    In turn, the COOKIE-ECHO and COOKIE-ACK chunks will be exchanged 
    between CN and MN. Then an SCTP association has been established 
    between CN and MN.

 3.2.2 Data Transport and Handover during the Association 
  
    After the association is established, the CN transmits data chunks 
    to MN over the CCoA address, and the MN sends data chunks to CN 
    directly. 
     
    When the MN moves from Location A to Location B, the MN gets a new 
    CCoA address [3.3.3.2] from Location B. According to the MIPv4 
    mechanism, the MN will update its new location to HA, which is done 
    in the Mobile IP layer regardless of the on-going SCTP association.  
     
    On the other hand, the MN will perform the seamless handover, as it 
    moves into a new IP subnet area, according to the mobile SCTP by 
    adding the new IP address to the on-going association, as described 
    in 2.2.1. These procedures will be repeated until the association 
    has been completed. 
     
  
 3.3 Usage Scenarios for SCTP with Mobile IPv6 
  
    The usage scenarios for SCTP with MIPv6 are similar to those for 
    SCTP with MIPv4 that are described so far. 
     
    In MIPv6, the CoA is used instead of CCoA in MIPv4. The CoA may be 
    obtained from the foreign location via DHCPv6 or stateless address 
    auto-configuration. 
  
  
 3.4 Comparison of SCTP/MIP with MIP only 
  
    This section discusses comparison of SCTP/MIP with the MIP-only 
    scheme. Again, this comparison is valid for the mobile sessions 
    that are initiated by CN toward to MN. 
     
 3.4.1 Requirements for SCTP over Mobile IP  
     
    The requirement for using SCTP over Mobile IP is that the CN and MN 
    hosts must be aware of the mobile SCTP. In addition, the MN must be 
    able to bind the CoA as well as HoA to its applications. In MIP, 
    only HoA is bound to the applications of MN. 
     
 3.4.2 Route Optimization  
  
    The SCTP intrinsically provides the route optimization for data 
    transport between CN and MN. No additional route optimization 
    procedures are required, differently from MIPv4. No binding update 
    between MN and CN is needed, differently from MIPv6. As a result, 
    the tunneling of data packets between HA and MN is not required too.

 4. Further Issues to be considered 
  
    In the proposed scheme for use of SCTP over MIP, the home address 
    (HoA) of MN is not involved in the data transport between CN and MN. 
    The reason for this is to exploit the intrinsic route optimization 
    feature of mobile SCTP. Note that the additional tunneling or 
    binding update procedures are required in case that the HoA is used 
    in the SCTP association. 
     
    The HoA may be used as a backup IP address in the event of path 
    failure of the primary address, CCoA or CoA. This is for further 
    study. 
  
  
 5. Security Considerations  
  
    This document discusses the use of mobile SCTP for IP mobility 
    support. The concerned security issues will be identified as the 
    further works go on.
