1. Summary

   This document provides an implementation report for these two
   documents: "Cooperative Route Filtering Capability for BGP-4" [1],
   and "Address Prefix Based Outbound Route Filter for BGP-4" [2].  Each
   response is listed. The editor makes no claim as to the accuracy of
   the information provided.

   The following organizations reported having implementations of the
   drafts: Cisco Systems, IP Infusion, and Redback Networks.


2. Implementation Forms


2.1. Cisco Systems

   Person filling out this form:

       Keyur Patel (keyupate@cisco.com)

   Implementation (software version):

       IOS 12.2S and beyond

   List the ORF types that are implemented in your implementation:

       a) communities ORF:            No
       b) extended communities ORF:   Yes
       c) prefix ORF:                 Yes


   Does your implementation follow the normal procedures for handling a
   ROUTE-REFRESH request that does not carry ORF entries?

       Yes

   Does your implementation defer route advertisements as specified in
   the specification after receiving ORF entries with "when-to-refresh"
   set to DEFER?

       Yes

   How does your implementation handle route advertisements after
   receiving ORF entries with "when-to-refresh" set to IMMEDIATE?

       a) re-advertise all routes in the Adj-RIB-OUT for the AFI/SAFI
          (i.e., follow the normal ROUTE-REFRESH procedure), but take

          the ORF entries into account.

                 Yes

       b) maintain extra state and do not re-advertise the routes that
          have not been effected by the ORF entries, as suggested by
          the specification.

                 No


   Does your implementation follow all other procedures specified in the
   Operation Section of the specification?

       Yes

   Has there been any interoperability testing? List the ORF types
   tested.

       No

   Are there parts of the specification that are unclear where the
   implementor had to exercise some judgment that may impact the
   implementation and/or interoperability?

       a) ORF base spec:    No

       b) Prefix-ORF spec:  No
