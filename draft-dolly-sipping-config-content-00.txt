1.  Introduction

   This document defines the data content for providing profile data to
   SIP user agents in support of the framework defined in
   I-D.ietf-sipping-config-framework-02.txt [6].  The current framework
   draft identifies two types of profiles, defined as "user" and
   "device".  It is anticipated, per discussion at the previous meeting,
   that the draft 03 version will define a profile for "environment".

   The profile delivery framework is intended to enable a first phase
   migration to a standard means of providing profiles to SIP user
   agents.  It is expected that UA vendors willbe able to use this
   framework as a means of delivering their existing proprietary user
   and device data profiles.

2.  Overview

   The three types of content to be defined are user, device and
   environment.  The profile delivery server will provide the content or
   URI(s) associated with the user and device profiles.  The environment
   profile is optional and its content will be provided by the local
   domain serving the SIP User Agent.

   The content of the device profile is a function of the vnedor, model,
   and version parameters associted with the device, whoch are specified
   by the vendor of the user agent.  THese parameters allow the profile
   delivery server to provide different profiles based upon these
   variables.

   As noted in the framework, a default user maybe assigned to a device.
   In this scenario the profile delivery server may provide the URI(s)
   in the NOTIFY request for the default user when subscribing to the
   device profile type.  Effectively the device profile type becomes a
   superset of the user profile subscription.  The user type is still
   useful in this scenario to allow the user agent to obtain profile
   data or URI(s) for a user other than the default user.  This provides
   the ability to support a hoteling function where a user may "login"
   to a local domain and obtain the content of the environment profile.

3.  Data Content

   The contributor WILL provide descriptive text for the content items
   in the next revision.

3.1  User Data

   Elements of the User Data include:

   	Proxy and Registration Server URIs
   	Preloaded Route Sets
   	User Address of Record and Display Name
   	User Authentication Information and Other Credentials
   	Privacy Settings
   	Pre Media Configuration Parameters (e.g., Audio Configuration)
   	Dial Plan
   	Progess Tone Settings
   	ENUM Settings
   	International Settings
   	Call Forwarding and Redirection Settings
   	Speed Dial Settings
   	Local Control Feature Settings (e.g., transfer, conference)
      Alert Settings, including pre-caller alerting
      URIs and timers for additional profile configuration
      Logging Settings


3.2  Device Data

   Elements of the Device Data include:

   	Firmware Upgrade
   	SIP Timer Values
   	Response Status Code Handling
   	RTP Parameters
   	SDP Payload Types
   	Audio Configurations
   	Firewall and NAT Support Parameters
   	Manual Network Addressing
   	Local Administration Settings


3.3  Environment Data

   The environment data may be inputed by the subscriber or the local
   access domain.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document introduces no requirements for IANA.

5.  Security Considerations

   Profiles may contain sensitive data such as user credentials.  The
   protection of this data depends upon how the data is delivered.  If
   the data is delivered in the NOTIFY body, SIP authentication MUST be
   used for SUBSCRIPTION and SIPS and/or S/MIME MAY be used to encrypt

   the data.  If the data is provided via content indirection, SIP
   authentication is not necessary for the SUBSCRIBE request.  With
   content indirection the data is protected via the authentication,
   authorization and encryption mechanisms provided by the profile URL
   scheme.  Use of the URL scheme security mechanisms via content
   indirection simpifies the security solution as the SIP event package
   does not need to authenticate, authorize or protect the contents of
   the SIP messages.  Effectively the profile delivery server will
   provide profile URL(s) to anyone.  The URLs themselves are protected
   via authentication, authorization and snooping (e.g., via HTTPS).

6.  Open Issues

   This section identifies issues yet to be addressed.

7.  Change History

   This section identifies changes to the document per draft revision.

8.  Examples

   This section is informative in nature.  If there is a discrepancy
   between this section and the normative sections above, the normative
   sections take precedence.
