         Analysis of Use Cases and Gaps in Technology for I2NSF
             draft-hares-i2nsf-use-case-gap-analysis-00.txt

Abstract

   This document provides a summary of the I2NSF use cases plus a
   summary of the stat of the art in industries and IETF work which is
   relevant to the Interface to Network Security Function (I2NSF).  The
   I2NSF focus is to define data models and interfaces in order to
   control and monitor the physical and virtual aspects of network
   security functions.  The use cases are organized in two basic
   scenarios.  In the access network scenario, mobile and residential
   users access NSF capabilities using their network service provider
   infrastructure.  In the data center scenario customers manage NSFs
   hosted in the data center infrastructure.

1.  Introduction

   Enterprise, residential, and mobile customers are becoming more and
   more aware of the need for network security, just to find that
   security services are hard to operate and become expensive in the
   case of reasonably sophisticated ones.  This general trend has caused
   numerous operators and security vendors to start to leverage on
   cloud-based models to deliver security solutions.  In particular, the
   methods around Network Function Virtualization (NFV) are meant to
   facilitate the elastic deployment of software images providing the
   network services, and require the management of various resources by
   customers, who may not own or physically host those network
   functions.

   There are numerous benefits by defining such interfaces.  Operators
   could provide more flexible and customized security services for
   specific users and this would provide more efficient and secure
   protection to each user.

   This document provides an analysis of the use cases, gaps analysis of
   existing technology, recommendations for requirements for I2NSF, and
   security considerations.

1.1.  What is I2NSF

   A Network Security Function (NSF) is a function used to ensure
   integrity, confidentiality, or availability of network
   communications, to detect unwanted network activity, or to block or
   at least mitigate the effects of unwanted activity.  NSFs are
   provided and consumed in increasingly diverse environments.  Users
   could consume network security services enforced by NSFs hosted by
   one or more providers - which may be their own enterprise, service
   providers, or a combination of both.  Similarly, service providers
   may offer their customers network security services that are enforced
   by multiple security products, functions from different vendors, or
   open source technologies.  NSFs may be provided by physical and/or
   virtualized infrastructure.  Without standard interfaces to control
   and monitor the behavior of NSFs, it has become virtually impossible
   for providers of security services to automate service offerings that
   utilize different security functions from multiple vendors.

1.2.  I2NSF Standarization

   The Interface to NSF devices (I2NSF) work proposes to standardize a
   set of software interfaces and data modules to control and monitor
   the physical and virtual NSFs.  Since different security vendors
   support different features and functions, the I2NSF will focus on the
   flow-based NSFs that provide treatment to packets or flows such found

   in IPS/IDS devices, web filtering devices, flow filtering devices,
   deep packet inspection devices, pattern matching inspection devices,
   and re-mediation devices.

   There are two layers of interfaces envisioned in the I2NSF approach:

   o  The I2NSF Capability Layer specifies how to control and monitor
      NSFs at a functional implementation level.  This the focus for
      this phase of the I2NSF Work.

   o  The I2NSF Service Layer defines how the security policies of
      clients may be expressed and monitored.

   For the I2NSF capability layer, the I2NSF work proposes an
   interoperable protocol that passes NSF provisioning rules and
   orchestration information between I2NSF client on a network manager
   and I2NSF agent on an NSF device.  It is envisioned that clients of
   the I2NSF interfaces include management applications, service
   orchestration systems, network controllers, or user applications that
   may solicit network security resources.

   The I2NSF work to define this protocol includes the following work:

   o  defining an informational model that defines the concepts for
      standardizing the control and monitoring of NSFs,

   o  defining a set of Yang data models from the information model that
      identifies the data that must be passed,

   o  creating a capability registry (an IANA registry) that identifies
      the characteristics and behaviours of NSFs in vendor-neutral
      vocabulary without requiring the NSFs to be standardized.

   o  examining existing secure communication mechanisms to identify the
      appropriate ones for carrying the data that provisions and
      monitors information between the NSFs and their management entity
      (or entities).

1.3.  Structure of the document

   This document reviews the terminology (section 3), analyzes the use
   cases (section 4) and gaps in current technology (section 5),
   recommends certain requirements for I2NSF protocol(section 6), and
   discusses security consideration (section 8).

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation
   only when in ALL CAPS.  Lower case uses of these words are not to be
   interpreted as carrying RFC-2119 significance.

3.  Terminology

   o  Network Security Function (NSF): A functional block within a
      network infrastructure to ensure integrity, confidentiality and
      availability of network communications, to detect unwanted
      activity, and to deter and block this unwanted activity or at
      least mitigate its effects on the network

   o  vNSF: Virtual Network Security Function: A network security
      function that runs as a software image on a virtualized
      infrastructure, and can be requested by one domain but may be
      owned or managed by another domain.

   o  type of NSFs: NSFs considered in this draft include virtualized
      and non-virtualized NSFs.

   o  Cloud DC: A data center that is not on premises of enterprises,
      but has compute/storage resources that can be requested or
      purchased by the enterprises.  The enterprise is actually getting
      a virtual data center.  The Cloud Security Alliance (CSA)
      (http://cloudsecurityalliance.org) focus on adding security to
      this environment.  A specific research topic is security as a
      service within the cloud data center.

   o  Cloud-based security functions: Network Security Function (NSF)
      hosted and managed by service providers or different
      administrative entity.

   o  DC: Data Center

   o  Domain: The term Domain in this draft has the following different
      connotations in different scenarios:

      *  Client--Provider relationship, i.e. client requesting some
         network security functions from its provider;






Hares, et al.            Expires April 20, 2016                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft        I2NSF Existing Work Analysis          October 2015


      *  Domain A - Domain B relationship, i.e. one operator domain
         requesting some network security functions from another
         operator domain; or

      *  Applications -- Network relationship, i.e. an application (e.g.
         cluster of servers) requesting some functions from network,
         etc.

      The domain context is important because it indicates the
      interactions the security is focused on.

   o  I2NSF agent - a piece of software in a device that implements a
      network security function which receives provisioning information
      and requests for operational data (monitoring data) across the
      I2NSF protocol from an I2NSF client.

   o  I2NSF client - A security client software that utilizes the I2NSF
      protocol to read, write or change the provisioning network
      security device via software interface using the I2NSF protocol
      (denoted as I2RS Agent)

   o  I2NSF Management System - I2NSF client operates within an network
      management system which serves as a collections and distribution
      point for security provisioning and filter data.  This management
      system is denoted as I2NS management system in this document.

   o  Virtual Security Function: a security function that can be
      requested by one domain but may be owned or managed by another
      domain.

4.  Use Cases

   This section discusses general use cases, access use cases, and cloud
   use cases.

4.1.  General Use Cases

   User request security services through specific clients (a customer
   app, the NSP BSS/OSS or management platform...) and the appropriate
   NSP network entity will invoke the (v)NSFs according to the user
   service request.  We will call this network entity the security
   controller.  The interaction between the entities discussed above
   (client, security controller, NSF) is shown in the following diagram:

                             +----------+
      +-------+              |          |                  +-------+
      |       |  Interface 1 |Security  |   Interface 2    | NSF(s)|
      |Client <------------->           <------------------>       |
      |       |              |Controller|                  |       |
      +-------+              |          |                  +-------+
                             +----------+

                     Figure 2: Interaction between Entities

   Interface 1 is used for receiving security requirements from client
   and translating them into commands that NSFs can understand and
   execute.  Moreover, it is also responsible for giving feedback of the
   NSF security statistics to client.  Interface 2 is used for
   interacting with NSFs according to commands, and collect status
   information about NSFs.

4.1.1.  Instantiation and Configuration of NSFs

   Client sends collected security requirements through Interface 1 to
   the security controller in the NSP network, which then translates
   them into a a set of security functions.  Then the corresponding NSFs
   are instantiated and configured through Interface 2.

   As an example, consider an enterprise user A who wants to prevent a
   certain kind of traffic from flowing to their network.  Such a
   requirement is sent from client to security controller through
   Interface 1.  The security controller translates the requirement into
   a firewall function plus a rules for filtering out TCP and/or UDP
   data packets.  Then it instantiates a firewall NSF through Interface
   2.  The corresponding filter rules are also configured onto this
   firewall NSF through Interface 2.

4.1.2.  Updating of NSFs

   A user can direct the client to require the update of security
   service functions, including adding/deleting a security service
   function and updating configurations of former security service
   function.

   As an example, consider a user who has instantiated a security
   service before and decides to enable an additional IDS service.  This
   requirement will be sent to the security controller through Interface
   1 and be translated, so the security controller instantiates and
   configures an IDS NSF through Interface 2.

Internet-Draft        I2NSF Existing Work Analysis          October 2015


4.1.3.  Collecting the Status of NSFs

   When users want to get the executing status of security service, they
   can request the status statistics information of NSFs from the
   client.  The security controller will collect NSF status statistics
   information through Interface 2, consolidate them, and give feedback
   to client through Interface 1.  This interface can be used to collect
   not only individual service information, but also aggregated data
   suitable for tasks like infrastructure security assessment.

4.1.4.  Validation of NSFs

   Customers may require to validate NSF availability, provenance, and
   its correct execution.  This validation process, especially relevant
   for vNSFs, includes at least

      Integrity of the NSF.  Ensure that the NSF is not manipulated.

      Isolation.  The execution of the NSF is self-contained for privacy
      requirements in multi-tenancy scenarios.

   In order to achieve this the security controller has to collect
   security measurements and share them with an independent and trusted
   third party, allowing the user to attest the NSF by using Interface 1
   and the information of the trusted third party.

4.2.  Access Networks

   This scenario describes use cases for users (enterprise user, network
   administrator, residential user...) that request and manage security
   services hosted in the network service provider (NSP) infrastructure.
   Given that NSP customers are essentially users of their access
   networks, the scenario is essentially associated with their
   characteristics, as well as with the use of vNSFs.

   The Virtual CPE described in [NFVUC] use cases #5 and #7 cover the
   model of virtualization for mobile and residential access, where the
   operator may offload security services from the customer local
   environment (or even the terminal) to the operator infrastructure
   supporting the access network.

   These use cases defines the operator interaction with vNSFs through
   automated interfaces, typically by B2B communications performed by
   the operator management systems (OSS/BSS).

4.2.1.  vNSF Deployment

   The deployment process consists of instantiating a NSF on a
   Virtualization Infrastructure (NFVI), within the NSP administrative
   domain(s) or with other external domain(s).  This is a required step
   before a customer can subscribe to a security service supported in
   the vNSF.

4.2.2.  vNSF Customer Provisioning

   Once a vNSF is deployed, any customer can subscribe to it.  The
   provisioning lifecycle includes:

      Customer enrollment and cancellation of the subscription to a
      vNSF.

      Configuration of the vNSF, based on specific configurations, or
      derived from common security policies defined by the NSP.

      Retrieve and list of the vNSF functionalities, extracted from a
      manifest or a descriptor.  The NSP management systems can demand
      this information to offer detailed information through the
      commercial channels to the customer.

4.3.  Cloud Datacenter Scenario

   In a datacenter, network security mechanisms such as firewalls may
   need to be added or removed dynamically for a number of reasons.  It
   may be explicitly requested by the user, or triggered by a pre-
   agreed-upon service level agreement (SLA) between the user and the
   provider of the service.  For example, the service provider may be
   required to add more firewall capacity within a set timeframe
   whenever the bandwidth utilization hits a certain threshold for a
   specified period.  This capacity expansion could result in adding new
   instances of firewalls.  Likewise, a service provider may need to
   provision a new firewall instance in a completely new environment due
   to a new requirement.

   The on-demand, dynamic nature of deployment essentially requires that
   the network security "devices" be in software or virtual form
   factors, rather than in a physical appliance form.  (This is a
   provider-side concern.  Users of the firewall service are agnostic,
   as they should, as to whether or not the firewall service is run on a
   VM or any other form factor.  Indeed, they may not even be aware that
   their traffic traverses firewalls.)

   Furthermore, new firewall instances need to be placed in the "right
   zone" (domain).  The issue applies not only to multi-tenant



Hares, et al.            Expires April 20, 2016                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft        I2NSF Existing Work Analysis          October 2015


   environments where getting the tenant right is of paramount
   importance but also to environments owned and operated by a single
   organization with its own service segregation policies.  For example,
   an enterprise may mandate that firewalls serving Internet traffic and
   business-to-business (B2B) traffic be separate; or that IPS/IDS
   services for investment banking and non-banking traffic be separate
   for regulatory reasons.

4.3.1.  On-Demand Virtual Firewall Deployment

   A service provider operated cloud data center could serve tens of
   thousands of clients.  Clients' compute servers are typically hosted
   on virtual machines (VMs), which could be deployed across different
   server racks located in different parts of the data center.  It is
   often not technically and/or financially feasible to deploy dedicated
   physical firewalls to suit each client's myriad security policy
   requirements.  What is needed is the ability to dynamically deploy
   virtual firewalls for each client's set of servers based on
   established security policies and underlying network topologies.

4.3.2.  Firewall Policy Deployment Automation

   Firewall configuration today is a highly complex process that
   involves consulting established security policies, translating those
   policies into firewall rules, further translating those rules into
   vendor-specific configuration sets, identifying all the firewalls,
   and pushing configurations to those firewalls.

   This is often a time consuming, complex and error-prone process even
   within a single organization/enterprise framework.  It becomes far
   more complex in provider-owned cloud networks that serve myriad
   customers.

Internet-Draft        I2NSF Existing Work Analysis          October 2015


   Automation can help address many of these issues.  Automation works
   best when it can leverage a common set of standards that will work
   across multiple entities.

4.3.2.1.  Client-Specific Security Policy in Cloud VPNs

   Clients of service provider operated cloud data centers need not only
   secure virtual private networks (VPNs) but also virtual security
   functions that enforce the clients' security policies.  The security
   policies may govern communications within the clients' own virtual
   networks and those with external networks.  For example, VPN service
   providers may need to provide firewall and other security services to
   their VPN clients.  Today, it is generally not possible for clients
   to dynamically view, much less change, what, where and how security
   policies are implemented on their provider-operated clouds.  Indeed,
   no standards-based framework that allows clients to retrieve/manage
   security policies in a consistent manner across different providers
   exists.

4.4.  Considerations on Policy and Configuration

   NSF configurations can vary from simple rules (i.e. block a DDoS
   attack) to very complex configuration ( i.e. define a user firewall
   rules per application, protocol, source and destination port and
   address).  The possibility of using configuration templates per
   control and management type is a common option as well.

   A NSP can push security policies using complex configurations in
   their managed vNSF through its management system.  The open Control
   and management interface has to accommodate this application-driven
   behavior.

   Computer-savvy customers may pursue a similar application-driven
   configuration through the open Control and management interface, but
   standard residential and mobile customers may prefer to use the
   definition of security policies in the form of close-to-natural-
   language sentences with high-level directives or a guide
   configuration process.  The representation for these policies will be
   of the form:

      +-------+   +------+   +------+   +------------------+
      |Subject| + |Action| + |Object| + |Field_type = Value|
      +-------+   +------+   +------+   +------------------+


           Figure 4: High-Level Security Policy Format

   Subject indicates the customer or device in the access.



Hares, et al.            Expires April 20, 2016                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft        I2NSF Existing Work Analysis          October 2015


   Action can include a variety of intent-based actions: check,
   redirect, allow, block, record, inspect..

   Object can be optional and specifies the nature of the action.  The
   default is all the customer traffic, but others possible values are
   connections and connections attempts.

   Field_type allows to create fine-grained policies, including
   destinations list (i.e.  IPs, domains), content types (i.e. files,
   emails), windows of time (i.e. weekend), protocol or network service
   (i.e.  HTTP).

   An example of a customer policy is:

      "My son is allowed to access Facebook from 18:30 to 20:00"

4.4.1.  Translating Policies into NSF Capabilities

   Policies expressed in the above model are suitable for what we
   depicted as Interface 1 in Figure 2.  In order to allow the security
   controller to deal with the different NSFs an intermediate
   representation used for expressing specific configurations in a
   device-independent format is required.  For this purpose, the
   definition of a set of security capabilities provides a means for
   categorizing the actions performed by network security functions.  An
   initial, high-level set of such capabilities consists of:

   o  Identity Management: Includes all services related with identity,
      authentication and key management.  Some examples are:

      *  AAA (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting) services

      *  Remote identity management

      *  Remote identity management

   o  Traffic Inspection: A common use case for customers accessing the
      Internet or additional services through it is security
      supervision.  Control and Management interfaces will allow the
      configuration of the vNSF inspection features: signatures updates,
      behavioral parameters or type of traffic to supervise.  Some
      examples are:

      *  IDS/IPS (Intrusion Detection System/Intrusion Prevention
         System,

      *  Deep packet inspection,




Hares, et al.            Expires April 20, 2016                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft        I2NSF Existing Work Analysis          October 2015


      *  Data leakage protection,

   o  Traffic Manipulation: A more intrusive use case of NSF includes
      the capacity of manipulate the client traffic.  Control and
      Management interfaces will allow the configuration of the NSF
      manipulation features, such as redirect and block rules.  Some
      examples are:

      *  Redirect traffic, as in the case of captive portals,

      *  Block traffic: Firewalls, intrusion prevention system, DDOS/
         Anti-DOS (Distributed Denial-of-Service/Anti-Denial-of-
         Service),

      *  Encrypt traffic: VPN services that encapsulate and encrypt the
         user traffic.  A SSL VPN is a representative example.

   o  Impersonation:Some NSFs can impersonate a customer service or
      Internet service to provide security functions.  Control and
      Management interfaces will allow the configuration of the service
      to impersonate and his behavioral.  Some examples are:

      *  Honeypots, impersonating customer services, such as HTTP,
         NetBios or SSH,

      *  Anonymization services, hiding the source identity, as in the
         case of TOR.

   Service Chain will allow for more than one of the aforementioned
   functions to engage in a specific order to a particular flow

      In-Depth Review of Some IETF Protocols (section 5.7)

5.2.  IETF Gap analysis

   The IETF gap analysis first examines the IETF mechanisms which have
   been developed to secure the IP traffic flows through a network.
   Traffic filters have been defined by IETF specifications at the
   access points, the middle-boxes, or the routing systems.  Protocols
   have been defined to carry provisioning and filtering traffic between
   a management system and an IP system (router or host system).
   Current security work (SACM working group (WG), MILE WG, and DOTS WG)
   is providing correlation of events monitored with the policy set by
   filters.  This section provides a review the filter work, protocols,
   and security correlation for monitors.

5.2.1.  Traffic Filters

5.2.1.1.  Overview

   The earliest filters defined by IETF were access filters which
   controlled the acceptance of IP packet data flows.  Additional policy
   filters were created as part of the following protocols:

   o  COPS protocol [RFC2748] for controlling access to networks,

   o  Next steps in Signalling (NSIS) work (architecture: [RFC4080]
      protocol: [RFC5973]), and

   o  the Port Control Protocol (PCP) to enables IPv4 to IPv6 flexible
      address and port mapping for NATs and Firewalls,

   Today NETMOD and I2RS Working groups are specifying additional
   filters in Yang modules to be used as part of the NETCONF or I2RS
   enhancement of NETCONF/RESTCONF.

   The routing filtering is outside the scope of the flow filtering, but
   flow filtering may be impacted by route filtering.  An initial model
   for the routing policy is in [I-D.shaikh-rtgwg-policy-model]

   This section provides an overview of the flow filtering as an
   introduction to the I2NSF GAP analysis.  Additional detail on
   NETCONF, NETMOD, I2RS, PCP, and NSIS is available in the Detailed
   I2NSF analysis.

5.2.1.1.1.  Data Flow Filters in NETMOD and I2RS

   The current work on expanding these filters is focused oncombining a
   configuration and monitoring protocol with Yang data models.
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-acl-model] provides a set of access lists filters
   which can permit or deny traffic flow based on headers at the MAC, IP
   layer, and Transport layer.  The configuration and monitoring
   protocols which can pass the filters are: NETCONF protocol [RFC6241],
   RESTCONF [I-D.ietf-netconf-restconf], and the I2RS protocol.  The
   NETCONF and RESTCONF protocols install these filters into forwarding
   tables.  The I2RS protocol uses the ACLs as part of the filters
   installed in an ephemeral protocol-independent filter-based RIB
   [I-D.kini-i2rs-fb-rib-info-model] which controls the flow of traffic
   on interfaces specifically controlled by the I2RS filter-based FIB.

                         netconf
      +---------------+    /  \     +---------------+
      | Device: ACLs  |-- /     \---|Device: ACLS   |
      | I2RS FB RIB   |             | I2RS FB RIB   |
      |routing policy |             | routing policy|
      |               |             |               |
   ===|===============|=============|===============|=
      +---------------+  data flow  +---------------+

           Figure 5 -I2RS Filter-Based RIB

   The I2RS protocol is a programmatic interface to the routing system.
   At this time, the I2RS is targeted to be extensions to the NETCONF/
   RESTCONF protocols to allow the NETCONF/RESTCONF protocol to support
   a highly programmatic interface with high bandwidth of data, highly
   reliable notifications, and ephemeral state (see
   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture]).  Please see the background section on
   I2RS for additional details on the requirements for this extension to
   the NETCONF/RESTCONF protocol suite.

   The vocabulary set in [I-D.ietf-netmod-acl-model] is limited, so
   additional protocol independent filters were written for the I2RS
   Filter-Based RIBs in [I-D.hares-i2rs-bnp-eca-data-model], and
   protocol specific filters for SFC
   [I-D.dunbar-i2rs-discover-traffic-rules].

   One thing important to note is that NETCONF and RESTCONF manage
   device layer yang models.  However, as figure 6 shows, there are
   multiple device level, network-wide level, and application level yang
   modules.  The access lists defined by the device level forwarding
   table may be impacted by the routing protocols, the I2RS ephemeral
   protocol independent Filter-Based FIB, or some network-wide security
   issue (IPS/IDS).

5.2.1.1.2.  I2NSF Gap analysis

   The gap is that none of the current work on these filters considers
   all the variations of data necessary to do IPS/IDS, web-filters,
   stateful flow-based filtering, security-based deep packet inspection,
   or pattern matching with re-mediation.  The I2RS Filter-Based RIB
   work is the closest associated work, but the focus has not been on
   IDS/IPS, web-filters, security-based deep packet inspection, or
   pattern matching with re-mediation.

   The I2RS Working group (I2RS WG) is focused on the routing system so
   security expertise for these IDP/IPS, Web-filter, security-based
   deep-packet inspection has not been targeted for this WG.

   Another gap is there is no capability registry (an IANA registry)
   that identifies the characteristics and behaviours of NSFs in vendor-
   neutral vocabulary without requiring the NSFs to be standardized.

   What I2NSF can use from NETCONF/RESTCONF and I2RS

   I2NSF should consider using NETCONF/RESTCONF protocol and the I2RS
   proposed enhancement to the NETCONF/RESTCONF protocol.

5.2.1.2.  Middle-box Filters

5.2.1.2.1.  Midcom

   Midcom Summary: MIDCOM developed the protocols for applications to
   communicate with middle boxes.  However, MIDCOM have not used by the
   industry for a long time.  This is because there was a lot of IPR



Hares, et al.            Expires April 20, 2016                [Page 17]

Internet-Draft        I2NSF Existing Work Analysis          October 2015


   encumbered technology and IPR was likely a bigger problem for IETF
   than it is today.  MIDCOM is not specific to SIP.  It was very much
   oriented to NAT/FW devices.  SIP was just one application that needed
   the functionality.  MIDCOM is reservation-oriented and there was an
   expectation that the primary deployment environment would be VoIP and
   real-time conferencing, including SIP, H.323, and other reservation-
   oriented protocols.  There was an assumption that there would be some
   authoritative service that would have a view into endpoint sessions
   and be able to authorize (or not) resource allocation requests.  In
   other word, there's a trust model there that may not be applicable to
   endpoint-driven requests without some sort of trusted authorization
   mechanisms/tools.  Therefore, there is a specific information model
   applied to security devices, and security device requests, that was
   developed in the context of an SNMP MIB.  There is also a two-stage
   reservation model, which was specified in order to allow better
   resource management.

   Why I2NSF is different than Midcom

   MIDCOM is different than I2NSF because its SNMP scheme doesn't work
   with the virtual network security functions (vNSF) management.

   MidCom RFCs:

      [RFC3303] - Midcom architecture

      [RFC5189] - Midcom Protocol Semantics

      [RFC3304] - Midcom protocol requirements

5.2.1.3.  Security Work

5.2.1.3.1.  Overview

   Today's NSFs in security devices can handle flow-based security by
   providing treatment to packets/flows, such as IPS/IDS, Web filtering,
   flow filtering, deep packet inspection, or pattern matching and re-
   mediation.  These flow-based security devices are managed and
   provisioned by network management systems.

   No standardized set of interoperable interfaces control and manage
   the NSFs so that a central management system can be used across
   security devices from multiple Vendors.  I2NSF work plan is to
   standardize a set of interfaces by which control and management of
   NSFs may be invoked, operated, and monitored by:

      creating an information model that defines concepts required for
      standardizing the control and monitoring of NSFs, and from the

      information model create data models.  (The information model will
      be used to get early agreement on key technical points.)

      creating a capability registry (at IANA) that enables the
      characteristics and behavior of NSFs to be specified using a
      vendor-neutral vocabulary without requiring the NSFs themselves to
      be standardized.

      define the requirements for an I2NSF protocol to pass this
      traffic.  (Hopefully re-using existing protocols.)

   The flow-filtering configuration and management must fit into the
   existing security area's work plan.  This section considers how the
   I2NSF fits into the security area work under way in the SACM
   (security automation and control), DOTS (DDoS Open Threat
   Signalling), and MILE (Management Incident Lightweight Exchange).

5.2.1.3.2.  Security Work and Filters

   In the proposed I2NSF work plan, the I2NSF security network
   management system controls many NSF nodes via the I2NSF Agent.  This
   control of data flows is similar to the COPS example in section
   5.7.4.

   The other security protocols work to interact within the network to
   provide additional information in the following way:

   o  SACM [I-D.ietf-sacm-architecture] describes an architecture which
      tries to determine if the end-point security policies and the
      reality (denoted as security posture) align.

Internet-Draft        I2NSF Existing Work Analysis          October 2015


      [I-D.ietf-sacm-terminology] defines posture as the configuration
      and/or status of hardware or software on an endpoint as it
      pertains to an organization's security policy.  Filters can be
      considered on the configuration or status pieces that needs to be
      monitored.

   o  DOTS (DDoS Open Threat Signalling) - is working on coordinating
      the mitigation of DDoS attacks.  A part of DDoS attach mitigation
      is to provide lists of addresses to be filtered via IP header
      filters.

   o  MILE (Managed Incident LIghtweight Exchange) - is working on
      creating a standardized format for incident and indicator reports,
      and creating a protocol to transport this information.  The
      incident information MILE collects may cause changes in data-flow
      filters on one or more NSFs.

5.2.1.3.3.  I2NSF interaction

   The network management system that the I2NSF client resides on may
   interact with other clients or agents developed for the work ongoing
   in the SACM, DOTS, and MILES working groups.  This section describes
   how the addition of I2NSF's ability to control and monitor NSF
   devices is compatible and synergistic with these existing efforts.

   Figure 8 provides a diagram of a system the I2NSF, SACM, DOTS and
   MILES client-agent or consumer-broker-provider are deployed together.
   The following are possible positive interactions these scenario might
   have:

   o  An security network management system (NMS) can contain a SACM
      repository and be connected to SACM information provider and a
      SACM consumer.  The I2NSF may provide one of the ways to change
      the forwarding filters.

   o  The security NMS may also be connected to DOTS DDoS clients
      managing the information and configuring the rules.  The I2NSF may
      provide one of the ways to change forwarding filters.

   o  The MILES client on a security network management system talking
      to the MILES agent on the node may react to the incidents by using
      I2NSF to set filters.  DOTS creates black-lists, but does not have
      a complete set of filters.

5.2.1.3.4.  Benefits from the Interaction

   I2NSF's ability to provide a common interoperable and vendor neutral
   interface may allow the security NMS to use a single change to change
   filters.  SACM provides an information model to describe end-points,
   but does not link this directly to filters.

   DOTS creates black-lists based on source and destination IP address,
   transport port number, protocol ID, and traffic rate.  Like NETMOD's,
   ACLS are not sufficient for all filters or control desired by the NSF
   boxes.

   The incident data captured by MILES will not have enough filter
   information to provide NSF devices with general services.  The I2NSF
   will be able to handle the MILE incident data and create alerts or
   reports for other security systems.

5.3.  ETSI NFV

5.3.1.  ETSI Overview

   Network Function Virtualization (NFV) provides the service providers
   with flexibility, cost effective and agility to offer their services
   to customers.  One such service is the network security function
   which guards the exterior of a service provider or its customers.

   The flexibility and agility of NFV encourages service providers to
   provide different products to address business trends in their market
   to provide better service offerings to their end user.  A traditional
   product such as the network security function (NSF) may be broken
   into multiple virtual devices each hosted from another vendor.  In
   the past, network security devices may have been single sourced from
   a small set of vendors - but in the NFV version of NSF devices, this
   reduced set of sources will not provide a competitive edge.  Due to
   this market shift, the network security device vendors are realizing
   that the proprietary provisioning protocols and formats of data may
   be a liability.  Out of the NFV work has arisen a desire for a single
   interoperable network security device provisioning and control
   protocol.

   The I2NSF will be deployed along networks using other security and
   NFV technology.  As section 3 described, the NFV NSF security is
   deployed along side other security functions (AAA, SACM, DOTS, and
   MILE devices) or deep-packet-inspection.  The ETSI Network Functions
   Virtualization: NFV security: Security and Trust guidance document
   (ETSI NFV SEC 003 1.1.1 (2014-12)) indicates that multiple
   administrative domains will deployed in carrier networks.  One
   example of these multiple domains is hosting of multiple tenant

   domains (telecom service providers) on a single infrastructure domain
   (infrastructure service) as figure 9 shows.  The ETSI Inter inter-
   VNFM document (aka Ve-Vnfn) between the element management system and
   the Virtual network function is the equivalent of the interface
   between the I2NSF client on a management system and the I2NSF agent
   on the network security feature VNF.

Internet-Draft        I2NSF Existing Work Analysis          October 2015


   In the NFV-related productions, the current architecture does not
   have a protocol to maintain an interoperability provisioning from
   I2NSF client to I2NSF agent.  The result is that service providers
   have to manage the interoperability using private protocols.  In
   response to this problem, the device manufacturers and the service
   providers have begun to discuss an I2NSF protocol for interoperable
   passing of provisioning and filter in formation.

   Open source work (such as OPNFV) provides a common code base for
   providers to start their NFV work from.  However, this code base
   faces the same problem.  There is no defacto standard protocol.

5.4.  OPNFV

   The OPNFV (www.opnfv.org) is a carrier-grade integrated, open source
   platform focused on accelerating the introduction of new Network
   Function Virtualization (NFV) products and service.  The OPNFV Moon
   project is focused on adding the security interface for a network
   management system within the Tenant NFVs and the infrastructure NFVs
   (as shown in figure 4).  This section provides an overview of the
   OPNFV Moon project and a gap analysis between I2NSF and the OPNFV
   Moon Project.

5.4.1.  OPNFV Moon Project

   The OPNFV moon project (https://wiki.opnfv.org) is a security
   management system.  NFV uses cloud computing technologies to
   virtualize the resources and automate the control.  The Moon project
   is working on a security manager for the Cloud computing
   infrastructure (https://wiki.opnfv.org/moon).  The Moon project
   proposes to provision a set of different cloud resources/services for
   VNFs (Virtualized Network Functions) while managing the isolation of
   VNS, protection of VNFs, and monitoring of VNS.  Moon is creating a
   security management system for OPNFV with security managers to
   protect different layers of the NFV infrastructure.  The Moon project
   is choosing various security project mechanisms "a la cart" to
   enforcement related security managers.  A security management system
   integrates mechanisms of different security aspects.  This project
   will first propose a security manager that specifies users' security
   requirements.  It will also enforce the security managers through
   various mechanisms like authorization for access control, firewall
   for networking, isolation for storage, logging for tractability, etc.

   The Moon security manager operates a VNF security manager at the ETSI
   VeVnfm level where the I2NSF protocol is targeted as figure 10 shows.
   Figure 10 also shows how the OPNFV VNF Security project mixes the
   I2NSF level with the device level.

Internet-Draft        I2NSF Existing Work Analysis          October 2015


   The Moon project lists the following gaps in OpenStack:

   o  No centralized control for compute, storage, and networking.  Open
      Stack uses Nova for computing and Swift for software.  Each system
      has a configuration file and its own security policy.  This lacks
      the synchronization mechanism to build a complete secure
      configuration for OPNF.

   o  No dynamic control so that if a user obtains the token, the is no
      way to obtain control over the user.

   o  No customization or flexibility to allow integration into
      different vendors,

   o  No fine grain authorization at user level.  Authorization is only
      at the API

   Moon addresses these issues adding authorization, logging, IDS,
   enforcement of network policy, and storage protection.  Moon is based
   on OpenStack Keystone.

   Deliverable time frame: 2S 2015

5.5.1.  Overview of API for Security Group

   The security group with the security group rules provides ingress and
   egress traffic filters based on port.  The default group drops all
   ingress traffic and allows all egress traffic.  The groups with
   additional filters are added to change this behaviour.  To utilize
   the security groups, the networking plug-in for Open Stack must
   implement the security group API.  The following plug-ins in
   OpenSTsack currently implement this security: ML2, Open vSwitch,
   Linux Bridge, NEC, and VMware NSX.  In addition, the correct firewall
   driver must be added to make this functional.

5.5.2.  Overview of Firewalls as a Service

   Firewall as a service is an early release of an API that allows early
   adopters to test network implementations.  It contains APIs with
   parameters for firewall rules, firewall policies, and firewall
   identifiers.  The firewall rules include the following information:

   o  identification of rule (id, name, description)

   o  identification tenant rule associated with,

   o  links to installed firewall policy,

   o  IP protocol (tcp, udp, icmp, none)

   o  source and destination IP address

   o  source and destination port

   o  action: allow or deny traffic

   o  status: position and enable/disabled

   The firewall policies include the following information:

   o  identification of the policy (id, name, description),

   o  identification of tenant associated with,

   o  ordered list of firewall rules,

   o  indication if policy can be seen by tenants other than owner, and

   o  indication if firewall rules have been audited.

   The firewall table provides the following information:

   o  tenant associated with this firewall,

   o  administrative state (up/down),

   o  status (active, down, pending create, pending delete, pending
      update, pending error)

   o  firewall policy ID this firewall is associated with

5.5.3.  I2NSF Gap analysis

   The OpenStack work is preliminary (security groups and firewall as a
   service).  This work does not allow any of the existing network
   security vendors provide a management interface.  Security devices
   take time to be tested for functionality and their detection of
   security issues.  The OpenStack work provides an interesting simple
   set of filters, and may in the future provide some virtual filter
   service.  However, at this time this open source work does not
   address the single management interfaces for a variety of security
   devices.

   I2NSF is proposing rules that will include Event-Condition-matches
   (ECA) with the following matches

      packet based matches on L2, L3, and L4 headers and/or specific
      addresses within these headers,

      context based matches on schedule state and schedule, [Editor:
      Need more details here.]

   The I2NSF is proposing action for these ECA policies of:

      basic actions of deny, permit, and mirror,

      advanced actions of: IPS signature filtering and URL filtering.

   All of these features either require the I2NSF standardized I2NSF
   client to I2NSF agent to provide multi-vendor interoperability.

   o  network security compliance systems,

   o  Servers and workstations,

   o  applications,

   o  network vulnerabilities systems,

   o  internal auditor and intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/
      IPS), and

   o  web application systems.

   All of these features require the I2NSF working group standardize the
   way to pass these assessments to and from the I2NSF client on the
   I2NSF management system and the I2NSF Agent.

5.6.1.7.  Intrusion Detection

   Document:
   https://downloads.cloudsecurityalliance.org/initiatives/secaas/
   SecaaS_Cat_6_Intrusion_Management_Implementation_Guidance.pdf)

   The CSA SaaS Intrusion detection management includes intrusion
   detection through: devices:

   o  Network traffic inspection, behavioural analysis, and flow
      analysis,

   o  Operating System, Virtualization Layer, and Host Process Events
      monitoring,

   o  monitoring of Application Layer Events, and

   o  Correlation Techniques, and other Distributed and Cloud-Based
      Capabilities

   Intrusion response includes both:

   o  Automatic, Manual, or Hybrid Mechanisms,

   o  Technical, Operational, and Process Mechanisms.

   The CSA SaaS recommends the intrusion security management systems
   include provisioning and monitoring of all of these types of
   intrusion detection (IDS) or intrusion protection devices.  The
   management of these systems requires also requires:

   Document:
   https://downloads.cloudsecurityalliance.org/initiatives/secaas/
   SecaaS_Cat_7_SIEM_Implementation_Guidance.pdf)

   The Security Information and Event Management (SEIM) receives data
   from a wide range of security systems such as Identity management
   systems (IAM), data loss prevention (DLP), web security (Web), email
   security (email), intrusion detection/prevision (IDS/IPS)),
   encryption, disaster recovery, and network security.  The SEIM
   combines this data into a single streams.  All the requirements for
   data to/from these systems are replicated in these systems needs to
   give a report to the SIEM system.

   A SIEM system would be prime candidate to have a I2NSF client that
   gathers data from an I2NSF Agent associated with these various types
   of security systems.  The CSA SaaS SIEM functionality document

   suggests that one concern is to have standards that allow timely
   recording and sharing of data.  I2NSF can provide this.

5.6.1.9.  Encryption

   Document:
   https://downloads.cloudsecurityalliance.org/initiatives/secaas/
   SecaaS_Cat_8_Encryption_Implementation_Guidance.pdf

   The CSA SaaS Encryption implementation guidance document considers
   how one implements and manages the following security systems:

      key management systems (KMS), control of keys, and key life cycle;

      Shared Secret encryption (Symmetric ciphers),

      No-Secret or Public Key Encryption (asymmetric ciphers),

      hashing algorithms,

      Digital Signature Algorithms,

      Key Establishment Schemes,

      Protection of Cryptographic Key Material (FIPS 140-2; 140-3),

      Interoperability of Encryption Systems, Key Conferencing, Key
      Escrow Systems, and others

      application of Encryption for Data at rest, data in transit, and
      data in use;

      PKI (including certificate revocation "CRL");

      Future application of such technologies as Homomorphic encryption,
      Quantum Cryptography, Identitybased Encryption, and others;

      Crypto-system Integrity (How bad implementations can under mind a
      crypto-system), and

      Cryptographic Security Standards and Guidelines

   The wide variety of encryption services require the security
   management systems be able to provision, monitor, and control the
   systems that are being used to encrypt data.  This document indicates
   in the implementation sections that the standardization of interfaces
   to/from management systems are key to good key management systems,
   encryption systems, and crypto-systems.

5.6.1.10.  Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BC/DR)

   Document:
   https://downloads.cloudsecurityalliance.org/initiatives/secaas/
   SecaaS_Cat_9_BCDR_Implementation_Guidance.pdf

   The CSA SaaS Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BC/DR)
   implementation guidance document considers the systems that implement
   the the contingency plans and measures designed and implemented to
   ensure operational resiliency in the event of any service
   interruptions.  BC/DR systems includes:

      Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery BC/DR as a service,
      including categories such as complete Disaster Recovery as a
      Service (DRaaS), and subsets such as file recovery, backup and
      archive,

      Storage as a Service including object, volume, or block storage;

      old Site, Warm Site, Hot Site backup plans;

      IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service),
      and SaaS (Software as a Service);

      Insurance (and insurance reporting programs)

      Business Partner Agents (business associate agreements);

      System Replication (for high availability);

      Fail-back to Live Systems mechanisms and management;

      Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO);

      Encryption (data at rest [DAR], data in motion [DIM], field
      level);

      Realm-based Access Control;

      Service-level Agreements (SLA); and

      ISO/IEC 24762:2008, BS25999, ISO 27031, and FINRA Rule 4370

   These BC/DR systems must handle data backup and recovery, server
   backup/recovery, and data center (virtual/physical) backup and
   recovery.  Recovery as a service (RaaS) means that the BC/DR services
   are being handled by management systems outside the enterprise.

Internet-Draft        I2NSF Existing Work Analysis          October 2015


   The wide variety of BC/DR requires the security management systems to
   be able to communicate provisioning, monitor, and control those
   systems that are being used to back-up and restore data.  An
   interoperable protocol that allows provision and control of data
   center's data, servers, and data center management devices devices is
   extremely important to this application.  Recovery as a Service
   (SaaS) indicates that these services need to be able to be remotely
   management.

   The CSA SaaS BC/BR documents indicate how important a standardized
   I2NSF protocol is.

5.6.1.11.  Network Security Devices

   Document:
   https://downloads.cloudsecurityalliance.org/initiatives/secaas/
   SecaaS_Cat_10_Network_Security_Implementation_Guidance.pdf

   The CSA SaaS Network Security implementation recommendation includes
   advice on:

      How to segment networks,

      Network security controls,

      Controlling ingress and egress controls such as Firewalls
      (Stateful), Content Inspection and Control (Network-based),
      Intrusion Detection System/Intrusion Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS),
      and Web Application Firewalls,

      Secure routing and time,

      Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
      Protection/Mitigation,

      Virtual Private Network (VPN) with Multiprotocol Label Switching
      (MPLS) Connectivity (over SSL), Internet Protocol Security (IPsec)
      VPNs, Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS), and Ethernet Virtual
      Private Line (EVPL),

      Threat Management,

      Forensic Support, and

      Privileged User/Use Monitoring.

   These network security systems require provisioning, monitoring, and
   the ability for the security management system to subscribe to

   receive logs, snapshots of capture data, and time synchronization.
   This document states the following:

      "It is critical to understand what monitoring APIs are available
      from the CSP, and if they match risk and compliance requirements",

      "Network security auditors are challenged by the need to track a
      server and its identity from creation to deletion.  Audit tracking
      is challenging in even the most mature cloud environments, but the
      challenges are greatly complicated by cloud server sprawl, the
      situation where the number of cloud servers being created is
      growing more quickly than a cloud environments ability to manage
      them."

      A valid threat vector for cloud is the API access.  Since a
      majority of CSPs today support public API interfaces available
      within their networks and likely over the Internet."

   The CSA SaaS network security indicates that the I2NSF must be secure
   so that the I2NSF Client-Agent protocol does not become a valid
   threat vector.  In additions, the need for the management protocol
   like I2NSF is critical in the sprawl of Cloud environment.

5.6.2.  I2NSF Gap Analysis

   The CSA Security as a Service (SaaS) document show clearly that there
   is a gap between the ability of the CSA SaaS devices to have a vendor
   neutral, inoperable protocol that allow the multiple of network
   security devices to communicate passing provisioning and
   informational data.  Each of the 10 implementation agreements points
   to this as a shortage.  The I2NSF yang models and protocol is needed
   according to the CSA SaaS documents.

5.7.  In-depth Review of IETF protocols

5.7.1.  NETCONF and RESTCONF

   The IETF NETCONF working group has developed the basics of the
   NETCONF protocol focusing on secure configuration and querying
   operational state.  The NETCONF protocol [RFC6241] may be run over
   TLS [RFC6639] or SSH ([RFC6242].  NETCONF can be expanded to defaults
   [RFC6243], handling events ([RFC5277] and basic notification
   [RFC6470], and filtering writes/reads based on network access control
   models (NACM, [RFC6536]).  The NETCONF configuration must be
   committed to a configuration data store (denoted as config=TRUE).
   Yang models identify nodes within a configuration data store or an
   operational data store using a XPath expression (document root ---to
   --- target source).  NETCONF uses an RPC model and provides protocol



Hares, et al.            Expires April 20, 2016                [Page 40]

Internet-Draft        I2NSF Existing Work Analysis          October 2015


   for handling configs (get-config, edit-config, copy-config, delete-
   config, lock, unlock, get) and sessions (close-session, kill-
   session).  The NETCONF Working Group has developed RESTCONF, which is
   an HTTP-based protocol that provides a programmatic interface for
   accessing data defined in YANG, using the datastores defined in
   NETCONF.

   RESTCONF supports "two edit condition detections" - time stamp and
   entity tag.  RESTCONF uses a URI encoded path expressions.  RESTCONF
   provides operations to get remote servers options (OPTIONS), retrieve
   data headers (HEAD), get data (GET), create resource/invoke operation
   (POST), patch data (PATCH), delete resource (DELETE), or query.

   RFCs for NETCONF

   o  NETCONF [RFC6242]

   o  NETCONF monitoring [RFC6022]

   o  NETCONF over SSH [RFC6242]

   o  NETCONF over TLS [RFC5539]

   o  NETCONF system notification> [RFC6470]

   o  NETCONF access-control (NACM) [RFC6536]

   o  RESTCONF [I-D.ietf-netconf-restconf]

   o  NETCONF-RESTCONF call home [I-D.ietf-netconf-call-home]

   o  RESTCONF collection protocol
      [I-D.ietf-netconf-restconf-collection]

   o  NETCONF Zero Touch Provisioning [I-D.ietf-netconf-zerotouch]

5.7.2.  I2RS Protocol

   Based on input from the NETCONF working group, the I2RS working group
   decided to re-use the NETCONF or RESTCONF protocols and specify
   additions to these protocols rather than create yet another protocol
   (YAP).

   The required extensions for the I2RS protocol are in the following
   drafts:

   o  Ephemeral state [I-D.ietf-i2rs-ephemeral-state],




Hares, et al.            Expires April 20, 2016                [Page 41]

Internet-Draft        I2NSF Existing Work Analysis          October 2015


   o  Publication-Subscription notifications
      [I-D.ietf-i2rs-pub-sub-requirements],

   o  Traceability [I-D.ietf-i2rs-traceability],

   o  Security requirements [I-D.hares-i2rs-auth-trans]

   At this time, NETCONF and RESTCONF cannot handle the ephemeral data
   store proposed by I2RS, the publication and subscription
   requirements, the traceability, or the security requirements for the
   transport protocol and message integrity.

5.7.3.  NETMOD Yang modules

   NETMOD developed initial Yang models for interfaces [RFC7223]), IP
   address ([RFC7277]), IPv6 Router advertisement ([RFC7277]), IP
   Systems ([RFC7317]) with system ID, system time management, DNS
   resolver, Radius client, SSH, syslog
   ([I-D.ietf-netmod-syslog-model]), ACLS ([I-D.ietf-netmod-acl-model]),
   and core routing blocks ([I-D.ietf-netmod-routing-cfg] The routing
   working group (rtgwg) has begun to examine policy for routing and
   tunnels.

   Protocol specific Working groups have developed yang models for ISIS
   ([I-D.ietf-isis-yang-isis-cfg]), OSPF ([I-D.ietf-ospf-yang]), and BGP
   ( merge of [I-D.shaikh-idr-bgp-model] and [I-D.zhdankin-idr-bgp-cfg]
   with the bgp policy proposed multiple Working groups (idr and
   rtgwg)).  BGP Services yang models have been proposed for PPB EVPN
   ([I-D.tsingh-bess-pbb-evpn-yang-cfg]), EVPN
   ([I-D.zhuang-bess-evpn-yang]), L3VPN ([I-D.zhuang-bess-l3vpn-yang]),
   and multicast MPLS/BGP IP VPNs ([I-D.liu-bess-mvpn-yang]).

5.7.4.  COPS

   One early focus on flow filtering based on policy enforcement of
   traffic entering a network is the 1990s COPS [RFC2748] design (PEP
   and PDP) as shown in figure 16.  The Policy decision point kept
   network-wide policy (E.g.  ACLs) and sent it to Policy enforcements
   who then would control what data flows between the two These decision
   points controlled data flow from PEP to PEP.  [RFC3084] describes
   COPS use for policy provisioning.

              Figure 16

   COPS had a design of Policy Enforcement Points (PEP), and policy
   Decision Points (PDP) as shown in figure 16.  These decision points
   controlled flow from PEP to PEP.

   Why COPS is no longer used

   Security in the network in 2015 uses specific devices (IDS/IPS, NAT
   firewall, etc) with specific policies and profiles for each types of
   device.  No common protocol or policy format exists between the
   policy manager (PDP) and security enforcement points.

   COPs RFCs: [RFC4261], [RFC2940], , [RFC3084], , [RFC3483]

   Why I2NSF is different COPS

   COPS was a protocol for policy related to Quality of Service (QoS)
   and signalling protocols (e.g.  RSVP) (security, flow, and others).
   I2NSF creates a common protocol between security policy decision
   points (SPDP) and security enforcement points (SEP).  Today's
   security devices currently only use proprietary protocols.
   Manufacturers would like a security specific policy enforcement
   protocol rather than a generic policy protocol.

5.7.5.  PCP

   As indicated by the name, the Port Control Protocol (PCP) enables an
   IPv4 or IPv6 host to flexibly manage the IP address and port mapping
   information on Network Address Translators (NATs) or firewalls, to
   facilitate communication with remote hosts.

   PCP RFCs:

      [RFC6887]

      [RFC7225]

      [I-D.ietf-pcp-authentication]

      [I-D.ietf-pcp-optimize-keepalives]

      [I-D.ietf-pcp-proxy]

   Why is I2NSF different from PCP:

   Here are some aspects that I2NSF is different from PCP:

   o  PCP only supports the management of port and address information
      rather than any other security functions

   o  Cover the proxy, firewall and NAT box proposals in I2NSF

5.7.6.  NSIS - Next steps in Signalling

   NSIS is for standardizing an IP signalling protocol (RSVP) along data
   path for end points to request its unique QoS characteristics, unique
   FW policies or NAT needs (RFC5973) that are different from the FW/NAT
   original setting.  The requests are communicated directly to the FW/
   NAT devices.  NSIS is like east-west protocols that require all
   involved devices to fully comply to make it work.

   NSIS is path-coupled, it is possible to message every participating
   device along a path without having to know its location, or its
   location relative to other devices (this is particularly a pressing
   issue when you've got one or more NATs present in the network, or
   when trying to locate appropriate tunnel endpoints).

   A diagram should be added here showing I2NSF and NSIS

   Why I2NSF is different than NSIS:

   o  The I2NSF requests from clients do not go directly to network
      security devices, but instead to controller or orchestrator that
      can translate the application/user oriented policies to the
      involved devices in the interface that they support.

   o  The I2NSF request does not require all network functions in a path
      to comply, but it is a protocol between the I2NSF client and the
      I2NSF Agent in the controller and orchestrator

   o  I2NSF defines client (applications) oriented descriptors
      (profiles, or attributes) to request/negotiate/validate the

   Why we belief I2NSF has a higher chance to be deployed than NSIS:

   o  Open Stack already has a proof-of-concept/preliminary
      implementation, but the specification is not complete.  IETF can
      play an active role to make the specification for I2NSF is
      complete.  IETF can complete and extend the OpenStack
      implementation to provide an interoperable specification that can
      meet the needs and requirements of operators and is workable for
      suppliers of the technology.  The combination of a carefully
      designed interoperable IETF specification with an open-source code
      development Open Stack will leverage the strengths of the two
      communities, and expand the informal ties between the two groups.
      A software development cycle has the following components:
      architecture, design specification, coding, and interoperability
      testing.  The IETF can take ownership of the first two steps, and
      provide expertise and a good working atmosphere (in hack-a-thons)
      in the last two steps for OpenSTack or other open-source coders.

   o  IETF has the expertise in security architecture and design for
      interoperable protocols that span controllers/routers, middle-
      boxes, and security end-systems.

   o  IETF has a history of working on interoperable protocols or
      virtualized network functions (L2VPN, L3VPN) that are deployed by
      operators in large scale devices.  IETF has a strong momentum to
      create virtualized network functions (see SFC WG in routing) to be
      deployed in network boxes.  [Note: We need to add SACM and others
      here].

6.  Summarized Requirements

   The I2NSF framework should provide a set of standard interfaces that
   facilitate:

   o  Dynamic creation, enablement, disablement, and removal of network
      security functions;

   o  Policy-driven placement of new function instances in the right
      administrative domain;

   o  Attachment of appropriate security and traffic policies to the
      function instances

   o  Management of deployed instances in terms of fault monitoring,
      utilization monitoring, event logging, inventory, etc.

   Moreover, an I2NSF must support different deployment scenarios:

   o  Single and multi-tenant environments: The term multi-tenant does
      not mean just different companies subscribing to a provider's

      offering.  It can for instance cover administrative domains/
      departments within a single firm that require different security
      and traffic policies.

   o  Premise-agnostic: Said network security functions may be deployed
      on premises or off premises of an organization.

   The I2NSF framework should provide a standard set of interfaces that
   enable:

   o  Translation of security policies into functional tasks.  Security
      policies may be carried out by one or more security functions.
      For example, a security policy may be translated into an IDS/IPS
      policy and a firewall policy for a given application type.

   o  Translation of functional tasks into vendor-specific configuration
      sets.  For example, a firewall policy needs to be converted to
      vendor-specific configurations.

   o  Retrieval of information such as configuration, utilization,
      status, etc.  Such information may be used for monitoring,
      auditing, troubleshooting purposes.  The above functionality
      should be available in single- or multi-tenant environments as
      well as on-premise or off-premise clouds.

7.  IANA Considerations

   No IANA considerations exist for this document.

8.  Security Considerations

   The relationship between different actors define the security level
   for the different use cases and must be associated with
   administrative domains:

   o  Closed environments where there is only one administrative network
      domain.  More permissive access controls and lighter validation
      shall be allowed inside the domain because of the protected
      environment.  Integration with existing identity management
      systems is also possible.

   o  Open environments where some NSFs can be hosted in different
      administrative domains, and more restrictive security controls are
      required.  The interfaces to the NSFs must use trusted channels.
      Identity frameworks and federations are common models for
      authentication and Authorization.  Security controllers will be in
      charge of this functionalities.

   Virtualization applied to NSF environment (vNSF) generate several
   concerns in security, being one of the most relevant the attestation
   of the vNSF by the clients.  A holistic analysis has been done in
