Abstract

   This document presents different deployment models of PCN-based
   admission control (AC) and flow termination (FT) using packet-
   specific dual marking (PSDM) for encoding.  Their major is that they
   require only a single DSCP for packet marking and that they work
   reliably in the presence of ingress-egress aggregates (IEAs) with
   only a very small average number of flows.  Moreover, an advanced
   model even works with multipath routing.

1.  Introduction

   Pre-congestion notification (PCN) supports admission control (AC) and
   flow termination (FT) for high priority flows in a DiffServ region in
   order to protect the quality of service (QoS) of inelastic flows
   [PCN-arch].  PCN assumes that each link of a network is associated
   with a PCN admissible and supportable rate (AR, SR).  If its PCN
   traffic rate is below AR, the link is not pre-congested, if it is
   above AR, the link is AR-pre-congested, and if it is above SR, the
   link is SR-pre-congested.  In case of AR-pre-congestion, AC should
   block new PCN flows using this link and in case of SR-pre-congestion,
   FT should terminate sufficiently many PCN flows using this link to
   reduce the PCN rate below SR.

   Packet meter and markers on links of a so-called PCN domain mark
   packets in case of pre-congestion to notify the egress nodes about
   the highest pre-congestion level on their paths.  The egress nodes
   turn this information into AC and FT decisions.  Excess traffic
   marking marks PCN packets that exceed a certain reference rate on a
   link while exhaustive marking marks all PCN packets on a link when
   the PCN traffic rate exceeds a reference rate
   [PCN-marking-behaviour].

   The IP header has not any unused bits.  Therefore, the integration of
   the marks into the IP header is challenging.  A DSCP is chosen to
   indicate PCN and the ECN field [RFC3168] is re-used to indicate the
   exact marking.  Baseline encoding [Baseline] is able to mark packets
   as marked and unmarked and therefore it can support either excess
   traffic marking or exhaustive marking in a network.  Packet-specific
   dual marking (PSDM) [PSDM] supports two concurrent marking schemes in
   a limited way.  There are two different codepoints for unmarked
   packets (NM1, NM2) but only one codepoint for marked packets (M).
   Both baseline and PSDM encoding require only a single DSCP.  For the
   remainder of this draft we assume that packets with codepoint NM1 are
   subject to excess traffic marking packets with codepoint NM2 are
   subject to exhaustive marking.  Both marker types possibly re-mark
   these packets to M in case of AR- or SR-pre-congestion.  To determine
   the meaning of a M-marked packet, it is important to know whether it
   was NM1- or NM2-marked at the ingress node of the PCN domain.  This
   is can be achieved by introducing two types of packets: ordinary data
   packets of a PCN flow and other distinguishable signalling packets.
   These signalling packets may be associated with a flow (e.g.  RSVP
   signalling packets for that flow) or with an IEA (e.g. explicit probe
   packets to maintain its admission state).  Note that both kinds of
   probing do not require extra packets per flow and do not delay the AC
   decision.  Other encoding mechanisms are proposed that require two
   DSCPs [3state].

Internet-Draft           PSDM Deployment Models             October 2008


   This document proposes three AC methods that rely on exhaustive
   marking and three FT methods that rely on excess marking in such a
   way that PSDM can be used to encode the markings.  Basically, any of
   these AC methods can be deployed in combination with any of these FT
   methods.  The deployment of such PCN-based AC and FT has two major
   advantages compared to other deployment models [SM], [CL].

   o  They require only a single DSCP for packet marking.

   o  They work reliably even if the average number of flows per IEA is
      low.

   o  Some of them work even in case of multipath routing.

3.  Admission Control Methods

   In this section we explain three AC methods that rely on PCN feedback
   from probe packets.  We first explain the assumption on metering and
   marking and then present the AC methods.  Two of these AC methods
   maintain AC states for IEAs while the third AC method implements
   implicit probing per flow.

3.1.  Configuration of the Exhaustive Marker

   The probe packets are marked with NM2 by PCN ingress nodes to
   indicate to PCN nodes that they are subject to exhaustive marking.
   The reference rate of the exhaustive markers is set to the admissible
   rate.  It meters and marks all PCN packets and possibly re-marks NM2
   marked PCN packets to M.

3.2.  Admission Control Based on AC States for IEAs (IEABAC) Using Probe
      Traffic

   IEABAC assumes that IEA contexts are a priori set up for all IEAs for
   which PCN flows should be admitted.  An IEA context keeps an AC state
   K at the PCN ingress node of the IEA.  The AC state K may be either
   "admit" or "block".  Based on this AC state, the PCN ingress node can
   either admit or block further flows for the corresponding IEA.  To
   update the AC state according to the pre-congestion level of the path
   over which the traffic of the IEA is carried, the PCN ingress node
   sends in regular intervals extra probe messages addressed to the
   corresponding PCN egress node.  This signalling traffic is marked as
   PCN traffic with NM2 to indicate that it is subject to exhaustive
   marking.  As exhaustive marking is independent of packet sizes, the
   size of the probe packets can be chosen very small probe to minimize
   the rate of the signalling traffic.  The probe packets have a special
   format so that PCN egress nodes recognize them as such for the
   corresponding PCN ingress nodes and associate them with the correct
   IEA.  Based on the markings of the probe packets (NM2, M), the PCN
   egress node derives the new AC state for the IEA and sends and
   admission-stop or admission-continue message to the corresponding PCN
   ingress in order to update the AC state of the IEA.  In the following
   we propose two approaches for PCN egress nodes to determine the new
   AC state of an IEA.

3.2.1.  Observation-Based AC for IEAs Using Probe Packets

   When the PCN egress node receives an M-marked probe packet, it sends
   an admission-stop message to the corresponding PCN ingress node and
   sets a timer for the minimum block interval to a configurable value
   Tblock.  The timer may be reset by consecutive arrivals of M-marked
   probe packets.  When the timer expires, an admission-continue message

Internet-Draft           PSDM Deployment Models             October 2008


   is sent to the PCN ingress node.

3.2.2.  Congestion Level Estimate (CLE) Based AC for IEAs Using Probe
        Packets

   The PCN-egress-node proceeds in measurement intervals of a
   configurable time MI.  It tracks the number of missing missing probe
   packets or probe packets received with an M-mark during a measurement
   interval and at its end it calculates the CLE as the fraction of this
   number and the number of overall received and missing probe packets.
   If the CLE is smaller than a configurable value TadmCont, an
   admission-continue message is sent to the PCN ingress node.  If the
   CLE is larger than a configurable value TadmStop, an admission-stop
   message is sent to the PCN ingress node.

3.3.  Implicit per-Flow Probing

   We briefly review RSVP and explain how its signalling messages can be
   re-used for implicit per-flow probing.

3.3.1.  A Brief Summary of RSVP

   Realtime flows are usually accompanied by end-to-end signalling.  A
   popular protocol example is RSVP [RFC2205].  With RSVP, the data
   source issues a PATH message which is carried hop-by-hop over the
   same path future data packets will go.  To that end, the PATH message
   uses the same source and destination address as future data packets
   and also all other header fields that are possible input for routing
   and load balancing decisions need to be the same.  When a PATH
   message arrives at an RSVP-capable node, a PATH state is established
   pointing to the previous hop before the PATH message is forwarded
   further downstream.  When the PATH message arrives at the
   destination, the destination triggers the end-to-end reservation for
   the flow by sending a RESV message upstream along the nodes that set
   up a PATH state.  In these nodes, the RESV message is processed.  In
   particular, resource admission control is performed for the new flow
   request and if it succeeds, the node forwards the RESV message to the
   previous hop recorded by the PATH state.  This two pass signalling
   approach guarantees that the reservation is done on the downstream
   path of the future data flow.  In contrast to PATH messages, RESV
   messages have the source address of the sending node and the
   destination address of the hop pointed to by the PATH state.  That
   way, the information about the downstream next hop of the future data
   stream is conveyed to the previous hop and the flow-related
   information is stored in a RESV state.  RSVP is a soft-state
   protocol, i.e., the PATH and RESV control messages are periodically
   sent to keep the PATH and RESV states alive and, thereby, the flow
   reservations.  Admission control needs to be performed for a flow

Internet-Draft           PSDM Deployment Models             October 2008


   only once when no RESV state is set up, yet.

3.3.2.  Modification of Standard RSVP to Perform PCN-Based AC

   We assume that interior nodes of a PCN domain are RSVP-disabled.
   That means, they just forward RSVP messages without processing them
   and PCN ingress and egress nodes are neighboring RSVP-capable nodes.
   As a consequence, PCN ingress nodes decide whether new flows can be
   admitted and carried through domain or not.  When the initial PATH
   message travels downstream, it is marked with NM2 by the ingress node
   to indicate to PCN nodes that this packet is subject to exhaustive
   marking.  It is possibly re-marked to M and eventually received by
   the PCN egress node.  If no PATH state can be found for this flow at
   the PCN egress node, this PATH message is the first one and not a
   REFRESH message.  If the PATH message is the first of the flow and if
   it is marked with M, the RSVP engine sends back a PATHERR message to
   reject the flow.  If the PATH message is still marked with NM2, the
   RSVP PATH state is established at the PCN egress node and the PATH
   message is forwarded further downstream.  REFRESH messages are just
   forwarded according to standard RSVP.  When the PATH message arrives
   at the destination and a RESV message is sent back along the nodes
   with a PATH state.  Eventually, the corresponding RESV message
   arrives at the PCN ingress node.  When no RESV state is set up yet,
   this is the first RESV message and admission control must be
   performed.  By the mere fact that the RESV message arrives, the PCN
   ingress node knows that the corresponding initial PATH message was
   not marked.  Thus, it can admit any flow for which a new RESV message
   arrives.

   Note that RSVP is only an example for a two-pass end-to-end
   signalling protocol and the principle can be adopted to others.

4.  Flow Termination Methods

   In this section we explain three FT methods that rely on PCN feedback
   from PCN data packets.  We first explain the assumption on metering
   and marking and then present the FT methods.

4.1.  Configuration of the Excess Marker

   The PCN data packets are marked with NM1 by PCN ingress nodes to
   indicate to PCN nodes that they are subject to excess marking.  The
   reference rate of the excess markers is set to the supportable rate.
   It meters all NM1-marked PCN packets and possibly re-marks them to M.
   Thus, PCN signalling traffic required for AC is not taken into
   account, but it is designed to have a low bitrate.

4.2.  Direct Measured Rate Termination (DMRT)

4.2.1.  Operation

   see [Overview]

4.2.2.  Packet Dropping Policy

   DMRT requires preferential dropping of unmarked (NM1) PCN data
   packets, otherwise the termination process can be delayed [FT-PE].

4.3.  Indirect Measured Rate Termination (IMRT)

4.3.1.  Operation

   See [Overview], same mechanism as in [CL].

4.3.2.  Required Packet Dropping Policy

   IMRT requires preferential dropping of marked (M) PCN data packets,
   otherwise significant overtermination can occur [FT-PE].

4.4.  Marked Flow Termination for IEAs (MFT, MFT-IEA)

4.4.1.  Operation

   See [MFT-PE].

4.4.2.  Required Packet Dropping Policy

   MFT-IEA works optimal when unmarked (NM1) PCN data packets are
   preferentially dropped in case of unavoidable PCN packet loss.
   However, the termination process is only little delayed without

5.  Comparison with Other Deployment Models

5.1.  Comparison with the Single-Marking (SM) Deployment Model

   SM [SM] uses only a single marking scheme.  Therefore, baseline
   encoding [Baseline] can be used for PCN marking which requires also
   only a single DSCP.  However, SM uses CLE-based AC using feedback
   from data packets and as a result, it cannot block when an IEA is
   empty.  This can lead to significant overadmission [AC-PE].
   Furthermore, its termination method can lead to overtermination
   [FT-PE] even in the case of single bottlenecks [FT-PE].  Neither the
   AC nor the FT part of this method reliably workw in the presence of
   multipath routing.

5.2.  Comparison with the Control-Load (CL) Deployment Model

   CL [CL] uses two marking schemes and requires that packets can be re-
   marked to two different codepoints.  This cannot be achieved with a
   single DSCP [3state].  Spending more than a single DSCP for PCN
   encoding seems very expensive.  Therefore, the AC mechanism of CL
   should be modified, e.g. using one of the mechanisms presented in
   this document, so that a single DSCP suffices for PCN encoding.

   Like SM, CL is prone to overadmission when the number of expected
   flows per IEA is small [AC-PE].  CL's flow termination method is
   prone to overtermination in case of quickly changing traffic rates
   [FT-PE].  Neither its AC nor its FT method works with multipath
   routing.

8.  Conclusions

   This document presented three methods for admission control and three
   methods for flow termination.  The AC methods rely on probe packets
   which are subject to exhaustive marking and the FT methods rely on
   data packets which are subject to excess marking so that packet-
   specific dual marking (PSDM) can be used to encode PCN marks which
   requires only a single DSCP for PCN.  All AC and FT methods work with
   when the expected number of flows per ingress-aggregate is small.
   Each of the AC methods is compatible with each of the FT methods.
   One AC method and one FT method even works with multipath routing.
   Those are significant advantages compared to the deployment models
   presented in [SM], [CL].
