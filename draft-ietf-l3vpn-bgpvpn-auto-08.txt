1. Introduction 
 
 
   In any provider-based VPN scheme, the Provider Edge (PE) devices 
   attached to a common VPN must exchange certain information as a 
   prerequisite to establish VPN-specific connectivity. An auto-
   discovery mechanism allows a PE to dynamically discover the set of 
   remote PEs having VPN members in common. The auto-discovery 
   mechanism proceeds by having a PE advertises to other PEs, at a 
   minimum, its own IP address and the list of VPN sites configured 
   on that PE. Once that information is received the remote PEs will 
   then identify the list of VPN sites member of the same VPN with the 
   advertising PE, and use the information carried within the discovery 
   mechanism to establish VPN connectivity. 
    
   The purpose of this draft is to define a BGP based auto-discovery 
   mechanism for VR-based VPNs [VPN-VR] solution. This mechanism is 
   based on the approach used by [BGP/MPLS-IP-VPN] for distributing VPN 
   routing information within the service provider(s).  
 
    
   Virtual router (VR) addresses must be exchanged, along with the 
   information needed to enable the PEs to determine which VRs are in 
   the same VPN ("membership"), and which of those VRs are to have VPN 
   connectivity ("topology"). Once the VRs are reachable through the 
   tunnels, routes ("reachability") are then exchanged by running 
   existing routing protocols per VPN basis.  
 
   The BGP-4 multiprotocol extensions are used to carry various 
   information about VR-based VPNs. VPN-specific information associated 
   with the NLRI is encoded either as attributes of the NLRI, or as 
   part of the NLRI itself, or both.

2. Provider-Provisioned VPN Reference Model  
    
   When using BGP as an auto-discovery mechanism, VR-based l3vpns are

   It is assumed that the PEs can use BGP to distribute information to 
   each other. This may be via direct IBGP peering, via direct EBGP 
   peering, via multihop BGP peering, through intermediaries such as 
   Route Reflectors, through a chain of intermediate BGP connections, 
   etc.  
   
 
3. Carrying VR-based VPN information in BGP  
 
   The BGP-4 multiprotocol extensions are used to carry various 
   information about VPNs. VPN-specific information associated with the 
   NLRI is encoded either as attributes of the NLRI, or as part of the 
   NLRI itself, or both.  The addressing information in the NLRI field 
   is ALWAYS within the VPN address space, and therefore MUST be unique 
   within the VPN. The address specified in the BGP next hop attribute, 
   on the other hand, is in the service provider addressing space.  
 
    
   The NLRI is a VPN-IP address or a labeled VPN-IP address. The NLRI 
   address prefix is an address of one of the virtual routers 
   configured on the PE. That address is used by the VRs to establish 
   routing adjacencies and tunnel to each other [VPN-VR].

4. Interpretation of VPN Information in the VR Model 
    
4.1  Membership Discovery 
    
   The VPN-ID format as defined in [RFC-2685] is used to identify a 
   VPN. All virtual routers that are members of a specific VPN share 
   the same VPN-ID. A VPN-ID is carried in the NLRI to make addresses 
   of VRs globally unique. Making these addresses globally unique is 
   necessary if one uses BGP for VRs' auto-discovery. 
 
    
4.2  Encoding of the VPN-ID in the NLRI 
    
   For the virtual router model, the VPN-ID is carried within the route 
   distinguisher (RD) field. In order to hold the 7-bytes VPN-ID, the 
   first byte of RD type field is used to indicate the existence of the 
   VPN-ID format. A value of 0x80 in the first byte of RD's type field 
   indicates that the RD field is carrying the VPN-ID format. In this 
   case, the type field range 0x8000-0x80ff will be reserved for the 
   virtual router case. 
    
    
4.3  VPN-ID Extended Community 
    
   A new extended community is used to carry the VPN-ID format. This 
   attribute is transitive across the Autonomous system boundary. The 
   type field of the VPN-ID extended community is of regular type to be 
   assigned by IANA [BGP-COMM]. The remaining 7 bytes hold the VPN-ID 
   value field as per [RFC-2685]. The BGP UPDATE message will carry 
   information for a single VPN. It is the VPN-ID Extended Community, 
   or more precisely route filtering based on the Extended Community 
   that allows one VR to find out about other VRs in the same VPN.  
 
 
4.4  VPN Topology Information 
    
   A new extended community is used to indicate different VPN topology 
   values. This attribute is transitive across the Autonomous system 
   boundary. The value of the type field for extended type is assigned 
   by IANA. The first two bytes of the value field (of the remaining 6 
   bytes) are reserved. The actual topology values are carried within 
   the remaining four bytes. The following topology values are defined: 
    
         Value    Topology Type 
    
           1          "Hub" 
           2          "Spoke" 
           3          "Mesh" 
    
   Arbitrary values can also be used to allow specific topologies to be 
   constructed.  
    
 
Ould-Brahim & Rosen & Rekhter       September 2006           [Page 4] 
Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-l3vpn-bgpvpn-auto-08.txt      September 2006 
 
   In a hub and spoke topology, spoke VRs (i.e., PE having VRs as 
   spokes within the VPN) will advertise their BGP information with VPN 
   topology extended community with value of "2". Spoke VRs will only 
   be allowed to connect to hub VRs and therefore spoke VR-based PEs 
   will just import VPN information from BGP that is set of "1". Hub 
   sites can connect to both hub and spoke sites (i.e., Hub VRs can 
   import VPN topology of both values "1", "2", or "3". In a mesh 
   topology, mesh sites connect to each other, each VR will advertise 
   VPN topology information of "3".  
    
   Furthermore, in the presence of both hub and spoke and mesh 
   topologies within the same VPN, mesh sites can as well connect to 
   hub sites and vice versa. 
 
 
 
 
5. Tunnel Discovery 
    
   Layer-3 VPNs must be implemented through some form of tunneling 
   mechanism, where the packet formats and/or the addressing used 
   within the VPN can be unrelated to that used to route the tunneled 
   packets across the backbone. There are numerous tunneling mechanisms 
   that can be used by a network based VPN (e.g., IP/IP [RFC-2003], GRE 
   tunnels [RFC-1701], IPSec [RFC-2401], and MPLS tunnels [RFC-3031]). 
   Each of these tunnels allows for opaque transport of frames as 
   packet payload across the backbone, with forwarding disjoint from 
   the address fields of the encapsulated packets. A provider edge 
   router may terminate multiple types of tunnels and forward packets 
   between these tunnels and other network interfaces in different 
   ways. BGP can be used to carry tunnel endpoint addresses between 
   edge routers.  
 
    
   The BGP next hop will carry the service provider tunnel endpoint 
   address. As an example, if IPSec is used as tunneling mechanism, the 
   IPSec tunnel remote address will be discovered through BGP, and the 
   actual tunnel establishment is achieved through IPSec signaling 
   protocol.  
    
   When MPLS tunneling is used, the label carried in the NLRI field is 
   associated with an address of a VR, where the address is carried in 
   the NLRI and is encoded as a VPN-IP address. 
    
   The auto-discovery mechanism should convey minimum information for 
   the tunnels to be setup. The means of distributing multiplexors must 
   be defined either via some sort of tunnel-protocol-specific signaling 
   mechanism, or via additional information carried by the   
   auto-discovery protocol. That information may or may not be  
   used directly within the specific signaling protocol. On one end of 
   the spectrum, the combination of IP address (such as BGP next hop and 
   IP address carried within the NLRI) and the label and/or VPN-ID 
   provides sufficient information for a PE to setup per VPN tunnels or

Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-l3vpn-bgpvpn-auto-08.txt      September 2006 
 
   shared tunnels per set of VPNs. On another end of the spectrum 
   additional specific tunnel related information can be carried within 
   the discovery process if needed. 
 
 
 
6. Scalability Considerations 
    
   In this section, we briefly summarize the main characteristics of 
   our model with respect to scalability. 
    
   Recall that the Service Provider network consists of (a) PE routers, 
   (b) BGP Route Reflectors, (c) P routers (which are neither PE 
   routers nor Route Reflectors), and, in the case of multi-provider 
   VPNs, (d) ASBRs. 
    
   A PE router, unless it is a Route Reflector should not retain 
   VPN-related information unless it has at least one VPN with an 
   Import Target identical to one of the VPN-related information Route 
   Target attributes.  Inbound filtering should be used to cause such 
   information to be discarded.  If a new Import Target is later added 
   to one of the PE's VPNs (a "VPN Join" operation), it must then 
   acquire the VPN-related information it may previously have 
   discarded. 
    
   This can be done using the refresh mechanism described in [BGP-
   RFSH]. 
    
   The outbound route filtering mechanism of [BGP-ORF], [BGP-CONS] can 
   also be used to advantage to make the filtering more dynamic. 
    
   Similarly, if a particular Import Target is no longer present in 
   any of a PE's VPNs (as a result of one or more "VPN Prune" 
   operations), the PE may discard all VPN-related information which, 
   as a result, no longer have any of the PE's VPN's Import Targets as 
   one of their Route Target Attributes. 
    
   Note that VPN Join and Prune operations are non-disruptive, and do 
   not require any BGP connections to be brought down, as long as the 
   refresh mechanism of [BGP-RFSH] is used. 
    
   As a result of these distribution rules, no one PE ever needs to 
   maintain all routes for all VPNs; this is an important scalability 
   consideration. 
    
   Route reflectors can be partitioned among VPNs so that each 
   partition carries routes for only a subset of the VPNs supported by 
   the Service Provider. Thus no single route reflector is required to 
   maintain VPN-related information for all VPNs. 
    
   For inter-provider VPNs, if multi-hop EBGP is used, then the ASBRs 
   need not maintain and distribute VPN-related information at all. 
    
 
Ould-Brahim & Rosen & Rekhter       September 2006           [Page 6] 
Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-l3vpn-bgpvpn-auto-08.txt      September 2006 
 
   P routers do not maintain any VPN-related information.  In order 
   to properly forward VPN traffic, the P routers need only maintain 
   routes to the PE routers and the ASBRs.  
    
   As a result, no single component within the Service Provider network 
   has to maintain all the VPN-related information for all the VPNs. 
   So the total capacity of the network to support increasing numbers 
   of VPNs is not limited by the capacity of any individual component. 
    
   An important consideration to remember is that one may have any 
   number of INDEPENDENT BGP systems carrying VPN-related information. 
   This is unlike the case of the Internet, where the Internet BGP 
   system must carry all the Internet routes. Thus one significant 
   (but perhaps subtle) distinction between the use of BGP for the 
   Internet routing and the use of BGP for distributing VPN-related 
   information, as described in this document is that the former is not 
   amenable to partition, while the latter is. 
 
    
7. Security Considerations 
    
    
   This document describes a BGP-based auto-discovery mechanism which 
   enables a PE router that attaches to a particular VPN to discover 
   the set of other PE routers that attach to the same VPN.  Each PE 
   router that is attached to a given VPN uses BGP to advertise that 
   fact. Other PE routers which attach to the same VPN receive these 
   BGP advertisements. This allows that set of PE routers to discover 
   each other. Note that a PE will not always receive these 
   advertisements directly from the remote PEs; the advertisements may 
   be received from "intermediate" BGP speakers. 
    
   It is of critical importance that a particular PE should not be 
   "discovered" to be attached to a particular VPN unless that PE 
   really is attached to that VPN, and indeed is properly authorized to 
   be attached to that VPN.  If any arbitrary node on the Internet 
   could start sending these BGP advertisements, and if those 
   advertisements were able to reach the PE routers, and if the PE 
   routers accepted those advertisements, then anyone could add any 
   site to any VPN.  Thus the auto-discovery procedures described here 
   presuppose that a particular PE trusts its BGP peers to be who they 
   appear to be, and further that it can trusts those peers to be 
   properly securing their local attachments.  (That is, a PE must 
   trust that its peers are attached to, and are authorized to be 
   attached to, the VPNs to which they claim to be attached.). 
    
   If a particular remote PE is a BGP peer of the local PE, then the 
   BGP authentication procedures of RFC 2385 can be used to ensure that 
   the remote PE is who it claims to be, i.e., that it is a PE that is 
   trusted. 
    
   If a particular remote PE is not a BGP peer of the local PE, then 
   the information it is advertising is being distributed to the local 
 
Ould-Brahim & Rosen & Rekhter       September 2006           [Page 7] 
Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-l3vpn-bgpvpn-auto-08.txt      September 2006 
 
   PE through a chain of BGP speakers.  The local PE must trust that 
   its peers only accept information from peers that they trust in 
   turn, and this trust relation must be transitive.  BGP does not 
   provide a way to determine that any particular piece of received 
   information originated from a BGP speaker that was authorized to 
   advertise that particular piece of information.  Hence the 
   procedures of this document should be used only in environments 
   where adequate trust relationships exist among the BGP speakers. 
    
   Some of the VPN schemes which may use the procedures of this 
   document can be made robust to failures of these trust 
   relationships.  That is, it may be possible to keep the VPNs secure 
   even if the auto-discovery procedures are not secure.  For example, 
   a VPN based on the VR model can use IPsec tunnels for transmitting 
   data and routing control packets between PE routers.  An 
   illegitimate PE router which is discovered via BGP will not have the 
   shared secret which makes it possible to set up the IPsec tunnel, 
   and so will not be able to join the VPN.  Similarly, [IP-GRE] 
   describes procedures for using IPsec tunnels to secure VPNs based on 
   the [BGP/MPLS-IP-VPN] model.  The details for using IPsec to secure 
   a particular sort of VPN depend on that sort of VPN and so are out 
   of scope of the current document. 
    
    
8. IANA Considerations 
  
  
    IANA has assigned new extended community <TBD> for Topology 
    values for VR-based L3VPN solution. 
     
    IANA has assigned new extended community <TBD> for
    carrying VPN-ID format based on RFC2685 format.

    IANA has assigned new SAFI number <TBD> for indicating that 
    the NLRI is carrying information for VR for labeled prefixes.  

    SAFI number "140" for indicating that the NLRI is carrying  
    information for VR for non-labeled prefixes. 

9. Use of BGP Capability Advertisement 
 
   A BGP speaker that uses VPN information as described in this 
   document with multiprotocol extensions should use the Capability 
   Advertisement procedures [RFC-3392] to determine whether the speaker 
   could use Multiprotocol Extensions with a particular peer.

13. Annex: Auto-Discovery in VR and MPLS-IP-VPN Interworking Scenarios 
 
   Two interwoking scenarios are considered when the network is using 
   both virtual routers and BGP/MPLS-IP-VPN. The first scenario is a 
   CE-PE relationship between a PE (implementing BGP/MPLS-IP-VPN), and 
   a VR appearing as a CE to the PE. The connection between the VR, and 
   the PE can be either direct connectivity, or through a tunnel (e.g., 
   IPSec).  
    
   The second scenario is when a PE is implementing both architectures. 
   In this particular case, a single BGP session configured on the 
   service provider network can be used to advertise either BGP/MPLS-
   IP-VPN VPN information or the virtual router related VPN 
   information. From the VR and the BGP/MPLS-IP-VPN point of view there 
   is complete separation from data path and addressing schemes. 
   However the PE's interfaces are shared between both architectures. 
    
   A PE implementing only BGP/MPLS-IP-VPN will not import routes from a 
   BGP UPDATE message containing the VPN-ID extended community. On the 
   other hand, a PE implementing the virtual router architecture will 
   not import routes from a BGP UPDATE message containing the route 
   target extended community attribute. 
    
   The granularity at which the information is either BGP/MPLS-IP-VPN 
   related or VR-related is per BGP UPDATE message. Different SAFI 
   numbers are used to indicate that the message carried in BGP 
   multiprotocol extension attributes is to be handled by the VR or 
   BGP/MPLS-IP-VPN architectures.
