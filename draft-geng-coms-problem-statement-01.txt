1.  Introduction

   The concept of network slicing is not new but energized greatly under
   5G work in 3GPP.  It is expected that further 5G network should be
   capable of providing dedicated private network for different
   verticals according to their specific requirements, which are created
   by diversity of new services such as high definition (HD) video,
   virtual reality (VR) and V2X applications.  Looking at the
   development of future network, no matter the service is connected via

   5G cellular RAN, FTTx optical access network or other dedicated
   connections, this resource dedication has become a fundamental
   technology for services requiring extreme quality of user experience.
   The best effort transport is not good enough as both subscribers and
   application providers are looking for and willing to pay for certain
   level of quality dedication.  Therefore it is inevitable for service
   providers (telecommunication infrastructure owners) to rethink the
   means of management and operation of their networks, which should
   support end-to-end slicing capabilities.

   The requirements from different verticals may be extremely
   diversified.  Typical examples includes high bandwidth, low latency,
   high level of isolation, specific security and encryption
   requirements and etc.  These requirements may also change dynamically
   along time since the services of certain industry vertical changes
   very fast, and sometime spontaneously (i.e. burst bandwidth/latency
   requirement from on-line shopping provider on certain period).  It is
   expected that the configuration of certain network slice instances
   are very dynamic in a case-by-case manner.  Meanwhile, there are many
   technology options to fulfil particular requirements depending on
   considerations on many aspects including cost, TTM and etc.  The
   diversity of both requirements and technology options makes network
   slices significantly heterogeneous.

   In order to provide cost-effective and efficient network slice
   configuration, service provider needs to understand specifically the
   components it can make use to create a network slice instance and how
   these components map with the customer requirements.  These
   components include both network resources and management entities.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

1.2.  Terminology

   Network Slicing - A management mechanism that Network Slice Provider
   can use to allocate dedicated network resources from shared network
   infrastructures to Network Slice Tenant.

   Network Slice - A network slice is a managed group of dedicated
   network resources to meet certain network functionality and
   performance characteristics required by the network slice tenant(s).
   It is re-configurable and is supervised by the network slice
   provider.

   Network Slice Provider - A network slice provider (NSP), typically a
   telecommunication service provider, is the owner or tenant of the
   network infrastructures from which network slices can be created.
   The network slice provider takes the responsibilities of managing,
   orchestrating and monitoring the corresponding resources to implement
   a network slice and provide the Network slice tenant certain level of
   management.

   Network Slice Tenant - A network slice tenant (NST) is the user of
   specific network slice, in which customized services are hosted.
   Network slice tenants can make requests of the creation of new
   network slice through NSaaS platform.  This request will be delivered
   to network slice controller for implementation purposes.

2.  The Concept of Supervised Heterogeneous Network Slicing

   Network slicing is a management mechanism that an NSP can use to
   allocate dedicated network resources from shared network
   infrastructures to an NST.  This dedication may be performed in
   various forms on a diversity of resources depending on specific NSP's
   network availabilities.  Typical examples include physical and
   logical isolation of network connectivity with certain QoS
   guarantees, bare metal and virtualized computing resources, dedicated
   storage and specific pre-define network functions such as NAT server,
   SDN controller and etc.  Other network technologies such as ICN and
   CDN may also be part of the resource dedication.  Network slicing
   gives the NSP full flexibility to either logically or physically
   lease a partition of their networks to the NST with required
   functionalities and performances.

     Figure 1: The concept of supervised heterogeneous network slicing

   As network slicing is introduced to overall network management, it is
   anticipated that new business models may be created.  With a more
   flexible, elastic and modularized network, the shared network
   infrastructures can be sliced and offered as a service to end users
   and verticals.  For instance, a network slice with dedicated network
   resources with a customized topology can be provided as a service
   (NSaaS)to the NST.




Geng, et al.               Expires May 3, 2018                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft  Supervised Heterogeneous Network Slicing    October 2017


   Figure 1 illustrated the concept of how NSaaS is supervised within a
   heterogeneous network.  In this concept, a network slice can either
   be implemented according to pre-defined network slice templates or
   customized requirements.  On one hand, network slice template is
   designed by NSPs for the ease of mapping NST's request to a NSaaS
   with rather common resources and performance requirements.  This
   includes but not limited to 5G-centric services such as eMBB and
   URLLC network slices, dedicated internet VPNs for game acceleration
   and video delivery, specific vertical industrial internet dedications
   such as smart factory and so on.  On the other hand, implementing
   network slicing using customized approach provides NST with the full
   flexibility of composing its own network resource pools according to
   various requirements and constraints respectively.  As the NST
   defines a preferred network slice service either from a pre-defined
   template or full customization, a network slice service profile is
   therefore generated.

   The network slice service profile is sent to cross-segment slice
   manager, which coordinate resource from different network segment.
   The cross-segment network slice manager decomposes the network slice
   service profile and assigns corresponding segment network slice
   information to multiple network slice domain controllers.  In this
   illustration, radio access network, transport network and core
   network are used as common examples of network segments with network
   slice domain controllers.  However, it is worthy of mentioning that
   backhauling is only one of the use cases of transport segment network
   slicing.

   In the slice controller within a specific network segment, NSaaS
   information is translated to resource-level description of a network
   slice for implementation purposes.  In particular, it visualizes a
   network slice with specific resource components that comprise
   computing, storage, and generalized functions etc.  The slice
   controller also coordinates heterogeneous domain controllers/managers
   for network slice implementation.

   Although a general network slice may consist of resource components
   from various network segments, the supervised heterogeneous network
   slicing in this document refers only to IETF segment and sees the
   managed network slice a stand-alone one within IETF scope.  It may be
   used by the cross-segment network slice manager to create a more
   comprehensive end-to-end network slice including other network
   segments that are out of scope of IETF.

2.1.  Heterogeneity

   Heterogeneity is the nature of network slicing since the requests of
   NSaaS from the NST are diversified.  The slice controller has to
   supervise heterogeneous resources in various domains in response to
   NSaaS demands.  The different types of resources a network slice
   controller needs to supervise includes connectivity, storage,
   computing, generalized functions and others.  Furthermore, even for a
   single type of resources, an NSP may have difference management
   domains because of either technical or geographical variations.  For
   example, the network slice controller is supposed to have the ability
   to coordinate multiple typical existing technology domains including
   optical transport network, IP routing network and layer-2 switched
   network.  It also needs to integrate network domains with different
   management/control mechanism.  For instance, the slice controller is
   necessary to be compatible with both SDN-enabled ACTN-aware networks
   and traditional EMS-managed networks.  Another case is the management
   of virtualized resources using VIMs such as Openstack.  In order to
   provide computing/storage resource support for network slicing, these
   domains are also inevitable required to be coordinated.

   No matter it is a green field or brown field implementation, the
   network resources used to create a network slice are very likely to
   reside in different heterogeneous management domains.  The supervised
   heterogeneous network slicing provides the capability of coordination
   and orchestrate the resources from different domains.

2.2.  The requirement of general supervision of network slicing

   Supervision is required by NSP, making use of OAM tools to
   maintenance the network slice.  The slice controller needs to provide
   this capability to NSP to supervise the all the network slices that
   are implemented.

   There are varieties of reasons why supervision is crucial in the case
   the network slicing.  First of all, the network slice controller
   would not be able to deal with the lifecycle management of network
   slices without supervision abilities.  Besides, given the
   characteristic of heterogeneous environment, the network slice
   controller must be crystal clear of the underlay resource information
   that is reported and synchronized by the domain controllers/managers.
   If this is seen as a network resource capability exposure approach,
   the network slice controller must supervise this approach to define
   how this information gathered and used.  Furthermore, the network
   slice controller need to provide slice-level monitoring ability
   during the complete life circle of a network slice.  This is
   essential for the claim benefits of quality guarantee by the
   implementation of network slicing.  For example, the slice controller

Internet-Draft  Supervised Heterogeneous Network Slicing    October 2017


   need to supervise and monitor the jitter of a certain link in a
   network slice with deterministic property requirement by NST.  This
   jitter performance should also be provided to NST for SLA references.

   Last but not the least, it is common that some NST would like to
   participate in the management of its network slice.  The slice
   controller should provide this capability by using the intra-slice
   management (discussed later in section 5).  This management
   capability exposer must be supervised by NSP to avoid any resource/
   performance conflicts with other network slices.

3.  Network Resources for Supervised Heterogeneous Network Slice

   Fundamentally, network slices are created based on the shared network
   resources.  There are many existing technologies which focus on the
   management of those network resources.  For example, various type of
   domain SDN controllers supervise the connectivity resources within
   each technology or geographical domains, and MANO supervises the NFV
   infrastructures.  As previously discussed, network slicing provides a
   management mechanism for NSP to create network slices from the
   underlay resources.  It oversees all these resources and decides the
   placement of specific resources according to certain path and
   topology constraints.

   Network slicing does not have any constraints on what type of
   resources NSPs may or may not use as part of the network slice
   creation.  This is completely subjected to NSP's policy.  However,
   for the ease of management and operation, it is worthy to have a
   guideline to at least categorize the common resources that NSP may
   offer to NST as a network slice service.  The section endeavours to
   provide a prototype catalogue of the resource components for network
   slice creation.  In general, the components that an NSP can use to
   create a network slice include connectivity, computing, storage and
   generalized functions.  Other wide-scale network functionalities
   including ICN and CDN are also regarded as customized network
   resources.

3.1.  Connectivity Resources

   Connectivity is one of the essential components for a network slice.
   It can be as simple as a best effort point-to-point VPN or a physical
   link using a dedicated wavelength.  It may also have more complex
   topology with other specific requirements including bandwidth,
   latency and etc.  The characteristics of the connectivity component
   may include the following aspects.

   o  Node - The description of a network node at network slice level
      abstraction.  The abstraction level depends on the provided node



Geng, et al.               Expires May 3, 2018                  [Page 8]

Internet-Draft  Supervised Heterogeneous Network Slicing    October 2017


      resource information from the south bound interface of the
      transport network slice controller.

   o  Link - The description of a network link between two nodes in a
      network slice.

   o  Topology - The description of connection topology of a network
      slice.  It should explicitly describe the connectivity
      relationship between each access point of the network slice.  An
      NSP should be able to understand the overall connectivity
      requirement of a network slice from this topology information.

   o  Bandwidth - The description of bandwidth requirements of specific
      links within a network slice.  The requirements includes exactly
      amounts of assured bandwidth, maximum bandwidth and other
      bandwidth QoS-specific requirements

   o  Latency - The description of link latency requirements within a
      network slice.  It should identify the exact amount of latency
      between a link defined in connection topology.

   o  Determinism - The description of the determinism of a link
      latency.  This should be defined in addition to the latency, which
      further specify the jitter of the latency for a given link.

   o  Isolation level - The description of isolation level of a network
      slice.  A NST may request logical isolation which can be mapped to
      tunnelling technologies.  It may also request explicitly a
      dedicated lamda or even physical link for specific services.

3.2.  Computing Resources

   If an NST would like to host virtualized functions in a network
   slice, it may be interested in asking for specific computing resource
   including both bare metal servers and virtual machines.  The
   computing resource can be specified considering the following
   characteristics.

   o  CPU resources - The CPU specification including CPU model,
      frequency, quantity of physical/virtual CPU and etc.

   o  RAM resources - The RAM size associated with the requested
      computing resources in a network slice.

   o  Virtual resources - The pre-defined virtual resources including
      both virtual machines and containers associated with a specific
      network slice.

Internet-Draft  Supervised Heterogeneous Network Slicing    October 2017


   o  Other - This may include GPU requirements and other specific
      computing resources

3.3.  Storage Resources

   It is necessary for NSP to provide storage components in a network
   slice since NSTs may want to host contents on dedicated resources.
   Meanwhile, NSP may also prefer to use dedicated storage for specific
   service policies, authentication information and other management
   profiles.

   o  General storage - The description of storage resource in a network
      slice.  This may include the location, type, size and usage of the
      storage resource.  The general storage requirements may closely
      related to the connectivity topology as well.

   o  CDN service - If an NSP can provide a turn-key CDN solution for
      the NST.  It can also include CDN service within a network slice.

3.4.  Generalized Function Blocks

   Many dedicated network functions, either physical or virtual, may
   requested by a NST.  Typical example include common network functions
   as DHCP server, DNS, NAT, Firewall, SDN controller.  Application-
   level functions may also exist in a network slice, such as session
   management, mobility management and etc.  NSP should be able to

3.5.  Other Resources

   A category of customized resources is reserved for network slicing
   since NSPs may have unique capabilities that may be used as part of
   the network slicing to provide even greater innovative functionality.
   Resources such as ICN-aware subnet, CDN network and etc. are some t
   potential attributes in this category.

4.  The Requirement of Common Operation and Management for Supervised
    Heterogeneous Network Slice

   Network slice can only be created with resource components that are
   available in its network.  It is expected that different NSPs have
   various constraints and policies.  The abstraction of resources is
   gathered from the network configuration models whose attributes are
   maintained by heterogeneous domain controllers/managers.  Based on
   this information, a full set of resource capabilities is established.
   In order to provide network-slice-level OAM, it is extremely
   important for the heterogeneous transport network slice controller to
   visualize a network slice in terms of systematic association of these
   individual resources.  This visualization model describes the network
   slice at a resource granularity and abstraction level that are
   provided by the underlay heterogeneous domain controllers and
   managers.  It is a technology-unspecific model since how each
   partition of a network slice should map to specific resource
   capability is implementation-specific.

   In addition, the heterogeneous transport network slice controller
   receives service delivery model from the cross-segment network slice
   manager with high level network slice requirements described in the
   network slice service profile.  The service delivery model includes
   network slice service description in business view point.  Before it
   can be mapped to resources capabilities, it has to be translated to a
   network-slice level abstraction in network resource view point, with
   the compatible granularity the is exposed from the underlay resource
   capabilities.

   A common information model is required for the operation and
   management in the heterogeneous network slice controller to provide
   the above abilities.  It acts as an intermediate guideline model,
   which provides comprehensive technology-unspecific description of a
   network slice.  This model does not specify the allocation of certain
   partition of network slice to underlay technology domain or the
   mapping of certain protocol to network slice performance
   requirements.  However, it is the fundamental model that specifies
   each node, link, function blocks and corresponding performance
   requirements in an established network slice.

           Figure 2: Common Information Model in Network Slicing

   Figure 2 demonstrates the relationship between different models in
   the scope of supervised heterogeneous network slicing management.  A
   service profile is created upon the request from a NST for a network
   slice service.  This service profile is sent to cross-segment slice
   manager by global service delivery model.  The global service
   delivery model is further decomposed to various segment service
   delivery model.  In IETF's concern, the transport segment service
   delivery model is the starting point for a network-slice-aware
   service implementation.

   Within the transport domain, the service delivery model is translated
   into a common information model, which strictly aligns with the
   underlay resource constraints.  A common information model is created

   for each network slice, and it comprehensively visualizes all the
   components topologies within the slice and corresponding
   functionality and performance parameters

   In order to coordinate different technology domains to create the
   corresponding network slice, the common information model is mapped
   to network configuration models for different domains respectively.

   The common operation and management is essential for network slicing
   since a network slice consist of resource components typically from
   diversity of management domains.  There is yet a network-slice-aware
   approach that is able to orchestrate and coordinate these domains.
   The common operation and management of network slicing is designed
   for this purpose.  At the same time, there are other requirements in
   terms of heterogeneous network slice management, which are enabled by
   this approach:

   o  common resource negotiation and abstraction

   o  exchanging information between multiple management domains

   o  operations and monitoring across multiple management domains

   o  network-slice operational control (i.e. life-cycle management) and
      management capability exposure to NST

4.1.  Problem Scope

   The common information model acts as the key element in common
   operation and management of network slicing.  Foresee derivative
   including network slice monitoring, life cycle management, network
   slice interconnect, fault detection and protection mechanisms are
   also interesting and inevitable matters that supervised heterogeneous
   network slicing need to investigate.

   More work is also needed to define a north interface for the slice
   controller, we can envision how the slice controller could interface
   with existing systems (e.g. using the NFV-MANO architecture as a
   guide), and by extension delimit the scope of the slice controller
   function.

   In one scenario, the slice controller can interface with a virtual
   infrastructure manager (VIM), such as OpenStack.  The slice
   controller can in this case be considered as a lower layer component
   of the VIM, or as a network management component controlled by the
   VIM.  In another scenario, the slice controller can implement a VIM,
   and present an interface to an orchestrator.

           Figure 3: Common Information Model in Network Slicing

   Given that common information models are set up for various network
   slice.  The network-slice-level management is carried out by the
   slice controller accordingly.  Meanwhile, an intra-network-slice
   controller is need for each network slice.  The controller oversees
   the OAM of a single network slice and report to the heterogeneous
   transport network slice controller.  As per agreement between NST and
   NSP, certain capabilities of intra-slice management may be exposed to
   NST.  NST are authorized to use these capabilities to maintain its
   network slice in a view of dedicated networks and resources.  The
   network slice-level information must not be exposed, which means the
   NST should not know he existence of any other network slices through
   intra-slice manager.  The exposed controller capability should be
   supervised by the NSP, so that the network slice will not violate
   network slice-level policies.
