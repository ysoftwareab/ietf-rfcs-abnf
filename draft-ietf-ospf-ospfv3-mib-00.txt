     Abstract

     This memo defines an experimental portion  of  the  Management
     Information   Base  (MIB)  for  use  with  network  management
     protocols in IPv6-based internets. In particular,  it  defines
     objects  for  managing  the  Open  Shortest Path First Routing
     Protocol for IPv6.

     This document specifies a MIB module in a manner that is  both
     compliant to the SNMPv2 SMI, and semantically identical to the
     peer SNMPv1 definitions.

     Please send comments to ospf@discuss.microsoft.com.

     Internet-Draft            OSPFv3 MIB                 July 1999


     1.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

     The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework presently consists  of
     three major components.  They are:

     o    the SMI, described in RFC 1902 [1] - the mechanisms  used
          for  describing  and  naming  objects  for the purpose of
          management.

     o    the MIB-II, described in  RFC 1213/STD 17 [3] - the  core
          set   of  managed  objects  for  the  Internet  suite  of
          protocols.

     o    RFC 1157 [4] and RFC 1905 [5] which define  two  versions
          of  the  protocol  used  for  network  access  to managed
          objects.

     The Framework permits  new  objects  to  be  defined  for  the
     purpose of experimentation and evaluation.



     1.1.  Object Definitions

     Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information  store,
     termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the
     MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract  Syntax  Notation
     One  (ASN.1)  defined  in the SMI.  In particular, each object
     object  type  is   named   by   an   OBJECT   IDENTIFIER,   an
     administratively assigned name.  The object type together with
     an object instance serves  to  uniquely  identify  a  specific
     instantiation  of the object.  For human convenience, we often
     use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer  to  the
     object type.

     Internet-Draft            OSPFv3 MIB                 July 1999


     2.  Differences from RFC 1850

     (1)  Textual Conventions are imported from IPV6-TC  and  OSPF-
          MIB MIBs.

     (2)  The  "ospf"  prefix  for  entity  names  is  changed   to
          "ospfv3".

     (3)  General Group object name ospfVersionNumber is changed to
          ospfv3VersionNumber and its value is changed from 2 to 3.

     (4)  General Group object name ospfExternLsaCount  is  changed
          to  ospfv3AsScopeLsaCount  to  indicate  count of all AS-
          scoped LSAs in the database.

     (5)  General  Group  object  name   ospfExternLsaCksumSum   is
          changed  to ospfv3AsScopeCksumSum to indicate checksum of
          all AS-scoped LSAs in the database.

     (6)  Removed General Group object ospfTOSSupport.

     (7)  Removed ospfAuthType object from Area entry.

     (8)  Changed     object     names     ospfAreaLsaCount     and
          ospfAreaLsaCksumSum    to   ospfv3AreaScopeLsaCount   and
          ospfv3AreaScopeLsaCksumSum.

     (9)  Removed OSPF Area Default Metric Table.

     (10) Added object ospfv3StubMetric to Area entry as substitute
          for Area Default Metric Table.

     (11) Changed name of External  LSDB  Table  to  AS-Scope  LSDB
          Table.   Replaced  object  name prefix "ospfExtLsdb" with
          "ospfv3AsLsdb".

     (12) Changed name of LSDB  Table  to  Area-Scope  LSDB  Table.
          Replaced    object    name    prefix    "ospfLsdb"   with
          "ospfv3AreaLsdb".

     (13) Added ospfv3LinkLsdbTable  which  contains  all  LSAs  of
          Link-Scope.    Index   of   ospfv3LinkLsdbTable  is  IPv6
          interface index, LSA Type, Router ID and LSID.

     Internet-Draft            OSPFv3 MIB                 July 1999


     (14) Re-ordered Router ID and LSID index  components  of  LSDB
          table  entries.   Since  LSIDs  no longer have addressing
          semantics, GET-NEXT operations on partial OIDs  are  more
          useful when the Router ID component comes before the LSID
          component.

     (15) Address Range Table is removed.

     (16) Removed  ospfHostTOS  from  Host  Table   entry.   Object
          ospfHostIpAddress  changed  to ospfv3HostIpv6Address with
          SYNTAX changed from IpAddress to Ipv6Address.

     (17) Objects  ospfIfIpAddress  and  ospfAddressLessIf  removed
          from  Interface  entry and as Interface Table entry index
          components.

     (18) Object ospfv3IfIndex added to Interface Table entry  with
          SYNTAX  Ipv6IfIndex.   It  replaces  ospfIfIpAddress  and
          ospfAddressLessIf as the Interface Table entry index.

     (19) The  SYNTAX   of   objects   ospfIfDesignatedRouter   and
          ospfIfBackupDesignatedRouter is changed from IpAddress to
          RouterID.

     (20) Objects ospfIfAuthType and ospfIfAuthKey are removed from
          Interface and Virtual Interface entries.

     (21) Added     objects      ospfv3IfLinkScopeLsaCount      and
          ospfv3IfLinkLsaCksumSum to Interface entry. They maintain
          the count of Link-Scope LSAs  and  the  checksum  of  the
          Link-Scope LSA database associated with the interface.

     (22) Removed  OSPF  Interface  Metric  Table.  Metric  is  now
          accessed  via object ospfv3IfMetricValue in the Interface
          entry.

     (23) Added object ospfv3IfInstId to Interface entry to  enable
          the  setting  of  the  interface  instance  value  of the
          interface. The default value is zero.

     (24) Added object ospfv3VirtIfIndex to Virtual Interface entry
          which  is  used  to  assign  a  local interface ID to the
          virtual interface.

     (25) Added    objects    ospfv3VirtIfLinkScopeLsaCount     and
          ospfv3VirtIfLinkLsaCksumSum  to  Virtual Interface entry.
          They maintain  the  count  of  Link-Scope  LSAs  and  the
          checksum  of  the Link-Scope LSA database associated with
          the virtual interface.

     (26) Removed objects ospfNbrIpAddr and ospfNbrAddressLessIndex
          from Neighbor entry.

     (27) Added object ospfv3NbrIfIndex to Neighbor  entry.   Index
          components  ospfNbrIpAddr and ospfNbrAddressLessIndex are
          replaced with ospfv3NbrIfIndex and ospfv3NbrRtrId.

     (28) Added object ospfv3NbrIfId to Neighbor entry. This object
          contains  the  neighbor's  local interface index from the
          neighbor's hellos advertised on the link.

     (29) Added object  ospfv3VirtNbrIfIndex  to  Virtual  Neighbor
          entry.  This  is  the interface index of the virtual link
          over which the virtual neighbor is reached.

     (30) Changed     object     name     ospfVirtNbrIpAddr      to
          ospfv3VirtNbrIpv6Addr   and   SYNTAX  from  IpAddress  to
          Ipv6Address.

     (31) Added object ospfv3VirtNbrIfId to Virtual Neighbor entry.
          This  is  the  virtual neighbor's local virtual interface
          index  from  the  neighbor's  hellos  advertised  on  the
          virtual link.

     (32) Added object ospfv3AreaAggregateIndex to  Area  Aggregate
          entry.  This  allows  for  a  fixed length index for Area
          Aggregate Table entries.

     (33) Replaced      object      ospfAreaAggregateMask      with
          ospfv3AreaAggregatePrefixLen.

     (34) Replaced      object      ospfAreaAggregateNet       with
          ospfv3AreaAggregatePrefix.

     (35) Index  for  Area  Aggregate  Table  entry  changed   from
          ospfAreaAggregateAreaID,       ospfAreaAggregateLsdbType,
          ospfAreaAggregateNet,      ospfAreaAggregateMask       to
          ospfv3AreaAggregateAreaID,
          ospfv3AreaAggregateAreaLsdbType,

     Database

     The Link State  Database  is  provided  primarily  to  provide
     detailed information for network debugging.

     3.4.  Host Table

     The Host Table is  provided  to  view  configured  Host  Route
     information.

     3.5.  Interface Table

     The Interface Table describes the various IPv6 links on  which
     OSPFv3 is configured.

     3.6.  Virtual Interface Table

     The Neighbor Table and the Virtual Neighbor Table describe the
     neighbors to the OSPF Process.
