Internet-Draft         Hybrid Bridged/Routed Mode             April 2011


1.  Introduction

   A CPE (Customer Premises Equipment) router is used to forward packets
   between home networking and ISP (Internet Service Provider).  It
   connects the end-user network to PE (Provider Edge).  RFC 2684[1]
   describes two different methods for carrying traffic over an ATM
   network: routed protocol data units (PDUs) and bridged PDUs.  Today,
   the majority of the ISP deployed in home networking are in bridging
   mode.  As home networking continues to grow in popularity and
   scalability, bridged mode shows shortages to support this
   circumstance.  Routed mode would be a better solution to provide
   better service for growing home networking.

   As the growing scales of home networking, subscribers want to host
   services, such as a web server or an email server, will need a set of
   IP addresses rather than a single IP address.  The problem with this
   is that there are not enough IPv4 addresses if ISP has to provide
   public IPv4 address.  IPv6 has enough address space and could solve
   this problem.

   In the period of migrating bridged mode to routed mode, providing
   these two modes simultaneously will increase the burden of PE
   operators.  The memo provides a hybrid service model of bridged and
   routed modes in order to decrease the operating efforts.


2.  Requirement Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119[2].


3.  Scope of This Document

   Mixed environment of IPv4 only, dual-stack and IPv6 only hosts
   (behind the CPE router) can be more complex and out of the scope in
   the memo.  It only discusses IPv6-only or dual-stack which has IPv6
   nodes capability.  This service model is for home networking only,
   not for enterprise.  Every subscriber has one CPE.  Multiple CPEs'
   case is out of scope.


4.  Hybrid Model

   The service model we provide in the memo is that PE operator does not
   need to know the CPE is operating in bridging or routing mode in
   advance.  Figure 1 shows an outline of the service architecture.

                Figure 1: Hybrid Service Model Architecture

   This architecture describes the:
   o  The CPE forwards traffic between hosts and PE.
   o  The hybrid modes of CPE: bridged and routed modes.

   In a bridged environment, IPv6 addresses are allocated from PE to
   hosts directly.  The relationship between PE and hosts is router-to-
   host.  Every host establishes one connection to PE.  In PE, more
   hosts connections mean cost increasing and more complicate operating.
   In order to control cost, some ISPs restrict the number of hosts to
   access the service at one time.

   In a routed environment, IPv6 address/prefix is delegate from PE to
   CPE router.  The relationship between PE and CPE is router-to-router.
   Hosts use SLAAC[3] and DHCPv6 stateless [4] to get IPv6 addresses and
   routing information from CPE, not from PE.  There is only one
   connection between PE and CPE router.  In this mode, PE operating and
   cost is simpler and cheaper than bridged mode.


5.  IPv6 Address Provision

   The address assignment between PE and CPE is router-to-host if CPE is
   in bridging mode.  There are three methods of IPv6 address assignment
   in router-to-host connection: SLAACC + DHCPv6 stateless, RDNSS[6],
   and DHCPv6 Stateful[7].  In the first method, hosts use SLAAC to get
   IPv6 address, DHCP stateless to get DNS information.  The second
   method is to add DNS parameter in RA option.  In the third method,
   default gateway is gotten from RA and trigger hosts DHCPv6 client
   process to get IPv6 address and DNS information.  In this memo, SLAAC
   + DHCPv6 stateless is used between PE and CPE.

Internet-Draft         Hybrid Bridged/Routed Mode             April 2011


   In router-to-router connection, DHCP-PD[5] is used to delegate IPv6
   prefix to CPE.

   In Figure 1 architecture, PE operator MUST provide two different
   prefixes, one is for DHCP-PD and the other is for SLAAC.  The prefix
   length of these two methods is /64, but /60 to /63 or /48 are
   possible options.  Prefix length depends on the number of CPE's
   hosts.


6.  Conclusion

   In this service model, PE operators do not need to know CPE is in
   routed or bridged mode.  It is convenient for management, but wastes
   IPv6 addresses.  Because it would waste RA prefix if CPE is in routed
   mode, It would waste DHCP-PD prefix if CPE is in bridged mode.  But
   for PE, it is possible to recycle unused IPv6 addresses.  This
   service model exists when the ISP provides bridged and routed modes
   simultaneously.  The number of routed mode subscribers will increase
   while bridged mode subscribers will decrease during the migration
   period.  This is a transient model in order to simplify operating
   efforts and cost down.
