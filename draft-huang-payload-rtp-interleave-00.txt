1  Introduction

   Interleaving is an effective method to disperse packet loss bursts
   into a series of isolated small losses which in general are easier to
   recover from and produce lower total distortion. It provides the
   advantages of requiring no increase in bit rate and can be combined
   with other types of error-resilience techniques like FEC, but at the
   cost of increasing latency. Interleaving is quite useful for
   applications which are not such sensitive of latency in network
   environments afflicted by fading an interference which may lead to
   burst losses, e.g., DSL and wireless network.

   This memo introduces a common RTP encapsulation for interleaved
   media. This method can be applied to any RTP payload formats for any
   applications when latency is not an issue.

3. Interleaving

   An interleaver is simply used at the sender or at a middle box to
   interleave the RTP packets before transmission through the network.
   There are a lot of interleaving algorithms. A simple one could be
   that packets are firstly read into the interleaver in rows, with each
   row corresponding to a sequence block of n packets; and packets are
   transmitted by columns as soon as m rows of packets fill up. The
   interleaver permutes the packets so that the location of burst losses
   are converted into isolated ones. The effective ness of the
   interleaver depends on the block size and interleaving depth,
   however, this is at the cost of latency. At the receiver, an
   interleaved packet cannot be used until all the packets it depends on
   are received. 

   Figure 1 shows the interleaving scheme with n=4 and m=3. For this
   interleaver, the i-th packet in the original order has to be
   transmitted in the (((i-1) mod n)*m + ((i-1) div n) + 1)-th place.
   The highest decoding delay corresponding to this interleave is (n-
   1)*(m-1).

   This kind of interleaving is useful for audio applications that are
   non-interactive because it would turn a burst of consecutive lost
   packets into a series of isolated packet loss events. However, for
   video frames that are usually large enough to be fragmented into
   several packets, losing several non-consecutive packets from a large
   frame may not lead to perceptually less degradation. Thus, some
   implementations may use another interleaving to help loss recovery:
   The payload of each RTP packet is divided into n parts and the
   interleaver combines some part of one packet with some part of other
   packets to form a new RTP packet. As Figure 2 shows, each of the
   original RTP packets P1, P2, P3 and P4 are divided into 4 packets.
   The interleaver combines the first parts of P1, P2, P3 and P4
   together to form a new packet P1'. P2', P3' and P4' are formed in the
   same way. In this case, if P1' is lost during the transmission, P1,
   P2, P3 and P4 can be easily recovered by FEC mechanism.

   However, this interleaving method introduces extra complexity when
   dividing and recovering packets. To reduce delay in some degree, some
   ways can be considered. For example, the interleaver has the ability
   to categorize the RTP packets into important ones and unimportant
   ones based on some application dependent rules, and then only applies
   this interleaving to the important packets, e.g., packets containing
   I frames, IDR frames or some other information frames, while leave
   unimportant ones intact. The detail discussion of how to reduce the
   interleaving delay is out of scope of this document.

   Proposing a common interleaving RTP encapsulation allows any RTP
   payload format to use the interleaving scheme freely when needed.

4. Interleaving RTP Payload Format

   This section introduces a new PTP payload format dedicated for
   interleaving. That means interleaved RTP packets could use this new
   RTP payload format when transmitting. It is allowed that interleaving
   RTP payload format is transmitted together with the uninterleaved
   payload format so that the de-interleaver can identify the
   interleaved packets to recover. In such a case, the specifications
   defined in [draft-ietf-avtcore-multi-media-rtp-session] SHOULD be
   considered.

4.1 RTP Header

   The format of RTP header is specified in [RFC3550] and showed in
   Figure 2 for convenience.

   The RTP header information to be set according to this RTP payload
   format is set as follows:

   marker (M): 1 bit

      The interpretation of the marker is determined by the interleaved
      frame encapsulated in this payload. It MUST be set to the value
      that the market bit of the frame would have been if it were
      transported in its own RTP packets. If multiple frames are packed
      into one RTP packet, the marker bit in the RTP header MUST be set
      to the value in accordance with the last frame.

   payload type (PT): 7 bits

      The assignment of the RTP payload type for this format is outside
      the scope of this memo and will not be specified here. The
      assignment of a payload type has to be performed either through
      the profile used or in a dynamic way.

   sequence number: 16 bits

      Set and used in accordance with RFC 3550.

   timestamp: 32 bits

      Set to the value that the timestamp of the frame would have been
      if it were transported in its own RTP packets. If multiple frames
      are packed into one RTP packet, the timestamp in the RTP header
      MUST be set to the timestamp of the last frame which would have
      been if it were transported in its own RTP packets.

4.2 Payload Structure

   This section describes the interleaving payload structure. The
   interleaving payload structure is composed from a fixed interleaving
   header and one or multiple encapsulation frames, which is illustrated
   in the following figure.

      This field indicates the payload type of the encapsulation frames
      would have been if it were transported in their own RTP packets.
      Encapsulation frames with different payload type MUST NOT be
      packed into one RTP packet. The assignment of the encapsulation
      payload type has to be performed either through the profile used
      or in a dynamic way.

         Figure 4: Format for the encapsulation frame structure

   encapsulation frame type (T): 1 bit

      This field indicates the encapsulation frame type.

         T=0: Last encapsulation frame - This frame can be used alone or
         as the last encapsulation frame in an aggregation RTP packet
         which combines multiple encapsulation frames.

         T=1: Aggregated encapsulation frame - This frame MUST be only
         used in an aggregation RTP packet combining multiple
         encapsulation frame. And it MUST NOT be used as the last
         encapsulation frame when used in the aggregation RTP packet.

   SN Offset: 8 bits

      This field records the signed offset between the original sequence
      number that the encapsulation frame would have been if it were
      transported in its own RTP packets and the sequence number field
      in this RTP header. The original sequence number implying the
      decoding order can be calculated as following:

         original sequence number = sequence number + SN offset

      A negative SN offset indicates that the encapsulation frame is
      delayed for transmission, and a non-negative SN offset means the
      encapsulation frame is transmitted ahead of it should be. 

      If multiple encapsulation frames combined in one RTP packet have
      the same SN offset, they SHOULD be handled according to their
      orders arranged in this packet.

   timestamp offset: 23 bits

      This field records the signed offset between the original
      timestamp that the encapsulation frame would have been if it were
      transported in its own RTP packets and the timestamp field in this
      RTP header. It is only applicable for aggregated encapsulation
      frame (T=1). The original timestamp can be calculated as
      following:

         original timestamp = timestamp + timestamp offset

   size: 16 bits

      This field is an unsigned size information of the following
      encapsulation frame, which does not include encapsulation frame
      type, SN offset and timestamp offset. It is only applicable for
      aggregated encapsulation frame (T=1).

4.4 Example Packet

   This section presents two example of an interleaving RTP packet.
   Figure 5 shows an example of an packet that only contain one
   encapsulation frame. In this example, the original timestamp is the
   timestamp in the RTP header.
