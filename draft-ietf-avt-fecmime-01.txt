Abstract

   The RTP payload format for generic forward error correction allows
   RTP participants to improve loss resiliency through the use of
   traditional parity based channel codes. This payload format requires
   four new MIME types, audio/parityfec, video/parityfec, text/parityfec
   and application/parityfec. This document serves as the MIME type
   registration for those formats.


1 Introduction

   The RTP payload format for generic forward error correction [1]
   allows RTP participants to improve loss resiliency through the use of
   traditional parity based channel codes. This payload format requires
   four new MIME types, audio/parityfec, video/parityfec,
   text/paritfyfec and application/parityfec. RFC 2048 [2] defines

   procedures for registration of new MIME types within the IETF tree.
   Furthermore, the Audio/Video Transport working group has defined
   additional procedures that must be followed when registering RTP
   payload formats [3]. This document serves as the MIME type
   registration for those formats based on those procedures.

2 Registration of audio/parityfec

        To: ietf-types@iana.org

        Subject: Registration of MIME media type audio/parityfec

        MIME media type name: audio

        MIME subtype name: parityfec

        Required parameters: none

             Note that [3] mandates that RTP payload formats without a
             defined rate must define a rate parameter as part of their
             MIME registration. The payload format for generic forward
             error correction [1] does not specify a rate parameter.
             However, the rate for FEC data is equal to the rate of the
             media data it protects.


        Optional parameters: none

             Typical optional parameters [3], such as the number of
             channels, and the duration of audio per packet, do not
             apply to FEC data. The number of channels is effectively
             the same as the media data it protects; the same is true
             for the duration of audio per packet.


        Encoding considerations: This format is only defined for
             transport within the Real Time Transport protocol (RTP)
             [4,5]. Its transport within RTP is fully specified with RFC
             2733 [1].


        Security considerations: none


        Interoperability considerations: none


        Published specification: This MIME typed is described fully

        Applications which use this media type: Audio and video
             streaming tools which seek to improve resiliency to loss by
             sending additional data with the media stream.

4 Registration of text/parityfec

        MIME media type name: text

             defined rate must define a rate parameter as part of their
