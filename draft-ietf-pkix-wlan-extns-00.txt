Internet-Draft     Wireless LAN Certificate Extensions          May 2002


1. Introduction

   Several Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) [EAP] authentication
   methods employ certificates.  For example, EAP-TLS [EAP-TLS] can be
   used with PPP [PPP] as well as IEEE 802.1X [802.1X].  PPP is used for
   dial-up and VPN environments.  IEEE 802.1X defines port-based,
   network access control, and it is used to provide authenticated
   network access for Ethernet, Token Ring, and Wireless LANs (WLANs)
   [802.11].

   Automated selection of certificates for PPP and IEEE 802.1X clients
   is highly desirable.  By using certificate extensions to identify the
   intended environment for a particular certificate, the need for user
   input is minimized.  Further, the certificate extensions facilitate
   the separation of administrative functions associated with
   certificates used for different environments.

   IEEE 802.1X can be used for authentication with multiple networks.
   For example, the same wireless station might use IEEE 802.1X to
   authenticate to a corporate IEEE 802.11 WLAN and a public IEEE 802.11
   "hotspot."  Each of these IEEE 802.11 WLANs has a different network
   name, called Service Set Identifier (SSID).  If the network operators
   have a roaming agreement, then cross realm authentication allows the
   same certificate to be used on both networks.  However, if the
   networks do not have a roaming agreement, then the IEEE 802.1X client
   needs select a certificate for the current network environment.
   Including a list of SSIDs in a certificate extension facilitates
   automated selection of an appropriate certificate without human user
   input.

1.1. Conventions Used In This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [STDWORDS].

1.2. Abstract Syntax Notation

   All X.509 certificate [X.509-97] extensions are defined using ASN.1
   [X.208-88, X.209-88].

2. EAP Extended Key Usage Values

   RFC 3280 [PROFILE] specifies the extended key usage X.509 certificate
   extension.  The extension indicates one or more purposes for which
   the certified public key may be used.  The extended key usage
   extension can be used in conjunction with key usage extension, which
   indicates the intended purpose of the certified public key.  For

   example, the key usage extension might indicate that the certified
   public key ought to be used only for validating digital signatures.

   The extended key usage extension definition is repeated here for
   convenience:

      id-ce-extKeyUsage OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-ce 37}

      ExtKeyUsageSyntax ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF KeyPurposeId

      KeyPurposeId ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER

   This specification defines two KeyPurposeId values: one for EAP over
   PPP, and one for EAP over LAN (EAPOL).  Inclusion of the EAP over PPP
   value indicates that the certified public key is appropriate for use
   with EAP in the PPP environment, and the inclusion of the EAPOL value
   indicates that the certified public key is appropriate for use with
   the EAP in the LAN environment.  Inclusion of both values indicates
   that the certified public key is appropriate for use in either of the
   environments.

      id-kp-eapOverPPP  OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=  { id-kp- <TBD> }

      id-kp-eapOverLAN  OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=  { id-kp- <TBD> }

   The extended key usage extension may, at the option of the
   certificate issuer, be either critical or non-critical.  If the
   extension is marked as critical, then the certified public key MUST
   be used only for the purposes indicated.  However, if the extension
   is marked as non-critical, then extended key usage extension MAY be
   used to support the location of an appropriate certified public key.

   If a certificate contains both a critical key usage extension and a
   critical extended key usage extension, then both extensions MUST be
   processed independently, and the certificate MUST only be used for a
   purpose consistent with both extensions.  If there is no purpose
   consistent with both critical extensions, then the certificate MUST
   NOT be used for any purpose.

3. WLAN SSID Extension

   The Wireless LAN (WLAN) System Service identifiers (SSIDs)
   certificate extension is always non-critical.  It contains a list of
   SSIDs.  When more than one certificate includes an extended key usage
   extension indicating that the certified public key is appropriate for
   use with the EAP in the LAN environment, the list of SSIDs MAY be
   used to select the correct certificate for authentication in a
   particular LAN environment.

   The WLAN SSID extension is identified by id-pe-wlanSSID.

      id-pe-wlanSSID  OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=  { id-pe- <TBD> }

   The syntax for the WLAN SSID extension is:

      SSIDList  ::=  SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF SSID

      SSID  ::=  OCTET STRING (SIZE (1..32))

4. Security Considerations

   The procedures and practices employed by the certification authority
   (CA) MUST ensure that the correct values for the extended key usage
   extension and SSID extension are inserted in each certificate that is
   issued.  Relying parties may accept or reject a particular
   certificate for an intended use based on the information provided in
   these extensions.  Incorrect representation of the information in
   either extension could cause the relying party to reject an otherwise
   appropriate certificate or accept a certificate that ought to be
   rejected.
