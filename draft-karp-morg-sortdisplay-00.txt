1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   The [SORT] extension to the [IMAP] protocol provides a means for
   server-based sorting of messages.  It defines a set of sort criteria
   and the mechanism for determining the sort value of a message for
   each such ordering.

   The [SORT] extension's FROM ordering sorts messages lexically on the
   [IMAP] addr-part of the first address in the From header.  This
   document provides an alternate ordering, DISPLAYFROM, which sorts
   messages lexically based on the From address's [RFC2822] display-
   name, when present.

   A server that supports the DISPLAYFROM sort criterion indicates this
   by returning "SORT=DISPLAYFROM" in its CAPABILITY response.


3.  The DISPLAYFROM Sort Key

   This document introduces a new [SORT] sort-key, DISPLAYFROM.

   A message's sort value under the DISPLAYFROM ordering MUST be derived
   from the first [RFC2822] mailbox in its From header as follows:

   o  If the From header is absent or if the header contains no
      mailboxes, the message's sort value is the empty string.

   o  If the mailbox contains an [RFC2822] display-name, replace each
      instance of [RFC2822] CFWS in the display-name with a single
      space, trim all leading and trailing whitespace, and decode any
      [RFC2047] encoded-words.  If the resulting string is not the empty
      string, use it as the sort value for the message.

   o  Otherwise, completely remove all [RFC2822] CFWS from the mailbox's
      [RFC2822] addr-spec and use the resulting string as the message's
      sort value.

4.  Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (ABNF) notation as specified in [RFC2234].  [IMAP] defines the
   non-terminal "capability" and [SORT] defines "sort-key".

capability    =/ "SORT=DISPLAYFROM"

sort-key      =/ "DISPLAYFROM"


5.  Security Considerations

   This document defines an additional IMAP4 capability.  As such, it
   does not change the underlying security considerations of [IMAP].
   The author believes that no new security issues are introduced with
   this additional IMAP4 capability.


6.  Internationalization Considerations

   DISPLAYFROM is a string-based sort criterion.  As stated in [SORT],
   the collations mandated by I18NLEVEL=1 or I18NLEVEL=2 from [RFC5255]
   MUST be followed when sorting such strings.

   The DISPLAYFROM ordering sorts on the full decoded [RFC2822] display-
   name, when present.  It does not attempt to parse this string in a
   locale- or language-dependent manner in order to determine and sort
   on some semantically meaningful substring such as the surname.


7.  IANA Considerations

   [IMAP] capabilities are registered by publishing a standards track or
   IESG-approved experimental RFC.  This document constitutes
   registration of the SORT=DISPLAYFROM capability in the [IMAP]
   capabilities registry.
