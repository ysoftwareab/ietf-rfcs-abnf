Abstract

   The Service Location Protocol provides a scalable framework for the
   discovery and selection of network services.  Using this protocol,
   computers using IP based networks no longer need so much static
   configuration of network services for network based applications.
   This is especially important as computers become more portable, and
   users less tolerant of or less able to fulfill the demands of network
   administration.

   The Service Location Protocol, Version 2 is well defined for use over
   IPv4 networks [3]:  This document defines its use over IPv6 networks.
   Since this protocol relies on UDP and TCP, the changes to support its
   use over IPv6 are minor.

   This document does not describe how to use SLPv1 [2] over IPv6
   networks.  There is at the time of this publication no implementation
   or deployment of SLPv1 over IPv6.  It is RECOMMENDED that SLPv2 be
   used in general, and specifically on networks which support IPv6.

1. Protocol Changes

   The following are  changes required to have the Service Location
   Protocol work over IPv6.  These changes include:

      - Eliminating support for broadcast SLP requests

      - Restricted Propagation of Link Local Addresses

      - Address Specification for IPv6 Addresses in URLs

      - Different multicast addresses


2. Eliminating support for broadcast SLP requests

   Service Location over IPv4 allows broadcasts to send Service Location
   request messages.  IPv6 makes use of link layer multicast in place of
   broadcast.  Broadcast only configuration for SLP is not supported
   under IPv6. If a User Agent wishes to make a request to discover
   Directory Agents or make a request of multiple Service Agents, the
   User Agent must multicast the request to the appropriate multicast
   address.

   This change modifies the requirements described in Section 6.1 (Use
   of Ports, UDP and Multicast) of the Service Location Protocol [3].

3. Restricted Propagation of Link Local Addresses

   Link local advertisements MUST NOT be used if the SLP Agent has a
   routable address.  Service advertisements will include routable
   addresses in this case.

   Further, without routable addresses all User Agents (UAs), Service
   Agents (SAs) and Directory Agents (DAs) transmit multicast SLP
   messages with a TTL of 1:  This includes SrvRqst, AttrRqst,
   SrvTypeRqst and unsolicited DAAdvert messages.  This request is
   transmitted using a link local scope multicast address.

   If the SA has no routable address it may send a Service Registration
   to a DA using its Link Local address. This may occur in an
   environment where there is no router available. This address must be
   specified in the Service URL using an IPv6 address specification (see
   below.)

   A DA or SA MAY return URLs in SrvRply messages which contain link
   local IPv6 addresses to UAs, but only with several restrictions.

       1. The DA or SA is not be multihomed such that one interface
          has a link local address.

       2. The DA or SA is not configured with a routable address.

       3. The SA and DA listens only for link local multicast
          requests.  (The DA will listen for multicast DA discovery
          requests.  The SA will listen for various multicast requests.)

If multihomed agents or routable addresses are desired for SLP with
   IPv6, a router MUST be deployed on the network.


4. Address Specification for IPv6 Addresses in URLs

   When ever possible the DNS [4] name of the service should be used rather
   than the above representation.

   Service Location allows the use of the protocol without the benefit
   of DNS.  This is relevant when a group of systems is connected to
   build a network without any previous configuration of servers to
   support this network.  When Service Location is used in this manner,
   numerical addresses must be used to identify the location of services.

   The format of a "service:" URL is defined in [5].  This URL is an
   ``absolute URI'' as defined by [6].

   A numerical IPv6 address,
   such as may be used in a "service:" URL, is specified as
   in [7].  The textual representation defined for literal IPv6 addresses

   in [8]:

        ipv6-addr  =  "[" num-addr "]"
        num-addr   =  ; Text represented IPv6 address syntax is as
                      ; specified in RFC 2373 [8], Section 2.2,

   Examples:

      This is a site local scoped address, as could be used in a
      SLP DAAdvert message.

        service:directory-agent://[FEC0::A3F9:251C:1291:109D]

      This is a link local scoped address, as could be used by a SA
      to advertise its service on a IPv6 network with no routers or
      DNS service.

        service:printer:ipp://[FE80::015A:93C0:D85D:B098]:8080/path


5. SLP multicast behavior over IPv6

   SLPv2 agents MUST use the site local scope for transmission of
   multicast messages, unless configured to use a more restrictive scope
   (for example, the link local scope).

5.1 SLPv2 Multicast Addresses for IPv6

   SLPv2 for IPv4 specifies only one multicast address.  The reason only
   one address was used, is that there are only 255 relative assignments
   available for the Administratively Scoped Addresses [10].  IPv6, on
   the other hand, has scoped addresses and enough range for static
   assignments.

   SLPv2 for IPv6 uses the following multicast address assignments:

           FF0X:0:0:0:0:0:0:116     SVRLOC               [Veizades]
           FF0X:0:0:0:0:0:0:123     SVRLOC-DA            [Veizades]
           FF05:0:0:0:0:0:1:1000    Service Location     [RFC2165]
            -FF05:0:0:0:0:0:1:13FF

   The SVRLOC address is used for the following messages: Service
   Type Request and Attribute Request messages.

   The SVRLOC-DA address is used for multicast Service Requests for
   the "service:directory-agent" service type.  DAs send unsolicited
   DA Advert messages to the SVRLOC-DA multicast address.

   All other multicast Service Request messages are sent to the
   appropriate Service Location multicast address.  SAs join the groups
   which correspond to the Service Types of the services they advertise.

   The address is determined using the algorithm provided in SLPv1.  The
   Service Type string used in the SrvRqst is hashed to a value from
   0-1023.  This determines the offset into the FF05::1:1000-13FF range.

   An unsigned 32 bit value V is initialized to 0.  Each byte of the
   Service Type UTF-8 [11] encoded string value is considered
   consecutively.  First, the value V is multiplied by 33, then the
   value of the current string byte is added.  The result is contained
   in the low order 10 bits of V.

6. Security Considerations

   User Agents and Directory Agents MAY ignore all unauthenticated
   Service Location messages when a valid IPSec association exists.

   Service Agents and Directory Agents MUST be able to use the IP
   Authentication and IP Encapsulating Security Payload in Service
   Location messages whenever an appropriate IPSec Security Association
   exists. [12]

   SLP allows digital signatures to be produced to allow the
   verification of the contents of messages.  There is nothing
   in the Modifications for IPv6 document which weakens or
   strengthens this technique.
