Abstract

   AAA servers, such as RADIUS and DIAMETER, are in use within the
   Internet today to provide authentication and authorization services
   for dial-up computers.  Mobile IP requires strong authentication
   between the mobile node and its home agent.  When the mobile node
   shares a security association with its home AAA server, however, it
   is possible to use that security association to create derivative
   security associations between the mobile node and its home agent,
   and again between the mobile node and the foreign agent currently
   offering connectivity to the mobile node.  This document specifies
   extensions to the Mobile IP Registration Reply packet that can be
   used to create such security information at the mobile node.

Internet Draft            AAA Keys for Mobile IP            20 July 2001


1. Introduction

   AAA servers, such as RADIUS [13] and DIAMETER [4], are in use within
   the Internet today to provide authentication and authorization
   services for dial-up computers.  Such services are likely to be
   equally valuable for mobile nodes using Mobile IP when the nodes
   are attempting to connect to foreign domains with AAA servers.
   Mobile IP [11] requires strong authentication between the mobile
   node and its home agent.  When the mobile node shares a security
   association with its home AAA server, however, it is possible to use
   that security association to create derivative security associations
   between the mobile node and its home agent, and again between the
   mobile node and the foreign agent currently offering connectivity to
   the mobile node.  This document specifies extensions to the Mobile
   IP Registration messages that can be used to create those security
   associations at the mobile node.

   AAA servers typically use the Network Access Identifier (NAI) [1]
   to uniquely identify the mobile node; the mobile node's home
   address is not always necessary to provide that function.  Thus,
   it is possible for a mobile node to authenticate itself, and be
   authorized for connection to the foreign domain, without having any
   home address.  However, for Mobile IP to work, the mobile node is
   required to have a security association with its home agent.  When
   the Mobile IP Registration Reply packet is authenticated by the
   MN-AAA Authentication Extension [3], the mobile node can verify that
   the keys contained in the extensions were produced by the AAA server,
   and thus may be reliably used to create security associations with
   the home agent, or alternatively with the foreign agent.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [2].


2. Scope of Protocol

   The protocol and messages in this document are intended to facilitate
   the following operations which may occur between the mobile node, AAA
   server, home agent, and foreign agent.

    1. When a mobile node travels away from home, it may not have a
       security association with its home agent, perhaps because it does
       not yet have a home address.

    2. If the mobile node does not have a Mobility Security Association
       with the foreign agent, it SHOULD include an MN-FA Key Request
       extension.




Perkins, Calhoun            Expires 20 January 2002             [Page 2]

Internet Draft            AAA Keys for Mobile IP            20 July 2001


    3. Similarly, if the mobile node does not have a Mobility Security
       Association with the home agent, it MUST add an MN-HA Key Request
       extension.

    4. If one or more Key Request extensions were added, the MN-AAA
       Authentication extension is added to the Registration Request.

    5. At the time the information within the MN-AAA Authentication
       extension is verified by the AAA server, the AAA server also
       generates Key Material for the keys requested by the mobile node,
       and causes insertion of the Key Material fields along with the
       Registration Reply.

    6. The respective AAA keys are distributed to the Home and Foreign
       Agent via the AAA protocol.

    7. If the Reply passes authentication and contains the Unsolicited
       MN-HA Key Material From AAA extension (see section 6), the mobile
       node generates the key using the Key Material provided, according
       to its security association with the AAA. The resulting key is
       used to establish the mobile node's security association with its
       home agent, and is used to authenticate the MN-HA authentication
       extension.

    8. Similarly, if the Reply passes authentication and contains
       the Unsolicited MN-FA Key Material From AAA extension (see
       section 5), the mobile node generates the key using the Key
       Material provided, according to its security association with the
       AAA. The resulting key is used to establish the mobile node's
       security association with its new foreign agent, and is used to
       compute the authentication data used in the MN-FA authentication
       extension.

   Any registration reply containing the Unsolicited MN-HA Key Material
   From AAA extension MUST also contain a subsequent Mobile Home
   Authentication Extension, created using the generated MN-HA key.
   Similarly, a reply containing the Unsolicited MN-FA Key Material
   From AAA extension MUST also contain a subsequent Mobile Foreign
   Authentication Extension, created using the the MN-FA key.


3. Dynamic Security Associations

   Mobility Security Associations between Mobile IP entities
   (mobile nodes, home agents, foreign agents) contain both the
   necessary cryptographic key information, and a way to identify
   the cryptographic algorithm which uses the key to produce the
   authentication information typically included in the Mobile Home
   Authentication extension or the Mobile Foreign Authentication

   extension.  In order for the mobile node to make use of key
   information sent to it by the AAA server, the mobile node also has to
   be able to select the appropriate cryptographic algorithm that uses
   the key to produce the authentication.  The following table contains
   the supported algorithm identifiers.

      Algorithm Identifier   Name                Reference
      ---------------------  ------------------  ------------
      1                      MD5/prefix+suffix   RFC 2002 [11]
      2                      HMAC MD5            RFC 2104 [6]
      3                      SHA-1               FIPS 180-1 [10]



   New algorithms will be allocated as indicated by practical experience
   using the extensions defined in this document.

   Dynamic Mobility Security Associations shared between mobile nodes
   and home agents also requires a replay protection method.  The
   following table contains the supported replay methods.
      Replay Method     Name           Reference
      --------------    ------------   --------------
      1                 None           RFC 2002 [11]
      2                 Timestamps     RFC 2002 [11]
      3                 Nonces         RFC 2002 [11]




4. Key Material Creation and Derivation

   This section contains the procedures followed in the creation of the
   Key Material by AAA servers, and the key derivation procedures used
   by mobile nodes.  Note that the AAA servers will also make use of the
   derivation procedures to deliver the keys via the AAA protocol.

   The example that follows makes use of MD5 in prefix+suffix mode,
   whose support is mandatory in Mobile IP [11].  Other cryptographic
   functions, such as those listed in 3 MAY also be used.

    1. The AAA server identifies the mobile node's via a
       ``node-address''.  If the Home Address field of the
       Registration Request is zero (0), the Mobile Node's NAI is used
       instead.

    2. The AAA server generates a random [5] value of at least 64 bits.

    3. The AAA server inserts the random value into the Key extension in
       the ``Key Material'' field.

    4. The mobile node calculates

          key = MD5(AAA-key | Key Material | node-address | AAA-key)

    5. The mobile node creates the dynamic security association, using
       the key, and the other relevant information in the Key Extension.

   Extension [12].  The Key Material is added by the home domain AAA
   server (AAAH) for use by the mobile node in creating the MN-FA key,
   which is used to secure future Mobile IP registrations with the same
   foreign agent.  The Unsolicited MN-FA Key Material From AAA extension
   MUST appear in the Registration Reply before the MN-FA Authentication
   extension.

   Once the mobile node creates the FA Security Information, by using
   the algorithm indexed by the AAA SPI, it stores the FA Security
   Information indexed by the FA SPI in its list of Mobile Security
   Associations.

   If the foreign agent receives a Registration Reply that has no
   Unsolicited MN-FA Key Material From AAA extension, and thus cannot
   establish a Mobility Security Association with the mobile node, the
   foreign agent MAY change the Code value of the Registration Reply to
   MISSING_MN_FA (see section 9), effectively causing the registration
   to fail.


6. Unsolicited MN-HA Key Material From AAA Subtype

   The Unsolicited MN-HA Key Material From AAA is subtype 1 of the
   Generalized MN-HA Key Reply Extension [12].

   registrations with its home agent.  The MN-HA Key Reply MUST appear
   in the Registration Reply before the MN-HA Authentication extension.

   Once the mobile node creates the MN-HA Key, by using the algorithm
   specified in the AAA SPI, it stores the HA Security Information
   indexed by the HA SPI in its list of Mobile Security Associations.
   The mobile node uses the Identification field data from the
   Registration Request as its initial synchronization data with the
   home agent.


7. MN-FA Key Request From AAA Subtype

   The MN-FA Key Request From AAA subtype data uses subtype 7 of the
   Generalized MN-FA Key Request Extension [12].  The MN-FA Key Request
   From AAA extension MUST appear in the Registration Request before the
   MN-AAA Authentication extension.  The subtype data field is zero in
   length.


8. MN-HA Key Request From AAA Subtype

   The MN-HA Key Request From AAA subtype data uses subtype 7 of the
   Generalized MN-HA Key Request Extension [12].  The MN-HA Key Request
   From AAA extension MUST appear in the Registration Request before the

   length.


9. Error Values

   Each entry in the following table contains the name of Code [11] to
   be returned in a Registration Reply, the value for the Code, and the
   section in which the error is first mentioned in this specification.

      Error Name               Value   Section
      ----------------------   -----   ---------
      MISSING_MN_FA            107     5



10. IANA Considerations

   The number for the Generalized MN-HA Key Reply Extension is
   taken from the numbering space defined for Mobile IP registration
   extensions defined in RFC 2002 [11] as extended in RFC 2356 [8].

   The number 7, assigned to the Unsolicited MN-HA Key Material From AAA
   Subtype extension, was taken from the numbering space defined for the
   Generalized MN-HA Key Reply Extension, defined in [12].

   The number 7, assigned to the MN-FA Key Request From AAA Subtype
   extension, was taken from the numbering space defined for the
   Generalized MN-FA Key Request Extension, defined in [12].

   The number 1, assigned to the Unsolicited MN-FA Key Material From AAA
   Subtype extension, was taken from the numbering space defined for the
   Generalized MN-FA Key Reply Extension, defined in [12].

   The number 7, assigned to the MN-HA Key Request From AAA Subtype
   extension, was taken from the numbering space defined for the
   Generalized MN-HA Key Request Extension, defined in [12].

   The Code values specified for errors, listed in section 9, MUST NOT
   conflict with any other code values listed in RFC 2002, RFC 3024 [7],
   or RFC 2356 [8].  They are to be taken from the space of error values
   conventionally associated with rejection by the foreign agent (i.e.,
   64-127).

   Section 3 introduces the Algorithm Identifier namespace that requires
   IANA management.  This specification makes use of 1-3; all other
   values other than zero (0) are available for assignment, pending
   review and approval by a Designated Expert [9].

   Section 3 introduces the Replay Method Identifier namespace that
   requires IANA management.  This specification makes use of 1-3;
   all other values other than zero (0) are available for assignment,
   pending review and approval by a Designated Expert [9].


11. Security Considerations

   The extensions in this document are intended to provide the
   appropriate level of security for Mobile IP entities (mobile node,
   foreign agent, and home agent) to operate Mobile IP registration
   protocol.  The security associations resulting from use of these
   extensions do not offer any higher level of security than what is
   already implicit in use of the security association between the
   mobile node and the AAA.

   Since the extensions defined in this specification only carries Key
   Material, which is used to derive keys, it does not expose any data
   that could be used in an attack aimed at recovering the key shared
   between the mobile node and the AAA. The authors do not believe this
   specification introduces new security risks.
