 Abstract 
    
   Type-length-value structures have made their way into the messages 
   distributed opaquely by OSPF. This document specifies an 
   interoperable method to add vendor specific extensions to existing 
   message structures.

 1. Introduction 
    
   OSPF can build a Traffic Engineering database for a node using the 
   mechanisms defined in [OSPF-TE] and [OSPF-G]. The TE LSAs that make 
   up the database are encoded in a Type-Length-Value, TLV, format. This 
   encoding scheme is very flexible and allows for a wide range of 
   extensions. Organizations at the forefront of the TE and GMPLS 
   technology are able, within the framework, to define their own set of 
   (sub-)TLVs for specific extensions that only they can/want to 
   support. 
    
   This document defines an encoding for a vendor TLV that uniquely 
   identifies the organization, so that there is no risk of collision in 
   picking a value from the type range reserved for vendor specific 
   extensions. The unique identifier specified to distinguish a 
   particular vendor is the vendors/organizations SMI Network management 
   enterprise code. 
    
   This encoding method for vendor specific data simplifies the process 
   of defining the vendor TLV by eliminating the need of an Expert 
   Review and the redundant registration of the vendor with IANA. 
    
    
 2. Vendor Attributes TLV format 
    
   The vendor attribute TLV, or in short the vendatt TLV, has a sub-TLV 
   type defined in the scope of the parent TLV. The sections below 
   define the values in the scope of the TE LSA Router Address and Link 
   top level TLVs. 
    
   The length in the vendatt TLV represents the total length of the 
   value field. The length must be at least 4. 
    
   The value field MUST contain the SMI Network management enterprise 
   code for the vendor or organization, encoded as a 32 bit value in 
   network byte order. The enterprise code MAY be followed by an 
   arbitrary set of bytes encoded in a TLV or other choice of format, as 
   the organization decides.  
    
   The vendatt TLV format is defined below:

 2.1 Vendor Attributes in the Router Address TLV 
    
   The vendatt TLV can be used as a sub-TLV in the Router Address TLV. 
   The sub-TLV type 1(TBD-IANA)is assigned for this purpose. In tabular 
   form the sub-TLVs defined in this memo for use in the Router Address 
   TLV are: 
    
   Sub-TLV Type      Length    Name 
         (TBD)1    variable    Vendor Attributes 
    
    
 2.2 Vendor Attributes in the TE Link TLV 
    
   The vendatt TLV can be used as a sub-TLV in the Link TLV. The sub-TLV 
   type 17(TBD-IANA)is assigned for this purpose. In tabular form the 
   sub-TLVs defined in this memo for use in the Link TLV are: 
    
   Sub-TLV Type      Length    Name 
        (TBD)17    variable    Vendor Attributes 
    
    
    
 3. Compatibility issues 
    
   The mechanism introduced in this memo makes it possible for: 
      - a vendor∆s equipment to identify their sub-TLVs as assigned to 
        it 
      - a vendor∆s equipment to ignore other-vendor∆s sub-TLVs 
      - a network operator to avoid unintended side-effects of multi-
        vendor TE networks 
    
   Routers that do not implement these extensions are expected to 
   silently ignore the unknown TLVs.

 Security Considerations 
    
   The extensions proposed in this document do not raise any new 
   security concerns. However, as the content of the vendor specific 
   data is opaque to the mechanism, it is left the specific vendor or 
   organization to consider their security requirements and solutions. 
   Some usages would prefer for the data to be in the clear, for others 
   security through obscurity might be enough, and yet other 
   applications might require the use of more powerful security 
   concepts. 
    
    
 IANA Considerations 
    
   This memo introduces one new sub-TLV of the Router Address TLV in the 
   TE Opaque LSA for OSPFv2. 
    
   This memo also introduces one new sub-TLV of the TE Link TLV in the 
   TE Opaque LSA for OSPFv2. [OSPF-TE] says that the sub-TLVs of the TE 
   link TLV in the range of 10-32767 must be assigned by Expert Review 
   and must be registered with IANA.
