     Registration of Charset and Languages Media Features Tags

Status of this memo

This document is an Internet-Draft and is in full conformance with all
provisions of Section 10 of RFC2026.

Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering Task
Force (IETF), its areas, and its working groups.  Note that other
groups may also distribute working documents as Internet-Drafts.

Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months
and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any
time.  It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference material

Abstract

This document contains the registration for two media features:
"charset" and "language". These media features allow specification of
character sets and human languages that can be understood by devices
and the devices' users. The templates in this document are derived from
[TAG-REG].
                                   
1. Registration for charset

To: media-feature-tags@apps.ietf.org (Media feature tags mailing list)
Subject: Registration of media feature tag charset

Media feature tag name:
    charset

ASN.1 identifier associated with feature tag:
    None requested

Summary of the media feature indicated by this feature tag:
    Ability to display particular charsets as defined in [CHARSET]

Values appropriate for use with this feature tag:
  [x] 2. The feature has an associated numeric or enumerated value.
   [x] 2e. String (equality relationship)

(Only for case 2) Detailed description of the feature value meaning,
and of the format and meaning of the feature tag values for the
alternative results.
    The values are strings as defined in [CHARSET]. The values can only
	be compared for equality.

The feature tag is intended primarily for use in the following
applications, protocols, services, or negotiation mechanisms:
    Any protocol that used media tags

Examples of typical use:
    (| (charset=utf-8);q=1.0 (charset=iso-8859-1);q=.9
       (charset=utf-16);q=.5 )

Related standards or documents:
    "IANA Charset Registration Procedures", RFC 2278

Considerations particular to use in individual applications,
protocols, services, or negotiation mechanisms:
    None

Interoperability considerations:
    None

Security considerations:
    If it is known that there is a security bug in the display
    of a particular charset in a particular environment, knowing
    that a device can accept that charset may slightly help an
    attacker.

Additional information:
    None

Name(s) & email address(es) of person(s) to contact for
further information:
    Paul Hoffman <phoffman@imc.org>

Intended usage:
    COMMON

Author/Change controller:
    Paul Hoffman <phoffman@imc.org>

Requested IANA publication delay:
    None

Other information:
    None

2. Registration for language

To: media-feature-tags@apps.ietf.org (Media feature tags mailing list)
Subject: Registration of media feature tag language

Media feature tag name:
    language

ASN.1 identifier associated with feature tag:
    None requested

Summary of the media feature indicated by this feature tag:
    Ability to display particular human languages as defined in [LANG].
    Note that "display" in this case will most often mean speech
    by a computer.

Values appropriate for use with this feature tag:
  [x] 2. The feature has an associated numeric or enumerated value.
   [x] 2e. String (equality relationship)

(Only for case 2) Detailed description of the feature value meaning,
and of the format and meaning of the feature tag values for the
alternative results.
    The values are strings as defined in [LANG]. The values can only
	be compared for equality. As described in [LANG], language tags
    are always handled as a single token, and "subtags" are not
    used for comparison.

The feature tag is intended primarily for use in the following
applications, protocols, services, or negotiation mechanisms:
    Any protocol that used media tags

Examples of typical use:
    (| (language=no-nynorsk);q=1.0 (language=no-bokmaal);q=.9
       (language=i-sami-no);q=.5 )

Related standards or documents:
    "Tags for the Identification of Languages", RFC 1766

Considerations particular to use in individual applications,
protocols, services, or negotiation mechanisms:
    None

Interoperability considerations:
    None

Security considerations:
    If it is known that there is a security bug in the display
    of a particular language in a particular environment, knowing
    that a device can accept that language may slightly help an
    attacker.

Additional information:
