                  draft-ietf-ntp-update-registries-03

Abstract

   The Network Time Protocol (NTP) and Network Time Security (NTS)
   documents define a number of assigned number registries, collectively
   called the NTP registries.  Some registries have wrong values, some
   registries do not follow current common practice, and some are just
   right.  For the sake of completeness, this document reviews all NTP
   and NTS registries.

   This document updates RFC 5905, RFC 5906, RFC 8573, RFC 7822, and RFC
   7821.

1.  Introduction

   The Network Time Protocol (NTP) and Network Time Security (NTS)
   documents define a number of assigned number registries, collectively
   called the NTP registries.  Some registries have wrong values, some
   registries do not follow current common practice, and some are just
   right.  For the sake of completeness, this document reviews all NTP
   and NTS registries.

   The bulk of this document can be divided into two parts:

   *  First, each registry, its defining document, and a summary of its
      syntax is defined.

   *  Second, the revised format and entries for each registry that is
      being modified is specified.

2.  Existing Registries

   This section describes the registries and the rules for them.  It is
   intended to be a short summary of the syntax and registration
   requirements for each registry.  The semantics and protocol
   processing rules for each registry -- that is, how an implementation
   acts when sending or receiving any of the fields -- is not described
   here.

2.1.  Reference ID, Kiss-o'-Death

   [RFC5905] defined two registries; the Reference ID in Section 7.3,
   and the Kiss-o'-Death in Section 7.4.  Both of these are allowed to
   be four ASCII characters; padded on the right with all-bits-zero if
   necessary.  Entries that start with 0x58, the ASCII letter uppercase
   X, are reserved for Private or Experimental Use. Both registries are
   first-come first-served.  The formal request to define the registries
   is in Section 16.

   [RFC5905], Section 7.5 defined the on-the-wire format of extension
   fields but did not create a registry for it.

2.2.  Extension Field Types

   [RFC5906] mentioned the Extension Field Types registry, and defined
   it indirectly by defining 30 extensions (15 each for request and
   response) in Section 13.  It did not provide a formal definition of
   the columns in the registry.  [RFC5906], Section 10 splits the Field
   Type into four subfields, only for use within the Autokey extensions.

   [RFC7821] added a new entry, Checksum Complement, to the Extension
   Field Types registry.

   [RFC7822] clarified the processing rules for Extension Field Types,
   particularly around the interaction with the Message Authentication
   Code (MAC) field.

   [RFC8573] changed the cryptography used in the MAC field.

   The following problems exists with the current registry:

   *  Many of the entries in the Extension Field Types registry have
      swapped some of the nibbles; 0x1234 is listed as 0x1432 for
      example.  This document marks the erroneous values as reserved.

   *  Some values were mistakenly re-used.

2.3.  Network Time Security Registries

   [RFC8915] defines the NTS protocol.  Its registries are listed here
   for completeness, but no changes to them are specified in this
   document.

   Sections 7.1 through 7.5 (inclusive) added entries to existing
   registries.

   Section 7.6 created a new registry, NTS Key Establishment Record
   Types, that partitions the assigned numbers into three different
   registration policies: IETF Review, Specification Required, and
   Private or Experimental Use.

   Section 7.7 created a new registry, NTS Next Protocols, that
   similarly partitions the assigned numbers.

   Section 7.8 created two new registries, NTS Error Codes and NTS
   Warning Codes.  Both registries are also partitioned the same way.

3.  Updated Registries

   The following general guidelines apply to all registries updated
   here:

   *  Every entry reserves a partition for Private or Experimentatal
      Use.

   *  Registries with ASCII fields are now limited to uppercase letters;
      fields starting with 0x2D, the ASCII minus sign, are reserved for
      Private or Experimental Use..

   *  The policy for every registry is now Specification Required, as
      defined in [RFC8126], Section 4.6.

   The IESG is requested to choose three designated experts, with two
   being required to approve a registry change.

   Each entry described in the below sub-sections is intended to
   completely replace the existing entry with the same name.

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  NTP Reference Identifier Codes

   The registration procedure is changed to Specification Required.

   The Note is changed to read as follows:

   *  Codes beginning with the character "-" are reserved for
      experimentation and development.  IANA cannot assign them.

   The columns are defined as follows:

   *  ID (required): a four-byte value padded on the right with zero's.
      Each value must be an ASCII uppercase letter or minus sign

   *  Clock source (required): A brief text description of the ID

   *  Reference (required): the publication defining the ID.

   The existing entries are left unchanged.

4.2.  NTP Kiss-o'-Death Codes

   The registration procedure is changed to Specification Required.

   The Note is changed to read as follows:

   *  Codes beginning with the character "-" are reserved for
      experimentation and development.  IANA cannot assign them.

   The columns are defined as follows:

   *  ID (required): a four-byte value padded on the right with zero's.
      Each value must be an ASCII uppercase letter or minus sign.

   *  Meaning source (required): A brief text description of the ID.

   *  Reference (required): the publication defining the ID.

   The existing entries are left unchanged.

4.3.  NTP Extension Field Types

   The registration procedure is changed to Specification Required.

   The reference should be [RFC5906] added, if possible.

Internet-Draft         Updating the NTP Registries          October 2021


   The following Note is added:

   *  Field Types in the range 0xF000 through 0xFFFF, inclusive, are
      reserved for experimentation and development.  IANA cannot assign
      them.  Both NTS Cookie and Autokey Message Request have the same
      Field Type; in practice this is not a problem as the field
      semantics will be determined by other parts of the message.

   The columns are defined as follows:

   *  Field Type (required): A two-byte value in hexadecimal.

   *  Meaning (required): A brief text description of the field type.

   *  Reference (required): the publication defining the field type.

   The table is replaced with the following entries.
