Internet-Draft            The 'tdl:' URI Scheme             January 2002


1. Overview

   The 'tdl:' URI scheme is intended to provide a simple but consistent
   means by which a data literal (lexical form) can be paired with a
   datatype URI allowing one to denote the unique data value represented
   by that pairing.

   The 'tdl:' URI scheme belongs to the class of URIs known as Uniform
   Resource Values (URV) which are themselves a subclass of Uniform
   Resource Primitives (URP), a class of URI which constitutes a
   "WYSIWYG" URI, one which is not dereferencible to and does not denote
   another web resource, but constitutes a self-contained resource where
   the full realization of that resource is expressed in the URI itself.
   For a full discussion of the properties of URPs and URVs, please see
   [4].  Familiarity with the concepts defined therein will facilitate
   the full understanding of this document.

   Examples:

      tdl:(http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer)15
      tdl:(http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#lang)fi
      tdl:(http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#NMTOKENS)foo%20bar%20bas
      tdl:(http://dodo.xyz.net/x-token)foo
      tdl:(voc://john.doe@widgets.org/xycoord)28.191
      tdl:(uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6)392f291a093

   These examples are provided for illustrative purposes only and do not
   necessarily constitute actual URIs.  See the BNF definition below for
   an explicit definition of 'tdl:' URI syntax.

   'tdl:' URIs are particularly useful for applications such as RDF [5]
   where one may wish to make statements about such value resources.
   E.g.

      <rdf:Description rdf:about="tdl:(http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#lang)fi">
         <rdfs:label>Finnish</rdfs:label>
      </rdf:Description>

   There is the additional benefit that if canonical lexical forms are
   used, every data value represented by a 'tdl:' URI in an RDF graph
   will share a common graph node, which both provides a considerable
   amount of graph compression compared to other literal datatyping
   schemes as well as facilitates queries or inference based on typed
   data values.

2. BNF for the 'tdl:' URI Scheme

   This is a BNF-like description of the 'tdl:' Uniform Resource

   Identifier syntax, using the conventions of RFC 822[2], except that
   "|" is used to designate alternatives, and brackets [] are used
   around optional or repeated elements.  Briefly, literals are quoted
   with "", optional elements are enclosed in [brackets], and elements
   may be preceded with <n>* to designate n or more repetitions of the
   following element; n defaults to 0.

   This BNF description adopts sub-definitions defined in RFC 2396
   "Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax" [1] which are
   not repeated here.


   tdl-URI       = "tdl:" "(" type ")" value
   type          = absoluteURI [ "#" fragment ]
   value         = 1*uric

   absoluteURI   = <as defined by RFC 2396>
   fragment      = <as defined by RFC 2396>
   uric          = <as defined by RFC 2396>

   Note that the URI scheme prefix "tdl:" is considered to be a valid
   URI denoting this URI scheme, though it is not itself a valid URI
   according to this URI scheme.
