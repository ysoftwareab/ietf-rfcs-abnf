                   DTLS Encapsulation of SCTP Packets
                draft-ietf-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-encaps-04.txt

Abstract

   The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is a transport
   protocol originally defined to run on top of the network protocols
   IPv4 or IPv6.  This document specifies how SCTP can be used on top of
   the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol.  Using
   encapsulation method described in this document, SCTP is agnostic
   about the protocols being used below DTLS, explicit IP addresses can
   not be used in the SCTP control chunks.  As a consequence, the SCTP
   associations are single homed.

1.  Overview

   The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) as defined in
   [RFC4960] is a transport protocol running on top of the network
   protocols IPv4 [RFC0791] or IPv6 [RFC2460].  This document specifies
   how SCTP is used on top of the Datagram Transport Layer Security
   (DTLS) protocol defined in [RFC6347].  This encapsulation is used for
   example within the WebRTC protocol suite (see
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-overview] for an overview) for transporting
   non-(S)RTP data between browsers.  The architecture of this stack is
   described in [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel].

   Please note that the procedures defined in [RFC6951] for dealing with
   the UDP port numbers do not apply here.  When using the encapsulation
   defined in this document, SCTP is agnostic about the protocols used
   below DTLS.

2.  Conventions

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft               SCTP over DTLS                     May 2014


3.  Encapsulation and Decapsulation Procedure

   When an SCTP packet is provided to the DTLS layer, the complete SCTP
   packet, consisting of the SCTP common header and a number of SCTP
   chunks, MUST be handled as the payload of the application layer
   protocol of DTLS.  When the DTLS layer has processed a DTLS record
   containing a message of the application layer protocol, the payload
   MUST be given up to the SCTP layer.  The SCTP layer expects an SCTP
   common header followed by a number of SCTP chunks.

4.  General Considerations

   An implementation of SCTP over DTLS MUST implement and use a path
   maximum transmission unit (MTU) discovery method that functions
   without ICMP to provide SCTP/DTLS with an MTU estimate.  An
   implementation of "Packetization Layer Path MTU Discovery" [RFC4821]
   either in SCTP or DTLS is RECOMMENDED.

5.  DTLS Considerations

   The DTLS implementation MUST be based on DTLS 1.2 [RFC6347].  The
   support of future versions of DTLS is RECOMMENDED if defined.

   If path MTU discovery is performed by the DTLS layer, the method
   described in [RFC4821] MUST be used.  For probe packets, the
   extension defined in [RFC6520] MUST be used.

   If path MTU discovery is performed by the SCTP layer and IPv4 is used
   as the network layer protocol, the DTLS implementation MUST allow the
   DTLS user to enforce that the corresponding IPv4 packet is sent with
   the Don't Fragment (DF) bit set.  If controlling the DF bit is not
   possible, for example due to implementation restrictions, a safe
   value for the path MTU has to be used by the SCTP stack.

   The DTLS implementation SHOULD allow the DTLS user to set the
   Differentiated services code point (DSCP) used for IP packets being
   sent.  This requires the DTLS implementation to pass the value
   through and the lower layer to allow setting this value.  If the
   lower layer does not support setting the DSCP, then the DTLS user
   will end up with the default value used by protocol stack.  Please
   note that only a single DSCP value can be used for all packets
   belonging to the same SCTP association.

   Using explicit congestion notifications (ECN) in SCTP requires the
   DTLS layer to pass the ECN bits through and its lower layer to expose
   access to them for sent and received packets.  If this is not
   possible, for example due to implementation restrictions, ECN can't
   be used by SCTP.

   SCTP performs segmentation and reassembly based on the path MTU.
   Therefore the DTLS layer MUST NOT use any compression algorithm.

   The DTLS MUST support sending messages larger than the current path
   MTU.  This might result in sending IP level fragmented messages.

6.  SCTP Considerations

   This section describes the usage of the base protocol and the
   applicability of various SCTP extensions.

6.1.  Base Protocol

   This document uses SCTP [RFC4960] with the following restrictions,
   which are required to reflect that the lower layer is DTLS instead of
   IPv4 and IPv6 and that SCTP doesn't deal with the IP addresses or the
   transport protocol used below DTLS:

   o  A DTLS connection MUST be established before an SCTP association
      can be set up.

   o  All SCTP associations are single-homed.  Therefore it is
      RECOMMENDED to set the SCTP parameter path.max.retrans to
      association.max.retrans.

   o  The INIT and INIT-ACK chunk MUST NOT contain any IPv4 Address or
      IPv6 Address parameters.  The INIT chunk MUST NOT contain the
      Supported Address Types parameter.

   o  The implementation MUST NOT rely on processing ICMP or ICMPv6
      packets.  This applies in particular to path MTU discovery when
      performed by SCTP.

6.2.  Padding Extension

   The padding extension defined in [RFC4820] MUST be supported and used
   for probe packets when performing path MTU discovery as specified in
   [RFC4821].

6.3.  Dynamic Address Reconfiguration Extension

   If the dynamic address reconfiguration extension defined in [RFC5061]
   is used, only wildcard addresses MUST be used in ASCONF chunks.

6.4.  SCTP Authentication Extension

   The SCTP authentication extension defined in [RFC4895] can be used
   with DTLS encapsulation, but does not provide any additional benefit.

6.5.  Partial Reliability Extension

   Partial reliability as defined in [RFC3758] can be used in
   combination with DTLS encapsulation.  It is also possible to use
   additional PR-SCTP policies.

6.6.  Stream Reset Extension

   The SCTP stream reset extension defined in [RFC6525] can be used with
   DTLS encapsulation.  It is used to reset SCTP streams and add SCTP
   streams during the lifetime of the SCTP association.

6.7.  Interleaving of Large User Messages

   SCTP as defined in [RFC4960] does not support the interleaving of
   large user messages that need to be fragmented and reassembled by the
   SCTP layer.  The protocol extension defined in
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-sctp-ndata] overcomes this limitation and can be used
   with DTLS encapsulation.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires no actions from IANA.

8.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations for DTLS are specified in [RFC6347] and for
   SCTP in [RFC4960], [RFC3758], and [RFC6525].  The combination of SCTP
   and DTLS introduces no new security considerations.

   It should be noted that the inability to process ICMP or ICMPv6
   messages does not add any security issue.  The processing of these
   messages for SCTP carried over a connection-less lower layer like IP,
   IPv6 or UDP is required to protect nodes not supporting SCTP.  Since
   DTLS provides a connection-oriented lower layer, this kind of
   protection is not necessary.
