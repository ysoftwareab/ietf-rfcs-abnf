           Single Area Border RBridge Nickname for Multilevel
           draft-ietf-trill-multilevel-single-nickname-06.txt

Abstract

   A major issue in multilevel TRILL is how to manage RBridge nicknames.
   In this document, the area border RBridge uses a single nickname in
   both Level 1 and Level 2. RBridges in Level 2 must obtain unique
   nicknames but RBridges in different Level 1 areas may have the same
   nicknames.

1. Introduction

   TRILL multilevel techniques are designed to improve TRILL scalability
   issues. As described in [RFC8243], there have been two proposed
   approaches. One approach, which is referred as the "unique nickname"
   approach, gives unique nicknames to all the TRILL switches in the
   multilevel campus, either by having the Level-1/Level-2 border TRILL
   switches advertise which nicknames are not available for assignment
   in the area, or by partitioning the 16-bit nickname into an "area"
   field and a "nickname inside the area" field.  The other approach,
   which is referred as the "aggregated nickname" approach, involves
   assigning nicknames to the areas, and allowing nicknames to be reused

   in different areas, by having the border TRILL switches rewrite the
   nickname fields when entering or leaving an area.

   The approach specified in this document is different from both
   "unique nickname" and "aggregated nickname" approach. In this
   document, the nickname of an area border RBridge is used in both
   Level 1 (L1) and Level 2 (L2). No additional nicknames are assigned
   to the L1 areas. Each L1 area is denoted by the group of all
   nicknames of those border RBridges of the area. For this approach,
   nicknames in L2 MUST be unique but nicknames inside different L1
   areas MAY be reused. The use of the approach specified in this
   document in one L1 area does not prohibit the use of other approaches
   in other L1 areas in the same TRILL campus.

   border learning border RBridge nicknames.

          Figure 1: An Example Topology for TRILL Multilevel

   In Figure 1, RB2, RB20, RB3 and RB30 are area border TRILL switches
   (RBridges). Their nicknames are 2, 20, 3 and 30 respectively. Area
   border RBridges use the set of border nicknames to denote the L1 area
   that they are attached to. For example, RB2 and RB20 use nicknames
   {2,20} to denote the L1 area on the left.

   A source S is attached to RB27 and a destination D is attached to

   RB44. RB27 has a nickname, say 27, and RB44 has a nickname, say 44
   (and in fact, they could even have the same nickname, since the TRILL
   switch nickname will not be visible outside these Level 1 areas).

3.1. Actions on Unicast Packets

   Let's say that S transmits a frame to destination D and let's say
   that D's location is learned by the relevant TRILL switches already.
   These relevant switches have learned the following:

   1) RB27 has learned that D is connected to nickname 3.
   2) RB3 has learned that D is attached to nickname 44.

   The following sequence of events will occur:

   -  S transmits an Ethernet frame with source MAC = S and destination
      MAC = D.

   -  RB27 encapsulates with a TRILL header with ingress RBridge = 27,
      and egress RBridge = 3 producing a TRILL Data packet.

   -  RB2 and RB20 have announced in the Level 1 IS-IS instance in area
      {2,20}, that they are attached to all those area nicknames,
      including {3,30}. Therefore, IS-IS routes the packet to RB2 (or
      RB20, if RB20 on the least-cost route from RB27 to RB3).

   -  RB2, when transitioning the packet from Level 1 to Level 2,
      replaces the ingress TRILL switch nickname with its own nickname,
      so replaces 27 with 2. Within Level 2, the ingress RBridge field
      in the TRILL header will therefore be 2, and the egress RBridge
      field will be 3. (The egress nickname MAY be replaced with an area
      nickname selected from {3,30}. See Section 4 for the detail of the
      selection method. Here, suppose nickname 3 is used.) Also RB2
      learns that S is attached to nickname 27 in area {2,20} to
      accommodate return traffic. RB2 SHOULD synchronize with RB20 using
      ESADI protocol [RFC7357] that MAC = S is attached to nickname 27.

   -  The packet is forwarded through Level 2, to RB3, which has
      advertised, in Level 2, its L2 nickname as 3.

   -  RB3, when forwarding into area {3,30}, replaces the egress
      nickname in the TRILL header with RB44's nickname (44). (The
      ingress nickname MAY be replaced with an area nickname selected
      from {2,20}. See Section 4 for the detail of the selection method.
      Here, suppose nickname 2 is selected.) So, within the destination
      area, the ingress nickname will be 2 and the egress nickname will
      be 44.

INTERNET-DRAFT      Single Nickname Multiple Levels        July 19, 2018


   -  RB44, when decapsulating, learns that S is attached to nickname 2,
      which is one of the area nicknames of the ingress.

3.2. Actions on Multi-Destination Packets

   Distribution trees for flooding of multi-destination packets are
   calculated separately within each L1 area and in L2. When a multi-
   destination packet arrives at the border, it needs to be transitioned
   either from L1 to L2, or from L2 to L1. All border RBridges are
   eligible for Level transition. However, for each multi-destination
   packet, only one of them acts as the Designated Border RBridge (DBRB)
   to do the transition while other non-DBRBs MUST drop the received
   copies. All border RBridges of an area SHOULD agree on a pseudorandom
   algorithm and locally determine the DBRB as they do in the "Per-flow
   Load Balancing" section. It's also possible to implement a certain
   election protocol to elect the DBRB. However, such kind of
   implementations are out the scope of this document.

   As per [RFC6325], multi-destination packets can be classified into
   three types: unicast packet with unknown destination MAC address
   (unknown-unicast packet), multicast packet and broadcast packet. Now
   suppose that D's location has not been learned by RB27 or the frame
   received by RB27 is recognized as broadcast or multicast. What will
   happen, as it would in TRILL today, is that RB27 will forward the
   packet as multi-destination, setting its M bit to 1 and choosing an
   L1 tree, flooding the packet on the distribution tree, subject to
   possible pruning. 

   When the copies of the multi-destination packet arrive at area border
   RBridges, non-DBRBs MUST drop the packet while the DBRB, say RB2,
   needs to do the Level transition for the multi-destination packet.
   For a unknown-unicast packet, if the DBRB has learnt the destination
   MAC address, it SHOULD convert the packet to unicast and set its M
   bit to 0. Otherwise, the multi-destination packet will continue to be
   flooded as multicast packet on the distribution tree. The DBRB
   chooses the new distribution tree by replacing the egress nickname
   with the new root RBridge nickname. The following sequence of events
   will occur:

   -  RB2, when transitioning the packet from Level 1 to Level 2,
      replaces the ingress TRILL switch nickname with its own nickname,
      so replaces 27 with 2. RB2 also needs to replace the egress
      RBridge nickname with the L2 tree root RBridge nickname, say 2. In
      order to accommodate return traffic, RB2 records that S is
      attached to nickname 27 and SHOULD use ESADI protocol to
      synchronize this attachment information with other border RBridges
      (say RB20) in the area.

   -  RB20, will receive the packet flooded on the L2 tree by RB2. It is
      important that RB20 does not transition this packet back to L1 as
      it does for a multicast packet normally received from another
      remote L1 area. RB20 should examine the ingress nickname of this
      packet. If this nickname is found to be a border RBridge nickname
      of the area {2,20}, RB2 must not forwarded the packet into this
      area.

   -  The packet is flooded on the Level 2 tree to reach both RB3 and
      RB30. Suppose RB3 is the selected DBRB. The non-DBRB RB30 will
      drop the packet.

   -  RB3, when forwarding into area {3,30}, replaces the egress
      nickname in the TRILL header with the root RBridge nickname, say
      3, of the distribution tree of L1 area {3,30}. (Here, the ingress
      nickname MAY be replaced with an area nickname selected from
      {2,20} as specified in Section 4.) Now suppose that RB27 has
      learned the location of D (attached to nickname 3), but RB3 does
      not know where D is. In that case, RB3 must turn the packet into a
      multi-destination packet and floods it on the distribution tree of
      L1 area {3,30}. 

   -  RB30, will receive the packet flooded on the L1 tree by RB3. It is
      important that RB30 does not transition this packet back to L2.
      RB30 should also examine the ingress nickname of this packet. If
      this nickname is found to be an L2 border RBridge nickname, RB30
      must not transition the packet back to L2.

   -  The multicast listener RB44, when decapsulating the received
      packet, learns that S is attached to nickname 2, which is one of
      the area nicknames of the ingress.

4. Per-flow Load Balancing

   Area border RBridges perform ingress/egress nickname replacement when
   they transition TRILL data packets between Level 1 and Level 2. This
   nickname replacement enables the per-flow load balance which is
   specified as follows. 

4.1. Ingress Nickname Replacement

   When a TRILL data packet from other areas arrives at an area border
   RBridge, this RBridge MAY select one area nickname of the ingress to
   replace the ingress nickname of the packet. The selection is simply
   based on a pseudorandom algorithm as defined in Section 5.3 of
   [RFC7357]. With the random ingress nickname replacement, the border
   RBridge actually achieves a per-flow load balance for returning
   traffic.

INTERNET-DRAFT      Single Nickname Multiple Levels        July 19, 2018


   All area border RBridges in an L1 area MUST agree on the same
   pseudorandom algorithm. The source MAC address, ingress area
   nicknames, egress area nicknames and the Data Label of the received
   TRILL data packet are candidate factors of the input of this
   pseudorandom algorithm. Note that the value of the destination MAC
   address SHOULD be excluded from the input of this pseudorandom
   algorithm, otherwise the egress RBridge will see one source MAC
   address flip flopping among multiple ingress RBridges.

4.2. Egress Nickname Replacement

   When a TRILL data packet originated from the area arrives at an area
   border RBridge, this RBridge MAY select one area nickname of the
   egress to replace the egress nickname of the packet. By default, it
   SHOULD choose the egress area border RBridge with the least cost
   route to reach. The pseudorandom algorithm as defined in Section 5.3
   of [RFC7357] may be used as well. In that case, however, the ingress
   area border RBridge may take the non-least-cost Level 2 route to
   forward the TRILL data packet to the egress area border RBridge.

5. Protocol Extensions for Discovery

5.1. Discovery of Border RBridges in L1

   The following Level 1 Border RBridge APPsub-TLV will be included in
   an E-L1FS FS-LSP fragment zero [RFC7780] as an APPsub-TLV of the
   TRILL GENINFO-TLV. Through listening to this Appsub-TLV, an area
   border RBridge discovers all other area border RBridges in this area.

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Type = L1-BORDER-RBRIDGE      | (2 bytes)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Length                        | (2 bytes)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   o  Length: 2

   o  Sender Nickname: The nickname the originating IS will use as the
      L1 Border RBridge nickname. This field is useful because the
      originating IS might own multiple nicknames.

5.2. Discovery of Border RBridge Sets in L2

   The following APPsub-TLV will be included in an E-L2FS FS-LSP

   fragment zero [RFC7780] as an APPsub-TLV of the TRILL GENINFO-TLV.
   Through listening to this APPsub-TLV in L2, an area border RBridge
   discovers all groups of L1 border RBridges and each such group
   identifies an area.

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Type = L1-BORDER-RB-GROUP     | (2 bytes)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Length                        | (2 bytes)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | L1 Border RBridge Nickname 1  | (2 bytes)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | ...                           |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | L1 Border RBridge Nickname k  | (2 bytes)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   o  Type: Level 1 Border RBridge Group (TRILL APPsub-TLV type tbd2)

   o  Length: 2 * k. If length is not a multiple of 2, the APPsub-TLV is
      corrupt and MUST be ignored.

   o  L1 Border RBridge Nickname: The nickname that an area border
      RBridge uses as the L1 Border RBridge nickname. The L1-BORDER-RB-
      GROUP TLV generated by an area border RBridge MUST include all L1
      Border RBridge nicknames of the area. It's RECOMMENDED that these
      k nicknames are ordered in ascending order according to the 2-
      octet nickname considered as an unsigned integer.

   When an L1 area is partitioned [RFC8243], border RBridges will re-
   discover each other in both L1 and L2 through exchanging LSPs. In L2,
   the set of border RBridge nicknames for this splitting area will
   change. Border RBridges that detect such a change MUST flush the
   reach-ability information associated to any RBridge nickname from
   this changing set.

6. One Border RBridge Connects Multiple Areas

   It's possible that one border RBridge (say RB1) connects multiple L1
   areas. RB1 SHOULD use a single area nickname for all these areas. 

   Nicknames used within one of these areas can be reused within other
   areas. It's important that packets destined to those duplicated
   nicknames are sent to the right area. Since these areas are connected
   to form a layer 2 network, duplicated {MAC, Data Label} across these
   areas ought not occur. Now suppose a TRILL data packet arrives at the
   area border nickname of RB1. For a unicast packet, RB1 can lookup the
   {MAC, Data Label} entry in its MAC table to identify the right

   destination area (i.e., the outgoing interface) and the egress
   RBridge's nickname. For a multicast packet: suppose RB1 is not the
   DBRB, RB1 will not transition the packet; otherwise, RB1 is the DBRB,

   -  if this packet is originated from an area out of the connected
      areas, RB1 should replicate this packet and flood it on the proper
      Level 1 trees of all the areas in which it acts as the DBRB.

   -  if the packet is originated from one of the connected areas, RB1
      should replicate the packet it receives from the Level 1 tree and
      flood it on other proper Level 1 trees of all the areas in which
      it acts as the DBRB except the originating area (i.e., the area
      connected to the incoming interface). RB1 may also receive the
      replication of the packet from the Level 2 tree. This replication
      must be dropped by RB1.

7. E-L1FS/E-L2FS Backwards Compatibility

   All Level 2 RBridges MUST support E-L2FS [RFC7356] [RFC7780]. The
   Extended TLVs defined in Section 5 are to be used in Extended Level
   1/2 Flooding Scope (E-L1FS/E-L2FS) PDUs. Area border RBridges MUST
   support both E-L1FS and E-L2FS. RBridges that do not support either
   E-L1FS or E-L2FS cannot serve as area border RBridges but they can
   well appear in an L1 area acting as non-area-border RBridges.

8. Security Considerations

   For general TRILL Security Considerations, see [RFC6325].

   The newly defined TRILL APPsub-TLVs in Section 5 are transported in
   IS-IS PDUs whose authenticity can be enforced using regular IS-IS
   security mechanism [IS-IS] [RFC5310]. This document raises no new
   security issues for IS-IS.

   Using aggregated nicknames, and the resulting possible duplication of
   nicknames between areas, increases the possibility of a TRILL Data
   packet being delivered to the wrong egress RBridge if areas are
   suddenly merged. However, in many cases the data would be discarded
   at that egress because it would not match a known end station data
   label/MAC address.

9. IANA Considerations

9.1. TRILL APPsub-TLVs

   IANA is requested to allocate two new types under the TRILL GENINFO

Appendix A. Clarifications

A.1. Level Transition

   It's possible that an L1 RBridge is only reachable from a non-DBRB
   RBridge. If this non-DBRB RBridge refrains from Level transition, the
   question is, how can a multicast packet reach this L1 RBridge? The
   answer is, it will be reached after the DBRB performs the Level
   transition and floods the packet using an L1 distribution tree. 

   Take the following figure as an example. RB77 is reachable from the
   border RBridge RB30 while RB3 is the DBRB. RB3 transitions the
   multicast packet into L1 and floods the packet on the distribution
   tree rooted from RB3. This packet will finally flooded to RB77 via
   RB30.

                    Area{3,30}
                  +--------------+          (root) RB3 o
                  |              |                      \
             -RB3 |              |                       o RB30
               |  |              |                      /
             -RB30-RB77          |                RB77 o
                  +--------------+

                  Example Topology               L1 Tree

   In the above example, the multicast packet is forwarded along a non-
   optimal path. A possible improvement is to have RB3 configured not to
   belong to this area. In this way, RB30 will surely act as the DBRB to
   do the Level transition.
