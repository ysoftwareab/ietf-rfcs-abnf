1.  Introduction

   This document defines an RR type to implement an architecture similar
   to the Digital Object Architecture [ITU-X.1255] within the DNS.  Each
   DOA RR contains an object type that might be opaque and private to
   the producer and the consumer of the data and either the data (if
   small enough to fit in the RR) or a pointer on how to retrieve the
   actual data.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  The DOA Resource Record

3.1.  Description

   The Type value for the DOA RR is TBD.  The DOA RR is class
   independent.  No special processing is required within DNS servers or
   libraries.

Internet-Draft                DOA over DNS                  October 2017


   The RDATA of the resource record comprises of five fields: DOA-
   ENTERPRISE, DOA-TYPE, DOA-MEDIA-TYPE, DOA-LOCATION and DOA-DATA.

3.1.1.  Enterprise and Type fields

   The DOA-ENTERPRISE and DOA-TYPE fields are combined to indicate the
   semantic type of the DOA record being represented by the RR.  That
   semantic is private to the producer of data hosted on an
   authoritative DNS server and the application software using a DNS
   stub resolver to retrieve it.

   The DOA-ENTERPRISE field uses values as specified in the IANA SMI
   Network Management Private Enterprise Codes Registry
   [IANA-ENTERPRISE].  An exception to that is that the reserved value
   of zero (0) is used to indicate that the the DOA-ENTERPRISE is not
   set.

   Some commonly used values of DOA-TYPE are registered in the IANA DOA
   Type Registry Section 7.1, others are privately defined.  As those
   private types might be used in cross-organization systems, use of the
   DOA-ENTERPRISE field is RECOMMENDED to disambiguate types.

3.1.2.  Location field

   The DOA-LOCATION signals how the DOA-DATA field should be interpreted
   using the values specified in the DOA Location Type Registry
   Section 7.2.

   The value 0 is reserved.

   For the value 1 ("Local"), the DOA-DATA contains the actual DOA
   object.

   For the value 2 ("URI") the DOA-DATA contains a UTF-8 encoded string
   representing the URI from which the DOA object can be obtained.

   For the value 3 ("HDL") the DOA-DATA contains a UTF-8 encoded string
   representing the handle from the Handle System [RFC3650]  from which
   the DOA object can be obtained.

   Other values might be defined in the future, for example for NFS,
   LDAP, etc...

   DNS software implementing the DOA RR type MUST NOT drop or otherwise
   refuse to handle the DOA RRs containing an unknown or unsupported
   DOA-location and MUST treat the DOA-DATA portion of the RR as an
   abstract opaque field.

3.1.3.  Media Type

   The DOA-MEDIA-TYPE field contains the Internet media type [RFC6838]
   for the DOA object represented by this record.

   If a non-Local object is retrieved over a protocol that supports
   inclusion of a media type value (e.g. an HTTP Content-Type header)
   then the client MUST use that value (if supplied) in preference to
   any value specified inside this resource record.  In such case, the
   DOA-MEDIA-TYPE MAY be set to NULL, length 0.

3.1.4.  Data

   The DOA-DATA field contains either the object's data, or some form of
   reference specifying from where the data can be obtained, per the
   DOA-LOCATION field above.

   DOA-ENTERPRISE: a 32-bit unsigned integer in network order.

   DOA-TYPE: a 32-bit unsigned integer in network order.

   DOA-LOCATION: an 8-bit unsigned integer.

   DOA-MEDIA-TYPE: A <character-string> (see [RFC1035]).  The first
   octet of the <character-string> contains the number of characters to
   follow.

Internet-Draft                DOA over DNS                  October 2017


   DOA-DATA: A variable length blob of binary data.  The length of the
   DOA-DATA is not contained within the wire format of the RR and has to
   be computed from the RDLENGTH of the entire RR once other fields have
   been taken into account.

3.3.  DOA RDATA Presentation Format

   The DOA-ENTERPRISE field is presented as an unsigned 32-bit decimal
   integer with range 0 - 4,294,967,295.

   The DOA-TYPE field is presented as an unsigned 32-bit decimal integer
   with range 0 - 4,294,967,295.

   The DOA-LOCATION field is presented as an unsigned 8-bit decimal
   integer with range 0 - 255.

   The DOA-MEDIA-TYPE field is presented as a single <character-string>.

   The DOA-DATA is presented as Base64 encoded data [RFC4648] unless the
   DOA-DATA is empty in which case it is presented as a single dash
   character ("-", ASCII 45).  White space is permitted within Base64
   data.

4.  Security Considerations

   The use of DNSSEC is encouraged to protect the integrity of the data
   contained in the DOA RR type.

5.  Privacy Considerations

   Personally identifiable information (PII) data appearing in the DOA-
   DATA field SHOULD be encrypted.

6.  Operational consideration

   Some DOA records might contain large data that is only of interest to
   a single party, as such, caching those records does not provide much
   benefits and could be considered a denial of service attack on the
   caching resolver infrastructure.  It is thus RECOMMENDED that the TTL
   associated with large DOA RRs be set as small as possible to avoid
   caching.

7.  IANA Considerations
