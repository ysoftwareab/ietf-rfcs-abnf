Abstract

   This document adds two event action types to the IANA RDAP JSON

1.  Introduction

   Generic TLDs (gTLDs) Domain Name Registries and Registrars operating
   according to an agreement with the Internet Corporation for Assigned
   Names and Numbers (ICANN), which includes a clause to implement a
   successor protocol to WHOIS [RFC3912], are required to deploy the
   Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) described in RFCs 7480-7484.
   Registries and registrars are required to provide at least the same
   fields as in the Whois service.

   Registrars operating according to the ICANN Registrar Accreditation
   Agreement 2013 (see [RAA2013] are required to provide the "Registrar
   Registration Expiration Date" that shows the expiration date of the
   domain name within the registrar system.  There is no event action
   defined in the RDAP base RFCs that could be used to map this field.

   Registries and registrars regularly use a database (i.e.  RDDS
   database) synchronized from the Shared Registry System (SRS) database
   to provide the Registration Data Directory Services (e.g.  WHOIS and
   RDAP).  Registries operating according to an ICANN Base Registry
   Agreement (see [Base_RA]), Registrars operating under the ICANN
   Registrar Accreditation Agreement 2013 (see [RAA2013], and Registries
   operating according to other ICANN Registry Agreements are required
   to provide the date and time that the object instance in the RDDS
   database was last synchronized from the SRS database.  There is no
   event action defined in the RDAP base RFCs that could be used to map
   this field.

   This document adds two event action types to the IANA RDAP JSON
   Values registry, defined in [RFC7483], which are required to map two
   fields from the gTLD Whois output into the RDAP response.

2.  Event Actions registration

   The following values have been registered in the IANA RDAP JSON
   Values registry:

   Value:  last update of RDAP database
   Type:  event action
   Description:  An action noting when the information in the object
      instance in the RDAP database was last synchronized from the
      authoritative database (e.g. registry database).
   Registrant Name:  ICANN
   Registrant Contact Information:  tech-services@icann.org

   Value:  registrar expiration
   Type:  event action
   Description:  An action noting the expiration date of the object in
      the registrar system.
   Registrant Name:  ICANN
   Registrant Contact Information:  tech-services@icann.org

3.  Acknowledgements

   TBD.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document adds two event action types to the IANA RDAP JSON
   Values registry, the description of the event types can be found in
   Section 2.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document adds two event action types to the IANA RDAP JSON
   Values registry.  No additional security considerations are required.
