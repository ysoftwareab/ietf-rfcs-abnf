Abstract

   Nowadays access to the Internet is a part of daily life.  Users see
   URIs written in various ways on various media, recognize them as "the
   Internet Addresses", and use them to access to the Internet.  Many
   application programs recognize URIs automatically and make links to
   them, so the users can access to the URIs very easily.  But, at this
   moment, most of application programs can't recognize
   Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) and Internationalized URI (IRI)
   correctly, so users will feel stress when using IDNs and IRIs.

   Utilization of the IDNs and the IRIs are getting higher.  Therefore,
   improvement of the application programs are highly recommended.  This
   document is intended to be an application developpers' guideline for
   recognizing and corresponding to IDNs/IRIs correctly.

Internet-Draft               IRI recognition                    Feb 2007


1.  Introduction

   Since most of major Web browsers are compliant to Internationalized
   Domain Name (IDN) [RFC3490] and Internationalized URI (IRI)
   [RFC3987], utilization of the IDNs and the IRIs are getting higher.
   However, IDN/IRI aware application programs (hereinafter,
   applications) other than Web browsers are very few.

   From users' point of view, applications recognizing IRIs in context
   and taking appropriate action as well as performed for URIs are
   prefered.  For example, copy-and-paste the IRI from an application to
   another application, click the IRI to invoke external application,
   and so on.  In principle, there is no difference between recognizing
   URI and IRI.  But, in reality, many applications can't recognize IRIs
   although can recognize URIs.

   General method for delimiting a URI in context is already defined in
   the Appendix C.  of [RFC3986].  To apply the method to IRIs in
   applications, this document tries to clarify ambiguous point and
   relations between caller and callee applications.


2.  Delimiting an IRI in Context

   In Appendix C.  of [RFC3986], main points to delimit a URI are as
   follows:

   1.  Wrap URI with double-quotes, e.g.
       "http://www.example.com/"
   2.  Wrap URI with angle brackets, e.g.
       <http://www.example.com/>
   3.  Delimit by using whitespace, e.g.
       http://www.example.com/

   The first two points are clear.  When applications find a URI scheme
   name with preceding double-quote or left angle bracket, then
   applications search for corresponding double-quote or right angle
   bracket and recognize the string within double-quotes or angle
   brackets is a URI.  Note that the double-quotes and the angle
   brackets are not part of a URI.  This method is also valid for an
   IRI.

   The last point is ambiguous to two things.  The first one is the
   definition of whitespace itself.  In applications, characters marked
   as White_Space in [PropList] defined by [Unicode] should be
   recognized as whitespace.  The seconde one is whether a URI have to
   be wrapped by whitespaces.  The beginning of a URI scheme name is
   unambiguous, therefore, prepending whitespace is not necessary.  When

   applications find a URI scheme name without preceding double-quote or
   left angle bracket, then applications search for whitespace and
   recognize the string terminated by whitespace is a URI.  Note that
   the whitespaces are not part of a URI.  This method is also valid for
   an IRI.


3.  Passing an IRI between applications

   IDNs and IRIs have its ASCII compatible encoding (hereinafter, ACE)
   form according to its specification.  For example, IDNs have Punycode
   form, and IRIs have %-encoding form.  Generally, when passing an IRI
   as a protocol parameter between applications, it should be in ACE
   form.  But, there is a big difference between applications being able
   to recognize IRIs and being able to convert IRIs to ACE form.  At the
   User Interface level, passing an IRIs in IRI form is more convenient.
   For example, when copying the IRI which is recognized automatically
   by an application and pasting to another application, it should be in
   IRI form.

   When an application passes an IRI to another application by users'
   action such as link click, there might be some combinations.
   Following is a matrix which describes combinations conceptually.

                                  +-------------------------+
                                  |         Callee          |
       +--------------------------+-------------------------+
       |                          |         IDN/IRI         |
       | Caller            +------+-----------+-------------+
       |                   | Form | compliant | uncompliant |
       +-----+-------------+------+-----------+-------------+
       |     | recognize   | IRI  |    OK     |     NG      |
       | IDN +-------------+------+-----------+-------------+
       |  /  |             | IRI  |    OK     |     NG      |
       | IRI | compliant   +------+-----------+-------------+
       |     |             | ACE  |    OK     |     OK      |
       +-----+-------------+------+-----------+-------------+

                   passing form and access availability

   For example, if caller application recognize IDN/IRI correctly
   according to this document but does not compliant to IDN/IRI
   standards, then it passes IRI to another (callee) application.  The
   callee application can access to the passed IRI if it is IDN/IRI
   compliant, otherwise not.

   Caller application does not know whether callee applications are IDN/
   IRI compliant.  But it can be assumed under certain circumstances.

   In general, the most probable callee application is the Web browser.
   As described in Section 1, most of major Web browsers on PCs are IDN/
   IRI compliant, so passing an IRI in IRI form is assumed to work.
   Right now, there is no comprehensive list of circumstances, therefore
   the assumption is an open issue.


4.  Security Considerations

   Without verifying IRI string well, it is dangerous to access
   automatically recognized IRI.  See the security considerations in
   [RFC3490] and [RFC3986] for further information.


5.  IANA Considerations

   No IANA actions are required by this document.
