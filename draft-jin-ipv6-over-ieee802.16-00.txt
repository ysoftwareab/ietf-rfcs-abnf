  1. Introduction 
      
     This document specifies the transmission of IPv6 packet over 802.16 
     networks. The specification includes the MTU size of IPv6 packets, 
     the frame format for transmission of IPv6 packets, the method of 
     forming IPv6 link-local addresses and statelessly autoconfigured 
     addresses on IEEE802.16 networks. It also specifies the content of 
     the Source/Target Link-layer Address option used in Router 
     Solicitation, Router Advertisement, Neighbor Solicitation, Neighbor 
     Advertisement and Redirect messages when those messages are 
     transmitted on an IEEE802.16 network. 
      
     IEEE802.16 standard is to provide reliable, broadband, fast wireless 
     connectivity in anywhere. IEEE802.16d specifies fixed broadband 
     wireless access and IEEE802.16e specifies an amendment of PHY/MAC 
     access control layer to support mobile connection. Specially, 
     802.16e support Mobile Subscriber Station (MSS) moving at vehicular 
     speeds and thereby specifies a fixed and mobile broadband wireless 
     access, anytime and anywhere. This document is applicable to both 
     IEEE802.16d and IEEE802.16e networks.

  2. Terminology 
      
     This document borrows all of the terminology from RFC2464 [IPv6oE], 
     with the following additional terms from the IEEE802.16 
     specification [WirelessMAN]. 
      
       SS    Subscriber Station. A generalized equipment set providing 
             connectivity between subscriber equipment and a base station 
             (BS) 
        
       MSS   Mobile Subscriber Station. A subscriber station that 
             supports communications while in motion. 
        
       BS    Base Station. A Generalized equipment set providing 
             connectivity, management, and control of the subscriber 
             station (SS) 
        
       PDU   Protocol Data Unit. The data unit exchanged between peer 
             entities of the same protocol layer. On the downward 
             direction, it is the data unit generated for the next lower 
             layer. On the upward direction, it is the data unit received 
             from the previous lower layer. 
        
       SDU   Service Data unit. The data unit exchanged between two 
             adjacent protocol layers. On the downward direction, it is 
             the data unit received from the previous higher layer. On 
             the upward direction, it is the data unit sent to the next 
             higher layer. 
        
       PHSI  Payload Header Suppression Index. An 8 bits mask that 
             indicates which bytes in the Payload Header Suppression 
             Field (PHSF) to suppress and which bytes to not suppress. 
      
      
  3. Maximum Transmission Unit 
      
     The default MTU size for IPv6 [IPV6] packets on an IEEE802.16 is 
     2041 octets because the size of IEEE802.6 MAC PDU is represented by 
     11 bits in bytes and the MAC PDU includes 6 bytes Generic MAC Header, 
     optional Payload and optional CRC. This size may be reduced by a 
     Router Advertisement [DISC] containing an MTU option which specifies 
     a smaller MTU, or by manual configuration of each node. If a Router 
     Advertisement received on an Ethernet interface has an MTU option 
     specifying an MTU larger than 2041, or larger than a manually 
     configured value, that MTU option may be logged to system management 
     but must be otherwise ignored. For purposes of this document, 
     information received from DHCP is considered "manually configured".

  4. Frame Format 
      
     IPv6 packets are transmitted in standard IEEE802.16 MAC PDUs. The 
     MAC PDU includes Generic MAC Header, optional Payload and optional 
     CRC. The Payload contains the IPv6 header followed immediately by 
     the IPv6 payload, and possibly padding octets to meet the minimum 
     frame size for the IEEE802.16 MAC PDU. 
      
      
     MSB                                                            LSB

  5. Stateless Autoconfiguration 
      
     The Interface Identifier [AARCH] for a IEEE802.16 interface is based 
     on the EUI-64 identifier [EUI64] derived from the interface's built-
     in 48-bit IEEE802 universal MAC address. This address uniquely 
     defines the SS from within the set of all possible vendors and 
     equipment types. It is used during the initial ranging process to 
     establish the appropriate connections for an SS. It is also used as 
     part of the authentication process by which the BS and SS each 
     verify the identity of the other. 
      
     The Interface Identifier is then formed from the EUI-64 by 
     complementing the "Universal/Local" (U/L) bit, which is the next-to-
     lowest order bit of the first octet of the EUI-64. Complementing 
     this bit will generally change a 0 value to a 1, since an 
     interface's built-in address is expected to be from a universally 
     administered address space and hence have a globally unique value.  
     A universally administered IEEE 802 address or an EUI-64 is 
     signified by a 0 in the U/L bit position, while a globally unique 
     IPv6 Interface Identifier is signified by a 1 in the corresponding 
     position.  For further discussion on this point, see [AARCH]. 
      
     A different MAC address set manually or by software should not be 
     used to derive the Interface Identifier. If such a MAC address must 
     be used, its global uniqueness property should be reflected in the 
     value of the U/L bit. 
      
     An IPv6 address prefix used for stateless autoconfiguration [ACONF] 
     of an Ethernet interface must have a length of 64 bits. 
      
      
  6. Link-Local Addresses 
      
     The IPv6 link-local address [AARCH] for a IEEE802.16 interface is 
     formed by appending the Interface Identifier, as defined above, to 
     the prefix FE80::/64.

  7. Address Mapping -- Unicast 
      
     The procedure for mapping IPv6 unicast addresses into 802.16 link-
     layer addresses is described in [DISC]. The Source/Target Link-layer 
     Address option has the following form when the link layer is 
     IEEE802.16. 
      
      
                       0                   1

                      +-         802.16 MAC          -+   
                      |                               |   
                      +-           Address           -+   
                      |                               |   
                      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  
      
     Option fields: 
      
        Type    1 for Source Link-layer address. 
                2 for Target Link-layer address. 
      
        Length  1 (in units of 8 octets). 
      
        802.16 MAC Address 
      
                The 48-bit IEEE802 address, in canonical bit order. This 
                is the address the interface currently responds to, and 
                may be different from the built-in address used to derive 
                the Interface Identifier. 
      
  8. Address Mapping -- Multicast 
      
     An IPv6 packet with a multicast destination address DST, consisting 
     of the sixteen octets DST[1] through DST[16], is transmitted to the 
     Ethernet multicast address whose first two octets are the value 3333 
     hexadecimal and whose last four octets are the last four octets of 
     DST.

  9. Security Considerations 
      
     The method of derivation of Interface Identifiers from MAC addresses 
     is intended to preserve global uniqueness when possible. However, 
     there is no protection from duplication through accident or forgery.
