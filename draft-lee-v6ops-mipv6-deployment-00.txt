1.  Introduction

   Recently, Broadband Wireless Access (BWA) is emerging as an
   alternative solution for wireless Metropolitan Area Network (MAN).
   IEEE 802.16 WG specifies a new air interface and medium access
   control (MAC) protocol and provides high data rate as well as large
   cell coverage.  In addition, it provides seamless mobility so that
   mobile users can use wireless Internet services while they are on the
   vehicles, which move fast.  In this environment, Mobile IPv6[2] is a
   proper solution to provide session continuity.

   In this document, we focus Mobile IPv6 deployment scenarios for
   broadband wireless access network.  With the respect of internet
   service providers (ISPs), we describe requirements and considerations
   for deploying Mobile IPv6.  It helps for enterprise administrators to
   refine their deployment scenarios and to make plans to deploy
   wireless access service based on Mobile IPv6.  We also consider
   Hierachical Mobile IPv6  [3] and Network Mobilty Basic Support [4]
   specifications for performance optimization and their integration
   scenarios.

2.  Terminology

   Terms used in this draft are defined in [2], [3] and [4].

3.  Overview of Mobile IPv6 Deployment over Broadband Wireless Access
    Service

   When an ISP deploys Mobile IPv6 over Broadband Wireless Access
   networks, it should consider followings :

      Low handoff delay to support real-time applications: Fast handover
      [5], Fast handover for 802.11 [6], Hierarchical Mobile IPv6

      Reducing signaling overhead at core networks: Hierarchical Mobile
      IPv6, Network Mobility

      Integration with prior hotspot services: Vertical Handover

   With the respect of network management, following questions are
   arising :

   How many Base Stations (BSs) can be placed in an AR?

      One to one correspondence, one to many correspondence, many to
      many correspondences

   How can Home Agents (HAs) be located?

      Centralized or distribute manner

   How can MNs are allocated IP address?

      Static allocation, dynamic allocation at HA, dynamic allocation at
      Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server

   How can MNs are authenticated?

      Authenticated by Diameter, authenticated by Radius, authenticated
      by the HA

       Figure 1. Handover Cases.


   In BWA deployment scenario, handover is classified into three cases.

   Intra-AR L2 handover (case A in Figure 1)

      Intra-AR L2 handover occurs when an MN moves into a new BS area
      within a AR area.  In this case, its CoA is not changed, so that
      no IP layer-signaling messages are required.  As soon as MN
      attaches to new AP, it can communicate immediately with CN.

Internet-Draft          MIPv6 deployment for BWA               July 2005


   Intra-AR L3 handover (case B in Figure 1)

      Intra-AR L3 handover occurs when an MN moves into a new BS area
      and change the subnet but doesn't change the serving AR.  Even
      though its AR doesn't change, the MN should configure new CoA and
      should register it with its HA

   Inter-AR L3 handover (case C in Figure 1)

      Inter-AR L3 handover occurs when an MN moves into a new BS area
      and the BS attaches to a new AR.  In this case, the MN should
      configure new CoA and register it with its HA

   Generally speaking, since L3 handover delay is much longer than L2
   handover delay, If possible L3 handover should be surpressed.  So
   from a handover point of view It is better that the number of AR is
   small and each AR manages a lot of BSs.  But if the number of AR is
   too small, load of each AR becomes higher.  So When decide the number
   of AR, ISP should consider the tradeoff between handover delay and
   load of each AR.

5.  Hierarchical MIPv6 Deployment Considerations

   An MN should send binding update messages whenever it changes its
   subnet.  Since binding update messages travel through core Internet
   to reach the HA, inter AR handover delay may be long and it can be
   burden of core Internet.  To resolve this problem, Hierarchical
   Mobile IPv6 was proposed.  In the Hierarchical Mobile IPv6, a new
   agent called mobility anchor point (MAP) is introduced.  If an MN
   moves in the same MAP domain, it sends Binding Update to the local
   MAP rather than the HA.  In other words, the MAP manages movements of
   the MN locally.  Consequently, Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 can reduce
   inter AR handover delay and also reduce the burden of core Internet.

   As metioned in the previous section, the number of AR can be small.
   In this case, deploying Hierarchical Mobile IPv6  just result in
   adding packet delay.  But in terms of fast handover Hierarchical
   Mobile IPv6 would be effective.  In [5], every  AR should receive
   Binding Update message and hold binding caches for the mobile nodes.
   And ARs should be fully conneted to setup efficient bi-directional
   tunnel.  But if Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 is deployed, MAP can be
   local anchor point to support fast handover and can simplify the
   function of ARs.  For further details refer to appendix section of
   the document [3]

   When deploying Hierarchical Mobile IPv6, ISP should consider
   followings :

              Figure 2. MAP locates above AR.


      In this case, a MAP domain covers a lot of ARs.  This deployment
      scenario is economically efficient but MAP can be bottleneck point
      because MAP should encapsulate every incoming and outgoing packet.
      Also, if a failure occurs at the MAP, every MN served by the MAP
      will suffer from service disruptions.

              Figure 3. MAP co-locates with AR.


      In this case, a MAP domain covers only one AR.  The MAP can reduce
      handoff time when intra AR L3 handover occurs.  At the same time,
      the MAP is distributed over the network, so that the MAP load is
      lower than the previous case.  However, this scenarios is not
      useful when inter AR handover occurs frequently.


6.  NEMO Deployment Scenarios

   Network Mobility (NEMO) basic support proposes a solution for mobile
   networks.  In the solution, a mobile router (MR) manages mobile
   network and sends binding update on the behalf of visiting mobile
   nodes and local fixed nodes.  When NEMO basic support is deployed in
   Mobile IPv6 environment, signaling traffic can be reduced and it is
   very attractive to ISP administrators.

   NEMO deployment scenarios are divided into following cases based on
   the types of MR's ingress/egress interfaces.

6.1  egress interface: IEEE 802.16, ingress interface: IEEE 802.11

   This case is appropriate for initial deployment of BWA network.  At
   initial deployment phase, the number of mobile devices with a 802.16
   interface may be small, while mobile devices with a 802.11 interface
   are common.  Therefore, a service model for the 802.16 egress
   interface and 802.11 ingress interface is   required.  The BS and MR
   can be included in the same administrative domain or not.  In the
   latter case, the negotiation such as authentication and billing
   should be done between two domains.

   IEEE 802.15 specifies a standard for short coverage and a low data
   rate wireless Personal Area Network (PAN).  In a private car, there
   can be many devices connected to intenet such as car audio system and
   air conditioning system.  In general, a private car can be covered in
   a small communication range of IEEE 802.15 standards.  So this
   scenario can be useful to serve private car without interference of
   IEEE 802.11 or IEEE 802.16 radio frequency.

7.  NEMO and HMIPv6 Integration Scenarios

   When NEMO and HMIPv6 are deployed together, a deployment model is
   divided into two cases, depending on whether the MN knows the
   existence of MAP or not

7.1  MN knows MAP's existence

   This scenario is specified in [7] for Route Optimization purpose.  In
   this case, an MR forwards an MAP's prefix which is received from its
   egress interface to its ingress interface.  If an MR enters a new MAP
   domain, MNs in the mobile network as well as the MR recognizes that
   MAP's prefix has changed.  Then, the MR and MNs send binding update
   messages to their HAs and register new RCoAs.  But if the MR enters a
   new AR in the same MAP domain, MNs in the mobile network can't
   recognize that AR has changes so only the MR send new LCoA to MAP.

   Strong point

      An MN in a mobile network configures its RCoA based on the MAP's
      prefix which is contained in RA and registers it with its HA, so
      that packets destined to or originated from the MN don't need to
      visit  the MR's HA.  In other words, bi-directional tunnel is
      established between the MN's HA and MAP and considerable level of
      route optimization can be achieved.

   Weak point

      If the MR enters new MAP domain, both the MR and MNs under the MR
      send binding update messages to their HAs.  Therefore, collisions
      may occur at the ingress interface of the MR and it result in high
      signaling overhead.


7.2  MN doesn't know MAP's existence

   In this case an MR doesn't forward prefix of MAP to MNs in the mobile
   network.  When an MR receive a RA message from the AR, the MR creates
   an RCoA  by using a MAP prefix in the RA's MAP option field.  But the
   MR doesn't forward prefix of the MAP to its ingress interface.  As a
   result, an MN doesn't recognize the MR's movement when the MR moves
   from one MAP domain to another MAP domain.  Accordingly, while an MN
   is in the mobile network, the movement of the MN is transparent to
   the HA of the MN and the MAP.

Internet-Draft          MIPv6 deployment for BWA               July 2005


   Strong point

      When an MN is in a mobile network, the MN doesn't have to send a
      binding update message when the MR moves to a new AR or to a new
      MAP domain.  In this case, the handoff delay can be decreased and
      the core network load can be reduced even though the MN doesn't
      support Hierachical Mobile IPv6 functionality.  And MAP should
      maintain security association only with MRs and may not take care
      of MNs.

   Weak point

      Packets destined to or originated from the MN should always visit
      the MN's HA, MR's HA and MAP.  Therefore, the end-to-end packet
      delay increase.


8.  BWA Coexistence with IEEE 802.11 Hotspot

   In nomal case, IEEE 802.11 hotspot service doesn't consider IP layer
   mobility.  This is because object of hotspot service is only to
   support connectivity to internet by using wireless medium and  it
   doesn't consider session continuity.  But If we think of NEMO  in BWA
   access, two coexitence of BWA and hotspot scenarios are arising to
   support session continuity.

   Case 1 : When user moves from station to bus, train, or subway

      An mobile user at the station has been using real time streaming
      service via IEEE 802.16 BWA network and the user now get on
      vehicle such as bus, train or subway.  The user wants the session
      to be contiued.

   Case 2 : When user moves from bus, train, or subway to station

      As mentioned in previoius case, an mobile user on the vehicle
      wants a session to be contiued after he or she gets off the
      vehicle.

   To support seamless handover between IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 802.16,
   mobile deivce such as laptop and PDA should be equipped with both
   interface cards and should have proper vertical handover algorithms.
   And network should support intersystem handover.  If each services is
   done by different administrative domain, they shoud negotiate each
   other for authentication and billing.
