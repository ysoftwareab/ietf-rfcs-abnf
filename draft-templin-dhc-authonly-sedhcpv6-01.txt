               Authentication-only Mode for Secure DHCPv6
               draft-templin-dhc-authonly-sedhcpv6-01.txt

Abstract

   Secure DHCPv6 includes mechanisms for encryption and authentication,
   where encryption is currently mandated due to concerns for pervasive
   monitoring in the Internet.  The Secure DHCPv6 specification states
   that the mechanisms are applicable in any environment where physical
   security on the link is not assured and attacks on DHCPv6 are a
   concern.  However, this document presents a reference use case where
   physical and/or link-layer security are already assured.  This
   document therefore proposes an authentication-only application of
   Secure DHCPv6 when there is already sufficent protection against
   pervasive monitoirng.

1.  Introduction

   DHCPv6 [RFC3315] is the stateful autoconfiguration protocol for IPv6
   [RFC2460].  Secure DHCPv6 [I-D.ietf-dhc-sedhcpv6] includes mechanisms
   for encryption and authentication, where encryption is currently
   mandated due to concerns for pervasive monitoring in the Internet.

   The Secure DHCPv6 specification states that the mechanisms are
   applicable in any environment where physical security on the link is
   not assured and attacks on DHCPv6 are a concern.  However, this
   document presents a reference use case where physical and/or link-
   layer security are assured.  This document therefore proposes an
   authentication-only application of Secure DHCPv6 when there is
   already sufficient protection against pervasive monitoirng.

   Encryption avoidance becomes important when information sharing
   between DHCPv6 clients, relays and servers is required and/or when an
   application of an additional layer of encryption would be redundant
   and would result in poor performance.  The document therefore
   proposes an authentication-only mode for specific use cases where
   pervasive monitoring is already mitigated through other means, but a
   means for authenticating the source of the DHCPv6 message is still
   required.

2.  Use Case for Authentication-only Secure DHCPv6

   Figure 1 depicts a reference use case for an authentication-only mode
   for Secure DHCPv6, where the link between the DHCPv6 client and relay
   is protected by link-layer encryption and/or physical security:

   In this reference use case, the link between the client and relay is
   secured against pervasive monitoring through the application of link-
   layer encryption.  (The link itself also may or may not be secured at
   the phsyical layer.)  No information is therefore available in plain
   text over the link that connects the client and relay.  The channel
   between the relay and server (or, between the first-hop relay and
   next-hop relay) is further secured against pervasive monitoring
   through the application of mechanisms such as IPsec and/or physical
   security.

   In the reference use case, therefore, no opportunity for pervasive
   monitoring exists and the application of an additional layer of
   encryption at the DHCPv6 layer would be unnecessary, inefficient and
   would interfere with client/relay/server information sharing.  An
   example where this use case applies is in the AERO protocol
   [I-D.templin-aerolink].

   This document therefore recommends an amendment of the Secure DHCPv6
   specification to permit an authentication-only application of the
   protocol when pervasive monitoring is already mitigated through other
   means.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document introduces no IANA considerations.

4.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations are discussed in the DHCPv6 and Secure DHCPv6
   specifications [RFC3315][I-D.ietf-dhc-sedhcpv6].  This document notes
   that, in addition to proection against pervasive monitoring of DHCPv6
   messages, a means for authenticating the sources of DHCPv6 messages
   may still be necessary in some environments to mitigate insider
   attacks such as spoofing and theft of service.
