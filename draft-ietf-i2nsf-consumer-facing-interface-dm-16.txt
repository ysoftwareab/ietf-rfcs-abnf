            I2NSF Consumer-Facing Interface YANG Data Model
            draft-ietf-i2nsf-consumer-facing-interface-dm-16

Abstract

   This document describes an information model and a YANG data model
   for the Consumer-Facing Interface between an Interface to Network
   Security Functions (I2NSF) User and Security Controller in an I2NSF
   system in a Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) environment.  The
   information model defines various types of managed objects and the
   relationship among them needed to build the interface.  The
   information model is based on the "Event-Condition-Action" (ECA)
   policy model defined by a capability information model for I2NSF, and
   the data model is defined for enabling different users of a given
   I2NSF system to define, manage, and monitor security policies for
   specific flows within an administrative domain.

1.  Introduction

   In a framework of Interface to Network Security Functions (I2NSF)
   [RFC8329], each vendor can register their NSFs using a Developer's
   Management System (DMS).  Assuming that vendors also provide the
   front-end web applications registered with an I2NSF User, the
   Consumer-Facing Interface is required because the web applications
   developed by each vendor need to have a standard interface specifying
   the data types used when the I2NSF User and Security Controller
   communicate using this interface.  Therefore, this document specifies
   the required information, their data types, and encoding schemes so
   that high-level security policies (or configuration information for
   security policies) can be transferred to the Security Controller
   through the Consumer-Facing Interface.  These policies can easily be
   translated by the Security Controller into low-level security
   policies.  The Security Controller delivers the translated policies
   to Network Security Functions (NSFs) according to their respective
   security capabilities for the required securiy enforcement.

   The Consumer-Facing Interface would be built using a set of objects,
   with each object capturing a unique set of information from Security
   Administrator (i.e., I2NSF User [RFC8329]) needed to express a
   Security Policy.  An object may have relationship with various other
   objects to express a complete set of requirements.  An information
   model captures the managed objects and relationship among these
   objects.  The information model proposed in this document is
   structured in accordance with the "Event-Condition-Action" (ECA)
   policy model.

   An NSF Capability model is proposed in [I-D.ietf-i2nsf-capability] as
   the basic model for both the NSF-Facing interface and Consumer-Facing
   Interface security policy model of this document.

   [RFC3444] explains differences between an information and data model.
   This document uses the guidelines in [RFC3444] to define both the
   information and data model for Consumer-Facing Interface.  Figure 1
   shows a high-level abstraction of Consumer-Facing Interface.  A data
   model, which represents an implementation of the information model in
   a specific data representation language, is also defined in this
   document.

      Figure 1: Diagram for High-level Abstraction of Consumer-Facing
                                 Interface

   Data models are defined at a lower level of abstraction and provide
   many details.  They provide details about the implementation of a
   protocol's specification, e.g., rules that explain how to map managed
   objects onto lower-level protocol constructs.  Since conceptual
   models can be implemented in different ways, multiple data models can
   be derived from a single information model.

   The efficient and flexible provisioning of network functions by a
   Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) system leads to a rapid
   advance in the network industry.  As practical applications, Network
   Security Functions (NSFs), such as firewall, Intrusion Detection
   System (IDS)/Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), and attack
   mitigation, can also be provided as Virtual Network Functions (VNF)
   in the NFV system.  By the efficient virtualization technology, these
   VNFs might be automatically provisioned and dynamically migrated
   based on real-time security requirements.  This document presents a
   YANG data model to implement security functions based on NFV.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document uses the terminology described in [RFC8329].

   This document follows the guidelines of [RFC8407], uses the common
   YANG types defined in [RFC6991], and adopts the Network Management
   Datastore Architecture (NMDA).  The meaning of the symbols in tree
   diagrams is defined in [RFC8340].

3.  Information Model for Policy

   A Policy object represents a mechanism to express a Security Policy
   by Security Administrator (i.e., I2NSF User) using Consumer-Facing
   Interface toward Security Controller; the policy would be enforced on
   an NSF.  Figure 2 shows the YANG tree of the Policy object.  The
   Policy object SHALL have the following information:

   Name:     This field identifies the name of this object.

   Resolution-strategy:  This field represent how to resolve conflicts
             that occur between actions of the same or different policy
             rules that are matched and contained in this particular
             NSF.

   Rules:    This field contains a list of rules.  These rules are
             defined for 1) communication between two Endpoint Groups,
             2) for preventing communication with externally or
             internally identified threats, and 3) for implementing
             business requirement such as controlling access to internal
             or external resources for meeting regulatory compliance or
             business objectives.  An organization may restrict certain
             communication between a set of user and applications for
             example.  The threats may be from threat feeds obtained
             from external sources or dynamically identified by using
             specialty devices in the network.  Rule conflict analysis
             should be triggered by the monitoring service to perform an
             exhaustive detection of anomalies among the configuration
             rules installed into the security functions.

                      Figure 2: Policy YANG Data Tree

   A policy is a list of rules.  In order to express a Rule, a Rule must
   have complete information such as where and when a policy needs to be
   applied.  This is done by defining a set of managed objects and
   relationship among them.  A Policy Rule may be related segmentation,
   threat mitigation or telemetry data collection from an NSF in the
   network, which will be specified as the sub-model of the policy model
   in the subsequent sections.  Figure 3 shows the YANG data tree of the
   Rule object.  The rule object SHALL have the following information:

   Name:     This field identifies the name of this object.

   Priority:  This field identifies the priority of the rule.

   Event:    This field includes the information to determine whether
             the Rule Condition can be evaluated or not.  See details in
             Section 4.1.

   Condition:  This field contains all the checking conditions to apply
             to the objective traffic.  See details in Section 4.2.

   Action:   This field identifies the action taken when a rule is
             matched.  There is always an implicit action to drop
             traffic if no rule is matched for a traffic type.  See
             details in Section 4.3.

   Note that in the case of policy conflicts, the resolution of the
   conflicted policies conforms to the guidelines of "Information Model
   of NSFs Capabilities" [I-D.ietf-i2nsf-capability].

3.1.  Event Sub-model

   The Event Object contains information related to scheduling a Rule.
   The Rule could be activated based on a set time or security event.
   Figure 4 shows the YANG tree of the Event object.  Event object SHALL
   have following information:

   Security-event:  This field identifies for which security event the
             policy is enforced.  The examples of security events are:
             "DDOS", "spyware", "trojan", and "ransomware".

   Time-information:  This represents the security rule is enforced
             based on the period information with the end time for the
             event.

   Start-date-time:  This represents the start date and time of the
             event.  The rule will start repeating from the specified
             start date and time.

   End-date-time:  This represents the end date and time of the event.
             If the rule's time has passed the specified end date and
             time, the rule will stop repeating.

   Period:   This represents the period of time the rule event is
             active.  It can be configured by the start-time, stop-time,
             day, date, and month.

   Frequency:  This represents how frequently the rule should be
             enforced.  There are four options: "only-once", "daily",
             "weekly", "monthly" or "yearly".

3.2.  Condition Sub-model

   This object represents Conditions that Security Administrator wants
   to apply the checking on the traffic in order to determine whether
   the set of actions in the Rule can be executed or not.  The Condition
   Sub-model consists of three different types of containers each
   representing different cases, such as general firewall and DDoS-
   mitigation cases, and a case when the condition is based on the
   payload strings of packets.  Each containers have source and
   destination-target to represent the source and destination for each
   case.  Figure 5 shows the YANG tree of the Condition object.  The
   Condition Sub-model SHALL have following information:

   Case (firewall-condition):  This field represents the general
             firewall case, where a security admin can set up firewall
             conditions using the information present in this field.
             The source and destination is represented as source,
             destination, transport layer protocol, port numbers, and
             ICMP parameters.

   Case (ddos-condition):  This field represents the condition for DDoS
             mitigation, where a security admin can set up DDoS
             mitigation conditions using the information present in this
             field.  The rate of packet, byte, or flow threshold can be
             configured to mitigate the DDoS.

   Case (anti-virus-condition):  This field represents the condition for
             Antivirus, where a security admin can set up Antivirus
             conditions using the information present in this field.
             The file names or types can be configured to be allowed
             without the Antivirus interuption.

Internet-Draft  Consumer-Facing Interface YANG Data Mode    January 2022


   Case (payload-condition):  This field contains the payload string
             information.  This information is useful when security rule
             condition is based on the string contents of incoming or
             outgoing packets.  The name referring to the payload-groups
             defined and registered in the endpoint-groups.

   Case (url-condition):  This field represents the URL to be filtered.
             This information can be used to block or allow a certain
             URL or website.  The url-name is a group of URL or websites
             to be matched.

   Case (voice-condition):  This field contains the call source-id, call
             destination-id, and user-agent.  This information can be
             used to filter a caller id or receiver id to prevent any
             VoIP or VoLTE exploits or attack.

   Case (context-condition):  This field represents a context of a
             packet or flow.  The context can be extended.  This module
             provides a context of geographic location.

   Case (Threat-feed-condition):  This field contains the information
             obtained from threat-feeds (e.g., Palo-Alto, or RSA-

             condition is based on the existing threat reports gathered
             by other sources.

4.  Information Model for Policy Endpoint Groups

   The Policy Endpoint Group is a very important part of building User-
   Construct based policies.  A Security Administrator would create and
   use these objects to represent a logical entity in their business
   environment, where a Security Policy is to be applied.  There are
   multiple managed objects that constitute a Policy's Endpoint Group,
   as shown in Figure 7.  Figure 8 shows the YANG tree of the Endpoint-
   Groups object.  This section lists these objects and relationship
   among them.

   It is assumed that the information of Endpoint Groups (e.g., User-
   group, Device-group, and Location-group) such as the IP address(es)
   of each member in a group are stored in the I2NSF database available
   to the Security Controller, and that the IP address information of
   each group in the I2NSF database is synchronized with other systems
   in the networks under the same administration.

5.  Information Model for Threat Prevention

   The threat prevention plays an important part in the overall security
   posture by reducing the attack surfaces.  This information could come
   from various threat feeds (i.e., sources for obtaining the threat
   information).  There are multiple managed objects that constitute
   this category.  This section lists these objects and relationship
   among them.  Figure 14 shows the YANG tree of a Threat-Prevention
   object.

5.1.  Threat Feed

   This object represents a threat feed which provides the signatures of
   malicious activities.  Figure 15 shows the YANG tree of a Threat-
   feed-list.  The Threat-Feed object SHALL have the following
   information:

   Name:     This field identifies the name of this object.

   Description:  This is the description of the threat feed.  The
             description should have the clear indication of the
             security attack such as attack type (e.g., APT) and file
             types used (e.g., executable malware).

   Signatures:  This field contains the threat signatures of malicious

             programs or activities provided by the threat-feed.  The
             examples of signature types are "YARA", "SURICATA", and
             "SNORT" [YARA][SURICATA][SNORT].

   It is assumed that the I2NSF User obtains the threat signatures
   (i.e., threat content patterns) from a threat-feed server (i.e., feed
   provider), which is a server providing threat signatures.  With the
   obtained threat signatures, the I2NSF User can deliver them to the
   Security Controller.  The retrieval of the threat signatures by the
   I2NSF User is out of scope in this document.

6.  Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) for I2NSF
    Consumer-Facing Interface

   Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) provides a user
   group with an access control with the following features [RFC8341]:

   *  Independent control of action, data, and notification access is
      provided.

   *  A simple and familiar set of datastore permissions is used.

   *  Support for YANG security tagging allows default security modes to
      automatically exclude sensitive data.

   *  Separate default access modes for read, write, and execute
      permissions are provided.

   *  Access control rules are applied to configurable groups of users.

   The data model of the I2NSF Consumer-Facing Interface utilizes the
   NACM's mechanisms to manage the access control on the I2NSF Consumer-
   Facing Interface.  The NACM with the above features can be used to
   set up the access control rules of a user group in the I2NSF
   Consumer-Facing Interface.

   Figure 17 shows part of the NACM module to enable the access control
   of a user group for the I2NSF Consumer-Facing Interface.  To use the
   NACM, a user needs to configure either a NETCONF server [RFC6241] or
   a RESTCONF server [RFC8040] to enable the NACM module.  Then, the
   user can simply use an account of root or admin user for the access
   control for the module of the I2NSF Consumer-Facing Interface (i.e.,
   ietf-i2nsf-cfi-policy).  An XML example to configure the access
   control a user group for the I2NSF Consumer-Facing Interface can be
   seen in Section 9.

7.  YANG Data Model of Consumer-Facing Interface

   The main objective of this document is to provide both an information
   model and the corresponding YANG data model of I2NSF Consumer-Facing
   Interface.  This interface can be used to deliver control and
   management messages between an I2NSF User and Security Controller for
   the I2NSF User's high-level security policies.

   The semantics of the data model must be aligned with the information
   model of the Consumer-Facing Interface.  The transformation of the
   information model is performed so that this YANG data model can
   facilitate the efficient delivery of the control or management
   messages.

   This data model is designed to support the I2NSF framework that can
   be extended according to the security needs.  In other words, the
   model design is independent of the content and meaning of specific
   policies as well as the implementation approach.

   With the YANG data model of I2NSF Consumer-Facing Interface, this
   document suggests use cases for security policy rules such as time-
   based firewall, VoIP/VoLTE security service, and DDoS-attack
   mitigation in Section 8.

7.1.  YANG Module of Consumer-Facing Interface

   This section describes a YANG module of Consumer-Facing Interface.
   This document provides identities in the data model to be used for
   configuration of an NSF.  Each identity is used for a different type
   of configuration.  The details are explained in the description of
   each identity.  This YANG module imports from [RFC6991].  It makes

8.  XML Configuration Examples of High-Level Security Policy Rules

   This section shows XML configuration examples of high-level security
   policy rules that are delivered from the I2NSF User to the Security
   Controller over the Consumer-Facing Interface.  The considered use
   cases are: Database registration, time-based firewall for web
   filtering, VoIP/VoLTE security service, and DDoS-attack mitigation.

      (Endpoint Group)

   If new endpoints are introduced to the network, it is necessary to
   first register their data to the database.  For example, if new
   members are newly introduced in either of three different groups
   (i.e., user-group, device-group, and url-group), each of them should
   be registered with information such as ip-addresses or protocols used
   by devices.

   Figure 19 shows an example XML representation of the registered
   information for the user-group and device-group with IPv4 addresses
   [RFC5737].

8.2.  Scenario 1: Block SNS Access during Business Hours

   The first example scenario is to "block SNS access during office
   hours" using a time-based firewall policy.  In this scenario, all
   users registered as "employees" in the user-group list are unable to
   access Social Networking Services (SNS) during the office hours
   (weekdays).  The XML instance is described below:

   4.  The destination target is "sns-websites". "sns-websites" is the
       key which represents the list containing the information, such as
       URL, about sns-websites.

   5.  The action required is to "drop" any attempt to connect to
       websites related to Social networking.

8.3.  Scenario 2: Block Malicious VoIP/VoLTE Packets Coming to a Company

   The second example scenario is to "block malicious VoIP/VoLTE packets
   coming to a company" using a VoIP policy.  In this scenario, the
   calls comming from from VOIP and/or VOLTE sources with VOLTE IDs that
   are classified as malicious are dropped.  The IP addresses of the
   employees and malicious VOIP IDs should be blocked are stored in the
   database or datastore of the enterprise.  Here and the rest of the
   cases assume that the security administrators or someone responsible
   for the existing and newly generated policies, are not aware of which
   and/or how many NSFs are needed to meet the security requirements.
   Figure 22 represents the XML document generated from YANG discussed
   in previous sections.  Once a high-level seucurity policy is created
   by a security admin, it is delivered by the Consumer-Facing
   Interface, through RESTCONF server, to the security controller.  The
   XML instance is described below:

   2.  The rule name is "Block_malicious_voip_and_volte_packets".

   3.  The Source is "malicious-id".  This can be a single ID or a list
       of IDs, depending on how the ID are stored in the database.  The
       "malicious-id" is the key so that the security admin can read
       every stored malicious VOIP IDs that are named as "malicious-id".

   4.  The destination target is "employees". "employees" is the key
       which represents the list containing information about employees,
       such as IP addresses.

   5.  The action required is "drop" when any incoming packets are from
       "malicious-id".

8.4.  Scenario 3: Mitigate HTTP and HTTPS Flood Attacks on a Company Web
      Server

   The third example scenario is to "Mitigate HTTP and HTTPS flood
   attacks on a company web server" using a DDoS-attack mitigation
   policy.  Here, the time information is not set because the service
   provided by the network should be maintained at all times.  If the
   packets sent by any sources are more than the set threshold, then the
   admin can set the percentage of the packets to be dropped to safely
   maintain the service.  In this scenario, the source is set as "any"
   to block any sources which send abnormal amount of packets.  The
   destination is set as "web_server01".  Once the rule is set and
   delivered and enforced to the nsfs by the securiy controller, the
   NSFs will monitor the incoming packet amounts and the destination to
   act according to the rule set.  The XML instance is described below:

9.  XML Configuration Example of a User Group's Access Control for I2NSF
    Consumer-Facing Interface

   This is an example for creating privileges for a group of users
   (i.e., a user group) to access and use the I2NSF Consumer-Facing
   Interface to create security policies via the interface.  For the
   access control of the Consumer-Facing Interface, the NACM module can
   be used.  Figure 24 shows an XML example the access control of a user
   group (named Example-Group) for I2NSF Consumer-Facing Interface A
   group called Example-Group can be created and configured with NACM
   for the Consumer-Facing Interface.  For Example-Group, a rule list
   can created with the name of Example-Group-Rules.  Example-Group-
   Rules has two rules of Example-Group-Rule1 and Example-Group-Rule2 as
   follows.  For Example-Group-Rule1, the privilege of "Read" is allowed
   to Example-Group for the Consumer-Facing Interface.  On the other
   hand, for Example-Group-Rule2, the privileges of "Create", "Update",
   and "Delete" are denied against Example-Group for the Consumer-Facing
   Interface.

   The access control for the I2NSF Consumer-Facing Interface is as
   follows.

   1.  The NACM is enabled.

   2.  As a group name, Example-Group is specified.

   3.  As members of the group, Alice, Bob, and Eve are specified.

   4.  As a rule list name, Example-Group-Rules is specified for
       managing privileges of Example-Group's members.

   5.  As the first rule name, Example-Group-Rule1 is specified.  This
       rule is used to give read privilege to Example-Group's members
       for the module of the I2NSF Consumer-Facing Interface.

   6.  As the second rule name, Example-Group-Rule2 is specified.  This
       rule is used to deny create, update, and delete privileges
       against Example-Group's members for the module of the I2NSF
       Consumer-Facing Interface.

11.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a data schema
   designed to be accessed through network management protocols such as
   NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer is
   the secure transport layer, and the required secure transport is
   Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS,
   and the required secure transport is TLS [RFC8446].

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides a means of restricting access to specific NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and contents.  Thus, NACM SHOULD be used
   to restrict the NSF registration from unauthorized users.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable, creatable, and deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations to these data nodes
   could have a negative effect on network and security operations.
   These data nodes are collected into a single list node with the
   following sensitivity/vulnerability:

   *  list i2nsf-cfi-policy: Writing to almost any element of this YANG
      module would directly impact on the configuration of NSFs, e.g.,
      completely turning off security monitoring and mitigation
      capabilities; altering the scope of this monitoring and
      mitigation; creating an overwhelming logging volume to overwhelm
      downstream analytics or storage capacity; creating logging
      patterns which are confusing; or rendering useless trained
      statistics or artificial intelligence models.

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and data
   nodes with their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   *  list i2nsf-cfi-policy: The leak of this node to an attacker could
      reveal the specific configuration of security controls to an
      attacker.  An attacker can craft an attack path that avoids
      observation or mitigations; one may reveal topology information to
      inform additional targets or enable lateral movement; one enables
      the construction of an attack path that avoids observation or
      mitigations; one provides an indication that the operator has
      discovered the attack.  This node also holds a list of endpoint
      data that is considered private to the users.
