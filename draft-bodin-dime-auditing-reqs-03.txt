   maintaining hard-state and soft-state during failover and in the
   event of delayed refresh messages respectively.  Often there is a
   need to query for information on active sessions for backup or

1.  Terminology and Conventions

   The key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT,
   RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL in this document are to be interpreted
   as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   Diameter has been widely adopted as a base protocol for different
   interfaces of next generation network (NGN) architectures developed
   by 3GPP, ETSI TISPAN and the ITU-T.  Some of these interfaces are
   used to support hard state as well as to support soft state.  For
   example, in the ETSI TISPAN NGN architecture the service policy
   decision function (SPDF) offers a Diameter based interface facing
   application functions over which they can issue resource reservation
   requests for various media flows.  Such an application function can,
   e.g., be a SIP based soft-switch or a portal for media streaming.
   The interface between the SPDF and applications functions must
   support both hard and soft state.

   This contribution offers three failover use cases, two for hard-state
   and one for soft-state, that would benefit from the addition of an
   auditing function to Diameter.  The primary requirement being set out
   in this draft is the requirement for retrieving state for failover
   and synchornization purposes.

2.1.  Definitions of hard and soft state reservations

   In this draft, hard-state reservations and soft-state reservation
   will be used in the meanings documented by ETSI TISPAN[ETSI06].

   o  Hard-state reservation: type of reservation whereby the requested
      resources are reserved without time limit.  Hard-state
      reservations are terminated if the DIAMETER session is terminated.
   o  Soft-state reservation: type of reservation whereby the requested
      resources are reserved for a finite amount of time.  Soft-state
      reservations are terminated when the DIAMETER session is
      terminated.

2.2.  Replication

   The replication of session data can be performed regularly to
   facilitate instantiation of fresh server platform using replicated
   data.  This approach is herein referred to as replication for warm
   standby.  Another approach is to replicate session data in real-time
   to a parallel server platform, which immediately can take over the
   primary server's tasks in case it fails or becomes unavailable.  This



Bodin, et al.             Expires March 2, 2008                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft     Auditing Functionality in Diameter        August 2007


   approach is referred to as replication for hot standby.  The case
   when no session data is replicated, a fresh server platform taking
   over the primary server's tasks is referred to as a cold standby.

   It should be noted that refresh messages may be desirable not only
   for soft-state reservations.  By having clients refreshing their
   active sessions before a timeout in the server it can be ensured that
   the clients remain in sync with the server.  When a timeout occurs at
   the absence of an expected refresh message the server would, in this
   scenario, keep the session and issue a callback to the client
   informing it that a session exists that has not been refreshed
   accordingly.  The client may then either provide a refresh or
   explicitly terminate the session by replying to this callback.

   The behavior of issuing a callback to the client when a session
   timeout occurs can clearly be useful also for soft-state sessions.
   For example, clients failing in refreshing sessions would with such
   callbacks not need to re-establish sessions that should not have been
   allowed to expire and handle possible consequences of session data
   being wrongly removed.  Refresh failures may for example occur if a
   delayed refresh arrives after a session has already been deleted.
   However, in contrst to when hard-state is maintained, a soft-state
   server needs to eventually terminate a session which is not being
   refreshed in time (e.g. after a short period following a callback).

   Issuing a callback to ask whether a session is still active is
   generally a useful mechanism to assure that clients and their server
   remain syncronized.  That is, a client or a server can benefit from
   the ability to issue such a question triggered by any internal or
   external event to make sure a particular session (or set of sessions)
   is still active in the peer node.  For example, in case refresh
   messages are not used for a hard-state server, the Diameter server
   could issue a callback for sessions that have been active for a
   longer period to make sure they are still active in the corresponding
   client.

2.3.  Diameter used for hard-state reservations

   There are at least two common use cases when Diameter is used for
   hard-state reservations:

   o  without replication
   o  with replication

2.3.1.  In the case of failover without replication

   In cases where hard state is used over a Diameter interface in an
   environment where nodes have backups in case of failure, client nodes



Bodin, et al.             Expires March 2, 2008                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft     Auditing Functionality in Diameter        August 2007


   need a mechanism to audit their server for active sessions.  That is,
   in case a Diameter client node crashes, its backup needs to audit the
   server node for active sessions.  Otherwise the backup node cannot
   know which states are active and can't terminate them when they are
   no longer needed.

   These cases show that an auditing mechanism is needed to support
   hard-state whenever session information is replicated for resilience
   purposes.  It is also clear that the auditing mechanisms needs to be
   symmetrical in order to support both the client auditing for session
   information in the server and the server auditing the client.

2.3.2.  In the case of failover with replication

   A Diameter client, server, or both may replicate session state
   information over several database instances at different nodes to
   facilitate seamless node failovers.  Replication of data over several
   database instances are often done asynchronously to keep response
   times low.  That is, with asynchronous replication (i.e.,
   unacknowledged database writes) a Diameter server can answer
   immediately to a client request instead of waiting for data to be
   properly replicated before answering.  When using hard-state Diameter
   clients and their server face the risk of getting out of sync after a
   failover.

   As a consequence of asynchronous replication, session state requested
   and established in a Diameter server node may not have been properly
   replicated before the server crashes and is seamlessly replaced by
   its backup (e.g., through IP takeover or SCTP multi-homing).  The
   server may, however, have responded to the request before crashing.
   The Diameter client could, therefore, record that lost (hard) session
   state is still active in the server when it is not.  On the other
   hand, in case the client is terminating an active session and the
   server fails in replicating the state removal before crashing the
   backup server node will maintain a hard session state of which the
   client is unaware and which is invalid.

2.4.  Diameter used for soft-state reservations

   In the case of soft-state reservations, an auditing mechanism can
   still be beneficial at failover between servers and between clients.
   At failover between servers the backup server taking over can request
   clients to re-establish their sessions.  Instead waiting for refresh
   messages to arrive is likely to increase the time needed to get in
   sync.  This is particularly true when long timeout periods are used.

   At failover between clients that do not replicate data (i.e., cold
   standby), an auditing mechanism would may allow a backup client to



Bodin, et al.             Expires March 2, 2008                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft     Auditing Functionality in Diameter        August 2007


   re-establish at least part of the original session data.  In case all
   or part of the data possible to obtain from the server is useless to
   the backup client, it can choose to explicitly terminate the
   corresponding sessions.  This would shorten the period at which
   clients and their server are out of sync after a failover.

2.5.  Required Mechanisms

   The cases outlined above require that auditing mechanisms support
   both queries for a list of active sessions and support specific
   queries for detailed session information kept by the queried node
   (i.e., either the client or the server node).

   A further requirement for an auditing mechanism is that it must be
   able to work in parallel with the basic runtime operation of the
   Diameter signaling and interrupt that signaling.  For example, in
   case a large number of audit messages is needed to synchronize, the
   rate of those messages must be possible to limit leaving enough
   capacity to the basic runtime signaling to handle ordinary session
   setup and teardown.

   Support for queries to check if a particular session or a set (list)
   of sessions are still active in the peer node is also required (i.e.
   either the server or a client node).


3.  Diameter Resource Management Extensions

   The contents of this section are based on
   draft-calhoun-diameter-res-mgmt-08.txt [id-res-mgmt] which was
   submitted in March 2001 by Pat R. Calhoun.  The recommendation of the
   authors of this draft is that we use this solution as the starting
   point for meeting the requirements listed above.

3.1.  Extension Overview

   Diameter [RFC3588] is an authentication, authorization and accounting
   (AAA) protocol used for network access services, such as dial-up
   (NASREQ) [RFC4005] and Mobile IP [id-framework] .

   The NASREQ AAA requirements [RFC3169] require that AAA servers
   maintain session state information.  This is typically used to enfore
   a local policy decision, such as limiting the number of simultaneous
   sessions for a specific user, maintaining IP address pools, etc.  The
   AAA WG's network access requirements [RFC2989] require that an AAA
   protocol be able to query for session state information, in the event
   that this information is lost.

   This extension describes an extension to the Diameter protocol that
   allows a Diameter node to query for active session state information
   from its peers in order to rebuild state information.  Although it is
   envisioned that this would be used when state information was lost,
   and needed to be rebuilt, it is possible for a node to periodically
   query for state information in order to ensure that its state is
   current.

   This document only concerns itself with the ability to query for
   session state information.  Resources are actually reserved when a
   user is successfully authorized.  Therefore, relevant application-
   specific extensions, such as [RFC4005] and [id-framework] , MUST
   define what resources are to be managed, by specifying what AVPs MUST
   be present in the Resource-Token AVP.

   The Extension number for this draft is three (3).  Diameter nodes
   conforming to this specification MUST include an Extension-Id AVP
   with a value of three in the Device-Reboot-Ind Command [RFC3588] .

3.1.1.  State synchronization

   When a Diameter node determines that it is has lost all state
   information it had for a specific peer, it SHOULD issue a Session-
   Resource-Query message to the peer.  The node in question MAY
   postpone all authorization messages from the peer until state has
   been restored.

   Upon receipt of the Session-Resource-Query, all Resource-Token AVPs
   for the requested sessions, indicated via one or more Session-Id AVP,
   MUST be returned in a Session-Resource-Reply.  The absence of any
   Session-Id AVP is an indication that all active sessions are to be
   returned.

   If the node is unable to send all of the information within a single
   message, it MUST include the Query-Index AVP, with a value that has
   local significance.  A node that receives a Session-Resource-Reply
   with a Query-Index AVP SHOULD issue another Session-Resource-Query
   message with the Query-Index AVP intact, requesting the rest of the
   state information.

      +----------+    SRQ (no Query-Index AVP)  --->        +----------+
      |          |        <--- SRR (Query-Index AVP = x)    |          |
      | Diameter |    SRQ (Query-Index AVP = x) --->        | Diameter |
      |  Node A  |        <--- SRR (Query-Index AVP = y)    |  Node B  |
      |          |    SRQ (Query-Index AVP = y) --->        |          |
      +----------+        <--- SRR (no Query-Index AVP)     +----------+

                          Session State Exchange

Internet-Draft     Auditing Functionality in Diameter        August 2007


   The above example depicts Diameter Node a issuing an SRQ to Node B.
   Upon replying with an SRR, node B determines that it is unable to
   include all of the Resource-Token AVPs in a single reply, and
   therefore includes the Query-Index AVP with a value of x.

   Upon receipt of the response, node A processes all Resource-Token
   AVPs and issues a subsequent SRQ with the Query-Index AVP set to x.
   Node B receives the SRQ, and using the Query-Index AVP determines
   which sessions need to be included in the corresponding SRR.

   This exchange continues until node B returns an SRR that does not
   include the Query-Index AVP, indicating that there is no further
   session state information to be returned.

3.2.  Command-Code Values

   This section defines Command-Code [RFC3588] values that MUST be
   supported by all Diameter implementations conforming to this
   specification.  The following Command Codes are defined in this
   specification:

        +------------------------+---------+------+---------------+
        | Command Name           | Abbrev. | Code | Reference     |
        +------------------------+---------+------+---------------+
        | Session-Resource-Query | SRQ     | 277  | Section 3.2.1 |
        | Session-Resource-Reply | SRR     | 278  | Section 3.2.2 |
        +------------------------+---------+------+---------------+

3.2.1.  Session-Resource-Query (SRQ)

   The Session-Resource-Query (SRQ), indicated by the Command-Code field
   set to 277, MAY be sent by a Diameter node to any of its peer to
   request a state update.  The presence of one or more Session-Id AVPs
   in the Session-Resource-Query message indicates that the server only
   wants to receive the Resource-Token for the specified session(s).

3.2.2.  Session-Resource-Reply (SRR)

   The Session-Resource-Reply (SRR), indicated by the Command-Code field
   set to 278, is sent in response to a SRQ message.  The SRR message
   contains a Resource-Token for each active session that was requested
   via the Session-Id AVP.  The absence of any Session-Id AVP in the SRQ
   implies that Resource-Tokens for all active sessions MUST be
   returned.

   In the event that all of the state information cannot be sent at
   once, the SRR message MUST include the Query-Index AVP.

      <Session-Resource-Reply>  ::= < Diameter Header: 278 >
                                       { Extension-Id }

3.3.1.  Query-Index AVP

   The Query-Index AVP (AVP Code 500) is of type Unsigned32 and MUST
   only be present in the Session-Resource-Query and the Session-
   Resource-Reply messages.  The Query-Index AVP has local significance
   to the issuer of the Session-Resource-Reply message, and is used to
   identify the state information that remains to be sent in a
   subsequent SRR message.

3.3.2.  Resource-Token AVP

   The Resource-Token AVP (AVP Code 501) is of type Grouped.  The value
   is a set of AVPs used to track state information that is pertinent to
   an active session.  The issuer of the SRR message is responsible for
   creating a Resource-Token AVP for all active sessions requested.

   The following describes the minimum number of AVPs that MUST be
   present in a Resource-Token AVP.  Service-specific AVPs MAY also be
   present, as defined in the appropriate service extension document.

   resource-token = sid host user timestamp extension-id optional
   sid            = Session-Id AVP ; See [RFC3588] , Section 3.1.
   host           = Host-Name AVP ; See [RFC3588] , Section 2.3.1.
   user           = User-Name AVP ; See [RFC3588] , Section 3.3.
   timestamp      = Timestamp AVP ; See [RFC3588] , Section 7.3.
   extension-id   = Extension-Id AVP ; See [RFC3588] , Section 2.6.3.
   optional       = Resource-Bag AVP ; See Section 3.3

   The Host-Name AVP contains the NAI of the access router that is
   servicing the user, while the timestamp AVP contains the time at
   which the successful Diameter authorization response was received,
   and the service was initiated.

3.3.3.   Resource-Bag AVP

   This AVP allows encapsulation of arbitrarily many AVPs to be included
   in a Resource-Token.  These AVPs are defined in service specific
   extensions to Diameter.  The only restrictions to the AVPs is that

   they MUST NOT be interpreted so as to conflict with the other fields
   of the Resource-Token Group value, namely, the Session-Id, Host-Name,
   User-Name, Timestamp or Extension-Id AVPs.

   The Resource-Bag AVP (AVP Code = 502) is of type OctetString.  The
   AVP encapsulates an arbitrary of AVPs, each with its own header and
   value.

3.4.  Original IANA Considerations

   The command codes defined in Section 2.0 are values taken from the
   Command-Code [RFC3588] address space and extended in [RFC4005] ,
   [RFC4004] and [id-acct-ext] .  IANA should record the values as
   defined in Section 3.2

   The AVPs defined in section 3.0 were alllocated from from the AVP
   numbering space defined in [RFC3588] , and extended in [RFC4005] ,
   [RFC4004] and [id-acct-ext] .  IANA should record the values as
   defined in Section 3.3.

3.5.  Original Security Considerations

   This Diameter extension assumes that the Resource Management data is
   secured either through a hop-by-hop authentication mechanism, as
   described in [RFC3588] , or using a strong authentication mechanism
   as defined in [id-crypto-ext].
