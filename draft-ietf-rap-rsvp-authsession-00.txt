Abstract

   This document describes the representation of session authorization
   information in the POLICY_DATA object [POL-EXT] for supporting
   policy-based per-session authorization and admission control in
   RSVP.  The goal of session authorization is to allow the exchange
   of information between network elements in order to authorize the
   use of resources for a service and to co-ordinate actions between
   the signaling and transport planes.  This document describes how a
   process on a system authorizes the reservation of resources by a
   host and then provides that host with a session authorization
   policy element which can be inserted into the RSVP PATH message to
   facilitate proper and secure reservation of those resources within
   the network. We describe the encoding of media authorization
   information as RSVP policy elements and provide details relating to
   operations, processing rules and error scenarios.

2. Introduction

   RSVP [RFC-2205] is a resource reservation setup protocol designed
   for an integrated services [RFC-1633] or DiffEdge [RFC-2998]
   Internet.  The RSVP protocol is used by a host to request specific
   qualities of service from the network for particular application
   data streams or flows.  RSVP is also used by routers to deliver
   quality-of-service (QoS) requests to all nodes along the path(s) of
   the flows and to establish and maintain state to provide the
   requested service.  RSVP requests will generally result in
   resources being reserved in each node along the data path.  RSVP
   allows users to obtain preferential access to network resources,
   under the control of an admission control mechanism.  Such
   admission control is often based on user or application identity
   [I-REP], however, it is also valuable to provide the ability for
   per-session admission control.

   In order to allow for per-session admission control, it is necessary
   to provide a mechanism for ensuring an RSVP request from a host has
   been properly pre-authorized before allowing the reservation of
   resources.  In order to meet this requirement, there must be
   information in the RSVP message which may be used to verify the
   validity of the RSVP request.  This may be done by providing the host
   with a token upon authorization which may be inserted into the RSVP
   PATH message and verified by the network.

   We describe the session authorization element (AUTH_SESSION)
   contained in the POLICY_DATA object.  The user process must obtain an
   AUTH_SESSION object from an authorizing entity, which it may then
   pass to the RSVP process (service) on the originating host.  The RSVP
   service then inserts the AUTH_SESSION object into the RSVP PATH
   message to allow verification of the network resource request.
   Network elements, such as routers, verify the request and then admit
   the RSVP message based on admission policy.

   [S-AUTH] describes a framework in which a session authorization
   policy element may be utilized to contain information relevant to
   the network's decision to grant a reservation request.

3. Policy Element for Session Authorization Data

3.1 Policy Data Object Format

   POLICY_DATA objects contain policy information and are carried by
   RSVP messages. A detail description of the format of POLICY_DATA
   object can be found in "RSVP Extensions for Policy Control" [POL-
   EXT].

3.2 Session Authorization Data Policy Element

   In this section we describe a policy element (PE) called session
   authorization data (AUTH_SESSION).  The AUTH_SESSION policy element
   contains a list of fields which describe the session, along with
   other attributes.

       +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
       | Length                    | P-Type = AUTH_SESSION     |
       +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
       // Session Authorization Attribute List                //
       +-------------------------------------------------------+
   
   Length 
        The length of the policy element (including the Length and
        P-Type) is in number of octets (MUST be in multiples of 4) and
        indicates the end of the session authorization information
        block.

   P-Type (Session Authorization Type)
        The Policy element type (P-type) of this element.  The
        Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) acts as a registry
        for policy element types for identity as described in
        [POL-EXT].  The definition for AUTH_SESSION is currently to be
        defined.

   Session Authorization Attribute List
        The session authorization attribute list is a collection of
        objects which describes the session and provides other
        information necessary to verify the RSVP request.

3.3 Session Authorization Attributes

   A session authorization attribute may contain a variety of
   information and has both an attribute type and subtype.  The
   attribute itself MUST be a multiple of 4 octets in length, and any
   attributes that are not a multiple of 4 octets long MUST be padded
   to a 4-octet boundary.

   | Length          | S-Type |SubType |
   +--------+--------+--------+--------+
   | Value ...
   +--------+--------+--------+--------+


   Length
        The length field is two octets and indicates the actual length
        of the attribute (including Length, S-Type and SubType fields) 
        in number of octets.  The length does NOT include any bytes 
        padding to the value field to make the attribute a multiple of 
        4 octets long.

   S-Type
        Session authorization attribute type (S-Type) field is one
        octet.  IANA SHALL act as a registry for S-Types as described
        in section 7, IANA Considerations.  Initially, the registry
        contains the following S-Types:

            1  AUTH_ENT_ID          The unique identifier of the entity
                                    which authorized the session.

        Considerations. Initially, the registry contains the following
        sub types for DIGITAL_SIGNATURE:

            1  DSA_SHA1      DSA signature using SHA1 [X.509].

            2  RSA_SHA1      RSA signature using SHA1 [X.509].

            3  RSA_MD5       RSA signature using MD5 [X.509].

            4  HMAC_SHA1     HMAC with SHA1 [RFC 2104].

            5  HMAC_MD5      HMAC with MD5 [RFC 2104].        

   OctetString
       OctetString contains the digital signature of the AUTH_SESSION.

4. Framework

   [S-AUTH] describes a framework in which the session authorization
   policy element may be utilized to transport information for use in
   authorizing resource reservation for media flows.

5. Message Processing Rules

5.1 Message Generation (RSVP Host)

   An RSVP message is created as specified in [RFC-2205] with following
   modifications.

   1. RSVP message MUST contain at most one AUTH_SESSION policy element.

Internet Draft       Session Authorization for RSVP        April 2001


   2. A Session Authorization policy element (AUTH_SESSION) is created
      and the IdentityType field is set to indicate the identity type
      in the policy element. Only the required Session Authorization
      attributes are added.
      
   3. POLICY_DATA object (containing the AUTH_SESSION policy element)
      is inserted in the RSVP message in the appropriate place. 

5.2 Message Reception (Router)

   RSVP message is processed as specified in [RFC-2205] with following
   modifications.

   1. If router is policy aware then it SHOULD send the RSVP
      message to the PDP and wait for response. If the router is
      policy unaware then it ignores the policy data objects and
      continues processing the RSVP message.

   2. Reject the message if the response from the PDP is negative.

   3. Continue processing the RSVP message.

5.3 Authorization (Router/PDP)

   1. Retrieve the AUTH_SESSION policy element. Check the PE type
      field and return an error if the identity type is not supported.

   2. Verify the authorizing entity credentials and message integrity.

      - Pre-shared key authentication: Get entity ID, identify
        appropriate pre-shared key for the authorizing entity, and
        validate signature.

      - Public Key: Validate the certificate chain against
        trusted Certificate Authority (CA) and valide the
        message signature using the public key.

      - Kerberos Ticket: Request a ticket for the authorizing entity
        from the local KDC. Use the ticket to access the authorizing 
        entity and obtain authentication data for the message (e.g.
        the signing key) or the data itself.

    3. Verify the requested QoS does not exceed the authorized QoS.

6. Error Signaling

   If PDP fails to verify the AUTH_SESSION policy element then it MUST
   return policy control failure (Error Code = 02) to the PEP. The
   error values are described in [RFC-2205] and [POL-EXT]. Also PDP
   SHOULD supply a policy data object containing an AUTH_DATA
   Policy Element with A-Type=POLICY_ERROR_CODE containing more
   details on the Policy Control failure [I-REP]. The PEP
   will include this Policy Data object in the outgoing RSVP Error
   message.

7. IANA Considerations

   Following the policies outlined in [IANA-CONSIDERATIONS], session
   authorization attribute types (S-Type)in the range 0-127 are
   allocated through an IETF Consensus action, S-Type values between
   128-255 are reserved for Private Use and are not assigned by IANA.

   Following the policies outlined in [IANA-CONSIDERATIONS],
   AUTH_ENT_ID, AUTH_ENT_CRED, SESSION_ID, START_TIME, STOP_TIME,
   SOURCE_IP, DEST_IP, RESOURCES and DIGITAL_SIGNATURE SubType values
   in the range 0-127 are allocated through an IETF Consensus action,
   SubType values between 128-255 are reserved for Private Use and are
   not assigned by IANA.

8. Security Considerations

   The purpose of this draft is to describe a mechanism for media
   authorization to prevent theft of service. It does not cover other
   possible security breaches such as IP spoofing.
