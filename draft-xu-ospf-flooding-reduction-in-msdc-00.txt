                    OSPF Flooding Reduction in MSDC
              draft-xu-ospf-flooding-reduction-in-msdc-00

Abstract

   OSPF is commonly used as a underlay routing protocol for MSDC
   (Massively Scalable Data Center) networks.  This document proposes
   some extensions to OSPF so as to reduce the OSPF flooding within MSDC
   networks greatly.  The reduction of the OSPF flooding is much
   beneficial to improve the scalability of MSDC networks.  These
   modifications are applicable to both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.

1.  Introduction

   OSPF is commonly used as a underlay routing protocol for Massively
   Scalable Data Center (MSDC) networks.  In addition, centrolized
   controllers are becoming fundemental network elements in most MSDCs.
   One or more controllers are usually connected to all routers within
   the MSDC network via a Local Area Network (LAN) which is dedicated
   for network management purpose (called management LAN), as shown in
   Figure 1.

   With the assistance of controllers acting as OSPF DR/BDR for the
   management LAN, OSPF routers within the MSDC network don't need to
   exchange any other type of OSPF packet than the OSPF Hello packet
   among them.  As specified in [RFC2328], these Hello packets are used
   for the purpose of establishing and maintaining neighbor
   relationships and ensuring bidirectional communication between OSPF
   neighbors, and even the Designated Router (DR)/Backup Designated
   Router (BDR) election purpose in the case where those OSPF routers
   are connected to a broadcast network.  In order to obtain the full
   topology information (i.e., the fully synchronized link-state
   database) of the MSDC's network, these OSPF routers would exchange
   the link-state information with the controllers being elected as OSPF
   DR/BDR for the management LAN instead.

   To further suppress the flooding of multicast OSPF packets originated
   from OSPF routers over the management LAN, OSPF routers would not

   send multicast OSPF Hello packets over the management LAN.  Insteads,
   they just wait for OSPF Hello packets originated from the controllers
   being elected as OSPF DR/BDR initially.  Once OSPF DR/BDR for the
   management LAN have been discovered, they start to send OSPF Hello
   packets directly (as unicasts) to OSPF DR/BDR periodically.  In
   addition, OSPF routers would send other types of OSPF packets (e.g.,
   Database Descriptor packet, Link State Request packet, Link State
   Update packet, Link State Acknowledgment packet) to OSPF DR/BDR for
   the management LAN as unicasts as well.  In contrast, the controllers
   being elected as OSPF DR/BDR would send OSPF packets as specified in
   [RFC2328].  As a result, OSPF routers would not receive OSPF packets
   from one another unless these OSPF packets are forwarded as unknown
   unicasts over the management LAN.  Through the above modifications to
   the current OSPF router behaviors, the OSPF flooding is greatly
   reduced which is much beneficial to improve the scalability of MSDC
   networks.  These modifications are applicable to both OSPFv2
   [RFC2328] and OSPFv3 [RFC5340].

   Furthermore, the mechanism for OSPF refresh and flooding reduction in
   stable topologies as described in [RFC2328] could be considered as
   well.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   This memo makes use of the terms defined in [RFC2328].

3.  Modifications to Current OSPF Behaviors

3.1.  OSPF Routers as Non-DRs

   After the exchange of OSPF Hello packets among OSPF routers, the OSPF
   neighbor relationship among them would transitions to and remains in
   the TWO-WAY state.  OSPF routers would originate Router-LSAs and
   Network-LSAs as per [RFC2328].  However, these self-originated LSAs
   need not to be exchanged directly among them anymore.  Instead, these
   LSAs just need to be sent solely to the controllers being elected as
   OSPF DR/BDR for the management LAN.

   To further reduce the flood of multicast OSPF packets over the
   management LAN, OSPF routers SHOULD send OSPF packets as unicasts.
   More specifically, OSPF routers SHOULD send unicast OSPF Hello
   packets periodically to the controllers being elected as OSPF DR/BDR.

   In other words, OSPF routers would not send any OSPF Hello packet
   over the management LAN until they have found OSPF DR/BDR for the
   management LAN.  Note that OSPF routers SHOULD NOT be elected as OSPF
   DR/BDR for the management LAN (This is done by setting the Router
   Priority of those OSPF routers to zero).  As a result, OSPF routers
   would not see each other over the management LAN.  Furthermore, OSPF
   routers SHOULD send all other types of OSPF packets than OSPF Hello
   packets (i.e., Database Descriptor packet, Link State Request packet,
   Link State Update packet, Link State Acknowledgment packet) to the
   controllers being elected as OSPF DR/BDR as unicasts as well.

   To advoid the data traffic from being forwarded across the management
   LAN, the cost of all OSPF routers' interfaces to the management LAN
   SHOULD be set to the maximum value.

3.2.  Controllers as DR/BDR

   The controllers being elected as OSPF DR/BDR would send OSPF packets
   as multicasts or unicasts as per [RFC2328].  In addition, Link State
   Acknowledgment packets are RECOMMENDED to be sent as unicasts if
   possible.
