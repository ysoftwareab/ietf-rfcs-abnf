                         <IMAP HTTP Binding>            January 2005 
 
 
   As part of the LEMONADE goal to define extensions to the IMAPv4 Rev1 
   protocol [RFC3501] for providing optimizations in a variety of 
   settings, this document describes how HTTP can optionally be used to 
   transfer IMAP and SMTP commands and responses. This binding is 
   intended to facilitate the use of IMAP and SMTP in deployments 
   involving a variety of intermediaries, and offers a standardized 
   alternative to de facto proprietary implementations of such a 
   feature.  
    
   The need for an optional HTTP binding is driven by the needs of the 
   mobile network operator community (see [MEMAIL][OMA-ME-RD]), where 
   the reuse of an existing and well-understood technology will allow 
   operators to apply their experience in solving practical deployment 
   issues. Specifically, HTTP allow operators to reuse a similar setup 
   and model that is already used for many other similar and related 
   services, such as certain proprietary push e-mail and synchronization 
   offerings, OMA Data Synchronization, Web services and Web access.  
    
   Using HTTP/HTTPS can simplify deployment in a corporate network 
   through the potential use of a reverse proxy to achieve end-to-end 
   encryption. This also has the advantage of not requiring changes to 
   any firewall configurations and reduces the concerns that this often 
   presents to corporation. In general the solution is compatible with 
   any existing firewall. A reverse proxy can also support deployment 
   models that offer roles to other service providers in the value 
   chains, as discussed in [OMA-ME-AD].  
    
   The confidentiality, integrity, and compression capabilities used 
   with HTTP and already implemented in a wide range of existing mobile 
   device, which be also be reused. 
    
   Studies have also shown that a persistent HTTP session has usually 
   proven more resilient than an IMAP IDLE over TCP connection over an 
   unreliable bearer such as a GPRS-based mobile network. 
 
   The use of HTTP as an underlying protocol for other application 
   protocols has received much attention (see [RFC3205]). In particular, 
   the concern exists that this circumvents firewall security policies. 
   Another concern is the potential misuse or neglect of HTTP semantics 
   by the application protocol that uses HTTP as a substrate. 
    
   Note that if the suppression of IMAP (or indeed any other 
   application) traffic on HTTP/HTTPS is an issue, firewall 
   administrators can still prevent such passage and this can provide 
   incentives to re-configure firewalls to allow solutions on other 
   transports (e.g. TLS) or offer the HTTP-based solution using another 
   provisioned port (e.g. manually, out of band or via instructions like 
   XGETLPREFS (see [NOTIFICATIONS])). The aim, therefore, is to allow 
   for the use of this solution in the widest possible set of

   circumstances by codifying a standard way to do so that works with 
   existing, deployed (i.e., HTTP only) firewalls, while explicitly 
   allowing the possibility of detecting and filtering such traffic in 
   deployments using the HTTP Content-Type in deployments where this is 
   not permitted. 
    
   A SOAP binding is also described. 
    
    
    
2.   Techniques for binding over HTTP 
    
   There are two approaches described below for binding IMAP over HTTP. 
   The first approach shows how to tunnel regular IMAP requests and 
   responses over HTTP using POST. The second method proposes a 
   syntactic change which recodes IMAP requests and responses as SOAP 
   documents, and IMAP commands as SOAP methods.  
    
   <Editor’s note: More approaches and a rationalization of the possible 
   approach will be added later.> 
    
2.1.     Tunneling Approaches 
    
   To use HTTP/HTTPS as the transfer protocol for IMAP commands and 
   responses between the IMAP client and server, the client MUST send an 
   HTTP POST request to the server, and embed IMAP commands (commands to 
   an IMAPv4 Rev1 server or IMAP servers supporting Lemonade extensions) 
   in the body of the request. A server MUST reject a HTTP GET request 
   from the client.  The content-type header of the POST request MUST be 
   set to "application/vnd.lemonade".  Multiple IMAP commands may be 
   included in one POST request. In general, the HTTP server is expected 
   to preserve session state between HTTP commands to the best of its 
   ability, therefore the client does not need to reauthenticate and 
   reissue a SELECT until it receives an (IMAP) error response showing 
   that it is not authenticated. 
    
   In what follows, the term Lemonade client/server is used to refer to 
   a client/server that supports both IMAPv4 Rev1 as well as any 
   LEMONADE extensions. 
    
   When the HTTP binding is used, the Lemonade server listens on 
   whatever port has been configured for this. 
    
   The following is an example of a possible Lemonade HTTP request: 
    
      POST /lemonadePath HTTP/1.1 <CRLF> 
      Content-Type: application/vnd.lemonade <CRLF> 
      [other headers] 
      <CRLF>

      <tag> SP <Lemonade command> <CRLF> 
      [<tag> SP <Lemonade command> <CRLF>] 
    
   The Lemonade command MUST be plain text (7bit). 
    
   Multiple Lemonade commands MAY be sent on the same request. Thus 
   Lemonade commands must be tagged. The client must be able to deal 
   with recovering from errors when commands are batched. See RFC2442 
   Batch SMTP for a further discussion.  
    
   The Content-Type header is the only HTTP headers that MUST  be sent 
   to a Lemonade server. Other headers such as Cache-Control MAY be 
   included.  
    
   When the Lemonade server sends back a response it MUST be in the 
   following format: 
      HTTP/1.1 <HTTP Status Code> <CRLF>   
      Content-Type: text/plain <CRLF> 
      <CRLF> 
      [<untagged responses>] 
      <tag> SP <Lemonade Server response> <CRLF> 
      [[<untagged responses>] 
      <tag> SP <Lemonade Server response> <CRLF>] 
    
   Notes: 
   The Lemonade Server uses the following HTTP status codes, and what 
   each code indicates is given below: 
      - 200  
        - This indicates normal execution of the Lemonade commands 
           from a IMAP perspective.    The client should further parse 
           the response body to get the tagged responses to the 
           commands and process those accordingly. 
          
      - 500  
         - This indicates that at least one command caused an internal 
         server error, meaning the Lemonade Server failed to execute the 
         command. In conforming to HTTP semantics, this means the IMAP 
         server responses such as BAD or NO IMAP generate a HTTP 500 
         response code.   
 
   When using HTTP to transfer IMAP commands and responses, the client 
   SHOULD utilize built-in features of HTTP to their advantage.  For 
   example, the client SHOULD use HTTPS instead of HTTP whenever 
   possible, since HTTPS has built in encryption and MAY have 
   compression capabilities.  STARTTLS should not be needed in this 
   case, as it just requires additional overhead without any additional 
   benefit.

   HTTP can be used in both in-response and in-band modes.  Details 
   about these transport modes are given in the following two 
   subsections. 
    
    
2.1.1. Non-Persistent HTTP for In-response Connectivity Mode 
    
   If the client uses a traditional HTTP connection (either by 
   establishing a different socket for each HTTP request to the Lemonade 
   server, or by reusing the same socket for all HTTP requests, but 
   sending each request under its own header), it has in-response 
   connectivity to the server.  The client can issue as many commands as 
   it would like in one HTTP request to the server, and the server 
   responds by sending back one HTTP response with all the responses to 
   all the commands in the HTTP request.  With this connectivity mode, 
   the IDLE command cannot be issued. Other commands that use a 
   continuation response cannot be issued unless the 
   LITERAL+ [RFC2088] extension is supported.    
    
   In order for the server to identify separate HTTP requests as 
   belonging to the same session, an in-response HTTP client needs to 
   accept cookies.  A session-id is passed in the cookie to identify the 
   session.   
    
   Thus, the headers for a HTTP In-response Response after the client 
   has issued its first HTTP request to the server. 
    
      HTTP/1.1 <HTTP Status Code> <CRLF>   
      Content-Type: text/plain <CRLF> 
      Set-Cookie:JSESSIONID=94571a8530d91e1913bfydafa; 
   path=/lemonade<CRLF> 
      <CRLF> 
      [<untagged responses>] 
      <tag> SP <Lemnade Server response> <CRLF> 
      [[<untagged responses>] 
      <tag> SP <Lemonade Server response> <CRLF>] 
    
    
   The client must then save this cookie and send it back to the server 
   with the next request in order for the server to reattach these 
   commands to the same session as the previous commands. 
    
      POST /lemonadePath HTTP/1.1 <CRLF> 
      Content-Type: application/vnd.lemonade <CRLF> 
      Cookie: JSESSIONID=94571a8530d91e1913bfydafa 
      [other headers] 
      <CRLF> 
      <tag> SP <Lemonade command> <CRLF> 
      [<tag> SP <Lemonade command> <CRLF>]

2.1.2. Using Persistent HTTP/HTTPS + Chunked Transfer Encoding for In-
band Connectivity Mode 
    
   It is possible to use persistent HTTP or persistent HTTPS plus 
   chunked- transfer-encoding so that the server can instantly send 
   notifications to the client while a session is open.  The client 
   needs to open a persistent connection and keep it active. In this 
   case, the HTTP headers must be sent the first time the client device 
   opens the connection to the Lemonade Server and these headers MUST 
   set the transfer coding to be chunk-encoded [RFC2616, Sec. 3.6.1]. 
   All subsequent client-server requests are written to the open 
   connection, without needing any additional headers negotiations. The 
   server can use this open channel to push events to the client device 
   at any time. In this case, the client SHOULD NOT accept cookies. 
    
   The client must send the HTTP headers one time only: 
    
      POST /lemonadeServletPath HTTP/1.1 <CRLF> 
      Content-Type: application/vnd.lemonade <CRLF> 
      Connection: keep-alive <CRLF> 
      Pragma: no-cache <CRLF> 
      Transfer-Encoding: chunked <CRLF> 
       
   The server responds with the following header: 
    
      HTTP/1.1 <HTTP Status Code> <CRLF> 
      Cache-Control: private 
      Keep-Alive: timeout=15, max=100 (or other suitable setting) 
      Connection: Keep-Alive 
      Transfer-Encoding: chunked 
      Content-Type: text/plain 
    
    
   Then the client can send a command anytime it wants with the 
   following format: 
      <length of Lemonade command, including bytes in CRLF> <CRLF> 
      <tag> SP <Lemonade command> <CRLF>  
      <CRLF> 
    
   And example of an actual client command is: 
      e <CRLF> 
      2 CAPABILITY<CRLF> 
      <CRLF> 
    
   The server responds to each command with as many untagged responses 
   as needed, and one tagged response, where each response is in the 
   format that follows:

      <length of a single response, including bytes in CRLF> <CRLF> 
      <tagged or untagged response> <CRLF>  
      <CRLF> 
    
   An actual Server response might be:

   LITERAL+ UIDPLUS IDLE XORACLE X-ORACLE-LIST X-ORACLE-COMMENT X-

      1b <CRLF> 
      2 OK CAPABILITY completed <CRLF> 
      <CRLF> 
     
    
   Note however that the HTTP protocol is in general not meant to be 
   used in such a way. To maintain such an open channel might be a 
   practical challenge to proxies/firewalls, which might not forward the 
   requests chunk by chunk to the server, and meanwhile route responses 
   back to the client chunk by chunk. Consequently the session closes. 
   Chunked transfer encoding requests MAY not be honored by an HTTP 
   server. In cases where such requests are denied, the client should be 
   prepared to use the non-chunked encoding technique from section 2.1 
    
    
   The same challenges exist for TCP session.  
    
   In any case, the session can be automatically started again by the 
   client after a lost connection or by the server through out-of-band; 
   after some defined time-out.  
    
 
2.1.3. Using HTTP Connect 
 
   If a HTTP proxy server is available to the client which supports the 
   HTTP CONNECT method, and the IMAP server the user wishes to reach 
   allows external connections outside the destination network’s 
   firewall, the client may wish to tunnel a regular TCP connection 
   through the HTTP proxy.  
    
      See [LUOTONEN] or section 5.2 of [RFC2817] for a detailed 
   description of the technique. Note that HTTP Proxy servers may not 
   honor all CONNECT requests, and may in fact, limit CONNECT requests 
   to a small number of common ports, such as 80, 443, 8080, etc. It is 
   advised that networks wishing to allow their users to use this 
   feature allow clients within their network to CONNECT to ports 25, 
   143, 587, and 993.

2.1.4. Using HTTP as a binding for SMTP 
 
      All of the techniques described in sections 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 may 
   be used for SMTP as well. The only difference between IMAP and SMTP 
   will be the HTTP URL used. Servers implementing the HTTP binding are 
   expected to differentiate between IMAP and SMTP protocol bodies via 
   the URL. 
 
2.2.     Using SOAP (Web Services) as a binding for IMAP 
 
   The SOAP binding attempts to map IMAP commands to SOAP methods, and 
   IMAP data types and grammar (atoms, lists, et al) to document-
   literals supplied as the soap body. This is essentially a tunneling 
   technique with a syntactic change. The following general encoding 
   rules are proposed: 
    
   IMAP commands are translated into SOAP methods of the same name, e.g. 
   the “FETCH” command becomes the “FETCH” SOAP method name. (UID FETCH 
   is mapped to UID_FETCH).  
   SOAP document literal style is used 
   Terminals in the IMAP grammar which represent atoms become elements. 
   (e.g. FLAGS becomes <FLAGS/>) Flags are stripped of leading backslash 
   and uppercased. 
   Non-terminals which of an ATOM followed by a single parameter are 
   represented as a non-empty element containing that parameter. (e.g. 
   CHARSET foo becomes <CHARSET>foo</CHARSET>, or SENTBEFORE date 
   becomes <SENTBEFORE>date</SENTBEFORE> 
   Lists are represented as <L> </L> containing zero or more elements 
   (including other <L>s) 
   Unless otherwise defined, if a particular keyword is followed by more 
   than one value, each value is encoded as <P>value</P> as placed as a 
   child element. E.g. APPEND mailbox SP flaglist SP literal becomes 
   <APPEND><P>mailbox</P><P><L><ANSWERED/><DRAFT/></L></P></APPEND> 
   Continuation responses and requests are encapsulated as <C>data</C> 
   Literals are encapsulated as <T>text</T> or <B>binary</B> 
   Unsolicited responses are encapsulates as <U>response</U> 
    The partial specifier is <P>offset.length</P> 
    The section specifier is <SECTION>…</SECTION> 
    A sequence set is wrapped as <SEQUENCE>sequence-set</SEQUENCE> 
    The IMAP response is encoded in <RESP>response</RESP> 
   Any responses which start with a number followed by an ATOM are 
   encoded as <ATOM>number</ATOM> 
    
   The following is an example encoding: 
    
   C: a1 FETCH 1:5,9 BODY[1.1.CONVERT(“TEXT/PLAIN”)]<1024.2048> 
    
   Becomes

   “FETCH”. The expected response would be zero or more <U> elements 
   containing <FETCH> elements which encode the returned data. 
    
   These rules are by no means complete and exhaustive, and more 
   stringent encoding rules are needed to encompass the full range of 
   IMAP extended ABNF. The above rules are provided as a starting point. 
    
   SOAP by itself adds considerable overhead to requests, so it would 
   not be recommended without some form of compression or compact 
   encoding such as “Fast Web Services” (X.695 “ASN.1 Support for SOAP, 
   Web Services and the XML Information Set”)[X.695]. However, SOAP may 
   provide some benefits over raw HTTP for those who have existing 
   investments in SOAP infrastructure. 
    
   As a final note, the above usage once again, assumes that the soap 
   server is not stateless and uses HTTP cookies to preserve IMAP 
   session state between requests. 
    
   Here’s an example session side by side with IMAP syntax(SOAP envelop 
   not shown): 
    
   C-SOAP: <LOGIN><P>username</P><P>password</P>  
   C-IMAP: a1 LOGIN username password 
    
   S-SOAP: <RESP><OK>LOGIN Ok</OK> 
   S-IMAP: * OK LOGIN Ok 
    
   C-SOAP: <SELECT>INBOX</SELECT> 
   C-IMAP: a2 SELECT INBOX 
    
   S-SOAP: <RESP> 
      <U><FLAGS><L><ANSWERED/><DRAFT/><FLAGGED/><SEEN/></L></FLAGS></U> 
      <U><OK><PERMANENTFLAGS><L><ANSWERED/><DRAFT/><FLAGGED/><SEEN/></L>
   </PERMANENTFLAGS></OK></U> 
      <U><EXISTS>1234</EXISTS></U> 
      <U><RECENT>0</RECENT></U> 
      <U><OK><UIDVALIDITY>12345678</UIDVALIDITY></OK></U>

3.   Security Considerations 
    
   HTTP binding has the same security requirements as IMAP when using an 
   in-response or inband connectivity mode.   
    
   The HTTPS protocol can be used to provide end-to-end security 
 
   Proxy-based implementations may still require payload encryption for 
   end-to-end security. 
    
   Caching is a concern. The client SHOULD use the HTTP Cache-Control 
   directive (no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate, or combinations 
   thereof) to inform proxy servers, origin servers, and client 
   libraries not to cache or store the HTTP response. To deal with HTTP 
   1.0 servers that may exist in the network, Pragma: no-cache should be 
   used as well. 
    
   Attacks on HTTP sessions and the HTTP server may also be a concern, 
   since the HTTP server is maintaining an authenticated session to the 
   IMAP server on behalf of the user in most cases. 
    
   Firewall administrators wishing to block stealth deployments of HTTP 
   IMAP bindings may block HTTP requests with Content-Type 
   application/vnd.lemonade via an application level firewall.

5.   Future Work 
    
   [1] Should an OPTIONS HTTP request be supported to allow a client to 
   probe HTTP binding capabilities, such as which protocol a given URL 
   is bound to, or whether chunking is supported? 
    
   [2] Should separate content types exist for IMAP and SMTP since the 
   entity body in the HTTP request is different? 
    
   [3] Standardizing the form of the URL for the binding may permit 
   firewall administrations to impose better filtering. 
    
   [4] Investigate WebDAV binding and any DAV extensions (if any) needed 
    
   [5] Investigate REST binding 
    
   [6] Present a detailed formalism for the possible methods: 
    
         - HTTP CONNECT 
         - HTTP POST (disconnected) 
         - HTTP POST + Chunked (persistent) 
         - SOAP 
         - DAV
