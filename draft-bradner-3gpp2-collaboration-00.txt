Status of this Memo

   This document is an Internet-Draft and is in full conformance with
   all provisions of Section 10 of RFC2026 [1].  This memo provides
   information for the Internet community. Distribution of this memo is
   unlimited.

   Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering
   Task Force (IETF), its areas, and its working groups. Note that other
   groups may also distribute working documents as Internet-Drafts.
    Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six
   months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents
   at any time. It is inappropriate to use Internet- Drafts as reference
   material or to cite them other than as "work in progress."

2. Conventions used in this document

   This document uses significant terminology that is specialized to
   IETF, 3GPP2, or their areas of work.  See appendix A for definitions
   of acronyms. The organizational definitions can be found in their
   respective web-sites.


3. Introduction

   This document contains a set of principles and guidelines that serves
   as the basis for establishing the collaboration between 3GPP2 and
   IETF, with the objective of securing timely development of technical
   specification that facilitate maximum interoperability with existing
   (fixed and mobile) Internet systems, devices, and protocols.

   Each organization will operate according to their own rules and
   procedures including rules governing IPR policy, specification
   elaboration, approval and maintenance.


4. Reasons For Collaboration

4.1 3GPP2 use of IETF Internet Standards

   In the further development of 3GPP2 specifications, the benefit of
   adopting Internet specifications has been identified.

   The preferred 3GPP2 approach is to use the Internet standards
   unchanged, if feasible. In any case, 3GPP2 has no intention to
   duplicate work performed in IETF.

   However, while this document recognizes the importance of 3GPP2
   interoperability with the existing Internet and hence the use of IETF
   standards, 3GPP2 recognizes that additions or modifications might be
   needed in order to make the IETF internet specification fulfil the
   needs of 3GPP2.


4.2 IETF access to 3GPP2 Wireless expertise

   The technical work in 3GPP2 is organized in Technical Specification
   Groups TSGs each with their area of responsibilities. TSG-A and TSG-C
   are responsible for the Radio Access networks based on CDMA and thus
   the experts in the areas of the characteristics of the physical
   transport. TSG-N is responsible for the Mobility Management and other
   core network protocol and functionalities. TSG-P is responsible for
   data services and applications. TSG-S is responsible for the service

   and system aspects including the overall architecture, security and
   O&M aspects. Contacts for the TSGs can be found on the 3GPP2 web-site
   www.3gpp2.org.


5. Document Sharing

   Both 3GPP2 and IETF encourage the sharing of draft documents that are
   of mutual interest.

   3GPP2 working documents are available on its official web-site, and
   are grouped according to the meeting. These documents can be found on
   the 3GPP2 ftp server, which is open to anyone, at
   ftp://ftp.3gpp2.org. 3GPP2 specifications, those that have completed
   the 15-day Steering Committee review, can be found at:
      http://208.45.131.70/docs/newsd/3GPP2_Specs_Doc_New.html

   IETF documents, including preliminary working documents ("Internet
   Drafts") are available on its web-site (http://www.ietf.org/) and
   various shadow sites.

   IETF representatives can obtain information about the 3GPP2 document
   and web-site structures by contacting the relevant 3GPP2 contact
   points indicated at the 3GPP2 web-site (www.3gpp2.org).

   3GPP2 representatives can obtain information about the IETF document
   and web-site structures by contacting the relevant IETF contact
   points, which are the Area Directors indicated at the IETF web-site
   (www.ietf.org).


6. Communication

   Whenever possible, informal communication at working level is
   encouraged.  The vast majority of the technical discussions and
   decision making at IETF is done over mailing lists. It is recommended
   that interested individuals subscribe to and participate in these
   lists.

   3GPP2 mailing lists, however, are not open to the general public. It
   is recommended that work of mutual interest be discussed on the
   relevant IETF mailing lists.

   When deemed necessary, formal communication between 3GPP2 and IETF is
   also permitted.  Relevant IETF Area Directors and 3GPP2 technical
   leadership are encouraged and authorized to facilitate such
   communications when needed.

7. Rapporteurs/coordinators

7.1 IETF coordination support in 3GPP2

   An IETF rapporteur function is established in 3GPP2 Steering
   Committee.

   The individual(s) appointed to undertake the responsibility of this
   function should be the initial contact point in 3GPP2 for matters
   pertaining to the 3GPP2-IETF cooperation. Of course, the chairman of
   Steering Committee can always be contacted.

   The 3GPP2-IETF rapporteur function, therefore, is expected to work
   with the concerned working groups and TSGs and support the
   interaction between 3GPP2 and IETF.


7.2 3GPP2 Liaison in IETF

   The preferred way for organizations to work with IETF is through the
   working groups. However, IETF has a limited number of liaison
   relationships with other organizations when conditions warrant the
   appointment of a specific person.

   The appointment of a specific person in IESG to function as a "3GPP2
   liaison" is proposed.

   The role of the 3GPP2 Liaison is to act as an initial contact point
   in IETF for administrative aspects of this collaboration that cannot
   easily be handled in other ways (e.g., at a technical level by
   interactions with IETF Working Groups or Area Directors). It is
   agreed that the role does not carry the expectation of attendance at
   3GPP2 meetings or participation in 3GPP2 administrative processes and
   anticipated that all liaison efforts assigned to this individual will
   be carried out by electronic mail.  It is understood that the liaison
   will not have the ability to make exceptions to, or special
   provisions for, IETF policies and procedures.


8. Participation

   In order to assist the information flow between the organizations,
   IETF can on a per case basis appoint a rapporteur to participate and
   represent IETF at 3GPP2 technical meetings.

   IETF meetings are open to any interested individuals.

   3GPP2 partners (OPs, MRPs) or individual members can participate in

INTERNET DRAFT                                             December 2000


   any of the IETF meetings, in accordance with the existing IETF
   procedures.

   3GPP2 meetings are also open to any interested individual, however
   such individuals do not have voting privileges. The meeting schedule
   can be found on the 3GPP2 web site.


9. Security Considerations

   This type of non-protocol document does not directly affect the
   security of the Internet.
