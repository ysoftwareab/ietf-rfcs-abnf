     CoAP Pub-Sub Profile for Authentication and Authorization for
                     Constrained Environments (ACE)
               draft-palombini-ace-coap-pubsub-profile-05

Abstract

   This specification defines a profile for authentication and
   authorization for publishers and subscribers in a pub-sub setting
   scenario in a constrained environment, using the ACE framework.  This
   profile relies on transport layer or application layer security to
   authorize the publisher to the broker.  Moreover, it relies on
   application layer security for publisher-broker and subscriber-broker
   communication.

1.  Introduction

   The publisher-subscriber setting allows for devices with limited
   reachability to communicate via a broker that enables store-and-
   forward messaging between the devices.  The pub-sub scenario using
   the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is specified in
   [I-D.ietf-core-coap-pubsub].  This document defines a way to
   authorize nodes in a CoAP pub-sub type of setting, using the ACE
   framework [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz], and to provide the keys for
   protecting the communication between these nodes.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Readers are expected to be familiar with the terms and concepts
   described in [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz], [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm]
   and [I-D.ietf-core-coap-pubsub].  In particular, analogously to
   [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz], terminology for entities in the
   architecture such as Client (C), Resource Server (RS), and

   Authorization Server (AS) is defined in OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] and
   [I-D.ietf-ace-actors], and terminology for entities such as the Key
   Distribution Center (KDC) and Dispatcher in
   [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm].

2.  Profile Overview

   The objective of this document is to specify how to authorize nodes,
   provide keys, and protect a CoAP pub-sub communication, as described
   in [I-D.ietf-core-coap-pubsub], using [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm],
   which itself expands the Ace framework ([I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz]),
   and profiles ([I-D.ietf-ace-dtls-authorize],
   [I-D.ietf-ace-oscore-profile]).

   The architecture of the scenario is shown in Figure 1.

       Figure 1: Architecture CoAP pubsub with Authorization Servers

   The RS is the broker, which contains the topic.  This node
   corresponds to the Dispatcher, in [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm].  The
   AS1 hosts the policies about the Broker: what endpoints are allowed
   to Publish on the Broker.  The Clients access this node to get write
   access to the Broker.  The AS2 hosts the policies about the topic:
   what endpoints are allowed to access what topic.  This node
   represents both the AS and Key Distribution Center roles from
   [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm].

   There are four phases, the first three can be done in parallel.

   1.  The Publisher requests publishing access to the Broker at the
       AS1, and communicates with the Broker to set up security.

   2.  The Publisher requests access to a specific topic at the AS2

   3.  The Subscriber requests access to a specific topic at the AS2.

   4.  The Publisher and the Subscriber securely post to and get
       publications from the Broker.

   This exchange aims at setting up 2 different security associations:
   on the one hand, the Publisher has a security association with the
   Broker, to protect the communication and securely authorize the
   Publisher to publish on a topic (Security Association 1).  On the
   other hand, the Publisher has a security association with the
   Subscriber, to protect the publication content itself (Security
   Association 2).  The Security Association 1 is set up using AS1 and a
   profile of [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz], the Security Association 2 is
   set up using AS2 and [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm].

   Note that, analogously to the Publisher, the Subscriber can also set
   up an additional security association with the Broker, using an AS,
   in the same way the Publisher does with AS1.  In this case, only
   authorized Subscribers would be able to get notifications from the
   Broker.  The overhead would be that each Subscriber should access the
   AS and get all the information to start a secure exchange with the
   Broker.

         '------------------------------- Security --------------'
                                        Association 2

   Note that AS1 and AS2 might either be co-resident or be 2 separate
   physical entities, in which case access control policies must be
   exchanged between AS1 and AS2, so that they agree on rights for
   joining nodes about specific topics.  How the policies are exchanged
   is out of scope for this profile.

3.  coap_pubsub_app Profile

   This profile uses [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm], which expands the ACE
   framework.  This document specifies which exact parameters from
   [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm] have to be used, and the values for each
   parameter.

   The Publisher and the Subscriber map to the Client in
   [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm], the AS2 maps to the AS and to the KDC,
   the Broker maps to the Dispatcher.

   Note that both publishers and subscribers use the same profile,
   called "coap_pubsub_app".

3.1.  Retrieval of COSE Key for protection of content

   This phase is common to both Publisher and Subscriber.  To maintain
   the generality, the Publisher or Subscriber is referred as Client in
   this section.

                  Figure 2: B: Access request - response

   Complementary to what is defined in [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz]
   (Section 5.1.1), to determine the AS2 in charge of a topic hosted at
   the Broker, the Broker MAY send the address of both the AS in charge
   of the topic back to the Client in the 'AS' parameter in the AS
   Information, as a response to an Unauthorized Resource Request
   (Section 5.1.2).  An example using CBOR diagnostic notation is given
   below:

                    4.01 Unauthorized
                    Content-Format: application/ace+cbor
                    {"AS": "coaps://as1.example.com/token,
                    coaps://as2.example.com/pubsubkey"}

                  Figure 3: AS1, AS2 Information example

   After retrieving the AS2 address, the Client MAY send a Pub Key
   Format Negociation Request to the AS, in order to request necessary
   information concerning the public keys in the group, as well as
   concerning the algorithm and related parameters for computing
   signatures in the group.  This request is a subset of the Token Post
   request defined in Section 3.3 of [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm],
   specifically including the parameters 'sign_info' and 'pub_key_enc'.
   The AS MUST respond with the response defined in Section 3.3 of
   [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm], specifically including the same
   parameters 'sign_info' and 'pub_key_enc'.

   After that, the Client sends an Authorization + Key Distribution
   Request, which is an Authorization Request merged with a Key
   Distribution Request, as described in [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm],
   Sections 3.1 and 4.1.  The reason for merging these two messages is
   that the AS2 is both the AS and the KDC, in this setting, so the
   Authorization Response and the Post Token message are not necessary.

   More specifically, the Client sends a POST request to the /token
   endpoint on AS2, with Content-Format = "application/ace+cbor" that
   MUST contain in the payload (formatted as a CBOR map):

   o  the following fields from the Authorization Request (Section 3.1
      of [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm]):

      *  'grant_type' set to "client_credentials",

      *  OPTIONALLY, if needed, other additional parameters such as
         'client_id'

   o  the following fields from the Key Distribution Request
      (Section 4.1 of [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm]):

      *  'type' set to 1 ("key distribution")

      *  'client_cred' parameter containing the Client's public key
         formatted as a COSE_Key, if the Client needs to directly send
         that to the AS2,

      *  'scope' parameter set to a CBOR array containing:

         +  the broker's topic as first element, and

         +  the string "publisher" if the client request to be a
            publisher, "subscriber" if the client request to be a
            subscriber, or a CBOR array containing both, if the client
            request to be both.

      *  'get_pub_keys' parameter set to the empty array if the Client
         needs to retrieve the public keys of the other pubsub members

      *  OPTIONALLY, if needed, the 'pub_keys_repos' parameter

   Note that the alg parameter in the 'client_cred' COSE_Key MUST be a
   signing algorithm, as defined in section 8 of [RFC8152].

   Examples of the payload of a Authorization + Key Distribution Request
   are specified in Figure 5 and Figure 8.

   The AS2 verifies that the Client is authorized to access the topic
   and, if the 'client_cred' parameter is present, stores the public key
   of the Client.

   The AS2 response is an Authorization + Key Distribution Response, see
   Section 4.2 of [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm], with Content-Format =
   "application/ace+cbor".  The payload (formatted as a CBOR map) MUST
   contain:

   o  the following fields from the Authorization Response (Section 3.2
      of [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm]):

      *  'profile' set to "coap_pubsub_app", as specified in Section 8.1

      *  OPTIONALLY 'scope', set to a CBOR array containing:

         +  the broker's topic as first element, and

         +  the string "publisher" if the client is an authorized
            publisher, "subscriber" if the client is an authorized
            subscriber, or a CBOR array containing both, if the client
            is authorized to be both.

   o  the following fields from the Key Distribution Response
      (Section 4.2 of [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm]):

      *  'kty' identifies a key type "COSE_Key", as defined in
         Section 8.2.

      *  'key', which contains a "COSE_Key" object (defined in
         [RFC8152], containing:

         +  'kty' with value 4 (symmetric)

         +  'alg' with value defined by the AS2 (Content Encryption
            Algorithm)

         +  'Base IV' with value defined by the AS2

         +  'k' with value the symmetric key value

         +  OPTIONALLY, 'kid' with an identifier for the key value

      *  OPTIONALLY, exp with the expiration time of the key

      *  'pub_keys', containing the public keys of all authorized
         signing members formatted as COSE_Keys, if the 'get_pub_keys'
         parameter was present and set to the empty array in the
         Authorization + Key Distribution Request

   Examples for the response payload are detailed in Figure 6 and
   Figure 9.

4.  Publisher

   In this section, it is specified how the Publisher requests, obtains
   and communicates to the Broker the access token, as well as the
   retrieval of the keying material to protect the publication.

                     Figure 4: Phase 1: Publisher side

   This is a combination of two independent phases:

   o  one is the establishment of a secure connection between Publisher
      and Broker, using an ACE profile such as DTLS
      [I-D.ietf-ace-dtls-authorize] or OSCORE
      [I-D.ietf-ace-oscore-profile].  (A)(C)

   o  the other is the Publisher's retrieval of keying material to
      protect the publication.  (B)

   In detail:

   (A) corresponds to the Access Token Request and Response between
   Publisher and Authorization Server to retrieve the Access Token and
   RS (Broker) Information.  As specified, the Publisher has the role of
   a CoAP client, the Broker has the role of the CoAP server.

   (C) corresponds to the exchange between Publisher and Broker, where
   the Publisher sends its access token to the Broker and establishes a
   secure connection with the Broker.  Depending on the Information
   received in (A), this can be for example DTLS handshake, or other
   protocols.  Depending on the application, there may not be the need
   for this set up phase: for example, if OSCORE is used directly.

   (A) and (C) details are specified in the profile used.

   (B) corresponds to the retrieval of the keying material to protect
   the publication end-to-end with the subscribers (see Section 6.1),

   Step (D) between Subscriber and AS2 corresponds to the retrieval of
   the keying material to verify the publication end-to-end with the
   publishers (see Section 6.1).  The details are defined in Section 3.1

   This step is the same as (B) between Publisher and AS2 (Section 3.1),
   with the following differences:

   o  The Authorization + Key Distribution Request MUST NOT contain the
      'client_cred parameter', the role element in the 'scope' parameter
      MUST be set to "subscriber".  The Subscriber MUST have access to
      the public keys of all the Publishers; this MAY be achieved in the
      Authorization + Key Distribution Request by using the parameter
      'get_pub_keys' set to empty array.

   o  The Authorization + Key Distribution Response MUST contain the
      'pub_keys' parameter.

   An example of the payload of an Authorization + Key Distribution
   Request and corresponding Response for a Subscriber is specified in
   Figure 8 and Figure 9.

      Figure 10: Phase 3: Secure communication between Publisher and

   The (E) message corresponds to the publication of a topic on the
   Broker.  The publication (the resource representation) is protected
   with COSE ([RFC8152]).  The (F) message is the subscription of the
   Subscriber, which is unprotected, unless a profile of ACE
   [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz] is used between Subscriber and Broker.
   The (G) message is the response from the Broker, where the
   publication is protected with COSE.

   The flow graph is presented below.

       Figure 11: (E), (F), (G): Example of protected communication

6.1.  Using COSE Objects To Protect The Resource Representation

   The Publisher uses the symmetric COSE Key received from AS2 in
   exchange B (Section 3.1) to protect the payload of the PUBLISH
   operation (Section 4.3 of [I-D.ietf-core-coap-pubsub]).
   Specifically, the COSE Key is used to create a COSE_Encrypt0 with
   algorithm specified by AS2.  The Publisher uses the private key
   corresponding to the public key sent to the AS2 in exchange B
   (Section 3.1) to countersign the COSE Object as specified in
   Section 4.5 of [RFC8152].  The CoAP payload is replaced by the COSE
   object before the publication is sent to the Broker.

   The Subscriber uses the kid in the countersignature field in the COSE
   object to retrieve the right public key to verify the
   countersignature.  It then uses the symmetric key received from AS2
   to verify and decrypt the publication received in the payload of the
   CoAP Notification from the Broker.

Internet-Draft             coap-pubsub-profile                 July 2019


   The COSE object is constructed in the following way:

   o  The protected Headers (as described in Section 3 of [RFC8152]) MAY
      contain the kid parameter, with value the kid of the symmetric
      COSE Key received in Section 3.1 and MUST contain the content
      encryption algorithm.

   o  The unprotected Headers MUST contain the Partial IV, with value a
      sequence number that is incremented for every message sent, and
      the counter signature that includes:

      *  the algorithm (same value as in the asymmetric COSE Key
         received in (B)) in the protected header;

      *  the kid (same value as the kid of the asymmetric COSE Key
         received in (B)) in the unprotected header;

      *  the signature computed as specified in Section 4.5 of
         [RFC8152].

   o  The ciphertext, computed over the plaintext that MUST contain the
      CoAP payload.

   The external_aad is an empty string.

   An example is given in Figure 12

   The encryption and decryption operations are described in sections
   5.3 and 5.4 of [RFC8152].

7.  Security Considerations

   In the profile described above, the Publisher and Subscriber use
   asymmetric crypto, which would make the message exchange quite heavy
   for small constrained devices.  Moreover, all Subscribers must be
   able to access the public keys of all the Publishers to a specific
   topic to be able to verify the publications.  Such a database could
   be set up and managed by the same entity having control of the topic,
   i.e. AS2.

   An application where it is not critical that only authorized
   Publishers can publish on a topic may decide not to make use of the
   asymmetric crypto and only use symmetric encryption/MAC to
   confidentiality and integrity protect the publication, but this is
   not recommended since, as a result, any authorized Subscribers with
   access to the Broker may forge unauthorized publications without
   being detected.  In this symmetric case the Subscribers would only
   need one symmetric key per topic, and would not need to know any
   information about the Publishers, that can be anonymous to it and the
   Broker.

Internet-Draft             coap-pubsub-profile                 July 2019


   Subscribers can be excluded from future publications through re-
   keying for a certain topic.  This could be set up to happen on a
   regular basis, for certain applications.  How this could be done is
   out of scope for this work.

   The Broker is only trusted with verifying that the Publisher is
   authorized to publish, but is not trusted with the publications
   itself, which it cannot read nor modify.  In this setting, caching of
   publications on the Broker is still allowed.
