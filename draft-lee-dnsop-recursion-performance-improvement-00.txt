              An approach to improve recursion performance
          draft-lee-dnsop-recursion-performance-improvement-00

Abstract

   A recursive DNS server generally uses random port numbers to send
   outbound requests to protect against DNS spoofing attacks.  Due to
   the limitation of operation system, a process typically can only open
   numerable file descriptors simultaneously.  This limit reduces
   recursion performance of resolvers.  This draft offers an approach to
   improve both recursion performance and security for recursive
   servers.

1.  Introduction

   A recursive DNS server generally uses random port numbers to send
   outbound requests to avoid cache poisoning.  This is also essential
   to protect against Dan Kaminsky's DNS attack.  Due to the limitation
   of operation system, a process typically can only open numerable file
   descriptors simultaneously.  For example, the limitation on Linux is
   1024 by default.  Although this configuration could be modified by
   operation system operators, there is still a limit for maximum port
   number (65535).This limitation not only reduces recursion
   performance, but also makes resolvers vulnerable to attackers.
   Suppose that a hacker sends thousands of queries for domains which
   change irregularly and are actually not exist, the resolver must
   start corresponding recursive requests to authoritative servers as
   these domains are not cached, and soon, this resolver will not be
   able to generate more outbound requests because no more file
   descriptor can be open.

   This draft proposes an approach to solve this problem.  A resolver
   should reuse a group of fixed port numbers for outbound requests.  In
   this case, the resolver could improve recursion performance greatly
   as it avoids limitation of maximum file descriptors.  As for
   security, the resolver should add an extra recursive identifier(RQID)
   in EDNS0 record in outbound requests.  Authoritative servers should
   copy this RQID in EDNS0 record to the response packet.  The resolver
   then match up the reply using RQID option.  In this case, this
   approach improves security because a hacker can hardly correctly
   guess the randomized 32bit RQID besides the Transaction ID in DNS
   message header.

2.  Protocol changes

   This draft uses an EDNS0 ([RFC6891]) option to include recursive
   query ID(RQID) in DNS messages.  The option is structured as follows:

   o  (Defined in [RFC6891]) OPTION-CODE, 2 octets, for RQID is 10.

   o  (Defined in [RFC6891]) OPTION-LENGTH, 2 octets, use 4 as
      recommended.

   o  RQID, a 32 bit identifier(recommended) assigned by the resolver
      that generates a recursive query.  This RQID should be copied by
      authoritative server to the corresponding reply message and then
      be used by the resolver to match up the reply.

3.  Stub Resolver Considerations

   This approach is aimed to work between recursive servers and
   authoritative servers, a stub resolver by itself should determine if
   it has to support this RQID option.

4.  Recursive Server Considerations

   A resolver supporting RQID option should reuse fixed port numbers to
   send recursive queries to improve performance.  The port number could
   be configured by users and the RQID function should also be
   configurable.

   If the RQID function is enabled, a resolver should behave as follows:
   When sending a query, it generates a random 32 bit RQID (recommended)
   in the EDNS0 record as described above.  This RQID option indicates
   the resolver reuses its port to send recursive queries and expect the
   authoritative server to copy the RQID option in the responses.  When
   receiving a response, it should check RQID option in EDNS0 record in
   the response to match up the reply.  If the response contains no
   EDNS0 record or RQID option, the resolver itself should determine if
   to accept this reply.  For compatibility, it is recommended to accept
   these replies.  This could increase the risk of cache poisoning, but
   in most cases, the resolver should be secured by other
   equipments(firewalls etc).

   If a recursive server receives a query containing RQID option from
   stub resolver, it should copy this option in the reply.

5.  Authoritative Server Considerations

   If an authoritative server does not support RQID function, it just
   ignores RQID option in EDNS0 record.

   If a authoritative server supports RQID function, it should copy the
   RQID option in the reply.

6.  Performance Considerations

   The recursive query performance should be greatly improved as the
   resolver reuses port numbers to avoid the operation system limit of
   maximum file descriptors.

7.  Security Considerations

   This draft proposes an approach to use a RQID(32 bit as recommended)
   option to match up DNS replies.  If both the recursive and
   authoritative server support this option, the risk of cache poisoning
   is much lower than previous protocol.

   For compatibility, it is recommended to accept DNS replies which
   contain no RQID option.

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign the option code 10 for the RQID Option
   Code in the EDNS0 meta-RR.
