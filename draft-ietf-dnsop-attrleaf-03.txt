    DNS Scoped Data Through '_Underscore' Naming of Attribute Leaves
                      draft-ietf-dnsop-attrleaf-03

Abstract

   Formally, any DNS resource record may occur for any domain name.
   However some services have defined an operational convention that
   applies to DNS leaf nodes that are under a DNS branch that has one or
   more reserved node names that begin with an underscore.  The
   underscore naming construct defines a semantic scope for DNS records
   that are associated with the parent domain, above the underscored
   branch.  This specification explores the nature of this DNS usage and
   defines the "DNS Global Underscore Scoped Entry Registry" with IANA.
   The purpose of the Underscore registry is to avoid collisions
   resulting from the use of the same underscore-based name, for
   different services.

1.  Introduction

   The core Domain Name System (DNS) technical specifications assign no
   semantics to domain names or their parts, and no constraints upon
   which resource records (RRs) are permitted to be associated with
   particular names.[RFC1035] Over time, some leaf node names, such as
   "www" and "ftp" have come to imply support for particular services,
   but this is a matter of operational convention, rather than defined
   protocol semantics.  This freedom in the basic technology has
   permitted a wide range of administrative and semantic policies to be
   used -- in parallel.  DNS data semantics have been limited to the
   specification of particular resource records, on the expectation that
   new ones would be added as needed.  Unfortunately, the addition of
   new resource records has proved extremely challenging, over the life
   of the DNS, with significant adoption and use barriers.

1.1.  _Underscore Scoping

   As an alternative to defining new RRs, some DNS service enhancements
   call for using an existing resource record, but specify a restricted
   scope for its occurrence.  That scope is a leaf node, within which
   the uses of specific resource records can be formally defined and
   constrained.  The leaf occurs in a branch having a distinguished
   naming convention: At the top of the branch -- beneath the parent
   domain name to which the scope applies -- one or more reserved DNS
   node names begin with an underscore ("_").  Because the DNS rules for
   a "host" (host name) are not allowed to use the underscore character,
   this distinguishes the underscore name from all legal host names
   [RFC1035].  Effectively, this convention for leaf node naming creates
   a space for the listing of 'attributes' -- in the form of resource
   records -- that are associated with the parent domain, above the
   underscore sub-branch.

   The scoping feature is particularly useful when generalized resource
   records are used -- notably "TXT", "SRV", and "URI"
   [RFC1035],[RFC2782],[RFC7553].  It provides efficient separation of
   one use of them from others.  Absent this separation, an
   undifferentiated mass of these "RR"s is returned to the DNS client,
   which then must parse through the internals of the records in the
   hope of finding ones that are relevant.  Worse, in some cases the
   results are ambiguous because the records do not adequately self-
   identify.  With underscore-based scoping, only the relevant "RR"s are
   returned.

   A simple example is DKIM [RFC6376] , which uses "_domainkeys" for
   defining a place to hold a "TXT" record containing signing
   information for the parent domain.

   This specification formally defines how underscore labels are used as
   "attribute" enhancements for their parent domain names.  For example,
   domain name "_domainkey.example." acts as attribute of parent domain
   name "example."  To avoid collisions resulting from the use of the
   same underscore-based labels for different applications, this
   document establishes DNS Underscore Global Scoped Entry IANA Registry
   for the highest-level reserved names that begin with _underscore;
   _underscore-based names that are farther down the hierarchy are
   handled within the scope of the highest-level _underscore name.

   Discussion Venue:    Discussion about this draft should be directed
      to the dnsop@ietf.org [1] mailing list.

1.2.  Scaling Benefits for TXT, SRV, and URI Resource Records

   Some resource records are generic and support a variety of uses.
   Each additional use defines its own rules and, possibly, its own
   internal syntax and node-naming conventions to distinguish among
   particular types.  The "TXT", "SRV", and "URI" records are notable
   examples.  Their use can scale poorly, particularly when the same
   "RR" can be present in the same leaf node, but with different uses.

   An increasingly-popular approach, with excellent scaling properties,
   place the RR undr a node wit an underscore-based name, at a defined
   place in the DNS tree, so as to constrain to the use of particular
   "RR"s farther down the branch using that name.  This means that a
   direct lookup produces only the desired records, at no greater cost
   than a typical DNS lookup.

   The definition of a underscore global registry, provided in this
   specification, primarily attends to the "upper-level" names used for
   RRs; that is the _underscore "global" names.  For efficiency, a
   single, subordinate _underscore second-level table also is defined,
   for use with a common set of applications.

2.  DNS Underscore Scoped Entry Registries Function

   A global registry for DNS nodes names that begin with an _underscore
   is defined here.  The names are used to define scope of use for
   specific resource records, associated with the domain name that is
   the "parent" to the branch defined by the _underscore naming.

      A given name defines a specific, constrained context for one or
      more RR records, in which use of such records MUST conform to the
      defined constraints.  Within this scope, other resource records
      that are not specified MAY be used.

   The purpose of the Underscore Global Registry is to avoid collisions
   resulting from the use of the same _underscore-based name, for
   different applications.

   Structurally, the registry is defined as a single, flat table of
   names that begin with _underscore.  In some cases, such as for use of
   an "SRV" record, the full scoping name might be multi-part, as a
   sequence of underscore names.  Semantically, that sequence represents
   a hierarchical model and it is theoretically reasonable to allow re-
   use of a subordinate underscore name in different underscore context;
   that is, a subordinate name is meaningful only within the scope of
   the first (top-level) underscore name.  Therefore they are ignored by
   this DNS Underscore Global Scoped Entry Registry.  This registry is

   name used.

                        Example of Underscore Names

   Only the right-most names are registered in the IANA Underscore
   Global table.  Definition and registration of the subordinate names
   is the responsibility of the specification that creates the highest-
   level (right-most) registry entry.

   For convenience, an Underscore Common Second-Level Names table is
   also defined, to cover some popular cases involving the subordinate
   name used with two-level _underscore naming.  In particular, this
   table covers uses of second-level names that scope SRV RRs use.

3.  IANA Considerations

   Per [RFC8126], IANA is requested to establish two registries:

   1.  DNS Underscore Global Scoped Entry Registry

   2.  DNS Underscore Common Second-Level Scoped Entry Registry

   This section describes actions requested of IANA.  The guidance in
   [IANA] is used.

3.1.  DNS Underscore Global Scoped Entry Registry

   The DNS Global Underscore Scoped Entry Registry is for DNS node names
   that begin with the underscore character (_) and occur at the "top"
   of a DNS branch -- ie, are right-most -- under a "parent" domain
   name.

      This registry is to operate under the IANA rules for "First Come
      First Served" registration.

   The contents of each entry in the Global registry are defined in
   Section 2.1.

         author direct email, that indicates the exact details of
         changes needed to this table.  If a reference needs to be added

3.2.  DNS Common Second-Level Underscore Scoped Entry Registry

   A DNS Common Second-Level Underscore Scoped Entry Registry is for DNS
   node names that begin with the underscore character (_) and occur
   immediately below a Global ("top-level") node name beginning with an
   _underscore.

      This registry is to operate under the IANA rules for "First Come
      First Served" registration.
