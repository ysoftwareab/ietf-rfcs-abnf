Abstract

   The Rich Presence Information Data Format (RPID) adds elements to the
   Presence Information Data Format (PIDF) that provide additional
   information about the presentity and its contacts. This information
   can be translated into call routing behavior or be delivered to
   watchers, for example. The information is designed so that much of it
   can be derived automatically, e.g., from calendar files or user
   activity.

1 Introduction

   The PIDF definition [1] describes a basic presence information data
   format for exchanging presence information in CPIM-compliant systems.
   It consists of a <presence> root element, zero or more <tuple>
   elements carrying presence information, zero or more <note> elements
   and zero or more extension elements from other name spaces.  Each
   tuple defines a basic status of either "open" or "closed".

   This document provides additional status information for presentities
   and defines a Rich Presence Information Data Format for Presence
   (RPID) to convey this information.

   This extension has three main goals:

        1.   Provide rich presence indication that is at least as
             powerful as common commercial presence systems. Such
             feature-parity simplifies transition to CPIM-compliant
             systems, both in terms of user acceptance and protocol
             conversion.

        2.   Maintain backwards-compatibility with PIDF, so that PIDF-
             only watchers and gateways can continue to function
             properly, naturally without access to the functionality
             described here.

   We make no assumptions how the information in the RPID is generated.
   Experience has shown that users are not always diligent about
   updating their presence status. Thus, we want to make it as easy as
   possible to derive RPID information from other information sources,
   such as calendars, the status of communication devices such as
   telephones, typing activity and physical presence detectors as
   commonly found in energy-management systems.

   The information in a presence document can be generated by a single
   entity or can be composed from information published by multiple
   entities.

   Many of the elements correspond to data commonly found in personal
   calendars. Thus, we attempted to align some of the extensions with
   the usage found in calendar formats such as iCal [10] and xCal [11],
   as noted below.

   Note that PIDF documents and this extension can be used in two
   different contexts, namely by the presentity to publish its presence
   status and by the presence server to notify some set of watchers. The
   presence server MAY compose, translate or filter the published
   presence state before delivering customized presence information to

   the watcher. For example, it may merge presence information from
   multiple PUAs, remove whole elements, translate values in elements or
   remove information from elements. Mechanisms that filter calls and
   other communications to the presentity can subscribe to this presence
   information just like a regular watcher and in turn generate
   automated rules, such as scripts [12], that govern the actual
   communications behavior of the presentity.

   The flow diagram below illustrates this process.


   presentity
      |
      --> publish
            |
            --> PA (filter)
                    --> notification 1 to A, B, C
                    --> notification 2 to D, E
                    --> notification 3 to F
                    --> notification 4 to script gen.



2 RPID Features

   Below, we summarize and motivate the major additional features that
   RPID adds to PIDF.

   The PIDF definition does not clearly describe what a <tuple>
   represents. We add an <class> element (Section 6.3) that allows a
   presentity to label tuples in ways that make sense to the presentity,
   e.g., to group similar tuples by name. The <contacttype> element
   describes whether a tuple is a device, a set of devices with a common
   address ("service"), a human face-to-face contact or a presentity.

   While the PIDF definition describes which means of communications are
   available for a presentity, it does not describe the activity that
   the presentity is currently engaged in. The <activity> (Section 6.2)
   element adds this information.

   The <idle> (Section 6.5) element indicates when the device was last
   used or simply whether it has been idle.

   To help the watcher gauge the appropriateness of different types of
   communications, we indicate the type of place the user is currently
   in, via the <placetype> element (Section 6.6) and hint at the privacy
   available via <privacy>.




H. Schulzrinne (ed.)                                          [Page 3]

Internet Draft                    RPID                     July 31, 2003


   PIDF defines a <timestamp> element indicating the date and time of
   the status change of a tuple. RPID adds a validity period for
   <activity>, <placetype> and <privacy> values, as a hint how long the
   current status is likely to be valid.

   An important sub-case is that a presentity is interruptible only
   under unusual circumstances, after mediation by some, typically
   human, authority such as a secretary or supervisor. We allow the
   presentity to convey that certain contact addresses actually belong
   to a different person, presumably one that can either interrupt the
   presentity or otherwise assist. The <relationship> (Section 6.8)
   element allows to indicate that a particular tuple refers to a
   different principal or presentity.

   Note that this document does not defined a new content type. Rather,
   it inherits the content type from [1], namely application/cpim-
   pidf+xml

3 Scope

   This extension does not replace media negotiation mechanisms defined
   for SIP (e.g. SDP [2]), therefore media negotiation (e.g., choice of
   voice and video codecs) MUST be performed according to [3]. This
   extension is only aimed to give the watchers hints about the
   presentity's preferences, willingness and capabilities to communicate
   before watchers initiate SIP-based communication with the presentity.

4 Terminology and Conventions

   This memo makes use of the vocabulary defined in the IMPP Model
   document [4]. Terms such as CLOSED, INSTANT MESSAGE, OPEN, PRESENCE
   SERVICE, PRESENTITY, WATCHER, and WATCHER USER AGENT in the memo are
   used in the same meaning as defined therein. The key words MUST,
   MUSTNOT, REQUIRED, SHOULD, SHOULDNOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL
   in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP XX, RFC
   2119 [5].

5 The Meaning of "open" and "closed"

   PIDF describes the basic status values of "open" or "closed" only as
   "have meanings of general availability for other communications
   means". We define "closed" in our context as meaning that
   communication to the contact address will in all likelihood not
   succeed, is undesired or will not reach the intended party. (For
   example, a presentity may include a hotel phone number as a contact.
   After check-out, the phone number will still ring, but reach the
   chambermaid or the next guest. Thus, it would be declared "closed".)
   For "pres" contacts, "closed" means that no presence status



H. Schulzrinne (ed.)                                          [Page 4]

Internet Draft                    RPID                     July 31, 2003


   information is available.


        The interpretation of "closed" was chosen since there is no
        other status value to indicate that a communications
        address is not reachable. Omitting the <contact> element
        does not work since it would confuse watchers that have not
        previously seen an "open" status for the same contact
        address.

6 RPID Elements

6.1 Introduction

   Below, we describe the RPID elements in detail.  <activity>, <idle>
   <placetype>, <privacy>, <relationship>, extend the PIDF <status>
   element, while <class> and <contacttype> extend the PIDF <tuple>
   element.

   In general, it is highly unlikely that a presentity will publish or
   announce all of these elements at the same time. Rather, these
   elements were chosen to give the presentity maximum flexibility in
   deriving this information from existing sources, such as calendaring
   tools, device activity sensors or location trackers, as well as to
   manually configure this information.

   The namespace URIs for these elements defined by this specification
   are URNs [6], using the namespace identifier 'ietf' defined by [7]
   and extended by [8]:


      urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:rpid-status
      urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:rpid-tuple



6.2 Activity Element

   The <activity> indication describes what the presentity is currently
   doing. This can be quite helpful to the watcher in judging how
   appropriate a communication attempt is and which means of
   communications is most likely to succeed and not annoy the
   presentity.  The activity indications correspond roughly to the
   category field in calendar entries, such as Section 4.8.1.2 of RFC
   2445 [9].


        Use of an enumerated, but extensible, set of activity



H. Schulzrinne (ed.)                                          [Page 5]

Internet Draft                    RPID                     July 31, 2003


        categories simplifies automated generation and processing
        of presence information. The categories can be readily
        selected from a drop-down list by the user or translated
        from the corresponding activity field in calendars.
        Recipients of this information can render at least a subset
        as icons, automatically translate them into different
        languages or convert them to sound "jingles" and speech, or
        use them to generate call processing rules.

   An activity indication consists of one or more values drawn from the
   list below, any other token string or IANA-registered values (Section
   10). Communities of interest such as a profession or an organization
   may define additional activity labels for their internal use.

        On-the-phone: The presentity is talking on the telephone. This
             activity is included since it can often be derived
             automatically.

        Away: The presentity is physically away from the device
             location.  This activity was included since it can often be
             derived automatically from security systems, energy
             management systems or entry badge systems.

        Appointment: The presentity has a calendar appointment.

        Holiday: This is a scheduled national or local holiday. This
             information can typically be derived automatically from
             calendars.

        Meal: The presentity is scheduled for a meal. This activity
             category can often be generated automatically from a
             calendar.

        Meeting: This activity category can often be generated
             automatically from a calendar.

        Steering: The presentity is controlling a vehicle, ship or
             plane.

        In-transit: The presentity is riding in a vehicle, such as a
             car, but not steering. Alternatively, the presentity MAY
             offer more specific information.

        Travel: The presentity is on a business or personal trip, but
             not necessarily in-transit. This category can often be
             generated automatically from a calendar.

        Vacation: This activity category can often be generated



H. Schulzrinne (ed.)                                          [Page 6]

Internet Draft                    RPID                     July 31, 2003


             automatically from a calendar.

        Sleeping: This activity category can often be generated
             automatically from a calendar, local time information or
             biometric data.

        Busy: User is busy, without further details. This activity
             category would typically be indicated manually.

        Permanent-absence: Presentity will not return for the
             foreseeable future, e.g., because it is no longer working
             for the company.

   The activity element MAY be qualified with the 'from' and value and
   the time until which is element is expected to be valid.

6.3 Class

   The 'class' attribute describes the class of the tuple. Multiple
   tuples can have the same class name within a presence document. The
   naming of classes is left to the presentity. The presentity can use
   this information to group similar tuples or to convey information
   that the presence agent can use for filtering.


        The class description is similar in spirit to the 'class'
        attribute of XML elements, used to support Cascading Style
        Sheets.

6.4 Contact-Type Element

   The <contacttype> element describes the type of the tuple.  A tuple
   can represent a communication facility ("device"), a face-to-face
   communication tuple ("in-person"), a set of devices offering a common
   service ("service"), or a whole presentity ("presentity"). Additional
   types can be registered with IANA.


        URI schema are insufficient to distinguish the different
        types of tuples. For example, a SIP URI can designate a
        single device, a presentity or a subgroup of devices.

6.5 Idle Element

   The <idle> records the absolute time and date the communication
   device was last used. This provides an indication as to how likely a
   user is to answer the device. A device that has not been used in a
   while may still be OPEN, but a watcher may choose to first contact a



H. Schulzrinne (ed.)                                          [Page 7]

Internet Draft                    RPID                     July 31, 2003


   device that is both OPEN and not marked as idle.

   The <idle> element can be empty if the presentity wants to indicate
   that the device has not been used for a while, but does not want to
   reveal the precise duration:


     <idle/>



   The <idle> SHOULD be included in the presence document if the idle
   time exceeds a user-setable threshold, with a RECOMMENDED default
   value of 10 minutes. Configuration MUST include the option to omit
   the timestamp.

6.6 Type of Place Element

   The <placetype> element describes the type of place the presentity is
   currently at. This offers the watcher an indication what kind of
   communication is likely to be appropriate. We define an initial set
   of values below:

        home: The presentity is in a private or residential setting, not
             necessarily the personal residence of the presentity, e.g.,
             including hotel or a friend's home.

        office: The presentity is in a business setting, such as an
             office.

        public: The presentity is in a public area such as a shopping
             mall, street, park, public building, train station, airport
             or in public conveyance such as a bus, train, plane or
             ship. Alternatively, the more detailed indications below
             may be provided.

        street: Walking in a street.

        public-transport: Any form of public transport, including
             aircraft, bus, train or ship.

        aircraft: The presentity is in a plane, helicopter or balloon.

        ship: Water vessel, boat.

        bus: Public bus.

        train: The presentity is traveling in a train.



H. Schulzrinne (ed.)                                          [Page 8]

Internet Draft                    RPID                     July 31, 2003


        airport: Airport, heliport or similar location.

        station: Bus or train station.

        mall: Shopping mall or shopping area.

        outdoors: General outdoors area, such as a park or city streets.

   This list can be augmented by free-text values or additional IANA-
   registered values (Section 10).

   The placetype element MAY be qualified with the 'from' and value and
   the time until which is element is expected to be valid. The relative
   to the publication of the presence information.


        The placetype element can be used by logic executing on the
        watcher or by a composer to filter, sort and label tuples.
        For example, a composer may have rules that limit the
        publication of "home" tuples to a subset of the watchers.

6.7 Privacy Element

   The <privacy> element indicates whether third parties may be able to
   hear or view parts of the communication.

        public: Others may be able to see or hear the communications.

        private: Inappropriate individuals are not likely to see or hear
             the communications.

        quiet: The presentity is in a place such as a library,
             restaurant, place-of-worship, or theater that discourages
             noise, conversation and other distractions.

   This indication is not limited to voice communications. For example,
   a presentity might label her privacy as "quiet" when giving a talk,
   since it would be inappropriate if an instant message popped up on
   the laptop screen that is being projected for the audience.


        The placetype element can be used by logic executing on the
        watcher or by a composer to filter, sort and label tuples.
        For example, a composer may have rules that limit the
        publication of tuples labeled as "quiet" to a select subset
        of the watchers.

   The activity element MAY be qualified with the 'from' and value and



H. Schulzrinne (ed.)                                          [Page 9]

   the time until which is element is expected to be valid. The relative
   to the publication of the presence information.

6.8 Relationship Element

   The <relationship> element designates the type of relationship an
   alternate contact has with the presentity. This element is provided
   only if the tuple refers to somebody other than the presentity.
   Relationship values include "family", "associate" (e.g., for a
   colleague), "assistant", "supervisor". Other free-text values and
   additional IANA-registered values (Section 10) can be used as well.

   The <contact> element for tuples labeled with a relationship can
   contain either a communication URI such as "im", "sip"/"sips",
   "h323", "tel" or "mailto", or a presence URI, such as "pres" or
   "sip".

9 Security Considerations

   The security considerations in [1] apply, as well as [9]. Compared to
   PIDF, this presence document format reveals additional information
   that can be highly sensitive. Beyond traditional security measures to
   protect confidentiality and integrity, systems should offer a means
   to selectively reveal information to particular watchers and to
   inspect the information that is being published, particularly if it
   is generated automatically from other sources, such as calendars or
   sensors.

   Like any information retrieved by reference, the information provided
   in the <card>, <icon> and <info> elements may refer to data types
   that expose the watcher to security risks.

10 IANA Considerations

   This document calls for IANA to:

        o register two new XML namespace URNs per [8];

        o establish registry for activity categories (Section 6.2),
          place types (Section 6.6), and relationships (Section 6.8).

   Note that this document does not need a new content type. It inherits
   the content type from [1], namely application/cpim-pidf+xml

10.3 Place Type, Tuple Type, Activities, Relationships

   This document creates new IANA registries for activities, tuple
   types, place types and relationships. All are XML tokens. Registered
   tokens must be documented at the time of registration, as most
   descriptions are expected to be brief.

   The SIMPLE working group, or, if no longer available, the SIP working
   group should be consulted prior to registration.

11 Acknowledgements

   The document reflects the discussion on the SIMPLE mailing list, with
   contributions from many individuals. Markus Isomaki, Hisham
   Khartabil, Jon Peterson and Brian Rosen provided detailed comments
   and suggestions.  The notion of external references in the <card>,
   <icon> and <info> elements is an evolution of the BINPIDF proposal by
   Khartabil et al.
