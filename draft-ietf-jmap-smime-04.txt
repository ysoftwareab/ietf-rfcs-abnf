1.  Introduction

   [RFC8621] is a JSON based application protocol for synchronising
   email data between a client and a server.

   This document describes an extension to JMAP for returning S/MIME
   [RFC8551] signature verification status, without requiring a JMAP
   client to download the signature body part and all signed body parts
   (when multipart/signed media type is used) or to download and decode
   CMS (when application/pkcs7-mime media type is used).

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Addition to the capabilities object

   The capabilities object is returned as part of the standard JMAP
   Session object; see the JMAP spec.  Servers supporting _this_
   specification MUST add a property called "urn:ietf:params:jmap:smime"
   to the capabilities object.

   The value of this property is an empty object in both the JMAP
   session _capabilities_ property and an account's
   _accountCapabilities_ property.

4.  Extension to Email/get for S/MIME signature verification

   [RFC8621] defines Email/get method for retrieving message specific
   information.  This document defines the following pseudo values in
   the _properties_ argument:
   o *smimeStatus*: If "smimeStatus" is included in the list of
   requested properties, it MUST be interpreted by the server as a
   request to return "smimeStatus" response property.

   o *smimeErrors*: If "smimeErrors" is included in the list of
   requested properties, it MUST be interpreted by the server as a
   request to return "smimeErrors" response property.
   o *smimeVerifiedAt*: If "smimeVerifiedAt" is included in the list of
   requested properties, it MUST be interpreted by the server as a
   request to return "smimeVerifiedAt" response property.
   o *smimeStatusAtDelivery*: If "smimeStatusAtDelivery" is included in
   the list of requested properties, it MUST be interpreted by the
   server as a request to return "smimeStatusAtDelivery" response
   property.  (It effectively the same as "smimeStatus" value calculated
   at the date/time of deliver, as specified by "receivedAt".)

   The "smimeStatus" response property is defined as follows:

   smimeStatus: "String|null". null signifies that the message doesn't
   contain any signature.  This property contains the S/MIME signature
   and certificate verification status calculated according to [RFC8551]
   and [RFC8550].  Possible string values of the property are listed
   below.  Servers MAY return other values not defined below.  Client
   MUST treat unrecognized values as "unknown" or "signed/failed".  Note
   that the value of this property might change over time.

   unknown  S/MIME message, but it is neither signed, nor encrypted.
      This can also be returned for a multipart/signed message which
      contains unrecognized signing protocol (for example OpenPGP).

   signed  S/MIME signed message, but the signature was not yet
      verified.  Some servers might not attempt to verify signature
      until a particular message is requested by the client.  JMAP
      servers compliant with this document SHOULD return "signed/
      verified" or "signed/failed" instead of this signature status.

   signed/verified  S/MIME signed message and the sender's signature was
      successfully verified, sender matches the From header field and
      the sender's certificate (and the certificate chain) is trusted
      for signing.

   signed/failed  S/MIME signed message, but the signature failed to
      verify.  This might be a policy related decision (message signer
      doesn't match the From header field), message was modified, the
      signer's certificate has expired or was revoked, etc.

   The "smimeStatusAtDelivery" response property has the same syntax as
   "smimeStatus", but calculated at the "receivedAt" date/time.  Unlike
   "smimeStatus", the "smimeStatusAtDelivery" response property value is
   immutable. "smimeStatusAtDelivery" allows clients to compare S/MIME
   signature verification status at delivery with the current status as

   returned by "smimeStatus", for example it helps to answer questions
   like "was the signature valid at the time of delivery?".

   The "smimeErrors" response property is defined as follows:

   smimeErrors: "String[]|null". null signifies that the message doesn't
   contain any signature or that there were no errors when verifying
   S/MIME signature.  (I.e. this property is non null only when the
   corresponding "smimeStatus" response property value is "signed/
   failed".)  Each string in the array is a human readable description
   (in the language specified in Content-Language header field, if any)
   of a problem with the signature or the signing certificate.  (See
   Section 3.8 of [RFC8620] in regards to how this is affected by the
   language selection.)  For example, the signing certificate might be
   expired and the message From email address might not correspond to
   any of the email addresses in the signing certificate.  Or the
   certificate might be expired and the JMAP server might be unable to
   retrieve CRL for the certificate.  In both of these cases there would
   be 2 elements in the array.

   The "smimeVerifiedAt" response property is defined as follows:

   smimeVerifiedAt: "UTCDate|null" (server-set). null signifies that the
   message doesn't contain any S/MIME signature or that there is a
   signature, but there was no attempt to verify it.  In all other cases
   it is set to the date and time of when S/MIME signature was verified
   the last time.

   "smimeStatus" and "smimeErrors" values are calculated at the time the
   corresponding JMAP request was processed (but see below about result
   caching), not at the time when the message was generated (according
   to it's Date header field value).  In all cases "smimeVerifiedAt" is
   set to time when "smimeStatus" and "smimeErrors" were last updated.
   As recalculating these values is expensive for the server they MAY be
   cached for up to 10 minutes from the moment when they were
   calculated.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  JMAP capability registration for "smime"

   IANA is requested to register the "smime" JMAP Capability as follows:

   Capability Name: "urn:ietf:params:jmap:smime"

   Specification document: this document

   Intended use: common

   Change Controller: IETF

   Security and privacy considerations: this document, Section 6

6.  Security Considerations

   Server side S/MIME signature verification requires the client to
   trust server verification code and configuration to perform S/MIME
   signature verification.  For example, if the server is not configured
   with some Trust Anchors, some messages will have "signed/failed"
   status instead of "signed/verified".

   Constant recalculation of S/MIME signature status can result in
   Denial-of-Service condition.  For that reason it is RECOMMENDED to
   cache results of signature verification for 10 minutes.
