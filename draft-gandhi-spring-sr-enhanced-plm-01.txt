Abstract

   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm.  SR is
   applicable to both Multiprotocol Label Switching (SR-MPLS) and IPv6
   (SRv6) data planes.  This document defines procedure for Performance
   Delay and Liveness Monitoring (PDLM) in Segment Routing networks.
   The procedure uses the probe messages defined in RFC 5357 (Two-Way
   Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) Light) and RFC 8762 (Simple Two-
   Way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP)) for SR Paths including SR
   Policies with both SR-MPLS and SRv6 data planes.

1.  Introduction

   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm and
   greatly simplifies network operations for Software Defined Networks
   (SDNs).  SR is applicable to both Multiprotocol Label Switching (SR-
   MPLS) and IPv6 (SRv6) data planes [RFC8402].  SR takes advantage of
   the Equal-Cost Multipaths (ECMPs) between source and transit nodes,
   between transit nodes and between transit and destination nodes.  SR
   Policies as defined in [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy] are

   used to steer traffic through a specific, user-defined paths using a
   stack of Segments.  Built-in Liveness Monitoring for detecting faults
   as well as Performance Delay Measurement (DM) and Loss Measurement
   (LM) are essential requirements to provide Service Level Agreements
   (SLAs) in SR networks.

   The One-Way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP) defined in [RFC4656]
   and Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) defined in [RFC5357]
   provide capabilities for the measurement of various performance
   metrics in IP networks using probe messages.  The TWAMP Light
   [Appendix I in RFC 5357] provides simplified mechanisms for active
   performance measurement in Customer IP networks by provisioning UDP
   paths that eliminates the need for control-channel signaling.
   Similarly, the Simple Two-way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP)
   [RFC8762] alleviates the need for control-channel signaling by using
   configuration data model to provision a test-channel.

   [I-D.gandhi-spring-twamp-srpm] defines procedure for performance
   measurement using TWAMP Light messages with user-defined IP/UDP paths
   in SR networks.  [I-D.gandhi-spring-stamp-srpm] defines similar
   procedure using STAMP messages in SR networks.  The procedure for
   one-way and two-way modes defined for delay measurement can also be
   applied to liveness monitoring of SR Paths.  However, it limits the
   scale for number of PM sessions and fault detection interval since
   the probe query messages need to be punted from the forwarding path
   (to slow path or control plane) and response messages need to be
   injected.

   For Liveness Monitoring, Seamless Bidirectional Forwarding Detection
   (S-BFD) [RFC7880] can be used in Segment Routing networks.  However,
   S-BFD requires protocol support on the reflector node to process the
   S-BFD packets as packets need to be punted from the forwarding path
   in order to send the reply thereby limiting the scale for number of
   PM sessions and fault detection interval.  In addition, S-BFD
   protocol does not have the capability today to enable performance
   delay monitoring in SR networks.  Enabling multiple protocols in SR
   networks, S-BFD for liveness monitoring and TWAMP Light or STAMP for
   performance delay monitoring increases the deployment and operational
   complexities in SR networks.

   This document defines procedure for Performance Delay and Liveness
   Monitoring (PDLM) in Segment Routing networks.  The procedure uses
   the probe messages defined in [RFC5357] (TWAMP Light) and [RFC8762]
   (STAMP) for SR Paths including SR Policies with both SR-MPLS and SRv6
   data planes.

2.3.  Reference Topology

   In the reference topology shown below, the nodes R1 and R5 are
   connected via Point-to-Point (P2P) SR Path such as SR Policy
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy] originating on node R1 with
   endpoint on node R5.

                       Figure 1: Reference Topology

2.4.  Loopback Mode

   In loopback mode, the sender node R1 initiates probe messages and the
   reflector node R5 forwards them back to the sender node R1 just like
   data packets for the normal traffic.  The probe messages are not
   punted at the reflector node and it does not process them and
   generate response messages.  The reflector node must not drop the
   loopback probe messages, for example, due to a local policy
   provisioned on the node.

3.  Probe Messages

   The TWAMP Light probe messages for delay measurement as defined in
   [RFC5357] or STAMP probe messages as defined in [RFC8762] are sent by
   the sender node R1 towards the reflector node R5 in loopback mode as
   shown in Figure 1.  The probe messages are sent by the sender node on
   the congruent path of the data traffic flowing on the SR Path.

   The destination UDP port number in the probe message is user-
   configured from the range specified in [RFC8762].  As specified in
   [RFC8762], the destination UDP port 862 is used in the probe messages
   by default.  The Source and Destination IP addresses in the probe
   messages are set to the reflector and the sender node addresses,
   respectively (representing the reverse path).  The IPv4 Time To Live
   (TTL) and IPv6 Hop Limit (HL) are set to 255.

   No PM session is created on the reflector node R5.  As the probe
   message is not punted on the reflector node for processing, the
   Sender copies the 'Sequence Number' in 'Session-Sender Sequence
   Number' field directly.  Also, the Sender Timestamp, Sender Error
   Estimate and Sender TTL fields [RFC5357] [RFC8762] in the probe

   message are not used.  The rest of the fields are set as defined in
   [RFC5357] [RFC8762]

   Timestamp format recommended is 64-bit PTPv2 [IEEE1588] as specified
   in [RFC8186] implemented in hardware.  In addition to adding the
   timestamp in the message, the "Error Estimate" field in the payload
   of the message can be updated using the procedure defined in
   [RFC4656].

3.1.  Example Provisioning Model

   An example of a provisioning model and typical measurement parameters
   for the user-configured destination UDP port is shown in Figure 2:


                               +------------+
                               | Controller |

    PDLM Mode                    /        \   Timestamp Format
       LB or Enhanced LB        /          \
    Network Programming Label  /            \

                             /                \
                            /                  \
                           v                    v

                       |       |            |       |
                       |   R1  |============|   R5  |
                       |       |  SR Path   |       |
                       +-------+            +-------+
                        Sender              Reflector

                   Figure 2: Example Provisioning Model

   Example of Measurement Protocol is TWAMP Light and STAMP, example of
   Timestamp Format is 64-bit PTPv2 [IEEE1588] and NTP, etc.

   The mechanisms to provision the sender and reflector nodes are
   outside the scope of this document.

4.  Performance Delay and Liveness Monitoring

   For performance delay and liveness monitoring of an SR Path including
   SR Policy, PM probes in loopback mode is used.  The PM probe messages
   are sent by the sender (head-end) node R1 to the reflector (endpoint)
   node R5 of the SR Policy as shown in Figure 1.

Internet-Draft  Performance and Liveness Monitoring in SR      June 2020


   The probe messages are sent using the Segment List (SL) of the
   Candidate-paths of the SR Policy
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy].  When a Candidate-path has
   more than one Segment Lists, multiple probe messages are sent, one
   using each Segment List.  The return probe messages are received by
   the sender node via IP/UDP [RFC0768] return path by default.  The
   Segment List of the return SR path can be added in the probe message
   header to receive the return probe message on a specific path using
   the mechanisms defined in [I-D.ietf-pce-binding-label-sid] and
   [I-D.ietf-pce-sr-bidir-path].

4.1.  Probe Message for SR-MPLS

   The TWAMP Light or STAMP probe messages for SR-MPLS data plane are
   sent using the MPLS header containing the label stack of the SR
   Policy as shown in Figure 3.  In case of IP/UDP return path, the MPLS
   header is removed by the reflector node.  The label stack can contain
   a reverse SR-MPLS path to receive the return probe message on a
   specific path.  In this case, the MPLS header will not be removed by
   the reflector node.

4.2.  Probe Message for SRv6

   The TWAMP Light or STAMP probe messages for SRv6 data plane are sent
   using the Segment Routing Header (SRH) [RFC8754] containing the
   Segment List of the SR Policy as shown in Figure 4.  In case of IP/
   UDP return path, the SRH is removed by the reflector node.  The
   Segment List can contain a reverse SRv6 path to receive the return
   probe message on a specific path.  In this case, the SRH will not be
   removed by the reflector node.

5.  Enhanced Performance Delay and Liveness Monitoring

   The enhanced performance delay and liveness monitoring of an SR Path
   including SR Policy is defined using the PM probes in loopback mode
   enabled with network programming.

5.1.  Loopback Mode Enabled with Network Programming

   In loopback mode enabled with network programming, both transmit (t1)
   and receive (t2) timestamps in data plane are collected by the probe
   messages sent in loopback mode as shown in Figure 5.  The network
   programming function optimizes the "operations of punt, add receive
   timestamp and inject the probe packet" on the reflector node and is
   implemented in hardware.  The payload of the probe message is not
   modified by any intermediate nodes.

         Figure 5: Loopback Mode Enabled with Network Programming

   The sender node adds transmit (t1) timestamp in the payload of the
   TWAMP Light or STAMP probe message and clears the receive (t2)
   timestamp.  The reflector node adds the receive timestamp in the
   payload of the received probe message without punting the message to
   slow-path (or control-plane).  The reflector node only adds the
   receive timestamp if the source or destination address in the probe
   message matches the local node address to ensure that the receive
   timestamp is returned by the intended reflector node.

   The network programming function enables the node to add receive
   timestamp in the payload of the probe message at a specific location
   which is locally provisioned consistently in the network.  In TWAMP
   Light message defined in Section 4.2.1 of [RFC5357] or STAMP message
   defined in [RFC8762] for delay measurement, the 64-bit receive
   timestamp is added at byte-offset 16 which is from the start of the
   payload.

5.2.  Probe Message with Network Programming for SR-MPLS

   In this document, new Timestamp Label (value TBD1) is defined for SR-
   MPLS data plane to enable network programming function for
   "timestamp, pop and forward" the received packet.

   In the probe message for SR-MPLS, Timestamp Label is added in the
   MPLS header as shown in Figure 6, to collect "Receive Timestamp"
   field in the payload of the TWAMP Light [RFC5357] or STAMP probe
   message.  The label stack for the reverse SR-MPLS path can be added
   after the Timestamp Label to receive the return probe message on a
   specific path.  When a node receives a message with Timestamp Label,
   after timestamping the message at a fixed location, the node pops the
   Timestamp Label and forwards the message using the next label or IP
   header in the message (just like the data packets for the normal
   traffic).

5.2.1.  Node Capability for Timestamp Label

   The ingress node needs to know if the egress node can process the
   Timestamp Label.  The signaling extension for this capability
   exchange is outside the scope of this document.

   Another way is to leverage a centralized controller (e.g., SDN
   controller) to program the ingress and egress nodes.  In this case,
   the controller MUST make sure (e.g., by some capability discovery
   mechanisms outside the scope of this document) that the egress node
   can process the Timestamp Label.

5.2.2.  Timestamp Label Allocation

   Timestamp Label (value TBA1) can be allocated using one of the
   following methods:

   o  Labels assigned by IANA with value TBA1 from the Extended Special-
      Purpose MPLS Values [I-D.ietf-mpls-spl-terminology].

   o  Labels allocated by a Controller from the global table of the
      egress node.  The Controller provisions the label on both ingress
      and egress nodes.

   o  Labels allocated by the egress node.  The signaling or IGP
      flooding extension for this is outside the scope of this document.

5.3.  Probe Message with Network Programming for SRv6

   In this document, new Endpoint function "Timestamp and Forward (TSF)"
   (value TBD2) is defined for Segment Routing Header (SRH) [RFC8754]
   for SRv6 data plane to enable network programming function for
   "timestamp and forward" the received message.

   In the probe message for SRv6, END.TSF function is added for the
   Endpoint Segment Identifier (SID) in SRH [RFC8754] as shown in
   Figure 7, to collect "Receive Timestamp" field in the payload of the
   TWAMP Light [RFC5357] or STAMP probe message.  When a node receives a
   packet with END.TSF function for the target SID which is local, after
   timestamping the packet at a fixed location, the node forwards the
   packet using the next SID or IP header in the packet (just like the
   packets for the normal traffic).

6.  ECMP Handling

   An SR Policy can have ECMPs between the source and transit nodes,
   between transit nodes and between transit and destination nodes.  The
   PM probe messages need to be sent to traverse different ECMP paths to
   monitor the liveness for an SR Policy.

   Forwarding plane has various hashing functions available to forward
   packets on specific ECMP paths.  In IPv4 header of the PM probe
   messages, sweeping of Destination Address in 127/8 range can be used
   to exercise different ECMP paths in the loopback mode as long as the
   return path is also SR-MPLS.  The Flow Label field in the outer IPv6
   header can also be used for sweeping to exercise different ECMP
   paths.

7.  Failure Notification

   Liveness failure for SR Path is notified when consecutive N number of
   return probe messages are not received at the sender node, where N is
   locally provisioned value.  Similarly, delay metrics are notified
   when consecutive M number of probe messages have measured delay

Internet-Draft  Performance and Liveness Monitoring in SR      June 2020


   values exceed user-configured thresholds (absolute and percentage),
   where M is also locally provisioned value.

   In loopback mode, the timestamps t1 and t4 are used to measure round-
   trip delay.  In loopback mode enabled with network programming, the
   timestamps t1 and t2 are used to measure one-way delay.

8.  Security Considerations

   The Performance Delay and Liveness Monitoring is intended for
   deployment in the well-managed private and service provider networks.
   As such, it assumes that a node involved in a monitoring operation
   has previously verified the integrity of the path and the identity of
   the reflector node.  If desired, attacks can be mitigated by
   performing basic validation and sanity checks, at the sender, of the
   timestamp fields in received probe messages.  The minimal state
   associated with these protocols also limits the extent of disruption
   that can be caused by a corrupt or invalid message to a single probe
   cycle.  Use of HMAC-SHA-256 in the authenticated mode protects the
   data integrity of the probe messages.  Cryptographic measures may be
   enhanced by the correct configuration of access-control lists and
   firewalls.

9.  IANA Considerations

   IANA maintains the "Special-Purpose Multiprotocol Label Switching
   (MPLS) Label Values" registry (see <https://www.iana.org/assignments/
   mpls-label-values/mpls-label-values.xml>).  IANA is requested to
   allocate Timestamp Label value from the "Extended Special-Purpose
   MPLS Label Values" registry:

       +-------------+---------------------------------+---------------+
       | Value       | Description                     | Reference     |

       | TBA1        | Timestamp Label                 | This document |
       +-------------+---------------------------------+---------------+

   IANA is requested to allocate, within the "SRv6 Endpoint Behaviors
   Registry" sub-registry belonging to the top-level "Segment-routing
   with IPv6 data plane (SRv6) Parameters" registry
   [I-D.ietf-spring-srv6-network-programming], the following allocation:
