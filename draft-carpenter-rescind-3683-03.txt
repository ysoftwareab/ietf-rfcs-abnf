Abstract

   This document restores the previous option of finite posting rights
   suspensions authorized by an Area Director.  It also abolishes the
   existing form of indefinite Posting Rights Action.  It obsoletes RFC
   3683 and RFC 3934, and updates RFC 2418.

Internet-Draft       Progressive Posting Suspensions        October 2006


1.  Restoring the intent of RFC 2418

   BCP 94 [RFC3934] had the effect of removing the option of
   progressively increasing the length of posting rights suspensions, as
   implicitly allowed by BCP 25 [RFC2418] section 3.2.  Suspensions
   longer than one month have been found to be necessary.  This document
   obsoletes [RFC3934] and updates [RFC2418] in such a way as to restore
   the intent of [RFC2418] while retaining the WG Chair's power under
   [RFC3934].

   Management of non-working group mailing lists is not currently
   covered by this BCP, but is covered by relevant IESG Statements,
   which may be located via http://www.ietf.org/IESG/Statements.html.


2.  Specific Changes to RFC 2418

   The following three paragraphs supersede the last paragraph of RFC
   2418, section 3.2:

   As in face-to-face sessions, occasionally one or more individuals may
   engage in behavior on a mailing list that, in the opinion of the WG
   Chair, is disruptive to the WG process.  Unless the disruptive
   behavior is severe enough that it must be stopped immediately, the WG
   Chair should attempt to discourage the disruptive behavior by
   communicating directly with the offending individual.  If the
   behavior persists, the WG Chair should send at least one public
   warning on the WG mailing list.  If the behavior still persists, and
   typically after one or more explicit warnings and consultation with
   the responsible Area Director, the WG Chair may suspend the mailing
   list posting privileges of the disruptive individual for a period of
   not more than 30 days.  Even while posting privileges are suspended,
   the individual must not be prevented from receiving messages posted
   to the list.  Like all other WG Chair decisions, any suspension of
   posting privileges is subject to appeal, as described in RFC 2026
   [RFC2026].

   This mechanism is intended to permit a WG Chair to suspend posting
   privileges of a disruptive individual for a short period of time.
   This mechanism does not permit WG Chairs to suspend an individual's
   posting privileges for a period longer than 30 days regardless of the
   type or severity of the disruptive incident.  However, further
   disruptive behavior by the same individual will be considered
   separately and may result in further warnings or 30 day suspensions
   by the WG Chair.

   If the disruptive behavior still persists and after explicit
   warnings, the Area Director, with the approval of the IESG, may

   request that the mailing list maintainer block the ability of the
   offending individual to post to the mailing list for periods longer
   than 30 days.  Other methods of mailing list control may be
   considered but must be approved by the AD(s) and the IESG.  Even
   while posting privileges are suspended, the individual must not be
   prevented from receiving messages posted to the list.  Like all other
   Area Director decisions, any such suspension of posting privileges is
   subject to appeal, as described in RFC 2026 [RFC2026].


3.  Rescinding RFC 3683

   BCP 83 [RFC3683] has been found troublesome and contentious in
   practice.  It is hereby rescinded.  Any suspensions in place under
   BCP 83 at the time of approval of this document are not affected.


4.  Security Considerations

   This document does not directly affect the security of the Internet.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request for IANA assignments.


6.  Acknowledgements

   about half of the first draft.  Useful comments were received from
