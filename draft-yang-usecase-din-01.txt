1.  Introduction

   Blockchain helps to establish cross industry mutual trust and
   cooperation, and provides the transmission of value and trust on top
   of current information network (i.e., Internet).  The following
   industries are studying the application of block chains: government,
   commerce, industry, finance, insurance, medical, education,
   communication, culture and art etc.

   Blockchain can play the following role in a company:

   o  Promoting internal cooperation and optimizing the existing
      process, thus improves the production efficiency.  Take an
      Internet service provider for example, the internal blockchain
      that involves product manager, develop team, QA team and service
      team, shall be able to trace each service features design,
      development and market feedback easily, thus accelerate the
      internal productivity.

   o  Improving the cooperation of eco-system players, to enlarge the
      overall benefit.  Take Internet service provider for example, by
      using blockchain, a service provide shall be able to cooperate
      with other other service providers to expand the overall business
      based on trust, such as, a social network service provider can
      coopertate with content (music, video, online game) providers.

   o  Expanding business to the whole industry, the whole society and
      the world, to form new business models.  For example, the social

      network providers shall be able to provide the capbility of user
      anthertication to vertical service providers (such as freight,
      supply chain, finance, rental).

   In this document, several important use cases based on blockchain are
   analyzed, including: blockchain based PKI system, blockchain as a
   service, interworking cross blockchain (exchange data and contracts
   cross chains).  For easy understanding, related solutions are also
   provided.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Terminology and Abbreviations

   The terminology and abbreviations used in this document are defined
   in this section.

   o  H(e)NB: Home (e)NodeB, An eNodeB is an end device of a Radio
      Access Network,it performs the same functionality of an eNodeB,
      but is deployed for indoor premises or public hotspots, using the
      local Internet connection to access operators' network.

   o  MNO: Mobile Network Operator

   o  SeGW: Security Gateway, an edge device that is Deployment on the
      boundary of an Operator's network, to connect HeNB device
      remotely.

4.  Use case 1: Secure connection management between devices using
    blockchain based PKI

   Digital certificates are widely used to negotiate secure channels
   between devices and to establish secure connections as defined in RFC
   5280 [RFC5280].  Accoding to communication model, there are two
   typical sceniaros: multiple devices are connected to the same
   centralized node (such as H(e)NBs connected to a MNO's SeGW), peer to
   peer connection (such as IoT devices).

4.1.  Centralized connected model

   Take the H(e)NB scenario for example, H(e)NB is a device that is
   installed in the office/home where the radio signal is weak or not
   covered by MNOs, to provide mobile network services (such as voice
   call, messaging).  H(e)NB access MNO's network via local user's

   Internet access (LAN), thus, security solution is needed to authorize
   the H(e)NB device and to secure the connection between H(e)NB device
   and MNO network border (SeGW), as shown in Figure 1.

              +-------+    CA1     +---------+
                      +------------+


                                 Figure 1

   Because SeGWs belongs to different operation domain, it is not
   possible to have them use certificates issued by the same CA, H(e)NB
   needs to configure the certificate of the SeGW that it is connected
   to accordingly.  Two important functions is provided by certificate,
   authentication of H(e)NB devices to make sure that it is not a fake
   one, and the establishment of secure end to end communication
   channels between H(e)NB and SeGW under an unsafe Internet network.
   For this reason, the manufacture can not preinstall any certificate
   for H(e)NB, the installiation of certificate is needed in the
   deploying stage.  The workers manually install the certificate into
   the H(e)NB.  In this way, the following problems occurs: first, the
   manually installiation is low efficiency and error-pronel; second,
   the certificate may be leaked out by the worker.  Whats more,
   reconfiguration are needed each time when the certificate is expired
   or withdrawn.

   The solution is:

   o  Establish a consortium blockchain, which SHALL be used to verify
      and store certificates.  H(e)NB manufacturers and operator join
      the chain as nodes, which are responsible for certificate
      verification and storage.

   o  A self-signed certificate for each H(e)NB device is generated by
      the manufacture when it is produced.

Internet-Draft           Use cases of Blockchain               June 2018


   o  This certificate shall be sent to blockchain nodes to be verified.

   o  The certificate is verified by the verification node.

   o  The certificate is recorded into the blockchain if the consensus
      achieved.

   o  At the time H(e)NB is installed and powered on, it's certificate
      will be used to establish connection to operator's SeGW.

   o  The SeGW interacts with the operator's blockchain node to verify
      the certification.

   o  If success, the secured connection between SeGW and H(e)NB shall
      be established automatically.

   o  The certificate is also used to idenfity and antenticate the
      H(e)NB itself.

   Note: Although in this case we uses the operator's H(e)NB scenario,
   this solution applies to other similar connection models, such as
   home gateway.

4.2.  Peer-to-peer connection model

   Take IoT scenario for example.  Currently, IoT devices always talk to
   each other via the network server (such as IoT application server).
   For privacy and security consideration, we want IoT devices that
   produced by different venders to talk with each other directly in
   security.  But we can not assume that all these devices be
   preinstalled with the certificates issued by the same CA.  The
   regular solution is to introduce a centralized bridge-CA.  The
   question is that, the bridge is lack efficiency and extensiblity.

   The blockchain provides a better solution:

   o  Establish a consortium blockchain, which SHALL be used to verify
      and store certificates.  CAs join the chain as nodes, which are
      responsible for certificate verification and storage.

   o  When a CA issue certificate for a device, the certificate shall be
      sent to blockchain nodes to be verified.

   o  The certificate is verified by the verification node.

   o  The certificate is recorded into the blockchain if it achieves
      consensus.

   o  At the time devices need direct connection, they will lookup their
      CA's node for centification verificaton.

   o  If success, the secured connection between devices directly and
      automatically.

4.3.  Summary

   The advantages of usging blockchain based PKI includes:

   o  High reliability and performance: each node holds a copy of
      consistent certificate data, supports multiple duplicates and
      parallel queries, and better data consistency.

   o  Low cost: automatic operation of block chain system, low
      maintenance cost; no payment needed for self signed certificate.

5.  Use case 2: Blockchain as a Service

   The value of blockchain in building a system of trust and
   collaboration has been proved by the industry, enterprises and
   industries are applying the blockchain.  However, not all enterprises
   are willing to establish and operate their own blockchain system
   because of costs.  Therefore, providing blockchain-as-a-service
   solution contributes to the rapid popularization of blockchain.

   The main requirements for blockchain-as-a-service may include:

   o  General proposed data format to support different applications,
      for storage/verification/resolvation.

   o  Define flexible, extensible interfaces/APIs that is easy for
      programming.

   o  Enhanced performance for future proof.

6.  Use case 3: Blockchain Interworking

   According to the current situation of the vertical development of the
   blockchain infrastructures and applications, the cross-chain
   interworking shall be a very important demand in the future.  Cross
   chain interoperability involves not only data, but also smart
   contracts, security and other aspects.

   Two OPTIONAL solutions for blockchain interworking:

   o  API/Interface invocation based, using interworking gateway.
