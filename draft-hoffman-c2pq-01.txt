       The Transition from Classical to Post-Quantum Cryptography
                         draft-hoffman-c2pq-01

Abstract

   Quantum computing is the study of computers that use quantum features
   in calculations.  For over 20 years, it has been known that if large-
   scale quantum computers could be built, they could have a devastating
   effect on classical cryptographic algorithms such as RSA and elliptic
   curve signatures and key exchange, as well as on encryption
   algorithms.  There has already been a great deal of study on how to
   create algorithms that will resist large-scale quantum computers, but
   so far, the properties of those algorithms make them onerous to adopt
   before they are needed.

   Small-scale quantum computers are being built today, but it is still
   far from clear when large-scale quantum computers that can be used to
   break classical algorithms with key sizes commonly used today will be
   available.  It is important to be able to predict when large-scale
   quantum computers usable for cryptanalysis will be possible so that
   organization can change to post-quantum cryptographic algorithms well
   before they are needed.

   This document describes quantum computing, how it can be used to
   attack classical cryptographic algorithms, and possibly how to
   predict when large-scale quantum computers will become feasible.

1.  Introduction

   Early drafts of this document use "@@@@@" to indicate where the
   editor particularly want input from reviewers.  The editor welcomes
   all types of review, but the areas marked with "@@@@@" are in the
   most noticeable need of new material.  (The editor particularly
   appreciates new material that comes with references that can be
   included in this document as well.)

1.1.  Disclaimer

   **** This is an early version of this draft. **** As such, it has had
   little in-depth review in the cryptography community.  Statements in
   this document might be wrong; given that the entire document is about
   cryptography, those wrong statements might have significant security
   problems associated with them.

   Readers of this document should not rely on any statements in this
   version of this draft.  As the draft gets more input from the
   cryptography community over time, this disclaimer will be softened
   and eventually eliminated.

1.2.  Executive Summary

   The development of quantum computers that can break classical
   cryptographic keys is at a very early stage.  None of the published
   examples of such quantum computers is useful in breaking keys that
   are in use today.  There is a great amount of interest in this
   development, and researchers expect large strides in this development
   in the coming decade.

   Because the world does not know when large-scale quantum computers
   that can break cryptographic keys will be available, organizations
   should be watching this area so that they have plenty of time to
   either change to larger key sizes for classical cryptography or to
   change to post-quantum algorithms.  See Section 5 for a fuller
   discussion of determining how to predict when large-scale quantum
   computers might become feasible.

1.3.  Terminology

   The term "classical cryptography" is used to indicate the
   cryptographic algorithms that are in common use today.  In
   particular, signature and key exchange algorithms that are based on
   the difficulty of factoring numbers into two large prime numbers, or




Hoffman                  Expires January 3, 2018                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft      Classical to Post-Quantum Crypto           July 2017


   are based on the difficulty of determining the discrete log of a
   large composite number, are considered classical cryptography.

   The term "post-quantum cryptography" is the invention and study of
   encryption, signature and key exchange algorithms that are not based
   on the difficulty of factoring numbers into two large prime numbers,
   nor on the difficulty of determining the discrete log of a large
   composite number.

   Note that these definitions apply to only one aspect of quantum
   computing as it relates to cryptography.  It is expected that quantum
   computing will also be able to be used against symmetric key
   cryptography to make it possible to search for a secret symmetric key
   using far fewer operations than are needed using classical computers
   (see Section 4 for more detail).  However, using longer keys to
   thwart that possibility is not normally called "post-quantum
   cryptography".

   There are many terms that are only used in the field of quantum
   computing, such as "qubit", "quantum algorithm", and so on.  Chapter
   1 of [NielsenChuang] has good definitions of such terms.

   The "^" symbol is used to indicate "the power of".  The term "log"
   always means "logarithm base 2".

1.4.  Not Covered: Post-Quantum Cryptographic Algorithms

   This document discusses when an organization would want to consider
   using post-quantum cryptographic algorithms, but definitely does not
   delve into which of those algorithms would be best to use.  Post-
   quantum cryptography is an active field of research; in fact, it is
   much more active than the study of when we might want to transition
   from classical to post-quantum cryptography.

   Readers interested in post-quantum cryptographic algorithms will have
   no problem finding many articles proposing such algorithms, comparing
   the many current proposals, and so on.  An excellent starting point
   is the web site <http://pqcrypto.org/>.  Another is the article on
   post-quantum cryptography at Wikipedia:
   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography>.

   In addition, various organizations are working on standardizing the
   algorithms for post-quantum cryptography.  For example, the US
   National Institute of Standards and Technology (commonly just called
   "NIST") is holding a competition to evaluate post-quantum
   cryptographic algorithms.  NIST's description of that effort is
   currently at <http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/post-quantum-crypto/>.

1.5.  Not Covered: Quantum Cryptography

   Outside of this section, this document does not cover "quantum
   cryptography".  The field of quantum cryptography is related to
   quantum computers, but not to cryptanalysis.  Quantum cryptography is
   used to share random values that cannot be observed by outside
   parties without discovery.

1.6.  Where to Read More

   There are many reasonably accessible articles on Wikipedia, notably
   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing>.

   @@@@@ Note to the CFRG: please review the various pages at Wikipedia
   and update them if they are wrong or out of date.  Doing so is
   incredibly helpful to the world.

   [NielsenChuang] is a well-regarded college textbook on quantum
   computers.  Prerequisites for understanding the book include linear
   algebra and some quantum physics; however, even without those, a
   reader can probably get value from the introductory material in the
   book.

   @@@@@ Maybe add more references that might be useful to non-experts.

2.  Brief Introduction to Quantum Computers

   A quantum computer is a computer that uses quantum bits (qubits) in
   quantum circuits to perform calculations.  Quantum computers also use
   classical bits and regular circuits: most calculations in a quantum
   computer are a mix of classical and quantum bits and circuits.

   @@@@@ This can be expanded and made less hand-wavy.

   Qubits are valuable in quantum computers when they are combined in
   calculations.  Combining qubits in a calculation requires that the
   qubits are correlated.  Correlating qubits requires much more effort
   than correlating classical bits (such as in registers or volatile
   memory), which is one of the main reasons that developing quantum
   computers has proven more difficult than early development of
   classical computers.

   @@@@@ Discuss measurements and how they have to be done with
   correlated qubits.

2.1.  Quantum Computers that Discover Cryptographic Keys

   Quantum computers are expected to be useful in the future for some
   problems that take up too many resources on a large classical
   computer.  However, this document only discusses how they might be
   used to discover cryptographic keys faster than classical computers.
   In order to discover cryptographic keys, a quantum computer needs to
   have a quantum circuit specifically designed for the type of key it
   is attempting to break.

   A quantum computer will need to have a circuit with thousands of
   qubits to be useful to discover the type and size keys that are in
   common use today.  Smaller quantum computers (those with fewer qubits
   and simpler circuits) are not useful for using Shor's algorithm (as
   discussed in Section 3.1) at all.  That is, no one has devised a way
   to combine a bunch of smaller quantum computers to perform the same
   attacks on cryptographic keys via Shor's algorithm as a properly-
   sized quantum computer.

   This is why this document uses the term "large-scale quantum
   computer" when describing ones that can be used to break keys: there
   will certainly be small-scale quantum computers built first, but
   those computers cannot be used to discover the type and size keys
   that are in common use today.

   A straight-forward application of Shor's algorithm may not be the
   only way for large-scale quantum computers to attack RSA keys.
   [LowResource] describes how to combine quantum computers with
   classical methods for breaking RSA keys at speeds faster than just
   using the classical methods.

2.2.  Physical Designs for Quantum Computers

   Quantum computers can be built using many different physical
   technologies.  Deciding which physical technologies are best to
   pursue is an extremely active research topic.  A few physical
   technologies (particularly trapped ions, super-conduction using
   Josephson junctions, and nuclear magnetic resonance) are currently
   getting the most press, but other technologies are also showing
   promise.

   @@@@@ It would be useful to have maybe two paragraphs about each
   physical design that is being actively pursued.

2.3.  Challenges for Physical Designs

   Different designs have different challenges to overcome before the
   physical technology can be scaled enough to build a useful large-
   scale quantum computer.  Some of those challenges include the
   following.  (Note that some items on this list apply only to some of
   the physical technologies

   Temperature:  Getting stable operation without extreme cooling is
      difficult for many of the proposed technologies.  The definition
      of "extreme" is different for different low-temperature
      technologies.

   Stabilization:  The length of time every qubit in a circuit holds is
      value

   Quantum control:  Coherence and reproducibility of qubits

   Error detection and correction:  Getting accurate results through
      simultaneous detection of bit-flip and phase-flip.  See
      Section 2.4 for a longer description of this.

   Substrate:  The material on which the qubit circuits are built.  This
      has a large effect on the stability of the qubits.

   Particles:  The atoms or sub-atomic particles used to make the qubits

   Scalability:  The ability to handle the number of physical qubits
      needed for the desired the circuit

   Architecture:  Ability to change quantum gates in a circuit

2.4.  Qubits, Error Detection, and Error Correction

   Researchers building small-scale quantum computers have discovered
   that correlating qubits often has a large rate of error, and that
   error increases rapidly over time.  Performing quantum calculations
   such as those needed to break cryptographic keys is not feasible with
   the current state of physical qubits.

   Researchers have also discovered that they do not need to rely only
   on the properties of physical qubits.  Instead, they can build
   "logical qubits" from multiple physical qubits, and these logical
   qubits have much lower error rates over much longer lifetimes.
   Currently, it is estimated that it takes hundreds or thousands of
   physical qubits to make a logical qubit.

   @@@@@ Lots more material should goe here.  We will need recent
   references for how many physical qubits are needed for each corrected
   qubit.  It's OK if this section has lots of references, but hopefully
   they don't contradict each other.

3.  Quantum Computers and Public Key Cryptography

   The area of quantum computing that has generated the most interest in
   the cryptographic community is the ability of quantum computers to
   find the secret keys in the RSA and Diffie-Hellman algorithms using
   many fewer operations than classical computers would need to use.  It
   is widely believed that factoring large numbers and finding discrete
   logs using classical computers increases with the exponential size of
   the key.  [RFC3766] describes in detail how classical computers can
   be used to determine keys; even though that RFC is over a decade old,
   no significant changes have been made to the process of classical
   attacks on RSA and Diffie-Hellman. @@@@@ CFRG: is that true?  Does
   RFC 3766 need to be updated?

   Shor's algorithm shows that these problems can be solved on quantum
   computers in polynomial time, meaning that the speed of finding the
   keys is a polynomial function based on the size of the keys, which
   would require significantly fewer steps than a classical computer.
   The definitive paper on Shor's algorithm is [Shor97].

3.1.  Explanation of Shor's Algorithm

   @@@@@ Pointers to understandable articles would be good here.

   @@@@@ Describe period-finding and why it applies to finding prime
   factors and discrete logs.

   @@@@@ Give the steps for applying Shor's algorithm to 2048-bit RSA.
   Describe how many rounds of the quantum subroutine would likely be
   needed.  Describe how many rounds of the classical loop would likely
   be needed.

   @@@@@ Give the steps for applying Shor's algorithm to 256-bit
   elliptic curves.  Describe how many rounds of the quantum subroutine
   would likely be needed.  Describe how many rounds of the classical
   loop would likely be needed.

3.2.  Properties of Large-Scale Quantum Computers Needed for Discovering
      Public Keys

   Researchers have built small-scale quantum computers that implement
   Shor's algorithm, factoring numbers with four or five bits.  These

   are used to show that Shor's algorithm is possible to realize in
   actual hardware.

   @@@@@ References are needed here.  Did they implement all of Shor's
   algorithm, including the looping logic in the classical part and the
   looping logic in the quantum part?

   @@@@@ Numbers and explanation is needed below:

   A quantum computer that can determine the secret keys for 2048-bit
   RSA would require SOME NUMBER GOES HERE correlated qubits and SOME
   NUMBER GOES HERE circuit elements.  A quantum computer that can
   determine the secret keys for 256-bt elliptic curves would require
   SOME NUMBER GOES HERE correlated qubits and SOME NUMBER GOES HERE
   circuit elements.

4.  Quantum Computers and Symmetric Key Cryptography

   Section 3 is about Shor's algorithm and compromises to public key
   cryptography.  There is a second quantum computing algorithm,
   Grover's algorithm, that is often mentioned at the same time as
   Shor's algorithm but, with respect to cryptanalysis, only applies to
   symmetric ciphers such as AES.  The definitive paper on Grover's
   algorithm is by Grover: [Grover96].  Grover later wrote a more
   accessible paper about the algorithm in [QuantumSearch].

   Grover's algorithm gives a way to search for keys to symmetric
   algorithms in the square root of the time that a normal exhaustive
   search would take.  Thus, a large-scale quantum computer that
   implemented Grover's algorithm could find a secret AES-128 key in
   about 2^64 steps instead of the 2^128 steps that would be required
   for a classical computer.

   When it appears that it is feasible to build a large-scale quantum
   computer that can defeat a particular symmetric algorithm at a
   particular key size, the proper response would be to use keys with
   twice as many bits.  That is, if one is using the AES-128 algorithm
   and there is a concern that an adversary might be able to build a
   large-scale quantum computer that is designed to attack AES-128 keys,
   move to an algorithm that has keys twice as long as AES-128, namely
   AES-256.

   It is currently expected that large-scale quantum computers that
   implement Grover's algorithm are expected to be built long before
   ones that implement Shor's algorithm are.  There are two primary
   reasons for this:

   o  Grover's algorithm is likely to be useful in areas other than
      cryptography.  For example, a large-scale quantum computer that
      implements Grover's algorithm might be used to help create
      medicines by speeding up complex problems that involve how
      proteins fold. @@@@@ Add more likely examples and references here.

   o  A large-scale quantum computer that can be used to break AES-128
      will likely much smaller (and thus easier to build) than one that
      implements Shor's algorithm for 256-bit elliptic curves or
      2048-bit RSA/DSA keys.

4.1.  Explanation of Grover's Algorithm

   @@@@@ Give the steps for applying Grover's algorithm to AES-128.

4.2.  Properties of Large-Scale Quantum Computers Needed for Discovering

   @@@@@ Numbers and explanation is needed below:

   A quantum computer that can determine the secret keys for AES-128
   would require SOME NUMBER GOES HERE correlated qubits and SOME NUMBER
   GOES HERE circuit elements.

   @@@@@ <https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.04965> indicates that the quantum
   part of the computer would have more than 2^80 quantum gates, which
   might be prohibitive for physical hardware.

5.  Predicting When Useful Cryptographic Attacks Will Be Feasible

   If quantum computers that perform useful cryptographic attacks can be
   built in the future, many organizations will want to start using
   post-quantum algorithms well before those computers can be built.
   However, given how few implementations of such quantum computers
   exist (even for tiny keys), it is impossible to predict with any
   accuracy when quantum computers that perform useful cryptographic
   attacks will be feasible.

   The term "useful" above is relative to the value of the material
   being protected by the cryptographic algorithm to the attacker.  For
   example, if the quantum computer attacking a particular key costs
   US$100 billion to build, costs US$1 billion a year to run, and can
   extract only one key a year, it is possibly useful to some
   governments, but probably not useful for attacking the TLS key used
   to protect a small mail server.  On the other hand, if later a
   similar computer costs US$1 billion to build, costs US$10 million a
   year to run, and can extract ten keys a year, many more keys become
   vulnerable.

   [BeReady] gives a simple way to approach the calculation of when one
   needs to deploy post-quantum algorithms.  In short, if the sum of how
   long you need your keys to be secure plus how long it takes to deploy
   new algorithms is longer than the length of time it will take for an
   attacker to create a large-scale quantum computer and use it against
   your keys, then you waited too long.

   @@@@@ If the following is wrong, it would be great to have references
   to replace this with

   To date, few people have done systematic research that would give
   estimates for when useful quantum-based cryptographic attacks might
   be feasible, and at what cost.  Without such research, it is easy to
   make wild guesses but those are not of much value to people having to
   decide when to start using post-quantum cryptography.

   For example, in [NIST8105], NIST says "researchers working on
   building a quantum computer have estimated that it is likely that a
   quantum computer capable of breaking 2000-bit RSA in a matter of
   hours could be built by 2030 for a budget of about a billion
   dollars".  However, the referenced link is to a YouTube video
   [MariantoniYoutube] where the researcher, Matteo Mariantoni, says
   "maybe you should not quote me on that".  [NIST8105] gives no other
   references for predictions on cost and availability of useful
   cryptographic attacks with quantum computers.

5.1.  Proposal: Public Measurements of Various Quantum Technologies

   In order to get a rough idea of when useful cryptographic attacks
   with quantum computers may be feasible, researchers creating such
   computers can demonstrate them when they can break keys an eighth the
   size of those in common use.  That is, given that 2048-bit RSA,
   256-bit elliptic curve, and AES-128 are common today, when a research
   team has a computer than can break 256-bit RSA, 32-bit elliptic
   curve, or AES-128 where only 16 bits are unknown, they should
   demonstrate it.

   Such a demonstration could easily be made fair with trusted
   representatives from the cryptographic community using verifiable
   means to pick the keys to break and verifying the time that it takes
   to break each key.  It might be interesting to run the same tests in
   classical computers at the same time to give perspective.

   Note that this proposal would only give an idea of how public
   progress is being made on quantum computers.  Well-funded military
   agencies (and possibly even criminal enterprises) could be way ahead
   of the publicly-visible computers.  No one should rely on just the

   This entire document is about cryptography, and thus about security.

   See Section 1.1 for an important disclaimer about this document and
   security.

   This document is meant to help the reader predict when to transition
   from using classical cryptographic algorithms to post-quantum
   algorithms.  That decision is ultimately up to the reader, and must
   be made not only based on predictions of how quantum computing is
   progressing but also the value of every key that the user handles.
   For example, a financial institution using TLS to protect its
   customers' transactions will probably consider its keys more valuable
   than a small online store, and will thus be likely to begin the
   transition earlier.
