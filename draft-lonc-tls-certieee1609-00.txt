 Transport Layer Security (TLS) Client authentication Using IEEE 1609-2
                              Certificate
                  draft-lonc-tls-certieee1609-00.txt

Abstract

   This document describes two types of certificates to authenticate TLS
   entities, the first type enables the use of a certificate specified
   by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)
   and the second by the European Telecommunications
   Standards Institute (ETSI).  This document defines a new
   extension to enable TLS entities authentication using one of the
   aforementioned certificate types.

1.  Introduction

   Usually, TLS uses X509 digital certificates [RFC5246] for
   authentication.  This document describes how to use a certificate
   specified by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
   (IEEE) [IEEE-ITS] or a certificate described by the European
   Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) [ETSI-ITS].

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Extension Overview

   In order to negotiate the use of IEEE or ETSI certificate-based
   authentication, clients MAY include an extension of type
   "accepted_and_supported_certificate_type" in the extended client
   hello.  The "extension_data" field of this extension SHALL contain a
   list of supported certificate types advertised by the client, where:

      enum { ieee(0), ets(1), x509(2), (255) } SupportedCertType;

      enum { ieee(0), etsi(1), x509(2), (255) } AcceptedCertType;

      struct {
          SupportedClientCertType supported_certificate_types<1..2^8-1>;
          AcceptedClientCertType accepted_certificate_types<1..2^8-1>;
      } SupportedAndAcceptedCertType;

      DistinguishedName certificate_authorities<0..2^16-1>;

   Supported_certificate_types
      A list of certificate types types that the client may support.

   Accepted_certificate_types
      A list of certificate types that the client may accept.

   certificate_authorities
      A list of the distinguished names as described in [RFC5246]



   If the TLS server is willing to accept using the extension described
   here, it selects one of the supported certificate types and one of
   the accepted certificate types and includes a certificate_authorities
   list in the extension described here. The CertificateRequest payload
   is omitted from the response. The same extension type and structure
   will be used for the server's response to the extension described
   here. Note that a server MAY send no certificate types if it either
   does not have an appropriate certificate to send in response to the
   extension defined here or it wishes to authenticate the client using
   other authentication methods. The client MAY at its discretion
   either continue the handshake, or respond with a fatal
   handshake_failure alert.

   The end-entity certificate's public key (and associated restrictions)
   has to be compatible with the certificate types listed in extension
   described here.

   At the end of the hello phase, the client generates the
   pre_master_secret, encrypts it under the server's public key, and
   sends the result to the server.

   For servers aware of the extension described here but not wishing to
   use it, it will gracefully revert to an ordinary TLS handshake or
   stop the negotiation.

   Clients return a response along with their certificates by
   sending the "Certificate" message and immediately after the
   "ClientKeyExchange" message.  The premaster secret is generated
   according to the cipher algorithm selected by the server in the
   ServerHello.cipher_suite.

3.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations described throughout [RFC5246] apply here
   as well.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new TLS extension
   "accepted_and_supported_certificate_type", assigned the value TBD
   from the TLS ExtensionType registry defined in [TLSEXT].
