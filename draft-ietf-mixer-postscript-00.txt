draft                PostScript body parts              Jan 96


    1.  Introduction

    This document describes methods for carrying PostScript
    information in the two standard mail systems MIME and
    X.400, and the conversion between them. It uses the
    notational conventions of [BODYMAP], and the conversion is
    further described in [MIXER].


    2.  The PostScript body part

    Carrying PostScript in X.400 was originally defined in RFC
    1494.  This specification carries that work forward now
    that RFC 1494 is obsoleted by [BODYMAP].

    The following Extended Body Part is defined for PostScript
    data streams.  It has no parameters.


      postscript-body-part EXTENDED-BODY-PART-TYPE
        DATA             OCTET STRING
        ::= mime-postscript-body

      mime-postscript-body OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=
                { mixer-bp-data 2 }


    3.  The Application/PostScript content-type

    In MIME, PostScript is carried in the body part
    "application/PostScript", which is defined in RFC 1521.


    4.  MIXER conversion

    X.400 Body Part: Extended Body Part, OID mime-postscript-body
    MIME Content-Type: application/postscript
    Conversion Type: No conversion

    The two representations of PostScript both contain a
    single stream of octets. This stream of octets can be
    copied with no problems between the representations. No
    other data needs to be converted.

    5.  OID Assignments

    This OID is also defined in [BODYMAP].

    POSTSCRIPT-MAPPINGS DEFINITIONS ::= BEGIN
    EXPORTS -- everything --;

    IMPORTS
       mixer-bp-data
           FROM MIXER-MAPPINGS

    id-mime-postscript-body OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=
            { mixer-bp-data 2 };

    END

    6.  Security issues

    The issues concerning PostScript and security are well
    discussed in RFC 1521. No additional security issues are
    identified by this memo.


    7.  Trademark issues

    PostScript is a trademark of Adobe Systems, Inc.
