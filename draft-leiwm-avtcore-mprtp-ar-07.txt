                    draft-leiwm-avtcore-mprtp-ar-07


Abstract

   Currently, most multimedia applications utilize a combination of 
   real-time transport protocol (RTP) and user datagram protocol (UDP). 
   Application programs at the source end format payload data into RTP 
   packets using RTP specifications and dispatch them using unreliable 
   UDP along a single path. Multipath transport is an important way to 
   improve the efficiency of data delivery. In order to apply the 
   framework of multipath transport system based on application-level 
   relay (MPTS-AR) to RTP-based multimedia applications, this document 
   defines a multipath real-time transport protocol based on 
   application-level relay (MPRTP-AR), which is a concrete 
   application-specific multipath transport protocol (MPTP). Packet 
   formats and packet types of MPRTP-AR follow the common rules 
   specified in MPTP profile. Based on MPRTP-AR, RTP-based multimedia 
   applications can make full use of the advantages brought by MPTS-AR.

1. Introduction

   Currently, most multimedia applications utilize a combination of 
   real-time transport protocol (RTP) [1] and user datagram protocol 
   (UDP). Application programs at the source end format payload data 
   into RTP packets using RTP specifications and dispatch them using 
   unreliable UDP along a single path. Multipath transport is an 
   important way to improve the efficiency of data delivery. In order to
   apply the framework of multipath transport system based on 
   application-level relay (MPTS-AR) [12] to RTP-based multimedia 
   applications, this document defines a multipath real-time transport 
   protocol based on application-level relay (MPRTP-AR), which is a 
   concrete application-specific multipath transport protocol (MPTP). 
   Packet formats and packet types of MPRTP-AR follow the common rules 
   specified in MPTP profile [12]. Based on MPRTP-AR, RTP-based 
   multimedia applications can make full use of the advantages brought 
   by MPTS-AR.

2. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3. Overview

   The protocol stack architecture of the MPRTP-AR is shown in figure 1.
   MPRTP-AR is divided into two sub-layers: RTP sub-layer and multipath 
   transport control (MPTC) sub-layer. RTP sub-layer is fully compatible
   with the existing RTP specifications and provides upper applications 
   with the same application programming interfaces (APIs) as those 
   provided by normal RTP. MPTC sub-layer provides essential support for
   multipath transport, including path management, flow partitioning, 
   subflow packaging, subflow recombination, subflow reporting and so 
   on. At the user agent sender, RTP sub-layer first formats the data 
   received from upper application into RTP packets and then passes them
   to lower MPTC sub-layer. MPTC sub-layer further formats the RTP 
   packets into MPRTP-AR data packets. At the user agent receiver, MPTC 
   sub-layer extracts the RTP/RTCP packet by removing the fixed header 
   fields of MPRTP-AR data packet from the received packet and passes it
   directly to upper RTP sub-layer. RTP sub-layer follows the normal 
   process defined in RTP specification to restore original data flow. 
   This design decision is to maximize backwards compatibility with 
   existing RTP applications. Moreover, MPRTP-AR can make full use of 
   real-time transport functions provided by normal RTP including 
   payload type identification, sequence numbering, timestamping and so 
   on.

          Figure 1. The protocol stack architecture of MPRTP-AR

   As defined in MPTP profile, MPRTP-AR packets are divided into two 
   types: MPRTP-AR data packets and MPRTP-AR control packets. MPRTP-AR 
   control packets include MPRTP-AR keep-alive packets and MPRTP-AR 
   report packets.

   Besides RTP packets, RTP sub-layer generates real-time transport 
   control (RTCP) packets following the normal RTCP defined in [1] to 
   provide the overall media transport statistics. So, payload content 
   of MPTC sub-layer includes both RTP packets and RTCP packets. In MPTC
   sub-layer, each RTP/RTCP packet is treated as an independent piece of
   payload data and packaged into an individual MPRTP-AR data packet. 
   RTCP packets may be treated the exact same as RTP packets which are
   distributed across multiple paths. In addition, as described in RTP 
   specification, RTCP traffic is limited to a small fraction of the 
   session bandwidth, which is recommended no more than five percent. 
   So, RTCP packets may also be treated differently from RTP packets and
   delivered along any one of active paths, such as the default path or 
   the best path among all active paths based on quality of delivery. 

   When RTP and RTCP packets are multiplexed, the RTCP packet type field
   occupies the same position in the packet as the combination of the 
   RTP marker (M) bit and the RTP payload type (PT). This field is used 
   to distinguish RTP and RTCP packets. It is RECOMMENDED that RTP 
   sub-layer follows the guidelines in the RTP/AVP profile [3] for the 
   choice of RTP payload type values, with the additional restriction in
   [4].

   MPRTP-AR keep-alive packets are used to keep relay paths alive

   actively by user agent. The user agent sender generates MPRTP-AR 
   keep-alive packets periodically for both active paths and non-active
   paths and sends them along the associated path. The user agent 
   receiver does nothing when receiving MPRTP-AR keep-alive packets.

   MPRTP-AR report packets are used to monitor the transport quality of 
   each active path and multiple concurrent paths. MPRTP-AR-aware user 
   agent MUST generate individual MPRTP-AR report packets for per 
   subflow. The user agent sender generates MPRTP-AR Subflow Sender 
   Report (SSR) packets for each subflow and sends them along the 
   associated active path. The user agent receiver generates a MPRTP-AR 
   Subflow Receiver Report (SRR) packet when receiving a MPRTP-AR SSR 
   packet and sends it along the default path. In addition, the user 
   agent receiver optionally generates MPRTP-AR Flow Recombination 
   Report (FRR) packets for the whole flow and send them to the user 
   agent sender along the default path. The user agent sender may modify
   its strategies of flow partitioning and scheduling based on the 
   transport quality feedback in MPRTP-AR SRR and FRR packets.

4. MPRTP-AR User Agent Behavior

   In addition to user agent behaviors defined in [12], MPRTP-AR user 
   agent needs to follow the following behaviors to support multipath 
   transport for RTP-based multimedia applications.

4.1 Flow Partitioning

   If multiple paths are used concurrently, the original multimedia 
   stream should be divided into several substreams. Considering the 
   characteristics of multimedia data, flow partitioning may be done 
   based on a number of factors, such as media type, encoding scheme and
   path characteristics. Flow partitioning methods can be divided into 
   coding-aware partitioning methods and coding-unaware partitioning
   methods. Coding-unaware partitioning methods can be performed in MPTC
   sub-layer. MPTC sub-layer does not care what media type (such as 
   audio and video) the payload data is and what coding method the 
   payload data uses. MPTC sub-layer dispatches the formatted RTP/RTCP
   packets passed from upper RTP sub-layer to multiple subflows 
   evenly based on the local information maintained, such as the 
   delivery quality of the associated active paths.

   For multimedia applications, a multistream coder using layered 
   coding, multiple description coding or object-oriented coding can 
   produce multiple compressed media flows. In this case, coding-aware 
   partitioning methods could be performed in RTP sub-layer. In layered
   coding, a flow is either the base layer or one of the enhancement 
   layers; in multiple description coding, a flow typically consists of
   packets from a description; in object-oriented coding, various 
 


Leiwm, et al.            Expires July 24, 2017                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                  MPRTP-AR                January 24, 2017


   objects are coded individually and placed in so-called elementary 
   steams. Each coding flow corresponds to a separate subflow, or 
   several coding flows are multiplexed into one subflow. Data 
   participant in this way can effectively reduce the correlations among
   subflows and adverse impact of different transport qualities among 
   multiple paths on the final quality of media data received in the 
   receiving end.

4.2 Subflow Packaging

   For each subflow, the assigned RTP packets are treated as payload 
   data and formatted into MPRTP-AR data packets. The initial SSSN is 
   randomly generated when the subflow is first established and the SSSN
   in subsequent subflow MPRTP-AR data packets for RTP packets is 
   monotonically increasing. The flow sequence number increments by one
   for each assigned RTP packet from upper application. The initial
   value of flow the sequence number SHOULD be random.

   The assigned RTCP packets are also formatted into MPRTP-AR data 
   packets except for the difference that the SSSN and FSN are fixed to
   zero.

4.3 Subflow and Flow Recombination

   The user agent receiver recombines the original data flow according
   to MPRTP-AR data packets received from multiple paths. After 
   receiving a MPRTP-AR data packet, MPTC sub-layer first extracts the
   RTP/RTCP packet by removing the fixed header fields of MPTP data 
   packet from the received packet and passes it directly to upper RTP 
   sub-layer. MPTC sub-layer has no need to restore firstly the order of
   each subflow using path identifier and SSSN in MPTP data packet 
   headers before passing the encapsulated RTP/RTCP packets up to RTP
   sub-layer. The RTP sub-layer follows the normal process defined in 
   RTP specification to recombine the original data flow.

4.4 Subflow Reporting

   User agent generates MPRTP-AR report packets for per subflow to 
   monitor the quality of path delivery. The user agent sender generates
   MPRTP-AR Subflow Sender Report (SSR) packets for each subflow and 
   sends them along the associated active path. The user agent receiver 
   generates a MPRTP-AR Subflow Receiver Report (SRR) packets when 
   receiving a MPRTP-AR SSR and sends it along the default path.

   The user agent sender calculates the transmission interval of 
   MPRTP-AR SSR packets according to some strategy. The user agent 
   sender may generate MPRTP-AR SSR packets at a constant rate. In this 
   case, it is recommended that the default interval of MPRTP-AR SSR 
 


Leiwm, et al.            Expires July 24, 2017                  [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                  MPRTP-AR                January 24, 2017


   packets be one second. The user agent sender may also generate 
   MPRTP-AR SSR packets at a variable rate. For example, the report 
   traffic is limited to a small fraction of the associated subflow data
   traffic. In this case, it is recommended that the fraction of the 
   subflow data traffic added for subflow report be fixed at 5%, which 
   makes reference to the recommended value in RTP specification. 

   Reception quality feedback is useful for the user agent sender who 
   may modify its strategies of flow partitioning and scheduling based 
   on the estimated transport qualities of multiple paths.

   Cumulative counts are used in both the MPRTP-AR SSR and SRR packets 
   so that differences may be calculated between any two reports to make
   measurements over both short and long time periods, and to provide 
   resilience against the loss of a report. The difference between the 
   last two reports received can be used to estimate the recent 
   transport quality of the associated path. The difference between the
   two reports with a longer time interval can be used to estimate the 
   long-term transport quality of the associated path. The NTP timestamp
   is also included so that rates may be calculated from these 
   differences over the interval between two reports. 

   An example calculation is the packet loss rate over the interval 
   between two MPRTP-AR SRR packets. The difference in the cumulative 
   number of packets lost gives the number lost during that interval. 
   The difference in the highest SSSNs received gives the number of 
   packets expected during the interval. The ratio of these two is the
   packet loss fraction over the interval. This ratio provides a 
   short-term packet loss measurement if the two reports are 
   consecutive. The loss rate per second can be obtained by dividing the
   loss fraction by the difference in NTP timestamps, expressed in 
   seconds. The number of packets received is the number of packets 
   expected minus the number lost. 

   In addition to the cumulative counts which allow both long-term and 
   short-term measurements using differences between reports, MPRTP-AR 
   SRR packets include an interarrival jitter field which provides 
   short-term measurement of network congestion from a single report. 
   Packet loss tracks persistent congestion while the jitter measure 
   tracks transient congestion. The jitter measure may indicate 
   congestion before it leads to packet loss. The interarrival jitter 
   field is only a snapshot of the jitter at the time of a report and is
   not intended to be taken quantitatively. Rather, it is intended for 
   comparison across a number of reports.

4.5 Flow Reporting

   The user agent receiver optionally generates MPRTP-AR Flow

Internet-Draft                  MPRTP-AR                January 24, 2017


   Recombination Report (FRR) packets for the whole recombined flow and
   sends them to the user agent sender along the default path. Real-time
   applications are generally latency- and loss rate-sensitive. 
   Therefore, the flow recombination reports include the cumulative 
   packet loss rate and interarrival jitter caused by out-of-order 
   packets which arrive at the receiver along different paths. The user 
   agent receiver calculates the transmission interval of MPRTP-AR FRR 
   packets according to some strategy. In this document, it is 
   recommended that the default interval of MPRTP-AR FRR packets be one 
   second. 

5. MPRTP-AR Packet Format

   Packet types and packet formats of MPRTP-AR follow the common rules 
   specified in MPTP profile. As defined in MPTP profile, MPRTP-AR 
   packets are divided into two types: MPRTP-AR data packets and 
   MPRTP-AR control packets. MPRTP-AR control packets include MPRTP-AR 
   keep-alive packets and MPRTP-AR report packets. For all the MPRTP-AR
   packets, the application-specific MPTP type (AMT) field in the fixed
   MPTP header is set to 1.

5.1 MPRTP-AR Data Packet

   As stated in section 3, the RTP packets and RTCP packets are packaged
   into MPRTP-AR data packets intact. Each RTP packet and RTCP packet 
   corresponds to a MPRTP-AR data packet.

5.1.1 MPRTP-AR Data Packet for RTP packet

   A MPRTP-AR data packet carrying a RTP packet consists of a fixed 
   eight-octet MPTP header and an intact RTP packet. An example is shown
   below:

   The MPTP packet type (T) field is set to 1 to indicate that this 
   packet is a MPRTP-AR data packet.

   The application-specific MPTP type (AMT) field is set to 1 to 
   indicate that this packet is a MPRTP-AR packet.

   For RTP-based multimedia applications, latency and jitter are the 
   primary concerns, and occasional packet lost is acceptable. So the
   delay bit in the type of service (TOS) field is set to indicate that 
   prompt delivery is important for this packet.

   The initial SSSN is randomly generated when the subflow is first 
   established. The SSSN is increased by one for each subsequent 
   MPRTP-AR data packets carrying RTP packets of the same subflow.

   The initial FSN is randomly generated when the multipath session is
   first established. The FSN is increased by one for each RTP packet.

5.1.2 MPRTP-AR Data Packet for RTCP packet

   A MPRTP-AR data packet carrying a RTCP packet consists of a fixed 
   eight-octet MPTP header and an intact RTCP packet. An example is 
   shown below:

   The application-specific MPTP type (AMT) field is set to 1 to 
   indicate that this packet is a MPRTP-AR packet.

   In a RTP session, RTCP packets have higher transmission requirements 
   of precedence and reliability than RTP packets. So the precedence and
   reliability bits of the type of service (TOS) field are set to 
   indicate that the payload data in this MPTP data packet is more 
   important and requires a higher level of effort to ensure delivery.

   The SSSN field and FSN field in MPRTP-AR data packets carrying RTCP
   packets are fixed to zero.

5.2 MPRTP-AR Control Packet

   MPRTP-AR control packets include MPRTP-AR keep-alive packets and 
   MPRTP-AR report packets. MPRTP-AR report packets include MPRTP-AR 
   Subflow Sender Report (SSR) packets, MPRTP-AR Subflow Receiver Report
   (SRR) packets, and MPRTP-AR Flow Recombination Report (FRR) packets.

   MPRTP-AR SSR summarizes the data transmissions of the associated 
   subflow. The fields have the following meaning:   

   The MPTP packet type (T) field is set to zero to indicate that this 
   packet is a MPRTP-AR control packet.

   The application-specific MPTP type (AMT) field is set to 1 to 
   indicate that this packet is a MPRTP-AR packet whose packet formats 
   follow the rules specified in this document.

   The MPTP control packet type field is set to 1 to indicate that this
   packet is a MPRTP-AR SSR.

   NTP timestamp: 64 bits
      Indicates the wallclock time when this report was sent so that it
      may be used in combination with timestamps returned in receiver 
      reports to measure round-trip propagation to the user agent 
      receiver.

      Wallclock time (absolute date and time) is represented using the 
      timestamp format of the Network Time Protocol (NTP), which is in 
      seconds relative to 0h UTC on 1 January 1900 [5]. The full 
      resolution NTP timestamp is a 64-bit unsigned fixed-point number 
      with the integer part in the first 32 bits and the fractional part
      in the last 32 bits. An implementation is not required to run the 
      Network Time Protocol in order to use this MPTP extension. On a 
      system that has no notion of wallclock time but does have some 
      system-specific clock such as "system uptime", a user agent sender
      MAY use that clock as a reference to calculate relative NTP 
      timestamps.

   subflow's packet count: 32 bits

      The total number of MPRTP-AR data packets with non-zero SSSN value
      transmitted within a subflow by the user agent sender since 
      starting transmission up until the time this MPRTP-AR SSR packet 
      was generated.

   subflow's octet count: 32 bits
      The total number of payload octets (i.e., not including header or
      padding) transmitted in MPRTP-AR data packets by the user agent 
      sender since starting transmission up until the time this MPRTP-AR
      SSR packet was generated. This field can be used to estimate the 
      average payload data rate.

   MPRTP-AR SRR conveys statistics on the reception of MPTP data packets
   from a single subflow. The fields have the following meaning:

   The MPTP packet type (T) field is set to zero to indicate that this 
   packet is a MPRTP-AR control packet.

   The application-specific MPTP type (AMT) field is set to 1 to 
   indicate that this packet is a MPRTP-AR packet.

   The MPTP control packet type field is set to 2 to indicate that this
   packet is a MPRTP-AR SRR.

   The highest subflow-specific sequence number (SSSN) received: 16 bits
      The highest subflow-specific sequence number received in an 
      MPRTP-AR data packet from a subflow.

   Cumulative number of packets lost: 16 bits
      The total number of MPRTP-AR data packets from a subflow that have

      been lost since the beginning of reception. Note that a user agent
      receiver cannot tell whether any packets were lost after the last 
      one received. This number is defined to be the number of packets 
      expected less the number of packets actually received. The number 
      of packets expected is defined to be the highest SSSN of MPTP data
      packets received less the initial SSSN received. The number of 
      packets received includes any which are late. Thus, packets that 
      arrive late are not counted as lost. 

   Interarrival jitter: 32 bits
      An estimate of the statistical variance of the interarrival time 
      of the MPRTP-AR data packets with non-zero SSSN value in a 
      subflow, measured in timestamp units and expressed as an unsigned
      integer. The interarrival jitter J is defined to be the mean 
      deviation (smoothed absolute value) of the difference D in packet
      spacing at the user agent receiver compared to the user agent 
      sender for a pair of successive packets in a subflow. As shown in
      the equation below, the difference D is also equivalent to the 
      difference in the "relative transit time" for the two successive 
      packets; the relative transit time is the difference between a 
      packet's RTP timestamp and the user agent receiver's clock at the
      time of arrival, measured in the same units. 

      If Si is the RTP timestamp from packet i, and Ri is the time of 
      arrival in RTP timestamp units for packet i, then for two packets
      i and j, D may be expressed as

         D(i,j) = (Rj - Ri) - (Sj - Si) = (Rj - Sj) - (Ri - Si)

      The interarrival jitter SHOULD be calculated continuously as each
      MPTP data packet with non-zero SSSN value i is received from a 
      subflow, using this difference D for that packet and the previous
      packet i-1 in order of arrival (not necessarily in sequence), 
      according to the formula

         J(i) = J(i-1) + (|D(i-1,i)| - J(i-1))/16

      This algorithm is the optimal first-order estimator and the gain 
      parameter 1/16 gives a good noise reduction ratio while 
      maintaining a reasonable rate of convergence [11].

      Whenever a MPRTP-AR SRR is issued, the current value of J is 
      sampled.

   Last SSR timestamp (LSR): 32 bits
      The middle 32 bits out of 64 in the NTP timestamp received as part
      of the most recent MPRTP-AR SSR from a subflow. If no MPRTP-AR SSR
      has been received yet, the field is set to zero.

   Delay since last SSR (DLSR): 32 bits
      The delay, expressed in units of 1/65536 seconds, between 
      receiving the last MPRTP-AR SSR from a subflow and sending this 
      MPRTP-AR SRR. If no MPRTP-AR SSR has been received yet from this 
      subflow, the DLSR field is set to zero.

   The user agent sender can compute the round-trip propagation delay to
   the user agent receiver along a specific active path by doing the 
   following. The user agent sender records the time A when this 
   MPRTP-AR SRR is received, calculates the total round-trip time A-LSR 
   using the last SSR timestamp (LSR) field, and then subtracting this 
   field to leave the round-trip propagation delay as (A - LSR - DLSR).

   MPRTP-AR keep-alive packet is used to keep the active path alive. It 
   only contains a fixed eight-octet MPTP header.

   The MPTP packet type (T) field is set to zero to indicate that this 
   packet is a MPRTP-AR control packet.

   The application-specific MPTP type (AMT) field is set to 1 to 
   indicate that this packet is a MPRTP-AR packet.

   The MPTP control packet type field is set to 3 to indicate that this 
   packet is a MPRTP-AR keep-alive packet.

   MPRTP-AR FRR conveys statistics on the reception of MPTP data packets
   of the whole recombined flow. The fields have the following meaning:

   The MPTP packet type (T) field is set to zero to indicate that this 
   packet is a MPRTP-AR control packet.

   The application-specific MPTP type (AMT) field is set to 1 to 
   indicate that this packet is a MPRTP-AR packet.

   The MPTP control packet type field is set to 4 to indicate that this
   packet is a MPRTP-AR FRR.

   The highest Flow Sequence Number (FSN) received: 32 bits
      The highest flow sequence number received in an MPRTP-AR data 
      packet of the whole flow.

   Cumulative number of packets lost: 32 bits
      The total number of MPRTP-AR data packets of a whole flow that 
      have been lost since the beginning of reception. Note that a user
      agent receiver cannot tell whether any packets were lost after the
      last one received. This number is defined to be the number of 
      packets expected less the number of packets actually received. The
      number of packets expected is defined to be the highest FSN of 
      MPTP data packets received less the initial FSN received. The 
      number of packets received includes any which are late. Thus, 
      packets that arrive late are not counted as lost. 

   Interarrival jitter: 32 bits
      An estimate of the statistical variance of the interarrival time 
      of the MPRTP-AR data packets with non-zero SSSN value in a flow,
      measured in timestamp units and expressed as an unsigned integer.
      Its calculation method is identical as the field with the same 
      name.

6. SDP Considerations

6.1 Signaling MPTP Capability in SDP

   This document defines a new mptp-name value for the mptp-relay 
   attribute: "mprtp-ar" for RTP-based multimedia application-specific 
   MPTP, i.e. MPRTP-AR.

   RTP and RTCP packets are multiplexed to transport. So the rtcp-mux 
   attribute MUST be used in Session Description Protocol (SDP) [8] to 
   indicate support for multiplexing of RTP and RTCP packets [4]. When 
   an endpoint receives an SDP containing "a=mptp-relay" but without 
   "a=rtcp-mux", the endpoint MUST infer that the peer, if as a user 
   agent sender, supports multiplexing of RTP and RTCP packets.

   A user agent sender MAY use multiple paths concurrently to increase 
   throughput. If the desired media rate exceeds the current media rate,
   the user agent sender MUST renegotiate the application specific 
   ("b=AS:xxx") [8] bandwidth.

6.2 An Offer/Answer Example

   We take the usage scenario shown in Section 5.1 in [12] as an 
   example. Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [7] and SDP is used to 
   negotiate a multipath session following the offer/answer model [9].

   As recommended in [13] and [14], this example uses IPV6 addresses.

   User A includes an initial SDP offer in the session invitation 
   message. The initial SDP offer is shown as following. 

   Initial Offer:
      v=0
      o=alice 2890866901 2890866902 IN IP6 2001:db8:a0b:102::1

      a=rtpmap:98 H264/90000
      a=fmtp:98 profile-level-id=42A01E;
      a=mptp-relay:mprtp-ar
      a=rtcp-mux

   When the invitation message is processed by the server system, two 
   candidate relay paths are assigned for the media flow from user B to 
   user A. The initial SDP offer in the session invitation message is 
   modified as shown below. The IP addresses of RTP relay-1/relay-2/
   relay-3 are 2001:db8:a0b:103::1, 2001:db8:a0b:104::1 and
   2001:db8:a0b:105::1 respectively.
