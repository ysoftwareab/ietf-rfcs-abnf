                        draft-ietf-tram-alpn-06

Abstract

   Application Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) labels for Session
   Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) usages, such as Traversal Using
   Relays around NAT (TURN) and NAT discovery, are defined in this
   document to allow an application layer negotiate STUN usages within
   the Transport Layer Security (TLS) connection.  ALPN protocol
   identifiers defined in this document apply to both TLS and Datagram
   Transport Layer Security (DTLS).

1.  Introduction

   STUN can be securely transported using TLS-over-TCP (referred to as
   TLS [RFC5246]), as specified in [RFC5389], or TLS-over-UDP (referred
   to as DTLS [RFC6347]), as specified in [RFC7350].

   ALPN [RFC7301] enables an endpoint to positively identify an
   application protocol in TLS/DTLS and distinguish it from other TLS/
   DTLS protocols.  With ALPN, the client sends the list of supported
   application protocols as part of the TLS/DTLS ClientHello message.
   The server chooses a protocol and sends the selected protocol as part
   of the TLS/DTLS ServerHello message.  Application protocol
   negotiation can thus be accomplished within the TLS/DTLS handshake,
   without adding network round-trips.

   STUN protocol usages, such as TURN [RFC5766], can be used to identify
   the purpose of a flow without initiating a session.  This capability
   is useful and adds efficiency, as shown in the following scenarios.

   1.  Consider an Enterprise network that deploys a TURN server in a
       DeMilitarized Zone (DMZ) to audit all media sessions from inside
       the Enterprise premises to any external peer.  In this
       deployment, an Enterprise firewall could use the TURN ALPN
       identifier to detect the use of a TURN server that is outside the
       Enterprise domain (i.e., a TURN server provided by an application
       server, access network, etc).

   2.  If a firewall is configured to block all outgoing traffic except
       for TCP traffic to specific ports (e.g., 443 for HTTPS), a TURN

       server listening on its default ports (3478 for TCP/UDP, 5349 for
       TLS) would not be reachable.  However, despite the restrictions
       imposed by the firewall, a TURN server can still be reached on
       the allowed HTTPS port if the TURN ALPN identifier is used to
       establish usage of TURN as part of the TLS handshake.

   This document defines entries in the "Application Layer Protocol
   Negotiation (ALPN) Protocol IDs" registry established by [RFC7301] to
   identify STUN protocol usages.

2.  ALPN Labels for STUN

   The document proposes the following ALPN labels to identify STUN
   protocol [RFC5389] usages.

   'stun.turn':  Label to identify the specific use of STUN over (D)TLS
      for TURN (Section 4.6 of [RFC7350]).

   'stun.nat-discovery':  Label to identify the specific use of STUN
      over (D)TLS for NAT discovery (Section 4.1 of [RFC7350]).

3.  IANA Considerations

   The following entries are to be added to the "Application Layer
   Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) Protocol IDs" registry established by
   [RFC7301].

   The "stun.turn" label identifies the use of TURN usage (D)TLS:

      Protocol: Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN)

      Identification Sequence: 0x73 0x74 0x75 0x6E 0x2E 0x74 0x75 0x72
      0x6E ("stun.turn")

      Specification: This document (RFCXXXX)

   The "stun.nat-discovery" label identifies the use of STUN for the
   purposes of NAT discovery over (D)TLS:

      Protocol: NAT discovery using Session Traversal Utilities for NAT
      (STUN)

      Identification Sequence: 0x73 0x74 0x75 0x6E 0x2E 0x6e 0x61 0x74
      0x2d 0x64 0x69 0x73 0x63 0x6f 0x76 0x65 0x72 0x79 ("stun.nat-
      discovery")

      Specification: This document (RFCXXXX)

4.  Security Considerations

   The ALPN STUN protocol identifier does not introduce any specific
   security considerations beyond those detailed in the TLS ALPN
   Extension specification [RFC7301].  It also does not impact security
   of TLS/DTLS session establishment nor application data exchange.
