Abstract

   This MIB module defines a textual convention to represent BCP 47
   [RFC4646] language tags.  The intent is that this textual convention
   will be imported and used in MIB modules that would otherwise define
   their own representation.

Internet-Draft                 LANGTAG MIB                 November 2006


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   It defines a textual convention to represent BCP 47 [RFC4646]
   language tags.

   This document is part of work in progress to obsolete RFC 2932
   [RFC2932].  RFC 2932 defined a LanguageTag textual convention, but
   did so at an inappropriately scope; namely in a MIB module specific
   to IPv4 multicast routing.

   This draft aims to correct the structure of the MIB by placing this
   textual convention in a dedicated module that can be included without
   other dependencies.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

            this MIB module was published in RFC yyyy; for full legal
            notices see the RFC itself.  Supplementary information may

   DISPLAY-HINT "60a"
   STATUS      current
   DESCRIPTION
            "A language tag, constructed in accordance with BCP 47.

            Only lowercase characters are allowed.  The purpose of this
            restriction is to provide unique language tags for use as
            indexes.  BCP 47 recommends case conventions for user
            interfaces, but objects using this textual convention MUST
            use only lowercase.

            Values MUST be well-formed language tags, in conformance
            with the definition of well-formed tags in BCP 47.  An
            implementation MAY further limit the values it accepts to
            those permitted by a 'validating' processor, as defined in
            BCP 47.

            In theory, BCP 47 language tags are of unlimited length.
            This language tag is of limited length.  The analysis of
            language tag lengths in BCP 47 confirms that this limit
            will not pose a problem in practice.  In particular, this
            length is greater than the minimum requirements set out in
            section 4.3.1."

4.  Security Considerations

   This module does not define any management objects.  Instead, it



McWalter                  Expires May 25, 2007                  [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                 LANGTAG MIB                 November 2006


   defines several textual conventions that may be imported by other MIB
   modules and used for object definitions.

   Whenever using limited-size arrays to implement objects using the
   textual conventions defined by this MIB module, implementers are
   encouraged to check length and bounds on input and memory in order to
   avoid introducing buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

   SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c messages are not considered secure.  It is
   recommended that the implementors consider the use of SNMPv3 messages
   and the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.
   Specifically, the use of the User-based Security Model STD 62, RFC
   3414 [RFC3414] and the View-based Access Control Model STD 62, RFC
   3415 [RFC3415] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to a MIB is properly configured to give access
   to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change) them.

5.  IANA Considerations

   LANGTAG-MIB should be rooted under the mib-2 subtree.  IANA is
   requested to assign { mib-2 XXX } to the LANGTAG-MIB module specified
   in this document.

6.  Notes to the RFC editor

   This document should be published simultaneously with IPMCAST-MIB
   [I-D.ietf-mboned-ip-mcast-mib].

   This is because LANGTAG-MIB replaces the LanguageTag textual
   convention that is already present in RFC 2932, which will be
   obsoleted by the publication of IPMCAST-MIB.

   Normative references between LANGTAG-MIB and IPMCAST-MIB confirm this
   interdependency in publishing schedule.  After publication has
   occurred, there shall be no dependence from LANGTAG-MIB to IPMCAST-
   MIB.  The normative reference from this draft to IPMCAST-MIB should
   be removed at that time.  The normative reference from IPMCAST-MIB to
   this draft should remain.

7.  Acknowledgements

   This MIB module is a reworking of existing material from RFC 2932.

   Presuhn, Dan Romascanu, Bill Fenner, Juergen Schoenwaelder, and
