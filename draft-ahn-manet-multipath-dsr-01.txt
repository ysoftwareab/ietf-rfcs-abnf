Internet-Draft     DSR Extensions for Multipath Routing    November 2017


Abstract

   This document describes how DSR [1] can be extended for the support
   of MANET multipath routing. In DSR, the route record informatio is
   available at the destination, so the destination can select multiple
   routes with good characteristics and notify the source of them.
   Therefore, in this draft, we describe how we can extend the Route
   Request option to specify the number of routes selected at the
   destination.

Internet-Draft     DSR Extensions for Multipath Routing    November 2017


1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   
2.  Introduction

   The mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is composed of a number of mobile
   nodes which can communicate with each other through multiple wireless
   links without the help of a wired infrastructure. Therefore,
   in the MANET, the route connectivity tends to be very unstable.
   This route unstability can be mitigated by providing more than
   one route to a source and destination node pair. In recent years,
   there have been intensive studies done on multipath routing protocols
   for the MANET [2]. Also, multipath routing protocols may have the
   advantage of providing load balancing by distributing data traffic
   to a number of routes. On the other hand, it may incur more control
   message overhead to set up multiple routes.

   The DSR protocol [1] works based on the source routing mechanism
   and supports multiple routes between a source and destination node
   pair by maintaining several routes in the route cache
   of the source node. That is, DSR basically support multipath routing
   and the source routing capability makes the support of multipath
   routing easier. However, in DSR, a route reply (RREP) message
   with the information of a route is sent back to the source by an
   intermediate node which has a fresh route to the destination or
   by the destination itself. Hence, the source can collect a random
   number of the routes to the destination.

   In [3], the C flag is newly defined in the DSR Route Request option
   in order to resolve the cached route reply implosion problem of DSR.
   If the cached route reply capability is turned off (i.e., C = 0),
   the destination can collect all the route information from the
   source. So, it is possible for the destination to select those
   routes with good characteristics, such as link-disjoint,
   node-disjoint, etc. Therefore, in this draft, we extend the DSR
   Route Request option to allow the source to specify the maximum
   number of routes between the source and the destination, and
   to make the destination to select the specified number of routes
   from the obtained routes.

3.  Extensions on DSR Options Header


3.1 Extensions on DSR Route Request Option

   The Route Request option in the DSR Options header is extended as
   follows:


 0                   1                   2                   3
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|  Option Type  |  Opt Data Len |     Identification    |C|PC |R|
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|                         Target Address                        |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|                           Address[1]                          |

|                           Address[2]                          |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|                              ...                              |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|                           Address[n]                          |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   IP fields
      The same as described in [1].

   Route Request fields
      The same as described in [3] except for the PC field and R bit.

   PC (Path Count)
      This field indicates the maximum number of routes between the
      source and the destination. The default value of PC is 0 which
      implies a single route between the source and the destination.
      The source sets the PC value to the value which is one less than
      the required maximum number of routes. For the cases of nonzero
      PC values, the C bit has to be set to 0 (i.e., the cached route
      reply capability is disabled). When the destination receives
      an RREQ message with a nonzero PC value, it has to send back
      at most (PC+1) different RREP messages (routes) to the source.
      The mechanism to select those routes is out of the scope of
      this draft.

   R bit
      Reserved bit.
