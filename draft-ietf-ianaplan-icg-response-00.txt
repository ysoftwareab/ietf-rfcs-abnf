1.  IETF Introduction

   In March of 2014 the U.S.  National Telecommunications & Information
   Administration (NTIA) announced its intent to transition oversight of
   Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) functions.  In that
   announcement, NTIA asked the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names
   and Numbers (ICANN) to establish a process to deliver a proposal for
   transition.  As part of that process, the IANA Stewardship Transition
   Coordination Group (ICG) was formed.  They solicited proposals
   regarding the respective functions that IANA performs, in order that
   they may put forth a proposal to the NTIA.

   While there are interactions between all of the IANA functions and
   IETF standards, this document specifically addresses the protocol
   registries function.  Section 1 (this section) contains an
   introduction that is sourced solely within the IETF.  Section 2
   contains the questionnaire that was written by the ICG and a formal
   response by the IETF.  Because much of this memo is taken from a
   questionnaire we have quoted questions with ">>> " and we have
   prefaced answers to questions being asked with "IETF Response:".
   Note that there are small changes to the content of the questions
   asked in order to match the RFC format.

   As if to demonstrate the last point, the following text was included
   in a footnote in the original propsoal.

   In this RFP, "IANA" refers to the functions currently specified in
   the agreement between NTIA and ICANN [http://www.ntia.doc.gov/page/
   iana-functions-purchase-order] as well as any other functions
   traditionally performed by the IANA functions operator.  SAC-067
   [https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/sac-067-en.pdf] provides
   one description of the many different meanings of the term "IANA" and
   may be useful reading in addition to the documents constituting the
   agreement itself.

2.  The Formal RFP Response

   Introduction

   NOTE: This section is taken in its entirety from the questionnaire
   dated 8 September 2014.

   Under the IANA Stewardship Transition Coordination Group (ICG)
   Charter [ICG-CHARTER], the ICG has four main tasks:


       (i) Act as liaison to all interested parties in the IANA
           stewardship transition, including the three "operational
           communities" (i.e., those with direct operational or service
           relationships with the IANA functions operator; namely names,
           numbers, protocol parameters). This task consists of:

             a. Soliciting proposals from the operational communities
             b. Soliciting the input of the broad group of communities
                affected by the IANA functions
      (ii) Assess the outputs of the three operational communities
           for compatibility and interoperability
     (iii) Assemble a complete proposal for the transition
      (iv) Information sharing and public communication



   This Request for Proposals (RFP) addresses task (i) of the ICG
   Charter.  This RFP does not preclude any form of input from the non-
   operational communities.

   0.  Complete Formal Responses

   The IANA Stewardship Transition Coordination Group (ICG) seeks
   complete formal responses to this RFP from the "operational
   communities" of IANA (i.e., those with direct operational or service
   relationships with the IANA functions operator, in connection with
   names, numbers, or protocol parameters).

   Proposals are expected to enjoy a broad consensus of support from all
   interested parties.  During the development of their proposals, the
   operational communities are requested to consult and work with other
   affected parties.  Likewise, in order to help the ICG maintain its
   light coordination role, all other affected parties are strongly
   encouraged to participate in community processes.

   The following link provides information about ongoing community
   processes and how to participate in them, and that will continue to
   be updated over time:

   https://www.icann.org/en/stewardship/community

   Communities are asked to adhere to open and inclusive processes in
   developing their responses, so that all community members may fully
   participate in and observe those processes.  Communities are also
   asked to actively seek out and encourage wider participation by any
   other parties with interest in their response.

   A major challenge of the ICG will be to identify and help to
   reconcile differences between submitted proposals, in order to
   produce a single plan for the transition of IANA stewardship.
   Submitted Proposals should therefore focus on those elements that are
   considered to be truly essential to the transition of their specific
   IANA functions.

   The target deadline for all complete formal responses to this RFP is
   15 January 2015.

   I.  Comments

   While the ICG is requesting complete formal proposals from the
   operational communities only, and that all interested parties get
   involved as early as possible in the relevant community processes,
   some parties may choose to provide comments directly to the ICG about
   specific aspects of particular proposals, about the community
   processes, or about the ICG's own processes.  Comments may be
   directly submitted to the ICG any time via email to icg-
   forum@icann.org.  Comments will be publicly archived at <http://
   forum.icann.org/lists/icg-forum/>.

   Commenters should be aware that ICG will direct comments received to
   the relevant operational communities if appropriate.  The ICG will
   review comments received as time and resources permit and in
   accordance with the overall timeline for the transition.  That is,
   comments received about specific proposals may not be reviewed until
   those proposals have been submitted to the ICG.  The ICG may
   establish defined public comment periods about specific topics in the
   future, after the complete formal responses to the RFP have been
   received.

   Required Proposal Elements

   The ICG encourages each community to submit a single proposal that
   contains the elements described in this section.

Internet-Draft             IANA ICG Response                October 2014


   Communities are requested to describe the elements delineated in the
   sections below in as much detail possible, and according to the
   suggested format/structure, to allow the ICG to more easily
   assimilate the results.  While each question is narrowly defined to
   allow for comparison between answers, respondents are encouraged to
   provide further information in explanatory sections, including
   descriptive summaries of policies/practices and associated references
   to source documents of specific policies/practices.  In this way, the
   responses to the questionnaire will be useful at the operational
   level as well as to the broader stakeholder communities.

   In the interest of completeness and consistency, proposals should
   cross-reference wherever appropriate the current IANA Functions
   Contract[NTIA-Contract] when describing existing arrangements and
   proposing changes to existing arrangements.

   IETF Response:

   Many IETF protocols make use of commonly defined protocol parameters.
   These parameters are used by implementers, who are the IETF's primary
   users of the IETF standards and other documents.  To ensure
   consistent interpretation of these parameter values by independent

   implementations, and to promote universal interoperability, these
   IETF protocol specifications define and require globally available
   registry containing the parameter values and a pointer to
   documentation of the associated semantic intent.  The IETF uses the
   IANA protocol parameter registries to implement such registries.

   >>>
   >>> A description of the customer(s) of the service or activity.
   >>>


   IETF Response:

   The customer of the IANA protocol parameters function is the Internet
   Engineering Task Force (IETF).

   The IETF is a global voluntary standards organization whose goal is
   to make the Internet work better [RFC3595].  IETF standards are
   published in the RFC series.  The IETF is responsible for the key
   standards that are used on the Internet today, including IP, TCP,
   DNS, BGP, and HTTP, to name but a few.

   The IETF operates an open and transparent manner [RFC6852].  The
   processes that govern the IETF are also published in the RFC series.
   The Internet Standards Process is documented in [RFC2026].  That
   document explains not only how standards are developed, but also how
   disputes about decisions are resolved.  RFC 2026 has been amended a
   number of times, and those amendments are indicated in [RFC-INDEX].
   The standards process can be amended in the same manner that
   standards are approved.  That is, someone proposes a change by
   submitting a temporary document known as an Internet-Draft, the
   community discusses it, and if rough consensus can be found the
   change is approved by the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG),
   who also have day-to-day responsibility for declaring IETF consensus
   on technical decisions, including those that affect IANA.  Anyone may
   propose a change during a Last Call, and anyone may participate in
   the community discussion.

   The protocol parameter registries are the product of IETF work.
   Administration of the protocol parameter registries is the service
   that is provide to the IETF.

   IETF Response:

   It is important to note that the IETF includes anyone who wishes to
   participate, including anyone from ICANN or the regional Internet
   registries (RIRs), and many people from those organizations regularly
   do.

   o  The IETF has specified a number of special use registries with
      regard to domain names.  These registries require coordination
      with the Generic Names Support Organization (GNSO).  We already
      perform this coordination.[RFC6761]

   o  The IETF specifies the DNS protocol.  From time to time there have
      been and will be updates to that protocol.  We will continue to
      coordinate with ICANN regarding those changes.

   o  The IETF specifies minimum requirements for root servers.  Should
      those requirements change, we will inform ICANN.

   o  The routing architecture has evolved over time, and is expected to
      continue to do so.  Such evolution may have an impact on
      appropriate IP address allocation strategies.  As and when that
      happens, we will consult with the RIR community, as we have done
      in the past.

   o  The IETF has established registries with IANA for special IPv4 and
      IPv6 assignments.  These are specified in [RFC6890].  The IETF
      coordinates such assignments with the RIRs.

   o  IETF standards changes may have impact on operations of RIRs and
      service providers.  A recent example is the expansion of the BGP
      community field from 16 to 32 bits.[RFC6793]  It is important to
      note that this change occurred out of operational necessity, and
      it demonstrated strong alignment between the RIRs and the IETF.

   IETF Response:

   Policy for overall management of the registries is stated in RFCs in
   [RFC6220] and [RFC5226].  The first of these documents explains the
   model for how the registries are to be operated, how policy is set,
   and how oversight takes place.  RFC 5226 specifies the policies that
   specification writers may employ when they define new protocol
   registries in the "IANA Considerations" section of each
   specification.  All policies at the IETF begin with a proposal in the
   form of an Internet-Draft.  Anyone may submit such a proposal.  If
   there is sufficient interest, the Internet Engineering Steering Group
   may choose to create a working group or an Area Director may choose
   to sponsor the draft.  In either case, anyone may comment on the
   proposal as it progresses.  A proposal cannot be passed by the IESG
   unless it enjoys sufficient community support as to indicate rough
   consensus [RFC7282]  In each case, a "Last Call" is made so that
   there is notice of any proposed change to a policy or process.
   Anyone may comment during a Last Call.

   IETF Response:

   Most disputes are handled at the lowest level through the working

   action, Section 6.5 of [RFC2026] specifies a multi-level conflict
   resolution and appeals process that includes the responsible Area
   Director, the IESG, and the IAB.  Should appeals be upheld, an
   appropriate remedy is applied.  In the case where an someone claims
   that the procedures themselves are insufficient or inadequate in some
   way to address a circumstance, one may appeal an IAB decision to the
   Internet Society Board of Trustees.

   IETF Response:

   The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) is an oversight body of the
   IETF whose responsibilities include, among other things, confirming
   appointment of IESG members, managing appeals as discussed above,
   management of certain domains, including .ARPA [RFC3172], and general
   architectural guidance to the broader community.  The IAB must
   approve the appointment of an organization to act as IANA on behalf
   of the IETF.  The IAB is also responsible for establishing liaison
   relationships with other orgnaizations on behalf of the IETF.  The
   IAB's charter is to be found in [RFC2850].

   The IAB members are selected and may be recalled through a Nominating
   Committee (NOMCOM) process, which is described in [RFC3777].  This
   process provides for selection of active members of the community who
   themselves agree upon a slate of candidates.  Those candidates are
   sent to the Internet Society Board of Trustees for confirmation.  In
   general, members serve for two years.  The IAB selects its own chair.

   The IAB provides oversight of the protocol parameter registries of
   the IETF, and is responsible for selecting appropriate operator(s)
   and related per-registry arrangements.  Especially when relationships
   among protocols call for it, many registries are operated by, or in
   conjunction with, other bodies.  Unless the IAB or IETF has concluded
   that special treatment is needed, the operator for registries is
   currently ICANN.

   >>> the terms under which the mechanism may change.

   IETF Response:

   A memorandum of understanding (MoU) between ICANN and the IETF
   community has been in place since 2000.  It can be found in
   [RFC2860].  The MoU defines the work to be carried out by the IANA
   staff for the IETF and the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF), a
   peer organization to the IETF that focuses on research.  Each year a
   service level agreement is negotiated that supplements the MoU.

   Day-to-day administration and contract management is the
   responsibility of the IETF Administrative Director (IAD).  The IETF
   Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) oversees the IAD.  IAOC
   members are appointed by the Internet Society Board of Trustees, the
   IAB, the IESG, and the NOMCOM [RFC4071].  The IAOC works with ICANN
   to establish annual IANA performance metrics and operational
   procedures, and the resulting document is adopted as an supplement to
   the MoU each year [MOUSUP].

   To date there have been no unresolvable disputes or issues.  In the
   unlikely event that a more difficult situation should arise, the IAOC
   and the IAB would engage ICANN management to address the matter.  The
   MoU also provides an option for either party to terminate the
   arrangement with six months notice.  Obviously such action would only
   be undertaken after serious consideration.

   IETF Response:

   No changes are required, as over the years since the creation of
   ICANN, the IETF, ICANN, and IAB have together created a system of
   agreements, policies, and oversight mechanisms that covers what is
   needed.

   First and foremost, IANA protocol parameter registry updates will
   continue to function day-to-day, as they have been doing for the last
   decade or more.  The IETF community is quite satisfied with the
   current arrangement with ICANN.  RFC 2860 remains in force and has
   served the IETF community very well.  RFC 6220 has laid out an
   appropriate service description and requirements.

   Discussions during IETF 89 in London led to the following guiding
   principles for IAB efforts that impact IANA protocol parameter
   registries.  These principles must be taken together; their order is
   not significant.

   1.  The IETF protocol parameter registry function has been and
   continues to be capably provided by the Internet technical community.

   The strength and stability of the function and its foundation within
   the Internet technical community are both important given how
   critical protocol parameters are to the proper functioning of IETF
   protocols.

   We think the structures that sustain the protocol parameter registry
   function needs to be strong enough that they can be offered
   independently by the Internet technical community, without the need
   for backing from external parties.  And we believe we largely are
   there already, although the system can be strengthened further, and
   continuous improvements are being made.

   2.  The protocol parameter registry function requires openness,
   transparency, and accountability.

   Existing documentation of how the function is administered and
   overseen is good [RFC2860], [RFC6220].  Further articulation and
   clarity may be beneficial.  It is important that the whole Internet
   community can understand how the function works, and that the
   processes for registering parameters and holding those who oversee
   the protocol parameter function accountable for following those
   processes are understood by all interested parties.  We are committed
   to making improvements here if necessary.

   3.  Any contemplated changes to the protocol parameter registry
   function should respect existing Internet community agreements.

   The protocol parameter registry is working well.  The existing
   Memorandum of Understanding in RFC 2860 defines "the technical work
   to be carried out by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority on
   behalf of the Internet Engineering Task Force and the Internet
   Research Task Force."  Any modifications to the protocol parameter
   registry function should be made using the IETF process to update RFC
   6220 and other relevant RFCs.  Put quite simply: evolution, not
   revolution.

   4.  The Internet architecture requires and receives capable service
   by Internet registries.

   The stability of the Internet depends on capable provision of not
   just IETF protocol parameters, but IP numbers, domain names, and
   other registries.  Furthermore, DNS and IPv4/IPv6 are IETF-defined
   protocols.  Thus we expect the role of the IETF in standards
   development, architectural guidance, and allocation of certain name/
   number parameters to continue.  IP multicast addresses and special-
   use DNS names are two examples where close coordination is needed.
   The IETF will continue to coordinate with ICANN, the RIRs, and other
   parties that are mutually invested in the continued smooth operation
   of the Internet registries.  We fully understand the need to work
   together.

   5.  The IETF will continue management of the protocol parameter
   registry function as an integral component of the IETF standards
   process and the use of resulting protocols.

   RFC 6220 specifies the role and function of the protocol parameters
   registry, which is critical to IETF standards processes and IETF
   protocols.  The IAB, on behalf of the IETF, has the responsibility to
   define and manage the relationship with the protocol registry
   operator role.  This responsibility includes the selection and

   management of the protocol parameter registry operator, as well as
   management of the parameter registration process and the guidelines
   for parameter allocation.

   6.  The protocol parameters registries are provided as a public
   service.

   Directions for the creation of protocol parameter registries and the
   policies for subsequent additions and updates are specified in RFCs.
   The protocol parameters registries are available to everyone, and
   they are published in a form that allows their contents to be
   included in other works without further permission.  These works
   include, but are not limited to, implementations of Internet
   protocols and their associated documentation.

   These principles will guide the IAB, IAOC, and the rest of the IETF
   community as they work with ICANN to establish future IANA
   performance metrics and operational procedures.

   IETF Response:

   No structural changes are required.  The principles listed above will
   guide IAB, IAOC, and the rest of the IETF community as they work with
   ICANN to establish future IANA performance metrics and operational
   procedures, as they have in the past.

   As no services are expected to change, no continuity issuees are
   anticipated, and there are no new technical or operational methods
   proposed by the IETF to test.  The IETF leadership, ICANN, and the
   RIRs maintain an ongoing informal dialog to spot any unforeseen
   issues that might arise as a result of other changes.

   IETF Response:

   Everyone is welcome to participate in IETF activities.  The policies
   and procedures are outlined in the documents we named above.  In-
   person attendance is not required for participation, and many people
   participate in email discussions that have never attended an IETF
   meeting.  An email account is the only requirement to participate.
   The IETF makes use of both formal and informal lines of communication
   to collaborate with other organizations within the multistakeholder
   ecosystem.

   IETF Response:

   The DNS relies on some of the IETF protocol parameters registries.
   As the current IANA functions operator, ICANN performs its task very
   well, usually exceeding the service level agreement metrics.[METRICS]
   Security, stability, and resiliency of the Internet DNS is best
   protected by maintaining the current service in its current form.

   Implementers and their users from around the world make use of the
   IETF standards and the associated IANA protocol parameter registries.
   The current IANA protocol parameter registry system is meeting the
   needs of these global customers.  This proposal continues to meet
   their needs by maintaining the existing processes that have served
   them well in the past.

   >>>
   >>> "Maintain the openness of the Internet."

   IETF Response:

   This proposal maintains the existing open framework that allows
   anyone to participate in the development of IETF standards, including
   the IANA protocol parameter registry policies.  Further, an
   implementer anywhere in the world has full access to the protocol
   specification published n the RFC series and the protocol parameter
   registries published at iana.org.  Those who require assignments in
   the IANA protocol registries will continue to be able to do so, as
   specified by the existing policies for those registries.

   {We will have an open discussion, make changes based on that
   discussion, and then conduct a Last Call to confirm that there is
   rough consensus for the proposal.}

   The IESG established the IANAPLAN working group to develop this
   response.  Anyone was welcome to join the discussion and participate
   in the development of this response.  An open mailing list
   (ianaplan@ietf.org) was associated with the working group.  In
   addition, IETF's IANA practices have been discussed in the broader

3.  IANA Considerations

   This memo is a response a request for proposals.  No parameter
   allocations or changes are sought.

   While the IANA framework has shown strong resiliency, the IETF will
   continue to work with all relevant parties to facilitate improvements
   in our standards.

   This document does not define new processes, and so it seems we
   acknowledge all of the preceding IAB members and members of the
   community who developed the processes that we describe.  The initial
   version of this document was developed collaboratively through both
