                   Extending YANG with Revised Types
                     draft-chen-netmod-yang-ext-00

Abstract

   YANG - the NETCONF Data Modeling Language - supports modeling of a
   tree of data elements that represent the configuration and runtime
   status of a particular network element managed via NETCONF.  This
   document introduces new idea which revises the ID
   [draft-linowski-netmod-yang-abstract-03] and clears some ambiguous
   concepts and descrptions.

1.  Introduction

   [draft-linowski-netmod-yang-abstract-03] suggests to enhance YANG
   with supplementary modeling features and language abstractions with
   the aim to improve the model extensibility and reuse.

   However, some ideas and description are not defined clearly,this memo
   tries to amend the concepts and gives some suggestions.

1.1.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Redefing type in YANG abstract

   section "2.3. instance extension statement" and "2.4. instance-list
   extension statement", the table of substatement list out that "type"
   is allowed, but "instance-type" is not listed. so it is conflict with
   what is wrote in section 3.2. instance-type extension statement.
   suggest that "instance-type" is need not defined, use "type" instead,
   and give description in section 2.3 and 2.4


3.  Revised types in yang-abstract

3.1.  Removing confusion

   There exists difference between types of a list and types of the node
   of the list,and both types are being used in application
   implementation.  But in YANG and yang-abstract, it is not
   distinguished.  It will cause confusion in complehension and
   implementation .  So it is strongly suggested do not introduce
   subtree/subtype/field in list definition, that is in
   "draft-linowski-netmod-yang-abstract-03.txt" , section "2.4.
   instance-list extension statement" remove choice ,
   container,instance,instance-list,leaf ,leaf-list,list in substatment
   table, only "type" for use a complex-type is allowed.
