   The following additional errors may be returned instead of the _Foo/
   queryChanges_ response:

   "tooManyChanges": There are more changes than the client's
   _maxChanges_ argument.  Each item in the removed or added array is
   considered as one change.  The client may retry with a higher max
   changes or invalidate its cache of the query results.

   "cannotCalculateChanges": The server cannot calculate the changes
   from the queryState string given by the client.  Usually due to the
   client's state being too old.  The client MUST invalidate its cache
   of the query results.
