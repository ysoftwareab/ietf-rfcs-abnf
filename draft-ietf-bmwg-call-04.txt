Abstract

   This  memo  discusses  and  defines  terms  associated  with performance
   benchmarking tests and the results of these  tests  in  the  context  of
   cell- based and call-based switching devices.  The terms defined in this
   memo will be used in addition to terms defined in RFCs  1242,  1944  and
   2285.   This  memo  is a product of the Benchmarking Methodology Working
   Group (BMWG) of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).


1. Introduction.

   This document provides terminology for benchmarking cell-based and call-
   based  switching  devices.   It  extends terminology already defined for
   benchmarking network interconnect devices in RFC's 1242, 1944 and  2285.
   Although  some  of  the  definitions in this memo may be applicable to a
   broader group of network interconnect devices, the primary focus of  the
   terminology  in  this  memo  is  on  cell-based and call-based switches.
   Specifically, this includes Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) cell  relay
   and signaling.

INTERNET-DRAFT       Call/Cell Benchmarking Terminology       February 1999


   This  memo  contains  two  major  sections:  Background and Definitions.
   Within the definitions  section  is  a  formal  definitions  subsection,
   provided as a courtesy to the reader, and a measurement definitions sub-
   section, which contains performance metrics with  inherent  units.   The
   divisions of the measurement sub-section follow the BISDN model.

   The  BISDN  model  comprises  four layers and two planes.  This document
   addresses the interactions between these layers and how they effect  the
   performance of IP, TCP, etc.  A schematic of the model follows:


                    User Plane         |           Control Plane
   Services |                          |   ILMI    |       UNI, PNNI
   ---------|--------------------------|-----------|---------------------
   AAL      |AAL1, AAL2, AAL3/4, AAL5  |   AAL5    |          SAAL
   ---------|--------------------------|-----------|---------------------
   ATM      |        Cell Relay        |               OAM, RM
   ---------|--------------------------|---------------------------------
            |       Convergence        |
   Physical |--------------------------|---------------------------------
            |          Media           |
   ---------|--------------------------|---------------------------------



   This document assumes that necessary services are available and
   active.

   For example, IP connectivity requires SSCOP connectivity between
   signaling entities.  Further, it is assumed that the SUT has the
   ability to configure ATM addresses (via hard coded addresses, ILMI
   or PNNI neighbor discovery), has the ability to run SSCOP, and has
   the ability to perform signaled call setups (via UNI or PNNI
   signaling).  Finally, this document presents only the terminology
   associated with benchmarking IP performance over ATM; therefore,
   it does not represent a total compilation of ATM test terminology.

   The BMWG produces two major classes of documents: Benchmarking
   Terminology documents and Benchmarking Methodology documents.  The
   Terminology documents present the benchmarks and other related
   terms.  The Methodology documents define the procedures required
   to collect the benchmarks cited in the corresponding Terminology
   documents.

   2. Existing Definitions

   RFC 1242 "Benchmarking Terminology for Network Interconnect Devices"
   should be consulted before attempting to make use of this document.  RFC

INTERNET-DRAFT       Call/Cell Benchmarking Terminology       February 1999


   1944 "Benchmarking Methodology for Network Interconnect Devices" contains
   discussions of a number of terms relevant to the benchmarking of switching
   devices and should also be consulted.  RFC 2285 "Benchmarking Terminology
   for LAN Switching Devices" contains a number of terms pertaining to
   traffic distributions and datagram interarrival.  For the sake of clarity
   and continuity this RFC adopts the template for definitions set out in
   Section 2 of RFC 1242.  Definitions are indexed and grouped together in
   sections for ease of reference.  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT",
   "REQUIRED", "SHALL, "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",
   "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" go in this document are to be interpreted as
   described in RFC 2119.


   II. Definitions

   The definitions presented in this section have been divided into two
   groups.  The first group is formal definitions, which are required in the
   definitions of the performance metrics but are not themselves strictly
   metrics.  These definitions are subsumed from other work done in other
   working groups both inside and outside the IETF.  They are provided as a
   courtesy to the reader.

   Formal Definitions

   1.1. Definition Format (from RFC 1242)

   Term to be defined.

   Definition: The specific definition for the term.

   Discussion: A brief discussion of the term, its application and any
   restrictions on measurement procedures.

   Specification: The working group and document in which the term is
   specified. Listed in the references.


   1.2.      Related Definitions.

   1.2. 1. Allowed Cell Rate (ACR):

   Definition: An ABR service parameter, ACR is the current rate
   (cells/second) at which a source is allowed to send.

   Discussion:  For ABR traffic, ACR constitutes the actual data throughput
   for a particular VC.  The time change of this value effects TCP round trip
   time calculations, which in turn effects TCP throughput.

INTERNET-DRAFT       Call/Cell Benchmarking Terminology       February 1999


   Specification: AF-TM4.0

   1.2.2. ACR Decrease Time Factor (ADTF):

   Definition: This is the time permitted between sending RM-cells before the
   rate is decreased to ICR (Initial Cell Rate). The time units are
             .01 to 10.23 seconds
   with a granularity of 10 ms.

   Discussion: For ABR traffic, ADTF constitutes the time rate of the ACR.
   This value effects TCP round trip time calculations, which in turn effects
   TCP throughput.

   Specification: AF-TM4.0

   1.2.3. Additive Increase Rate (AIR):

   Definition: An ABR service parameter, AIR controls the rate at which the
   cell transmission rate increases. It is signaled as AIRF, where
             AIRF = AIR*Nrm/PCR.

   Discussion: For ABR traffic, AIR effects the time rate of change of the
   ACR. This value effects TCP round trip time calculations, which in turn
   effects TCP throughput.

   Specification: AF-TM4.0

   1.2.4. Additive Increase Rate Factor (AIRF):

   Definition: Refer to AIR.

   Discussion: Refer to AIR.

   Specification: AF-TM4.0

   1.2.5. ATM Adaptation Layer (AAL):

   Definition: The layer in the B-ISDN reference model (see B-ISDN) which
   adapts higher layer PDU's into the ATM layer.

   Discussion: There are 4 types of adaptation layers:
   AAL 1: used for circuit emulation, voice over ATM
   AAL2: used for sub-rated voice over ATM
   AAL3/4: used for data over noisy ATM lines
        AAL5: used for data over ATM, most widely used AAL type
   These AAL types are not measurements, but it is possible to measure the
   time required for Segmentation and Reassembly (SAR).

INTERNET-DRAFT       Call/Cell Benchmarking Terminology       February 1999


   Specification: AF-TM3.1

   1.2.6. ATM Adaptation Layer Type 5 (AAL5):

   Definition: AAL5 functions in support of variable bit rate, delay-tolerant
   data traffic requiring minimal sequencing or error detection support.

   Discussion: AAL5 is the adaptation layer for UNI signaling, ILMI, PNNI
   signaling, and for IP PDU'S. It is the most widely used AAL type to date.

   Specification: AF-UNI3.1

   1.2.7. Available Bit Rate (ABR):

   Definition: ABR is an ATM layer service category for which the limiting
   ATM layer transfer characteristics provided by the network may change
   subsequent to connection establishment. A flow control mechanism is
   specified which supports several types of feedback to control the source
   rate in response to changing ATM layer transfer characteristics.

   Discussion: It is expected that an end-system that adapts its traffic in
   accordance with the feedback will experience a low cell loss ratio and
   obtain a fair share of the available bandwidth according to a network
   specific allocation policy. Cell delay variation is not controlled in this
   service, although admitted cells are not delayed unnecessarily.

   Specification: AF-TM4.0

   1.2.8. Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)

   Definition: A transfer mode in which the information is organized into 53
   octet PDUs called cells. It is asynchronous in the sense that the
   recurrence of cells containing information from an individual user is not
   necessarily periodic.

   Discussion: ATM is based on the ISDN model.

   Specification: AF-UM3.1

   1.2.9. ATM Link:

   Definition: A virtual path link (VPL) or a virtual channel link (VCL).

   intrinsic traffic characteristics of a requested ATM connection. See GCRA
   and ABR.

   Discussion: none.

   Specification: AF-UNI3.1

   1.2.12. ATM User-User Connection:

   Definition: An association established by the ATM Layer to support
   communication between two or more ATM service users (i.e., between two or
   more next higher entities or between two or more ATM-entities). The
   communications over an ATM Layer connection may be either bi-directional
   or unidirectional. The same Virtual Channel Identifier (VCI) issued for
   both directions of a connection at an interface.

   Discussion: none.

   Specification: AF-UNI3.1

   1.2.13. Backward Explicit Congestion Notification (BECN):

   Definition: A Resource Management (RM) cell type generated by the network
   or the destination, indicating congestion or approaching congestion for
   traffic flowing in the direction opposite that of the BECN cell.

   Discussion:  none.

   Specification: AF-TM4.0

   1.2.14. BECN Cell (BN):

   Definition: A Resource Management (RM) cell type indicator. The network or
   the destination may generate a Backwards Explicit Congestion Notification

   generated, and DIR=1 to indicate the backward flow. Source generated RM-
   cells are initialized with BN=O.

   Discussion: none.

   Specification: AF-TM4.0

   1.2.15. Broadband ISDN (B-ISDN) Model:

   Definition: A layered service model that specifies the mapping of higher
   layer protocols onto ATM and its underlying physical layer. The model is
   composed of four layers: Physical, ATM, AAL and Service.

   Discussion: none.

   Specification: AF-UNI3.1

   1.2.16. Burst Tolerance (BT):

   Definition: A traffic parameter, which, along with the Sustainable Cell
   Rate (SCR), specifies the maximum number of cells which will be accepted
   at the Peak Cell Rate (PCR) on an ATM connection.

   Discussion: BT applies to ATM connections supporting VBR services and is
   the limit parameter of the GCRA.

   Specification: AF-TM4.0

   1.2.17. Connection Admission Control (CAC):

   Definition: Connection Admission Control is defined as the set of actions
   taken by the network during the call set-up phase (or during call re-
   negotiation phase) in order to determine whether a connection request can
   be accepted or should be rejected (or whether a request for re-allocation

   can be accommodated).

   Discussion: none

   Specification: AF-UNI3.1

   1.2.18. Call:

   Definition: A call is an association between two or more users or between
   a user and a network entity that is established by the use of network
   capabilities. This association may have zero or more connections.

   Discussion: none

   Specification: AF-UNI3.1

   1.2.19. Call-based:

   Definition: A transport requiring call setups- see CALL definition.

   Discussion: none

   Specification: AF-UNI3.1

   1.2.20. Constant Bit Rate (CBR):

   Definition: An ATM service category which supports a constant or
   guaranteed rate to transport services such as video or voice as well as
   circuit emulation which requires rigorous timing control and performance
   parameters.

   Discussion: CBR reduces problems associated with TCP performance and
   throughput. **

   Specification: AF-UNI3.1

   1.2.21. Cell:

   Definition: A unit of transmission in ATM. A fixed-size frame consisting
   of a 5-octet header and a 48-octet payload.

   Discussion: none.

   Specification: AF-UNI3.1

   1.2.22. Cell Header:

   Definition: ATM Layer protocol control information.

   Discussion: The ATM cell header is a 5-byte header that contains the
   following fields:
   Generic Flow Control (GFC): 4 bits
   Virtual Path Identifier (VPI): 8 bits
   Virtual Channel Identifier (VCI): 16 bits
   Payload Type (PT): 3 bits
   Cell Loss Priority (CLP): 1 bit
   Header Error Check (HEC): 8 bit CRC computed over the previous 4 octets

   Each field is discussed in this document.

   Specification: AF-UNI3.1

Dunn & Martin                                                      [Page 8]

INTERNET-DRAFT       Call/Cell Benchmarking Terminology       February 1999


   Definition: This is a field in a RM-cell, and is used to cause the source
   to decrease its ACR. The source sets CI=O when it sends a RM-cell.
   Setting CI=1 is typically how destinations indicate that Explicit Forward
   Congestion Indication (EFCI) has been received on a previous data cell.

   Discussion: none.

   Specification: AF-TM4.0

   1.2.24. Cell Loss Priority (CLP):

   Definition: This bit in the ATM cell header indicates two levels of
   priority for ATM cells. CLP=0 cells are higher priority than CLP=1 cells.
   CLP=1 cells may be discarded during periods of congestion to preserve the
   CLR of CLP=0 cells.

   Discussion: The CLP bit is used to determine GCRA contract compliance.

   Specification: AF-UNI3.1

   1.2.25. Connection:

   Definition: An ATM connection consists of concatenation of ATM Layer links
   in order to provide an end-to-end information transfer capability to
   access points.

   Discussion: none.

   Specification: AF-UNI3.1

   1.2.26. Cutoff Decrease Factor (CDF):

   Definition: CDF controls the decrease in ACR (Allowed Cell Rate)
   associated with CRM (missing RM cell count).

   Discussion: For ABR traffic, CDF effects the time rate of change of the
   ACR. This value effects TCP round trip time calculations, which in turn
   effects TCP throughput.

   Specification: AF-TM4.0

   1.2.27. Current Cell Rate (CCR):

   Definition: The Current Cell Rate is an RM-cell field set by the source to
   its current ACR when it generates a forward RM-cell. This field may be
   used to facilitate the calculation of ER, and may not be changed by
   network elements. CCR is formatted as a rate.

INTERNET-DRAFT       Call/Cell Benchmarking Terminology       February 1999


   Discussion: See actual cell rate.

   Specification: AF-TM4.0

   1.2.28. Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC):

   Definition: A mathematical algorithm that computes a numerical value based
   on the bits in a block of data. This number is transmitted with the data
   and the receiver uses this information and the same algorithm to insure
   the accurate delivery of data by comparing the results of algorithm and
   the number received. If a mismatch occurs, an error in transmission is
   presumed.

   Discussion: CRC is not a measurement, but it is possible to measure the
   amount of time to perform a CRC on a string of bits. This measurement will
   not be addressed in this document.

   Specification: AF-UNI3.1

   1.2.29. DIR:

   Definition: This is a field in a RM-cell, which indicates the direction of
   the RM-cell with respect to the data flow with which it is associated.
   The source sets DIR=O and the destination sets DIR=1.

   Discussion: none

   Specification: AF-TM4.0

   1.2.30. Explicit Forward Congestion Indication (EFCI):

   Definition: EFCI is an indication in the PTI field of the ATM cell header.
   A network element in an impending-congested state or a congested state may
   set EFCI so that this indication may be examined by the destination end-
   system. For example, the end-system may use this indication to implement a
   protocol that adoptively lowers the cell rate of the connection during
   congestion or impending congestion. A network element that is not in a
   congestion state or an impending congestion state will not modify the
   value of this indication. Impending congestion is the state when network
   equipment is operating around its engineered capacity level.

   Discussion: none.

   Specification: AF-TM4.0

   1.2.3 1. Explicit Rate (ER):

   Definition: The Explicit Rate is a RM-cell field used to limit the source



Dunn & Martin                                                     [Page 10]

INTERNET-DRAFT       Call/Cell Benchmarking Terminology       February 1999


   ACR to a specific value. It is initially set by the source to a requested
   rate (such as PCR). It may be subsequently reduced by any network element
   in the path to a value that the element can sustain. ER is formatted as a
   rate.

   Discussion: For ABR traffic, ER effects the ACR. This value effects TCP
   round trip time calculations, which in turn effects TCP throughput.

   Specification: AF-TM4.0

   1.2.32. End System (ES):

   Definition: A system where an ATM connection is terminated or initiated.
   An originating end system initiates the ATM connection, and terminating
   end system terminates the ATM connection. OAM cells may be generated and
   received.

   Discussion: An ES can be the user side of a UNI signaling interface.

   Specification: AF-TEST-0022

   1.2.33. Generic Cell Rate Algorithm (GCRA):

   Definition: The GCRA is used to define conformance with respect to the
   traffic contract of the connection. For each cell arrival the GCRA
   determines whether the cell conforms to the traffic contract. The UPC
   function may implement the GCRA, or one or more equivalent algorithms to
   enforce conformance. The GCRA is defined with two parameters: the
   Increment (1) and the Limit (L).

   Discussion: GCRA is not a measurement, but there are a number of
   measurements that can be obtained using the GCRA and other parameters.

   Specification: AF-TM4.0

   1.2.34. Generic Flow Control (GFC):

   Definition: GFC is a field in the ATM header, which can be used to provide
   local functions (e.g., flow control). It has local significance only and
   the value encoded in the field is not carried end-to-end.

   Discussion: none

   Specification: AF-UNI3.1

   1.2.35. Header Error Control (HEC):

   Definition: A check character calculated using an 8 bit CRC computed over

   the first 4 octets of the ATM cell header. This allows for single bit
   error correction or multiple bit error detection.

   Discussion: none

   Specification: AF-UNI3.1

   1.2.36. Initial Cell Rate (ICR):

   Definition: An ABR service parameter, in cells/sec, that is the rate at
   which a source should send initially and after an idle period.

   Discussion: none

   Specification: AF-TM4.0

   1.2.37. Integrated Local Management Interface

   Definition: A management protocol which uses SNMPv1 carried on AAL5 to
   provide ATM network devices with status and configuration information
   concerning VPC's, VCC's, registered ATM addresses and the capabilities of
   ATM interfaces.

   Discussion: ILMI is a conditionally required portion of UNI3.1; however,
   ILMI 4.0 has been issued as a separate specification.  This document will
   refer to ILMI 4.0.

   Specification: AF-ILMI4.0

   1.2.38. Intermediate System (IS):

   Definition: A system that provides forwarding functions or relaying
   functions or both for a specific ATM connection. OAM cells may be
   generated and received.

   Discussion: An IS can be either the user or network side of a UNI
   signaling interface, or the network side of a PNNI signaling interface.

   Specification: AF-TEST-0022

   1.2.39. Leaky Bucket (LB):

   Definition: Leaky Bucket is the term used as an analogous description of
   the algorithm used for conformance checking of cell flows from a user or
   network. See GCRA and UPC.  The "leaking hole in the bucket" applies to
   the sustained rate at which cells can be accommodated, while the "bucket
   depth" applies to the tolerance to cell bursting over a given time period.

INTERNET-DRAFT       Call/Cell Benchmarking Terminology       February 1999


   Discussion: There are two types of LB algorithms- single and dual. Single
   LB defines a PCR; dual LB defines a PCR and SCR.

   Specification: AF-TM4.0

   1.2-40. Maximum Cell Rate (MCR):

   Definition: This is the maximum capacity usable by connections belonging
   to the specified service category.

   Discussion: none

   Specification: AF-TM4.0

   1.2.41. Maximum Burst Size (MBS):

   Definition: In the signaling message, the Burst Tolerance (BT) is conveyed
   through the MBS that is coded as a number of cells. The BT together with
   the SCR and the GCRA determine the MBS that may be transmitted at the peak
   rate and still is in conformance with the GCRA.

   Discussion: none

   Specification: AF-TM4.0

   1.2.42. Minimum Cell Rate (MCR):

   Definition: An ABR service traffic descriptor, in cells/sec, that is the
   rate at which the source is always allowed to send.

   Discussion: none

   Specification: AF-TM4.0

   1.2.43. Missing RM-Cell Count (CRM):

   Definition: CRM limits the number of forward RM-cells that may be sent in
   the absence of received backward RM-cells.

   Discussion: none.

   Specification: AF-TM4.0

   1.2.44. Mrm:

   Definition: An ABR service parameter that controls allocation of bandwidth
   between forward W-cells, backward RM-cells, and data cells.

   Specification: AF-TM4.0

   1.2.60. Switched Virtual Circuit (SVC):

   Definition: A connection established via signaling. The user defines the
   endpoints when the call is initiated.

   Discussion: SVC's are established using either UNI signaling or PNNI
   signaling.  The signaling state machine implements several timers, which
   can effect the time required for call establishment.  This will, in turn,
   effect TCP round trip time calculation, effecting TCP throughput.

   Definition: A sub-layer of the physical layer of the B-ISDN model
   transforms the flow of cells into a steady flow of bits and bytes for
   transmission over the physical medium. On transmit the TC sublayer maps
   the cells to the frame format, generates the Header Error Check (HEC), and
   sends idle cells when the ATM layer has none to send. On reception, the TC
   sublayer delineates individual cells in the received bit stream, and uses
   the HEC to detect and correct received errors.

   Discussion: TC is not a measurement, but the speed in which TC can occur

   Definition: An ABR service parameter, TOF controls the maximum time
   permitted between sending forward RM-cells before a rate decrease is
   required. It is signaled as TOFF where TOF=TOFF+1.  TOFF is a power of 2
   in the range: 1/8 to 4,096.

   Discussion: For ABR traffic, TOF effects the time rate of change of the
   ACR. This value effects TCP round trip time calculations, which in turn
   effects TCP throughput.

   Definition: Refer to TOF.

   Discussion: none

   Specification: AF-TM4.0

   1.2.72. Trm.

   time between forward RM-cells for an active source. It is 100 times a
   power of two with a range of 100*2-7 to 100*20

   Discussion: For ABR traffic, Trm effects the time rate of change of the

   conformance at a subsequent interface. Traffic shaping must maintain cell
   sequence integrity on a connection. Shaping modifies traffic
   characteristics of a cell flow with the consequence of increasing the mean
   Cell Transfer Delay.

   Discussion: TS should improve TCP throughput by reducing round trip time
   variations.

   Specification: AF-UNI3.1

   1.2.74. Unspecified Bit Rate (UBR):

   Definition: UBR is an ATM service category, which does not specify traffic
   related service guarantees. Specifically, UBR does not include the notion
   of a per-connection-negotiated bandwidth.  No commitments are made with
   respect to the cell loss ratio experienced by a UBR connection, or as to
   the cell transfer delay experienced by cells on the connection.

   Discussion: RFC 2331 specifies UBR service class for IP over ATM.  UBR
   service models the best effort service type specified in RFC 791;
   however, UBR has specific drawbacks with respect to TCP service.  Since
   UBR makes no guarantee with respect to cell loss, cell delay variation or
   cell mis-insertion, TCP round trip time estimates may not be accurate.

   Specification: AF-TM4.0

   1.2.75. User-Network Interface (UNI):

   Definition: An interface point between ATM end users and a private ATM
   switch, or between a private ATM switch and the public carrier ATM

   1.2.76. Usage Parameter Control (UPC):

   Definition: Usage Parameter Control is defined as the set of actions taken
   by the network to monitor and control traffic, in terms of traffic offered
   and validity of the ATM connection, at the end-system access. Its main
   purpose is to protect network resources from malicious as well as
   unintentional misbehavior, which can affect the QoS of other already
   established connections, by detecting violations of negotiated parameters
   and taking appropriate actions.

   an ABR source endpoint. Backward RM-cells received by a virtual source are
   removed from the connection.  Each ABR control segment, except the last,
   is terminated by a virtual destination. A virtual destination assumes the
   behavior of an ABR destination endpoint. Forward RM-cells received by a

   Definition: SONET Path Overhead Error Count is the number of SONET path
   overhead errors detected.

   2.2.2. ATM Layer

   2.2.2.1. Cell Delay Variation (CDV):

   Definition: The variation in cell transfer delay associated with a given
   traffic load, orientation and distribution, as well as an integration
   period. CDV = max (CTD) - min (CTD) where max and min indicate the maximum
   and minimum over the integration period, respectively.

   Discussion:
   CDV is a component of cell transfer delay, induced by buffering and cell
   scheduling. Peak-to-peak CDV is a QoS delay parameter associated with CBR
   and VBR services. The peak-to-peak CDV is the ((1-a) quantile of the CTD)
   minus the fixed CTD that could be experienced by any delivered cell on a
   connection during the entire connection holding time. The parameter "a" is
   the probability of a cell arriving late.

   CDV effects TCP round trip time calculations.  Large values of CDV will
   adversely effect TCP throughput.

   Measurement Units: seconds

   2.2.2.2. Cell Delay Variation Tolerance (CDVT):

   Definition: ATM layer functions may alter the traffic characteristics of
   ATM connections by introducing Cell Delay Variation. When cells from two
   or more ATM connections are multiplexed, cells of a given ATM connection
   may be delayed while cells of another ATM connection are being inserted at
   the output of the multiplexer. Similarly, some cells may be delayed while
   physical layer overhead or OAM cells are inserted. Consequently, some
   randomness may affect the inter-arrival time between consecutive cells of

   a connection as monitored at the UNI. The upper bound on the "clumping"
   measure is the CDVT.

   the total cells sent in a transmission associated with a given traffic
   load, orientation and distribution, as well as an integration period.
             CER = Errored Cells / Total Cells Transmitted.

   Discussion: The measurement is taken over a time interval and is desirable
   to be measured on an in-service circuit.

   CER causes ATM cells to be lost.  These cells may contain AAL5 segments of
   IP datagrams.

   Measurement Units: dimensionless.

   2.2.2.4. Cell Loss Ratio (CLR):

   Definition: The ratio of lost cells in a transmission in relation to the
   total cells sent in a transmission associated with a given traffic load,
   orientation and distribution, as well as an integration period. CLR
             Lost Cells / Total Cells Transmitted.

   Discussion:
   CLR is a negotiated QoS parameter and acceptable values are network
   specific. The objective is to minimize CLR provided the end-system adapts
   the traffic to the changing ATM layer transfer characteristics. The CLR
   parameter is the value of CLR that the network agrees to offer as an
   objective over the lifetime of the connection. It is expressed as an order
   of magnitude, having a range of 10-1 to 10-15 and unspecified.

   CLR measures the number of ATM cells lost.  These cells may contain AAL5
   segments of IP datagrams.

   of cells properly transmitted associated with a given traffic load,
   orientation and distribution, as well as an integration period. CMR=Mis-
   inserted Cells / Total Cells Transmitted.

   CMR causes ATM streams to be corrupted.  These streams may contain AAL5
   segments of IP datagrams.

   an invalid CRC in relation to the total number of cells properly
   transmitted associated with a given traffic load, orientation and
   distribution, as well as an integration period.

   Discussion:
   CRC errors cause ATM cells to be lost.  These cells may contain AAL5
   segments of IP datagrams.

   Measurement Units: dimensionless

   2.2.2.8. Cell Transfer Delay (CTD):

   Definition: The elapsed time between a cell exit event at the measurement
   point 1 (e.g., at the source UNI) and the corresponding cell entry event
   at a measurement point 2 (e.g., the destination UNI) for a particular
   connection.

   Discussion:
   The cell transfer delay between two measurement points is the sum of the
   total inter-ATM node transmission delay and the total ATM node processing
   delay.

   Measurement units: seconds

   AAL5 PDU to be corrupted.

   Discussion:
   AAL5 Reassembly errors cause AAL5 PDUs to be lost.  These PDUs may
   contain IP datagrams.

   Measurement Units: Positive Integer

   2.2.3.2. AAL5 Reassembly Time

   Definition: AAL5 Reassembly Time constitutes the time between the arrival
   of the final cell in the AAL5 PDU and the AAL5 PDU being made available to
   the service layer.

   Discussion:
   AAL5 Reassembly time directly effects TCP round trip time calculations.

   Measurement Units: seconds

   2.2.3.3. AAL5 CRC Error Ratio:

   Definition: The ratio of PDUs received at an endpoint that which contain
   an invalid CRC in relation to the total number of cells properly
   transmitted associated with a given traffic load, orientation and
   distribution, as well as an integration period.

   Discussion:
   AAL5 CRC errors causes AAL5 PDUs to be dropped. These PDUs may contain
   IP datagrams.

   Measurement Units: dimensionless
