Abstract

   This document defines a new BGP attribute, Traffic Engineering
   attribute, than enables BGP to carry Traffic Engineering information.


1. Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].









2. Traffic Engineering Attribute

   In certain cases (e.g., L1VPN [L1VPN]) it may be useful to augment
   reachability information carried in BGP with the Traffic Engineering
   information.

   This document defines a new BGP attribute, Traffic Engineering
   attribute, than enables BGP [BGP-4] to carry Traffic Engineering
   information.

   Traffic Engineering attribute is an optional non-transitive
   attribute.

   The information carried in this attribute is identical to what is
   carried in the Interface Switching Capability Descriptor, as
   specified in [RFC4203], [RFC4205].

   The attribute contains one or more of the following:

       0                   1                   2                   3

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                  Max LSP Bandwidth at priority 7              |

      |        Switching Capability-specific information              |
      |                  (variable)                                   |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The Switching Capability (Switching Cap) field contains one of the
   following values:

         1     Packet-Switch Capable-1 (PSC-1)
         2     Packet-Switch Capable-2 (PSC-2)
         3     Packet-Switch Capable-3 (PSC-3)
         4     Packet-Switch Capable-4 (PSC-4)
         51    Layer-2 Switch Capable  (L2SC)
         100   Time-Division-Multiplex Capable (TDM)
         150   Lambda-Switch Capable   (LSC)
         200   Fiber-Switch Capable    (FSC)

   The Encoding field contains one of the values specified in Section
   3.1.1 of [GMPLS-SIG].

   Maximum LSP Bandwidth is encoded as a list of eight 4 octet fields in
   the IEEE floating point format [IEEE], with priority 0 first and
   priority 7 last.  The units are bytes (not bits!) per second.

   The content of the Switching Capability specific information field
   depends on the value of the Switching Capability field.

   When the Switching Capability field is PSC-1, PSC-2, PSC-3, or PSC-4,
   the Switching Capability specific information field includes Minimum
   LSP Bandwidth, Interface MTU, and padding.

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                  Minimum LSP Bandwidth                        |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |           Interface MTU       |            Padding            |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The Minimum LSP Bandwidth is encoded in a 4 octets field in the IEEE
   floating point format.  The units are bytes (not bits!) per second.
   The Interface MTU is encoded as a 2 octets integer.  The padding is 2
   octets, and is used to make the Interface Switching Capability
   Descriptor sub-TLV 32-bits aligned.  It SHOULD be set to zero by the
   sender and SHOULD be ignored by the receiver.

   When the Switching Capability field is L2SC, there is no Switching
   Capability specific information field present.

   When the Switching Capability field is TDM, the Switching Capability
   specific information field includes Minimum LSP Bandwidth, an
   indication whether the interface supports Standard or Arbitrary
   SONET/SDH, and padding.

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                  Minimum LSP Bandwidth                        |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |   Indication  |                 Padding                       |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The Minimum LSP Bandwidth is encoded in a 4 octets field in the IEEE
   floating point format.  The units are bytes (not bits!) per second.
   The indication whether the interface supports Standard or Arbitrary
   SONET/SDH is encoded as 1 octet.  The value of this octet is 0 if the
   interface supports Standard SONET/SDH, and 1 if the interface
   supports Arbitrary SONET/SDH.  The padding is 3 octets, and is used
   to make the Interface Switching Capability Descriptor sub-TLV 32-bits
   aligned.  It SHOULD be set to zero by the sender and SHOULD be
   ignored by the receiver.

   When the Switching Capability field is LSC, there is no Switching
   Capability specific information field present.







3. IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new BGP attribute.

4. Security Considerations

   This extension to BGP does not change the underlying security issues
   inherent in the existing BGP.
