                A YANG Model for Managing IPv6 Tunneling
              draft-zheng-intarea-tunneling-for-ipv6-yang-00

Abstract

   This document describes a data model of tunneling for managing IPv6-
   over-IPv4 tunneling, which is used to support the transition from
   IPv4-only networks to integrated IPv4-based and IPv6-based networks.

1.  Introduction

   An IPv6-over-IPv4 tunnel encapsulates IPv6 packets in IPv4 packets
   for delivery across an IPv4 infrastructure (a core network or the
   Internet).  By using these tunnels, nodes in different isolated IPv6
   networks could communicate with each other without upgrading the IPv4
   infrastructure between them.These tunnels can be configured between
   border routers or between a border router and a host; however, both
   tunnel endpoints must support both IPv4 and IPv6 protocol stacks.

   The following types of overlay tunneling mechanisms are normally
   supported by vendors:

   o  Manual

   o  6to4

   o  Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)

   o  IPv4-compatible

   o  Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP)

   The definition of this YANG model reference several correspond RFCs
   which include [RFC4213], [RFC3056], and [RFC5214].

2.  Requirements Language and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119] when they appear in ALL CAPS.  When these words are not in
   ALL CAPS (such as "should" or "Should"), they have their usual

   English meanings, and are not to be interpreted as [RFC2119] key
   words.

   Terminology:

   o  IP: Internet Protocol

   o  IPv4: Internet Protocol version 4

   o  IPv6: Internet Protocol version 6

3.  Design of the IPv6-over-IPv4 Tunneling Model

   This document defines a YANG [RFC6020] configuration data model that
   may be used to configure the IPv6-over-IPv4 Tunneling on a system.

   The model includes the general attributes of current vendors which
   support IPv6-over-IPv4 Tunneling feature.

   This draft addresses the common leafs between almost all vendors, if
   necessary it can be augmented with proprietary features.

   This model consists of tunnel interface name, source interface,
   source IP address, destination IP address and the tunnel mode.  The
   IPv6-over-IPv4 Tunneling feature depend on the IPv6 feature.

   module: tunnel64
      +--rw tunneling-for-IPv6
         +--rw Tunnel* [tunnel-name]
            +--rw tunnel-name               string
            +--ro tunnel-interface-name?    if:interface-ref
            +--rw tunnel-type?              enumeration
