Abstract

  This document sets out some goals beyond those in "Terminology and
  Goals for Internet Fax" [4] for a service to perform fax and high
  quality document transmission across the Internet.

  Internet fax [1,2] defines a way to send fax data over the Internet
  using e-mail.  But there is a clear desire for an application that
  more closely emulates the operational characteristics of
  traditional fax [3].

1. Introduction

  The transmission and reception of renderable documents (i.e. in a
  form that can control their final rendering) is an essential global
  communications service.

  Several protocols and services have been developed over the years
  to facilitate document transmission, including the GSTN Fax
  service, ITU-T T.30 [3].

  Within the IETF several protocols have been developed that can be
  used for document transmission, including Internet fax [1,2] (using
  e-mail protocols) and the Internet Print Protocol [5] (using
  elements from HTTP).  But there are indications that users expect a
  service that more closely emulates the operational characteristics
  of traditional fax [3].

  This document sets out some goals for such a service.

22 October 1999


1.1 Organization of this document

  "Terminology and Goals for Internet Fax" [4] is used as a baseline
  for these goals;  this memo further expands on some issues that
  characterize the current practice of facsimile transmission.  These
  features are intended to facilitate the use of quality document
  transfer in compliance with the legal as well as general custom and
  practice surrounding document transmission by facsimile.

  Section 2 discusses the operational modes for Internet fax, and how
  they might relate to user perceptions of timeliness of message
  delivery.

  Section 3 describes the goals for quality document transfer.  It
  starts with a brief listing of all the goals, then proceeds to
  explain in more detail those that are not described elsewhere.

  Section 4 discusses some additional considerations beyond obvious
  application goals.

1.2 Document conventions

  This memo uses the annotations described in "Terminology and Goals
  for Internet Fax" [4] to indicate levels of desirability for a
  quality document transfer protocol:

  {1}  there is general agreement that this is a critical
       characteristic of any definition of a quality document
       transfer protocol.

  {2}  most believe that this is an important characteristic of a
       quality document transfer protocol.

  {3}  there is general belief that this is a useful feature of a
       quality document transfer protocol, but that other factors
       might override;  a definition that does not provide this
       element is acceptable.

       NOTE:  Comments like this provide additional nonessential
       information about the rationale behind this document, and
       may help those who wish to understand the ideas in
       greater depth.

2. Timeliness characteristics

  RFC 2542 [4], section 2.5, discusses three operational modes for
  Internet fax.  These describe different ways of performing message
  transfer that typically exhibit different behaviours:

  o  "Store and forward" is typically associated with delivery times
     that may vary between minutes and hours, or even days (e.g.
     ordinary Internet mail.)

  o  "Session" relates to a kind of "while-you-wait" service, where
     the length of time one waits may depend on the number of other
     users of the same network resources (e.g. accessing a web page).

     The intent of "session" mode described in RFC 2542 is to provide
     a timely delivery without being constrained by the kind of rigid
     protocol timing constraints that are normal when using a circuit
     based protocol like T.30.)

  o  "Real time" means that delivery is completed within some defined
     maximum time, or the process is deemed to have failed.
     Traditional Group 3 facsimile is a real time service in this
     sense.  True real time behaviour can be difficult to achieve
     reliably in the global Internet.

     RFC 2542 defines "Real-time Internet Fax" to mean a service that
     allows two standard Group 3 fax terminals using T.30 protocols to
     communicate via the Internet.  This specifically requires that
     the various T.30 signals and responses are completed within quite
     short periods of time.

  For the purposes of this memo, these ideas are connoted by the
  characteristic of timely delivery:

  o  "Timely delivery" means that a document is delivered, and any
     confirmation is returned, reliably and within a predictable
     period of time that is short enough to be useful for the purposes
     of routine communications.

3. Goals for High Quality Document Distribution

       [[[It's not clear to me whether we want to separate
       specification requirements from "operational goals" and
       "functional goals", as in RFC2542.  I think we should see
       what material we generate for this.]]]

       [[[What we probably do need to do is separate these into
       goals that must be adressed by a protocol specification,
       and goals that should be addressed by an implementation.
       Non-protocol goals could be migrated to section 4.]]]

  This section recalls and expands upon the goals described in RFC
  2542 [4], sections 4 and 5.

  The goals are:

  o  {1} timely delivery (section 3.1 below, and RFC 2542 section 4.4)

  o  {1} proof of delivery/receipt (section 3.2 below, and RFC 2542
     section 4.3)

  o  {1} date and time information (Section 3.3 below, and RFC 2542
     section 4.10)

  o  {1} data format support (RFC 2542 section 5.1)

  o  {1} quality of output (Section 3.4 below)

  o  {1} capabilities exchange (RFC 2542 sections 4.5 and 5,5)

  o  {1} addressing support (RFC 2542, section 5.3)

  o  {2} legal identity exchange (Section 3.5 below)

  o  {2} legal issues (RFC 2542 section 4.10)

  o  {2} cover pages (Section 3.6 below)

  o  {1} security (RFC 2542 section 4.7)

  o  {2} interworking with other services (Section 3.7 below, and RFC
     2542 section 4.2)

  o  {2} High Quality Document Transfer should be reasonable easy to
     implement (RFC 2542, section 4.6)

  o  {1} a Quality Document Transfer protocol must operate reliably in
     the global Internet.  (See RFC 2542, section 4.8.)

Internet Draft          Additional Goals for Quality Document Transfer
22 October 1999


  o  {3} it is desirable that a Quality Document Transfer protocol
     makes use of existing infrastructure.  (See RFC 2542, sections
     4.2 and 5.2)

  o  {3} features shared with other messaging applications. (See RFC
     2542, sections 2.4.3, 2.4.4)

  o  {3} it is desirable that a Quality Document Transfer protocol
     support and facilitate universal messaging systems (RFC 2542,
     section 2.4.5 [4])

3.1 Timely delivery

  (See RFC 2542, section 4.4.  The timeliness goal for a Quality
  Document Transfer protocol is stonger.)

  A Quality Document Transfer protocol must provide delivery of a
  document immediately, or very soon after it is transmitted.  That
  is, within a period of time that a human user might reasonably wait
  for delivery to be completed (e.g. less than a minute).

3.2 Proof of delivery/receipt

  (See RFC 2542, section 4.3.  The reporting goals are elaborated
  here;  these are mostly implementaton requirements but may have
  some bearing on the protocol design.)

  Detailed progress reports and transaction logs have become standard
  end user requirements for a facsimile service in order to document
  the receipt and confirmation of facsimile delivery.  Current e-mail
  based Internet fax protocols do not fully satisfy the confirmation
  requirements for all current users of traditional facsimile.

  Reports from a Quality Document Transfer terminal:

  o  Must note status (SUCCESS, or FAILURE and information about the
     cause of failure that might be needed to achieve a successful
     transmission)

  o  Must note date and time of all attempts (log files recorded at
     each end by client and server locally)

  o  May note the duration of the transaction

  o  May note the number of document pages transferred

  o  Should indicate the identity of sender and recipient.

22 October 1999


3.3 Date and time information

  (See RFC 2542, section 4.10.  This section expands on the indicated
  legal requirement for date and time of transmission to be
  indicated.)

  Closely associated with the need for transaction receipt and
  notification is the legal requirement (see "Legal issues") that at
  least the first page of a facsimile contain the time and date of
  transmission and that information be included in any facsimile
  service record.

  Facsimile terminal devices all have internal clock devices for
  recording the time/date of transactions.  Actual time information
  is not exchanged "on the wire".  Each device notes when it sends
  and receives documents and logs those transactions appropriately.

  All Internet fax transactions note time/date information in the
  e-mail header information.

  Examples of transaction information that may be useful to record
  include:
     - time of transmission by sender
     - time of reception by receiver
     - time that rendering (e.g. printing) is completed

3.4 Quality of output

  It is a fundamental goal of High Quality Document Transfer that not
  only is the information content of a document transferred, but also
  that high presentation quality can be achieved.

  Received documents should be capable of presentation that allows
  them to be used directly in the same ways that a locally prepared
  document might be used.  (Contrast with traditional facsimile,
  which typicaly does not provide an image one would choose to use
  directly in an internal report.)

3.5 Sender and receiver identity exchange

  (See RFC 2542, section 4.10.  This section expands on the indicated
  requirement for the identity of the sender to be indicated.)

  Some jurisdictions impose a requirement for a fax machine to
  disclose its identity under certain circumstances.  This disclosure
  is achieved for traditional facsimile through local configuration
  of the fax terminal, and the exchange of T.30 CSID frames between
  terminal devices.




Klyne & Shockey            Work-in-progress                   [Page 7]

Internet Draft          Additional Goals for Quality Document Transfer
22 October 1999


  Internet fax uses e-mail header information to identify the sender
  to the recipient.

  A Quality Document Transfer protocol should define a mechanism for
  achieving a full exchange of identity between a sender and
  receiver.

3.6 Cover page

  Closely associated with the legal issues are the formats and
  requirements for cover pages.

  A Quality Document Transfer protocol should provide a mechanism to
  include cover page information that conforms to the legal or
  general custom and practice applied to facsimile services, when
  such information is not already part of the document being sent.

  To satisfy legal requirements for Facsimile transmission cover
  pages:
     o Must contain identification of Sender:
     o Should contain identification of Recipient:
     o Must contain time/Date of Transmission:
     o May contain number of pages in Transmission:
     o May contain an area for short comments:

  Workstation software, when operating in a facsimile service mode,
  should offer cover page generation options and may offer other
  features, as deemed appropriate.

  If possible, cover page information should be distinguishable from
  message payload data (e.g. see the cover page proposal for Internet
  fax [21]).

3.7 Interworking with other services

  (See RFC 2542, section 4.2 and section 2.)

  It is likely that a High Quality Document Transfer system will be
  required to gateway to another document distribution service;  this
  may require conversion of the available document data to/from a
  format used by the other service.  Choice of baseline data formats
  and capabilities will ideally be compatible with other applications
  with which systems may be required to interwork.


4. Other considerations

  This section discusses some considerations for High Quality
  Document Distribution that do not create readily identifiable
  application goals.

Internet Draft          Additional Goals for Quality Document Transfer
22 October 1999


4.1 Third party operation

  In some environments, it may be desirable to hand off delivery of a
  document to some third party and report back (a) the fact that the
  hand-off has occurred, and (b) subsequent indication from the third
  party that delivery has indeed been effected.

  An example of this kind of scenario would be a service that
  received documents electronically, printed them, then obtains a
  signature when delivering the physical document.


5. Internationalization considerations

  Quality document transfer must be regarded as a global service, and
  any specification must have consideration for:

  o  {1} transferring documents whose contents are expressed in a
     variety of national symbol sets.

  o  {2} transferring documents whose contents are expressed in a
     variety of national languages (in some cases, the language of the
     content may be important to its rendering;  e.g. text-to-speech
     processing).

  o  {3} document transfer destination adressess that may be expressed
     in a variety of national symbol sets (e.g. the names of a person
     to whom a document is addressed).

       NOTE:  There are a number of documents covering
       internationalization issues:  RFC 2130 [6], RFC 2277 [7]
       and others [8].


6. Security considerations

  Security goals and considerations are addressed by RFC 2542.

Appendix A: Revision history

  [[[Please remove this section on publication]]]

  00a  23-Jul-1999  Initial draft, based on an earlier document by
                    Richard Shockey.

  00b  08-Sep-1999  Incorporate Richard's review comments.

  01a  04-Oct-1999  Align goals more closely with RFC 2542;  remove
                    some text that duplicates RFC 2542.

  01b  18-Oct-1999  Re-work introductory text slightly.

  02a  22-Oct-1999  Extensive editing following early review comments,
                    particularly to improve the alignment of ideas and
                    text with RFC 2542.

  02b  22-Oct-1999  Further cut back the goals section;  add new
                    section for "Other considerations".

  TODO:

  o  Finalize references

  o  Separate "operational" and "functional" goals?  (section 4 intro)

  o  Separate confirmation of receipt/proof of delivery?
