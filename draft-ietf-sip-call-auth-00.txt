1. Abstract

   This document describes the need for call authorization and offers a
   mechanism for call authorization that can be used for admission control
   and against denial of service attacks.

2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [2].

3. Background and Motivation

   The current IP Telephony systems consider a perfect world in which there
   is unlimited amount of bandwidth and network layer QoS comes free.  The
   reality is that bandwidth is neither unlimited nor free. Enhanced quality
   of service, as required for high-grade voice communication, needs special
   authorization for better than 'best-effort' service.  Without such a
   capability, it is possible that a single berserk IP telephony device can
   cause denial of service to a significant number of others.

4. Overview

   Integration of Media Authorization and Call Signaling architecture
   consists of User Agents (UAs) which are considered untrusted, and SIP-
   Proxy which authorizes the call that is initiated by UA.

   The SIP-Proxy authorizes the Media data flow to/from the UA and returns
   to the UA a Media-Authorization-Token, which is to be used for
   authorization when bandwidth is requested for the data-stream.

   When the UA is ready to send the media data-stream to the other end-
   point, it first requests bandwidth, using the Authorization-Token it
   received from its SIP-Proxy.

5. Changes to SIP to Support Media Authorization

   This document extends SIP in support of an authorization scheme. In this
   architecture the SIP-Proxy supplies the UA an Authorization-Token which
   is to be used for bandwidth requests. The extension defined allows
   network resources to be authorized by the SIP-Proxy.

   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur Form
   (BNF) as described in RFC-2234 [3].

                SIP Extensions for Media Authorization   November 2000


5.1 SIP Header Extension

   The Media-Auth-Token general header conveys an identifier of the local
   Gate to a UA.  This information is used for authorizing the Media Stream.

        Media-Auth       = "Media- Authorization" ":"
                                Media-Authorization-Token

        Media-Authorization-Token       = 1*hex

5.2 SIP Procedures

   This section defines a SIP [4] profile for usage in Media Authorization
   compatible systems from the point of view of Authorizing Calls.

   The initial SIP INVITE message, as well as mid-call resource change
   messages and mid-call changes in call destination should be authorized.
   These SIP messages are sent through the proxies to receive this
   authorization.

5.2.1. User Agent Client (UAC)

   The Media-Auth-Token, contained in the Media-Authorization header, is
   included in the first response message sent by the SIP-Proxy to the UAC.

   The UAC SHOULD use the Media-Auth-Token when requesting bandwidth for
   Media data stream during initiation and retaining of the bandwidth.

5.2.2. User Agent Server (UAS)

   The User Agent Server receives the Media-Auth-Token in the INVITE message
   from SIP-Proxy.

   The UAS SHOULD use the Media-Auth-Token when requesting bandwidth for
   media data stream during initiation and retaining of the bandwidth.

5.2.3. Originating Proxy (OP)

   The Originating Proxy (OP) authenticates the caller, and verifies the
   caller is authorized to receive the requested level of QoS.  In
   cooperation with originating Policy Decision Point (PDP-o), the OP
   obtains a Media-Auth-Token that contains sufficient information for the
   UAC to get the authorized bandwidth for the media streams.

   The Originating Proxy MUST insert the Media-Authorization header in the
   response message that it sends to UAC.


5.2.4. Destination Proxy (DP)

   The Destination Proxy (DP) authenticates the called party, and verifies
   the called party is authorized to receive the requested level of QoS.  In
   cooperation with termination Policy Decision Point (PDP-t), the DP

                SIP Extensions for Media Authorization   November 2000

   obtains a Media-Auth-Token that contains sufficient information for the
   destination server to get the authorized bandwidth for the media streams.

   The Destination Proxy MUST insert the Media-Authorization header in the
   INVITE message that it sends to the UAS.

6. Examples

6.1. Requesting Bandwidth via RSVP messaging

   Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) is the end-to-end Layer 3
   reservation protocol that is widely used [7].

6.1.1. User Agent Client Side

   Figure 1 presents a high-level overview of a basic call flow with Media
   Authorization from the viewpoint of the UAC. It is assumed that the SIP-
   Proxy has a previously established authentication relationship with the
   client.

   When a user goes off-hook and dials a telephone number, the UAC collects
   the dialed digits and sends the initial INVITE message to Originating
   SIP-Proxy.

   The Originating SIP-Proxy (OP) authenticates UAC and forwards the INVITE
   message to the proper SIP-proxy.

   Assuming that the call is not forwarded, the other end-point sends a 183
   response to the initial INVITE, forwarded back to OP. Included in this
   response is the negotiated bandwidth requirement for the connection.

   When OP receives the 183, it has sufficient information regarding the
   end-points, bandwidth and characteristics of the media exchange. It
   initiates a Policy-Setup message to POP-o.

   The PDP-o stores the authorized Media description in its local store
   generates an Authorization-Token that points to this description and
   returns the Authorization-Token to OP.

   The OP includes the Authorization-Token in the Media-Auth-Token header
   extension of the 183 message.

   The UAC upon reception stores the Media-Authorization-Token inside the
   Media-Auth-Token header extension.

   Before sending the Media stream, the UAC requests bandwidth using an
   RSVP-PATH message which includes the Session info that describes the
   Media data-stream and TSpec that describes the bandwidth requested along
   with Authorization information that was stored in Media-Authorization-
   Token.

   ERo, upon reception of the RSVP-PATHo message checks the authorization
   through a PDP-o COPS message exchange. The PDPo checks the authorization
   using the stored authorized Media description that was linked to
   Authorization-Token that it returned to OP. If authorization is
   successful PDPo returns an "install" Decision.

   ERo checks the admissibility for the call and if admission succeeds, it
   forwards the RSVP-PATHo message.

   Once UAC receives the RSVP-PATHt message it sends RSVP-RESVt message to
   reserve the bandwidth.

   ERo, upon reception of the RSVP-RESVt message checks the authorization
   through a PDPo COPS message exchange. The PDPo checks the authorization
   using the stored authorized Media description that was linked to
   Authorization-Token that it returned to OP. If authorization is
   successful PDPo returns an "install" Decision.

   ERo checks the admissibility for the call and if admission succeeds, it
   forwards the RSVP-RESVt message.

   Upon reception of RSVP-RESVo message the UAC sends RSVP-RESVCONFo message
   to indicate that the reservation completed for one direction.

   Upon reception of both RSVP-RESVCONFt and 200OK the UAC returns ACK
   message.

6.1.2. User Agent Server Side

   Figure 2 presents a high-level overview of a call flow with Media
   Authorization from the viewpoint of the UAS. It is assumed that the SIP-
   Proxy has a previously established authentication relationship with the
   client.

   Since the Destination SIP-Proxy (DP) has sufficient information regarding
   the end-points, bandwidth and characteristics of the media exchange, it
   initiates a Policy-Setup message to the termination Policy Decision Point
   (PDPt).

   The PDP-t stores the authorized Media description in its local store
   generates an Authorization-Token that points to this description and
   returns the Authorization-Token to DP.

   Assuming that the call is not forwarded, the UAS sends a 183 response to
   the initial INVITE message, which is forwarded back to UAC. At the same
   time UAS sends RSVP-PATHt message for Media data-stream that includes the
   Session info that describes the Media data-stream and TSpec that
   describes the bandwidth requested along with Authorization information
   that was stored in Media-Authorization-Token.

   ERt, upon reception of the RSVP-PATHt message checks the authorization
   through a PDPt COPS message exchange. The PDPt checks the authorization
   using the stored authorized Media description that was linked to
   Authorization-Token that it returned to DP. If authorization is
   successful PDPt returns an "install" Decision.

   ERt checks the admissibility for the call and if admission succeeds, it
   forwards the RSVP-PATHt message.

   Once the UAS receives the RSVP-PATHo message, it sends RSVP-RESVo message
   to reserve the bandwidth.

   ERt, upon reception of the RSVP-RESVo message, checks the authorization
   through a PDPt COPS message exchange. The PDPt checks the authorization
   using the stored authorized Media description that was linked to
   Authorization-Token that it returned to DP. If authorization is
   successful PDPt returns an "install" Decision.

   ERt checks the admissibility for the call and if admission succeeds, it
   forwards the RSVP-RESVo message.

   Upon reception of RSVP-RESVo message the UAS sends RSVP-RESVCONFt message
   to indicate that the reservation completed for one direction.

   Upon reception of both RSVP-RESVCONFo and 200OK the UAS returns ACK
   message.

6.2. Requesting Bandwidth via DOCSIS MAC messaging

   The DOCSIS MAC layer [5] QoS Set-Up the call flows are different in the
   sense that the Authorization token is a simple 32bit number [6]. And DSA-
   REQ, DSA-RSP, and DSA-ACK are layer 2 messages that are specific to and
   optimized for Cable environment which simplifies/reduces delays for the
   embedded client implementation [6].

6.2.1. User Agent Client Side


   Figure 3 presents a high-level overview of a call flow with Media
   Authorization from the viewpoint of the UAC.  It is assumed that the SIP-
   Proxy has a previously established authentication relationship with the
   client.

   When a user goes off-hook and dials a telephone number, the originating
   SIP Client (UAC) collects the dialed digits and sends the initial INVITE
   message to Originating SIP-Proxy.

   The Originating SIP-Proxy (OP) authenticates UAC and forwards the INVITE
   message to the proper destination SIP-proxy.

   Assuming that the call is not forwarded, the other end-point sends a 183
   response to the initial INVITE, forwarded back to OP. Included in this
   response is the negotiated bandwidth requirement for the connection.

                SIP Extensions for Media Authorization   November 2000


   When OP receives the 183, it has sufficient information regarding the
   end-points, bandwidth and characteristics of the media exchange. It sends
   a Gate-Setup message to ER/CMTSo containing Media data-stream description
   and bandwidth characteristics. The ER/CMTSo returns a 32 bit index value
   that inside ER/CMTSo points to Media definition that OP send out.

   UAC sends DSA-REQ message asking for bandwidth, which includes the 32 bit
   index value.

   ER/CMTSo, upon reception of the RSA-REQ message uses the index value to
   find the authorized media description. Checks the requested media link
   against authorized if the both authorization and admission succeeds it
   starts a layer 2 link for Media data-stream on the Cable Access link and
   returns DSA-RSP, which is acknowledged by UAC via DSA-ACK message.

   Upon reception of 200OK the UAC returns ACK message.

6.2.2. User Agent Server Side

   Figure 4 presents a high-level overview of a basic call flow with Media
   Authorization from the viewpoint of the UAS. It is assumed that the
   Destination SIP-Proxy (DP) has a previously established authentication
   relationship with the UAS.

   When DP receives the INVITE message, it has sufficient information
   regarding the end-points, bandwidth and characteristics of the media
   exchange. It sends a Gate-Setup message to ER/CMTSt containing Media
   data-stream description and bandwidth characteristics. The ER/CMTSt
   returns a 32 bit index value that inside ER/CMTSt points to Media
   definition that DP send out.

   The DP includes the 32 bit index value in the Media-Auth-Token header
   extension that its including into the INVITE message.

   The UAS sends a 183 response to the initial INVITE, which is forwarded
   back to UAC. At the same time UAS sends DSA-REQ message asking for
   bandwidth which includes the 32 bit index value.

   ER/CMTSt, upon reception of the RSA-REQ message uses the index value to
   find the authorized media description. Checks the requested media link
   against authorized if the both authorization and admission succeeds it
   starts a layer 2 link for Media data-stream on the Cable Access link and
   returns DSA-RSP, which is acknowledged by UAC via DSA-ACK message. Upon
   reception of DSA-RSP the UAS returns ACK message.

7. Advantages of the Proposed Approach

   The use of call authorization makes it possible to control the
   utilization of network resources. This in turn makes IP Telephony more
   robust against denial of service attacks and various kinds of service
   frauds.

   Using the authorization capability, the service provider can control the
   number of flows, the amount of bandwidth, and the end-point reached
   making the IP Telephony system dependable in the presence of scarce
   resources.


8. Security Considerations

   Media Authorization Tokens sent from a SIP-Proxy to a UAC/UAS MUST be
   protected from eavesdropping, through a mechanism such as IPSec.
