                  I2NSF NSF Monitoring YANG Data Model
             draft-ietf-i2nsf-nsf-monitoring-data-model-03

Abstract

   This document proposes an information model and the corresponding
   YANG data model for monitoring Network Security Functions (NSFs) in
   the Interface to Network Security Functions (I2NSF) framework.  If
   the monitoring of NSFs is performed in a comprehensive way, it is
   possible to detect the indication of malicious activity, anomalous
   behavior or the potential sign of denial of service attacks in a
   timely manner.  This monitoring functionality is based on the
   monitoring information that is generated by NSFs.  Thus, this
   document describes not only an information model for monitoring NSFs
   along with a YANG data diagram, but also the corresponding YANG data
   model for monitoring NSFs.

1.  Introduction

   According to [I-D.ietf-i2nsf-terminology], the interface provided by
   a Network Security Function (NSF) (e.g., Firewall, IPS, Anti-DDoS, or
   Anti-Virus function) to administrative entities (e.g., Security
   Controller) to enable remote management (i.e., configuring and
   monitoring) is referred to as an I2NSF NSF-Facing Interface

   [I-D.ietf-i2nsf-nsf-facing-interface-dm].  Monitoring procedures
   intent to acquire vital types of data with respect to NSFs, (e.g.,
   alarms, records, and counters) via data in motion (e.g., queries,
   notifications, and events).  The monitoring of NSF plays an important
   role in an overall security framework, if it is done in a timely and
   comprehensive way.  The monitoring information generated by an NSF
   can be a good, early indication of anomalous behavior or malicious
   activity, such as denial of service attacks (DoS).

   This document defines a comprehensive NSF monitoring information
   model that provides visibility for an NSF for Security Controller.
   It specifies the information and illustrates the methods that enable
   an NSF to provide the information required in order to be monitored
   in a scalable and efficient way via the NSF-Facing Interface.  The
   information model for monitoring presented in this document is a
   complementary information model to the information model for the
   security policy provisioning functionality of the NSF-Facing
   Interface specified in [I-D.ietf-i2nsf-capability].

   This document also defines a YANG [RFC7950] data model for monitoring
   NSFs, which is derived from the information model for NSF monitoring.

2.  Terminology

2.1.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] [RFC8174].

2.2.  Definitions

   The terms, which are used in this document, are defined in the I2NSF
   terminology document [I-D.ietf-i2nsf-terminology] [RFC8329].

2.3.  YANG

   This document follows the guidelines of [RFC6087], uses the common
   YANG types defined in [RFC6991], and adopts the Network Management
   Datastore Architecture (NMDA) [RFC8342].  The meaning of the symbols
   in tree diagrams is defined in [RFC8340].

3.  Use Cases for NSF Monitoring Data

   As mentioned earlier, monitoring plays a critical role in an overall
   security framework.  The monitoring of the NSF provides very valuable
   information to the security controller in maintaining the provisioned

   security posture.  Besides this, there are various other reasons to
   monitor the NSF as listed below:

   o  The security administrator with I2NSF User can configure a policy
      that is triggered on a specific event occurring in the NSF or the
      network [RFC8329] [I-D.ietf-i2nsf-consumer-facing-interface-dm].
      If a security controller detects the specified event, it
      configures additional security functions as defined by policies.

   o  The events triggered by an NSF as a result of security policy
      violation can be used by Security Information and Event Management
      (SIEM) to detect any suspicious activity in a larger correlation
      context.

   o  The events and activity logs from an NSF can be used to build
      advanced analytics, such as behavior and predictive models to
      improve security posture in large deployments.

   o  The security controller can use events from the NSF for achieving
      high availability.  It can take corrective actions such as
      restarting a failed NSF and horizontally scaling up the NSF.

   o  The events and activity logs from the NSF can aid in the root
      cause analysis of an operational issue, so it can improve
      debugging.

   o  The activity logs from the NSF can be used to build historical
      data for operational and business reasons.

4.  Classification of NSF Monitoring Data

   In order to maintain a strong security posture, it is not only
   necessary not only to configure an NSF's security policies but also
   to continuously monitor the NSF by consuming acquirable and
   observable information.  This enables security administrators to
   assess the state of the network topology in a timely fashion.  It is
   not possible to block all the internal and external threats based on
   static security posture.  A more practical approach is supported by
   enabling dynamic security measures, for which continuous visibility
   is required.  This document defines a set of information elements
   (and their scope) that can be acquired from an NSF and can be used as
   NSF monitoring information.  In essence, these types of monitoring
   information can be leveraged to support constant visibility on
   multiple levels of granularity and can be consumed by the
   corresponding functions.

   Three basic domains about the monitoring information originating from
   a system entity [RFC4949] or an NSF are highlighted in this document.

   o  Retention and Emission

   o  Notifications and Events

   o  Unsolicited Poll and Solicited Push

   The Alarm Management Framework in [RFC3877] defines an Event as
   something that happens which may be of interest.  It defines a fault
   as a change in status, crossing a threshold, or an external input to
   the system.  In the I2NSF domain, I2NSF events
   [I-D.ietf-i2nsf-terminology] are created and the scope of the Alarm
   Management Framework's Events is still applicable due to its broad
   definition.  The model presented in this document elaborates on the
   workflow of creating I2NSF events in the context of NSF monitoring
   and on the way initial I2NSF events are created.

   As with I2NSF components, every generic system entity can include a
   set of capabilities [I-D.ietf-i2nsf-terminology] that creates
   information about the context, composition, configuration, state or
   behavior of that system entity.  This information is intended to be
   provided to other consumers of information and in the scope of this
   document, which deals with NSF information monitoring in an automated
   fashion.

4.1.  Retention and Emission

   Typically, a system entity populates standardized interface, such as
   SNMP, NETCONF, RESTCONF or CoMI to provide and emit created
   information directly via NSF-Facing Interface
   [I-D.ietf-i2nsf-terminology].  Alternatively, the created information
   is retained inside the system entity (or a hierarchy of system
   entities in a composite device) via records or counters that are not
   exposed directly via NSF-Facing Interfaces.

   Information emitted via standardized interfaces can be consumed by an
   I2NSF User [I-D.ietf-i2nsf-terminology] that includes the capability
   to consume information not only via an I2NSF Interface(e.g.,
   [I-D.ietf-i2nsf-consumer-facing-interface-dm]) but also via
   interfaces complementary to the standardized interfaces a generic
   system entity provides.

   Information retained on a system entity requires a corresponding
   I2NSF User to access aggregated records of information, typically in
   the form of log-files or databases.  There are ways to aggregate
   records originating from different system entities over a network,
   for examples via Syslog Protocol [RFC5424] or Syslog over TCP
   [RFC6587].  But even if records are conveyed, the result is the same




Jeong, et al.           Expires November 8, 2020                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft    I2NSF NSF Monitoring YANG Data Model          May 2020


   kind of retention in form of a bigger aggregate of records on another
   system entity.

   An I2NSF User is required to process fresh [RFC4949] records created
   by I2NSF Functions in order to provide them to other I2NSF Components
   via the corresponding I2NSF Interfaces in a timely manner.  This
   process is effectively based on homogenizing functions, which can
   access and convert specific kinds of records into information that
   can be provided and emitted via I2NSF interfaces.

   When retained or emitted, the information required to support
   monitoring processes has to be processed by an I2NSF User at some
   point in the workflow.  Typical locations of these I2NSF Users are:

   o  a system entity that creates the information

   o  a system entity that retains an aggregation of records

   o  an I2NSF Component that includes the capabilities of using
      standardized interfaces provided by other system entities that are
      not I2NSF Components

   o  an I2NSF Component that creates the information

4.2.  Notifications and Events

   A specific task of I2NSF User is to process I2NSF Policy Rules
   [I-D.ietf-i2nsf-terminology].  The rules of a policy are composed of
   three clauses: Events, Conditions, and Actions.  In consequence, an
   I2NSF Event is specified to trigger an I2NSF Policy Rule.  Such an
   I2NSF Event is defined as any important occurrence over time in the
   system being managed, and/or in the environment of the system being
   managed in [I-D.ietf-i2nsf-terminology], which aligns well with the
   generic definition of Event from [RFC3877].

   The model illustrated in this document introduces a complementary
   type of information that can be a conveyed notification.

   Notification:  An occurrence of a change of context, composition,
      configuration, state or behavior of a system entity that can be
      directly or indirectly observed by an I2NSF User and can be used
      as input for an event-clause in I2NSF Policy Rules.

      A notification is similar to an I2NSF Event with the exception
      that it is created by a system entity that is not an I2NSF
      Component and that its importance is yet to be assessed.
      Semantically, a notification is not an I2NSF Event in the context
      of I2NSF, although they can potentially use the exact same



Jeong, et al.           Expires November 8, 2020                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft    I2NSF NSF Monitoring YANG Data Model          May 2020


      information or data model.  In respect to [RFC3877], a
      Notification is a specific subset of events, because they convey
      information about something that happens which may be of interest.
      In consequence, Notifications may contain information with very
      low expressiveness or relevance.  Hence, additional post-
      processing functions, such as aggregation, correlation or simple
      anomaly detection, might have to be employed to satisfy a level of
      expressiveness that is required for an event-clause of an I2NSF
      Policy Rule.

   It is important to note that the consumer of a notification (the
   observer) assesses the importance of a notification and not the
   producer.  The producer can include metadata in a notification that
   supports the observer in assessing the importance (even metadata
   about severity), but the deciding entity is an I2NSF User.

4.3.  Unsolicited Poll and Solicited Push

   The freshness of the monitored information depends on the acquisition
   method.  Ideally, an I2NSF User is accessing every relevant
   information about the I2NSF Component and is emitting I2NSF Events to
   a monitor entity(e.g., Security Controller and I2NSF User) NSF
   timely.  Publication of events via a pubsub/broker model, peer-2-peer
   meshes, or static defined channels are only a few examples on how a
   solicited push of I2NSF Events can be facilitated.  The actual
   mechanic implemented by an I2NSF Component is out of the scope of
   this document.

   Often, the corresponding management interfaces have to be queried in
   intervals or on-demand if required by an I2NSF Policy rule.  In some
   cases, a collection of information has to be conducted via login
   mechanics provided by a system entity.  Accessing records of
   information via this kind of unsolicited polls can introduce a
   significant latency in regard to the freshness of the monitored
   information.  The actual definition of intervals implemented by an
   I2NSF Component is also out of scope of this document.

4.4.  I2NSF Monitoring Terminology for Retained Information

   Records:  Unlike information emitted via notifications and events,
      records do not require immediate attention from an analyst but may
      be useful for visibility and retroactive cyber forensic.
      Depending on the record format, there are different qualities in
      regard to structure and detail.  Records are typically stored in
      log-files or databases on a system entity or NSF.  Records in the
      form of log-files usually include less structures but potentially
      more detailed information in regard to the changes of a system
      entity's characteristics.  In contrast, databases often use more



Jeong, et al.           Expires November 8, 2020                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft    I2NSF NSF Monitoring YANG Data Model          May 2020


      strict schemas or data models, therefore enforcing a better
      structure.  However, they inhibit storing information that do not
      match those models ("closed world assumption").  Records can be
      continuously processed by I2NSF Agents that act as I2NSF Producer
      and emit events via functions specifically tailored to a certain
      type of record.  Typically, records are information generated
      either by an NSF or a system entity about operational and
      informational data, or various changes in system characteristics,
      such as user activities, network/traffic status, and network
      activity.  They are important for debugging, auditing and security
      forensic.

   Counters:  A specific representation of continuous value changes of
      information elements that potentially occur in high frequency.
      Prominent example are network interface counters, e.g., PDU amount
      or byte amount, drop counters, and error counters.  Counters are
      useful in debugging and visibility into operational behavior of an
      NSF.  An I2NSF Agent that observes the progression of counters can
      act as an I2NSF Producer and emit events in respect to I2NSF
      Policy Rules.

5.  Conveyance of NSF Monitoring Information

   As per the use cases of NSF monitoring data, information needs to be
   conveyed to various I2NSF Consumers based on requirements imposed by
   I2NSF Capabilities and workflows.  There are multiple aspects to be
   considered in regard to the emission of monitoring information to
   requesting parties as listed below:

   o  Pull-Push Model: A set of data can be pushed by an NSF to a
      requesting party or pulled by a requesting party from an NSF.
      Specific types of information might need both the models at the
      same time if there are multiple I2NSF Consumers with varying
      requirements.  In general, any I2NSF Event including a high
      severity assessment is considered to be of great importance and
      should be processed as soon as possible (push-model).  Records, in
      contrast, are typically not as critical (pull-model).  The I2NSF
      Architecture does not mandate a specific scheme for each type of
      information and is therefore out of scope of this document.

   o  Pub-Sub Model: In order for an I2NSF Provider to push monitoring
      information to multiple appropriate I2NSF Consumers, a
      subscription can be maintained by both I2NSF Components.
      Discovery of available monitoring information can be supported by
      an I2NSF Controller that takes the role of a broker and therefore
      includes I2NSF Capabilities that support registration.

   o  Export Frequency: Monitoring information can be emitted
      immediately upon generation by an NSF to requesting I2NSF
      Consumers or can be pushed periodically.  The frequency of
      exporting the data depends upon its size and timely usefulness.
      It is out of the scope of I2NSF and left to each NSF
      implementation.

   o  Authentication: There may be a need for authentication between an
      I2NSF Producer of monitoring information and its corresponding
      I2NSF Consumer to ensure that critical information remains
      confidential.  Authentication in the scope of I2NSF can also
      require its corresponding content authorization.  This may be
      necessary, for example, if an NSF emits monitoring information to
      an I2NSF Consumer outside its administrative domain.  The I2NSF
      Architecture does not mandate when and how specific authentication
      has to be implemented.

   o  Data-Transfer Model: Monitoring information can be pushed by an
      NSF using a connection-less model that does require a persistent
      connection or streamed over a persistent connection.  An
      appropriate model depends on the I2NSF Consumer requirements and
      the semantics of the information to be conveyed.

   o  Data Model and Interaction Model for Data in Motion: There are a
      lot of transport mechanisms such as IP, UDP, and TCP.  There are
      also open source implementations for specific set of data such as
      systems counter, e.g.  IPFIX [RFC7011] and NetFlow [RFC3954].  The
      I2NSF does not mandate any specific method for a given data set,
      so it is up to each implementation.

5.1.  Information Types and Acquisition Methods

   In this document, most defined information types defined benefit from
   high visibility with respect to value changes, e.g., alarms and
   records.  In contrast, values that change monotonically in a
   continuous way do not benefit from this high visibility.  On the
   contrary, emitting each change would result in a useless amount of
   value updates.  Hence, values, such as counter, are best acquired in
   periodic intervals.

   The mechanisms provided by YANG Push [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push] and
   YANG Subscribed Notifications
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications] address exactly these set
   of requirements.  YANG also enables semantically well-structured
   information, as well as subscriptions to datastores or event streams
   - by changes or periodically.

   In consequence, this information model in this document is intended
   to support data models used in solicited or unsolicited event streams
   that potentially are facilitated by a subscription mechanism.  A
   subset of information elements defined in the information model
   address this domain of application.

6.  Basic Information Model for All Monitoring Data

   As explained in the above section, there is a wealth of data
   available from the NSF that can be monitored.  Firstly, there must be
   some general information with each monitoring message sent from an
   NSF that helps a consumer to identify meta data with that message,
   which are listed as below:

   o  message_version: It indicates the version of the data format and
      is a two-digit decimal numeral starting from 01.

   o  message_type: Event, Alert, Alarm, Log, Counter, etc.

   o  time_stamp: It indicates the time when the message is generated.

   o  vendor_name: The name of the NSF vendor.

   o  NSF_name: The name (or IP) of the NSF generating the message.

   o  Module_name: The module name outputting the message.

   o  Severity: It indicates the level of the logs.  There are total
      eight levels, from 0 to 7.  The smaller the numeral is, the higher
      the severity is.

7.  Extended Information Model for Monitoring Data

   This section covers the additional information associated with the
   system messages.  The extended information model is only for the
   structured data such as alarm.  Any unstructured data is specified

8.  NSF Monitoring Management in I2NSF

   A standard model for monitoring data is required for an administrator
   to check the monitoring data generated by an NSF.  The administrator
   can check the monitoring data through the following process.  When
   the NSF monitoring data that is under the standard format is
   generated, the NSF forwards it to the security controller.  The

   security controller delivers it to I2NSF Consumer or Developer's
   Management System (DMS) so that the administrator can know the state
   of the I2NSF framework.

   In order to communicate with other components, an I2NSF framework
   [RFC8329] requires the interfaces.  The three main interfaces in
   I2NSF framework are used for sending monitoring data as follows:

   o  I2NSF Consumer-Facing Interface
      [I-D.ietf-i2nsf-consumer-facing-interface-dm]: When an I2NSF User
      makes a security policy and forwards it to the Security Controller
      via Consumer-Facing Interface, it can specify the threat-feed for
      threat prevention, the custom list, the malicious code scan group,
      and the event map group.  They can be used as an event to be
      monitored by an NSF.

   o  I2NSF Registration Interface
      [I-D.ietf-i2nsf-registration-interface-dm]: The Network Functions
      Virtualization (NFV) architecture provides the lifecycle
      management of a Virtual Network Function (VNF) via the Ve-Vnfm
      interface.  The role of Ve-Vnfm is to request VNF lifecycle
      management (e.g., the instantiation and de-instantiation of an
      NSF, and load balancing among NSFs), exchange configuration
      information, and exchange status information for a network
      service.  In the I2NSF framework, the DMS manages data about
      resource states and network traffic for the lifecycle management
      of an NSF.  Therefore, the generated monitoring data from NSFs are
      delivered from the Security Controller to the DMS via Registration
      Interface.  These data are delivered from the DMS to the VNF
      Manager in the Management and Orchestration (MANO) in the NFV
      system [I-D.yang-i2nsf-nfv-architecture].

   o  I2NSF NSF-Facing Interface
      [I-D.ietf-i2nsf-nsf-facing-interface-dm]: After a high-level
      security policy from I2NSF User is translated by security policy
      translator [I-D.yang-i2nsf-security-policy-translation] in the
      Security Controller, the translated security policy (i.e., low-
      level policy) is applied to an NSF via NSF-Facing Interface.  The
      monitoring data model specifies the list of events that can
      trigger Event-Condition-Action (ECA) policies via NSF-Facing
      Interface.

11.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to register the following URI in the
   "IETF XML Registry" [RFC3688]:

              URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-i2nsf-monitor
              Registrant Contact: The IESG.
              XML: N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.


   This document requests IANA to register the following YANG module in
   the "YANG Module Names" registry [RFC6020][RFC7950].

      name: ietf-i2nsf-monitor
              namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-i2nsf-monitor
              prefix: iim
              reference: RFC XXXX

12.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module described in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC8341] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   All data nodes defined in the YANG module which can be created,
   modified and deleted (i.e., config true, which is the default) are
   considered sensitive.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config) applied
   to these data nodes without proper protection can negatively affect
   framework operations.  The monitoring YANG module should be protected
   by the secure communication channel, to ensure its confidentiality
   and integrity.  In another side, the NSF and security controller can
   all be faked, which lead to undesirable results (i.e., leakage of an
   NSF's important operational information, and faked NSF sending false
   information to mislead security controller).  The mutual
   authentication is essential to protected against this kind of attack.
   The current mainstream security technologies (i.e., TLS, DTLS, IPSEC,
   and X.509 PKI) can be employed appropriately to provide the above
   security functions.

   In addition, to defend against the DDoS attack caused by a lot of
   NSFs sending massive notifications to the security controller, the
   rate limiting or similar mechanisms should be considered in an NSF
   and security controller, whether in advance or just in the process of
   DDoS attack.
