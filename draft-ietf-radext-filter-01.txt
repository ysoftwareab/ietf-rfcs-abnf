INTERNET-DRAFT           Filter Rule Attribute            20 August 2006


1.  Introduction

   This document defines the NAS-Filter-Rule attribute within the Remote
   Authentication Dialin User Service (RADIUS) which has the same
   functionality as the Diameter NAS-Filter-Rule AVP (400) defined in
   [RFC4005] Section 6.6.  This attribute may prove useful for
   provisioning of filter rules.

   While [RFC2865] Section 5.11 defines the Filter-Id attribute (11),
   this requires that the NAS be pre-populated with the desired filters.
   However, in situations where the server operator does not know which
   filters have been pre-populated, it useful to specify filter rules
   explicitly.

1.1.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terms:

Network Access Server (NAS)
     A device that provides an access service for a user to a network.

RADIUS server
     A RADIUS authentication server is an entity that provides an
     authentication service to a NAS.

RADIUS proxy
     A RADIUS proxy acts as an authentication server to the NAS, and a
     RADIUS client to the RADIUS server.

1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.3.  Attribute Interpretation

   If a NAS conforming to this specification receives an Access-Accept
   packet containing a NAS-Filter-Rule attribute which it cannot apply,
   it MUST act as though it had received an Access-Reject.  [RFC3576]
   requires that a NAS receiving a  Change of Authorization Request
   (CoA-Request) reply with a CoA-NAK if the Request contains an
   unsupported attribute.  It is recommended that an Error-Cause
   attribute with value set to "Unsupported Attribute" (401) be included
   in the CoA-NAK.  As noted in [RFC3576], authorization changes are
   atomic so that this situation does not result in session termination
   and the pre-existing configuration remains unchanged.  As a result,
   no accounting packets should be generated.

2.  NAS-Filter-Rule Attribute

   Description

      This attribute indicates filter rules to be applied for this user.
      Zero or more NAS-Filter-Rule attributes MAY be sent in Access-
      Accept, CoA-Request, or Accounting-Request packets.

      The NAS-Filter-Rule attribute is not intended to be used
      concurrently with any other filter rule attribute, including
      Filter-Id (11) and NAS-Traffic-Rule [Traffic] attributes, and
      SHOULD NOT appear in the same RADIUS packet.  If a Filter-Id
      attribute is present, then implementations of this specification
      MUST silently discard NAS-Filter-Rule attributes, if present.

      Where more than one NAS-Filter-Rule attribute with the same Tag
      field value is included in a RADIUS packet, the String field of
      the attributes are to be concatenated to form a single filter.  As
      noted in [RFC2865] Section 2.3, "the forwarding server MUST NOT
      change the order of any attributes of the same type", so that
      RADIUS proxies will not reorder NAS-Filter-Rule attributes.

      A summary of the NAS-Filter-Rule Attribute format is shown below.
      The fields are transmitted from left to right.

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |     Type      |    Length     |     Tag       |   String...
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Type

      TBD

   Length

      >=4

   Tag

      The Tag field is one octet, and is used to identify the filter
      rule that is represented.  Each filter rule being represented MUST
      utilize a unique Tag field value.  Where a single filter rule
      exceeds 253 octets in length, the filter rule may be encoded
      across multiple NAS-Filter-Rule attributes, each with the same Tag
      value.

INTERNET-DRAFT           Filter Rule Attribute            20 August 2006


   String

      The String field is one or more octets.  It contains filter rules
      in the IPFilterRule syntax defined in [RFC3588] Section 4.3.
      [RFC3629] UTF-8 encoded 10646 characters are RECOMMENDED, but a
      robust implementation SHOULD support the field as undistinguished
      octets.

3.  Table of Attributes

   The following table provides a guide to which attributes may be found
   in which kinds of packets, and in what quantity.

   Access- Access- Access- Access-   CoA-  Acct-
   Request Accept  Reject  Challenge Req   Req   #   Attribute
    0       0+      0       0        0+    0+   TBD  NAS-Filter-Rule

   The following table defines the meaning of the above table entries.

     0     This attribute MUST NOT be present in the packet.
     0+    Zero or more instances of this attribute MAY be
           present in the packet.
     0-1   Zero or one instance of this attribute MAY be
           present in the packet.

4.  Diameter Considerations

   [RFC4005] Section 6.6 defines the NAS-Filter-Rule AVP (400) with the
   same functionality as the RADIUS NAS-Filter-Rule attribute.  In order
   to support interoperability, Diameter/RADIUS gateways will need to be
   configured to translate RADIUS attribute TBD to Diameter AVP 400 and
   vice-versa.  Where a Diameter NAS-Filter-Rule AVP contains a filter
   rule larger than 253 octets, Diameter/RADIUS gateways translate the
   AVP to multiple RADIUS NAS-Filter-Rule attributes, each with the same
   Tag field value.  Similarly, when multiple RADIUS NAS-Filter-Rule
   attributes are received with the same Tag field value, the String
   fields of the attributes are concatenated together and encoded as the
   value in a single Diameter NAS-Filter-Rule AVP.  Note that since a
   Diameter AVP can be larger than the maximum RADIUS packet size
   (4096), translation from Diameter to RADIUS may not be possible in
   all cases.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This specification does not create any new registries.

   This document uses the RADIUS [RFC2865] namespace, see
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/radius-types>.  Allocation of four

INTERNET-DRAFT           Filter Rule Attribute            20 August 2006


   updates for the section "RADIUS Attribute Types" is requested. The
   RADIUS attributes for which values are requested are:

   TBD - NAS-Filter-Rule

6.  Security Considerations

   This specification describes the use of RADIUS for purposes of
   authentication, authorization and accounting.  Threats and security
   issues for this application are described in [RFC3579] and [RFC3580];
   security issues encountered in roaming are described in [RFC2607].

   This document specifies a new attribute that can be included in
   existing RADIUS packets, which are protected as described in
   [RFC3579] and [RFC3576].  See those documents for a more detailed
   description.

   A NAS-Filter-Rule attribute sent by a RADIUS server may not be
   understood by the NAS which receives it.  A legacy NAS not compliant
   with this specification may silently discard the NAS-Filter-Rule
   attribute while permitting the user to access the network.  This can
   lead to users improperly receiving unfiltered access to the network.
   As a result, the NAS-Filter-Rule attribute SHOULD only be sent to a
   NAS that is known to support it.
