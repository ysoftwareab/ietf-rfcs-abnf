         Connectivity Provisioning Negotiation Protocol (CPNP)
         draft-boucadair-connectivity-provisioning-protocol-03

Abstract

   This document specifies the Connectivity Provisioning Negotiation
   Protocol (CPNP) which is used to facilitate the dynamic negotiation
   of service parameters between a Customer and a Provider.

   CPNP is a generic protocol that can be used for various negotiation
   purposes that include (but are not necessarily limited to)
   connectivity provisioning services, storage facilities, CDN (Content
   Delivery Networks) footprint, etc.  CPNP can be extended with new
   Information Elements.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines the Connectivity Provisioning Negotiation
   Protocol (CPNP) that is meant to dynamically exchange and negotiate
   the connectivity provisioning parameters, and other service-specific
   parameters, between a Customer and a Provider.  CPNP is a tool that
   introduces automation in the service negotiation and activation
   procedures, thus fostering the overall service delivery process.
   CPNP can be seen as a component of the dynamic negotiation meta-
   domain described in Section 3.4 of [RFC7149].

   CPNP is a generic protocol that can be used for other negotiation
   purposes than connectivity provisioning.  For example, CPNP can be
   used to request extra storage resources, to extend the footprint of a
   CDN (Content Delivery Networks), to enable additional features from a
   cloud Provider, etc.  CPNP can be extended with new Information
   Elements (IEs).

   [I-D.boucadair-connectivity-provisioning-profile]  describes a
   Connectivity Provisioning Profile (CPP) template to capture
   connectivity requirements to be met by a transport infrastructure for
   the delivery of various services such as Voice over IP, IPTV, and VPN
   services.  The CPP document defines the set of IP transfer parameters
   that reflect the guarantees that can be provided by the underlying
   transport network together with a reachability scope and capacity
   needs.  CPNP uses the CPP template to encode connectivity
   provisioning clauses.

   As a reminder, several proposals have been made in the past by the
   community (e.g., COPS-SLS, SrNP (Service Negotiation Protocol), DSNP
   (Dynamic Service Negotiation Protocol, RNAP (Resource Negotiation and
   Pricing Protocol), SNAP (Service Negotiation and Acquisition
   Protocol), etc.).  None of these proposals has been standardized by
   IETF.  It is out of the scope of this document to elaborate on the
   differences between CPNP and the aforementioned proposals.

   This document is organized as follows:

   o  Section 3 defines functional elements involved in CPNP exchanges.
   o  Section 4 introduces several order processing models and precises
      those that are targeted by CPNP.
   o  Section 5 enumerates a non-exhaustive list of use cases that would
      benefit from CPNP.
   o  Section 5 discusses some CPNP deployment models.
   o  Section 7 presents CPNP negotiation model.
   o  Section 8 provides an overview of the protocol.
   o  Section 9 specifies CPNP objects.
   o  Section 10 describes CPNP message validation procedure.
   o  Section 11 specifies the behavior of involved CPNP functional
      elements.
   o  Section 12 discusses some operational guidelines.

2.  Terminology

   This document makes use of the following terms:

   o  Customer: is a business role which denotes an entity that is
      involved in the definition and the possible negotiation of a
      contract, including Connectivity Provisioning Agreement, with a

Internet-Draft                    CPNP                        April 2014


      Provider.  A connectivity provisioning contract is captured in a
      dedicated CPP template, which specifies (among other information):
      the sites to be connected, border nodes, outsourced operations
      (e.g., routing, force via points).  The right to invoke the
      subscribed service may be delegated by the Customer to third-party
      End Users, or brokering services.

   o  Network Provider (or Provider): owns and administers one or many
      transport domain(s) (typically Autonomous System (AS)) composed of
      IP switching and transmission resources (e.g., routing, switching,
      forwarding, etc.).  Network Providers are responsible for ensuring
      connectivity services (e.g., offering global or restricted
      reachability).  Connectivity services offered to Customers are
      captured in contracts from which are derived the technology-
      specific clauses and policies to be enforced by the components
      involved in the connectivity service delivery.  Offered
      connectivity services are not restricted to IP.

3.  CPNP Functional Elements

   The following functional elements are defined:

   o  CPNP client (or client): denotes a software instance that sends
      CPNP requests and receives CPNP responses.  The current operations
      that can be performed by a CPNP client are listed below:

      1.  Create a quotation order (Section 11.1.1).

      2.  Cancel an ongoing quotation order under negotiation
          (Section 11.1.1).

      3.  Withdraw a pre-negotiated order (Section 11.1.2).

      4.  Update a pre-negotiated order (Section 11.1.3).

   o  CPNP server (or server): denotes a software instance that receives
      CPNP requests and sends back CPNP responses accordingly.  The CPNP
      server is responsible for the following operations:

      1.  Quotation order handling (Section 11.2.1).

      2.  Cancel an ongoing quotation order (Section 11.2.2).

      3.  Handling of an order withdrawal (Section 11.2.3).

4.  Order Processing Models

   There are basically three models for customer's order processing
   purposes:

   1.  Frozen model: The Customer cannot negotiate the parameters of the
       service delivered by a Provider.  After consulting a service
       portfolio, the Customer selects the offer he/she wants to
       subscribe and places an order to the Provider.  Order handling is
       quite simple on the Provider side because the service is not
       customized as per Customer's requirements, but rather pre-
       designed to target a group of customers having similar
       requirements (and who therefore share the same Customer
       Provisioning Profile).

   2.  Announcement model: The Provider proceeds to the announcement of
       a set of services templates.  The Customer can then initiate a
       negotiation cycle using these templates to prepare its request
       order.

   3.  Negotiation-based model: Unlike the frozen model, the Customer
       documents his/her requirements in some kind of request for
       quotation which is then sent to one or several Providers.
       Solicited Providers then check whether they can address these
       requirements or not, and get back to the Customer accordingly,
       possibly with an offer that may not exactly match customer's
       requirements (e.g., a 100 Mbps connection cannot be provisioned
       given the amount of available resources, but an 80 Mbps
       connection can be provided).  A negotiation between the Customer
       and the Provider then follows, and an order is placed by the
       Customer eventually, upon completion of the negotiation phase.

   Even if the frozen model could also yield the instantiation of a CPP
   template and CPNP could be used to display the said CPP to the
   Customer and confirm the order is being processed/delivered, etc.,
   this document focuses on the negotiation-based model.

   Order processing management on the Network Provider's side is usually
   connected with the following functional blocks:

   o  Network Provisioning (including Order Activation, Network
      Planning, etc.)

   o  AAA

   o  Sales-related functional blocks (e.g., billing, Customers credit
      checks validation, etc.)

Internet-Draft                    CPNP                        April 2014


   o  Network Impact Analysis

   CPNP does not assume any specific knowledge about these functional
   blocks, but the instantiation of the connectivity provisioning
   requests may be conditioned by the information manipulated by some of
   these blocks.  For example, the resources that can be allocated to
   accommodate the Customer's requirements may depend on the network
   planning policy as well as the number of orders to be processed
   simultaneously over a given period of time.

   This document does not elaborate on how Customers are identified and
   managed by the Provider's Information System.

5.  Sample Use Cases

   A list of CPNP use cases is provided below:

   1.  [RFC4176] introduces the L3VPN Service Order Management
       functional block which is responsible for managing the requests
       initiated by the Customers and tracks the status of the
       completion of the related operations.  CPNP can be used between
       the Customer and the Provider to negotiate L3VPN service
       parameters.  A CPNP server could therefore be part of the L3VPN
       Service Order Management functional block discussed in [RFC4176].

   2.  CPNP can be used between two adjacent domains to deliver IP
       interconnect services (e.g., enable, update, disconnect).  For
       example, two ASes can be connected via several interconnection
       points.  CPNP can be used between these ASes to upgrade existing
       links, request additional resources, provision a new
       interconnection point, etc.

   3.  An integrated Provider can use CPNP to rationalize connectivity
       provisioning needs related to its service portfolio.  A CPNP
       server function is used by network operations teams.  A CPNP
       interface to invoke CPNP negotiation cycles is exposed to service
       management teams.

   4.  Service Providers can initiate connectivity provisioning requests
       towards Network Providers using CPNP.  Multiple CPNP ordering
       cycles can be initiated by a Service Provider towards multiple
       Network Providers.  Only a subset of these orders may be put into
       effect.

   5.  CPNP can be used in M2M environments to dynamically subscribe to
       M2M services (e.g., access to data retrieved by a set of sensors,
       extend sensor coverage, etc.).

Internet-Draft                    CPNP                        April 2014


   6.  A Provider offering cloud services can expose a CPNP interface to
       allow Customers to dynamically negotiate the features they want
       to subscribe to.  These features can be for instance: request
       additional storage resources, enable security filters, etc.

   7.  CDN Providers can use CPNP to extend their footprint by
       interconnecting their CDN infrastructure [RFC6770] (see
       Figure 1).

          `--'--'--'             `--'--'--'

                       Figure 1: CDN Interconnection

6.  Deployment Models

   Several CPNP deployment models can be envisaged.  Two examples are
   listed below:

   o  The Customer deploys a CPNP client while one or several CPNP
      servers are deployed by the Provider.

   o  The Customer does not enable any CPNP client.  The Provider
      maintains a Customer Order Management portal.  The Customer can
      initiate connectivity provisioning quotation orders via the
      portal; appropriate CPNP messages are then generated and sent to
      the relevant CPNP server.  In this model, both the CPNP client and
      CPNP server are under the responsibility of the same
      administrative entity (i.e., Network Provider).

   Once the negotiation of connectivity provisioning parameters is
   completed and an order has been placed by the Customer accordingly,
   the actual network provisioning operations are initiated.  The
   specification of corresponding dynamic resource allocation and policy
   enforcement schemes, as well as how CPNP servers interact with
   network provisioning functional blocks are out of the scope of this
   document.

   This document does not make any assumption about the CPNP deployment
   model either.

7.  CPNP Negotiation Model

   CPNP adopts a Quotation Order/Offer/Answer model where:

   1.  The client specifies its requirements via a Provision Quotation
       Order (PQO).

   2.  The server makes an offer to either address the requirements of
       the PQO or suggests a counter-proposal that partially addresses
       the requirements of the PQO or declines the PQO.

   3.  The client either accepts or declines the offer.

   The server may support the optional functionality to publish
   available services to the clients.  Dedicated templates can be
   defined for the purpose of service announcements.  The client will
   use these templates to initiate its CPNP negotiation cycle.

   Only one Offer/Answer stage is assumed within one single CPNP
   transaction (Section 8.6).  Nevertheless, multiple CPNP transactions
   can be undertaken by the CPNP client (see Figure 2).

8.  Protocol Overview

8.1.  Client/Server Communication

   CPNP is a client/server protocol which runs over UDP.  No permanent
   CPNP session needs to be maintained between the client and the
   server.  There is no need to run CPNP over a reliable transport mode
   because CPNP messages are acknowledged.

   The server uses CPNP_PORT (see Section 14) to bind the CPNP service.
   CPNP client sends messages to CPNP_PORT.  The same port is used as
   the source port of the request sent to the server to document service
   requirements, and must be used by the client to listen to messages
   sent by the server.

   CPNP messages can also be transported over DTLS [RFC6347].

   CPNP is independent of the IP address family.

Internet-Draft                    CPNP                        April 2014


8.2.  Server Discovery

   The CPNP client can be configured with the CPNP server using manual
   or dynamic configuration means.  For example, Providers may configure
   dedicated SRV records ([RFC2782]).

   Discussions about how the client discovers its server(s) are out of
   the scope of this document.  The document assumes a CPNP server can
   be reached by the CPNP client, thanks to some configuration means.

8.3.  Policy Configuration on the CPNP Server

   As an input to the CPNP server's decision-making process, the CPNP
   server may be connected to various external modules such as: Customer
   Profiles, Network Topology, Network Resource Management, Orders
   Repository, AAA or Network Provisioning Manager (an example is shown
   in Figure 3).

           Figure 3: Order Handling Management Functional Block

   These external modules provide inputs to the CPNP server, so that it
   can:

   o  Check whether a customer is entitled to initiate the connectivity
      provisioning quotation request.

   o  Check whether a customer is entitled to cancel the order

   o  Check whether administrative data (e.g., billing-related
      information) have been verified before starting handling the
      request

   o  Check whether network capacity is available or additional capacity
      is required

Internet-Draft                    CPNP                        April 2014


   o  Receive guidelines from network design and sales blocks (e.g.,
      cost, increase network usage, threshold of how many CPP templates
      can be processed over a given period of time as a function of the
      nature of the service to be delivered, etc.)

   o  Transfer completed orders to network provisioning blocks

   o  Etc.

   The above list of CPNP server operations is not exhaustive.

   The following order handling modes can be also configured on the
   server:

   1.  Fully automated mode: This mode does not require any action from
       the administrator when receiving a request for a service.  The
       server can execute its decision-making process related to the
       orders received and generate corresponding offers.

   2.  Administrative validation checking: Some or all server's
       operations are subject to administrative validation procedures.
       This mode requires an action from the administrator for every
       request received by the CPNP server.  CPNP methods which can be
       automatically handled or subject to one or several validation
       administrative checks can be configured on the server.

8.4.  CPNP Session

   Both the client and server maintain the following CPNP transport
   session information:

   A CPNP session is identified by the following items:

   o  IP address of the client

   o  Client's port number

   o  IP address of the server

   o  Server's port number

8.5.  Extended CPNP Session

   An extended PQO session denotes a 4-uplet defined as follows:

   o  CPNP session

   o  Incremented Sequence Number



Boucadair & Jacquenet   Expires October 25, 2014               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft                    CPNP                        April 2014


   o  Customer Order Identifier

   o  Provider Order Identifier

   o  Transaction-ID

8.6.  CPNP Transaction

   A CPNP transaction occurs between a client and a server and comprises
   all CPNP messages, from the first request sent by the client to the
   server until a final response sent by the server to the client and
   which completes the transaction.  The CPNP transaction is bound to a
   CPNP session.

   Because multiple CPNP transactions can be maintained by the CPNP
   client, the client must assign an identifier to uniquely identify a
   given transaction.  This identifier is denoted as Transaction-ID.

   The Transaction-ID must be randomly assigned be the CPNP client,
   according to the best current practice for generating random numbers
   [RFC4086] that cannot be guessed easily.  Transaction-ID is used as
   part of the validation of CPNP responses received by the client.

   Using cryptographically random Transaction-IDs provides some
   protection against session hijacking.

   Sequence Number is set in the first CPNP message by the client.  This
   number is then incremented fro each request within the same CPNP
   transaction.

8.7.  CPNP Operations

   The current CPNP operations are listed below.  They may be augmented,
   depending on the nature of some transactions or because of security
   considerations that may suggest a CPNP client/server authentication
   phase before negotiation begins.

   o  PROVISION: This operation is used to initiate a connectivity
      provisioning quotation order.  Upon receipt of a PROVISION
      request, the server may response with a PROCESSING, OFFER or a
      FAIL message.

   o  PROCESSING: This operation is used to inform the remote party the
      message was received and that the order quotation or the offer is
      being processed.

Internet-Draft                    CPNP                        April 2014


   o  OFFER: This operation is used by the server to inform the client
      about an Offer that is supposed to best accommodate the
      requirements indicated in the PROVISION message.

   o  ACCEPT: This operation is used to confirm the acceptance of an
      offer made by the server.

   o  ACK: This operation is used by the server to acknowledge the
      receipt of an ACCEPT or WITHDRAW message.

   o  DECLINE: This operation is used by a client to reject an offer
      made by the server.

   o  CANCEL: This operation is used by the client to cancel an ongoing
      connectivity provisioning quotation order.

   o  WITHDRAW: This operation is used by the client to withdraw a pre-
      negotiated connectivity provisioning order.

   o  UPDATE: This operation is used by the client to update an existing
      connectivity provisioning order.  For example, this method can be
      invoked to add a new site.  This method will trigger a new
      negotiation cycle.

   o  FAIL: This operation is used by the server when it cannot
      accommodate the requirements documented in the PQO conveyed in the
      PROVISION message.  This operation can also be used by a server to
      inform the client about an error encountered when processing the
      received message.  The message includes the status code which
      provides more information about the error.

   CPNP primitives are service-independent.  This document specifies
   objects that are required for connectivity provisioning negotiation
   (see Section 8.8).  Additional service-specific objects to be carried
   in CPNP messages can be defined in the future to accommodate other
   deployment needs.

8.8.  Connectivity Provisioning Documents

   CPNP makes use of several flavors of Connectivity Provisioning
   Documents (CPD).  These documents follow the CPP template described
   in [I-D.boucadair-connectivity-provisioning-profile].

   o  Requested Connectivity Provisioning Document: refers to the CPD
      included by a CPNP client in a PROVISION request.

   o  Offered Connectivity Provisioning Document: This document is
      included by a CPNP server in an OFFER message.  This information

Internet-Draft                    CPNP                        April 2014


      reflects the proposal of the server to accommodate all or a subset
      of the clauses depicted in a CPD.  A validity date is associated
      with the offer.

   o  Agreed Connectivity Provisioning Document: If the client accepts
      the offer, the offered CPD is included in an ACCEPT message.  This
      CPD is also included in an ACK message.

   Figure 4 shows a typical CPNP transaction and the use of Connectivity
   Provisioning Documents:

8.9.  Child Connectivity Provisioning Quotation Orders

   If the server detects network resources from another Network Provider
   need to be allocated in order to accommodate the requirements
   described in a PQO (e.g., context of an inter-domain VPN service
   where additional PE router resources need to be allocated), the
   server may generate child PQOs to request the appropriate network
   provisioning operations (see Figure 5).  In such situation, the
   server behaves as a CPNP client.  The server associates the parent
   order with its child PQOs.  This is typically achieved by locally
   adding the reference of the child PQO to the parent order.

8.10.  State Management

   Both the client and the server maintain repositories to store ongoing
   orders.  How these repositories are maintained is deployment-
   specific.  It is out of scope of this document to elaborate on such
   considerations.Timestamps are also logged to track state change.
   Tracking may be needed for various reasons (including regulatory
   ones).

8.10.1.  On the Client Side

   The following lists the states which can be associated with a given
   order on the client's side:

   o  Created: when the order has been created.  It is not handled by
      the client until the administrator allows to process it.
   o  AwaitingProcessing: when the administrator ordered to process an
      order and this order is not handled yet.
   o  PQOSent: when the PQO has been sent to the server.
   o  ServerProcessing: when the server has confirmed the receipt of the
      order.
   o  OfferReceived: when an offer has been received from the server.
   o  OfferProcessing: when a received offer is currently processed by
      the client.
   o  AcceptSent: when the client confirmed the offer to the server.
   o  AcceptAck: when the offer is acknowledged by the server.
   o  Cancelled: when the order has failed or has been cancelled.

   The following lists the states which can be associated with a given
   order on the server's side:

   o  PQOReceived: when the connectivity provisioning quotation order
      request has been received from the client.
   o  AwaitingProcessing: when the order request is being processed by
      the server.  An action from the server administrator may be
      needed.
   o  OfferProposed: when the request has been successfully handled and
      an offer has been sent to the requesting client.
   o  ProcessingReceived: when the server received a PROCESSING for an
      offer sent to the client.
   o  AcceptReceived: when the server received a confirm for the offer
      from the client.
   o  AcceptAck: when the server acknowledged the offer to the client.
   o  Cancelled: when the order request has failed or has been
      cancelled.  Associate resources must be released in the latter
      case.
   o  ChildCreated: when a child PQO has been created because resources
      from another network provider are needed.
   o  ChildPQOSent: when a child PQO has been sent to another server.
   o  ChildServerProcessing: when a child PQO is currently processed by
      another server.
   o  ChildOfferReceived: when an offer has been received to a child
      PQO.
   o  ChildOfferProcessing: when a received offer is currently
      processed.
   o  ChildAcceptSent: when the child offer is confirmed to another
      server.
   o  ChildAcceptAck: when the child offer is acknowledged by another
      server.

8.11.  CPNP Timers

   CPNP adopts a simple retransmission procedure which relies on a
   retransmission timer denoted as RETRANS_TIMER and maximum retry
   threshold.  The use of RETRANS_TIMER and maximum retry threshold are
   described in Section 11.

   The response timer (RESPONSE_TIMER) is the maximum time, defined in
   seconds, between a connectivity provisioning quotation order request
   sent to the server and the corresponding response.  If this timer is
   exceeded, the corresponding quotation order is cancelled by the
   client.  Relevant CANCEL messages are generated accordingly.

   An offer expiration timer (EXPIRE_TIMER) represents the maximum time,
   defined in minutes, after which an offer made by the server will be
   invalid.

9.  CPNP Objects

   This section defines CPNP objects using the RBNF format defined at
   [RFC5511].

   This document focuses on connectivity provisioning objects;
   additional Information Elements can be defined in the future.

9.1.  Attributes

9.1.1.  CUSTOMER_ORDER_IDENTIFIER

   CUSTOMER_ORDER_IDENTIFIER is an identifier which is assigned by a
   client to identify an order.  This identifier must be unique.  Rules
   for assigning this identifier are specific to the client.  The value
   of CUSTOMER_ORDER_IDENTIFIER is included in all CPNP messages.

   The server handles CUSTOMER_ORDER_IDENTIFIER as an opaque value.

9.1.2.  PROVIDER_ORDER_IDENTIFIER

   PROVIDER_ORDER_IDENTIFIER is an identifier which is assigned by a
   server to identify an order.  This identifier must be unique to the
   server.  Rules for assigning this identifier are specific to the
   server.  The value of PROVIDER_ORDER_IDENTIFIER is included in all
   CPNP message, except PROVISION messages.

   The client handles PROVIDER_ORDER_IDENTIFIER as an opaque value.

Internet-Draft                    CPNP                        April 2014


9.1.3.  TRANSACTION_ID

   This object conveys the Transaction-ID introduced in Section 8.6.

9.1.4.  SEQUENCE_NUMBER

   Sequence Number is a number that is incremented on every new CPNP
   message within a CPNP transaction.  This number is used to avoid
   reply attacks.

9.1.5.  NONCE

   NONCE is a random value assigned by the CPNP server.  It is
   RECOMMENDED to assign unique NONCE values for each order.

   NONCE is mandatory to be included in subsequent CPNP client
   operations such as: withdraw an existing order or update an order.

   If the NONCE validation checks fail, the server rejects the request
   with a FAIL message including the appropriate failure reason code.

9.1.6.  EXPECTED_RESPONSE_DATE

   This attribute indicates the date by when the client is expecting to
   receive a response from the server.  If no offer is received by then,
   the client will consider the quotation order as rejected.

   EXPECTED_RESPONSE_DATE follows date format specified in [RFC1123].

9.1.7.  EXPECTED_OFFER_DATE

   This attribute indicates the date by when the server is expecting to
   make an offer to the client.  If no offer is received by then, the
   client will consider the order as rejected.

   EXPECTED_OFFER_DATE follows date format specified in [RFC1123].

9.1.8.  VALIDITY_DATE

   This attribute indicates the date of a validity of an offer made by
   the server.  If the offer is not accepted before this date expires,
   the server will consider the client has rejected the offer; the
   server will silently clear this order.

   VALIDITY_DATE follows date format specified in [RFC1123].

9.1.9.  CONNECTIVITY_PROVISIONING_DOCUMENT

   The RBNF format of the Connectivity Provisioning Document is shown
   below:

   <CONNECTIVITY_PROVISIONING_DOCUMENT> ::=
                              <Connectivity Provisioning Component> ...
   <Connectivity Provisioning Component> ::=
                              <CONNECTIVITY_PROVISIONING_PROFILE> ...
   <CONNECTIVITY_PROVISIONING_PROFILE> ::=

                              <Availability>
                              <CAPACITY>
                              <Traffic Isolation>
                              <Conformance Traffic>
                              <Flow Identification>
                              <Overall Traffic Guarantees>
                              <Routing and Forwarding>
                              <Activation Means>

                              <Notifications>
   <Customer Nodes Map> ::=  <Customer Node> ...
   <Customer Node> ::=  <IDENTIFIER>
                        <LINK_IDENTIFIER>
                        <LOCALISATION>

9.1.10.  Information Elements

   An Information Element is an optional object which can be included in
   a CPNP message.

9.1.10.1.  Customer Description

   The client may include administrative information such as:

   o  Name
   o  Contact Information

   The format of this Information Element is as follows:

   <Customer Description> ::= <NAME> <Contact Information>
   <Contact Information> ::=  <EMAIL_ADDRESS> [<POSTAL_ADDRESS>]
                              [<TELEPHONE_NUMBER> ...]

9.1.10.2.  Provider Description

   The server may include administrative information in an offer such
   as:

   o  Name
   o  AS Number
   o  Contact Information

   The format of this Information Element is as follows:

   <Provider Description> ::= <NAME><Contact Information>[<AS_NUMBER>]

9.1.10.3.  Negotiation Options

   The client may include some negotiation options such as:

   o  Cost: the client may include an empty or a preferred COST
      attribute to request the cost from the server.  The server will
      provide the cost information in the response.
   o  Setup purpose: A client may request to setup a connectivity only
      for testing purposes during a limited period.  The order can be
      extended to become permanent if the client was satisfied during
      the test period.  This operation is achieved using UPDATE method.

   Other negotiation options may be defined in the future.

   The format of this Information Element is as follows:

   <Negotiation Options> ::= [<COST>][<PURPOSE>]

9.2.  Operation Messages

   This section specifies the RBNF format of CPNP operation messages.

9.2.1.  PROVISION

   The format of PROVISION message is shown below:

   <PROVISION Message> ::= <VERSION>
                           <METHOD_CODE>
                           <SEQUENCE_NUMBER>
                           <TRANSACTION_ID>
                           <CUSTOMER_ORDER_IDENTIFIER>
                           [<EXPECTED_RESPONSE_DATE>]
                           <CONNECTIVITY_PROVISIONING_DOCUMENT>
                           [<INFORMATION_ELEMENT>...]

Internet-Draft                    CPNP                        April 2014


   A PROVISION message must include an order identifier which is
   generated by the client.  Because several orders can be issued to
   several servers, the PROVISION message must also include a
   Transaction-ID.  The message may include an EXPECTED_RESPONSE_DATE
   which indicates by when the client is expecting to receive an offer
   from the server.  PROVISION message must also include a requested
   connectivity provisioning document.

   When the client sends the PROVISION message to the server, the state
   of the order changes to "PQOSent".

9.2.2.  PROCESSING

   The format of PROCESSING Message is shown below:

   <PROCESSING Message> ::= <VERSION>
                            <METHOD_CODE>
                            <SEQUENCE_NUMBER>
                            <TRANSACTION_ID>
                            <CUSTOMER_ORDER_IDENTIFIER>
                            <PROVIDER_ORDER_IDENTIFIER>
                            [<EXPECTED_OFFER_DATE>]

   Upon receipt of a PROVISION message, the server proceeds with parsing
   rules (see Section 10).  If no error is encountered, the server
   generates a PROCESSING response to the client to indicate the PQO has
   been received and it is being processed.  The server must generate an
   order identifier which identifies the order in its local order
   repository.  The server MUST copy the content of
   CUSTOMER_ORDER_IDENTIFIER and TRANSACTION_ID fields as conveyed in
   the PROVISION message.  The server may include an EXPECTED_OFFER_DATE
   by when it expects to make an offer to the client.

   Upon receipt of a PROCESSING message, the client verifies whether it
   has issued a PQO to that server and which contains the
   CUSTOMER_ORDER_IDENTIFIER and TRANSACTION_ID.  If no such PQO is
   found, the PROCESSING message is silently ignored.  If a PQO is
   found, the client may check if it accepts the EXPECTED_OFFER_DATE and
   then, it changes to state of the order to "ServerProcessing".

9.2.3.  OFFER

   The format of OFFER message is shown below:

   <OFFER Message> ::= <VERSION>
                       <METHOD_CODE>
                       <SEQUENCE_NUMBER>
                       <TRANSACTION_ID>

                       <CUSTOMER_ORDER_IDENTIFIER>
                       <PROVIDER_ORDER_IDENTIFIER>
                       <NONCE>
                       <VALIDITY_DATE>
                       <CONNECTIVITY_PROVISIONING_DOCUMENT>
                       [<INFORMATION_ELEMENT>...]

   The server answers with an OFFER message to a PROVISION request
   received from the client.  The offer will be considered as rejected
   by the client if no confirmation (ACCEPT message sent by the client)
   is received by the server before the expiration of the validity date.

9.2.4.  ACCEPT

   The format of ACCEPT message is shown below:

   <ACCEPT Message> ::=  <VERSION>
                         <METHOD_CODE>
                         <SEQUENCE_NUMBER>
                         <TRANSACTION_ID>
                         <CUSTOMER_ORDER_IDENTIFIER>
                         <PROVIDER_ORDER_IDENTIFIER>
                         <NONCE>
                         <CONNECTIVITY_PROVISIONING_DOCUMENT>
                         [<INFORMATION_ELEMENT>...]

   This message is used by a client to confirm the acceptance of an
   offer received from a server.  The fields of this message are copied
   from the received OFFER message.

9.2.5.  ACK

   The format of ACK message is shown below:

   <ACK Message> ::=  <VERSION>
                    <METHOD_CODE>
                    <SEQUENCE_NUMBER>
                    <TRANSACTION_ID>
                    <CUSTOMER_ORDER_IDENTIFIER>
                    <PROVIDER_ORDER_IDENTIFIER>
                    <CONNECTIVITY_PROVISIONING_DOCUMENT>
                    [<INFORMATION_ELEMENT>...]

   This message is issued by the server to close a CPNP transaction.  In
   particular, this message is sent as a response to an ACCEPT,
   WITHDRAW, DECLINE, or CANCEL message.  The ACK message must include
   the copy of the Connectivity Provisioning Document as stored by the
   server, in particular:

   o  A copy of the requested/offered CPD is included by the server if
      it successfully handled a CANCEL message.
   o  A copy of the updated CPD is included by the server if it
      successfully handled an UPDATE message.
   o  A copy of the offered CPD is included by the server if it
      successfully handled an ACCEPT message in the context of a
      PROVISION transaction.
   o  An empty CPD is included by the server if it successfully handled
      a DECLINE message.

9.2.6.  DECLINE

   The format of DECLINE message is shown below:

   <DECLINE Message> ::=  <VERSION>
                        <METHOD_CODE>
                        <SEQUENCE_NUMBER>
                        <TRANSACTION_ID>
                        <CUSTOMER_ORDER_IDENTIFIER>
                        <PROVIDER_ORDER_IDENTIFIER>

   The client can issue a DECLINE message to reject an offer.
   CUSTOMER_ORDER_IDENTIFIER, PROVIDER_ORDER_IDENTIFIER and
   TRANSACTION_ID are used by the server as keys to find the
   corresponding order.  If an order matches, the server changes the
   state of this order to "Cancelled" and then returns an ACK with a
   copy of the requested CPD to the requesting client.

   If no order is found, the server returns a FAIL message to the
   requesting client.

   A flow example is shown in Figure 8.

9.2.7.  CANCEL

   The format of CANCEL message is shown below:

   <CANCEL Message> ::= <VERSION>
                        <METHOD_CODE>
                        <SEQUENCE_NUMBER>
                        <TRANSACTION_ID>
                        <CUSTOMER_ORDER_IDENTIFIER>
                        [<CONNECTIVITY_PROVISIONING_DOCUMENT>]

   The client can issue a CANCEL message at any stage during the CPNP
   negotiation process.  CUSTOMER_ORDER_IDENTIFIER and TRANSACTION_ID
   are used by the server as keys to find the corresponding order.  If
   an order matches, the server changes the state of this order to
   "Cancelled" and then returns an ACK with a copy of the requested CPD
   to the requesting client.

   If no order is found, the server returns a FAIL message to the
   requesting client.

9.2.8.  WITHDRAW

   The format of WITHDRAW message is shown below:

   <WITHDRAW Message> ::= <VERSION>
                          <METHOD_CODE>
                          <SEQUENCE_NUMBER>
                          <TRANSACTION_ID>
                          <CUSTOMER_ORDER_IDENTIFIER>
                          <PROVIDER_ORDER_IDENTIFIER>
                          <NONCE>
                          [<CONNECTIVITY_PROVISIONING_DOCUMENT>]

   The CPNP must include the same CUSTOMER_ORDER_IDENTIFIER,
   PROVIDER_ORDER_IDENTIFIER, and NONCE as those used when creating the
   order.

   Upon receipt of a WITHDRAW message, the server checks whether an
   order matching the request is found.  If an order is found, the state
   of the order is changed to "Cancelled" and an ACK message including
   an Empty CPD is returned to the requesting client.  If no order is
   found, the server returns a FAIL message to the requesting client.

9.2.9.  UPDATE

   The format of UPDATE message is shown below:

   <UPDATE Message> ::= <VERSION>
                        <METHOD_CODE>
                        <SEQUENCE_NUMBER>
                        <TRANSACTION_ID>
                        <CUSTOMER_ORDER_IDENTIFIER>
                        <PROVIDER_ORDER_IDENTIFIER>

                        <EXPECTED_RESPONSE_DATE>
                        <CONNECTIVITY_PROVISIONING_DOCUMENT>
                        [<INFORMATION_ELEMENT>...]

   This message is sent by the CPNP client to update an existing
   connectivity provisioning agreement.  The CPNP must include the same
   CUSTOMER_ORDER_IDENTIFIER, PROVIDER_ORDER_IDENTIFIER, and NONCE as
   those used when creating the order.  The CPNP client includes a new
   CPD which integrates the requested modifications.  A new
   Transaction_ID must be assigned by the client.

   Upon receipt of an UPDATE message, the server checks whether an
   order, having state "Completed", matches CUSTOMER_ORDER_IDENTIFIER,
   PROVIDER_ORDER_IDENTIFIER, and NONCE.

   o  If no order is found, the CPNP server generates a FAIL error with
      the appropriate error code.
   o  If an order is found, the server checks whether it can honor the
      request:

      *  A FAIL message is sent to the client if the server cannot honor
         the request.  The client may initiate a new PQO negotiation
         cycle.
      *  An OFFER message including the updated connectivity
         provisioning document is sent to the client.  For example, the
         server maintains an order for provisioning a VPN service that
         connects sites A, B and C. If the client sends an UPDATE

         message to remove site C, only sites A and B will be included
         in the OFFER sent by the server to the requesting client.

   A flow chart that illustrates the use of UPDATE operation is shown in
   Figure 10.

9.2.10.  FAIL

   The format of FAIL message is shown below:

   <FAIL Message> ::= <VERSION>
                      <METHOD_CODE>
                      <SEQUENCE_NUMBER>

                      <PROVIDER_ORDER_IDENTIFIER>
                      <STATUS_CODE>

   This message is sent in the following cases:

   o  The server can not honor an order received from the client (i.e.,
      received in a PROVISION or UPDATE request).
   o  The server encounters an error when processing a CPNP request
      received from the client.

   The status code indicates the error code.  The following codes are
   currently supported; other codes will be defined in future versions
   of the document:

      1 (Validation Error): The message can not be validated (see
      Section 10).
      2 (Authentication Required): the request cannot be handled because
      authentication is required.
      3 (Authorization Required): : the request cannot be handled
      because authorization failed.

      4 (Administratively prohibited): the request can not be handled
      because of administrative policies.
      5 (Out of Resources): the request can not be honored because there
      is not enough capacity.
      6 (Network Presence): the request can not be honored because there
      is no network presence.

11.  Theory of Operation

   Both CPNP client and server proceeds to message validation checks as
   specified in Section 10.

11.1.  Client Behavior

11.1.1.  Order Negotiation Cycle

   To place a connectivity provisioning quotation order, the client
   initiates first a local order object identified by a unique
   identifier assigned by the client.  The state of the quotation order
   is set to "Created".  The client then generates a PROVISION request
   which includes the assigned identifier, possibly an Expected Response
   Date, a Transaction-ID and a Requested Connectivity Provisioning
   Document.  The client may include additional Information Elements
   such as Negotiation Options.

   The client may be configured to not enforce negotiation checks on
   EXPECTED_OFFER_DATE; if so no EXPECTED_RESP_TIMER attribute (or




Boucadair & Jacquenet   Expires October 25, 2014               [Page 33]

Internet-Draft                    CPNP                        April 2014


   EXPECTED_RESP_TIMER set to infinite) should be included in the
   quotation order.

   Once the request is sent to the server, the state of the request is
   set to "PQOSent" and a timer, if a response time is included in the
   quotation order, is set to the expiration date as included in the
   PROVISION request.  The client also maintains a copy of the extended
   transport session details used to generate the PROVISION request.
   The CPNP client must listen on the same port number that it used to
   send the PROVISION request.

   If no answer is received from the server before the retransmission
   timer expires (i.e., RETRANS_TIMER), the client proceeds to
   retransmission until maximum retry is reached (i.e., 3 times).  The
   same sequence number is used for retransmitted packets.

   If a FAIL message is received, the client may decide to issue another
   (corrected) request towards the same server, cancel the local order,
   or contact another server.  The behavior of the client depends on the
   error code returned by the server in the FAIL message.

   If a PROCESSING message matching the CPNP transport session is
   received, the client updates the CPNP session with the
   PROVIDER_ORDER_IDENTIFIER information.  If the client does not accept
   the expected offer date that may have been indicated in the
   PROCESSING message, the client may decide to cancel the quotation
   order.  If the client accepts the EXPECTED_OFFER_DATE, it changes the
   state of the order to "ServerProcessing" and sets a timer to the
   value of EXPECTED_OFFER_DATE.  If no offer is made before the timer
   expires, the client changes the state of the order to "Cancelled".

   If an OFFER message matching the extended CPNP session is received,
   the client checks if a PROCESSING message having the same
   PROVIDER_ORDER_IDENTIFIER has been received from the server.  If a
   PROCESSING message was already received for the same order but the
   PROVIDER_ORDER_IDENTIFIER does not match the identifier included in
   the OFFER message, the client ignores silently the message.  If a
   PROCESSING message having the same PROVIDER_ORDER_IDENTIFIER was
   already received and matches the CPNP transaction identifier, the
   client changes the state of the order to "OfferReceived" and sets a
   timer to the value of VALIDITY_DATE indicated in the OFFER message.

   If an offer is received from the server (i.e., as documented in an
   OFFER message), the client may accept or reject the offer.  The
   client accepts the offer by generating an ACCEPT message which
   confirms that the client agrees to subscribe to the offer documented
   in the OFFER message; the state of the order is passed to
   "AcceptSent".  The transaction is terminated if an ACK message is

Internet-Draft                    CPNP                        April 2014


   received from the server.  If no ACK is received from the server, the
   client proceeds with the re-transmission of the ACCEPT message.

   The client may also decide to reject the offer by sending a DECLINE
   message.  The state of the order is set by the client to "Cancelled".
   If an offer is not acceptable by the client, the client may decide to
   contact a new server or submit another order to the same server.
   Guidelines to issue an updated order or terminate the negotiation are
   specific to the client.

11.1.2.  Order Withdrawal Cycle

   A client may withdraw a completed order.  This is achieved by issuing
   a WITHDRAW message.  This message must include Customer Order
   Identifier, Provider Identifier and Nonce returned during the order
   negotiation cycle specified in Section 11.1.1.

   If no ACK is received from the server, the client proceeds with the
   re-transmission of the message.

11.1.3.  Order Update Cycle

   A client may update a completed order.  This is achieved by issuing
   an UPDATE message.  This message must include Customer Order
   Identifier, Provider Order Identifier and Nonce returned during the
   order negotiation cycle specified in Section 11.1.1.  The client must
   include in the UPDATE message an updated CPD with the requested
   changes.

   Subsequent messages exchange is similar to what is documented in
   Section 11.1.1.

11.2.  Server Behavior

11.2.1.  Order Processing

   Upon receipt of a PROVISION message from a client, the server sets a
   CPNP session, stores Transaction-ID and generates a Provider Order
   Identifier.  Once preliminary validation checks are completed (
   Section 10), the server may return a PROCESSING message to notify the
   client the quotation order is received and it is under processing;
   the server may include an expected offer date to notify the client by
   when an offer will be proposed.  An order with state
   "AwaitingProcessing" is created by the server.  The server runs its
   decision-making process to decide which offer it can make to honor
   the received order.  The offer should be made before the expected
   offer date expires.




Boucadair & Jacquenet   Expires October 25, 2014               [Page 35]

Internet-Draft                    CPNP                        April 2014


   If the server cannot honor the request, it sends backs a FAIL message
   with the appropriate error code.

   If the server can honor the request, it creates an OFFER message.
   The server must indicate the Transaction-ID, Customer Order
   Identifier as indicated in the PROVISION message, and the Provider
   Order Identifier generated for this order.  The server must also
   include Nonce and the offered Connectivity Provisioning Document.
   The server includes an offer validity date as well.  Once sent to the
   client, the server changes the state of the order to "OfferSent" and
   a timer set to the validity date is initiated.

   If the server determines that additional network resources from
   another network provider are needed to accommodate a quotation order,
   it will create child PQO(s) and will behave as a CPNP client to
   negotiate child PQO(s) with possible partnering providers (see
   Figure 5).

   If no PROCESSING, ACCEPT or DECLINE message is received before the
   expiry of the RETRANS_TIMER, the server re-sends the same offer to
   the client.  This procedure is repeated until maximum retry is
   reached.

   If an ACCEPT message is received before the offered validity date
   expires, the server proceeds with validation checks as specified in
   Section 10.  The state of the corresponding order is passed to
   "AcceptReceived".  The server sends back an ACK message to terminate
   the order processing cycle.

   If a CANCEL/DECLINE message is received, the server proceeds with the
   cancellation of the order.  The state of the order is then passed to
   "Cancelled".

11.2.2.  Order Withdrawal

   A client may withdraw a completed order by issuing a WITHDRAW
   message.  Upon receipt of a WITHDRAW message, the server proceeds
   with the validation checks, as specified in Section 10.

   o  If the checks fail, a FAIL message is sent back to the client with
      the appropriate error code.
   o  If the checks succeed, the server clears the clauses of the
      Connectivity Provisioning Document, changes the state of the order
      to "Cancelled", and sends back an ACK message with an Empty
      Connectivity Provisioning Document.

Internet-Draft                    CPNP                        April 2014


11.2.3.  Order Update

   A client may update an order by issuing an UPDATE message.  Upon
   receipt of an UPDATE message, the server proceeds with the validation
   checks as specified in Section 10.

   o  If the checks fail, a FAIL message is sent back to the client with
      the appropriate error code.
   o  Subsequent messages exchange is similar to what is specified in
      Section 11.1.1.  The server should generate a new Nonce value to
      be included in the offer made to the client.

12.  Operational Guidelines

12.1.  Logging on the CPNP Server

   The CPNP server SHOULD be configurable to log various events and
   associated information.  Such information includes:

   o  Client's IP Address
   o  Any event change (e.g., new quotation order, offer sent, order
      confirm, order cancellation, order withdraw, etc.)
   o  Timestamp

12.2.  Business Guidelines & Objectives

   The CPNP server can operate in the following modes:

   1.  Fully automated mode: The CPNP server is provisioned with a set
       of business guidelines and objectives that will be used as an
       input to the decision-making process.  The CPNP server will
       service received orders that falls into these business
       guidelines; otherwise requests will be escalated to an
       administrator that will formally validate/invalidate an order
       request.  The set of policies to be configured to the CPNP server
       are specific to each administrative entity managing a CPNP
       server.
   2.  Administrative-based mode: This mode assumes some or all CPNP
       server' operations are subject to a formal administrative
       validation.  CPNP events will trigger appropriate validation
       requests that will be forwarded to the contact person(s) or
       department which is responsible for validating the orders.
       Administrative validation messages are relayed using another
       protocol (e.g., SMTP) or a dedicated tool.

   Business guidelines are local to each administrative entity.  How
   validation requests are presented to an administrator are out of

   scope of this document; each administrative entity may decide the
   appropriate mechanism to enable for that purpose.

13.  Security Considerations

   Means to defend the server against denial-of-service attacks must be
   enabled.  For example, access control lists (ACLs) can be enforced on
   the client, the server or the network in between, to allow a trusted
   client to communicate with a trusted server.

   The client and the server should be mutually authenticated.  Out of
   band mechanisms can be used instead of integrating them into CPNP.

   The client must silently discard CPNP responses received from unknown
   CPNP servers.  The use of a randomly generated Transaction-ID makes
   it hard to forge a response from a server with a spoofed IP address
   belonging the legitimate CPNP server.  Furthermore, CPNP messages
   from the server must also include correct identifiers of the orders.
   Two order identifiers are used: one generated by the client and the
   second one is generated by the server.

   Only authorized clients must be able to modify existing CPNP orders.
   The use of a randomly generated Nonce by the server makes it hard to
   modify an order on behalf of a third-party.

   The use of sequence numbers protects the CPNP server from replay
   attacks.

   The Provider must enforce means to protect privacy-related
   information captured in a CPP documents exchanged using CPNP messages
   [RFC6462].  In particular, this information must not be revealed to
   external parties without the consent of Customers.  Providers should
   enforce policies to make Customer fingerprinting more difficult to
   achieve.  For more discussion about privacy, refer to
   [RFC6462][RFC6973].

14.  IANA Considerations

   Authors of the document request IANA to assign a UDP port for CPNP.

   A registry for CPNP methods should be created.  The following codes
   are reserved:

   1:   PROVISION
   2:   PROCESSING
   3:   OFFER
   4:   ACCEPT
   5:   DECLINE

   are reserved:

   1:  Message Validation Error
   2:  Authentication Required
   3:  Authorization Failed
   4:  Administratively prohibited
   5:  Out of Resources
