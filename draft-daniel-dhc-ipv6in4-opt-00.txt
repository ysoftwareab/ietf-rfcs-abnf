  Abstract 
      
     This document provides a mechanism by which the DHCPv4 servers can     
     provide information about the configured IPv6-in-IPv4 tunnel     
     end-points.  The IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack nodes can use this     
     information to set up a configured tunnel to the tunnel end-point     
     to obtain IPv6 connectivity.

  1. Introduction 
      
     In the initial deployment of IPv6, the IPv6 nodes may need to     
     communicate with the other IPv6 nodes via IPv4 tunnel service. The 
     connectivity can be obtained by setting up an IPv6-in-IPv4 
     configured tunnel between a client and a tunnel router. 
      
     This document defines a new option by which the DHCPv4 [1] server 
     can notify the client with the list of end-points of the possible 
     configured tunnels. 
      
      
  2. Requirements 
      
     The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,      
     SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this      
     document, are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [2]. 
      
      
  3. Configured Tunnel End Point Option 
      
     This option specifies the configured tunnel end-points that client      
     should use when discovering the IPv4 address of the ISP's tunnel      
     router somehow via the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol.  
            
     Once the IPv4 address has been learned, it is configured as the      
     tunnel end-point for the configured IPv6-over-IPv4 tunnel.    
      
      
     The format of the Configured Tunnel End Point Option is shown as      
     below;

     The code for this option is TBD.  The minimum length of this option      
     is 4, and the length MUST be a multiple of 4.  
            
            
          Code            Length             CTEP Order in Sequence 
      0                   1                   2                   3 
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
     |  OPTION_CTEP  |     Len       |           CTEP Addr1          | 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
     |        CTEP Addr 1            |           CTEP Addr 2         | 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
     |        CTEP Addr 2            |... 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
      
      
     In the above diagram, CTEP Addr is 32-bit integers corresponding      
     to DHCP options which specify the IP addresses of different      
     configured tunnel end-points. 
      
      
  4. Security Considerations 
      
     A rouge DHCP server can issue invalid or incorrect configured tunnel      
     end-points.  This may cause denial of service due to unreachability     
     or makes the client to reach incorrect destination. 
      
     The latter has very severe security issues as the tunnel end-point      
     is on-the-path towards all the IPv6 destinations, and can trivially      
     act as a man-in-the-middle attacker. 
      
      
  5. IANA Considerations 
      
     IANA is requested to an assign value for the Configured Tunnel End 
     Point option code in accordance with RFC 2939 [3]. 
      
     Option Name           Value     Described in 
     OPTION_CTEP            TBD        Section 3.
