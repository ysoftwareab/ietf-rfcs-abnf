                Virtualization YANG Servise Model (VYSM)
                    draft-shytyi-netmod-vysm-00.txt

Abstract

   This document provides a specification of the Network Function
   Virtualization (NFV) YANG service model.  The NFV service module
   serves as a base framework for managing an universal Customer-
   Premises Equipment (uCPE) NFV subsystem from the Orchestrator.

1.  Introduction

   Network Function Virtualization is a technology that allows to
   virtualize the network services running on dedicaded hardware.  This
   technology became a base for universal Customer-Premises
   Equipment(uCPE).  The uCPE - is x86 universal harware (whitebox) that
   has a hypervisor.  In other words, uCPE is a host that may run
   multiple Virtual Machines with guest OSs.  Each Guest OS may
   represent a Physical Network Function.  To manage from an
   Orchestrator the Network Function Virtualization Infrastructure
   inside the uCPE, the VNF YANG service model (VYSM) was developed.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Link - is an entity that enables link layer communication of nodes.

   Port - node connector to the link.

3.  NFV service module Tree Diagram overview

   This section provides an overview of of the NFV service MAY be made
   with "pyang" utility.  The figure below presents the Tree diagram of
   the NFV service module.
