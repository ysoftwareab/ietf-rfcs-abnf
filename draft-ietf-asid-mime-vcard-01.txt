Abstract

   This memo defines a directory information profile for a white pages
   person, to be carried in an application/directory MIME Content-Type.
   The profile consists of type definitions (e.g., for name and email
   address) and the corresponding format of values that each type is
   allowed to contain.

1. Overview

   The application/directory MIME Content-Type defined in [MIME-DIR] is
   used for representing directory information in MIME format. It
   defines a general framework for carrying _type: value_ style
   information in the body of a MIME message, but does not define
   specific types or values. This document defines a profile containing
   the types and corresponding value formats for representing
   information about an electronic business card. The profile reflects
   the vCard (The Electronic Business Card) schema defined in [VCARD].

1.1 The vCard Profile

   The profile is defined as follows, using the profile registration
   template from Section 8 of [MIME-DIR].

                vCard Application/Directory Content Type


   Profile name: vcard

   Profile purpose: To hold vcard information about an electronic
   business card.

   Profile types: BEGIN, END, FN, N, PHOTO, BDAY, ADR, LABEL, TEL,
   EMAIL, MAILER, TZ, GEO, TITLE, ROLE, LOGO, AGENT, ORG, NOTE, REV,
   SOUND, URL, UID, VERSION, KEY

   Profile special notes: The content entity must begin with the type
   BEGIN and end with the type END. There is no other ordering
   limitations on types within the content entity.

   The default transfer encoding for the vCard profile is _8BIT_. The
   default transfer encoding can be overridden for an individual type
   value by using the _ENCODING_ type parameter. The parameter value can
   be reset to either _7BIT_, _BASE64_ or _QUOTED-PRINTABLE_. This type
   parameter may be used on any profile type.

   The usual line-folding technique described in [MIME-DIR] can be used
   to represent type values consisting of long lines of text. For
   example, individual lines in the content entity are delimited by the
   [RFC 822] line break, which is a CRLF sequence (ASCII decimal 13,
   followed by ASCII decimal 10). Long lines of text can be split into a
   multiple-line representation using the RFC 822 _folding_ technique.
   That is, wherever there may be linear white space (NOT simply LWSP-
   chars), a CRLF immediately followed by at least one LWSP-char may
   instead be inserted. For example the line:

   NOTE:This is a long note that exists on a long line.

   Can be represented as:

   NOTE:This is a long note
    that exists on a long line.

   The process of moving from this folded multiple-line representation
   of a type value to its single line representation is called
   _unfolding_. Unfolding is accomplished by regarding CRLF immediately
   followed by a LWSP-char as equivalent to the LWSP-char.

   It is recommended that folding be limited to higher-level syntactic
   breaks in structured components of the property definition.

   A formatted text line break in a type value, MUST also be specified
   by a (RFC 822) line break, which is a CRLF sequence. However, since
   the CRLF sequence is used to delimit a line, type values with
   formatted line breaks (i.e., multiple lines) MUST be encoded using an
   alternate encoding of either Quoted-Printable or Base64, as defined
   in [RFC 1521].

   For example, in the Quoted-Printable encoding the multiple lines of
   formatted text are separated with a Quoted-Printable CRLF sequence of
   _=0D_ followed by _=0A_ followed by a Quoted-Printable soft line

                vCard Application/Directory Content Type


   break sequence of _=_. Quoted-Printable lines of text must also be
   limited to less than 76 characters. The 76 characters does not
   include the CRLF [RFC 822] line break sequence. For example a
   multiple line LABEL value of:

   Mr. John Q. Public
   123 Main Street
   Any Town, CA 12345

   Would be represented in a Quoted-Printable encoding as:

   LABEL;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:Mr. John Q. Public=0D=0A=
   123 Mail Street=0D=0A=
   Any Town, CA   12345

   Compound property values are delimited by a field delimiter,
   specified by the SEMI-COLON character (ASCII decimal 59). A SEMI-
   COLON in a component of a compound property value must be escaped
   with a Backslash character

   The default character set is _UTF-8_. The default character set can
   be overridden for an individual type value by using the _CHARSET_
   type parameter. This type parameter may be used on any profile type.
   However, the use of this parameter on some profile types may not make
   sense.

   The default language is _en-US_ (US English). The default language
   can be overridden for an individual type value by using the
   _LANGUAGE_ type parameter. This type parameter may be used on any
   profile type. However, the use of this parameter on some profile
   types may not make sense.

   The default location of the type values is inline with the profile
   type. However, for some profile types, such as those that specify
   multimedia values, it is efficient to organize the type value as a
   separate MIME entity. The type parameter _VALUE_ can be specified to
   override the _INLINE_ location of the type value. The type value can
   be specified as being located in a separate MIME entity with the
   _CID_ value. In this case, the type value is the Content-ID for the
   MIME entity containing the type value. In addition, the type value
   can be specified as being located out on the network within some
   Internet resource with the _URL_ value. In this case, the type value
   is the Uniform Resource Locator for the Internet resource containing
   the type value. This type parameter may be used on any profile type.
   However, the use of this parameter on some profile types may not make
   sense.

   This profile supports the type grouping mechanism defined in [MIME-
   DIR]. Grouping of related profile types is a useful technique to
   communicate common semantics concerning the properties of a vCard
   object.

   Intended usage: COMMON

                vCard Application/Directory Content Type


   The associated type definitions follow, using the type registration
   template from Section 9 of [MIME-DIR].

1.3 Delimiter Profile Types

   The following profile types are used to delimit the vCard data within
   the content type. These types are necessary to completely define the
   content type so that it might be identified as a vCard object when
   the content type is in a persistent form outside of a MIME message.

1.3.1 BEGIN Type Definition

   To: ietf-mime-direct@umich.edu

   Subject: Registration of application/directory MIME type BEGIN

   Type name: BEGIN

   Type purpose: To delimit the beginning of the vCard content data.

   Type encoding: text.

   Type special notes: The only valid value is _vCard_.

   Type example:

                BEGIN:vCard

1.3.2 END Type Definition

   To: ietf-mime-direct@umich.edu

   Subject: Registration of application/directory MIME type END

   Type name: END

   Type purpose: To delimit the end of the vCard content data.

   Type encoding: text.

   Type special notes: The type either has no value or has the value
   _vCard_.

   Type example:

                END: vCard

1.4 Identification Profile Types

   These profile types are concerned with information associated with
   the identification and naming of the individual or resource
   associated with the vCard object.

   Type special notes: The value is intended to be used as a formatted
   string corresponding to how the name of the individual or resource
   associated with the vCard is to be displayed. This type is based on
   the semantics of the X.520 Common Name attribute.

   The type may specify the type parameters CHARSET, to specify a
   character set for the type value, and LANGUAGE, to specify a language
   for the type value. These are further defined in [MIME-DIR].

   Type special note: The type value is a structured string
   corresponding, in sequence, to the Family Name, Given Name,
   Additional Names, Honorific Prefixes, and Suffixes corresponding to
   the individual or resource associated with the vCard. The component
   strings are delimited by SEMI-COLON character (ASCII decimal 59) and
   possibly one or more LWSP. This type is based on the semantics of the
   X.520 individual name attributes.

   The type may specify the type parameters CHARSET, to specify a
   character set for the type value, and LANGUAGE, to specify a language
   for the type value. These are further defined in [MIME-DIR].

1.5 Delivery Addressing Profile Types

   These profile types are concerned with information associated with
   the delivery addressing or label for the vCard object.

1.5.1 ADR Type Definition

   To: ietf-mime-direct@umich.edu

   Subject: Registration of application/directory MIME type ADR

   Type name: ADR

   Type purpose: To specify the structured delivery address strings of
   the individual or resource associated with the vCard.

   Type encoding: text

   Type special notes: The type value is a string consisting of a
   sequence of address components (i.e., extended address, street
   address, locality, region, postal code, and country name) separated
   by SEMI-COLON character (ASCII decimal 59) and optionally one or more
   LWSP.

   The usual line-folding technique described in [MIME-DIR] can be used
   to represent type values consisting of long lines of text. However, a
   line break character in a value MUST be encoded using either Base64
   or Quoted-Printable methods.

   The type may include the type parameter _TYPE_ to further qualify the
   usage of the delivery address. The TYPE parameter values may include:
   _DOM_ to indicate a domestic delivery address, _INTL_ to indicate an
   international delivery address, _POSTAL_ to indicate a postal
   delivery address, _PARCEL_ to indicate a parcel delivery address,
   _HOME_ to indicate a delivery address for a residence, _WORK_ to
   indicate delivery address for a place of work, and _PREF_ for the
   preferred delivery address when more than one address might be
   specified. These type parameter values may be specified as a
   parameter list (i.e., _TYPE=DOM;TYPE=POSTAL_) or as a value list
   (i.e., _TYPE=DOM;POSTAL_). This type is based on semantics of the
   X.520 geographical and postal addressing attributes. The default is
   _TYPE=INTL;POSTAL;PARCEL;WORK_. The default can be overridden to some
   other set of values by specifying one or more alternate values. For
   example, the default can be reset to _TYPE=DOM;POSTAL;WORK;HOME_ to
   specify a domestic delivery address for postal delivery to a
   residence that is also used for work.

   The type may also specify the type parameters CHARSET, to specify a
   character set for the type value, and LANGUAGE, to specify a language
   for the type value. These are further defined in [MIME-DIR].

   Type name: LABEL

   Type purpose: To specify the formatted delivery address string of the
   individual or resource associated with the vCard.

   Type encoding: text

   Type special notes: The type value is a string consisting of a
   sequence of lines of formatted text corresponding to the delivery
   address.

   The usual line-folding technique described in [MIME-DIR] can be used
   to represent type values consisting of long lines of text. However, a
   formatted line break character in a value MUST be encoded using
   either Base64 or Quoted-Printable methods.

   The type may include the type parameter _TYPE_ to further qualify the
   usage of the delivery label. The TYPE parameter values may include:
   _DOM_ to indicate a domestic delivery label, _INTL_ to indicate an
   international delivery label, _POSTAL_ to indicate a postal delivery
   label, _PARCEL_ to indicate a parcel delivery label, _HOME_ to
   indicate a delivery label for a residence, _WORK_ to indicate
   delivery label for a place of work, and _PREF_ for the preferred
   delivery label when more than one label might be specified. These
   type parameter values may specified as a parameter list (i.e.,
   _TYPE=DOM;TYPE=POSTAL_) or as a value list (i.e., _TYPE=DOM;POSTAL_).
   This type is based on semantics of the X.520 geographical and postal
   addressing attributes. The default is _TYPE=INTL;POSTAL;PARCEL;WORK_.
   The default can be overridden to some other set of values by
   specifying one or more alternate values. For example, the default can
   be reset to _TYPE=INTL;POST;PARCEL;HOME_ to specify an international
   delivery label for both postal and parcel delivery to a residencial
   location.

   Type encoding: text.

   Type special notes: This type is based on the X.520 Business Category
   explanatory attribute. This property is included as an organizational
   type to avoid confusion with the semantics of the TITLE type and
   incorrect usage of that type when the semantics of this type is
   intended.

   The type may specify the type parameters CHARSET, to specify a
   character set for the type value, and LANGUAGE, to specify a language
   for the type value. These are further defined in [MIME-DIR].

1.8.3 LOGO Type Definition

   To: ietf-mime-direct@umich.edu

   Subject: Registration of application/directory MIME type LOGO

   Type name: LOGO

   Type purpose: To specify a graphic image of the logo of the
   organization that is associated with the individual or resource the
   vCard belongs to.

   Type encoding: text.

   Type special notes: The type may include the type parameter _TYPE_ to
   specify the format of the graphic image. The TYPE parameter values
   may include _GIF_ to indicate the GIF format and _JPEG_ to indicate
   the JPEG format. The type may also include the type parameter
   _ENCODING_ to specify the content encoding applied to the graphic
   image. The ENCODING parameter value may include _BASE64_ to indicate
   the Base64 encoding or _QUOTED-PRINTABLE_ to indicate the quoted-
   printable encoding. The type may also include the type parameter
   _VALUE_ to specify the location of the type value. The VALUE
   parameter values may include _INLINE_ to indicate that the graphic
   image value is included within the content type value, _URL_ to
   indicate the uniform resource locator for where the content for the
   graphic image can be found in the network, and _CID_ to indicate the
   content-id for the MIME entity that encapsulates the content for the
   graphic image.

   Type example:

        LOGO;VALUE=URL:http://www.abc.com/pub/logos/abccorp.jpg

1.8.4 AGENT Type Definition

   Subject: Registration of application/directory MIME type AGENT

   Type name: AGENT

   Type purpose: To specify information about another person who will
   act on behalf of the individual or resource associate with the vCard
   object.

   Type encoding: text.

   Type special notes: This type typically is used to specify an area
   administrator, assistant, or secretary for the individual associated
   with the vCard object. A key characteristic of the Agent type is that
   it represents somebody or something that is separately addressable.
   The value for this type is the content message identifier or Uniform

                vCard Application/Directory Content Type


   Resource Locator associated with the vCard defining the Agent
   individual or resource.

   The type may include the type parameter _VALUE_ to specify the
   location of the type value. The VALUE parameter values may include
   _CID_ to indicate the value specifies the content identifier for the
   MIME entity containing the value or _URL_ to indicate the value
   specifies the uniform resource locator for the value. The type
   parameter may also include _INLINE_; however, this is not a
   recommended practice as MIME user agents will not be expected to be
   able to process vCard objects nested in this manner. Nested vCard
   object will be expected to be mailed within a single message as
   multiple MIME entities. The INLINE nesting of vCard object may have
   some limited utility in where a monolithic data stream is required.

   Type example:

          AGENT;VALUE=CID:
           <JQPUBLIC.part3.960129T083020.xyzMail@host3.com>

1.8.5 ORG Type Definition

   To: ietf-mime-direct@umich.edu

   Subject: Registration of application/directory MIME type ORG

   Type name: ORG

   Type purpose: To specify the organizational name and units associated
   with the vCard object.

   Type encoding: text.

   Type special notes: The type is based on the X.520 Organization Name
   and Organization Unit attributes. The type value is a structured
   string consisting of the organization name, followed by any
   organizational units. The string components are separated the SEMI-
   COLON character (ASCII decimal 59).

   The type may specify the type parameters CHARSET, to specify a
   character set for the type value, and LANGUAGE, to specify a language
   for the type value. These are further defined in [MIME-DIR].

   Type example:

                ORG:ABC, Inc.;North American Division;Marketing

1.9 Explanatory Profile Types

   These profile types are concerned with additional explanations, such
   as that related to informational notes or revisions specific to the
   vCard object.

                vCard Application/Directory Content Type


   Type name: UID

   Type purpose: To specify a value that represents a globally unique
   identifier corresponding to the individual or resource associated
   with the vCard object.

   Type encoding: text.

   Type special notes: The type value can be used as a mechanism to
   relate different vCard objects. Some examples of valid forms of
   unique identifiers would include ISO 9070 formal public identifiers
   (FPI) as defined in [ISO 9070], X.500 distinguished names, machine-
   generated random numbers with a statistically high likelihood of
   being globally unique, and Uniform Resource Locators (URL). If an URL
   is specified, it is suggested that the URL reference a service which
   will produce an updated version of the vCard associated with the
   individual or resource.

   The type may include the type parameter _TYPE_ to specify the format
   of the unique identifier. The TYPE parameter values may include
   _ISO9070_ to indicate the ISO 9070 FPI type of unique identifier,
   _X500_ to indicate the X.500 DSN type of unique identifier, _MACH_ to
   indicate a machine generated random number type of unique identifier,

   These profile types are concerned with the security of communication
   pathways or access to the vCard object.

1.10.1 KEY Type Definition

   To: ietf-mime-direct@umich.edu

   Subject: Registration of application/directory MIME type VERSION

   Type name: VERSION

   Type purpose: To specify an identifier corresponding to the highest
   version of the vCard profile used in creating the vCard object.

   Type encoding: text.

   Type special notes: The type value corresponding to this version of
   the vCard profile MUST be _2.1_.

1.11 Extended Profile Types

   The profile types defined by this document can be extended with
   private types using the private type mechanism defined in [MIME].
   Private types with a name starting with _X-_ may be defined
   bilaterally between two cooperating agents without outside
   registration or standardization.

2. Formal Grammar

   The following modified Backus-Naur Notation (BNF) is provided to
   assist developers in building parsers for the vCard.

   This syntax is written according to the form described in RFC 822,
   but it references just this small subset of RFC 822 literals:

     CR         =  <ASCII CR, carriage return>  ; (15, 13.)
     LF         =  <ASCII LF, linefeed>         ; (12,10.)
     CRLF               =  CR LF
     SPACE      =  <ASCII SP, space>            ; (40,32.)
     HTAB       =  <ASCII HT, horizontal-tab>        ; (11,9.)
