   Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based internets.
   In particular it defines objects for managing MAC bridges based on
   the IEEE 802.1D-1998 MAC Bridges and IEEE 802.1Q-1998 Virtual LAN

   (VLAN) standards for bridging between Local Area Network (LAN)
   segments.  Provisions are made for support of transparent bridging.
   Provisions are also made so that these objects apply to bridges
   connected by subnetworks other than LAN segments.  This memo also
   includes several MIB modules in a manner that is compliant to the
   SNMPv2 SMI [18].


   1.  The SNMP Network Management Framework

   The SNMP Network Management Framework consists of several major
   components.  They are:

   o    RFC 1902 [18] which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
        describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.
        This supercedes an earlier definition of SMI in RFC 1155 [3].

   o    STD 17, RFC 1213 [5] defines MIB-II, the core set of managed
        objects for the Internet suite of protocols.

   o    RFC 1157 [4] and RFC 1905 [17] which define two versions of
        protocols providing network access to managed objects.

   Textual conventions are defined in RFC 1903 [19] and conformance
   statements are defined in RFC 1904 [20].

   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.

   This memo specifies MIB modules that are compliant to the SNMPv2 SMI
   [18].


   1.1.  Object Definitions

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object object type is named
   by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The
   object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely
   identify a specific instantiation of the object.  For human
   convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to
   refer to the object type.

   2.  Overview

   A common device present in many networks is the Bridge.  This device
   is used to connect Local Area Network segments below the network
   layer.  These devices are often known as 'layer 2 switches'.

   There are two major modes defined for this bridging; transparent and
   source route.  The transparent method of bridging is defined by IEEE
   802.1D-1998 [11].  Managed objects for source route bridges are
   defined in [15].

   IEEE 802.1D is augmented by IEEE 802.1Q-1998 [12] to provide support
   for 'virtual bridged LANs' where a single bridged physical LAN
   network may be used to support multiple logical bridged LANs, each of
   which offers a service approximately the same as that defined by
   802.1D.  Such virtual LANs (VLANs) are an integral feature of
   switched LAN networks.  A VLAN can be viewed as a group of end-
   stations on multiple LAN segments and can communicate as if they were
   on a single LAN.  IEEE 802.1Q defines port-based Virtual LANs where
   membership is determined by the bridge port on which data frames are
   received.  This memo defines the objects needed for the management of
   port-based VLANs in bridge entities.

   This memo defines those objects needed for the management of a
   bridging entity operating in the transparent mode, as well as some
   objects applicable to all types of bridges.  Managed objects for
   Source-Routing are defined in [15].


   2.1.  Scope

   This MIB includes a comprehensive set of managed objects which
   attempts to match the set defined in IEEE 802.1D and IEEE 802.1Q.
   However, to be consistent with the spirit of the SNMP Framework, a
   subjective judgement was made to omit the objects from those
   standards most 'costly' to implement in an agent and least omissions
   are described in section 3 below.

   Historical note:

   RFC 1493 used the following principles for determining inclusion of
   an object in the BRIDGE-MIB module:

   (1)  Start with a small set of essential objects and add only as
        further objects are needed.





   Bell, et al.            Expires October 1998         [Page 3]

   Internet Draft          Bridge MIB Extensions              April 1998


   (2)  Require objects be essential for either fault or configuration
        management.

   (3)  Consider evidence of current use and/or utility.

   (4)  Limit the total of objects.

   (5)  Exclude objects which are simply derivable from others in this
        or other MIBs.

   (6)  Avoid causing critical sections to be heavily instrumented.  The
        guideline that was followed is one counter per critical section
        per layer.




   3.  Structure of MIBs

   This document defines additional objects, on top of those existing in
   the base BRIDGE-MIB module from defined in RFC1493: that MIB module
   is maintained unchanged for backwards compatibility.  Section 3.4.3
   of the present document contains some recommendations regarding usage
   of objects in RFC1493 by devices implementing the enhancements
   defined here.

   Two MIB modules are defined here:


   (1)  Managed objects for an extended bridge MIB module P-BRIDGE-MIB
        for the traffic class and multicast filtering enhancements
        defined by IEEE 802.1D-1998.


   (2)  Managed objects for a virtual bridge MIB modeul Q-BRIDGE-MIB for
        the Virtual LAN bridging enhancements defined by IEEE 802.1Q-
        1998.


   3.1.  Structure of Extended Bridge MIB module

   Objects in this MIB are arranged into groups.  Each group is
   organized as a set of related objects.  The overall structure and
   assignment of objects to their groups is shown below.

   3.1.1.  Relationship to IEEE 802.1D-1998 Manageable Objects

   This section contains a cross-reference to the objects defined in
   IEEE 802.1D-1998 [11]. It also details those objects that are not
   considered necessary in this MIB module.

   Some objects defined by [11] have been included in the virtual bridge
   MIB module rather than this one: dot1qTpGroupTable and
   dot1qServiceReqTable are required for virtual bridged LANs with
   additional indexing e.g. per-VLAN, per-FDB and so are not defined
   here. Instead, devices which do not implement virtual bridged LANs,
   should implement these tables with a fixed value for dot1qFdbId (the
   value 1 is recommended).  Devices which support dynamic learning of
   Multicast Group Addresses in the Filtering Database should support
   dot1qTpGroupTable.  Devices which support static or dynamic learning
   of Multicast Group Service Requirements should support
   dot1qServiceReqTable.

      The following IEEE 802.1D management objects have not been
      included in the Bridge MIB for the indicated reasons.

                                       (e.g. per-VLAN, per-Group).
                                       Only per-{device,port,application}
                                       control is provided in this MIB.


   3.1.2.  The dot1dExtBase Group

   This group contains the objects which are applicable to all bridges
   implementing the traffic class and multicast filtering features of
   802.1D.  It includes per-device configuration of GARP and GMRP
   protocols.  This group will be implemented by all devices which
   implement the extensions defined in 802.1D-1998.


   3.1.3.  The dot1dPriority Group

   This group contains the objects for configuring and reporting status
   of priority-based queuing mechanisms in a bridge.  This includes per-
   port user_priority treatment, mapping of user_priority in frames into
   internal traffic classes and outbound user_priority and
   access_priority.


   3.1.4.  The dot1dGarp Group

   This group contains the objects for configuring and reporting on
   operation of the Generic Attribute Registration Protocol (GARP).

   3.1.5.  The dot1dGmrp Group

   This group contains the objects for configuring and reporting on
   operation of the GARP Multicast Registration Protocol (GMRP).


   3.1.6.  The dot1dHCPort Group

   This group contains the objects for reporting port bridging
   statistics for high-capacity network interfaces.




   3.2.  Structure of Virtual Bridge MIB module

   Objects in this MIB are arranged into groups.  Each group is
   organized as a set of related objects.  The overall structure and
   assignment of objects to their groups is shown below.  Some of the
   original objects from RFC1493 need to be indexed differently when
   extended in a VLAN environment so some objects in that module
   effectively duplicate new objects defined here: this is necessary for
   backwards compatibility.


   3.2.1.  Relationship to IEEE 802.1Q Manageable Objects

   This section contains a cross-reference to the objects defined in
   [12]. It also details those objects that are not considered necessary
   in this MIB module.

   Note: unlike IEEE 802.1D, [12] chose not to define a new set of
   managed object names so those following are referenced from the
   descriptions of management operations with section numbering from
   clause 12 in that document.

   3.2.2.  The dot1qBase Group

   This mandatory group contains the objects which are applicable to all
   bridges implementing 802.1Q virtual LANs.


   3.2.3.  The dot1qTp Group

   This group contains objects that control the operation and report the
   status of transparent bridging.  This includes management of the
   dynamic Filtering Databases for both unicast and multicast
   forwarding.  This group will be implemented by all bridges that
   perform destination-address filtering.


   3.2.4.  The dot1qStatic Group

   This group contains objects that control static configuration
   information for transparent bridging.  This includes management of
   the static entries in the Filtering Databases for both unicast and
   multicast forwarding.


   3.2.5.  The dot1qVlan Group

   This group contains objects that control configuration and report
   status of the Virtual LANs known to a bridge.  This includes
   management of the statically configured VLANs as well as reporting
   VLANs discovered by other means e.g. GVRP.  It also controls
   configuration and reports status of per-port objects relating to
   VLANs and reports traffic statistics.  It also provides for
   management of the VLAN Learning Constraints.




   3.3.  Textual Conventions

   The datatypes MacAddress, BridgeId, Timeout, EnabledStatus, PortList,
   VlanIfIndex and VlanId are used as textual conventions in this
   document.  These textual conventions have NO effect on either the
   syntax nor the semantics of any managed object.  Objects defined
   using these conventions are always encoded by means of the rules that
   define their primitive type.  Hence, no changes to the SMI or the
   SNMP are necessary to accommodate these textual conventions which are

   adopted merely for the convenience of readers.




   3.4.  Relationship to Other MIBs

   As described above, some IEEE 802.1D management objects have not been
   included in this MIB because they overlap with objects in other MIBs
   applicable to a bridge implementing this MIB.  In particular, it is
   assumed that a bridge implementing this MIB will also implement (at
   least) the 'system' group defined in MIB-II [6], the 'interfaces'
   group defined [14] and the old Bridge MIB [13].


   3.4.1.  Relationship to the 'system' group

   In MIB-II, the 'system' group is defined as being mandatory for all
   systems such that each managed entity contains one instance of each
   object in the 'system' group.  Thus, those objects apply to the
   entity as a whole irrespective of whether the entity's sole
   functionality is bridging, or whether bridging is only a subset of
   the entity's functionality.


   3.4.2.  Relation to Interfaces MIB

   RFC 1573, the Interface MIB Evolution [14], requires that any MIB
   which is an adjunct of the Interface MIB, clarify specific areas
   within the Interface MIB.  These areas were intentionally left vague
   in [14] to avoid over constraining the MIB, thereby precluding
   management of certain media-types.

   Section 3.3 of [14] enumerates several areas which a media- specific
   MIB must clarify.  Each of these areas is addressed in a following
   subsection.  The implementor is referred to [14] in order to
   understand the general intent of these areas.

   In [14], the 'interfaces' group is defined as being mandatory for all
   systems and contains information on an entity's interfaces, where
   each interface is thought of as being attached to a `subnetwork'.
   (Note that this term is not to be confused with `subnet' which refers
   to an addressing partitioning scheme used in the Internet suite of
   protocols.) The term 'segment' is used in this memo to refer to such
   a subnetwork, whether it be an Ethernet segment, a 'ring', a WAN





   Bell, et al.            Expires October 1998        [Page 12]

   Internet Draft          Bridge MIB Extensions              April 1998


   link, or even an X.25 virtual circuit.

   Implicit in this Bridge MIB is the notion of ports on a bridge.  Each
   of these ports is associated with one interface of the 'interfaces'
   group (one row in ifTable) and, in most situations, each port is
   associated with a different interface.  However, there are situations
   in which multiple ports are associated with the same interface.  An
   example of such a situation would be several ports each corresponding
   one-to-one with several X.25 virtual circuits but all on the same
   interface.

   Each port is uniquely identified by a port number.  A port number has
   no mandatory relationship to an interface number, but in the simple
   case a port number will have the same value as the corresponding
   interface's interface number.  Port numbers are in the range
   (1..dot1dBaseNumPorts).

   Some entities perform other functionality as well as bridging through
   the sending and receiving of data on their interfaces.  In such
   situations, only a subset of the data sent/received on an interface
   is within the domain of the entity's bridging functionality.  This
   subset is considered to be delineated according to a set of
   protocols, with some protocols being bridged, and other protocols not
   being bridged.  For example, in an entity which exclusively performed
   bridging, all protocols would be considered as being bridged, whereas
   in an entity which performed IP routing on IP datagrams and only
   bridged other protocols, only the non-IP data would be considered as
   being bridged.  Thus, this Bridge MIB (and in particular, its
   counters) is applicable only to that subset of the data on an
   entity's interfaces which is sent/received for a protocol being
   bridged.  All such data is sent/received via the ports of the bridge.

   3.4.2.1.  Layering Model

   This memo assumes the interpretation of the Interfaces Group to be in
   accordance with [14] which states that the interfaces table (ifTable)
   contains information on the managed resource's interfaces and that
   each sub-layer below the internetwork layer of a network interface is
   considered an interface.

   This memo recommends that, within an entity, each VLAN which is
   instantiated as an entry in dot1qVlanTable by either management
   configuration through dot1qVlanStaticTable or by dynamic means (e.g.
   through GVRP protocol), also be represented by an entry in ifTable.

   3.4.2.2.  Interpretations of ifTable for VLANs

   Some specific interpretations of ifTable for VLAN entries follow.

      ifTable Object              Use for VLAN Layer
      ==============              ==================

      ifIndex                     Each VLAN is represented by an entry
                                  in the ifTable.

      ifDescr                     Description of the VLAN e.g. VLAN
                                  name. It is recommended that this
                                  bear some resemblance to
                                  dot1qVlanStaticName.

      ifType                      propVirtual(53)

      ifMtu                       0 or smallest MTU of all of the
                                  ports in the VLAN.

      ifSpeed                     0
      ifPhysAddress               zero-filled

      ifAdminStatus               up(1) whenever there are active ports
      ifOperStatus                in the VLAN which are ready to send
                                  and/or receive traffic.  See [14] for
                                  other defined usage which applies.

      ifLastChange                see interfaces MIB [14].

      ifName                      Textual name (unique on this system)
                                  of the VLAN or an octet string of zero
                                  length.

                                  entries.


   3.4.2.3.  ifStackTable

   In addition, [14] defines a table 'ifStackTable' for describing the
   relationship between logical interfaces within an entity.  It is
   anticipated that implementors will use this table to describe the
   binding of e.g. IP interfaces to VLANs and then onto physical ports.
   However, it cannot represent the full capability of the 802.1Q VLAN
   bridging standard since that makes a distinction between VLAN
   bindings on 'ingress' to and 'egress' from a port: these
   relationships may or may not be symmetrical whereas [14] assumes a
   symmetrical binding for transmit and receive.  This makes it
   necessary to define other manageable objects for configuring which
   ports are members of which VLANs.


   3.4.2.4.  ifRcvAddressTable

   This table contains all MAC addresses, unicast, multicast, and
   broadcast, for which an interface will receive packets and forward
   them up to a higher layer entity for local consumption.  The format
   of the address, contained in ifRcvAddressAddress, is the same as for
   ifPhysAddress.

   This table does not include unicast or multicast addresses which are
   accepted for possible forwarding out some other port.  This table is
   explicitly not intended to provide a bridge address filtering
   mechanism.


   3.4.3.  Relation to Basic Bridge MIB

   This section defines how objects in the basic bridge MIB module
   should be represented for devices which implement the extensions:
   some of the old objects are less useful in such devices but must
   still be implemented for reasons of backwards comaptibility. Note
   that formal conformance statements for that MIB module do not exist
   since it is defined in SMIv1.

   3.4.3.1.  The dot1dBase Group

   This mandatory group contains the objects which are applicable to all
   types of bridges.  Interpretation of this group is unchanged.


   3.4.3.2.  The dot1dStp Group

   This group contains the objects that denote the bridge's state with
   respect to the Spanning Tree Protocol.  Interpretation of this group
   is unchanged.


   3.4.3.3.  The dot1dTp Group

   This group contains objects that describe the entity's state with
   respect to transparent bridging.

   In a device operating with a single Filtering Database,
   interpretation of this group is unchanged.

   In a device supporting multiple Filtering Databases, this group is
   interpreted as follows:

   dot1dTpLearnedEntryDiscards
         The sum of the counters for each of the individual Filtering
         Databases.

      dot1dTpAgingTime
         This applies to all Filtering Databases.

      dot1dTpFdbTable
         Report MAC addresses learned on each port, regardless of which
         Filtering Database they have been learnt in.  If an address has
         been learnt in multiple databases on a single port, report it
         only once.  If an address has been learnt in multiple databases
         on more than one port, report the entry on any one of the valid
         ports.

      dot1dTpPortTable
         This table is port-based and is not affected by multiple
         Filtering Databases or multiple VLANs.  The counters should
         include frames received or transmitted for all VLANs. Note that
         equivalent 64-bit port statistics counters are defined in this
         document for high-capacity network interfaces.

   3.4.3.4.  The dot1dStatic Group

   This optional group contains objects that describe the configuration
   of destination-address filtering.

   In a device operating with a single Filtering Database,
   interpretation of this group is unchanged.

   In a device supporting multiple Filtering Databases, this group is
   interpreted as follows:

   dot1dStaticTable
         Entries read from this table include all static entries from
         all of the Filtering Databases.  Entries for the same MAC
         address and receive port in more than one Filtering Database
         must appear only once since these are the indices of this
         table.  This table should be implemented as read-only in
         devices that support multiple Forwarding Databases - instead,
         write access should be provided through dot1qStaticTable, as
         defined in this document.





   4.  Extensions to RFC 1493

   In addition to the objects in RFC1493, this document contains:

   (1)  References point to sections of IEEE 802.1D-1998.

   (2)  Added support for multiple traffic classes and dynamic multicast
        filtering as per IEEE 802.1D-1998.

   (3)  Added support for bridged Virtual LANs as per IEEE 802.1Q-1998.

   (4)  Added support for 64-bit versions of existing RFC1493 port
        counters.

   5.  Change Log and Editorial Stuff

   5.1.  Changes since draft-bell-bridgemib-00.txt


   [To Do (2)]
        SMIv2 conversion has been done.

   [To Do (3)]
        Conformance Groups and clauses have been defined.

   [To Do (4)]
        Done.  See also Issue (1).

   [To Do (5)]
        Section 3.4.3 updated with recommendations on interpretation of
        the BRIDGE-MIB from RFC 1493.

   [Issue (1)]
        Counter32 versions of the statistics have been provided, with
        appropriate conformance clauses.

   [Issue (4)]
        RFC 1493 should be included by reference, as we are not
        modifying it in any way, and it should be progressed to a full
        standard.

   [Issue (6)]
        dot1qServiceReqTable has been added to support static and
        dynamic configuration of the "Forward All Groups" and "Forward
        Unregistered Groups" Service Requirements.  This has been added
        to the dot1q MIB, rather than the dot1p MIB, as it is applied to
        each Filtering Database separately.

   [Issue (7)]
        The allocation of Filtering Database ID must be done
        automatically for GVRP, and is potentially a source of conflict
        with dot1qLearningConstraintsTable, if the user is allowed to
        allocate it manually.  The user only needs to know the FDB ID to
        determine the VLAN(s) referred to by the Filtering Databases, in
        dot1qTpFdbTable, etc.  For these reasons, dot1qVlanStaticFdb has
        been removed from dot1qVlanStaticTable, and the user cannot
        manually allocate an FDB ID.  The automatically allocated value
        is still reported by dot1qVlanFdbId, in dot1qVlanTable.  The
        next free FDB ID value, dot1qNextFreeFdbId, is therefore not

        required and has been removed.

   [Issue (10)]
        No action required.

   [Issue (13)]
        No action required.  This version is simpler than 802.1Q.

   [Issue (14)]
        No action required.

   [Issue (15)]
        Removed the per FDB Aging Time, dot1qFdbAgingTime.

   [Issue (16)]
        No action required.  Per-port is sufficient.

   [Issue (17)]
        Put dot1qVlanTable before dot1qVlanStaticTable, and moved the
        definition of dot1qVlanIfIndex to dot1qVlanTable.  As
        dot1qVlanTable has equivalents to all of the dot1qVlanStatic
        entries, there should not be any issue with the indexing of
        either of these tables.

   [Issue (18)]
        No action required.  Do not think (up|down) are appropriate, as
        the controls using (enabled|disabled) are not for interfaces.
        There are many examples of (enabled|disabled) used as control
        status values (including RFC1493), but don't know of a textual
        convention for this.

   [Issue (19)]
        All write-only items have been changed to read-write, with a
        definition of the value to be returned when they are read.

   [Issue (23)]
        Added dot1qConstraintSetDefault and dot1qConstraintTypeDefault,
        allowing a default constraint set to be defined for unspecified
        VLANs.  This allows a shared VLAN set, or independent VLAN set
        constraints to be used as defaults.

   [Issue (24)]
        Separate controls to enable and disable GARP have been removed.
        They were an unnecessary complication.  GMRP and GVRP controls
        have been simplified as a result of this.

   Other changes
        The items in dot1qPortVlanTable have been re-ordered, to put all
        GVRP items together.

        Additional notes have been provided in section 3.1.1, explaining
        why Multicast Group and Service Requirements are defined only in
        the Q-BRIDGE-MIB.

        New issues added, closed issues moved to a new section; minor
        editorial changes.

        AllUnregisteredGroups) in dot1qServiceReqTable or should we
        leave with dot1qServiceRequirement as a 2nd index?  (assume the
        former for now).

   (27) Do we want "capabilities" bitmap objects?

   (28) Should ifRcvAddressTable contain entries for e.g. spanning-tree,
        GMRP, GVRP addresses?



   5.4.  Closed Issues in his Draft


   (1)  Should this MIB offer support for SMIv1-only agents
        (Counter32/64)? ADDED Counter32/Counter64 versions of the per-
        VLAN statistics. ADDED Counter64 versions of the per-port
        statistics from RFC1493. Added appropriate conformance clauses
        for all.

   (4)  Include RFC1493 by value or reference? REFERENCE

   (6)  Representations of filtering entry for "AllGroups" and
        "AllUnregisteredGroups" DONE

   (7)  Should we represent all available FIDs up front or use a "next
        free" object for the manager to create them as needed?  NEITHER

        - see issue 25 above.

   (10) Separate config and status info for e.g. dot1dPortGmrpTable,
        dot1qPortVlanTable?  NO CHANGE

   (13) Learning constraints table seems clumsy - can we improve this?
        DONE

   (14) Do we need to define a "notify vlan registration failure" trap?
        NO

   (15) dot1qFdbAgingTime is currently per-FID: 802.1Q has it per-
        device. PER DEVICE

   (16) dot1pPortDefaultUserPriority - can this usefully be per-port,
        per-VLAN? PER-PORT

   (17) Both dot1qVlanTable and dot1qVlanStaticTable are indexed by
        dot1qVlanIfIndex but that only appears in dot1qVlanStaticTable -
        is this a problem? MOVED TO dot1qVlanTable.

   (18) Should we choose same names (up/down) as IF-MIB for values of
        the admin/oper status values, rather than defining our own new
        TC?  Is there an existing TC we can import? NO CHANGE.

   (19) Should we have write-only "reset" objects or should these be
        read-write to help MIB browsers (assume write-only)? READ-WRITE.

   8.  Acknowledgments

   This document expands upon previous work which resulted in RFC1493.

   Much of the groundwork for this document was performed by the IEEE
   802.1 working group during the definition of the IEEE 802.1D updates
   [12] and IEEE 802.1Q [13].  Some ideas were also taken from an
   earlier Internet Draft for a VLAN MIB [16] from I. Jeyasubramanian.

   The authors wish to thank the members of the Bridge Working Group for
   their many comments and suggestions which improved this effort.

   10.  Security Considerations

   Certain management information defined in this MIB may be considered
   sensitive in some network environments.  Therefore, authentication of
   received SNMP requests and controlled access to management
   information should be employed in such environments.  The method for
   this authentication is a function of the SNMP Administrative
   Framework, and has not been expanded by this MIB.

   Several objects in this MIB allow write access.  Setting these
   objects can have a serious effect on the operation of the network,
   including enabling or disabling forwarding of data.  It is
   recommended that implementers seriously consider whether set
   operations should be allowed without providing, at a minimum,
   authentication of request origin.
