1.  Introduction

   This document clarifies an ambiguity related to the definition of
   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) packet discussed in
   [RFC8300].

   The processing of the O bit in the Network Service Header (NSH) must
   follow the updated behavior specified in Section 3.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document makes use of the terms defined in [RFC7665] and
   [RFC8300].

   The document defines the following terms:

   SFC data plane element:  refers to SFC-aware SF, SFF, SFC Proxy, or
      Classifier as defined in the SFC data plane architecture [RFC7665]
      and further refined in [RFC8300].

   OAM control element:  an NSH-aware elements that is capable of
      generating NSH OAM packets.  An SFC data plane element may behave
      as an OAM control element.

   OAM data:  refers to an OAM command (e.g., Connectivity Verification
      and Continuity Checks [RFC7276]), any data that influences how to
      execute a companion OAM command (e.g., identity of a terminating
      Service Function (SF)), the output data of an OAM command, and any
      combination thereof.

   User data:  refers to user packets cited in Section 5.7 of [RFC7665].

3.  An Update to RFC8300

   This document updates Section 2.2 of [RFC8300] as follows:

OLD:

   O bit:  Setting this bit indicates an OAM packet (see [RFC6291]).
      The actual format and processing of SFC OAM packets is outside the
      scope of this specification (for example, see [SFC-OAM-FRAMEWORK]
      for one approach).

      The O bit MUST be set for OAM packets and MUST NOT be set for
      non-OAM packets.  The O bit MUST NOT be modified along the SFP.

      SF/SFF/SFC Proxy/Classifier implementations that do not support
      SFC OAM procedures SHOULD discard packets with O bit set, but MAY
      support a configurable parameter to enable forwarding received SFC
      OAM packets unmodified to the next element in the chain.
      Forwarding OAM packets unmodified by SFC elements that do not
      support SFC OAM procedures may be acceptable for a subset of OAM
      functions, but it can result in unexpected outcomes for others;
      thus, it is recommended to analyze the impact of forwarding an OAM
      packet for all OAM functions prior to enabling this behavior.  The
      configurable parameter MUST be disabled by default.

NEW:

   O bit:  Setting this bit indicates an SFC OAM packet.  Such a packet
      is any NSH-encapasulated packet that exclusively includes OAM
      data.  An OAM data can be included in the Fixed-Length Context
      Header, optional Context Headers, and/or the inner packet.

      The O bit is typically set by an OAM controller or an ultimate
      target of an SFC OAM packet that triggers a response (e.g., a
      sepcific SFC-aware SF, the last SFF of an SFP).

      The O bit MUST be set for SFC OAM packets and MUST NOT be set for
      non-OAM packets.  The O bit MUST NOT be modified along the SFP.

      NSH-encapsulated packets that include user data are not considered
      as SFC OAM packets even if some OAM data (e.g., record route) is
      also supplied in the packet.

      When an OAM data is included in the inner packet, the Next
      Protocol field is set to reflect the structure of that inner OAM
      packet.  The setting and processing of the O bit neither assumes

      nor expects detailed analysis of the content of any inner IP
      packet carried by the NSH.  As such, SFFs, SFC-aware SFs, and SFC
      Proxies SHOULD discard any NSH packets with the O bit set and Next
      Protocol set to something that is not itself an OAM protocol.
      This includes discarding the packet when the O bit is set and the
      Next Protocol is set to 0x01 (IPv4), 0x02 (IPv6), 0x03 (MPLS), or
      0x05 (Ethernet).

      An SFC OAM packet MAY include optional Context Headers (e.g., a
      subscriber identifier [RFC8979] or a flow identifier
      [I-D.ietf-sfc-nsh-tlv]) that are used to influence the processing
      of the packet by SFC data plane elements.

      An SFC OAM packet MAY include OAM data in both Context Headers and
      the inner packet.  The processing (including the order) of the OAM
      data SHOULD be specified in the relevant OAM or Context Header
      specification.

      SFC-aware SF/SFF/SFC Proxy/Classifier implementations that do not
      support SFC OAM procedures SHOULD discard packets with O bit set,
      but MAY support a configurable parameter to enable forwarding
      received SFC OAM packets unmodified to the next element in the
      chain.  Forwarding SFC OAM packets unmodified by SFC elements that
      do not support SFC OAM procedures may be acceptable for a subset
      of OAM functions, but it can result in unexpected outcomes for
      others; thus, it is recommended to analyze the impact of
      forwarding an SFC OAM packet for all OAM functions prior to
      enabling this behavior.  The configurable parameter MUST be
      disabled by default.

      The actual format and additional processing of SFC OAM packets is
      outside the scope of this specification.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not make any request to IANA.

5.  Security Considerations

   Data plane SFC-related security considerations, including privacy,
   are discussed in Section 6 of [RFC7665] and Section 8 of [RFC8300].

   Data icnluded in an SFC OAM packet SHOULD be integrity-protected
   [RFC9145].
