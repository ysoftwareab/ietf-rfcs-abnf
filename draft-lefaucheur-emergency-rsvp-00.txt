Abstract 
    
   An Emergency Telecommunications Service (ETS) requires the ability to 
   provide an elevated probability of call completion to an authorized 
   user in times of crisis. When supported over the Internet Protocol 
   suite, this may be achieved through an admission control solution 
   which supports call preemption capabilities as well as admission 
   priority capabilities, whereby some resources (e.g. bandwidth) are 
   reserved for emergency services only.

Specification of Requirements 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 
    
    
1.  Introduction 
    
   [EMERG-RQTS] and [EMERG-TEL] detail requirements for an Emergency 
   Telecommunications Service (ETS). The key requirement is to guarantee 
   superior probability of call completion from an authorized user in 
   times of crisis. To that end, some of these types of services require 
   that the network be capable of preempting calls; others do not 
   involve preemption but instead rely on another network mechanism 
   which we refer throughout this document as "admission priority" 
   whereby some resources (e.g. bandwidth) is set aside for the 
   emergency services only, in order to obtain a high probability of 
   call completion for those. 
    
   [EMERG-IMP] describes the call and admission control procedures (at 
   initial call set up, as well as after call establishment through 
   maintenance of a continuing call model of the status of all calls) 
   which allow support of an Emergency Telecommunications Service. 
   [EMERG-IMP] also describes how these call and admission control 
   procedures can be realized using the Resource reSerVation Protocol 
   [RSVP] along with its associated protocol suite and extensions, 
   including those for policy based admission control ([FW-POLICY], 
   [RSVP-POLICY]), for user authentication and authorization ([RSVP-ID]) 
   and for integrity and authentication of RSVP messages ([RSVP-CRYPTO-
   1], [RSVP-CRYPTO-2]). 
    
   Furthermore, [EMERG-IMP] describes how the RSVP Signaled Preemption 
   Priority Policy Element specified in [RSVP-PREEMP] can be used to 
   enforce the call preemption needed by some services of the ETS. 
    
   This document specifies RSVP extensions which can be used to enforce 
   the "admission priority" required by other services of the ETS.

      This is the initial version of the document 
    
    
2.  Overview of RSVP extensions and Operations 
    
   Let us consider the case where a call requiring Internet Emergency 
   Preference Service is to be established, and more specifically that 
   the preference to be granted to this call is in terms of admission 
   priority (i.e. by allowing that call to seize resources that have 
   been set-aside and not made available to normal calls) and that the 
   preference to be granted to this new call does not involve preempting 
   existing calls.  
    
   As described in [EMERG-IMP], the session establishment can be 
   conditioned to resource-based and policy-based admission control 
   achieved via RSVP signaling. In the case where the session control 
   protocol is SIP, the use of RSVP-based admission control by SIP is 
   specified in [SIP-RESOURCE]. 
    
   Devices involved in the session establishment are expected to be 
   aware of the priority requirements of emergency calls. Again, in the 
   case where the session control protocol is SIP, the SIP user agents 
   can be aware of the resource priority requirements in the case of an 
   emergency call using mechanisms specified in [SIP-PRIORITY]. 
    
   Where, as per our considered case, the priority requirement of the 
   emergency call involves admission priority, the devices involved in 
   the session establishment simply need to map the priority 
   requirements of the emergency call into an RSVP "admission priority" 
   level and convey this information in the relevant RSVP messages used 
   for admission control. The admission priority is encoded inside the 
   new Admission Priority Policy Element defined in this document. This 
   way, the RSVP-based admission control can take this information into 
   account at every RSVP-enabled network hop. 
    
   Note that this operates in a very similar manner to the case where 
   the priority requirement of the emergency call involves preemption 
   priority. In that case, the devices involved in the session 
   establishment map the emergency call requirement into an RSVP 
   "preemption priority" level (or more accurately into both a setup 
   preemption level and a defending preemption priority level) and 
   convey this information in the relevant RSVP messages used for 
   admission control. This preemption priority information is encoded 
   inside the Preemption Priority Policy Element of [RSVP-PREEMP] and 
   thus, can be taken into account at every RSVP-enabled network hop. 
    
2.1.  Operations of Admission Priority

                  Admission Priority Policy Element      October 2005 
 
 
   The RSVP admission priority defined in this document allows admission 
   bandwidth to be allocated for use by an authorized priority service. 
   Multiple models of bandwidth allocation MAY be used to that end. 
   However, the bandwidth allocation model MUST ensure that it is 
   possible to limit admission of non-priority traffic [Respectively, 
   lower priority traffic] to a maximum bandwidth which can be 
   configured below the link capacity (or below the bandwidth granted by 
   the scheduler to the relevant Diffserv PHB) thereby ensuring that 
   some capacity is effectively set aside for admission of priority 
   traffic [Respectively, higher priority traffic]. 
    
   A number of bandwidth allocation models have been defined in the IETF 
   for allocation of bandwidth across different classes of traffic 
   trunks in the context of Diffserv-aware MPLS Traffic Engineering. 
   Those include the Maximum Allocation Model (MAM) defined in [DSTE-
   MAM] and the Russian Dolls Model (RDM) specified in [DSTE-RDM]. These 
   same models MAY however be applied for allocation of bandwidth across 
   different levels of admission priority as defined in this document. 
   This section illustrates how MAM and RDM can indeed be used for 
   support of admission priority. For simplicity, operations with only a 
   single "priority" level (beyond non-priority) is illustrated here; 
   However, the reader will appreciate that operations with multiple 
   priority levels can easily be supported with these models.

      o represents a priority session 
    
    
2.1.1. 
      Illustration of Admission Priority with Maximum Allocation Model 
    
   This section illustrates operations of admission priority when a 
   Maximum Allocation Model is used for bandwidth allocation across non-
   priority traffic and priority traffic. A property of the Maximum 
   Allocation Model is that priority traffic can not use more than the 
   bandwidth reserved for priority traffic (even if the non-priority 
   traffic is not using all of the bandwidth available for it).

           Chart 1. Overall Link Capacity 
    
   Chart 1 shows a link within a routed network conforming to this 
   document.  On this link are two amounts of bandwidth available to two 
   types of traffic: non-priority and priority.  The aggregate of the 
   two amounts equals the total link capacity (or the total capacity 
   granted to the corresponding Diffserv Per Hop Behavior).   
   If the non-priority traffic load reaches the maximum bandwidth 
   available for non-priority, no additional non-priority sessions can 
   be accepted even if the bandwidth reserved for priority traffic is 
   not currently utilized.   
    
   With the Maximum Allocation Model, in the case where the priority 
   load reaches the maximum bandwidth reserved for priority calls, no 
   additional priority sessions can be accepted. 
    
   Chart 2 shows some of the non-priority capacity of this link being 
   used.

   Although this is not expected to occur in practice because of proper 
   allocation of bandwidth to priority traffic, for completeness Chart 5 
   shows the case where there priority traffic equates or exceeds the 
   bandwidth reserved for such priority traffic. 
   In that case additional priority sessions could not be accepted. They 
   may be handled by mechanisms which are beyond the scope of this 
   particular document (such as established through preemption of

           Chart 8. Partial non-priority load & Heavy Aggregate load 
    
    
   Chart 9 shows the case where all of the bandwidth available to non-
   priority traffic is being used and all of the remaining available 
   bandwidth is used by priority traffic. In that situation new non-
   priority sessions would be rejected. In that situation new priority 
   sessions could not be accepted right away. Those priority sessions 
   may be handled by mechanisms which are beyond the scope of this 
   particular document (such as established through preemption of 
   existing non-priority sessions, or new priority session requests 
   could be queues until capacity becomes available again for priority 
   traffic). This is not expected to occur in practice because of proper 
   allocation of bandwidth to priority traffic (or more precisely 
   because of proper sizing of the difference in bandwidth allocated to 
   non-priority traffic and bandwidth allocated to non-priority & 
   priority traffic).

3.  Admission Priority Policy Element 
    
   [RSVP-POLICY] defines extensions for supporting generic policy based 
   admission control in RSVP. These extensions include the standard 
   format of POLICY_DATA objects and a description of RSVP handling of 
   policy events.  
    
   The POLICY_DATA object contains one or more of Policy Elements, each 
   representing a different (and perhaps orthogonal) policy. As an 
   example [RSVP-PREEMP] specifies the Preemption Priority Policy 
   Element.

                  Admission Priority Policy Element      October 2005 
 
 
   This document defines a new Policy Element called the Admission 
   Priority Policy Element. 
    
   The format of Admission Priority policy element is as follows: 
    
         +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ 
         | Length (12)               | P-Type = ADMISSION_PRI    | 
         +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ 
         | Flags       | M. Strategy | Error Code  | Reserved(0) | 
         +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ 
         | Admission  Priority       | Reserved (0)              | 
         +---------------------------+---------------------------+ 
    
    
   Length: 16 bits 
      Always 12. The overall length of the policy element, in bytes. 
    
   P-Type: 16 bits 
       ADMISSION_PRI  = To be allocated by IANA  
      (see "IANA Considerations" section) 
    
   Flags: 8 bits 
       Reserved (always 0). 
    
   Merge Strategy: 8 bit 
       1    Take priority of highest QoS: recommended 
       2    Take highest priority: aggressive 
       3    Force Error on heterogeneous merge 
    
   Error code: 8 bits 
       0  NO_ERROR        Value used for regular ADMISSION_PRI elements 
       2  HETEROGENEOUS   This element encountered heterogeneous merge 
    
   Reserved: 8 bits 
       Always 0. 
    
   Admission Priority: 16 bit (unsigned) 
       The admission control priority of the flow, in terms of access 
       to resources set aside in order to provide higher probability of 
       call completion to selected flows. Higher values represent 
       higher Priority. A reservation established without an Admission 
       Priority policy element is equivalent to a reservation 
       established with an Admission Priority policy element whose 
       Admission Priority value is 0.  
        
   Reserved: 16 bits 
       Always 0.

4.  Admission Priority Merging Rules 
    
   This session discusses alternatives for dealing with RSVP admission 
   priority in case of merging of reservations. As merging is only 
   applicable to multicast, this section also only applies to multicast 
   sessions. 
    
4.1.  Admission Priority Merging Strategies 
    
   In merging situations Local Decision Points (LDPs) may receive 
   multiple preemption elements and must compute the admission priority 
   of the merged flow according to the following rules: 
    
       a. Participating admission priority elements are selected. 
   All admission priority elements are examined according to their 
   merging strategy to decide whether they should participate in the 
   merged result (as specified below). 
    
       b. The highest admission priority of all participating admission 
   priority elements is computed. 
    
   The remainder of this section describes the different merging 
   strategies the can be specified in the ADMISSION_PRI element. 
    
4.1.1. 
      Take priority of highest QoS 
    
   The ADMISSION_PRI element would participate in the merged reservation 
   only if it belongs to a flow that contributed to the merged QoS level 
   (i.e., that its QoS requirement does not constitute a subset of 
   another reservation.)  A simple way to determine whether a flow 
   contributed to the merged QoS result is to compute the merged QoS 
   with and without it and to compare the results (although this is 
   clearly not the most efficient method). 
    
   The reasoning for this approach is that the highest QoS flow is the 
   one dominating the merged reservation and as such its priority should 
   dominate it as well.  
    
4.1.2. 
      Take highest priority 
    
   All ADMISSION_PRI elements participate in the merged reservation. 
    
   This strategy disassociates priority and QoS level, and therefore is 
   highly subject to free-riders and its inverse image, denial of 
   service. 
    
4.1.3. 
      Force error on heterogeneous merge 
    
   A ADMISSION_PRI element may participate in a merged reservation only 
 
 
Le Faucheur, et al.                                         [Page 11] 

                  Admission Priority Policy Element      October 2005 
 
 
   if all other flows in the merged reservation have the same QoS level 
   (homogeneous flows). 
    
   The reasoning for this approach assumes that the heterogeneous case 
   is relatively rare and too complicated to deal with, thus it better 
   be prohibited. 
    
   This strategy lends itself to denial of service, when a single 
   receiver specifying a non-compatible QoS level may cause denial of 
   service for all other receivers of the merged reservation. 
    
   Note: The determination of heterogeneous flows applies to QoS level 
   only (FLOWSPEC values), and is a matter for local (LDP) definition. 
   Other types of heterogeneous reservations (e.g. conflicting 
   reservation styles) are handled by RSVP and are unrelated to this 
   ADMISSION_PRI element. 
    
4.2.  Modifying Admission Priority Elements 
    
   When POLICY_DATA objects are protected by integrity, LDPs should not   
   attempt to modify them. They must be forwarded as-is or else their 
   security envelope would be invalidated. In other cases, LDPs may 
   modify and merge incoming ADMISSION _PRI elements to reduce their 
   size and number according to the following rule: 
    
   Merging is performed for each merging strategy separately. 
    
   There is no known algorithm to merge ADMISSION_PRI element of 
   different merging strategies without losing valuable information that 
   may affect OTHER nodes. 
    
      -  For each merging strategy, the highest QoS of all participating 
         ADMISSION _PRI elements is taken and is placed in an outgoing 
         ADMISSION _PRI element of this merging strategy. 
    
      -  This approach effectively compresses the number of forwarded 
         ADMISSION _PRI elements to at most to the number of different 
         merging strategies, regardless of the number of receivers. 
    
 
5.  Error Processing 
    
   An Error Code is sent back (inside the Admission Priority Policy 
   Element) toward the appropriate receivers when an error involving 
   ADMISSION_PRI elements occur. 
    
      Heterogeneity 
       

 
 
Le Faucheur, et al.                                         [Page 12] 

                  Admission Priority Policy Element      October 2005 
 
 
      When a flow F1 with "Force Error on heterogeneous merge" merging 
      strategy set in its ADMISSION_PRI element encounters 
      heterogeneity, the ADMISSION_PRI element is sent back toward 
      receivers with the Heterogeneity error code set. 
 
    
6.  Security Considerations 
    
   The integrity of ADMISSION_PRI is guaranteed, as any other policy 
   element, by the encapsulation into a Policy Data object [RSVP-POLICY]. 
    
    
7.  IANA Considerations  
    
   As specified in [POLICY-RSVP], Standard RSVP Policy Elements (P-type 
   values) are to be assigned by IANA as per "IETF Consensus" following 
   the policies outlined in [IANA-CONSIDERATIONS]. 
    
   IANA needs to allocate a P-Type from the Standard RSVP Policy Element 
   range to the Admission Priority Policy Element.
