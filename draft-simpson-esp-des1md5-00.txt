1.  Introduction

   The Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) [RFC-1827] provides confi-
   dentiality for IP datagrams by encrypting the payload data to be pro-
   tected.  Some transforms may also provide integrity.

   This specification describes the ESP use of the Cipher Block Chaining
   (CBC) mode of the US Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm
   [FIPS-46, FIPS-46-1, FIPS-74, FIPS-81], together with Message Digest
   5 (MD5) [RFC-1321].

   The usual combination of ESP and AH [RFC-1826] can do this task just
   as well.  The primary benefit of this transform is that it saves 4
   octets.

   This document assumes that the reader is familiar with the related
   document "Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol"
   [RFC-1825], that defines the overall security plan for IP, and pro-
   vides important background for this specification.


1.1.  Keys

   There are two keys used by this transform.

   The secret DES key shared between the communicating parties is eight
   octets (64-bits) in length.  This key consists of a 56-bit quantity
   used by the DES algorithm.  The 56-bit key is stored as a 64-bit
   quantity, with the least significant bit of each octet used as a par-
   ity bit.

   The secret MD5 key shared between the communicating parties SHOULD be
   a cryptographically strong random number, not a guessable string of
   any sort.

   The MD5 key is not constrained by this transform to any particular
   size.  Lengths of up to 128-bits MUST be supported by the implementa-
   tion, although any particular key may be shorter.  Longer keys are
   encouraged.

   Implementation Notes:

      It is recommended that the two keys be unrelated, to prevent
      attacks exploiting mathematical relationships between the differ-
      ent algorithms that might reveal some portion of the session-
      key(s).  Never-the-less, there is no known interaction between MD5
      and DES-CBC.

1.2.  Initialization Vector

   This mode of DES requires an Initialization Vector (IV) that is eight
   octets (64-bits) in length.

   Each datagram contains its own IV.  Including the IV in each datagram
   ensures that decryption of each received datagram can be performed,
   even when other datagrams are dropped, or datagrams are re-ordered in
   transit.

   The SPI is used for the most significant four octets of the IV.  The
   method for selection of the least significant four octets of the IV
   is implementation dependent.

   Then, this IV is hashed before use.  The MD5 hash is calculated over
   the following concatenated values:

    + the DES key (8 octets including parity bits),
    + the SPI (4 octets),
    + the IV (4 octets),
    + the MD5 key (variable length).

   The most significant 64-bits of the generated hash are used for the
   final IV.

   Implementation Notes:
      A common technique for the least significant four octets of the IV
      is simply a counter, beginning with a randomly chosen value.  This
      provides an easy method for preventing repetition, and is suffi-
      ciently robust for practical use.

      Other implementations exhibit unpredictability, usually through a
      pseudo-random number generator.  Care should be taken that the
      periodicity of the number generator is long enough to prevent rep-
      etition during the lifetime of the session key.


1.3.  Data Size

   The DES algorithm operates on blocks of eight octets (64-bits).  This
   often requires padding after the end of the unencrypted payload data.

   Both input and output result in the same number of octets.  This
   facilitates in-place encryption and decryption.

   MD5's 128-bit output is naturally 64-bit aligned.  There is no fur-
   ther padding of the Authentication Data field.

   On receipt, if the length of the data to be decrypted is not an inte-
   gral multiple of eight octets, then an error is indicated, as
   described in [RFC-1825].


1.4.  Performance

   In general, DES software speeds are considerably slower than MD5
   software, while DES hardware is considerably faster than MD5 hard-
   ware.

   MD5 software speeds are adequate for commonly deployed LAN and WAN
   links, but reportedly are too slow for newer link technologies
   [RFC-1810].

   One of the authors (Karn) has tuned DES software to achieve 10.45
   Mbps with a 90 MHz Pentium.  Other DES speed estimates may be found
   at [Schneier95, p 279].

   Security Parameters Index (SPI)
                    4 octets.  Identifies the Security Parameters for
                    this datagram.  The value MUST NOT be zero.

   Initialization Vector (IV)
                    4 octets.  Provides a seed for calculating the final
                    IV, as described earlier.

   Payload Data     variable.

                    Prior to encryption and after decryption, this field
                    begins with the IP Protocol/Payload header specified
                    in the Payload Type field.  Note that in the case of
                    IP-in-IP encapsulation (Payload Type 4), this will
                    be another IP header.

   Padding          variable.

                    Prior to encryption, it is filled with unspecified
                    implementation dependent (preferably random) values,
                    to align the Pad Length and Payload Type fields at
                    an eight octet boundary.

                    After decryption, it MUST be ignored.

   Pad Length       1 octet.  Indicates the size of the Padding field.
                    It does not include the Pad Length and Payload Type
                    fields.  The value typically ranges from 0 to 7, but
                    may be up to 255 to permit hiding of the actual data

                    length.

                    This field is opaque.  That is, the value is set
                    prior to encryption, and is examined only after
                    decryption.

   Payload Type     1 octet.  Indicates the contents of the Payload Data
                    field, using the IP Protocol/Payload value.  Up-to-
                    date values of the IP Protocol/Payload are specified
                    in the most recent "Assigned Numbers" [RFC-1700].

                    This field is opaque.  That is, the value is set
                    prior to encryption, and is examined only after
                    decryption.

                    For example, when encrypting an entire IP datagram
                    (Tunnel-Mode), this field will contain the value 4,
                    indicating IP-in-IP encapsulation.

   Authentication Data
                    16 octets.  Filled with the result of the MD5 calcu-
                    lation.

3.  Algorithm

   In DES-CBC, each plaintext block is XOR'd with the previous cipher-
   text block, and the DES encryption function is applied to yield the
   ciphertext for the current block.  This provides for re-
   synchronization when datagrams are lost.

   For more explanation and implementation information for DES, see
   [Schneier95].


3.1.  Encryption

   Append zero or more octets of (preferably random) padding to the
   plaintext, to make its modulo 8 length equal to 6.  For example, if
   the plaintext length is 41, 5 octets of padding are added.

   Append a Pad Length octet containing the number of padding octets
   just added.

   Append a Payload Type octet containing the IP Protocol/Payload value
   identifying the protocol header that begins the payload.

   Provide an appropriate Initialization Vector (IV), as described ear-
   lier.

   Encrypt the payload with DES in CBC mode, producing a ciphertext of
   the same length.

   Octets are mapped to DES blocks in network order (most significant
   octet first) [RFC-1700].  Octet 0 (modulo 8) of the payload corre-
   sponds to bits 1-8 of the 64-bit DES input block, while octet 7 (mod-
   ulo 8) corresponds to bits 57-64 of the DES input block.

   Add the indicated SPI and IV seed in front of the Payload Data.

   Append the Authentication Data, calculated over the SPI, IV, Payload
   Data, padding, Pad Length, and Payload Type.

   Construct an appropriate IP datagram for the target Destination.  The
   Total/Payload Length in the encapsulating IP Header reflects the
   length of the encrypted data, plus the SPI, IV, padding, Pad Length,
   Payload Type, and Authentication Data.

3.2.  Decryption

   First, the SPI field is examined.  This is used as an index into the
   local Security Parameter table to find the negotiated parameters and
   decryption key.

   The Authentication Data is verified and removed.

   The SPI and IV fields are removed, and an appropriate 64-bit IV value
   is constructed.

   The encrypted part of the payload is decrypted using DES in the CBC
   mode.

   The Payload Type is removed and examined.  If it is unrecognized, the
   payload is discarded with an appropriate ICMP message.

   The Pad Length is removed and examined.  The specified number of pad
   octets are removed from the end of the decrypted payload, and the IP
   Total/Payload Length is adjusted accordingly.

   The IP Header(s) and the remaining portion of the decrypted payload
   are passed to the protocol receive routine specified by the Payload
   Type field.


3.3.  Authentication

   The 128-bit digest is calculated as described in [RFC-1321].  The
   specification of MD5 includes a portable 'C' programming language
   description of the MD5 algorithm.

   The form of the authenticated message is

      MD5( key, keyfill, MD5( key, keyfill, data, MD5fill), MD5fill )

   First, the variable length secret authentication key is filled to the
   next 512-bit boundary, using the same pad with length technique
   defined for MD5.

   Second, the filled key is concatenated with (immediately followed by)
   the SPI, IV, Payload Data, padding, Pad Length, and Payload Type.

   A trailing pad with length to the next 512-bit boundary for the
   entire message is added by MD5 itself.  The 128-bit MD5 digest is
   calculated.

   Third, the filled key is again concatenated with (immediately



Karn, Metzger & Simpson   expires in six months                 [Page 7]
DRAFT                        ESP DES-CBC-MD5               December 1995


   followed by) the previous digest.

   A trailing pad with length to the next 512-bit boundary for the
   entire message is added by MD5 itself.  The 128-bit MD5 digest is
   calculated, and the result is inserted into the Authentication Data
   field.

   Discussion:
      The leading copy of the key is padded in order to facilitate copy-
      ing of the key at machine boundaries without requiring re-
      alignment of the following datagram.  The padding technique
      includes a length that protects arbitrary length keys.  Filling to
      the MD5 block size also allows the key to be prehashed to avoid
      the physical copy in some implementations.  It is further sug-
      gested that this might protect against some forms of cryptanaly-
      sis, although no such weakness is yet known in keyed MD5 [KR95].

      When the implementation adds the keys and padding in place before
      and after the IP datagram, care must be taken that the keys and/or
      padding are not sent over the link by the link driver.


Security Considerations

   Users need to understand that the quality of the security provided by
   this specification depends completely on the strength of the DES and
   MD5 algorithms, the correctness of the algorithm's implementation,
   the security of the key management mechanism and its implementation,
   the strength of the key [CN94], and upon the correctness of the
   implementations in all of the participating nodes.

   MD5

      At the time of writing of this document, it is known to be possi-
      ble to produce collisions in the compression function of MD5
      [dBB93].  There is not yet a known method to exploit these colli-
      sions to attack MD5 in practice, but this fact is disturbing to
      some authors [Schneier95].

      It has also recently been determined [vOW94] that it is possible
      to build a machine for $10 Million that could find two chosen text
      variants with a common MD5 hash value.  However, it is unclear
      whether this attack is applicable to a keyed MD5 transform.

      This attack requires approximately 24 days.  The same form of
      attack is useful on any iterated n-bit hash function, and the time
      is entirely due to the 128-bit length of the MD5 hash.




Karn, Metzger & Simpson   expires in six months                 [Page 8]
DRAFT                        ESP DES-CBC-MD5               December 1995


      Although there is no substantial weakness for most IP security
      applications, it should be recognized that current technology is
      catching up to the 128-bit hash length used by MD5.  Applications
      requiring extremely high levels of security may wish to move in
      the near future to algorithms with longer hash lengths.

   DES

      Among other considerations, applications may wish to take care not
      to select weak keys, although the odds of picking one at random
      are low [Schneier95, p 280].

      The cut and paste attack described by [Bell95] exploits the nature
      of all Cipher Block Chaining algorithms.  When a block is damaged
      in transmission, on decryption both it and the following block
      will be garbled by the decryption process, but all subsequent
      blocks will be decrypted correctly.  If an attacker has legitimate
      access to the same key, this feature can be used to insert or
      replay previously encrypted data of other users of the same
      engine, revealing the plaintext.  The usual (ICMP, TCP, UDP)
      transport checksum can detect this attack, but on its own is not
      considered cryptographically strong.  In this situation, user or
      connection oriented integrity checking is needed [RFC-1826].

      At the time of writing of this document, [BS93] demonstrated a
      differential cryptanalysis based chosen-plaintext attack requiring
      2^47 plaintext-ciphertext pairs, and [Matsui94] demonstrated a
      linear cryptanalysis based known-plaintext attack requiring only
      2^43 plaintext-ciphertext pairs.  Although these attacks are not
      considered practical, they must be taken into account.

      More disturbingly, [Weiner94] has shown the design of a DES crack-
      ing machine costing $1 Million that can crack one key every 3.5
      hours.  This is an extremely practical attack.

      One or two blocks of known plaintext suffice to recover a DES key.
      Because IP datagrams typically begin with a block of known and/or
      guessable header text, frequent key changes will not protect
      against this attack.

      It is suggested that DES is not a good encryption algorithm for
      the protection of even moderate value information in the face of
      such equipment.  Triple DES is probably a better choice for such
      purposes.

      However, despite these potential risks, the level of privacy pro-
      vided by use of ESP DES-CBC in the Internet environment is far
      greater than sending the datagram as cleartext.

Acknowledgements

   Some of the text of this specification was derived from work by Ran-
   dall Atkinson for the SIP, SIPP, and IPv6 Working Groups.

   This basic concept and use of DES and MD5 are derived in large part
   from the work done for SNMPv2 [RFC-1446].

   Bart Preneel suggested the hash protection of the IV, to render it
   impossible to correlate with subsequent IVs.

   The message authentication mechanism is based on one of the variants
   discussed in [KR95].
