Abstract 
 
   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) control allows 
   each network element (NE) to perform local resource discovery, 
   routing and signaling in a distributed manner.  

   On the other hand, with the development of software-defined 
   transport networking technology, a set of NEs can be controlled via 
   centralized controller hierarchies to address the issue from multi-
   domain, multi-vendor and multi-technology. An example of such 
   centralized architecture is ACTN controller hierarchy described in 
   RFC 8453.   

   Instead of competing with each other, both the distributed and the 
   centralized control plane have their own advantages, and should be 
   complementary in the system. This document describes how the GMPLS 
   distributed control plane can interwork with a centralized 
   controller system in a transport network.

1. Introduction 

   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) [RFC3945] extends 
   MPLS to support different classes of interfaces and switching 
   capabilities such as Time-Division Multiplex Capable (TDM), Lambda 
   Switch Capable (LSC), and Fiber-Switch Capable (FSC). Each network 
   element (NE) running a GMPLS control plane collects network 
   information from other NEs and supports service provisioning through 
   signaling in a distributed manner. More generic description for 
   Traffic-engineering networking information exchange can be found in 
   [RFC7926].  

   On the other hand, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) technologies 
   have been introduced to control the transport network in a 
   centralized manner. Centralized controllers can collect network 
   information from each node and provision services to corresponding 
   nodes. One of the examples is the Abstraction and Control of Traffic 
   Engineered Networks (ACTN) [RFC8453], which defines a hierarchical 
   architecture with Provisioning Network Controller (PNC), Multi-
   domain Service Coordinator (MDSC) and Customer Network Controller 
   (CNC) as centralized controllers for different network abstraction 
   levels. A Path Computation Element (PCE) based approach has been 
   proposed as Application-Based Network Operations (ABNO) in 
   [RFC7491].  

   In such centralized controller architectures, GMPLS can be applied 
   for the NE-level control. A centralized controller may support GMPLS 
   enabled domains and may interact with a GMPLS enabled domain where 
   the GMPLS control plane does the service provisioning from ingress 
   to egress. In this case the centralized controller sends the request

   to the ingress node and does not have to configure all NEs along the 
   path through the domain from ingress to egress thus leveraging the 
   GMPLS control plane. This document describes how GMPLS control 
   interworks with centralized controller system in transport network. 

2. Overview 

   In this section, overviews of GMPLS control plane and centralized 
   controller system are discussed as well as the interactions between 
   the GMPLS control plane and centralized controllers. 

2.1. Overview of GMPLS Control Plane 

   GMPLS separates the control plane and the data plane to support 
   time-division, wavelength, and spatial switching, which are 
   significant in transport networks. For the NE level control in 
   GMPLS, each node runs a GMPLS control plane instance. 
   Functionalities such as service provisioning, protection, and 
   restoration can be performed via GMPLS communication among multiple 
   NEs. At the same time, the controller can also collect node and link 
   resources in the network to construct the network topology and 
   compute routing paths for serving service requests. 

   Several protocols have been designed for GMPLS control [RFC3945] 
   including link management [RFC4204], signaling [RFC3471], and 
   routing [RFC4202] protocols. The controllers applying these 
   protocols communicate with each other to exchange resource 
   information and establish Label Switched Paths (LSPs). In this way, 
   controllers in different nodes in the network have the same view of 
   the network topology and provision services based on local policies. 

2.2. Overview of Centralized Controller System 

   With the development of SDN technologies, a centralized controller 
   architecture has been introduced to transport networks. One example 
   architecture can be found in ACTN [RFC8453]. In such systems, a 
   controller is aware of the network topology and is responsible for 
   provisioning incoming service requests.  

   Multiple hierarchies of controllers are designed at different levels 
   implementing different functions. This kind of architecture enables 
   multi-vendor, multi-domain, and multi-technology control. For 
   example, a higher-level controller coordinates several lower-level 
   controllers controlling different domains, for topology collection 
   and service provisioning. Vendor-specific features can be abstracted 
   between controllers, and standard API (e.g., generated from 
   RESTconf/YANG) is used.

2.3. GMPLS Control Interwork with Centralized Controller System 

   Besides the GMPLS and the interactions among the controller 
   hierarchies, it is also necessary for the controllers to communicate 
   with the network elements. Within each domain, GMPLS control can be 
   applied to each NE. The bottom-level centralized controller can act 
   as a NE to collect network information and initiate LSP. Figure 1 
   shows an example of GMPLS interworking with centralized controllers 
   (ACTN terminologies are used in the figure).

      Figure 1: Example of GMPLS/non-GMPLS interworks with Controllers 

   Figure 1 shows the scenario with two GMPLS domains and one non-GMPLS 
   domain. This system supports the interworking among non-GMPLS 
   domain, GMPLS domain and the controller hierarchies. For domain 1, 
   the network element were not enabled with GMPLS so the control can 
   be purely from the controller, via Netconf/YANG and/or PCEP. For 
   domains 2 and 3, each domain has the GMPLS control plane enabled at 
   the physical network level. The PNC can exploit GMPLS capability 
   implemented in the domain to listen to the IGP routing protocol 
   messages (OSPF LSAs for example) that the GMPLS control plane 
   instances are disseminating into the network and thus learn the 
   network topology. For path computation in the domain with PNC

   implementing a PCE, PCCs (e.g. NEs, other controller/PCE) use PCEP 
   to ask the PNC for a path and get replies. The MDSC communicates 
   with PNCs using for example REST/RESTConf based on YANG data models. 
   As a PNC has learned its domain topology, it can report the topology 
   to the MDSC. When a service arrives, the MDSC computes the path and 
   coordinates PNCs to establish the corresponding LSP segment. 

   Alternatively, the NETCONF protocol can be used to retrieve topology 
   information utilizing the e.g. [RFC8795] Yang model and the 
   technology-specific YANG model augmentations required for the 
   specific network technology. The PNC can retrieve topology 
   information from any NE (the GMPLS control plane instance of each NE 
   in the domain has the same topological view), construct the topology 
   of the domain and export an abstracted view to the MDSC. Based on 
   the topology retrieved from multiple PNCs, the MDSC can create 
   topology graph of the multi-domain network, and can use it for path 
   computation. To setup a service, the MDSC can exploit e.g. [TE-
   Tunnel] Yang model together with the technology-specific YANG model 
   augmentations.  

   This document focuses on the interworking between the GMPLS and the 
   centralized controller system, including: 

   -  The interworking between the GMPLS domain(s) and the centralized 
      controller(s) (including the orchestrator, if exists) controlling 
      the GMPLS domain(s). 

   -  The interworking between a non-GMPLS domain (which is controlled 
      by a centralized controller system) and a GMPLS domain, through 
      the controller hierarchy architecture. 

   For convenience, this document uses the following terminologies for 
   the controller and the orchestrator:  

   -  Controller(G): A domain controller controlling a GMPLS domain (the 
      controller(G) of the GMPLS domains 2 and 3 in Figure 1); 

   -  Controller(N): A domain controller controlling a non-GMPLS domain 
      (the controller(N) of the non-GMPLS domain 1 in Figure 1); 

   -  H-Controller(G): A domain controller controlling the higher-layer 
      GMPLS domain, in the context of multi-layer networks; 

   -  L-Controller(G): A domain controller controlling the lower-layer 
      GMPLS domain, in the context of multi-layer networks; 

   -  H-Controller(N): A domain controller controlling the higher-layer 
      non-GMPLS domain, in the context of multi-layer networks;

   -  L-Controller(N): A domain controller controlling the lower-layer 
      non-GMPLS domain, in the context of multi-layer networks; 

   -  Orchestrator(MD): An orchestrator used to orchestrate the multi-
      domain networks; 

   -  Orchestrator(ML): An orchestrator used to orchestrate the multi-
      layer networks. 

3. Discovery Options 

   In GMPLS control, the link connectivity need to be verified between 
   each pair of nodes. In this way, link resources, which are 
   fundamental resources in the network, are discovered by both ends of 
   the link. 

3.1. LMP 

   Link management protocol (LMP) [RFC4204] runs between a pair of 
   nodes and is used to manage TE links. In addition to the setup and 
   maintenance of control channels, LMP can be used to verify the data 
   link connectivity and correlate the link property.  

4. Routing Options 

   In GMPLS control, link state information is flooded within the 
   network as defined in [RFC4202]. Each node in the network can build 
   the network topology according to the flooded link state 
   information. Routing protocols such as OSPF-TE [RFC4203] and ISIS-TE 
   [RFC5307] have been extended to support different interfaces in 
   GMPLS. 

   In centralized controller system, centralized controller can be 
   placed at the GMPLS network and passively receive the information 
   flooded in the network. In this way, the centralized controller can 
   construct and update the network topology.  

4.1. OSPF-TE 

   OSPF-TE is introduced for TE networks in [RFC3630]. OSPF extensions 
   have been defined in [RFC4203] to enable the capability of link 
   state information for GMPLS network. Based on this work, OSPF 
   protocol has been extended to support technology-specific routing. 
   The routing protocol for OTN, WSON and optical flexi-grid network 
   are defined in [RFC7138], [RFC7688] and [RFC8363], respectively. 

4.2. ISIS-TE 

   ISIS-TE is introduced for TE networks in [RFC5305] and is extended 
   to support GMPLS routing functions [RFC5307], and has been updated 
 
Zheng et. al           Expires September 2022                 [Page 7] 

Internet-Draft        GMPLS and Controller Interwork        March 2022 


   to [RFC7074] to support the latest GMPLS switching capability and 
   Types fields. 

4.3. Netconf/RESTconf 

   Netconf [RFC6241] and RESTconf [RFC8040] protocols are originally 
   used for network configuration. Besides, these protocols can also be 
   used for topology retrieval by using topology-related YANG models, 
   such as [RFC8345] and [RFC8795]. These protocols provide a powerful 
   mechanism for notification that permits to notify the client about 
   topology changes.  

5. Path Computation 

   Once a controller learns the network topology, it can utilize the 
   available resources to serve service requests by performing path 
   computation. Due to abstraction, the controllers may not have 
   sufficient information to compute the optimal path. In this case, 
   the controller can interact with other controllers by sending Yang 
   Path Computation requests [PAT-COMP] to compute a set of potential 
   optimal paths and then, based on its own constraints, policy and 
   specific knowledge (e.g. cost of access link) can choose the more 
   feasible path for service e2e path setup.  

   Path computation is one of the key objectives in various types of 
   controllers. In the given architecture, it is possible for different 
   components that have the capability to compute the path.  

5.1. Constraint-based Path Computing in GMPLS Control 

   In GMPLS control, a routing path is computed by the ingress node 
   [RFC3473] and is based on the ingress node TED. Constraint-based 
   path computation is performed according to the local policy of the 
   ingress node. 

5.2. Path Computation Element (PCE) 

   PCE has been introduced in [RFC4655] as a functional component that 
   provides services to compute path in a network. In [RFC5440], the 
   path computation is accomplished by using the Traffic Engineering 
   Database (TED), which maintains the link resources in the network. 
   The emergence of PCE efficiently improve the quality of network 
   planning and offline computation, but there is a risk that the 
   computed path may be infeasible if there is a diversity requirement, 
   because stateless PCE has no knowledge about the former computed 
   paths.  

   To address this issue, stateful PCE has been proposed in [RFC8231]. 
   Besides the TED, an additional LSP Database (LSP-DB) is introduced 
   to archive each LSP computed by the PCE. In this way, PCE can easily 
 
Zheng et. al           Expires September 2022                 [Page 8] 

Internet-Draft        GMPLS and Controller Interwork        March 2022 


   figure out the relationship between the computing path and former 
   computed paths. In this approach, PCE provides computed paths to 
   PCC, and then PCC decides which path is deployed and when to be 
   established.  

   In PCE Initiation [RFC8281], PCE is allowed to trigger the PCC to 
   setup, maintenance, and teardown of the PCE-initiated LSP under the 
   stateful PCE model. This would allow a dynamic network that is 
   centrally controlled and deployed. 

   In centralized controller system, the PCE can be implemented in a 
   centralized controller, and the centralized controller performs path 
   computation according to its local policies. On the other hand, the 
   PCE can also be placed outside of the centralized controller. In 
   this case, the centralized controller acts as a PCC to request path 
   computation to the PCE through PCEP. One of the reference 
   architecture can be found at [RFC7491].  

6. Signaling Options 

   Signaling mechanisms are used to setup LSPs in GMPLS control. 
   Messages are sent hop by hop between the ingress node and the egress 
   node of the LSP to allocate labels. Once the labels are allocated 
   along the path, the LSP setup is accomplished. Signaling protocols 
   such as RSVP-TE [RFC3473] have been extended to support different 
   interfaces in GMPLS. 

6.1. RSVP-TE 

   RSVP-TE is introduced in [RFC3209] and extended to support GMPLS 
   signaling in [RFC3473]. Several label formats are defined for a 
   generalized label request, a generalized label, suggested label and 
   label sets. Based on [RFC3473], RSVP-TE has been extended to support 
   technology-specific signaling. The RSVP-TE extensions for OTN, WSON, 
   optical flexi-grid network are defined in [RFC7139], [RFC7689], and 
   [RFC7792], respectively. 

7. Interworking Scenarios 

7.1. Topology Collection & Synchronization 

   Topology information is necessary on both network elements and 
   controllers. The topology on network element is usually raw 
   information, while the topology on the controller can be either raw 
   or abstracted. Three different abstraction methods have been 
   described in [RFC8453], and different controllers can select the 
   corresponding method depending on application.  

   When there are changes in the network topology, the impacted network 
   element(s) need to report changes to all the other network elements,

   together with the controller, to sync up the topology information. 
   The inter-NE synchronization can be achieved via protocols mentioned 
   in Sections 3 and 4. The topology synchronization between NEs and 
   controllers can either be achieved by routing protocols OSPF-
   TE/PCEP-LS in [PCEP-LS] or Netconf protocol notifications with YANG 
   model.  

7.2. Multi-domain Service Provisioning 

   Based on the topology information on controllers and network 
   elements, service provisioning can be deployed. Plenty of methods 
   have been specified for single domain service provisioning, such as 
   using PCEP and RSVP-TE.  

   Multi-domain service provisioning would request coordination among 
   the controller hierarchies. Given the service request, the end-to-
   end delivery procedure may include interactions at any level (i.e. 
   interface) in the hierachy of the controllers (e.g. MPI and SBI for 
   ACTN). The computation for a cross-domain path is usually completed 
   by controllers who have a global view of the topologies. Then the 
   configuration is decomposed into lower-level controllers, to 
   configure the network elements to set up the path.  

   A combination of the centralized and distributed protocols may be 
   necessary for the interaction between network elements and 
   controller. Several methods can be used to create the inter-domain 
   path: 

   1) With end-to-end RSVP-TE session:  

   In this method, all the domains need to support the RSVP-TE protocol 
   and thus need to be GMPLS domains. The Controller(G) of the source 
   domain triggers the source node to create the end-to-end RSVP-TE 
   session, and the assignment and distribution of the labels on the 
   inter-domain links are done by the boarder nodes of each domain, 
   using RSVP-TE protocol. Therefore, this method requires the 
   interworking of RSVP-TE protocols between different domains. 

   There are two possible methods: 

   1.1) One single end-to-end RSVP-TE session 

   In this method, an end-to-end RSVP-TE session from the source node 
   to the destination node will be used to create the inter-domain 
   path. A typical example would be the PCE Initiation scenario, in 
   which a PCE message (PCInitiate) is sent from the controller(G) to 
   the source node, and then trigger an RSVP procedure along the path. 
   Similarly, the interaction between the controller and the source 
   node of the source domain can be achieved by Netconf protocol with

   corresponding YANG models, and then completed by running RSVP among 
   the network elements.  

   1.2) LSP Stitching 

   The LSP stitching method defined in [RFC5150] can also be used to 
   create the end-to-end LSP. I.e., when the source node receives an 
   end-to-end path creation request (e.g., using PCEP or Netconf 
   protocol), the source node starts an end-to-end RSVP-TE session 
   along the end points of each LSP segment (refers to S-LSP in 
   [RFC5150]) of each domain, to assign the labels on the inter-domain 
   links between each pair of neighbor S-LSPs, and stitch the end-to-
   end LSP to each S-LSP. See Figure 2 as an example. Note that the S-
   LSP in each domain can be either created by its Controller(G) in 
   advance, or created dynamically triggered by the end-to-end RSVP-TE 
   session.

   domain. Each controller (may be a Controller(G) or a Controller(N)) 
   is responsible to create the path segment within its domain. The

   boarder node does not need to communicate with other boarder nodes 
   in other domains for the distribution of labels on inter-domain 
   links, so end-to-end RSVP-TE session through multiple domains is not 
   required, and the interworking of RSVP-TE protocol between different 
   domains is not needed.  

   Note that path segments in the source domain and the destination 
   domain are "asymmetrical" segments, because the configuration of 
   client signal mapping into server layer tunnel is needed at only one 
   end of the segment, while configuration of server layer cross-
   connect is needed at the other end of the segment. For example, the 
   path segment 1 and 3 in Figure 3 are asymmetrical segments, because 
   one end of the segment requires mapping GE into ODU0, while the 
   other end of the segment requires setting up ODU0 cross-connect.

   asymmetrical segment. 

   Note also that mechanisms to assign the labels in the inter-domain 
   links are also needed to be considered. There are two possible 
   methods: 

   2.1) Inter-domain labels assigned by NEs: 

   The concept of Stitching Label that allows stitching local path

   segments was introduced in [RFC5150] and [sPCE-ID], in order to form 
   the inter-domain path crossing several different domains. It also 
   describes the BRPC and H-PCE PCInitiate procedure, i.e., the ingress 
   node of each downstream domain assigns the stitching label for the 
   inter-domain link between the downstream domain and its upstream 
   neighbor domain, and this stitching label will be passed to the 
   upstream neighbor domain by PCE protocol, which will be used for the 
   path segment creation in the upstream neighbor domain. 

   2.2) Inter-domain labels assigned by controller: 

   If the resource of inter-domain links are managed by the 
   orchestrator(MD), each domain controller can provide to the 
   orchestrator(MD) the list of available labels (e.g. timeslots if OTN 
   is the scenario) using IETF Topology model and related technology 
   specific extension. Once that the orchestrator(MD) has computed the 
   E2E path, RSVP-TE or PCEP can be used in the different domains to 
   setup related segment tunnel consisting with label inter-domain 
   information, e.g. for PCEP the label ERO can be included in the 
   PCInitiate message to indicate the inter-domain labels, so that each 
   boarder node of each domain can configure the correct cross-connect 
   within itself. 

7.3. Multi-layer Service Provisioning 

   GMPLS can interwork with centralized controller system in multi-
   layer networks.

   An example with two layers of network is shown in Figure 4. In this 
   example, the GMPLS control plane is enabled in at least one layer 
   network (otherwise it is out of scope of this document), and 
   interworks with the controller of its domain (H-Controller and L-
   Controller, respectively). The Orchestrator(ML) is used to 
   coordinate the control of the multi-layer network. 

7.3.1. Multi-layer Path Computation 

   [RFC5623] describes three inter-layer path computation models and 
   four inter-layer path control models:  

   -  3 Path computation: 

      o  Single PCE path computation model 

      o  Multiple PCE path computation with inter-PCE communication 
         model 

      o  Multiple PCE path computation without inter-PCE communication 
         model  

   -  4 Path control: 

      o  PCE-VNTM cooperation model 

      o  Higher-layer signaling trigger model 

      o  NMS-VNTM cooperation model (integrated flavor) 

      o  NMS-VNTM cooperation model (separate flavor) 

   Section 4.2.4 of [RFC5623] also provides all the possible 
   combinations of inter-layer path computation and inter-layer path 
   control models. 

   To apply [RFC5623] in multi-layer network with GMPLS-controller 
   interworking, the H-Controller and the L-Controller can act as the 
   PCE Hi and PCE Lo respectively, and typically, the Orchestrator(ML) 
   can act as a VNTM because it has the abstracted view of both the 
   higher-layer and lower-layer networks.  

   Table 1 shows all possible combinations of path computation and path 
   control models in multi-layer network with GMPLS-controller 
   interworking:

                 Not applicable because   Typical models to be used 
                 there are multiple PCEs 

   Note that: 

   -  Since there is one PCE in each layer network, the path computation 
      model "Single PCE path computation" is not applicable. 

   -  For the other two path computation models "Multiple PCE with 
      inter-PCE" and "Multiple PCE w/o inter-PCE", the possible 
      combinations are the same as defined in [RFC5623]. More 
      specifically: 

      o  The path control models "NMS-VNTM cooperation (integrated 
         flavor)" and "NMS-VNTM cooperation (separate flavor)" are the 
         typical models to be used in multi-layer network with GMPLS-
         controller interworking. This is because in these two models, 
         the path computation is triggered by the NMS or VNTM. And in 
         the centralized controller system, the path computation 
         requests are typically from the Orchestrator(ML) (acts as 
         VNTM).  

      o  For the other two path control models "PCE-VNTM cooperation" 
         and "Higher-layer signaling trigger", the path computation is 
         triggered by the NEs, i.e., NE performs PCC functions. These

         two models are still possible to be used, although they are not 
         the main methods. 

7.3.2. Cross-layer Path Creation 

   In a multi-layer network, a lower-layer LSP in the lower-layer 
   network can be created, which will construct a new link in the 
   higher-layer network. Such lower-layer LSP is called Hierarchical 
   LSP, or H-LSP for short, see [RFC6107]. 

   The new link constructed by the H-LSP then can be used by the 
   higher-layer network to create new LSPs. 

   As described in [RFC5212], two methods are introduced to create the 
   H-LSP: the static (pre-provisioned) method and the dynamic 
   (triggered) method. 

   1) Static (pre-provisioned) method 

   In this method, the H-LSP in the lower-layer network is created in 
   advance. After that, the higher-layer network can create LSPs using 
   the resource of the link constructed by the H-LSP. 

   The Orchestrator(ML) is responsible to decide the creation of H-LSP 
   in the lower-layer network if it acts as a VNTM. It then requests 
   the L-Controller to create the H-LSP via, for example, MPI interface 
   under the ACTN architecture. See Section 3.3.2 of [TE-Tunnel]. 

   If the lower-layer network is a GMPLS domain, the L-Controller(G) 
   can trigger the GMPLS control plane to create the H-LSP. As a 
   typical example, the PCInitiate message can be used for the 
   communication between the L-Controller and the source node of the H-
   LSP. And the source node of the H-LSP can trigger the RSVP-TE 
   signaling procedure to create the H-LSP, as described in [RFC6107]. 

   If the lower-layer network is a non-GMPLS domain, other methods may 
   be used by the L-Controller(N) to create the H-LSP, which is out of 
   scope of this document. 

   2) Dynamic (triggered) method 

   In this method, the signaling of LSP creation in the higher-layer 
   network will trigger the creation of H-LSP in the lower-layer 
   network dynamically, if it is necessary. Therefore, both the higher-
   layer and lower-layer networks need to support the RSVP-TE protocol 
   and thus need to be GMPLS domains. 

   In this case, after the cross-layer path is computed, the 
   Orchestrator(ML) requests the H-Controller(G) for the cross-layer

   LSP creation. As a typical example, the MPI interface under the ACTN 
   architecture could be used. 

   The H-Controller(G) can trigger the GMPLS control plane to create 
   the LSP in the higher-layer network. As a typical example, the 
   PCInitiate message can be used for the communication between the H-
   Controller(G) and the source node of the Higher-layer LSP, as 
   described in Section 4.3 of [RFC8282]. At least two sets of ERO 
   information should be included to indicate the routes of higher-
   layer LSP and lower-layer H-LSP. 

   The source node of the Higher-layer LSP follows the procedure 
   defined in Section 4 of [RFC6001], to trigger the GMPLS control 
   plane in both higher-layer network and lower-layer network to create 
   the higher-layer LSP and the lower-layer H-LSP. 

   On success, the source node of the H-LSP should report the 
   information of the H-LSP to the L-Controller(G) via, for example, 
   PCRpt message. 

7.3.3. Link Discovery 

   If the higher-layer network and the lower-layer network are under 
   the same GMPLS control plane instance, the H-LSP can be an FA-LSP. 
   Then the information of the link constructed by this FA-LSP, called 
   FA, can be advertised in the routing instance, so that the H-
   Controller can be aware of this new FA. [RFC4206] and the following 
   updates to it (including [RFC6001] and [RFC6107]) describe the 
   detail extensions to support advertisement of an FA. 

   If the higher-layer network and the lower-layer network are under 
   separated GMPLS control plane instances, or one of the both layer 
   networks is a non-GMPLS domain, after an H-LSP is created in the 
   lower-layer network, the link discovery procedure will be triggered 
   in the higher-layer network to discover the information of the link 
   constructed by the H-LSP. LMP protocol defined in [RFC4204] can be 
   used if the higher-layer network supports GMPLS. The information of 
   this new link will be advertised to the H-Controller. 

7.4. Recovery  

   The GMPLS recovery functions are described in [RFC4426]. Span 
   protection, end-to-end protection and restoration, are discussed 
   with different protection schemes and message exchange requirements. 
   Related RSVP-TE extensions to support end-to-end recovery is 
   described in [RFC4872]. The extensions in [RFC4872] include 
   protection, restoration, preemption, and rerouting mechanisms for an 
   end-to-end LSP. Besides end-to-end recovery, a GMPLS segment 
   recovery mechanism is defined in [RFC4873], which also intends to be 
   compatible with Fast Reroute (FRR) (see [RFC4090] which defines

   RSVP-TE extensions for the FRR mechanism, and [RFC8271] which 
   described the updates of GMPLS RSVP-TE protocol for FRR of GMPLS TE-
   LSPs). 

7.4.1. Span Protection 

   Span protection refers to the protection of the link between two 
   neighboring switches. The main protocol requirements include: 

   -  Link management: Link property correlation on the link protection 
      type; 

   -  Routing: announcement of the link protection type; 

   -  Signaling: indication of link protection requirement for that LSP. 

   GMPLS already supports the above requirements, and there are no new 
   requirements in the scenario of interworking between GMPLS and 
   centralized controller system. 

7.4.2. LSP Protection 

   The LSP protection includes end-to-end and segment LSP protection. 
   For both cases: 

   -  In the provisioning phase: 

      In both single-domain and multi-domain scenarios, the disjoint 
      path computation can be done by the centralized controller system, 
      as it has the global topology and resource view. And the path 
      creation can be done by the procedure described in Section 7.2. 

   -  In the protection switchover phase: 

      In both single-domain and multi-domain scenarios, the existing 
      standards provide the distributed way to trigger the protection 
      switchover. For example, data plane Automatic Protection Switching 
      (APS) mechanism described in [G.808.1], or GMPLS Notify mechanism 
      described in [RFC4872] and [RFC4873]. In the scenario of 
      interworking between GMPLS and centralized controller system, it 
      is recommended to still use these distributed mechanisms rather 
      than centralized mechanism (i.e., the controller triggers the 
      protection switchover). This can significantly shorten the 
      protection switching time. 

7.4.3. Single-domain LSP Restoration 

   -  Pre-planned LSP rerouting (including shared-mesh restoration):  


 
Zheng et. al           Expires September 2022                [Page 18] 

Internet-Draft        GMPLS and Controller Interwork        March 2022 


      In pre-planned protecting, the protecting LSP is established only 
      in the control plane in the provisioning phase, and will be 
      activated in the data plane once failure occurs. 

      In the scenario of interworking between GMPLS and centralized 
      controller system, the route of protecting LSP can be computed by 
      the centralized controller system. This takes the advantage of 
      making better use of network resource, especially for the resource 
      sharing in shared-mesh restoration. 

   -  Full LSP rerouting:  

      In full LSP rerouting, the normal traffic will be switched to an 
      alternate LSP that is fully established only after failure 
      occurrence. 

      As described in [RFC4872] and [RFC4873], the alternate route can 
      be computed on demand when failure occurrence, or pre-computed and 
      stored before failure occurrence.  

      In a fully distributed scenario, the pre-computation method offers 
      faster restoration time, but has the risk that the pre-computed 
      alternate route may become out of date due to the changes of the 
      network. 

      In the scenario of interworking between GMPLS and centralized 
      controller system, the pre-computation of the alternate route 
      could be taken place in the centralized controller (and may be 
      stored in the controller or the head-end node of the LSP). In this 
      way, any changes in the network can trigger the refreshment of the 
      alternate route by the centralized controller. This makes sure 
      that the alternate route will not become out of date. 

7.4.4. Multi-domain LSP Restoration 

   A working LSP may traverse multiple domains, each of which may or 
   may not support GMPLS distributed control plane. 

   In the case that all the domains support GMPLS, both the end-to-end 
   rerouting method and the domain segment rerouting method could be 
   used. 

   In the case that only some of the domains support GMPLS, the domain 
   segment rerouting method could be used in those GMPLS domains. For 
   other domains which do not support GMPLS, other mechanisms may be 
   used to protect the LSP segments, which are out of scope of this 
   document. 

   1) End-to-end rerouting: 

 
Zheng et. al           Expires September 2022                [Page 19] 

Internet-Draft        GMPLS and Controller Interwork        March 2022 


   In this case, failure occurs on the working LSP inside any domain or 
   on the inter-domain links will trigger the end-to-end restoration. 

   In both pre-planned and full LSP rerouting, the end-to-end 
   protecting LSP could be computed by the centralized controller 
   system, and could be created by the procedure described in Section 
   7.2. Note that the end-to-end protecting LSP may traverse different 
   domains from the working LSP, depending on the result of multi-
   domain path computation for the protecting LSP.

   2.1) Intra-domain rerouting:  

   If failure occurs on the working LSP segment in a GMPLS domain, the 
   segment rerouting ([RFC4873]) could be used for the working LSP 
   segment in that GMPLS domain. Figure 6 shows an example of intra-
   domain rerouting. 

   The intra-domain rerouting of a non-GMPLS domain is out of scope of 
   this document.

                 Figure 6: Intra-domain segment rerouting 

   2.2) Inter-domain rerouting:  

   If intra-domain segment rerouting failed (e.g., due to lack of 
   resource in that domain), or if failure occurs on the working LSP on 
   an inter-domain link, the centralized controller system may 
   coordinate with other domain(s), to find an alternative path or path 
   segment to bypass the failure, and then trigger the inter-domain 
   rerouting procedure. Note that the rerouting path or path segment 
   may traverse different domains from the working LSP. 

   The domains involved in the inter-domain rerouting procedure need to 
   be GMPLS domains, which support the RSVP-TE signaling for the 
   creation of rerouting LSP segment.  

   For inter-domain rerouting, the interaction between GMPLS and 
   centralized controller system is needed: 

   -  Report of the result of intra-domain segment rerouting to its 
      Controller(G), and then to the Orchestrator(MD). The former one 
      could be supported by the PCRpt message in [RFC8231], while the 
      latter one could be supported by the MPI interface of ACTN.

Internet-Draft        GMPLS and Controller Interwork        March 2022 


   -  Report of inter-domain link failure to the two Controllers (e.g., 
      Controller(G) 1 and Controller(G) 2 in Figure 7) by which the two 
      ends of the inter-domain link are controlled respectively, and 
      then to the Orchestrator(MD). The former one could be done as 
      described in Section 7.1 of this document, while the latter one 
      could be supported by the MPI interface of ACTN. 

   -  Computation of rerouting path or path segment crossing multi-
      domains by the centralized controller system (see [PAT-COMP]); 

   -  Creation of rerouting LSP segment in each related domain. The 
      Orchestrator(MD) can send the LSP segment rerouting request to the 
      source Controller(G) (e.g., Controller(G) 1 in Figure 7) via MPI 
      interface, and then the Controller(G) can trigger the creation of 
      rerouting LSP segment through multiple GMPLS domains using GMPLS 
      rerouting signaling. Note that the rerouting LSP segment may 
      traverse a new domain which the working LSP does not traverse 
      (e.g., Domain 3 in Figure 7).

7.4.5. Fast Reroute 

   [RFC4090] defines two methods of fast reroute, the one-to-one backup 
   method and the facility backup method. For both methods: 

   1) Path computation of protecting LSP: 

   In Section 6.2 of [RFC4090], the protecting LSP (detour LSP in one-
   to-one backup, or bypass tunnel in facility backup) could be 
   computed by the Point of Local Repair (PLR) using, for example, 
   Constraint-based Shortest Path First (CSPF) computation. In the 
   scenario of interworking between GMPLS and centralized controller 
   system, the protecting LSP could also be computed by the centralized 
   controller system, as it has the global view of the network 
   topology, resource and information of LSPs. 

   2) Protecting LSP creation: 

   In the scenario of interworking between GMPLS and centralized 
   controller system, the Protecting LSP could still be created by the 
   RSVP-TE signaling protocol as described in [RFC4090] and [RFC8271].  

   In addition, if the protecting LSP is computed by the centralized 
   controller system, the Secondary Explicit Route Object defined in 
   [RFC4873] could be used to explicitly indicate the route of the 
   protecting LSP. 

   3) Failure detection and traffic switchover: 

   If a PLR detects that failure occurs, it is recommended to still use 
   the distributed mechanisms described in [RFC4090] to switch the 
   traffic to the related detour LSP or bypass tunnel, rather than in a 
   centralized way. This can significantly shorten the protection 
   switching time. 

7.5. Controller Reliability  

   Given the important role in the network, the reliability of 
   controller is critical. Once a controller is shut down, the network 
   should operate as well. It can be either achieved by controller back 
   up or functionality back up. There are several of controller backup 
   or federation mechanisms in the literature. It is also more reliable 
   to have some function back up in the network element, to guarantee 
   the performance in the network.  

8. Manageability Considerations 

   Each entity in the network, including both controllers and network 
   elements, should be managed properly as it will interact with other 
   entities. The manageability considerations in controller hierarchies 
 
Zheng et. al           Expires September 2022                [Page 23] 

Internet-Draft        GMPLS and Controller Interwork        March 2022 


   and network elements still apply respectively. For the protocols 
   applied in the network, manageability is also requested.  

   The responsibility of each entity should be clarified. The control 
   of function and policy among different controllers should be 
   consistent via proper negotiation process.   

9. Security Considerations 

   This document provides the interwork between the GMPLS and 
   controller hierarchies. The security requirements in both system 
   still applies respectively. Protocols referenced in this document 
   also have various security considerations, which is also expected to 
   be satisfied.  

   Other considerations on the interface between the controller and the 
   network element are also important. Such security includes the 
   functions to authenticate and authorize the control access to the 
   controller from multiple network elements. Security mechanisms on 
   the controller are also required to safeguard the underlying network 
   elements against attacks on the control plane and/or unauthorized 
   usage of data transport resources.  

10. IANA Considerations 

   This document requires no IANA actions.
