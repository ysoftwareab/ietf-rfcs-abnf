            BGP-LS Extension for Inter-AS Topology Retrieval
             draft-ietf-idr-bgpls-inter-as-topology-ext-00

Abstract

   This document describes the process to build BGP-LS key parameters in
   Native IP multi-domain scenario and defines some new inter-AS TE
   related TLVs for BGP-LS to let SDN controller retrieve the network
   topology automatically under various environments.

   Such process and extension can expand the usage of BGP-LS protocol to
   multi- domain, enable the network operator to collect the connection
   relationship between different AS domains and then calculate the
   overall network topology automatically based on the information
   provided by BGP-LS protocol.

1.  Introduction

   BGP-LS [RFC7752] describes the methodology that using BGP protocol to
   transfer the Link-State information.  Such method can enable SDN
   controller to collect the underlay network topology automatically,
   but normally it can only get the information within one IGP domain.
   If the operator has more than one IGP domain, and these domains
   interconnect with each other, there is no general TLV within current
   BGP- LS to transfer the interconnect information.

   Draft [I-D.ietf-idr-bgpls-segment-routing-epe] defines some
   extensions for exporting BGP peering node topology information
   (including its peers, interfaces and peering ASs) in a way that is
   exploitable in order to compute efficient BGP Peering Engineering
   policies and strategies.  Such information can also be used to
   calculate the interconnection topology among different IGP domains,
   but it requires the border routers to run BGP-LS protocol to collect
   this information and report them to the PCE/SDN controller, which
   restricts the deployment flexibility of BGP-LS protocol.

   This draft analysizes the situations that the PCE/SDN controller
   needs to get about the inter-connected information between different
   AS domains, defines new TLVs to extend the BGP-LS protocol to

   transfer the key information related to the interconnect TE topology.
   After that, the SDN controller can then deduce the multi-domain
   topology automatically based on the information from BGP-LS protocol.

3.  Inter-AS Domain Scenarios.

   Fig.1 illustrates the multi-domain scenarios that this draft
   discussed.  Normally, SDN Controller can get the topology of IGP A
   and IGP B individually via the BGP-LS protocol, but it can't get the
   topology connection information between these two IGP domains because
   there is generally no IGP protocol run on the connected links.

3.1.  IS-IS/OSPF Inter-AS Native IP Scenario

   When the IGP A or IGP B runs native IS-IS/OSPF protocol, the operator
   often redistributes the IPv4/IPv6 prefixes of interconnect links into
   IS-IS/OSPF protocol to ensure the inter-domain connectivity.

   If the IGP runs IS-IS protocol, the redistributed link information
   will be carried in IP External Reachability Information TLV within

Internet-Draft             BGP-LS-Inter-AS-Ext              October 2018


   the Level 2 PDU type that defined in [RFC1195], every router within
   the IGP domain can deduce the redistributed router from the IS-IS
   LSDB.

   If the IGP runs OSPF protocol,[RFC2328]defines the type 5 external
   LSA to transfer the external IPv4 routes;
   [I-D.ietf-ospf-ospfv3-lsa-extend] defines the "External-Prefix TLV"
   to transfer the external IPv6 routes; these LSAs have also the
   advertising router information that initiates the redistribute
   activity.  Every router within IGP domain can also deduce the
   redistributed router from the OSPF LSDB.

   For prefix information that associated with each router, BGP-LS
   [RFC7752] defines the Prefix NLRI which is illustrated below:

        0                   1                   2                   3

       |                            (64 bits)                          |

              Figure 2: The IPv4/IPv6 Topology Prefix NLRI Format

   For these redistributed inter-domain links, their prefix information
   should be included in the "Prefix Descriptor", and the associated
   redistributed router information should be included in the "Local
   Node Descriptors".

   When such information is reported via the BGP-LS protocol, the PCE/
   SDN controller can construct the underlay inter-domain topology
   according to procedure described in section 5

3.2.  IS-IS/OSPF Inter-AS TE Scenario

   [RFC5316] and [RFC5392] define the IS-IS and OSPF extensions
   respectively to deal with the requirements for inter-AS traffic
   engineering.  They define some new sub-TLVs(Remote AS
   Number&#12289;IPv4 Remote ASBR ID&#12289;IPv6 Remote ASBR ID) which
   are associated with the inter-AS TE link TLVs to report the TE
   topology between different domains.

   These TLVs are flooded within the IGP domain automatically.  If the
   PCE/SDN controller can know these information via one of the interior
   router that runs BGP-LS protocol, the PCE/SDN controller can rebuild
   the inter-AS TE topology correctly.

4.  Inter-AS TE related TLVs

   This draft proposes to add three new TLVs that is included within the
   inter-AS TE link NLRI to transfer the information via BGP-LS, which
   are required to build the inter-AS related topology by the PCE/SDN
   controller.

   The following Link Descriptor TLVs are added into the Link NLRI in
   BGP-LS protocol :

   +-----------+---------------------+--------------+----------------+
   |  TLV Code | Description         |IS-IS/OSPF TLV| Reference      |
   |   Point   |                     |   /Sub-TLV   | (RFC/Section)  |
   +-----------+---------------------+--------------+----------------+
   |    TBD    |Remote AS Number     |   24/21      | [RFC5316]/3.3.1|
   |           |                     |              | [RFC5392]/3.3.1|
   |    TBD    |IPv4 Remote ASBR ID  |   25/22      | [RFC5316]/3.3.2|
   |           |                     |              | [RFC5392]/3.3.2|
   |    TBD    |IPv6 Remote ASBR ID  |   26/24      | [RFC5316]/3.3.3|
   |           |                     |              | [RFC5392]/3.3.3|
   +-----------+---------------------+--------------+----------------+

   Detail encoding of these TLVs are synchronized with the corresponding
   parts in [RFC5316] and [RFC5392], which keeps the BGP-LS protocol is
   agnostic to the underly protocol.

4.1.  Remote AS Number TLV

   A new TLV, the remote AS number TLV, is defined for inclusion in the
   link descriptor when advertising inter-AS links.  The remote AS
   number TLV specifies the AS number of the neighboring AS to which the
   advertised link connects.

   The remote AS number TLV is TLV type TBD (see Section 7) and is 4
   octets in length.  The format is as follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                       Remote AS Number                        |

   The Remote AS number field has 4 octets.  When only 2 octets are used
   for the AS number, as in current deployments, the left (high-order) 2
   octets MUST be set to 0.  The remote AS number TLV MUST be included
   when a router advertises an inter-AS TE link.

4.2.  IPv4 Remote ASBR ID

   A new TLV, which is referred to as the IPv4 remote ASBR ID TLV, is
   defined for inclusion in the link descriptor when advertising inter-
   AS links.  The IPv4 remote ASBR ID TLV specifies the IPv4 identifier
   of the remote ASBR to which the advertised inter-AS link connects.
   This could be any stable and routable IPv4 address of the remote
   ASBR.  Use of the TE Router ID as specified in the Traffic
   Engineering router ID TLV [RFC5305] is RECOMMENDED.

   The IPv4 remote ASBR ID TLV is TLV type TBD (see Section 7) and is 4
   octets in length.  The format of the IPv4 remote ASBR ID sub-TLV is
   as follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The IPv4 remote ASBR ID TLV MUST be included if the neighboring ASBR
   has an IPv4 address.  If the neighboring ASBR does not have an IPv4
   address (not even an IPv4 TE Router ID), the IPv6 remote ASBR ID TLV
   MUST be included instead.  An IPv4 remote ASBR ID TLV and IPv6 remote
   ASBR ID TLV MAY both be present in an inter-AS TE link NLRI.

4.3.  IPv6 Remote ASBR ID

   A new TLV, which is referred to as the IPv6 remote ASBR ID TLV, is
   defined for inclusion in the inter-AS reachability TLV when
   advertising inter-AS links.  The IPv6 remote ASBR ID TLV specifies
   the IPv6 identifier of the remote ASBR to which the advertised inter-
   AS link connects.  This could be any stable and routable IPv6 address
   of the remote ASBR.  Use of the TE Router ID as specified in the IPv6
   Traffic Engineering router ID TLV [RFC6119] is RECOMMENDED.

   The IPv6 remote ASBR ID TLV is TLV type TBD (see Section 7) and is 16
   octets in length.  The format of the IPv6 remote ASBR ID TLV is as
   follows:

   The IPv6 remote ASBR ID TLV MUST be included if the neighboring ASBR
   has an IPv6 address.  If the neighboring ASBR does not have an IPv6
   address, the IPv4 remote ASBR ID TLV MUST be included instead.  An
   IPv4 remote ASBR ID TLV and IPv6 remote ASBR ID TLV MAY both be
   present in an inter-AS TE link NLRI.

5.  Topology Reconstruction.

   When SDN Controller gets such information from BGP-LS protocol, it
   should compares the proximity of the redistributed prefixes.  If they
   are under the same network scope, then it should find the
   corresponding associated router information, build the link between
   these two border routers.

   After iterating the above procedures for all of the redistributed
   prefixes, the SDN controller can then retrieve the connection
   topology between different domains automatically.

6.  Security Considerations

   It is common for one operator to occupy several IGP domains that
   composited by its backbone network and several MAN(Metrio-Area-
   Network)s/IDCs.  When they do traffic engineering from end to end
   that spans MAN-backbone-IDC, they need to know the inter-as topology
   via the process described in this draft.  Then it is naturally to
   redistribute the interconnection prefixes in Native IP scenario.

   If these IGP domains belong to different operators, it is uncommon do
   inter-as traffic engineering under one PCE/SDN controller, then it is
   unnecessary to get the inter-as topology.  But redistributing the
   interconnection prefixes will do no harm to their networks, because
   the redistributed interconnection link prefixes belongs to both of
   them, they are also the interfaces addresses on the border routers. .
