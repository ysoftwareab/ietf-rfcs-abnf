<a name="rfc.section.1"></a><h3>1.&nbsp;
Introduction</h3>

<p>Many routing protocols such as OSPF and IS-Is use a one-to-many or multicast model of communications. The same message is sent to a number of recipients. 
</p>
<p>These protocols have cryptographic authentication mechanisms
      that use a key shared among all members of a communicating group
      in order to protect messages sent within that group. From a
      security standpoint, all routers in a group are considered
      equal. Protecting against a misbehaving router that is part of
      the group is out of scope for this protocol.
</p>
<p>Routers need to be provisioned with some credentials for a
      one-to-one authentication protocol. Preshared keys or asymmetric
      keys and an authorization list are expected to be common
      deployments. 
</p>
<p>The members of a group elect a Group Controller/Key Server
      (GCKS). Potentially any member of the group may act as a
      GCKS. Since protecting against misbehaving routers is out of
      scope, there is no need to protect against a node that is not
      currently the GCKS impersonating the GCKS.
</p>
<p>To prove membership in the group, a router authenticates
      using its provisioned credentials to the current GCKS. If
      successful, the router is given the current key material for the
      group. Group size is relatively small and need  for
      forced eviction of members is rare. If a GCKS needs to evict a
      member, then it can simply re-authenticate with the existing
      members and provide them new key material.

<a name="rfc.section.1.1"></a><h3>1.1.&nbsp;
Terminology</h3>

<p>One key terminology question to answer is the definition of group. It appears that as used in this document, the term group corresponds to a routing protocol instance on a single link. However, this needs to be confirmed with TE routing protocols and with PIM. If that works out then a more precise term than group should be used in this document.

<a name="rfc.section.1.2"></a><h3>1.2.&nbsp;
Relationship to IKEv2</h3>

<p>IKEv2 <a class='info' href='#RFC5996'>[RFC5996]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kaufman, C., Hoffman, P., Nir, Y., and P. Eronen, &ldquo;Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2),&rdquo; September&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>provides a protocol for authenticating IPsec security
	associations between two peers. It currently provides no group
	keying. IKev2 is attractive as a basis for this protocol
	because while it is much simpler than IKE, it provides all the
	needed flexibility in one-to-one authentication.
</p>
<p>Unlike IKE, IKEv2 is explicitly designed for IPsec. The
	document does not separate handling of aspects of the protocol
	that would be needed for IPsec from those that apply to
	general key management. IPsec specific rules are combined
	with more general requirements. While concepts and protocol
	payloads can be used in a different key management protocol,
	the current structure of IKEv2 does not provide a mechanism
	for applying IKEv2 to a domain of interpretation other than
	IPsec. In addition, the complexity required in the IKE
	specification when compared to IKEv2 suggests that the
	generality of IKE may not be worth the complexity cost.
</p>
<p>For these reasons, this protocol borrows concepts and payloads from IKEv2
	but does not normatively depend on the IKEv2 specification.

<a name="rfc.section.1.3"></a><h3>1.3.&nbsp;
Relationship to GDOI</h3>

<p>The IPsec Group Domain of Interpretation (GDOI) <a class='info' href='#RFC3547'>[RFC3547]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Baugher, M., Weis, B., Hardjono, T., and H. Harney, &ldquo;The Group Domain of Interpretation,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a> provides a protocol that is structurally
	very similar to this one. As specified, IKE can be used to
	provide phase 1 authentication to a GCKS. After that, GDOI
	provides phase 2 messages to establish key-encryption keys and
	traffic keys. Key management operations can be accomplished
	via GDOI messages sent to the group after the phase 2 exchange.
</p>
<p>GDOI is defined for IKE not for IKEv2. In addition, GDOI's
	phase 2 uses its own hashing mechanism and nonce mechanism to
	provide integrity protection and replay protection. Like IKE,
	GDOI has significant complexity to support phase 2 identities
	that are different than the phase 1 identity. GDOI requires a
	GCKS to have a signature key used to sign GDOI messages when the rekey protocol is used. Since
	attacks caused by members of the group masquerading as the
	GCKS are out of scope, this is significant unnecessary
	complexity in the protocol.
</p>
<p> This protocol can be thought of as a simplified GDOI
	based on IKEv2 rather than IKE. However, integrity and replay
	mechanisms are taken from IKEv2. Support for phase 2
	identities is removed as unneeded complexity. Security for the
	group key management messages is provided using symmetric
	primitives rather than asymmetric signatures. Phase 1
	authentication will often still involve asymmetric
	signatures.

Overview</h3>

<p>MRKMP is composed of several parts. There is an initial exchange used to establish a shared key with a GCKS and authenticate the identities of both parties. Unicast key management exchanges provide the ability to join a group or request updates to the group; group joins can also be combined with the initial exchange. There is an election protocol used by routers to determine which router will act as the GCKS; this protocol is not integrity protected, but a GCKS confirms its role when a member uses the unicast exchange to join the group. Finally, a GCKS uses multicast exchanges to update parameters of the group. This section briefly describes each of these parts of MRKMP. The later sections in the document describe the details of the protocols.

<a name="rfc.section.2.1"></a><h3>2.1.&nbsp;
Types of Keys</h3>

<p>MRKMP manipulates several different types of symmetric
	keys:
</p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>preshared:</dt>
<dd>Preshared keys are one mechanism
	    for authenticating one router to another during the initial exchange. These keys are configured by some mechanism
	    such as manual configuration or a management application
	    outside of the scope of MRKMP. A single preshared key can be used for all members of a group. Alternatively each pair of routers can have a different preshared key.<br />
<br />

</dd>
<dt>peer key management key:</dt>
<dd>Routers share a key
	    with the GCKS that is a result of the mrkmp_init exchange.
</dd>
<dt>KEK:</dt>
<dd>A Key encryption Key (KEK) is a key
	    used to encrypt group key management messages to the
	    current members of a group. A KEK is learned as the
	    product of establishing an MRKMP association  or through a
	    group key management message encrypted in a previous
	    KEK. A KEK has an explicit expiration but may also be
	    retired by a message encrypted in the KEK sent by the
	    GCKS.<br />
<br />

</dd>
<dt>protocol master key:</dt>
<dd>A protocol master key
	    is the key exported by MRKMP for use by a routing protocol
	    such as OSPF or IS-IS. The Protocol master key is the key
	    that would be manually configured if a routing protocol is
	    used without key management.<br />
<br />

</dd>
<dt>transport key:</dt>
<dd>The transport key is the key
	    used to integrity protect routing messages in a protocol
	    such as IS-IS or OSPF. In today's routing protocol
	    cryptographic authentication mechanisms the transport key
	    is the same as the protocol master key. A disadvantage of
	    this approach is that replay prevention is challenging
	    with this architecture. Ideally some key derivation step
	    would be used to establish a fresh transport key among all
	    the participants in the group.
</dd>

<a name="rfc.section.2.1.1"></a><h3>2.1.1.&nbsp;
Key Encryption Key</h3>

<p>When a router wishes to join a group, the router
	  performs the mrkmp_init and mrkmp_auth exchange  with a GCKS. During this process the
	  router can establish an  association with a specific
	  group. Part of that association will be delivery of a KEK
	  and associated parameters.
</p>
<p>Group key management messages are sent to a group address
	  not unicast to an individual peer. The group key management
	  messages are protected using the KEK. The group key
	  management messages need to provide both integrity and
	  confidentiality protection using the KEK.
</p>
<p>As part of establishing the association, the router
	  joining the group is given an expiration time for the KEK. A
	  group key management message may establish a new KEK with
	  new parameters.
</p>
<p>From time to time, a GCKS may wish to either force early
	  expiration of a KEK or allow a KEK to expire. Protocol
	  master keys are permitted to be valid for somewhat longer
	  than the KEK that created them so as to avoid disrupting
	  routing when this happens. When a KEK is retired or expires without being replaced by a new KEK announced in the old KEK, group members
	  need to perform a new initial exchange to the
	  GCKS. This is useful for example if a router is no longer
	  authorized to be part of the group.

<p>Other mechanisms such as LKH (section 5.4 <a class='info' href='#RFC2627'>[RFC2627]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Wallner, D., Harder, E., and R. Agee, &ldquo;Key Management for Multicast: Issues and Architectures,&rdquo; June&nbsp;1999.</span><span>)</span></a>) could be used to

Protocol Keys</h3>

<p>Current routing protocols directly use the protocol
	  master key to integrity protect messages. One advantage for
	  this approach is that the initial hello messages used for
	  discovery and capability exchange can be protected using the
	  same mechanism as other messages. Typically a sequence
	  number is used for replay detection. Without changing the
	  key, the existing protocols are vulnerable to a number of
	  serious denial of service attacks from replays.
</p>
<p> The MRKMP can solve this replay problem by changing the
	  protocol master  key whenever a peer is about to exhaust its
	  sequence number space or whenever a peer loses information
	  about what sequence numbers it used. This could potentially
	  involve changing the protocol master key whenever a router
	  reboots that was part of the group using the current
	  protocol master key. Since key changes will not disrupt
	  active adjacencies and can be accomplished relatively
	  quickly, this is not expected to be a huge problem. Note
	  that after one key change, others routers can boot without
	  causing additional key changes; a flurry of key changes
	  would not be required if several routers reboot near each
	  other.
</p>
<p>Another approach would be to separate the protocol master
	  key from the transport keys. For example the transport key
	  used by a given peer could be a fresh key derived from the
	  protocol master key and nonces announced by that peer. Some
	  mechanism would need to make sure that the peer's
	  announcement of its nonce was fresh; this mechanism would
	  almost certainly involve some form of interaction with the
	  router wishing to guarantee freshness. There are two key
	  advantages of this separation between transport keys and
	  protocol master keys. The first is that the interaction
	  between the MRKMP and routing protocol can be simplified
	  significantly. The second is that even when manually
	  configured protocol master keys are used, replay and
	  adequate DOS protection can be achieved.

GCKS Election</h3>

<p>Before a MRKMP system actually starts working, the routers in the
multicast group need to select a GCKS so that they can obtain
cryptographic keys to secure subsequent exchanges of routing
information. MRKMP specifies an election protocol that dynamically
assigns the responsibility of key management to one of the group
members.  Note that there are already announcer-electing mechanisms
provided in some routing protocols (e.g., OSPF and IS-IS). However, much
involvement between a MRKMP system and a routing protocol
implementation will be introduced if the MRKMP system reuses the
announcer-electing mechanism for the election of the GCKS. The state
machine of the routing protocol also has to be modified. For instance,
in OSPF, after a DR has been elected, routers need to halt their OSPF
executions, and carry out the initial exchange to authenticate the DR
and collect the keys for subsequent communications. After this step,
the routers need to re-start their OSPF state machines so as to
exchange routing information. As a consequence of such cases, an
individual GCKS electing solution within MRKMP is preferable.  

</p>
<p>Each router has a GCKS priority. Higher priorities are more preferred GCKSes. As discussed in <a class='info' href='#ROUTER-INTERFACE'>Section&nbsp;8<span> (</span><span class='info'>Interface to Routing Protocol</span><span>)</span></a>, the routing protocol can influence the GCKS election protocol by manipulating the priority so that it is likely that the same router will be the announcer for the routing protocol and the GCKS. Even if two different routers are elected as the announcer and GCKS, then the routing protocol and MRKMP will function correctly.

Initial Exchange</h3>

<p>The initial  exchange is based on IKEv2's IKE_SA_INIT and
	IKE_SA_AUTH exchanges. 
 During this exchange, an initiating router attempts
	to authenticate to the router it believes is a GCKS for a
	group that the initiating router wants to join. Messages are
	unicast from the initiator to the responding GCKS. Unicast
	MRKMP P messages form a request/response protocol; the party
	sending the messages is responsible for retransmissions.
</p>
<p>The initial exchange provides capability negotiation,
	specifically including supported cryptographic suites for the
	key management protocol. Identification of the initiator and
	responder is also exchanged. A symmetric key is established to
	integrity protect and encrypt key management messages. While
	routing security does not typically require confidentiality,
	the key management protocol does because keys are exchanged
	and these must be protected.
</p>
<p>Then the identities of each party are cryptographically
	verified. This can be done using a preshared key or symmetric
	keys. Other mechanisms may be added as a future extension.
</p>
<p>The authentication exchange also provides an opportunity to
	join a group as part of the initial exchange. In the typical
	case, a router can obtain the needed key material for a group
	in two round-trips.

Group Join Exchange</h3>

<p>The primary purpose of the unicast MRKMP messages is to get
	an initiator the information it needs to join a group and
	participate in a routing protocol. The initiator indicates
	what group it wants to join. XXX we need to discuss group
	naming--if MRKMP is limited to a subnet this may be as simple
	as saying that initiator wants to join the OSPF group or the
	IS-IS group.
</p>
<p>The responder performs several checks. First, the responder
	confirms that the responder is currently acting as GCKS for
	the group in question. Then, the responder confirms that the
	initiator is permitted to join the group. If these checks
	pass, then the responder provides a key download payload to the
	initiator encrypted in the peer key management key. As discussed in
	<a class='info' href='#PROTOCOL_KEYS'>Section&nbsp;2.1.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Protocol Keys</span><span>)</span></a>, the GCKS MUST change the
	protocol master key if a router was part of the group under
	the current protocol master key and reboots. In this case, the
	GCKS SHOULD provide the new and old protocol master key to the
	initiator, setting the validity times for the old key to
	permit reception but not transmission. The GCKS MUST use the
	mechanism in the next section to flood the new key to the rest
	of the group.
</p>
<p>A group association created by this exchange may last
	beyond the unicast MRKMP association used to create it. Once
	membership in a group is established, resources are not
	required to maintain the unicast association with the
	GCKS.
</p>
<p>A member of a group can also use the unicast exchange to
	request a GCKS to change the protocol master key because that
	group has exhausted its available sequence space. For protocols
	where the protocol master key is the same as the transport key,
	it is critical that no two messages be sent by the same router
	with the same sequence number and protocol master key. The
	sequence number space is finite. So if a router is running low
	on available sequence space it needs to request a new protocol
	master key be generated.

Group Key Management</h3>

<p>The GCKS shares a KEK with all members of a group. The GCKS
	can send a multicast message to the group to update the set of
	protocol master keys, update the KEK, or retire the KEK and
	request new group join exchanges.
</p>
<p>Typically the protocol master key is changed only when
	needed to provide replay protection or when the KEK
	changes. The KEK changes whenever a new GCKS is elected or
	whenever it is administratively desirable to change the
	keys. For example if an employee leaves an organization it
	might be desirable to change the KEKs. A KEK is retired
	whenever forward security is desired: whenever the
	authorization of who is permitted to be in a group changes and
	the GCKS needs to make sure that the router is no longer
	participating. Most authorization changes such as removing a
	router from service do not require forward security in
	practical deployments.

<a name="rfc.section.3"></a><h3>3.&nbsp;
GCKS Election</h3>

<p>The GCKS election process selects a single router on a link to act as GCKS for a group.Similar with
other popular announcer electing mechanisms (e.g., VRRP, HSRP), in
MRKMP, only GCKSes use multicast to periodically send Advertisement
messages. Such advertisements can be used as heart beat packets to
indicate the aliveness of GCKSes. In addition, a state machine with
three states (Initial, GCKS, and Member) is specified for GCKS
election. When a router is initially connected to a multicast
network, its state is set as Initial. The router then sends a
multicast initial advertisement, if a GCKS is working on the network,
it will reply the router with an advertisement using unicast. After
receiving the advertisement from the GCKS, the router will try to
register with the GCKS using the initial exchange, and then the state of
the router is transferred to Member. Note that when the router
receives the advertisement it does not have the traffic distributed in
the group. Thus, the integrity of the unicast advertisement does not
have to be protected. After a certain period, if the router still does
not receive any advertisement from a GCKS or other group members, the
router then believe there is no other group member on the network and
set its state as GCKS. If during the period the router does not
receive any advertisement from a GCKS but receives advertisements from
other routers on the network, router believes that the group is
involved in a GCKS election process.  Apart from the initialization of
a multicast network, the fail-over of a GCKS can also trigger an
election process. For instance, if a router does not receive the heart
beat advertisement for a certain period, it will transfer its state to
Initial and try to elect a new one. In a GCKS electing process, a
router has to stay in the Initial state until a new GCKS is
allocated. Particularly, the router first sends its initial
advertisement with its priority and waits for a certain period. During
the period, if a router receives an initial advertisement which
consists of a lower priority, the router then sends the advertisement
again with a limited rate. After period, if the router does not find
any router with a higher priority, it announces itself as the
GCKS. If two routers have the same priority, the one with the lowest IP source address used for messages on the link will be the GCKS. After a router transfer its state to GCKS, it will reply to  the
initial advertisements from other routers with GCKS advertisements,
even when the initial advertisements consist of properties priorities than
its priority. This approach guarantees that a GCKS will not be changed
frequently after it has been elected. After receiving the GCKS
advertisement of the new elected GCKS, other routers transfer their
states to Member. However, if a GCKS G1 receives a GCKS
advertisement from another router G2 and G2 is a more preferred GCKS, G1 follows the procedure in <a class='info' href='#MERGE-PROCEDURE'>Section&nbsp;3.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Merging Partitioned Networks</span><span>)</span></a>.

</p>
<p>If a node in state member fails to perform an initial exchange with the router it believes to be GCKS, it resets its state to initial but ignores advertisements from that router. This way an attacker cannot disrupt communications indefinitely by masquerading as a GCKS.
</p>
<p>If a node transitions to GCKS state, it performs the procedure in <a class='info' href='#NEW-GCKS'>Section&nbsp;3.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>A new GCKS is Elected</span><span>)</span></a>.

Merging Partitioned Networks</h3>

<p>Whenever a GCKS finds that a more preferred router is also
	acting as a GCKS for the same group, then the group is
	partitioned. Typically if there is already an active GCKS for
	a group, even if a more preferred GCKS joins, the GCKS will
	not change. Two situations can result in multiple GCKSes
	active for a group. The first is that members of the group do
	not share common authentication credentials. The second is
	that the group was previously partitioned so that some nodes
	could not see election messages from other nodes. After the
	problem resulting in the partition is fixed, then both active
	GCKSes will see each others election announcements. The group
	needs to merge.
</p>
<p>The less preferred GCKS performs a unicast mrkmp_merge_sa
	unicast key management message to the more preferred GCKS. In
	this message the less preferred GCKS includes its key download
	payload, so the more preferred GCKS learns the protocol master
	keys of the less preferred GCKS. 
</p>
<p>The more preferred GCKS generates a new key download
	payload including a KEK and the union of all the protocol
	master keys. The GCKS SHOULD mark  the existing protocol master keys
 as expiring for usage in
	transmitted packets in a relatively short time. The GCKS
	SHOULD introduce a new protocol master key. This key download
	payload is returned to the less preferred GCKS and is sent out
	in the current KEK using a group key management message.
</p>
<p>The less preferred GCKS sends the received key download
	payload encrypted in its existing KEK. XXX how many retransmits. After all retransmissions
	of this payload the less preferred GCKS sets its state to
	member.
</p>
<p>As a result of this procedure, members learn the protocol
	master keys of both GCKSes and converge on a single KEK and
	GCKS. Changing the protocol master keys during a merge is
	important for protocols that use the protocol master key as a
	transport key. The new GCKS does not know which routers have
	joined the group with the other GCKS. Therefore, it could not
	correctly detect one of these routers rebooting and change the
	protocol master key at that point. If the key is changed as
	part of the merge, replays are handled.

Priority Adjustment</h3>

<p>It is desirable that the GCKS function track the functions

	for that link, it would be desirable for the GCKS role to be
	assigned to that router. The routing protocol provides a
	priority input to the GCKS election process. Initially the
	routing protocol should map any priority mechanism within the
	routing protocol to the GCKS election procedure so that
	routers favored as announcer for a link will also be favored
	as a GCKS.
</p>
<p>However, the routing protocol SHOULD also dynamically
	manipulate the GCKS election priority based on what happens
	within the routing protocol. The router actually elected as
	the announcer SHOULD have a GCKS election priority higher than
	any other group member. Typically, by the time the routing
	protocol is able to elect an announcer, a GCKS will already be
	chosen. However, if a GCKS election is triggered when the
	routing protocol is already operational, then the election can
	choose the routing protocol's announcer.

Security Considerations</h3>

<p>An attacker who can suppress packets sent to the group can
      create a denial of service condition. One attack is to suppress
      GCKS election packets and cause two routers to believe they are
      both the GCKS for the group. If the least preferred router never
      hears the GCKS advertisement from the more preferred router,
      then the group will remain partitioned. Such an attacker is
      likely to be able to mount more direct denial of service, for
      example suppressing the actual routing protocol packets.
</p>
<p>The security of the system as a whole depends on the
      pair-wise security between the router currently in the GCKS role
      and the other routers in the group. Since any router can
      potentially act as GCKS, the pair-wise security between all
      members of the group is critical to the security of the
      system. In practical deployments, information used by the router
      acting as GCKS to authorize a member joining the group will be
      configured by some management application. In these deployments,
      the security of the system depends on the management application
      correctly maintaining this information on all routers
      potentially in the group.
