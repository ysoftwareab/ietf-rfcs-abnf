1.  Introduction

   The overall goal of Data Security Maturity Model (DSMM) is to provide
   a multi-level maturity model to help organizations solving the
   problems of data security management in big data era, including:

   o  How to build organizations data security capability

   o  How to measure the data security capability maturity level of an
      organization

   o  How to identify issues about data security capability

   o  How to improve data security capability for organizations

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Overview

   The DSMM is a process management and improvement maturity model for
   the development and management of data security services.  It
   consists of best practices that address the security issues in the
   lifecycle of data management from creation to delivery and
   maintenance.  The practices related to the DSMM model are extensible
   and applicable to any organization objectives.  The model presents an
   organized set of practices and goals necessary for the data security.

   The DSMM defines the requirements for organization responsibilities,
   institution processes, technology tools, and staff skills, to ensure
   data security management in the organizations.  It does not describe
   how organizations must do something, but rather what they must do in
   order to achieve high capabilities or maturity of data security
   management.  By providing a structured and standard framework of
   practices, the DSMM can be used by organizations to build their own
   roadmap of data security maturity management.  The DSMM has an
   accompanying standardized methodology for conducting objective
   appraisals of capability and maturity levels within the organizations
   data security management practice.

   The DSMM applies to all kinds of organizations, including industry
   enterprises, governments and research institutes.

5.  Data Lifecycle

   The high-level descriptions for data lifecycle are:

   o  1) Data Creation: Data creation is the generation of new digital
      content, or the significant alteration/updating of existing
      content, either structured or unstructured.

   o  2) Data Usage: Data usage refers to the combination of a series of
      activities towards active data.

   o  3) Data Transmission: Data transition refers to the process that
      data flows from one entity to another through the network.

   o  4) Data Storage: Data storage refers to inactive data, which is
      stored physically in any digital form.

   o  5) Data Sharing: Data sharing refers to data exchanging between
      organizations, customers and partners.

   o  6) Data Destruction: Data destruction refers to the process of
      permanently or temperately making the data unavailable using
      physical or digital means (e.g., crypto-shredding, freezing data
      under business context).


6.  Capability Dimension

   The DSMM model defines the organization capability in four
   dimensions, namely:

   o  1) Organization Responsibilities: The first and most important
      capability the organization should build is its data security
      organization, including its function and responsibility, security
      consciousness.  It addresses the need to drive organizational data
      security management from the top down effort, and in this way,
      organizations can be open and transparent, break down silos and
      get internal teams to collaborate.  It is important to get
      executive support, to champion data security adoption from the top
      down.

   o  2)Institution Process: This capability involves the creation of
      process.  This means that organizations need to put processes and
      frameworks in place to operationalize data security management
      internally and externally.  It enables tight collaboration between
      different teams and entities like legal teams, IT, Crisis PR,
      various business units and external business parties.

   o  3)Technology Tools: Organizations have to invest in security
      technology to facilitate the data security controls it employed,
      especially under current big data era.  Manual controls or
      management controls have been verified inefficient.  One of the

      challenges within this capability is that there are various
      technologies available to choose thus organizations need to think
      strategically with proper assessment before investing.  Ensuring
      that the technology can scale and integrate with existing
      applications that already exist in the enterprise is imperative.

   o  4)Staff Skills: Organizations have to educate their staffs, to get
      more security awareness training, and improve their security
      skills.


7.  Assessment Method

   The DSMM model uses bottom-up method to assess and determine the data
   security maturity level of an organization.  Each domain in one data
   lifecycle phase should be assessed and be given a single maturity
   level as the assessment result of the domain.  Then, take the minimum
   level of these domains as the assessment result of the data lifecycle
   phase.  Finally, the minimum maturity level of all 6 data lifecycle
   phases is the overall maturity of the organization.
