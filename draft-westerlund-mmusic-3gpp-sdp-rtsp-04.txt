2.  Introduction

   3GPP has specified the Packet-switched Streaming Service (PSS) that
   uses both RTSP [RFC2326] and SDP [RFC4566]. The service is specified
   in technical specifications TS 26.233 [PSS-233] and TS 26.234 [PSS-
   234] in Release 4 and later releases. The basic service defined in
   Release 4 is enhanced in Release 5 with capability exchange and in
   Release 6 with a number of features, such as adaptation, digital
   rights management, progressive download as well as a streaming
   server file-format defined in [PSS-3GP].

   3GPP has also specified the Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service
   (MBMS) that uses SDP. The IP layer protocols used by this service
   are specified in technical specification TS 26.346 Release 6 [MBMS].

   In the process of defining these services, there has occasionally
   been the need to extend both SDP and RTSP functionality. These
   extensions have mostly been in the form of SDP attributes and RTSP
   headers. The purpose of this informational document is to register
   these SDP and RTSP extensions, in order to avoid future conflicts,
   and also to raise the awareness of their existence within IETF.

   The document begins with two chapters presenting the different
   extensions of SDP for PSS and MBMS, respectively, followed by a
   section noting that offer/answer considerations are not applicable
   here. The subsequent section presents the extensions of RTSP for
   PSS. The IANA registration of SDP attributes and protocol
   identifiers is given in section 7.1, and the RTSP headers in section
   7.2. For normative descriptions of all SDP and RTSP extensions we
   refer to TS 26.234 [PSS-234] and TS 26.346 [MBMS].

3.  PSS SDP Extensions

   The PSS specification [PSS-234] defines a number of different SDP
   attributes for different purposes. They are informatively listed
   below grouped by purpose.

3.1. Video Buffering attributes

   The following attributes are used to provide parameters for the
   video buffer model provided in Annex G and Section 5.3.3.2 of [PSS-
   234]. The attributes were defined in Release 5 as "X-" attributes
   and were at the time not considered for registration. In hindsight,
   however, they should not have been "X-" attributes, and they should
   have been registered, as the registration rules of SDP [RFC4566]
   point out. Changing their names today is impossible due to the
   deployed base of millions of mobile handsets supporting PSS, and
   therefore they are registered in their current form.

   All attributes are defined at media level.

   - The "a=X-predecbufsize" attribute provides the size of the pre-
      decoder buffer.
   - The "a=X-initpredecbufperiod" attribute provides the time during
      which a receiver should initially buffer before starting to
      consume the data in the buffer in order to ensure that underflow
      does not occur, assuming correct data delivery.
   - The "a=X-initpostdecbufperiod" attribute provides the initial
      buffering period for the post-decoder buffer present in H.263 and
      MPEG-4 Visual.
   - The "a=X-decbyterate" attribute indicates the maximum peak byte-
      decoding rate used in the verification of the Annex G buffer
      model.
   - The "a=3gpp-videopostdecbufsize" attribute is used to indicate
      the size of the H.264 video post-decoder buffer.

   Note that complete descriptions of these attributes can be found in
   section 5.3.3.2 of [PSS-234].

3.2. Video Frame Size attribute

   This media-level attribute provides the receiver with the largest
   picture size a specific H.263 payload type will carry within the
   session. The attribute has the following form (see 5.3.3.2 of [PSS-
   234]):

   "a=framesize:<payload type number> <width>-<height>"

INTERNET-DRAFT SDP & RTSP extensions for 3GPP PSS & MBMS  Oct 17, 2006


3.3. Integrity Protection Configuration Attributes

   These attributes are all used to configure the integrity-protection
   mechanism defined in Annex K (section K.2.2.1, K.2.2.2 and K.2.2.3)
   of [PSS-234].

   - The session-level attribute "a=3GPP-Integrity-Key" carries the
      integrity key used to derive SRTP master keys for integrity
      protection. They key is protected in different ways depending on
      a method identifier.
   - The media-level attribute "a=3GPP-SRTP-Config" is used to
      configure SRTP for integrity protection and contains an integrity
      nonce, a key salt used in deriving the SRTP master key from the
      integrity key, and any SRTP configuration parameters, such as the
      integrity tag length.
   - The session-level attribute "a=3GPP-SDP-Auth" is used to carry an
      authentication tag calculated over certain parts of the SDP to
      prevent manipulation of the security attributes.

3.4. The Alternative Attributes

   Two media and one session-level attributes are used in a mechanism
   for providing alternative SDP lines. One or more SDP lines at media
   level can be replaced, if desired, by alternatives. The mechanism is
   backwards compatible in the way that a receiver that does not
   support the attributes will get the default configuration. The
   different alternatives can be grouped using different attributes
   that can be specified hierarchically with a top and a lower level.
   3GPP Release 6 supports grouping based on bit-rate, according to the
   SDP bandwidth modifiers AS and TIAS, and language.

   The SDP attributes (see 5.3.3.3 and 5.3.3.4 of [PSS-234]) are:
   - The media-level attribute "a=alt:<id>:<SDP-Line>" carries any SDP
      line and an alternative identifier.
   - The media-level attribute "a=alt-default-id:<id>" identifies the
      default configuration to be used in groupings.
   - The session-level attribute "a=alt-group" is used to group
      different recommended media alternatives.

3.5. Adaptation Attribute

   The media-level SDP attribute "a=3GPP-Adaptation-Support" (see
   5.3.3.5 of [PSS-234]) is defined as part of the negotiation
   procedure of the PSS adaptation mechanism. The adaptation mechanism
   allows the client to provide the server with information on the
   available transmission bit-rate and receiver buffer status.

INTERNET-DRAFT SDP & RTSP extensions for 3GPP PSS & MBMS  Oct 17, 2006


3.6. Quality of Experience Attribute

   The session and media-level attribute "a=3GPP-QoE-Metrics" (see
   5.3.3.6 of [PSS-234]) is used to negotiate the usage of the quality
   of experience metrics. The included parameters indicate metrics and
   parameters that are desirable to use.

3.7. Asset Information Attribute

   The session and media-level attribute "a=3GPP-Asset-Information"
   (see 5.3.3.7 of [PSS-234]) can exist in multiple instances in a
   description and describes different types of asset information. The
   different asset classes defined in Release 6 are: Title,
   Description, Copyright, Performer, Author, Genre, Rating,
   Classification, Keywords, Location, Album, and Recording Year. The
   different assets are described with a BASE64-encoded asset box from
   the 3GP file format [PSS-3GP].


4.  MBMS SDP Extensions

   The MBMS specification [MBMS] defines a number of different SDP
   attributes for different purposes. They are informatively listed
   below.

4.1. MBMS Bearer Mode Declaration Attribute

   The session and media-level attribute "a=mbms-mode" (see 7.3.2.7 of
   [MBMS]) is used to describe MBMS broadcast mode media. The attribute
   may be used at session level to set the default for all media and at
   media level to specify differences between media. However, the
   attribute is never used at session level when the session includes
   MBMS multicast mode media, nor at media level to describe MBMS
   multicast mode media.

4.2. FEC Flow ID Attribute

   The media-level attribute "a=mbms-flowid" (see 8.3.1.9 of [MBMS])
   maps one or more FEC source block flow IDs to their corresponding
   destination IP addresses and UDP port numbers. It is present in each
   SDP media block for repair packet streams.

4.3. MBMS Repair Attribute

   The session and media-level attribute "a=mbms-repair" (see 8.3.1.8
   of [MBMS]) is used to provide FEC repair packets with non-FEC
   specific parameters. For Release 6 one such parameter is defined,
   specifying the required minimum receiver buffer time.

INTERNET-DRAFT SDP & RTSP extensions for 3GPP PSS & MBMS  Oct 17, 2006


4.4. SDP Protocol Identifiers for FEC

   MBMS defines a mechanism to provide block-based FEC for UDP-based
   traffic.  This solution uses the SDP protocol "proto" identifier to
   identify the media streams that use the FEC shim layer. The media
   streams may be both source streams and repair streams.

   For FEC-protected RTP streams the following two "proto" identifiers
   are defined:

   - UDP/MBMS-FEC/RTP/AVP
   - UDP/MBMS-FEC/RTP/SAVP

   Both are defined in Section C.1 of 3GPP TS 26.346 [MBMS]. They
   indicate the usage of UDP with MBMS FEC Source packet formats that
   transport RTP packets in accordance with the AVP or SAVP (Secure
   RTP) profiles, respectively.

   Section C.2 of TS 26.346 [MBMS] defines an SDP "proto" identifier
   "UDP/MBMS-REPAIR" for indication of a media stream of MBMS FEC
   repair packets. MBMS FEC repair packets are repair symbols with the
   necessary framing sent as UDP packets.


5.  SDP Offer/Answer Consideration

   The usage of the SDP attributes in an Offer/Answer [RFC3264] context
   is not defined. These SDP attributes are defined for being used in a
   declarative context, and for PSS specifically in RTSP [RFC2326].


6.  PSS RTSP Extensions

   The RTSP extensions for PSS consist of a number of new RTSP headers
   and a narrowing of URI usage in regards to 3GP files. The headers
   are informatively described here; see [PSS-234] for the normative
   declaration.

6.1. 3GPP-Link-Char Header

   The 3GPP-Link-Char header (see 5.3.2.1 of [PSS-234]) is used by
   clients to provide the server with QoS information about the
   wireless link it is currently using. The header can be used to
   provide the server with three different QoS parameters:
   - Guaranteed Bandwidth
   - Maximum Bandwidth
   - Maximum Transfer Delay

   The header may be included in RTSP requests using either of the
   methods SETUP, PLAY, OPTIONS and SET_PARAMETER.

INTERNET-DRAFT SDP & RTSP extensions for 3GPP PSS & MBMS  Oct 17, 2006



6.2. 3GPP-Adaptation Header

   The 3GPP-Adaptation header (see 5.3.2.2 of [PSS-234]) is used by the
   client to provide the server with adaptation-related parameters and
   to indicate support of the adaptation function. The header carries
   the resource identification as a URI, the client's buffer size, and
   the desired target time.

   The header may be included in requests using the methods SETUP,
   PLAY, OPTIONS and SET_PARAMETER. The response to a request using
   this method shall include this header.


6.3. 3GPP-QoE-Metrics Header

   The 3GPP-QoE-Metrics header (see 5.3.2.3.1 of [PSS-234]) is used to
   negotiate the usage of the quality of experience (QoE) metrics (see
   Section 11 of [PSS-234]).

   The header may be included in requests and responses using the
   SETUP, SET_PARAMTER, OPTIONS or PLAY method.

6.4. 3GPP-QoE-Feedback Header

   The 3GPP-QoE-Feedback header (see 5.3.2.3.2 of [PSS-234]) is used to
   carry QoE metrics from the client to the server when it reports,
   which happen either during or at the end of the media delivery.

   The header may be included in requests using the SET_PARAMETER,
   PAUSE, or TEARDOWN method.

6.5. Video buffer Headers

   PSS uses several headers to provide the client with the different
   buffer parameters. They provide the buffer status at the point of a
   stream that a PLAY request plays from. These headers may only be
   used in PLAY responses. See Section 5.3.2.4 and Annex G of [PSS-234]
   for normative definitions.

   The three "x-" headers were defined in 3GPP Release 5. When it was
   realized that they should not have been given "x-" names it was too
   late rename them due to deployment.

   The RTSP headers are:
   - x-predecbufsize
   - x-initpredecbufperiod
   - x-initpostdecbufperiod
   - 3gpp-videopostdecbufsize

INTERNET-DRAFT SDP & RTSP extensions for 3GPP PSS & MBMS  Oct 17, 2006


6.6. Integrity Protection

   The integrity-protection mechanism defined in PSS Annex K uses the
   "3GPP-Freshness-Token" (See Section K.2.2.4 of [PSS-234]) RTSP
   header to carry a freshness token in DESCRIBE requests.

6.7. RTSP URI extension

   The PSS specification also defines syntax for referencing tracks
   within the "3GP" file format [PSS-3GP]. The 3GP format is based on
   the ISO base media file format and defined in several different
   profiles, including a streaming-server profile, in Release 6.

   To identify a track within a 3GP file the last URI segment shall
   contain a structure that is <alpha string>=<track nr> (See 5.3.3.1
   of [PSS-234]).
