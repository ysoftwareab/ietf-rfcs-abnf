1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   In developing this document, we have intentionally avoided some
   terminology used by other protocols - particularly store-and-forward
   protocols - to avoid biases and confusion that may otherwise ensue.

   o  Container - metadata describing the characteristics of application
      /user data to be transported over the network and its forwarding
      requirements as well as a mandatory checksum of that information
      (Shipping Label) and the application/user data to be transported
      over the network as well as an optional checksum of that
      information (Shipping Container).  Containers may consists of one
      or more sub-containers.

   o  Container Aggregation - The process of organizing one or multiple
      containers as sub-containers inside another larger container.

   o  Container Deaggregation - The process of removing one or more sub-
      containers from a larger container.  This differs from

      fragmentation because rather than creating new containers,
      deaggregation operates on existing sub-containers.

   o  Container Fragmentation - The process of dividing a single
      container's contents into multiple new containers which will need
      to be eventually reassembled back into the original container
      before delivery to the application.

   o  Container Reassembly - The process of recombining the contents of
      multiple containers into a single container that they were
      originally part of, and that needs to be delivered to the
      application intact.

   o  Delay - propagation delay between SCF agents.  Delay does not
      include disconnection time.

   o  Disruption - a relatively short period of disconnection within an
      otherwise well-connected network (e.g. a loss of connectivity in
      the range of seconds to perhaps minutes)

   o  Disconnection - a relatively long period where communication
      between a significant proportion of hosts is not possible for
      various reasons (e.g. due to the inability to close a radio link)

   o  Metadata - synonymous with a Container's Label

   o  SCF - Store, Carry and Forward

   o  SF - Store-and-Forward, or "store and forward" as used generically
      in other literature (where the presence of hyphenation varies)

   o  SCF Agent - a protocol instance providing SCF services to an
      upper-layer user/application

   o  Shipping Container - the application/user data to be transported
      over the network as well as an optional checksum of that
      information.

   o  Shipping Label - metadata describing the characteristics of a
      container and its forwarding requirements, as well as a mandatory
      checksum of that information.

   o  Sub-Container - A small container residing inside a larger
      container.

   o  Transport Capacity - (as a first order approximation) the
      combination of bandwidth and contact time.

2.  Introduction

   This document describes the requirements for a Store, Carry and
   Forward (SCF) protocol, and the expectations placed upon the SCF
   agents and SCF applications.

   This Requirements and Expectations document is one of three that
   fully describe the SCF system.  The other two are the problem
   statement and the testing requirements document.

   As background, the SCF Problem Statement
   [I-D.ivancic-scf-problem-statement] is suggested reading.  The SCF
   Problem Statement describes the core SCF problem and gives an
   assessment of the potential to use existing technologies as
   solutions.  In addition, it provides a number of SCF deployment
   scenarios.

3.  Design Considerations

   The following design considerations are explicitly stated with a goal
   of keeping the protocol simple.  (Anyone can make things more
   complicated!)

   o  Do not overload the relaying protocol.  Keep It Simple.

      *  Keep network management functions separate from the relaying
         protocol.

      *  Content Based Networking is different than SCF.  SCF can be
         used to move content, but should not be considered an in-
         network content store.

      *  Rationale: Separation allows for independent development and
         optimizations.

   o  The SCF protocol MUST NOT rely on time synchronization between
      applications or relaying agents.

      *  It is very difficult, if not impossible, to synchronize
         disconnected networks.  Furthermore, if the protocol requires
         synchronization to work, it can never be used to synchronize a
         system - even for coarse synchronization.  In addition,
         reliance on absolute time creates security vulnerabilities.

   o  Protocol options make interoperability hard.  Options are often
      used as a placeholder for fixing a bad design.

   o  Naming and addressing are key to security and scalability.

Internet-Draft              SCF Requirements               December 2013


   o  Addressing should be topological (location dependent).  This
      enables aggregation of the routing locator space and improves
      scalability for the routing system.

   o  Strive to limit the size of the forwarding table.  Large
      forwarding tables place a great burden on the SCF processing
      system.  There is always a limit for any CPU.  The further one is
      removed from reaching that limit, the better.

4.  Protocol Requirements

   The following are a list of requirements for a SCF Protocol.  The
   requirements are specifically written in general terms.  The intent
   is to identify what is required, not how to solve the requirement.
   The requirements are in no particular order of precedence, but are
   numbered in order to aid in referencing for discussion.

   SCF Agent Requirements and Agent operation expectations have been
   intentionally separated, as the SCF Agent requirements are more
   policy-based than protocol-based.  However, one needs to understand
   both in order to effectively implement the SCF protocol.

   PROTOCOL-REQ1:    The SCF relaying protocol MUST be able to handle
                     data sets that are very small (several bytes) and
                     very large (several gigabytes).

                     *  Rationale: SCF is useful for very small, simple,
                        low-power, low-processing minimally-capable
                        sensor systems, as well as for more capable
                        high-end data mules.  In a simple sensor-web one
                        may be moving extremely small containers of
                        information on the order of bytes; whereas later
                        onward delivery by a data mule may be moving
                        containers containing gigabytes of data.

   PROTOCOL-REQ2:    The SCF protocol MUST permit SCF agents to be able
                     to aggregate containers.

                     *  Rationale: Aggregation will reduce forwarding
                        table size and enable pre-processing of
                        forwarding queues.  Without aggregation, the SCF
                        agent processing capabilities can be quickly
                        overwhelmed - particularly for a large number of
                        small containers - even if those containers are
                        destined for the same location.  Aggregation and
                        Deaggregation enable efficient shipping of
                        information through a SCF network from a variety
                        sources to a common destination by continually

Internet-Draft              SCF Requirements               December 2013


                        recombining containers as the information moves
                        through the relay network.

   PROTOCOL-REQ3:    The SCF protocol MUST permit SCF agents to be able
                     to deaggregate containers.

                     *  Rationale: Deaggregation allows subcontainers to
                        be removed from larger aggregated containers and
                        either shipped separately due to contact
                        limitations, or spread out to multiple other
                        relaying SCF agents in parallel.

   PROTOCOL-REQ4:    The SCF protocol MUST permit SCF agents to be able
                     to reactively fragment a container.

                     *  Rationale: It is often not possible to determine
                        how long a contact time will be between SCF
                        agents.  In such instances, which may be the
                        norm, one cannot determine the transport
                        capacity and may only be able to transfer a
                        portion of a container before the contact ends.
                        In order to improve transport efficiency and
                        effectively utilize the radio link, one should
                        not have to retransmit what has already been
                        received.

   PROTOCOL-REQ5:    The SCF protocol SHOULD permit SCF agents to be
                     able to proactively fragment a container.

                     *  Rationale: It may be possible to a priori know
                        the transport capacity between SCF agents.  In
                        such instances, one may determine that an entire
                        container could only be transfer between agents
                        if it is divided into smaller units.  In other
                        cases, a SCF agent may wish to limit the size of
                        containers as a matter of policy.  In either of
                        these cases, proactive fragmentation would be
                        useful.  However, it would be more desirable for
                        the application to limit the size of the
                        container if at all possible, rather than having
                        this done by the SCF agent.

   PROTOCOL-REQ6:    An SCF protocol MUST implement reliability on the
                     Shipping Label, and a damaged Shipping Label MUST
                     NOT propagate to further SCF agents or have its
                     container further propagated or delivered to
                     applications.

Internet-Draft              SCF Requirements               December 2013


                     *  Rationale: An SCF agent needs to be able to
                        determine if the shipping label is damaged in
                        order to prevent misdelivery of data, waste of
                        resources (storage, battery, network capacity,
                        etc.), and other suboptimal results of operating
                        on flawed forwarding information.

   PROTOCOL-REQ7:    An SCF protocol MUST be capable of implementing
                     reliability on the Shipping Container.

                     *  Rationale: An SCF agent must be able to
                        determine if the shipping container is damaged.
                        A damaged Shipping Container MAY be discarded
                        along with the associated Shipping Label.  Note,
                        user of reliability on the Shipping Container is
                        not mandatory, but the ability to have such
                        capability is.

   PROTOCOL-REQ8:    The SCF protocol security implementation MUST
                     authenticate the Shipping Label independent of the
                     Shipping Container.

                     *  Rationale: The ability to authenticate data
                        sources and control resource usage early on is
                        critical to reducing vulnerabilities to denial-
                        of-service attacks, whether intentional or
                        unintentional.  For large containers, if the
                        entire container had to be received and
                        processed before a determination could be made
                        as the the source of the Container, multiple
                        resources would be wasted including bandwidth,
                        processing cycles and storage.

   PROTOCOL-REQ9:    The SCF protocol security implementation MUST work
                     with reactive fragmentation.

                     *  Rationale: For medium- and high-end SCF systems,
                        the ability to authenticate data sources and
                        control resource usage is critical.  Likewise,
                        reactive fragmentation may be quite common and
                        has been shown to be invaluable in transporting
                        large data sets [Multi-Terminal][Multi-
                        Terminal].

   PROTOCOL-REQ10:   The SCF protocol security implementation MUST have
                     a security policy database to control resources.

Internet-Draft              SCF Requirements               December 2013


                     *  Rationale: Once a data source is authenticated,
                        the security policy will determine what type and
                        amount of resources that source can use, as well
                        as possibly the forwarding priorities.  It is
                        anticipated that SCF systems will have different
                        peering arrangements with different entities
                        (e.g. peers, groups, or organizations).

   PROTOCOL-REQ11:   The SCF protocol MUST be able to separate the
                     Shipping Label from the Shipping Container

                     *  Rationale: The SCF agent must be able to
                        determine whether or not it wishes to receive or
                        store a container prior to receiving the entire
                        container.  This reduces denial-of-service
                        vulnerabilities and enables efficient use of
                        radio and system resources.

   PROTOCOL-REQ12:   The SCF protocol MUST have a mechanism that enables
                     data to die naturally.

                     *  Rationale: Data should die naturally to avoid
                        routing loops at the SCF layer.  Routing loops
                        at the SFC layer cannot be eliminated by lower-
                        layer mechanisms (i.e. and IPv6 hop count will
                        not correct an SCF routing loop).

   PROTOCOL-REQ13:   The SCF protocol MUST have a naming mechanism that
                     specifies the application and instance to which the
                     content is bound.

                     *  Rationale: This naming mechanism is necessary in
                        order for the SCF agent end system to pass the
                        Shipping Container content to the proper
                        instance of a given application since multiple
                        instances may be invoked at any given time.

   PROTOCOL-REQ14:   The SCF protocol MUST have a Quality-of-Service
                     (QOS) mechanism to expedite forwarding and to
                     handle storage lifetimes.

                     *  Rationale: Past experiences with other store-
                        and-forward technologies such as DTN [RFC5050]
                        have shown that it is very difficult for many
                        applications to determine how long the useful
                        life of data is.  Rather, bundle lifetimes have
                        been set either arbitrarily or rather coarsely
                        (e.g. short, medium, forever) - see Bundle

                        Lifetimes [1].  QOS will enable and SCF to
                        expedite, store and purge data on a much more
                        coarse scale than the use of absolute or
                        relative time.  Such QOS policies could be a
                        configuration setting within individual SCF
                        agents, or within an SCF network.  This greatly
                        simplifies the protocol processing as well as
                        aggregation and deaggregation of containers.

   PROTOCOL-REQ15:   The SCF protocol MUST have a mechanism for a
                     receiving system to acknowledge reception of a
                     container from the sending system (i.e. hop-by-hop
                     acknowledgements).

                     *  Rationale: This allows a sending system to
                        release the container if it so desires, thereby
                        improving resource usage.

   PROTOCOL-REQ16:   The SCF protocol MUST have a mechanism to notify a
                     sender that the container will not be processed.

                     *  Rationale: If the agent's policy states "Do not
                        accept" for any possible reason, it is important
                        to inform the sender as soon as possible (ASAP)
                        that the container will not be accepted, to
                        allow the sender to stop transmission and
                        determine a different route for that container.
                        Note, there may be security reasons not to
                        provide this information, but in generally such
                        a response SHOULD be sent.

   PROTOCOL-REQ17:   The SCF protocol SHOULD have a mechanism that
                     enables one to identify fresh versus stale content
                     for a given flow.

                     *  Rationale: Fresh data is often of far greater
                        value than stale data.  The ability to identify
                        fresh data and either replace the stale data
                        with fresh, or send the fresh data first, is
                        highly desirable in order to optimize resource
                        usage - particularly storage and bandwidth.

                     *  Comment: There appears to be a desire in many
                        instances to proactively create fixed bundle
                        sizes in DTN and then what the application to
                        put them back in order.  With proactive
                        fragmentation, this is possible and there is a
                        mechanism to allow reordering.  With straight

                        bundling, this is problematic as there is no
                        such formalized standard sequencing (i.e.
                        sequence numbers).

5.  Agent Requirements and Expectations

   The following are a list of requirements for an SCF Agent.  The
   requirements are in no particular order of precedence, but are
   numbered in order to aid in referencing for discussion.

   AGENT-REQ1:  An SCF agent MUST NOT be required to implement SCF
                security.  Security must be optional.

                *  Rationale: Simple devices such as sensors may wish to
                   utilize the SCF protocol, but have neither the need
                   for security, nor the processing capability to
                   implement SCF security.

   AGENT-REQ2:  An SCF agent MAY implement reliability on the Shipping
                Container.

                *  Rationale: An application may or may not care if the
                   contents of the container arrive without
                   modification.  For example, protecting a large image
                   file from a bit flip may not be considered as
                   important as reducing the processing overheard of
                   creating and checking reliability on the Shipping
                   Container.

   AGENT-REQ3:  An SCF agent MUST hold onto a container until it can
                either be transferred or QOS policy indicates its useful
                lifetime has expired or storage resources reach a level
                that requires some purging of containers based on
                policy.

                *  Rationale: The sender expects the receiver to do its
                   best to forward the container, and MAY release the
                   container upon notification from the receiver that
                   the container has been received.  If the receiver
                   does not plan to hold onto the container, it SHOULD
                   send a notification to the sender stating such.

   AGENT-REQ4:  An SCF agent MAY remove a container once it receives
                notification from the next hop SCF that the container
                has been delivered.

                *  Rationale: The ability to release containers enables
                   efficient use of storage resources.  Note, some



Ivancic, et al.           Expires June 16, 2014                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft              SCF Requirements               December 2013


                   deployments and some routing protocols MAY mandate
                   that the agent retain a container even after a
                   successful transfer.  In such deployments, containers
                   would likely be removed based on a retention policy
                   which may be based on QOS.

   AGENT-REQ5:  An SCF agent SHOULD NOT accept a container if it has no
                intention of giving a best effort to forward the
                container.

                *  Rationale: The sending SCF's default expectation is
                   that, if accepted, the receiving SCF will do its best
                   to forward the container.  This allows the sending
                   SCF, if so desired, to purge the container from its
                   storage with some confidence that the container will
                   be delivered.

   AGENT-REQ6:  An SCF agent SHOULD implement a policy system that
                controls resources.  Such a policy system MAY include
                the filters described below.

                *  Rationale: Resources including bandwidth and storage
                   storage are precious commodities that need to be
                   controlled.  Various SCF deployments are expected to
                   have vastly different capabilities and needs.  For
                   example, an SCF science sensorweb may have not need
                   for security, while implementing a policy that
                   basically says "Accept Everything", because all
                   containers are know a priori to be small and the
                   deployment is a closed network.  Other deployments
                   may consist of high-end SCF agents supporting
                   multiple organizations and transferring and storing
                   Gigabytes or more of information.  The ability to
                   tune the policies to fit the deployment makes such
                   deployments realizable.



      (a)  What volume (size) container will be accepted.

           +  Rationale: Storage resources are not infinite.  It is
              likely policy will limit container size and/or overall
              memory allocations per source, address range, or other
              filters.  In addition, some SCF agents may have limited
              processing and not be willing or capable of handling
              extremely large containers

Internet-Draft              SCF Requirements               December 2013


      (b)  What sources are permitted to use resources and how much
           resource?

           +  Rationale: Resources including bandwidth and storage are
              precious.  It is anticipated that peering arrangements
              will exist to populate this database.  Not every source
              may be permitted to utilize the resources.

      (c)  What destinations are permitted to use resources and how much
           resource?

           +  Rationale: Resources including bandwidth and storage are
              precious.  It is anticipated that peering arrangements
              will exist to populate this database.  Not every
              destination may be permitted to utilize the resources.

      (d)  Prioritized container delivery.

           +  Rationale: It is anticipated that peering arrangements
              will exist to populate this database.  Some peers are
              likely to be given preferential treatment, while others
              may be serviced only after all commitments have been met,
              regardless of QoS (e.g. the general's containers are
              processed before the private's; the organization who owns
              the SCF agent gets preferential treatment over all other
              organizations.

      (e)  A mapping of QoS to retention lifetime and forwarding
           priority.

           +  Rationale: A coarse-grained retention policy is
              anticipated.  Such granularity may be minutes, hours,
              days, forever (until resources become scarce and memory
              must be released).  This alleviates the need for actual
              lifetime settings within the SCF protocol and allows
              various deployments to be uniquely configured.

   AGENT-REQ7:  If security is implemented, when coming in contact with
                one another, adjacent SCF agents MUST minimally be able
                to identify one another securely and prove that they can
                be trusted as relays for a given destination
                application.

                *  Rationale: Such a mechanism is necessary to prevent
                   hijacking of information.  Also, aggregation and
                   deaggregation may be implemented along a container's
                   route.  Trust between forwarding agents must be
                   established to enable this.

Internet-Draft              SCF Requirements               December 2013


   AGENT-REQ8:  SCF Agents MUST be able to indicate (or deny) forwarding
                of individual containers, based on exchanging their
                shipping labels only.

                *  Rationale: This allows for efficient use of RF
                   resources as well as reducing DOS vulnerabilities.
                   It the SCF Agent had to process an entire Container
                   prior to denying acceptance, a malicious entity could
                   easily perform a DOS attack by sending extremely
                   large containers which would have to be stored and
                   processed by the receiving SCF prior to rejection.

   AGENT-REQ9:  SCF Agents MAY notify applications of pending received
                data.

                *  Rationale: If the SCF agent knows it is bound to an
                   application and can notify the application of pending
                   received data, this could improve the application's
                   operations.

6.  Application Requirements and Expectations

   APPLICATION-REQ1:  Applications SHOULD be designed to operate in a
                      disconnected systems.

                      *  Rationale: Applications that have been designed
                         assuming a connected network are likely to
                         break.

                      *  Rationale: Streaming may work, but should not
                         be encouraged as streaming applications with
                         reasonably significant volumes of traffic are
                         likely to only work for connected systems or
                         very short fades.  Such systems probably do not
                         need SCF.

   APPLICATION-REQ2:  Applications MUST be able to select their own
                      globally-unique identifiers and notify SCF agents
                      of them, along with providing proof of ownership.

                      *  Rational:

   APPLICATION-REQ3:  Applications MUST be able to poll a SCF agent for
                      pending received data.

                      *  Rationale: Applications are the only ones that
                         can keep track of the shared state between
                         sender and receiver.  The Application cannot

                         expect lower layers such as the SCF agent to
                         fully understand its needs.

                      *  Rationale: This eliminates putting undue burden
                         on the SCF, and ensures interoperability to
                         specify a known operational expectation.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document does not specify a protocol or implementation, only the
   requirements set.  The rationale for individual requirements related
   to security includes discussion of the security considerations that
   motivate them.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document neither creates nor updates any registries or
   codepoints, so there are no IANA Considerations.
