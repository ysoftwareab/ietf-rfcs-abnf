1.  Introduction

   Modern video coding standards such as Thor [I-D.fuldseth-netvc-thor]
   include in-loop filters which correct artifacts introduced in the
   encoding process.  Thor includes a deblocking filter which correct
   artifacts introduced by the block based nature of the encoding
   process, and a low pass filter correcting artifacts not corrected by
   the deblocking filter, in particular artifacts introduced by
   quantisation errors of transform coefficients and by the
   interpolation filter.  Since in-loop filters have to be applied in
   both the encoder and decoder, it is highly desirable that these
   filters have low computational complexity.

                     Figure 1: Filter pixel positions

   In Thor the frames are divided into filter blocks (FB) of 128x128
   pixels and each FB can be divided into a quadtree of coding blocks
   (CB) which can range from 8x8 to 128x128.  The filter described in
   this draft can be switched on or off for the entire frame or
   optionally on or off for each FB.  CB's that have been coded using
   the skip mode are not filtered, and if all CB's within a FB have been
   been coded in skip mode, the FB will not be filtered and no signal
   will be transmitted to indicate this.

3.  Filtering Process

   Given a pixel X and its neighbouring pixels described above we can
   define a general non-linear filter as:


X' = X + clip(a*clip(A-X,-s,s) + b*clip(B-X,-s,s) + c*clip(C-X,-s,s) +
              d*clip(D-X,-s,s) + e*clip(E-X,-s,s) + f*clip(F-X,-s,s),-g,g)


                           Figure 2: Equation 1

   If a neighbour pixel is outside the image frame, it is given the same
   value as the closes pixel within the frame.  To avoid dependencies
   prohibiting parallel processing, all neighbour pixels must be the
   unfiltered pixels of the frame being filtered.

   Experiments in Thor have shown that a good compromise between
   complexity and performance is a=f=0.25, b=e=0.0625, c=d=0.1875 and
   the filter strength s being 1, 2 or 4 signalled at frame level.
   These values eliminate the need for the outer clipping to +/-g.  The
   rounding is to the nearest integer.

   This gives us the equation:

   X' = X + (4*clip(A-X,-s,s) + clip(B-X,-s,s) + 3*clip(C-X,-s,s) +
             3*clip(D-X,-s,s) + clip(E-X,-s,s) + 4*clip(F-X,-s,s)) / 16


                           Figure 3: Equation 2

   It can be noted that a=c=d=f=0.25, b=e=0 and s=1 give a slighly
   simpler filter which is very similar to the one described in the
   first version of this draft.

   The filter leaves the encoder seven different choices for a frame:

   1.  The frame is not filtered.

   2.  The frame is filtered with s=1 and all non-skip CB's are
       filtered.

   3.  The frame is filtered with s=2 and all non-skip CB's are
       filtered.

   4.  The frame is filtered with s=4 and all non-skip CB's are
       filtered.

   5.  The frame is filtered with s=1 and one bit per FB is sent to
       indicate whether all non-skip CB's in the FB must be filtered.

   6.  The frame is filtered with s=2 and one bit per FB is sent to
       indicate whether all non-skip CB's in the FB must be filtered.

   7.  The frame is filtered with s=4 and one bit per FB is sent to
       indicate whether all non-skip CB's in the FB must be filtered.

   The decisions at both frame level and FB level may be based on rate-
   distortion optimisation (RDO), but an encoder running in a low-
   complexity mode, or possibly a low-delay mode, may instead assume
   that a fixed mode will be beneficial.  In general, using s=2 and RDO
   only at the FB level gives good results.  Applying the filter to all
   non-skip CB with no RDO at either frame level or FB level gives a
   poorer result, and will not unfrequently lower the PSNR of the frame,
   in particular if the frame already had near lossless quality.

   However, because of the low complexity of the filter, fully RDO based
   decisions are not costly.  The distortion of the six configurations
   of the filter can easily be computed in a single pass.

   The filter is applied after the deblocking filter.

4.  Complexity considerations

   The filter has been designed to offer the best compromise between low
   complexity and performance.  A single pixel can be filtered with
   simple operations as illustrated by this C function:


 int clpf_sample(int X, int A, int B, int C, int D, int E, int F, int s)
 {
   int delta =
     4*clip(A - X, -s, s) + clip(B - X, -s, s) + 3*clip(C - X, -s, s) +
     3*clip(D - X, -s, s) + clip(E - X, -s, s) + 4*clip(F - X, -s, s);
   return (8 + delta - (delta < 0)) >> 4;
 }


                             Figure 4: C code

   Also, these operations are easily vectorised in architectures
   supporting SIMD instructions, such as x86/SSE4 and ARM/NEON.  The
   pixel difference is 9 bit, but it can be computed using adding an 8
   bit offset and the use of 8 bit saturated signed subtraction.  This
   means that 16 pixels per core can be filtered in parallel on these
   architectures.  Clipping at frame borders can be implemented using
   shuffle instructions.

   A C implementation using x86/SSE4 intrinsics required 6.8
   instructions per pixel to filter a single 8x8 block.  The
   corresponding number for ARM/NEON (armv7) was 4.9.  The compiler was
   gcc 4.8.4 in both cases.

   Since the filter only needs to look up pixels in the line directly
   above and below the pixel to be filtered, the line buffer requirement
   in hardware implementations is very low.

5.  Performance

   The table below show filters effect on the bandwidth for a selection
   of 10 second video sequences encoded in Thor with uni-prediction
   only.  The numbers have been computed using the Bjontegaard Delta
   Rate (BDR).  BDR-low and BDR-high indicate the effect at low and bigh
   bitrates respectively.  The effect of the filter was tested in two
   encoder configurations: high complexity in which the encoder strongly
   favours compression efficiency over CPU usage, and medium complexity
   which is more suited for real-time applications.  The bandwidth
   reduction is somewhat less in the high complexity configuration.

   Whilst the filter objectively performs better at relatively high
   bitrates, the subjective effect seems better at relatively low
   bitrates, and overall the subjective effect seems better than what
   the objective numbers suggest.

   If bi-prediction is allowed, there is generally less bandwidth
   reduction as the table below shows.
