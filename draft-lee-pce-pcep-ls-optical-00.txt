   PCEP Extension for Distribution of Link-State and TE information for
                             Optical Networks



                     draft-lee-pce-pcep-ls-optical-00


Abstract

   In order to compute and provide optimal paths, Path Computation
   Elements (PCEs) require an accurate and timely Traffic Engineering
   Database (TED). Traditionally this Link State and TE information has
   been obtained from a link state routing protocol (supporting traffic
   engineering extensions).

   This document extends the Path Communication Element Communication
   Protocol (PCEP)_ with Link-State and TE information for optical
   networks.

1. Introduction

   In Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS
   (GMPLS), a Traffic Engineering Database (TED) is used in computing
   paths for connection oriented packet services and for circuits. The
   TED contains all relevant information that a Path Computation
   Element (PCE) needs to perform its computations. It is important
   that the TED should be complete and accurate anytime so that the PCE
   can perform path computations.

   In MPLS and GMPLS networks, Interior Gateway routing Protocols
   (IGPs) have been used to create and maintain a copy of the TED at
   each node. One of the benefits of the PCE architecture [RFC4655] is
   the use of computationally more sophisticated path computation
   algorithms and the realization that these may need enhanced
   processing power not necessarily available at each node
   participating in an IGP.

   Section 4.3 of [RFC4655] describes the potential load of the TED on
   a network node and proposes an architecture where the TED is
   maintained by the PCE rather than the network nodes. However it does
   not describe how a PCE would obtain the information needed to
   populate its TED. PCE may construct its TED by participating in the
   IGP ([RFC3630] and [RFC5305] for MPLS-TE; [RFC4203] and [RFC5307]
   for GMPLS). An alternative is offered by [BGP-LS].

   [RFC7399] touches upon this issue: "It has also been proposed that
   the PCE Communication Protocol (PCEP) [RFC5440] could be extended to
   serve as an information collection protocol to supply information
   from network devices to a PCE. The logic is that the network devices
   may already speak PCEP and so the protocol could easily be used to
   report details about the resources and state in the network,
   including the LSP state discussed in Sections 14 and 15."

   [Stateful-PCE] describes a set of extensions to PCEP to provide
   stateful control.  A stateful PCE has access to not only the
   information carried by the network's Interior Gateway Protocol
   (IGP), but also the set of active paths and their reserved resources
   for its computations. PCC can delegate the rights to modify the LSP
   parameters to an Active Stateful PCE. This requires PCE to quickly
   be updated on any changes in the Topology and TEDB, so that PCE can
   meet the need for updating LSPs effectively and in a timely manner.
   The fastest way for a PCE to be updated on TED changes is via a
   direct interface with each network node and with incremental update
   from each network node.

   [PCE-initiated] describes the setup, maintenance and teardown of
   PCE-initiated LSPs under the stateful PCE model, without the need
   for local configuration on the PCC, thus allowing for a dynamic
   network that is centrally controlled and deployed. This model
   requires timely topology and TED update at the PCE.

   [PCEP-LS-Arch] proposes alternative architecture approaches for
   learning and maintaining the Link State (and TE)  information
   directly on a PCE from network nodes as an alternative to IGPs and
   BGP transport and investigate the impact from the PCE, routing
   protocol, and network node perspectives.

   [RFC6805] describes a Hierarchical PCE (H-PCE) architecture which
   can be used for computing end-to-end paths for inter-domain MPLS
   Traffic Engineering (TE) and GMPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs).
   Within the Hierarchical PCE (H-PCE) architecture [RFC6805], the
   Parent PCE (P-PCE) is used to compute a multi-domain path based on
   the domain connectivity information.  A Child PCE (C-PCE) may be
   responsible for a single domain or multiple domains, it is used to
   compute the intra-domain path based on its domain topology
   information.

   [Stateful H-PCE] presents general considerations for stateful PCE(s)
   in hierarchical PCE architecture. In particular, the behavior
   changes and additions to the existing stateful PCE mechanisms
   (including PCE-initiated LSP setup and active PCE usage) in the
   context of networks using the H-PCE architecture.

   [PCEP-LS] describes a mechanism by which Link State and TE
   information can be collected from packet networks and shared with
   PCE with the PCEP itself. This is achieved using a new PCEP message
   format.

   This draft describes an optical extension of [PCEP-LS] and explains
   how encodings suggested by [PCEP-LS] can be used in the optical
   network contexts.





2. Applicability

   There are three main applicability of this alternative proposed by
   this draft:




Lee                   Expires February 31, 2017                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft         PCEP LS for Optical Networks         August 2016


      - Case 1: Where there is IGP running in optical network but
         there is a need for a faster link-state and TE resource
         collection at the PCE directly from an optical node (PCC) via
         a PCC-PCE interface.

           o A PCE may receive an incremental update (as opposed to
              the entire TE information of the node/link).


         Note: A PCE may receive full information from IGP using
         existing mechanism. In some cases, the convergence of full
         link-state and TE resource information of the entire network
         may not be appropriate for certain applications. Incremental
         update capability will enhance the accuracy of the TE
         information at a given time.


      - Case 2: Where there is no IGP running in the optical network
         and there is a need for link-state and TE resource collections
         at the PCE directly from an optical node (PCC) via a PCC-PCE
         interface.


      - Case 3: Where there is a need for transporting abstract
         optical link-state and TE information from child PCE and to a
         parent PCE in H-PCE [RFC6805] and [Stateful H-PCE] as well as
         for Physical Network Controller (PNC) to Multi-Domain Service
         Coordinator (MDSC) in Abstraction and Control of TE Networks
         (ACTN) [ACTN-Frame].

         Note: The applicability for Case 3 may arise as a consequence
         of Case 1 and Case 2. When TE information changes occur in the
         optical network, this may also affect abstracted TE
         information and thus needs to be updated to Parent PCE/MSDC
         from each child PCE/PNC.



3. Requirements for PCEP extension


   The key requirements associated with link-state (and TE)
   distribution are identified for PCEP and listed in Section 4 of
   [PCEP-LS]. These new functions required in PCEP to support
   distribution of link-state (and TE) information are described in
   Section 5 of [PCEP-LS]. Details of PCEP messages and related
   Objects/TLVs are specified in Sections 8 and 9 of [PCEP-LS]. The key

Internet-Draft         PCEP LS for Optical Networks         August 2016


   requirements and new functions specified in [PCEP-LS] are equally
   applicable to optical networks.

   Section 4 in this draft will specify additional PCEP-LS extension
   for Optical Networks.

5. Security Considerations

   This document extends PCEP for LS (and TE) distribution including a
   set of TLVs.  Procedures and protocol extensions defined in this
   document do not effect the overall PCEP security model.  See
   [RFC5440], [I-D.ietf-pce-pceps]. The PCE implementation SHOULD
   provide mechanisms to prevent strains created by network flaps and
   amount of LS (and TE) information.  Thus it is suggested that any
   mechanism used for securing the transmission of other PCEP message
   be applied here as well.  As a general precaution, it is RECOMMENDED
   that these PCEP extensions only be activated on authenticated and
   encrypted sessions belonging to the same administrative authority.

6. IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA actions to allocate code points for the
   protocol elements defined in this document.

6.1. PCEP-LS Sub-TLV Type Indicators

   This document specifies a set of PCEP-LS Sub-TLVs. IANA is requested
   to create an "PCEP-LS Sub-TLV Types" sub-registry in the "PCEP TLV
   Type Indicators" for the sub-TLVs carried in the PCEP-LS TLV (Node
   Attributes TLV and Link Attributes TLV).
