INTERNET-DRAFT                         Architecture for CU Separated BNG


1. Introduction

   A Broadband Network Gateway (BNG) device is defined as an Ethernet-
   centric IP edge router, and the aggregation point for the user
   traffic. It performs Ethernet aggregation and packet forwarding via
   IP/MPLS, and supports user management, access protocols termination,
   QoS and policy management, etc.

   This document introduce an architecture for BNG devices with control
   plane (CP) and user plane (UP) separation. BNG-CP is a user control
   management component while BNG-UP takes responsibility as the network
   edge and user policy implementation components. Both BNG-CP and BNG-
   UP are core components for fixed broadband services and are deployed
   separately at different network layers in the network.



1.1 Motivation

   The rapid development of new services, such as 4K, IoT, etc., and
   increasing numbers of home broadband service users present some new
   challenges for BNGs such as:

      Low resource utilization: The traditional BNG acts as both a
      gateway for user access authentication and accounting and an IP
      network's Layer 3 edge. The mutually affecting nature of the
      tightly coupled control plane and forwarding plane makes it
      difficult to achieve the maximum performance of either plane.

      Complex management and maintenance: Due to the large numbers of
      traditional BNGs, a network must have each device configured one
      at a time when deploying global service policies. As the network
      expands and new services are introduced, this deployment mode will
      cease to be feasible as it is unable to manage services
      effectively and rectify faults rapidly.

      Slow service provisioning: The coupling of control plane and
      forwarding plane, in addition to a distributed network control
      mechanism, means that any new technology has to rely heavily on
      the existing network devices.

   To address these challenges for fixed networks, a cloud-based BNG
   with CU separation conception is defined in [TR-384]. The main idea
   of Control-Plane and User-Plane separation is to extract and
   centralize the user management functions of multiple BNG devices,
   forming an unified and centralized control plane (CP). And the
   traditional router's Control Plane and Forwarding Plane are both
   preserved on BNG devices in the form of a user plane (UP). Note that
   the CU separation concept has also be introduced in the 3GPP 5G
   architecture [3GPP.23.501].

2. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The following acronyms are used as specified below:

   AAA: Authentication Authorization Accounting.

   BNG: Broadband Network Gateway. A broadband remote access server
       (BRAS (Broadband Access Server), B-RAS or BBRAS) that routes
       traffic to and from broadband remote access devices such as
       digital subscriber line access multiplexers (DSLAM) on an
       Internet service provider's (ISP) network. BRAS can also be
       referred to as a Broadband Network Gateway (BNG).

   CP: Control Plane. The CP is a user control management component
       which manages the UP's resources such as the user entry and
       user's QoS policy

   DHCP: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol.

   MANO: Management and Orchestration.

   NFV: Network Function Virtualization.

   NFVI: NFV Infrastructure.

   PPPoE: Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet.

   UP: User Plane. UP is a network edge and user policy implementation
       component. The traditional router's Control Plane and forwarding
       plane are both preserved on BNG devices in the form of a user
       plane.

3. CU Separated BNG Architecture

   The functions in a traditional BNG can be divided into two parts: one
   is the user access management function, the other is the router
   function. In a cloud-based BNG, we find that tearing these two
   functions apart can make a difference. The user management function
   can be centralized and deployed as a concentrated module or device,
   which can be called BNG-CP (Control Plane). The other functions, such
   as the router function and forwarding engine, can be deployed in the
   form of the BNG User Plane. Thus the Cloud-based BNG architecture is
   made up of control plane and user plane.

   The following figure describes the architecture of CU separated BNG:

                Figure 1. Architecture of CU Separated BNG

   As in Figure 1, the BNG Control Plane could be virtualized and
   centralized, which provides significant benefits such as centralized
   session management, flexible address allocation, high scalability for
   subscriber management capacity, and cost-efficient redundancy, etc.


Hu, et al                                                       [Page 5]

INTERNET-DRAFT                         Architecture for CU Separated BNG


   The functional components inside the BNG Service Control Plane can be
   implemented as Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) and hosted in a
   Network Function Virtualization Infrastructure (NFVI).

   The User Plane Management module in the BNG control plane centrally
   manages the distributed BNG User Planes (e.g. load balancing), as
   well as the setup, deletion, and maintenance of channels between
   Control Planes and User Planes. Other modules in the BNG control
   plane, such as address management, AAA, etc., are responsible for the
   connection with outside subsystems in order to fulfill those
   services. Note that the User Plane SHOULD support both physical and
   virtual network functions. For example, BNG user plane L3 forwarding
   related network functions can be disaggregated and distributed across
   the physical infrastructure. And the other control plane and
   management plane functions in the CU Separation BNG can be moved into
   the NFVI for virtualization [TR-384].

   The details of CU separated BNG's function components are as
   following:

   The Control Plane should supports:

   (1) Address management: unified address pool management.

   (2) AAA: This component performs Authentication, Authorization and
       Accounting, together with Radius/DIAMETER. The BNG communicates
       with the AAA server to check whether the subscriber who sent an
       Access-Request has network access authority. Once the subscriber
       goes online, this component together with the Service Control
       component implement accounting, data capacity limitation, and QoS
       enforcement policies.

   (3) Subscriber management: user entry management and forwarding
       policy management.

   (4) PPPoE/IPoE: process user dialup packets of PPPoE/IPoE.

   (5) UP management: management of UP interface status, and the setup,
       deletion, and maintenance of channels between CP and UP.

   The User Plane should supports:

   (1) Control plane functions including routing, multicast, and MPLS.

   (2) Forwarding plane functions including traffic forwarding, QoS and
       traffic statistics collection.

3.1 Internal Interfaces Between the CP and UP

   To support the communication between the Control Plane and User
   Plane, several interfaces are involved. Figure 2 illustrates the
   internal interfaces of CU Separated BNG.

             +-----------------------------------+

      Figure 2. Internal Interfaces Between the CP and UP of the BNG

   Service Interface: The CP and UP use this interface to establish
             VXLAN tunnels with each other and transmit PPPoE and IPoE
             packets over the VXLAN tunnels which are present in
             [hu-nvo3-vxlan-gpe-extension-for-vbng].

   Control Interface: The CP uses this interface to deliver service
             entries, and the UP uses this interface to report service
             events to the CP. The requirements of this interface is
             introduced in [cuspdt-rtgwg-cusp-requirements], and the
             carrying protocol is presented in
             [cuspdt-rtgwg-cu-separation-bng-protocol], the information
             model of this interface is presented in
             [cuspdt-rtgwg-cu-separation-infor-model].

   Management Interface: The CP uses this interface to deliver
             configurations to the UP. This interface runs NETCONF
             [cusp-rtgwg-cu-separation-yang-model].

4. Usage of the CU Separation BNG

   In the CU separated BNG scenario, there are several processes when a
   home user accesses the Internet:

   (1) User dialup packets of PPPoE or IPoE from BNG-UP that will be
       send to the BNG-CP from a BNG-UP's Service Interface.

   (2) BNG-CP processes the dialup packet. Confirming with the outside
       neighboring systems in the management network, BNG-CP makes the
       decision to permit or deny the dial through certification.

   (3) After that, the BNG-CP tells the UP to do the responding
       forwarding actions with related policies.

   (4) If the user is certificated and permitted, the UP forwards the
       traffic into the Internet with related policies such as limited
       bandwidth, etc. Otherwise, the user is denied to access the
       Internet.

   In the actual deployment, a CU separated BNG device is composed of a
   CP and one or more UPs. The CP is centrally deployed and takes
   responsibility as a user control management component managing UP's
   resources such as the user entry and forwarding policy. A UP is
   distributed in the bottom of the figure acting as a network edge and
   user policy implementation component.

   In order to fulfill a service, neighboring policy and resource
   management systems are deployed outside. In the neighboring system,
   different service systems such as Radius/DIAMETER. server, DHCP
   server and EMS are included. If BNG-CP is virtualized as a NFV, the
   NFVI management system MANO is also included here. A BNG-CP has
   connections with the outside neighboring systems to transmit
   management traffic.

   The deployment scenario is shown in the following figure:
