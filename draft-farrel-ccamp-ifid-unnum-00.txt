Abstract

   This document provides a means to identify component links that are
   bundled within an unnumbered interface. This feature is required
   during Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS)
   establishment of Label Switched Paths (LSPs) that utilize such
   component links. Similarly, it is useful in error reporting for
   such LSPs.

0.4. Why is it Targeted at this WG

   GMPLS is worked on by the CCAMP WG.

   This is a core requirement for GMPLS signaling and reporting
   errors on unnumbered links. This makes it immediately in scope.

0.5. Justification

   [RFC3471] and [RFC3473] define how component links of numbered
   bundles may be identified within the IF_ID PHOP and IF_ID
   ERROR_SPEC objects.

   [RFC3477] defines how unnumbered links may be used in RSVP-TE.

   [RFC3471] and [RFC3473] define how unnumbered links may be identified
   within the IF_ID PHOP and IF_ID ERROR_SPEC objects.

   There is no provision for identifying component links of unnumbered
   bundles within the IF_ID PHOP and IF_ID ERROR_SPEC objects. This is
   required for completeness and to allow full functionality of GMPLS.

1. Introduction

   GMPLS offers support for bundled links to presented as a single
   interface [RFC3471, RFC3473]. This has configuration and management
   benefits.

   GMPLS [RFC3471, RFC3473] recognises the value of specifying
   interfaces both during LSP establishment for out-of-band signaling
   (IF_ID PHOP object), and for error reporting (IF_ID ERROR_SPEC
   object). This is achieved using TLVs in these objects to specify the
   interface identifier. Both numbered and unnumbered interfaces are
   supported.

   Further, GMPLS [RFC3471, RFC3473] recognises the value of specifying
   the component link of a link bundle during LSP establishment (IF_ID
   PHOP object), and for error reporting (IF_ID ERROR_SPEC object). This
   is achieved using TLVs in these objects to specify the interface
   identifier and component link identifier. Numbered bundles of
   component links are supported. However, no provision is made for
   unnumbered bundles of component links.

   This document extends the TLV definitions of [RFC3471] to provide the
   means to identify component links of unnumbered bundles within the
   IF_ID PHOP and IF_ID ERROR_SPEC objects.

2. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]

3. Existing Interface Identifiers

   [RFC3471] defines IF_ID TLVs to identify links. These TLVs
   are applied in [RFC3473] in the IF_ID PHOP Object during LSP
   establishment, and in the IF_ID ERROR_SPEC Object to identify the
   failed link which is usually the downstream link from the reporting
   node.

   The following set of TLVs are defined in [RFC3471].

   Type Length Format     Description
   --------------------------------------------------------------------
    1      8   IPv4 Addr. IPv4                    (Interface address)
    2     20   IPv6 Addr. IPv6                    (Interface address)
    3     12   Compound   IF_INDEX                (Interface index)
    4     12   Compound   COMPONENT_IF_DOWNSTREAM (Component interface)
    5     12   Compound   COMPONENT_IF_UPSTREAM   (Component interface)

4. New Interface Identifiers

   Two new TLVs are defined for use in the IF_ID PHOP Object and in the
   IF_ID ERROR_SPEC Object. Note that the Type values shown here are
   only suggested values - final values are TBD and to be determined by
   IETF consensus.

   Two TLVs are provided to allow the forward and reverse paths to be
   separately identified.

   Type Length Format     Description
   --------------------------------------------------------------------
    6     16   See below  UNUM_COMPONENT_IF_DOWN  (Component interface)
    7     16   See below  UNUM_COMPONENT_IF_UP    (Component interface)

4.1 TLV Definitions

   The new TLVs have a common format as shown below.

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                            IP Address                         |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                           Interface ID                        |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                           Component ID                        |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

       IP Address: 32 bits

          Any IP address associated with the local node.

       Interface ID: 32 bits

          The identifier of the unnumbered bundled link. By definition,
          this is unique within the scope of the node identified by
          the IP Address field.

draft-farrel-ccamp-ifid-unnum-00.txt                        January 2004

       Component ID: 32 bits

          A component in the bundled link identified by the Interface
          ID. During LSP establishment, the special value 0xFFFFFFFF can
          be used to indicate the same label to be valid across all
          component links in the bundle identified by the Interface ID.

4.1 Procedures

   The procedures are unmodified from [RFC3471], [RFC3473] and
   [RFC3477].

5. IANA Considerations

5.1 IF_ID_ERROR_SPEC TLVs

   Note that the IF_ID TLV type values are not currently tracked or
   managed by IANA. This might be a good opportunity to move them under
   IANA control.

6. Security Considerations

   The extensions in this document make no changes to the security
   provisions in [RFC3473].

7. Acknowledgments

   We would like to thank the authors of [CRANKBACK] where these
   proposals originally appeared.
