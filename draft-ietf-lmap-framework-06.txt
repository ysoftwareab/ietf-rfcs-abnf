        A framework for large-scale measurement platforms (LMAP)
                      draft-ietf-lmap-framework-06

Abstract

   Measuring broadband service on a large scale requires a description
   of the logical architecture and standardisation of the key protocols
   that coordinate interactions between the components.  The document
   presents an overall framework for large-scale measurements.  It also
   defines terminology for LMAP (large-scale measurement platforms).

1.  Introduction

   There is a desire to be able to coordinate the execution of broadband
   measurements and the collection of measurement results across a large
   scale set of diverse devices.  These devices could be software based
   agents on PCs, embedded agents in consumer devices (e.g. blu-ray
   players), service provider controlled devices such as set-top players
   and home gateways, or simply dedicated probes.  It is expected that
   such a system could easily comprise 100,000 devices.  Measurement
   devices may also be embedded on a device that is part of an ISP's
   network, such as a DSLAM, router, Carrier Grade NAT or ISP Gateway.
   Such a scale presents unique problems in coordination, execution and
   measurement result collection.  Several use cases have been proposed
   for large-scale measurements including:

   o  Operators: to help plan their network and identify faults

Internet-Draft               LMAP Framework                    June 2014


   o  Regulators: to benchmark several network operators and support
      public policy development

   Further details of the use cases can be found in
   [I-D.ietf-lmap-use-cases].  The LMAP framework should be useful for
   these, as well as other use cases, such as to help end users run
   diagnostic checks like a network speed test.

   The LMAP Framework has three basic elements: Measurement Agents,
   Controllers and Collectors.

   Measurement Agents (MAs) initiate the actual measurements, which are
   called Measurement Tasks in the LMAP terminology.  In principle,
   there are no restrictions on the type of device in which the MA
   function resides.

   The Controller instructs one or more MAs and communicates the set of
   Measurement Tasks an MA should perform and when.  For example it may
   instruct a MA at a home gateway: "Measure the 'UDP latency' with
   www.example.org; repeat every hour at xx.05".  The Controller also
   manages a MA by instructing it how to report the Measurement Results,
   for example: "Report results once a day in a batch at 4am".  We refer
   to these as the Measurement Schedule and Report Schedule.

   The Collector accepts Reports from the MAs with the Results from
   their Measurement Tasks.  Therefore the MA is a device that gets
   Instructions from the Controller, initiates the Measurement Tasks,
   and reports to the Collector.  The communications between these three
   LMAP functions are structured according to a Control Protocol and a
   Report Protocol.

   The desirable features for a large-scale measurement systems we are
   designing for are:

   o  Standardised - in terms of the Measurement Tasks that they
      perform, the components, the data models and protocols for
      transferring information between the components.  Amongst other
      things, standardisation enables meaningful comparisons of
      measurements made of the same metric at different times and
      places, and provides the operator of a measurement system with a
      criteria for evaluation of the different solutions that can be
      used for various purposes including buying decisions (such as
      buying the various components from different vendors).  Today's
      systems are proprietary in some or all of these aspects.

   o  Large-scale - [I-D.ietf-lmap-use-cases] envisages Measurement
      Agents in every home gateway and edge device such as set-top-boxes
      and tablet computers, and located throughout the Internet as well

      [I-D.ietf-ippm-lmap-path].  It is expected that a measurement
      system could easily encompass a few hundred thousand or even
      millions of Measurement Agents.  Existing systems have up to a few
      thousand MAs (without judging how much further they could scale).

   o  Diversity - a measurement system should handle different types of
      Measurement Agents - for example Measurement Agents may come from
      different vendors, be in wired and wireless networks, be able to
      execute different sorts of Measurement Task and be on devices with
      IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.

2.  Outline of an LMAP-based measurement system

   Figure 1 shows the main components of a measurement system, and the
   interactions of those components.  Some of the components are outside
   the scope of initial LMAP work.  In this section we provide an
   overview of the whole measurement system and we introduce the main
   terms needed for the LMAP framework.  The new terms are capitalised.
   In the next section we provide a terminology section with a
   compilation of all the LMAP terms and their definition.  Section 4
   onwards considers the LMAP components in more detail.

   Other LMAP specifications will define an information model, the
   associated data models, and select/extend one or more protocols for
   the secure communication: firstly, a Control Protocol, from a
   Controller to instruct Measurement Agents what performance metrics to
   measure, when to measure them, how/when to report the measurement
   results to a Collector; secondly, a Report Protocol, for a
   Measurement Agent to report the results to the Collector.

   The MA performs Measurement Tasks.  The MAs are pieces of code that
   can be executed in specialised hardware (hardware probe) or on a
   general-purpose device (like a PC or mobile phone).  The MA may
   generate Measurement Traffic and measure some metric associated with
   its transfer, or the MA may observe existing traffic, or there may be
   some kind of hybrid of these two possibilities.  A device with a
   Measurement Agent may have multiple interfaces (WiFi, Ethernet, DSL,
   fibre; and non-physical interfaces such as PPPoE or IPsec) and the
   Measurement Tasks may specify any one of these.

   The Controller manages a MA through use of the Control Protocol,
   which transfer the Instruction to the MA.  This describes the
   Measurement Tasks the MA should perform and when.  For example the
   Controller may instruct a MA at a home gateway: "Count the number of
   TCP SYN packets observed in a 1 minute interval; repeat every hour at
   xx.05 + Unif[0,180] seconds".  The Measurement Schedule determines
   when the Measurement Tasks are executed.  The Controller also manages
   a MA by instructing it how to report the Measurement Results, for



Eardley, et al.         Expires December 15, 2014               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft               LMAP Framework                    June 2014


   example: "Report results once a day in a batch at 4am + Unif[0,180]
   seconds; if the end user is active then delay the report 5 minutes".
   The Report Schedule determines when the Reports are uploaded to the
   Collector.  The Measurement Schedule and Report Schedule can define
   one-off (non-recurring) actions ("Do measurement now", "Report as
   soon as possible"), as well as recurring ones.

   The Collector accepts a Report from a MA with the Measurement Results
   from its Measurement Tasks.  It then provides the Results to a
   repository (see below).

   A Measurement Method defines how to measure a Metric of interest.  It
   is very useful to standardise Measurement Methods, so that it is
   meaningful to compare measurements of the same Metric made at
   different times and places.  It is also useful to define a registry
   for commonly-used Metrics [I-D.manyfolks-ippm-metric-registry] so
   that a Metric with its associated Measurement Method can be referred
   to simply by its identifier in the registry.  The Measurement Methods
   and registry will hopefully be referenced by other standards
   organisations.

   Broadly speaking there are two types of Measurement Method.  It may
   involve a single MA simply observing existing traffic - for example,
   the Measurement Agent could count bytes or calculate the average loss
   for a particular flow.  On the other hand, a Measurement Method may
   involve multiple network entities, which perform different roles.
   For example, a "ping" Measurement Method, to measure the round trip
   delay , would consist of an MA sending an ICMP ECHO request to a
   responder in the Internet.  In LMAP terms, the responder is termed a
   Measurement Peer (MP), meaning that it helps the MA but is not
   managed by the Controller.  Other Measurement Methods involve a
   second MA, with the Controller instructing the MAs in a coordinated
   manner.  Traffic generated specifically as part of the Measurement
   Method is termed Measurement Traffic; in the ping example, it is the
   ICMP ECHO Requests and Replies.  The protocols used for the
   Measurement Traffic are out of the scope of initial LMAP work, and
   fall within the scope of other IETF WGs such as IPPM.  The
   Appendix has some other examples of possible arrangements of
   Measurement Agents and Peers.

   A Measurement Task is the action performed by a particular MA at a
   particular time, as the specific instance of its role in a
   Measurement Method.  LMAP is mainly concerned with Measurement Tasks,
   for instance in terms of its Information Model and Protocols.

   For Measurement Results to be truly comparable, as might be required
   by a regulator, not only do the same Measurement Methods need to be
   used to assess Metrics, but also the set of Measurement Tasks should

Internet-Draft               LMAP Framework                    June 2014


   follow a similar Measurement Schedule and be of similar number.  The
   details of such a characterisation plan are beyond the scope of work
   in IETF although certainly facilitated by IETF's work.

   Messages are transferred over a secure Channel.  A Control Channel is
   between the Controller and a MA; the Control Protocol delivers
   Instruction Messages to the MA and Capabilities, Failure and Logging
   Information in the reverse direction.  A Report Channel is between a
   MA and Collector, and the Report Protocol delivers Reports to the
   Collector.

   Finally we introduce several components that are outside the scope of
   initial LMAP work and will be provided through existing protocols or
   applications.  They affect how the measurement system uses the
   Measurement Results and how it decides what set of Measurement Tasks
   to perform.

   The MA needs to be bootstrapped with initial details about its
   Controller, including authentication credentials.  The LMAP work
   considers the bootstrap process, since it affects the Information
   Model.  However, LMAP does not define a bootstrap protocol, since it
   is likely to be technology specific and could be defined by the
   Broadband Forum, CableLabs or IEEE depending on the device.  Possible
   protocols are SNMP, NETCONF or (for Home Gateways) CPE WAN Management
   Protocol (CWMP) from the Auto Configuration Server (ACS) (as
   specified in TR-069 [TR-069]).

   A Subscriber parameter database contains information about the line,
   such as the customer's broadband contract (perhaps 2, 40 or 80Mb/s),
   the line technology (DSL or fibre), the time zone where the MA is
   located, and the type of home gateway and MA.  These parameters are
   already gathered and stored by existing operations systems.  They may
   affect the choice of what Measurement Tasks to run and how to
   interpret the Measurement Results.  For example, a download test
   suitable for a line with an 80Mb/s contract may overwhelm a 2Mb/s
   line.

   A results repository records all Measurement Results in an equivalent
   form, for example an SQL database, so that they can easily be
   accessed by the data analysis tools.

   The data analysis tools receive the results from the Collector or via
   the Results repository.  They might visualise the data or identify
   which component or link is likely to be the cause of a fault or
   degradation.  This information could help the Controller decide what
   follow-up Measurement Task to perform in order to diagnose a fault.
   The data analysis tools also need to understand the Subscriber's
   service information, for example the broadband contract.

3.  Terminology

   This section defines terminology for LMAP.  Please note that defined
   terms are capitalized.

   Bootstrap: A process that integrates a Measurement Agent into a
   measurement system.

   Capabilities: Information about the performance measurement
   capabilities of the MA, in particular the Measurement Method roles
   and measurement protocol roles that it can perform, and the device
   hosting the MA, for example its interface type and speed, but not
   dynamic information.

Internet-Draft               LMAP Framework                    June 2014


   Channel: A bi-directional logical connection that is defined by a
   specific Controller and MA, or Collector and MA, plus associated
   security.

   Collector: A function that receives a Report from a Measurement
   Agent.

   Controller: A function that provides a Measurement Agent with its
   Instruction.

   Control Channel: a Channel between a Controller and a MA over which
   Instruction Messages and Capabilities, Failure and Logging
   Information are sent.

   Control Protocol: The protocol delivering Instruction(s) from a
   Controller to a Measurement Agent.  It also delivers Capabilities,
   Failure and Logging Information from the Measurement Agent to the
   Controller.

   Cycle-ID: A tag that is sent by the Controller in an Instruction and
   echoed by the MA in its Report.  The same Cycle-ID is used by several
   MAs that use the same Measurement Method for a Metric with the same
   Input Parameters.  Hence the Cycle-ID allows the Collector to easily
   identify Measurement Results that should be comparable.

   Data Model: The implementation of an Information Model in a
   particular data modelling language [RFC3444].

   Environmental Constraint: A parameter that is measured as part of the
   Measurement Task, its value determining whether the rest of the
   Measurement Task proceeds.

   Failure Information: Information about the MA's failure to action or
   execute an Instruction, whether concerning Measurement Tasks or
   Reporting.

   Group-ID: An identifier of a group of MAs.

   Information Model: The protocol-neutral definition of the semantics
   of the Instructions, the Report, the status of the different elements
   of the measurement system as well of the events in the system
   [RFC3444].

   Input Parameter: A parameter whose value is left open by the Metric
   and its Measurement Method and is set to a specific value in a
   Measurement Task.  Altering the value of an Input Parameter does not
   change the fundamental nature of the Measurement Task.

   Instruction: The description of Measurement Tasks for a MA to perform
   and the details of the Report for it to send.  It is the collective
   description of the Measurement Task configurations, the configuration
   of the Measurement Schedules, the configuration of the Report
   Channel(s), the configuration of Report Schedule(s), and the details
   of any suppression.

   Instruction Message: The message that carries an Instruction from a
   Controller to a Measurement Agent.

   Logging Information: Information about the operation of the
   Measurement Agent and which may be useful for debugging.

   Measurement Agent (MA): The function that receives Instruction
   Messages from a Controller and operates the Instruction by executing
   Measurement Tasks (using protocols outside the initial LMAP work
   scope and perhaps in concert with one or more other Measurement
   Agents or Measurement Peers) and (if part of the Instruction) by
   reporting Measurement Results to a Collector or Collectors.

   Measurement Agent Identifier (MA-ID): a UUID [RFC4122] that
   identifies a particular MA and is configured as part of the
   Bootstrapping process.

   Measurement Method: The process for assessing the value of a Metric;
   the process of measuring some performance or reliability parameter
   associated with the transfer of traffic; where this process involves
   multiple MAs or MPs, each may perform different roles.

   Measurement Peer (MP): The function that assists a Measurement Agent
   with Measurement Tasks and does not have an interface to the
   Controller or Collector.

   Measurement Result: The output of a single Measurement Task (the
   value obtained for the parameter of interest or Metric).

   Measurement Schedule: The schedule for performing Measurement Tasks.

   Measurement Task: The action performed by a particular Measurement
   Agent that consists of the single assessment of a Metric through
   operation of a Measurement Method role at a particular time, with all
   of the role's Input Parameters set to specific values.

   Measurement Traffic: the packet(s) generated by some types of
   Measurement Method that involve measuring some parameter associated
   with the transfer of the packet(s).

   Metric: The quantity related to the performance and reliability of
   the network that we'd like to know the value of, and that is
   carefully specified.

   Report: The set of Measurement Results and other associated
   information (as defined by the Instruction).  The Report is sent by a
   Measurement Agent to a Collector.

   Report Channel: a communications channel between a MA and a
   Collector, which is defined by a specific MA, Collector, Report
   Schedule and associated security, and over which Reports are sent.

   Report Protocol: The protocol delivering Report(s) from a Measurement
   Agent to a Collector.

   Report Schedule: the schedule for sending Reports to a Collector.

   Subscriber: An entity (associated with one or more users) that is
   engaged in a subscription with a service provider.

   Suppression: the temporary cessation of Measurement Tasks.

4.  Constraints

   The LMAP framework makes some important assumptions, which constrain
   the scope of the initial LMAP work.

4.1.  Measurement system is under the direction of a single organisation

   In the LMAP framework, the measurement system is under the direction
   of a single organisation that is responsible for any impact that its
   measurements have on a user's quality of experience and privacy.
   Clear responsibility is critical given that a misbehaving large-scale
   measurement system could potentially harm user experience, user
   privacy and network security.

   However, the components of an LMAP measurement system can be deployed
   in administrative domains that are not owned by the measuring
   organisation.  Thus, the system of functions deployed by a single
   organisation constitutes a single LMAP domain which may span
   ownership or other administrative boundaries.

4.2.  Each MA may only have a single Controller at any point in time

   A MA is instructed by one Controller and is in one measurement
   system.  The constraint avoids different Controllers giving a MA
   conflicting instructions and so means that the MA does not have to
   manage contention between multiple Measurement (or Report) Schedules.



Eardley, et al.         Expires December 15, 2014              [Page 11]

Internet-Draft               LMAP Framework                    June 2014


   This simplifies the design of MAs (critical for a large-scale
   infrastructure) and allows a Measurement Schedule to be tested on
   specific types of MA before deployment to ensure that the end user
   experience is not impacted (due to CPU, memory or broadband-product
   constraints).

   An operator may have several Controllers, perhaps with a Controller
   for different types of MA (home gateways, tablets) or location
   (Ipswich, Edinburgh).

5.  LMAP Protocol Model

   A protocol model [RFC4101] presents an architectural model for how
   the protocol operates and needs to answer three basic questions:

   1.  What problem is the protocol trying to achieve?

   2.  What messages are being transmitted and what do they mean?

   3.  What are the important, but unobvious, features of the protocol?

   An LMAP system goes through the following phases:

   o  a bootstrapping process before the MA can take part in the other
      three phases

   o  a Control Protocol, which delivers Instruction Messages from a
      Controller to a MA, detailing what Measurement Tasks the MA should
      perform and when, and how it should report the Measurement
      Results.  It also delivers Capabilities, Failure and logging
      Information from a MA to its Controller.  Finally, it allows the
      Controller to update the MA's configuration.

   o  the actual Measurement Tasks, which measure some performance or
      reliability parameter(s) associated with the transfer of packets.
      The LMAP work does not define Metrics and Measurement Methods,
      these are define elsewhere (e.g.  IPPM).

   o  a Report Protocol, which delivers Reports from a MA to a
      Collector.  The Report contains the Measurement Results.

   The diagrams show the various LMAP messages and uses the following
   convention:

   o  (optional): indicated by round brackets

   o  [potentially repeated]: indicated by square brackets




Eardley, et al.         Expires December 15, 2014              [Page 12]

Internet-Draft               LMAP Framework                    June 2014


   The protocol model is closely related to the Information Model
   [I-D.ietf-lmap-information-model], which is the abstract definition
   of the information carried by the protocol model.  The purpose of
   both is to provide a protocol and device independent view, which can
   be implemented via specific protocols.  LMAP defines a specific
   Control Protocol and Report Protocol, but others could be defined by
   other standards bodies or be proprietary.  However it is important
   that they all implement the same Information Model and protocol
   model, in order to ease the definition, operation and
   interoperability of large-scale measurement systems.

5.1.  Bootstrapping process

   The primary purpose of bootstrapping is to enable a MA to be
   integrated into a measurement system.  The MA retrieves information
   about itself (like its identity in the measurement system) and about
   the Controller, the Controller learns information about the MA, and
   they learn about security information to communicate (such as
   certificates and credentials).

   Whilst this memo considers the bootstrapping process, it is beyond
   the scope of initial LMAP work to define a bootstrap mechanism, as it
   depends on the type of device and access.

   As a result of the bootstrapping process the MA learns information
   with the following aims ([I-D.ietf-lmap-information-model] defines
   the consequent list of information elements):

   o  its identifier, either its MA-ID or a device identifier such as
      its MAC

   o  (optionally) a Group-ID.  A Group-ID would be shared by several
      MAs and could be useful for privacy reasons.  For instance,
      reporting the Group-ID and not the MA-ID could hinder tracking of
      a mobile device

   o  the Control Channel, which is defined by:

      *  the address which identifies the Control Channel, such as the
         Controller's FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) [RFC1035])

      *  security information (for example to enable the MA to decrypt
         the Instruction Message and encrypt messages sent to the
         Controller)

   The details of the bootstrapping process are device /access specific.
   For example, the information could be in the firmware, manually
   configured or transferred via a protocol like TR-069 [TR-069].  There



Eardley, et al.         Expires December 15, 2014              [Page 13]

Internet-Draft               LMAP Framework                    June 2014


   may be a multi-stage process where the MA contacts the device at a
   'hard-coded' address, which replies with the bootstrapping
   information.

   The MA must learn its MA-ID before getting an Instruction, either
   during Bootstrapping or via configuration (Section 5.2.1).

5.2.  Control Protocol

   The primary purpose of the Control Protocol is to allow the
   Controller to configure a Measurement Agent with an Instruction about
   what Measurement Tasks to do, when to do them, and how to report the
   Measurement Results (Section 5.2.2).  The Measurement Agent then acts
   on the Instruction autonomously.  The Control Protocol also enables
   the MA to inform the Controller about its Capabilities and any
   Failure and logging Information (Section 5.2.2).  Finally, the
   Control Protocol allows the Controller to update the MA's
   configuration.

5.2.1.  Configuration

   Configuration allows the Controller to update the MA about some or
   all of the information that it obtained during the bootstrapping
   process: the MA-ID, the (optional) Group-ID and the Control Channel.
   The measurement system might use Configuration for several reasons.
   For example, the bootstrapping process could 'hard code' the MA with
   details of an initial Controller, and then the initial Controller
   could configure the MA with details about the Controller that sends
   Instruction Messages.  (Note that a MA only has one Control Channel,
   and so is associated with only one Controller, at any moment.)

   Note that an implementation may choose to combine Configuration
   information and an Instruction Message into a single message.

5.2.2.  Instruction

   The Instruction is the description of the Measurement Tasks for a
   Measurement Agent to do and the details of the Measurement Reports
   for it to send.  In order to update the Instruction the Controller
   uses the Control Protocol to send an Instruction Message over the
   Control Channel.

|                 |                                      | Measurement |

+-----------------+                                      +-------------+

Instruction:                            ->
[(Measurement Task configuration(
   [Input Parameter],
   (interface),
   (Cycle-ID))),
 (Report Channel),

 (Suppression information)]
                                         <-          Response(details)


   The Instruction defines information with the following aims
   ([I-D.ietf-lmap-information-model] defines the consequent list of
   information elements):

   o  the Measurement Task configurations, each of which needs:

      *  the Metric, specified as a URI to a registry entry; it includes
         the specification of a Measurement Method.  The registry could
         be defined by the IETF [I-D.manyfolks-ippm-metric-registry],
         locally by the operator of the measurement system or perhaps by
         another standards organisation.

      *  the Measurement Method role.  For some Measurement Methods,
         different parties play different roles; for example (figure A3
         in the Appendix) an iperf sender and receiver.  Each Metric and
         its associated Measurement Method will describe all measurement
         roles involved in the process.  Thus, the Measurement Method
         role is an Input Parameter.

      *  a boolean flag (supppress or do-not-suppress) indicating how
         such a Measurement Task is impacted by a Suppression message
         (see Section 5.2.2.1).  Thus, the flag is an Input Parameter.

Internet-Draft               LMAP Framework                    June 2014


      *  any Input Parameters that need to be set for the Metric and the
         Measurement Method, such as the address of a Measurement Peer
         (or other Measurement Agent) that may be involved in a
         Measurement Task, and for the measurement protocol used, such
         as protocol role(s).

      *  if the device with the MA has multiple interfaces, then the
         interface to use (if not defined, then the default interface is
         used)

   o  configuration of the Measurement Schedules, each of which needs:

      *  the timing of when the Measurement Tasks are to be performed.
         Possible types of timing are periodic, calendar-based periodic,
         one-off immediate and one-off at a future time

   o  configuration of the Report Channels, each of which needs:

      *  the address of the Collector, for instance its URL

      *  security for this Report Channel, for example the X.509
         certificate

   o  configuration of the Report Schedules, each of which needs:

      *  the timing of when reporting is to be performed.  For instance,
         every hour or immediately.

   o  Suppression information, if any (see Section 5.2.1.1)

   A single Instruction Message may contain some or all of the above
   parts.  The finest level of granularity possible in an Instruction
   Message is determined by the implementation and operation of the
   Control Protocol.  For example, a single Instruction Message may add
   or update an individual Measurement Schedule - or it may only update
   the complete set of Measurement Schedules; a single Instruction
   Message may update both Measurement Schedules and Measurement Task
   configurations - or only one at a time; and so on.

   The MA informs the Controller that it has successfully understood the
   Instruction Message, or that it cannot action the Instruction - for
   example, if it doesn't include a parameter that is mandatory for the
   requested Metric and Measurement Method, or it is missing details of
   the target Collector.

   The Instruction Message instructs the MA; the Control Protocol does
   not allow the MA to negotiate, as this would add complexity to the
   MA, Controller and Control Protocol for little benefit.

5.2.2.1.  Suppression

   The Instruction may include Suppression information.  The purpose of
   Suppression is to enable the Controller to instruct the MA not to
   perform Measurement Tasks.  It is used if the measurement system
   wants to eliminate inessential traffic, because there is some
   unexpected network issue for example.

   The Suppression information may include any of the following optional
   fields:

   o  a set of Measurement Tasks to suppress; the others are not
      suppressed.  For example, this could be useful if a particular
      Measurement Task is overloading a Measurement Peer.

   o  a set of Measurement Schedules to suppress; the others are not
      suppressed.  For example, suppose the measurement system has
      defined two Schedules, one with the most critical Measurement
      Tasks and the other with less critical ones that create a lot of
      Active Measurement Traffic, then it may only want to suppress the
      second.

   o  if the Suppression information includes neither a set of
      Measurement Tasks nor a set of Measurement Schedules, then the MA
      does not begin new Measurement Tasks that have the boolean flag
      set to "suppress"; however, the MA does begin new Measurement
      Tasks that have the flag set to "do-not-suppress".

   o  a start time, at which suppression begins.  If absent, then
      Suppression begins immediately.

   o  an end time, at which suppression ends.  If absent, then
      Suppression continues until the MA receives an un-Suppress
      message.

   o  a demand that the MA ends its on-going Active Measurement Task(s)
      immediately (and deletes the associated partial Measurement
      Result(s)).  If absent, the MA completes on-going Measurement
      Tasks.

   So the default action (if none of the optional fields is set) is that
   the MA does not begin any new Measurement Task with the "suppress"
   flag.

   An un-Suppress message instructs the MA no longer to suppress,
   meaning that the MA once again begins new Measurement Tasks,
   according to its Measurement Schedule.

Internet-Draft               LMAP Framework                    June 2014


   Note that Suppression is not intended to permanently stop a
   Measurement Task (instead, the Controller should send a new
   Measurement Schedule), nor to permanently disable a MA (instead, some
   kind of management action is suggested).

5.2.3.  Capabilities and Failure information

   The Control Protocol also enables the MA to inform the Controller
   about various information, such as its Capabilities and any Failures.
   It is also possible to use a device-specific mechanism which is
   beyond the scope of the initial LMAP work.

   Capabilities are information about the MA that the Controller needs
   to know in order to correctly instruct the MA, such as:

   o  the Measurement Method (roles) that the MA supports

   o  the measurement protocol types and roles that the MA supports

   o  the interfaces that the MA has

   o  the version of the MA

   o  the version of the hardware, firmware or software of the device
      with the MA

   o  but not dynamic information like the currently unused CPU, memory
      or battery life of the device with the MA.

   Failure information concerns why the MA has been unable to execute a
   Measurement Task or deliver a Report, for example:





Eardley, et al.         Expires December 15, 2014              [Page 18]

Internet-Draft               LMAP Framework                    June 2014


   o  the Measurement Task failed to run properly because the MA
      (unexpectedly) has no spare CPU cycles

   o  the MA failed record the Measurement Results because it
      (unexpectedly) is out of spare memory

   o  a Report failed to deliver Measurement Results because the
      Collector (unexpectedly) is not responding

   o  but not if a Measurement Task correctly doesn't start.  For
      example, the first step of some Measurement Methods is for the MA
      to check there is no cross-traffic.

   Logging information concerns how the MA is operating and may help
   debugging, for example:

   o  the last time the MA ran a Measurement Task

   o  the last time the MA sent a Measurement Report

   o  the last time the MA received an Instruction Message

   o  whether the MA is currently Suppressing Measurement Tasks

   Capabilities, failure and logging information are sent by the MA,
   either in response to a request from the Controller (for example, if
   the Controller forgets what the MA can do or otherwise wants to
   resynchronize what it knows about the MA), or on its own initiative
   (for example when the MA first communicates with a Controller or if
   it becomes capable of a new Measurement Method).  Another example of
   the latter case is if the device with the MA re-boots, then the MA
   should notify its Controller in case its Instruction needs to be
   updated; to avoid a "mass calling event" after a widespread power
   restoration affecting many MAs, it is sensible for an MA to pause for
   a random delay, perhaps in the range of one minute or so.

5.3.  Operation of Measurement Tasks

   This LMAP framework is neutral to what the actual Measurement Task
   is.  It does not define Metrics and Measurement Methods, these are
   defined elsewhere (e.g.  IPPM).

   The MA carries out the Measurement Tasks as instructed, unless it
   gets an updated Instruction.  The MA acts autonomously, in terms of
   operation of the Measurement Tasks and reporting of the Results; it
   doesn't do a 'safety check' with the Controller to ask whether it
   should still continue with the requested Measurement Tasks.

5.3.1.  Starting and Stopping Measurement Tasks

   This LMAP framework does not define a generic start and stop process,
   since the correct approach depends on the particular Measurement
   Task; the details are defined as part of each Measurement Method.
   This section provides some general hints.  The MA does not inform the
   Controller about Measurement Tasks starting and stopping.

   Before sending Measurement Traffic the MA may run a pre-check.  (The
   pre-check could be defined as a separate, preceding Task or as the
   first part of a larger Task.)  Action could include:

   o  the MA checking that there is no cross-traffic.  In other words, a
      check that the end-user isn't already sending traffic;

   o  the MA checking with the Measurement Peer (or other Measurement
      Agent involved in the Measurement Task) that it can handle a new
      Measurement Task (in case, for example, the Measurement Peer is
      already handling many Measurement Tasks with other MAs);

   o  sending traffic that probes the path to check it isn't overloaded;




Eardley, et al.         Expires December 15, 2014              [Page 20]

Internet-Draft               LMAP Framework                    June 2014


   o  checking that the device with the MA has enough resources to
      execute the Measurement Task reliably.  Note that the designer of
      the measurement system should ensure that the device's
      capabilities are normally sufficient to comfortably operate the
      Measurement Tasks.

   It is possible that similar checks continue during the Measurement
   Task, especially one that is long-running and/or creates a lot of
   Measurement Traffic, and might lead to it being abandoned whilst in-
   progress.  A Measurement Task could also be abandoned in response to
   a "suppress" message (see Section 5.2.1).  Action could include:

   o  For 'upload' tests, the MA not sending traffic

   o  For 'download' tests, the MA closing the TCP connection or sending
      a TWAMP Stop control message [RFC5357].

   The Controller may want a MA to run the same Measurement Task
   indefinitely (for example, "run the 'upload speed' Measurement Task
   once an hour until further notice").  To avoid the MA generating
   traffic forever after a Controller has permanently failed (or
   communications with the Controller have failed), the MA can be
   configured with a time limit; if the MA doesn't hear from the
   Controller for this length of time, then it stops operating
   Measurement Tasks.

5.3.2.  Overlapping Measurement Tasks

   It is possible that a MA starts a new Measurement Task before another
   Measurement Task has completed.  This may be intentional (the way
   that the measurement system has designed the Measurement Schedules),
   but it could also be unintentional - for instance, if a Measurement
   Task has a 'wait for X' step which pauses for an unexpectedly long
   time.  The operator of the measurement system can handle (or not)
   overlapping Measurement Tasks in any way they choose - it is a policy
   or implementation issue and not the concern of LMAP.  Some possible
   approaches are: to configure the MA not to begin the second
   Measurement Task; to start the second Measurement Task as usual; for
   the action to be an Input Parameter of the Measurement Task; and so
   on.

   It may be important to include in the Measurement Report the fact
   that the Measurement Task overlapped with another.

5.4.  Report Protocol

   The primary purpose of the Report Protocol is to allow a Measurement
   Agent to report its Measurement Results to a Collector, along with
   the context in which they were obtained.

 +-----------------+                                   +-------------+
 |                 |                                   | Measurement |
 |   Collector     |===================================|  Agent      |
 +-----------------+                                   +-------------+

                                    <-    Report:
                                                  [MA-ID &/or Group-ID],
                                                   [Measurement Result],
                                           [details of Measurement Task]
 ACK                                ->


   The Report contains:

   o  the MA-ID or a Group-ID (to anonymise results)

   o  the actual Measurement Results, including the time they were
      measured

   o  the details of the Measurement Task (to avoid the Collector having
      to ask the Controller for this information later)

   o  perhaps the Subscriber's service parameters (see Section 5.4.1).

   The MA sends Reports as defined by the Instruction.  It is possible
   that the Instruction tells the MA to report the same Results to more
   than one Collector, or to report a different subset of Results to
   different Collectors.  It is also possible that a Measurement Task
   may create two (or more) Measurement Results, which could be reported
   differently (for example, one Result could be reported periodically,
   whilst the second Result could be an alarm that is created as soon as
   the measured value of the Metric crosses a threshold and that is
   reported immediately).

   Optionally, a Report is not sent when there are no Measurement
   Results.

   In the initial LMAP Information Model and Report Protocol, for
   simplicity we assume that all Measurement Results are reported as-is,
   but allow extensibility so that a measurement system (or perhaps a
   second phase of LMAP) could allow a MA to:




Eardley, et al.         Expires December 15, 2014              [Page 22]

Internet-Draft               LMAP Framework                    June 2014


   o  label, or perhaps not include, Measurement Results impacted by,
      for instance, cross-traffic or the Measurement Peer (or other
      Measurement Agent) being busy

   o  label Measurement Results obtained by a Measurement Task that
      overlapped with another

   o  not report the Measurement Results if the MA believes that they
      are invalid

   o  detail when Suppression started and ended

5.4.1.  Reporting of Subscriber's service parameters

   The Subscriber's service parameters are information about his/her
   broadband contract, line rate and so on.  Such information is likely
   to be needed to help analyse the Measurement Results, for example to
   help decide whether the measured download speed is reasonable.

   The information could be transferred directly from the Subscriber
   parameter database to the data analysis tools.  It may also be
   possible to transfer the information via the MA.  How (and if) the MA
   knows such information is likely to depend on the device type.  The
   MA could either include the information in a Measurement Report or
   separately.

5.5.  Operation of LMAP over the underlying packet transfer mechanism

   The above sections have described LMAP's protocol model.  Other
   specifications will define the actual Control and Report Protocols,
   possibly operating over an existing protocol, to be selected, for
   example REST-style HTTP(S).  It is also possible that a different
   choice is made for the Control and Report Protocols, for example
   NETCONF-YANG and IPFIX respectively.

   From an LMAP perspective, the Controller needs to know that the MA
   has received the Instruction Message, or at least that it needs to be
   re-sent as it may have failed to be delivered.  Similarly the MA
   needs to know about the delivery of Capabilities and Failure
   information to the Controller and Reports to the Collector.  How this
   is done depends on the design of the Control and Report Protocols and
   the underlying packet transfer mechanism.

   For the Control Protocol, the underlying packet transfer mechanism
   could be:

   o  a 'push' protocol (that is, from the Controller to the MA)




Eardley, et al.         Expires December 15, 2014              [Page 23]

Internet-Draft               LMAP Framework                    June 2014


   o  a multicast protocol (from the Controller to a group of MAs)

   o  a 'pull' protocol.  The MA periodically checks with Controller if
      the Instruction has changed and pulls a new Instruction if
      necessary.  A pull protocol seems attractive for a MA behind a NAT
      (as is typical for a MA on an end-user's device), so that it can
      initiate the communications.  A pull mechanism is likely to
      require the MA to be configured with how frequently it should
      check in with the Controller, and perhaps what it should do if the
      Controller is unreachable after a certain number of attempts.

   o  a hybrid protocol.  In addition to a pull protocol, the Controller
      can also push an alert to the MA that it should immediately pull a
      new Instruction.

   For the Report Protocol, the underlying packet transfer mechanism
   could be:

   o  a 'push' protocol (that is, from the MA to the Collector)

   o  perhaps supplemented by the ability for the Collector to 'pull'
      Measurement Results from a MA.

5.6.  Items beyond the scope of the initial LMAP work

   There are several potential interactions between LMAP elements that
   are beyond the scope of the initial LMAP work:

   1.  It does not define a coordination process between MAs.  Whilst a
       measurement system may define coordinated Measurement Schedules
       across its various MAs, there is no direct coordination between
       MAs.

   2.  It does not define interactions between the Collector and
       Controller.  It is quite likely that there will be such
       interactions, optionally intermediated by the data analysis
       tools.  For example, if there is an "interesting" Measurement
       Result then the measurement system may want to trigger extra
       Measurement Tasks that explore the potential cause in more
       detail; or if the Collector unexpectedly does not hear from a MA,
       then the measurement system may want to trigger the Controller to
       send a fresh Instruction Message to the MA.

   3.  It does not define coordination between different measurement
       systems.  For example, it does not define the interaction of a MA
       in one measurement system with a Controller or Collector in a
       different measurement system.  Whilst it is likely that the
       Control and Report Protocols could be re-used or adapted for this



Eardley, et al.         Expires December 15, 2014              [Page 24]

Internet-Draft               LMAP Framework                    June 2014


       scenario, any form of coordination between different
       organisations involves difficult commercial and technical issues
       and so, given the novelty of large-scale measurement efforts, any
       form of inter-organisation coordination is outside the scope of
       the initial LMAP work.  Note that a single MA is instructed by a
       single Controller and is only in one measurement system.

       *  An interesting scenario is where a home contains two
          independent MAs, for example one controlled by a regulator and
          one controlled by an ISP.  Then the Measurement Traffic of one
          MA is treated by the other MA just like any other end-user
          traffic.

   4.  It does not consider how to prevent a malicious party "gaming the
       system".  For example, where a regulator is running a measurement
       system in order to benchmark operators, a malicious operator
       could try to identify the broadband lines that the regulator was
       measuring and prioritise that traffic.  It is assumed this is a
       policy issue and would be dealt with through a code of conduct
       for instance.

   5.  It does not define how to analyse Measurement Results, including
       how to interpret missing Results.

   6.  It does not specifically define a end-user-controlled measurement
       system, see sub-section 5.6.1.

5.6.1.  End-user-controlled measurement system

   This framework concentrates on the cases where an ISP or a regulator
   runs the measurement system.  However, we expect that LMAP
   functionality will also be used in the context of an end-user-
   controlled measurement system.  There are at least two ways this
   could happen (they have various pros and cons):

   1.  an end-user could somehow request the ISP- (or regulator-) run
       measurement system to test his/her line.  The ISP (or regulator)
       Controller would then send an Instruction to the MA in the usual
       LMAP way.  Note that a user can't directly initiate a Measurement
       Task on an ISP- (or regulator-) controlled MA.

   2.  an end-user could deploy their own measurement system, with their
       own MA, Controller and Collector.  For example, the user could
       implement all three functions onto the same end-user-owned end
       device, perhaps by downloading the functions from the ISP or
       regulator.  Then the LMAP Control and Report Protocols do not
       need to be used, but using LMAP's Information Model would still
       be beneficial.  The Measurement Peer (or other MA involved in the



Eardley, et al.         Expires December 15, 2014              [Page 25]

Internet-Draft               LMAP Framework                    June 2014


       Measurement Task) could be in the home gateway or outside the
       home network; in the latter case the Measurement Peer is highly
       likely to be run by a different organisation, which raises extra
       privacy considerations.

   In both cases there will be some way for the end-user to initiate the
   Measurement Task(s).  The mechanism is outside the scope of the
   initial LMAP work, but could include the user clicking a button on a
   GUI or sending a text message.  Presumably the user will also be able
   to see the Measurement Results, perhaps summarised on a webpage.  It
   is suggested that these interfaces conform to the LMAP guidance on
   privacy in Section 8.

6.  Deployment considerations

   The Appendix has some examples of possible deployment arrangements of
   Measurement Agents and Peers.

6.1.  Controller and the measurement system

   The Controller should understand both the MA's LMAP Capabilities (for
   instance what Metrics and Measurement Methods it can perform) and
   about the MA's other capabilities like processing power and memory.
   This allows the Controller to make sure that the Measurement Schedule
   of Measurement Tasks and the Reporting Schedule are sensible for each
   MA that it Instructs.

   An Instruction is likely to include several Measurement Tasks.
   Typically these run at different times, but it is also possible for
   them to run at the same time.  Some Tasks may be compatible, in that
   they do not affect each other's Results, whilst with others great
   care would need to be taken.

   The Controller should ensure that the Measurement Tasks do not have
   an adverse effect on the end user.  Tasks, especially those that
   generate a substantial amount of traffic, will often include a pre-
   check that the user isn't already sending traffic (Section 5.3).
   Another consideration is whether Measurement Traffic will impact a
   Subscriber's bill or traffic cap.

   The different elements of the Instruction can be updated
   independently.  For example, the Measurement Tasks could be
   configured with different Input Parameters whilst keeping the same
   Measurement Schedule.  In general this should not create any issues,
   since Metrics and their associated Measurement Methods should be
   defined so their fundamental nature does not change for a new value
   of Input Parameter.  There could be a problem if, for example, a




Eardley, et al.         Expires December 15, 2014              [Page 26]

Internet-Draft               LMAP Framework                    June 2014


   Measurement Task involving a 1kB file upload could be changed into a
   1GB file upload.

   A measurement system may have multiple Controllers (but note the
   overriding principle that a single MA is instructed by a single
   Controller at any point in time (Section 4.2)).  For example, there
   could be different Controllers for different types of MA (home
   gateways, tablets) or locations (Ipswich, Edinburgh), for load
   balancing or to cope with failure of one Controller.

   The measurement system also needs to consider carefully how to
   interpret missing Results; for example, if the missing Results are
   ignored and the lack of a Report is caused by its broadband being
   broken, then the estimate of overall performance, averaged across all
   MAs, would be too optimistic.

6.2.  Measurement Agent

   The Measurement Agent could take a number of forms: a dedicated
   probe, software on a PC, embedded into an appliance, or even embedded
   into a gateway.  A single site (home, branch office etc.) that is
   participating in a measurement could make use of one or multiple
   Measurement Agents or Measurement Peers in a single measurement.

   The Measurement Agent could be deployed in a variety of locations.
   Not all deployment locations are available to every kind of
   Measurement Agent.  There are also a variety of limitations and
   trade-offs depending on the final placement.  The next sections
   outline some of the locations a Measurement Agent may be deployed.
   This is not an exhaustive list and combinations may also apply.

6.2.1.  Measurement Agent on a networked device

   A MA may be embedded on a device that is directly connected to the
   network, such as a MA on a smartphone.  Other examples include a MA
   downloaded and installed on a subscriber's laptop computer or tablet
   when the network service is provided on wired or other wireless radio
   technologies, such as Wi-Fi.

6.2.2.  Measurement Agent embedded in site gateway

   A Measurement Agent embedded with the site gateway, for example a
   home router or the edge router of a branch office in a managed
   service environment, is one of better places the Measurement Agent
   could be deployed.  All site-to-ISP traffic would traverse through
   the gateway.  So, Measurement Methods that measure user traffic could
   easily be performed.  Similarly, due to this user traffic visibility,
   a Measurement Method that generates Measurement Traffic could ensure



Eardley, et al.         Expires December 15, 2014              [Page 27]

Internet-Draft               LMAP Framework                    June 2014


   it does not compete with user traffic.  Generally NAT and firewall
   services are built into the gateway, allowing the Measurement Agent
   the option to offer its Controller-facing management interface
   outside of the NAT/firewall.  This placement of the management
   interface allows the Controller to unilaterally contact the
   Measurement Agent for instructions.  However, a Measurement Agent on
   a site gateway (whether end-user service-provider owned) will
   generally not be directly available for over the top providers, the
   regulator, end users or enterprises.

6.2.3.  Measurement Agent embedded behind site NAT /Firewall

   The Measurement Agent could also be embedded behind a NAT, a
   firewall, or both.  In this case the Controller may not be able to
   unilaterally contact the Measurement Agent unless either static port
   forwarding or firewall pin holing is configured.  Configuring port
   forwarding could use protocols such as PCP [RFC6887], TR-069
   [TR-069]or UPnP [UPnP].  To prop open the firewall, the Measurement
   Agent could send keepalives towards the Controller (and perhaps use
   these also as a network reachability test).

6.2.4.  Multi-homed Measurement Agent

   If the device with the Measurement Agent is single homed then there
   is no confusion about what interface to measure.  Similarly, if the
   MA is at the gateway and the gateway only has a single WAN-side and a
   single LAN-side interface, there is little confusion - for
   Measurement Methods that generate Measurement Traffic, the location
   of the other MA or Measurement Peer determines whether the WAN or LAN
   is measured.

   However, the device with the Measurement Agent may be multi-homed.
   For example, a home or campus may be connected to multiple broadband
   ISPs, such as a wired and wireless broadband provider, perhaps for
   redundancy or load- sharing.  It may also be helpful to think of dual
   stack IPv4 and IPv6 broadband devices as multi-homed.  More
   generally, Section 3.2 of [I-D.ietf-homenet-arch] describes dual-
   stack and multi-homing topologies that might be encountered in a home
   network, [RFC6419] provides the current practices of multi-interfaces
   hosts, and the Multiple Interfaces (mif) working group covers cases
   where hosts are either directly attached to multiple networks
   (physical or virtual) or indirectly (multiple default routers, etc.).
   In these cases, there needs to be clarity on which network
   connectivity option is being measured.

   One possibility is to have a Measurement Agent per interface.  Then
   the Controller's choice of MA determines which interface is measured.
   However, if a MA can measure any of the interfaces, then the



Eardley, et al.         Expires December 15, 2014              [Page 28]

Internet-Draft               LMAP Framework                    June 2014


   Controller defines in the Instruction which interface the MA should
   use for a Measurement Task; if the choice of interface is not defined
   then the MA uses the default one.  Explicit definition is preferred
   if the measurement system wants to measure the performance of a
   particular network, whereas using the default is better if the
   measurement system wants to include the impact of the MA's interface
   selection algorithm.  In any case, the Measurement Result should
   include the network that was measured.

6.2.5.  Measurement Agent embedded in ISP Network

   A MA may be embedded on a device that is part of an ISP's network,
   such as a router or switch.  Usually the network devices with an
   embedded MA will be strategically located, such as a Carrier Grade
   NAT or ISP Gateway.  [I-D.ietf-ippm-lmap-path] gives many examples
   where a MA might be located within a network to provide an
   intermediate measurement point on the end-to-end path.  Other
   examples include a network device whose primary role is to host MA
   functions and the necessary measurement protocol.

6.3.  Measurement Peer

   A Measurement Peer participates in some Measurement Methods.  It may
   have specific functionality to enable it to participate in a
   particular Measurement Method.  On the other hand, other Measurement
   Methods may require no special functionality, for example if the
   Measurement Agent sends a ping to example.com then the server at
   example.com plays the role of a Measurement Peer.

   A device may participate in some Measurement Methods as a Measurement
   Agent and in others as a Measurement Peer.

   Measurement Schedules should account for limited resources in a
   Measurement Peer when instructing a MA to execute measurements with a
   Measurement Peer.  In some measurement protocols, such as [RFC4656]
   and [RFC5357], the Measurement Peer can reject a measurement session
   or refuse a control connection prior to setting-up a measurement
   session and so protect itself from resource exhaustion.  This is a
   valuable capability because the MP may be used by more than one
   organisation.

7.  Security considerations

   The security of the LMAP framework should protect the interests of
   the measurement operator(s), the network user(s) and other actors who
   could be impacted by a compromised measurement deployment.  The
   measurement system must secure the various components of the system




Eardley, et al.         Expires December 15, 2014              [Page 29]

Internet-Draft               LMAP Framework                    June 2014


   from unauthorised access or corruption.  Much of the general advice
   contained in section 6 of [RFC4656] is applicable here.

   We assume that each Measurement Agent (MA) will receive its
   Instructions from a single organisation, which operates the
   Controller.  These Instructions must be authenticated (to ensure that
   they come from the trusted Controller), checked for integrity (to
   ensure no-one has tampered with them) and not vulnerable to replay
   attacks.  If a malicious party can gain control of the MA they can
   use it to launch DoS attacks at targets, reduce the end user's
   quality of experience and corrupt the Measurement Results that are
   reported to the Collector.  By altering the Measurement Tasks and/or
   the address that Results are reported to, they can also compromise
   the confidentiality of the network user and the MA environment (such
   as information about the location of devices or their traffic).  The
   Instruction messages also need to be encrypted to maintain
   confidentiality, as the information might be useful to an attacker.

   The process to upgrade the firmware in an MA is outside the scope of
   the initial LMAP work, similar to the protocol to bootstrap the MAs
   (as specified in the charter).  However, systems which provide remote
   upgrade must secure authorised access and integrity of the process.

   Reporting by the MA must also be secured to maintain confidentiality.
   The results must be encrypted such that only the authorised Collector
   can decrypt the results to prevent the leakage of confidential or
   private information.  In addition it must be authenticated that the
   results have come from the expected MA and that they have not been
   tampered with.  It must not be possible to fool a MA into injecting
   falsified data into the measurement platform or to corrupt the
   results of a real MA.  The results must also be held and processed
   securely after collection and analysis.

   Reporting by the MA must be encrypted to maintain confidentiality, to
   prevent the leakage of confidential or private information.
   Reporting must also be authenticated (to ensure that it comes from a
   trusted MA) and not vulnerable to tampering (which can be ensured
   through integrity and replay checks).  It must not be possible to
   fool a MA into injecting falsified data and the results must also be
   held and processed securely after collection and analysis See section
   8.5.2 below for additional considerations on stored data compromise,
   and section 8.6 on potential mitigations for compromise.

   Since Collectors will be contacted repeatedly by MAs using the
   Collection Protocol to convey their recent results, a successful
   attack to exhaust the communication resources would prevent a
   critical operation: reporting.  Therefore, all LMAP Collectors should
   implement technical mechanisms to:



Eardley, et al.         Expires December 15, 2014              [Page 30]

Internet-Draft               LMAP Framework                    June 2014


   o  limit the number of reporting connections from a single MA
      (simultaneous, and connections per unit time).

   o  limit the transmission rate from a single MA.

   o  limit the memory/storage consumed by a single MA's reports.

   o  efficiently reject reporting connections from unknown sources.

   o  separate resources if multiple authentication strengths are used,
      where the resources should be separated according to each class of
      strength.

   o  limit iteration counters to generate keys with both a lower and
      upper limit, to prevent an attacking system from requesting the
      maximum and causing the Controller to stall on the process (see
      section 6 of [RFC5357]).

   Many of the above considerations are applicable to a "pull" model,
   where the MA must contact the Controller because NAT or other network
   aspect prevents Controllers from contacting MAs directly.

   Availability should also be considered.  While the loss of some MAs
   may not be considered critical, the unavailability of the Collector
   could mean that valuable business data or data critical to a
   regulatory process is lost.  Similarly, the unavailability of a
   Controller could mean that the MAs do not operate a correct
   Measurement Schedule.

   The security mechanisms described above may not be strictly necessary
   if the network's design ensures the LMAP components and their
   communications are already secured, for example potentially if they
   are all part of an ISP's dedicated management network.

   A malicious party could "game the system".  For example, where a
   regulator is running a measurement system in order to benchmark
   operators, an operator could try to identify the broadband lines that
   the regulator was measuring and prioritise that traffic.  Normally,
   this potential issue is handled by a code of conduct.  It is outside
   the scope of the initial LMAP work to consider the issue.

8.  Privacy Considerations for LMAP

   The LMAP work considers privacy as a core requirement and will ensure
   that by default the Control and Report Protocols operate in a
   privacy-sensitive manner and that privacy features are well-defined.

Internet-Draft               LMAP Framework                    June 2014


   This section provides a set of privacy considerations for LMAP.  This
   section benefits greatly from the timely publication of [RFC6973].
   Privacy and security (Section 7) are related.  In some jurisdictions
   privacy is called data protection.

   We begin with a set of assumptions related to protecting the
   sensitive information of individuals and organisations participating
   in LMAP-orchestrated measurement and data collection.

8.1.  Categories of Entities with Information of Interest

   LMAP protocols need to protect the sensitive information of the
   following entities, including individuals and organisations who
   participate in measurement and collection of results.

   o  Individual Internet users: Persons who utilise Internet access
      services for communications tasks, according to the terms of
      service of a service agreement.  Such persons may be a service
      Subscriber, or have been given permission by the Subscriber to use
      the service.

   o  Internet service providers: Organisations who offer Internet
      access service subscriptions, and thus have access to sensitive
      information of individuals who choose to use the service.  These
      organisations desire to protect their Subscribers and their own
      sensitive information which may be stored in the process of
      performing Measurement Tasks and collecting and Results.

   o  Regulators: Public authorities responsible for exercising
      supervision of the electronic communications sector, and which may
      have access to sensitive information of individuals who
      participate in a measurement campaign.  Similarly, regulators
      desire to protect the participants and their own sensitive
      information.

   o  Other LMAP system operators: Organisations who operate measurement
      systems or participate in measurements in some way.

   Although privacy is a protection extended to individuals, we include
   discussion of ISPs and other LMAP system operators in this section.
   These organisations have sensitive information involved in the LMAP
   system, and many of the same dangers and mitigations are applicable.
   Further, the ISPs store information on their Subscribers beyond that
   used in the LMAP system (for instance billing information), and there
   should be a benefit in considering all the needs and potential
   solutions coherently.

Internet-Draft               LMAP Framework                    June 2014


8.2.  Examples of Sensitive Information

   This section gives examples of sensitive information which may be
   measured or stored in a measurement system, and which is to be kept
   private by default in the LMAP core protocols.

   Examples of Subscriber or authorised Internet user sensitive
   information:

   o  Sub-IP layer addresses and names (MAC address, base station ID,
      SSID)

   o  IP address in use

   o  Personal Identification (real name)

   o  Location (street address, city)

   o  Subscribed service parameters

   o  Contents of traffic (activity, DNS queries, destinations,
      equipment types, account info for other services, etc.)

   o  Status as a study volunteer and Schedule of Measurement Tasks

   Examples of Internet Service Provider sensitive information:

   o  Measurement device identification (equipment ID and IP address)

   o  Measurement Instructions (choice of measurements)

   o  Measurement Results (some may be shared, others may be private)

   o  Measurement Schedule (exact times)

   o  Network topology (locations, connectivity, redundancy)

   o  Subscriber billing information, and any of the above Subscriber
      information known to the provider.

   o  Authentication credentials (such as certificates)

   Other organisations will have some combination of the lists above.
   The LMAP system would not typically expose all of the information
   above, but could expose a combination of items which could be
   correlated with other pieces collected by an attacker (as discussed
   in the section on Threats below).

8.3.  Different privacy issues raised by different sorts of Measurement
      Methods

   Measurement Methods raise different privacy issues depending on
   whether they measure traffic created specifically for that purpose,
   or whether they measure user traffic.

   Measurement Tasks conducted on user traffic store sensitive
   information, however briefly this storage may be.  We note that some
   authorities make a distinction on time of storage, and information
   that is kept only temporarily to perform a communications function is
   not subject to regulation (for example, active queue management, deep
   packet inspection).  Such Measurement Tasks could reveal all the
   websites a Subscriber visits and the applications and/or services
   they use.

   Other types of Measurement Task are conducted on traffic which is
   created specifically for the purpose.  Even if a user host generates
   Measurement Traffic, there is limited sensitive information about the
   Subscriber present and stored in the measurement system:

   o  IP address in use (and possibly sub-IP addresses and names)

   o  Status as a study volunteer and Schedule of Measurement Tasks

   On the other hand, for a service provider the sensitive information
   like Measurement Results is the same for all Measurement Tasks.

   From the Subscriber perspective, both types of Measurement Task
   potentially expose the description of Internet access service and
   specific service parameters, such as subscribed rate and type of
   access.

8.4.  Privacy analysis of the Communications Models

   This section examines each of the protocol exchanges described at a
   high level in Section 5 and some example Measurement Tasks, and
   identifies specific sensitive information which must be secured
   during communication for each case.  With the protocol-related
   sensitive information identified, we can better consider the threats
   described in the following section.

   From the privacy perspective, all entities participating in LMAP
   protocols can be considered "observers" according to the definition
   in [RFC6973].  Their stored information potentially poses a threat to
   privacy, especially if one or more of these functional entities has
   been compromised.  Likewise, all devices on the paths used for
   control, reporting, and measurement are also observers.

8.4.1.  MA Bootstrapping

   Section 5.1 provides the communication model for the Bootstrapping
   process.

   Although the specification of mechanisms for Bootstrapping the MA are
   beyond the initial LMAP work scope, designers should recognize that
   the Bootstrapping process is extremely powerful and could cause an MA
   to join a new or different LMAP system with a different Controller
   and Collector, or simply install new Metrics with associated
   Measurement Methods (for example to record DNS queries).  A Bootstrap
   attack could result in a breach of the LMAP system with significant
   sensitive information exposure depending on the capabilities of the
   MA, so sufficient security protections are warranted.

   The Bootstrapping process provides sensitive information about the
   LMAP system and the organisation that operates it, such as

   o  Initial Controller IP address or FQDN

   o  Assigned Controller IP address or FQDN

   o  Security certificates and credentials

   During the Bootstrap process for an MA located at a single
   subscriber's service demarcation point, the MA receives a MA-ID which
   is a persistent pseudonym for the Subscriber.  Thus, the MA-ID is
   considered sensitive information because it could provide the link
   between Subscriber identification and Measurements Results.

   Also, the Bootstrap process could assign a Group-ID to the MA.  The
   specific definition of information represented in a Group-ID is to be
   determined, but several examples are envisaged including use as a
   pseudonym for a set of Subscribers, a class of service, an access
   technology, or other important categories.  Assignment of a Group-ID
   enables anonymisation sets to be formed on the basis of service
   type/grade/rates.  Thus, the mapping between Group-ID and MA-ID is
   considered sensitive information.

8.4.2.  Controller <-> Measurement Agent

   The high-level communication model for interactions between the LMAP
   Controller and Measurement Agent is illustrated in Section 5.2.  The
   primary purpose of this exchange is to authenticate and task a
   Measurement Agent with Measurement Instructions, which the
   Measurement Agent then acts on autonomously.





Eardley, et al.         Expires December 15, 2014              [Page 35]

Internet-Draft               LMAP Framework                    June 2014


   Primarily IP addresses and pseudonyms (MA-ID, Group-ID) are exchanged
   with a capability request, then measurement-related information of
   interest such as the parameters, schedule, metrics, and IP addresses
   of measurement devices.  Thus, the measurement Instruction contains
   sensitive information which must be secured.  For example, the fact
   that an ISP is running additional measurements beyond the set
   reported externally is sensitive information, as are the additional
   Measurements Tasks themselves.  The Measurement Schedule is also
   sensitive, because an attacker intending to bias the results without
   being detected can use this information to great advantage.

   An organisation operating the Controller having no service
   relationship with a user who hosts the Measurement Agent *could* gain
   real-name mapping to a public IP address through user participation
   in an LMAP system (this applies to the Measurement Collection
   protocol, as well).

8.4.3.  Collector <-> Measurement Agent

   The high-level communication model for interactions between the
   Measurement Agent and Collector is illustrated in Section 5.4.  The
   primary purpose of this exchange is to authenticate and collect
   Measurement Results from a MA, which the MA has measured autonomously
   and stored.

   The Measurement Results are the additional sensitive information
   included in the Collector-MA exchange.  Organisations collecting LMAP
   measurements have the responsibility for data control.  Thus, the
   Results and other information communicated in the Collector protocol
   must be secured.

8.4.4.  Measurement Peer <-> Measurement Agent

   A Measurement Method involving a Measurement Peer (or second
   Measurement Agent) raises potential privacy issues, although the
   specification of the mechanisms is beyond the scope of the initial
   LMAP work.  The high-level communications model below illustrates the
   various exchanges to execute such a Measurement Method and store the
   Results.

   We note the potential for additional observers in the figures below
   by indicating the possible presence of a NAT, which has additional
   significance to the protocols and direction of initiation.

   The various messages are optional, depending on the nature of the
   Measurement Method.  It may involve sending Measurement Traffic from
   the Measurement Peer to MA, MA to Measurement Peer, or both.
   Similarly, a second (or more) MAs may be involved.

   This exchange primarily exposes the IP addresses of measurement
   devices and the inference of measurement participation from such
   traffic.  There may be sensitive information on key points in a
   service provider's network included.  There may also be access to
   measurement-related information of interest such as the Metrics,
   Schedule, and intermediate results carried in the Measurement Traffic
   (usually a set of timestamps).

   If the Measurement Traffic is unencrypted, as found in many systems
   today, then both timing and limited results are open to on-path
   observers.

8.4.5.  Measurement Agent

   Some Measurement Methods only involve a single Measurement Agent.
   They raise potential privacy issues, although the specification of
   the mechanisms is beyond the scope of the initial LMAP work.

   The high-level communications model below illustrates the collection
   of user information of interest with the Measurement Agent performing
   the monitoring and storage of the Results.  This particular exchange

   This exchange primarily exposes the IP addresses of measurement
   devices and the intent to communicate with or access the services of
   "Domain Name".  There may be information on key points in a service
   provider's network, such as the address of one of its DNS servers.
   The Measurement Agent may be embedded in the user host, or it may be
   located in another device capable of observing user traffic.

   In principle, any of the user sensitive information of interest
   (listed above) can be collected and stored in the monitoring scenario
   and so must be secured.

   It would also be possible for a Measurement Agent to source the DNS
   query itself.  But then there are few privacy concerns.

8.4.6.  Storage and Reporting of Measurement Results

   Although the mechanisms for communicating results (beyond the initial
   Collector) are beyond the initial LMAP work scope, there are
   potential privacy issues related to a single organisation's storage
   and reporting of Measurement Results.  Both storage and reporting
   functions can help to preserve privacy by implementing the
   mitigations described below.

8.5.  Threats

   This section indicates how each of the threats described in [RFC6973]
   apply to the LMAP entities and their communication and storage of
   "information of interest".  Denial of Service (DOS) and other attacks
   described in the Security section represent threats as well, and



Eardley, et al.         Expires December 15, 2014              [Page 38]

Internet-Draft               LMAP Framework                    June 2014


   these attacks are more effective when sensitive information
   protections have been compromised.

8.5.1.  Surveillance

   Section 5.1.1 of [RFC6973] describes Surveillance as the "observation
   or monitoring of and individual's communications or activities."
   Hence all Measurement Methods that measure user traffic are a form of
   surveillance, with inherent risks.

   Measurement Methods which avoid periods of user transmission
   indirectly produce a record of times when a subscriber or authorised
   user has used their network access service.

   Measurement Methods may also utilise and store a Subscriber's
   currently assigned IP address when conducting measurements that are
   relevant to a specific Subscriber.  Since the Measurement Results are
   time-stamped, they could provide a record of IP address assignments
   over time.

   Either of the above pieces of information could be useful in
   correlation and identification, described below.

8.5.2.  Stored Data Compromise

   Section 5.1.2 of [RFC6973] describes Stored Data Compromise as
   resulting from inadequate measures to secure stored data from
   unauthorised or inappropriate access.  For LMAP systems this includes
   deleting or modifying collected measurement records, as well as data
   theft.

   The primary LMAP entity subject to compromise is the repository,
   which stores the Measurement Results; extensive security and privacy
   threat mitigations are warranted.  The Collector and MA also store
   sensitive information temporarily, and need protection.  The
   communications between the local storage of the Collector and the
   repository is beyond the scope of the initial LMAP work, though this
   communications channel will certainly need protection as well as the
   mass storage itself.

   The LMAP Controller may have direct access to storage of Subscriber
   information (location, billing, service parameters, etc.) and other
   information which the controlling organisation considers private, and
   again needs protection.

   Note that there is tension between the desire to store all raw
   results in the LMAP Collector (for reproducibility and custom
   analysis), and the need to protect the privacy of measurement



Eardley, et al.         Expires December 15, 2014              [Page 39]

Internet-Draft               LMAP Framework                    June 2014


   participants.  Many of the compromise mitigations described in
   section 8.6 below are most efficient when deployed at the MA,
   therefore minimising the risks with stored results.

8.5.3.  Correlation and Identification

   Sections 5.2.1 and 5.2.2 of [RFC6973] describe Correlation as
   combining various pieces of information to obtain desired
   characteristics of an individual, and Identification as using this
   combination to infer identity.

   The main risk is that the LMAP system could unwittingly provide a key
   piece of the correlation chain, starting with an unknown Subscriber's
   IP address and another piece of information.  For example, a
   Subscriber utilised Internet access from 2000 to 2310 UTC, because
   the Measurement Tasks were deferred, or sent a name resolution for
   www.example.com at 2300 UTC.

8.5.4.  Secondary Use and Disclosure

   Sections 5.2.3 and 5.2.4 of [RFC6973] describes Secondary Use as
   unauthorised utilisation of an individual's information for a purpose
   the individual did not intend, and Disclosure is when such
   information is revealed causing other's notions of the individual to
   change, or confidentiality to be violated.

   Measurement Methods that measure user traffic are a form of Secondary
   Use, and the Subscribers' permission should be obtained beforehand.
   It may be necessary to obtain the measured ISP's permission to
   conduct measurements, for example when required by the terms and
   conditions of the service agreement, and notification is considered
   good measurement practice.

   For Measurement Methods that measure Measurement Traffic the
   Measurement Results provide some limited information about the
   Subscriber or ISP and could result in Secondary Uses.  For example,
   the use of the Results in unauthorised marketing campaigns would
   qualify as Secondary Use. Secondary use may break national laws and
   regulations, and may violate individual's expectations or desires.

8.6.  Mitigations

   This section examines the mitigations listed in section 6 of
   [RFC6973] and their applicability to LMAP systems.  Note that each
   section in [RFC6973] identifies the threat categories that each
   technique mitigates.

8.6.1.  Data Minimisation

   Section 6.1 of [RFC6973] encourages collecting and storing the
   minimal information needed to perform a task.

   LMAP results can be useful for general reporting about performance
   and for specific troubleshooting.  They need different levels of
   information detail, as explained in the paragraphs below.

   For general results, the results can be aggregated into large
   categories (the month of March, all subscribers West of the
   Mississippi River).  In this case, all individual identifications
   (including IP address of the MA) can be excluded, and only relevant
   results are provided.  However, this implies a filtering process to
   reduce the information fields, because greater detail was needed to
   conduct the Measurement Tasks in the first place.

   For troubleshooting, so that a network operator or end user can
   identify a performance issue or failure, potentially all the network
   information (IP addresses, equipment IDs, location), Measurement
   Schedule, service configuration, Measurement Results, and other
   information may assist in the process.  This includes the information
   needed to conduct the Measurements Tasks, and represents a need where
   the maximum relevant information is desirable, therefore the greatest
   protections should be applied.  This level of detail is greater than
   needed for general performance monitoring.

   As regards Measurement Methods that measure user traffic, we note
   that a user may give temporary permission (to enable detailed
   troubleshooting), but withhold permission for them in general.  Here
   the greatest breadth of sensitive information is potentially exposed,
   and the maximum privacy protection must be provided.  The Collector
   may perform pre-storage minimisation and other mitigations (below) to
   help preserve privacy.

   For MAs with access to the sensitive information of users (e.g.,
   within a home or a personal host/handset), it is desirable for the
   results collection to minimise the data reported, but also to balance
   this desire with the needs of troubleshooting when a service
   subscription exists between the user and organisation operating the
   measurements.

8.6.2.  Anonymity

   Section 6.1.1 of [RFC6973] describes a way in which anonymity is
   achieved: "there must exist a set of individuals that appear to have
   the same attributes as the individual", defined as an "anonymity
   set".

Internet-Draft               LMAP Framework                    June 2014


   Experimental methods for anonymisation of user identifiable data (and
   so particularly applicable to Measurement Methods that measure user
   traffic) have been identified in [RFC6235].  However, the findings of
   several of the same authors is that "there is increasing evidence
   that anonymisation applied to network trace or flow data on its own
   is insufficient for many data protection applications as in [Bur10]."
   Essentially, the details of such Measurement Methods can only be
   accessed by closed organisations, and unknown injection attacks are
   always less expensive than the protections from them.  However, some
   forms of summary may protect the user's sensitive information
   sufficiently well, and so each Metric must be evaluated in the light
   of privacy.

   The techniques in [RFC6235] could be applied more successfully in
   Measurement Methods that generate Measurement Traffic, where there
   are protections from injection attack.  The successful attack would
   require breaking the integrity protection of the LMAP Reporting
   Protocol and injecting Measurement Results (known fingerprint, see
   section 3.2 of [RFC6973]) for inclusion with the shared and
   anonymised results, then fingerprinting those records to ascertain
   the anonymisation process.

   Beside anonymisation of measured Results for a specific user or
   provider, the value of sensitive information can be further diluted
   by summarising the results over many individuals or areas served by
   the provider.  There is an opportunity enabled by forming anonymity
   sets [RFC6973] based on the reference path measurement points in
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-lmap-path].  For example, all measurements from the
   Subscriber device can be identified as "mp000", instead of using the
   IP address or other device information.  The same anonymisation
   applies to the Internet Service Provider, where their Internet
   gateway would be referred to as "mp190".

8.6.3.  Pseudonymity

   Section 6.1.2 of [RFC6973] indicates that pseudonyms, or nicknames,
   are a possible mitigation to revealing one's true identity, since
   there is no requirement to use real names in almost all protocols.

   A pseudonym for a measurement device's IP address could be an LMAP-
   unique equipment ID.  However, this would likely be a permanent
   handle for the device, and long-term use weakens a pseudonym's power
   to obscure identity.

Internet-Draft               LMAP Framework                    June 2014


8.6.4.  Other Mitigations

   Data can be de-personalised by blurring it, for example by adding
   synthetic data, data-swapping, or perturbing the values in ways that
   can be reversed or corrected.

   Sections 6.2 and 6.3 of [RFC6973] describe User Participation and
   Security, respectively.

   Where LMAP measurements involve devices on the Subscriber's premises
   or Subscriber-owned equipment, it is essential to secure the
   Subscriber's permission with regard to the specific information that
   will be collected.  The informed consent of the Subscriber (and, if
   different, the end user) may be needed, including the specific
   purpose of the measurements.  The approval process could involve
   showing the Subscriber their measured information and results before
   instituting periodic collection, or before all instances of
   collection, with the option to cancel collection temporarily or
   permanently.

   It should also be clear who is legally responsible for data
   protection (privacy); in some jurisdictions this role is called the
   'data controller'.  It is always good practice to limit the time of
   personal information storage.

   Although the details of verification would be impenetrable to most
   subscribers, the MA could be architected as an "app" with open
   source-code, pre-download and embedded terms of use and agreement on
   measurements, and protection from code modifications usually provided
   by the app-stores.  Further, the app itself could provide data
   reduction and temporary storage mitigations as appropriate and
   certified through code review.

   LMAP protocols, devices, and the information they store clearly need
   to be secure from unauthorised access.  This is the hand-off between
   privacy and security considerations (Section 7).  The Data Controller
   has the (legal) responsibility to maintain data protections described
   in the Subscriber's agreement and agreements with other
   organisations.

10.  Appendix: Deployment examples

   In this section we describe some deployment scenarios that are
   feasible within the LMAP framework defined in this document.

   The LMAP framework defines two types of components involved in the
   actual measurement task, namely the Measurement Agent (MA) and the
   Measurement Peer (MP).  The fundamental difference conveyed in the
   definition of these terms is that the MA has a interface with the
   Controller/Collector while the MP does not.  The MP is broadly
   defined as a function that assists the MA in the Measurement Task but
   has no interface with the Controller/Collector.  There are many
   elements in the network that can fall into this broad definition of
   MP.  We believe that the MP terminology is useful to allow us to
   refer an element of the network that plays a role that is
   conceptually important to understand and describe the measurement
   task being performed.  We next illustrate these concepts by
   describing several deployment scenarios.

   A very simple example of a Measurement Peer is a web server that the
   MA is downloading a web page from (such as www.example.com) in order
   to perform a speed test.  The web server is a MP and from its
   perspective, the MA is just another client; the MP doesn't have a
   specific function for assisting measurements.  This is described in
   the figure A1.

                                                            ^

   with Web server as Measurement Peer

   Another case that is slightly different than this would be the one of
   a TWAMP-responder.  This is also a MP, with a helper function, the
   TWAMP server, which is specially deployed to assist the MAs that

   perform TWAMP tests.  Another example is with a ping server, as
   described in Section 2.

   A further example is the case of a traceroute like measurement.  In
   this case, for each packet sent, the router where the TTL expires is
   performing the MP function.  So for a given Measurement Task, there
   is one MA involved and several MPs, one per hop.

   In figure A2 we depict the case of an OWAMP responder acting as an
   MP.  In this case, the helper function in addition reports results
   back to the MA.  So it has both a data plane and control interface
   with the MA.

   However, it is also possible to use two Measurement Agents when
   performing one way Measurement Tasks, as described in figure A3
   below.  In this case, MA1 generates the traffic and MA2 receives the
   traffic and send the reports to the Collector.  Note that both MAs
   are instructed by the Controller.  MA1 receives an Instruction to
   send the traffic and MA2 receives an Instruction to measured the
   received traffic and send Reports to the Collector.

   Next, we consider Measurement Methods that measure user traffic.
   Traffic generated in one point in the network flowing towards a given
   destination and the traffic is observed in some point along the path.
   One way to implement this is that the endpoints generating and
   receiving the traffic are not instructed by the Controller; hence
   they are MPs.  The MA is located along the path with a monitor
   function that measures the traffic.  The MA is instructed by the
   Controller to monitor that particular traffic and to send the Report
   to the Collector.  It is depicted in figure A4 below.

   Finally, we should consider the case of a router or a switch along
   the measurement path.  This certainly performs an important role in
   the measurement - if packets are not forwarded, the measurement task
   will not work.  Whilst it doesn't has an interface with the
   Controller or Collector, and so fits into the definition of MP,
   usually it is not particularly useful to highlight it as a MP.

12.  History

   First WG version, copy of draft-folks-lmap-framework-00.

12.1.  From -00 to -01

   o  new sub-section of possible use of Group-IDs for privacy

   o  tweak to definition of Control protocol

   o  fix typo in figure in S5.4

12.2.  From -01 to -02

   o  change to INFORMATIONAL track (previous version had typo'd
      Standards track)

   o  new definitions for Capabilities Information and Failure
      Information

   o  clarify that diagrams show LMAP-level information flows.
      Underlying protocol could do other interactions, eg to get through
      NAT or for Collector to pull a Report

   o  add hint that after a re-boot should pause random time before re-
      register (to avoid mass calling event)

   o  delete the open issue "what happens if a Controller fails" (normal
      methods can handle)

   o  add some extra words about multiple Tasks in one Schedule

   o  clarify that new Schedule replaces (rather than adds to) and old
      one.  Similarly for new configuration of Measurement Tasks or
      Report Channels.

   o  clarify suppression is temporary stop; send a new Schedule to
      permanently stop Tasks

   o  alter suppression so it is ACKed

   o  add un-suppress message

   o  expand the text on error reporting, to mention Reporting failures
      (as well as failures to action or execute Measurement Task &
      Schedule)

   o  add some text about how to have Tasks running indefinitely

   o  add that optionally a Report is not sent when there are no
      Measurement Results

   o  add that a Measurement Task may create more than one Measurement
      Result

   o  clarify /amend /expand that Reports include the "raw" Measurement
      Results - any pre-processing is left for lmap2.0

   o  add some cautionary words about what if the Collector unexpectedly
      doesn't hear from a MA

   o  add some extra words about the potential impact of Measurement
      Tasks

   o  clarified various aspects of the privacy section

   o  updated references

   o  minor tweaks

12.3.  From -02 to -03

   o  alignment with the Information Model [burbridge-lmap-information-
      model] as this is agreed as a WG document

   o  One-off and periodic Measurement Schedules are kept separate, so
      that they can be updated independently

   o  Measurement Suppression in a separate sub-section.  Can now
      optionally include particular Measurement Tasks &/or Schedules to
      suppress, and start/stop time

   o  for clarity, concept of Channel split into Control, Report and MA-
      to-Controller Channels

   o  numerous editorial changes, mainly arising from a very detailed
      review by Charles Cook

   o

12.4.  From -03 to -04

   o  updates following the WG Last Call, with the proposed consensus on
      the various issues as detailed in
      http://tools.ietf.org/agenda/89/slides/slides-89-lmap-2.pdf.  In
      particular:

   o  tweaked definitions, especially of Measurement Agent and
      Measurement Peer

   o  Instruction - left to each implementation & deployment of LMAP to
      decide on the granularity at which an Instruction Message works

   o  words added about overlapping Measurement Tasks (measurement
      system can handle any way they choose; Report should mention if
      the Task overlapped with another)

   o  Suppression: no defined impact on Passive Measurement Task; extra
      option to suppress on-going Active Measurement Tasks; suppression
      doesn't go to Measurement Peer, since they don't understand
      Instructions

   o  new concept of Data Transfer Task (and therefore adjustment of the
      Channel concept)

   o  enhancement of Results with Subscriber's service parameters -
      could be useful, don't define how but can be included in Report to
      various other sections

   o  various other smaller improvements, arising from the WGLC

   o  Appendix added with examples of Measurement Agents and Peers in
      various deployment scenarios.  To help clarify what these terms
      mean.

12.5.  From -04 to -05

   o  clarified various scoping comments by using the phrase "scope of
      initial LMAP work" (avoiding "scope of LMAP WG" since this may
      change in the future)

   o  added a Configuration Protocol - allows the Controller to update
      the MA about information that it obtained during the bootstrapping
      process (for consistency with Information Model)

   o  Removed over-detailed information about the relationship between
      the different items in Instruction, as this seems more appropriate

      about the aims and not a list of information elements (these will
      be defined in draft-ietf-information-model).

   o  the Measurement Method, specified as a URI to a registry entry -
      rather than a URN

   o  MA configured with time limit after which, if it hasn't heard from
      Controller, then it stops running Measurement Tasks (rather than
      this being part of a Schedule)

   o  clarified there is no distinction between how capabilities,
      failure and logging information are transferred (all can be when
      requested by Controller or by MA on its own initiative).

   o  removed mention of Data Transfer Tasks.  This abstraction is left
      to the information model i-d

   o  added Deployment sub-section about Measurement Agent embedded in
      ISP Network

   o  various other smaller improvements, arising from the 2nd WGLC

12.6.  From -05 to -06

   o  clarified terminlogy around Measurement Methods and Tasks.  Since
      within a Method there may be several different roles (requester
      and responder, for instance)

   o  Suppression: there is now the concept of a flag (boolean) which
      indicates whether a Task is by default gets suppressed or not.
      The optional suppression message (with list of specific tasks
      /schedules to suppress) over-rides this flag.

   o  The previous bullet also means there is no need to make a
      distinction between active and passive Measurement Tasks, so this
      distinction is removed.

   o  removed distinction

   o  added a Configuration Protocol - allows the Controller to update
      the MA about information that it obtained during the bootstrapping
      process (for consistency with Information Model)
