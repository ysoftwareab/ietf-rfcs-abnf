Abstract

   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) is applicable to
   Ethernet switches supporting Provider Backbone Bridge Traffic
   Engineering (PBB-TE) networks.  The GMPLS controlled Ethernet label
   switch network not only automates creation of Ethernet Label Switched
   Paths(Eth-LSPs), it also provides sophisticated Eth-LSP recovery
   Mechanisms such as protection and restoration of an Eth-LSP.  This
   document describes the requirements for the set of solutions of GMPLS
   controlled Ethernet label switch networks.

Internet-Draft        Service Provider Requirements        December 2008


1.  Introduction

   Scalability and manageability of Ethernet switch networks has
   continuously improved, and the deployment of Ethernet switches
   supporting Provider Bridging (PB) [IEEE802.1ad] has became one of the
   solutions for service providers to provide enterprise WAN/LAN
   services.  IEEE standardization activities of Provider Backbone
   Bridge(PBB) [IEEE802.1ah] and PBB for Traffic Engineering (PBB-TE)
   [IEEE802.1Qay] provide an opportunity not only for enhancing the
   scalability, manageability, and controllability of the Ethernet
   service networks, but also for more efficiently deploying access/
   metro access networks.

   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) provides the
   framework for handling and controlling various types of switching
   technologies, namely packet switching with various label formats TDM
   switching, and wavelength switching [RFC3945].  Therefore, the
   combined use of GMPLS and PBB-TE is a fairly suitable "use case" that
   contributes to enhancing the flexibility of Ethernet Label Switched
   Path (Eth-LSP) over Ethernet switch networks without defining
   additional connection layers.

   This document describes requirements for GMPLS protocols to control
   Ethernet label switch networks and comprises mainly two parts.  The
   first one is the requirements for GMPLS extension for controlling
   Ethernet layer.  The second one includes the requirements for GMPLS
   extensions to support multi-layer operation.  Although a large
   portion of requirements in the second scope coincides with the
   description in [RFC5145] and [RFC5146], some of important
   requirements are also described in this document.

3.  Reference model

3.1.  Single Layer

   This document describes requirements based on the reference model
   depicted in Fig.1.  The first reference model is an intra-domain and
   single layer GMPLS controlled Ethernet label switching network in
   which Eth-LSPs traverse over between Back Bone Core Bridges (BCBs) or
   Back Bone Edge Bridges (BEBs).

                                           --------
                                           |  LSR3  |__ P-based IF
                  --------      ----- _____|(IB-BEB)|__ S-tagged IF
   P-based IF    |  LSR1  |____|LSR2 |     |        |__ I-tagged IF
   S-tagged IF   |(IB-BEB)|    |(BCB)|      --------
   I-tagged IF   |        |    |     |_____ --------
                  --------      -----      |  LSR4  |
                                           | (B-BEB)|
                                           |        |__ I-tagged IF
                                            --------
                          |  GMPLS Eth-LSP |
                          |   (BVID/BMAC)  |
                          |<---------------|

   Figure 1 Single layer GMPLS controlled PBB-TE network

   The BEBs provide mainly three types of service interfaces, namely
   Port based service interface (P-based IF), S-tagged service interface
   (S-tagged IF), and I-tagged service Interface (I-tagged IF)
   [IEEE802.1ah].  The "P-based IF" and "S-tagged IF" are connected to
   the I-component of a BEB (I-BEB), while the I-tagged IF is connected
   to the B-component of a BEB (B-BEB).  "S-tagged IF" can perform
   various types of mapping between Service VLAN ID (S-VID) and Backbone
   instance Service Identifier (I-SID).  Here, S-VID is assigned within
   customer network domain or Provider Bridge (PB) domain.  On the other
   hand, I-SID is defined between I-components of BEBs.

3.2.  Multi Layer

   The second reference model is Ethernet and L1 (such as TDM, OTN, etc)
   multi-layer network.  Each Ethernet switch node behaves as a border
   node between the Ethernet layer and optical Layers.  Each BCB or BEB
   terminates Optical Label Switched Path (O-LSPs) with Ethernet
   encoding type and some O-LSPs dynamically form LAG.  Thus, some Eth-
   LSPs traverse over multiple O-LSPs, while other Eth-LSPs traverse
   over single O-LSPs.

   Also, it is technically possible to form multiple layer Ethernet

   switch networks.  Namely, the reference model is defined as the case
   that Ethernet switch network substitutes L1 network in Fig.2, and
   realizes MAC in MAC Ethernet transport.  The routing information of
   optical layer may be isolated (overlay model), shuffled (peer model),
   or virtualized with FA-LSPs (augmented model) for Ethernet switch
   layer.

4.  Requirements

4.1.  Control plane architecture and functionality

4.1.1.  In-band control channel

   The solution should be able to establish in-band control channel,
   while preserving the solution of out-band control channel.  The
   solution should include negotiation mechanism to specify bandwidth
   and priority of control-channel between peer Ethernet switches.

4.1.2.  Neighbor discovery mechanism

   The solution MUST be able to realize automatic neighbor discover as
   realized in current PB or PBB networks.  Namely, the solution MUST
   support an automatic negotiation mechanism to exchange information of
   Node ID, TE-Link ID, Data-link ID (in the case of link Bundling), and
   IP address of the control channel.  On the other hand, the extension
   should be minimized by making use of [IEEE802.1AB].

4.1.3.  Addressing

   TBD

4.2.  Ethernet LSP control

4.2.1.  Prevention of Loops

   The solution should have reliability to prevent creating loops of
   Eth-LSPs.  Specifically if the solution supports numbered TE-Link
   addressing, the solution should define a methodology and protocol
   extensions if needed to detect or prevent loops.

4.2.2.  Service control

   The solution should control various types of service interfaces
   defined in [IEEE802.1ah].  The service types of Egress port

   1) Port based service interface

   2) S-tagged service interface

   a) one-to-one mapping of S-VIDs to I-SIDs

   b) bundled mapping of S-VIDs to I-SIDs such as many-to-one, all-to-
   one, transparent mapping

   Also, the solution should be flexible to following operational



Imajuku, et al.           Expires June 13, 2009                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft        Service Provider Requirements        December 2008


   scenarios,

   1) Any change of mapping of S-VIDs to I-SIDs

   2) Flexibility to nest or stitch higher layer Eth-LSPs.

   3) Any change of bandwidth of Eth-LSPs.  Here, the solution of
   bandwidth modification scenario may include bundling of multiple Eth-
   LSPs.

4.2.3.  P2MP and MP2MP requirements

   To provide the service such as a content distribution, the creation
   of uni-directional P2MP Eth-LSPs should be supported.  Also, to
   provide E-tree type services with multicast traffic, the creation of
   bi-directional P2MP/MP2P Eth-LSPs should be supported.  The MP2MP
   requirement is under discussion.

4.2.4.  Asymmetric bandwidth

   To provide the service which has asymmetric traffic pattern such as a
   kind of E-tree type services, the creation of asymmetric bandwidth
   bi-directional Eth-LSPs should be supported.  The bandwidth
   modification of Eth-LSPs in operation should be also supported.

4.2.5.  QoS control

   The routing and signaling extensions to control QoS based on Ethernet
   traffic parameters defined in [MEF10.1] should be supported.  Unused
   bandwidth per CoS should be exhanged by routing extensions like
   [RFC4124] and the CoS and bandwidth profile such as CIR, CBS, EIR and
   EBS for a requested LSP should be carried by signaling extensions for
   bandwidth accounting and traffic control at a local level.

4.3.  OA&M related functionality

   OAM mechanisms must be defined for GMPLS controlled E-LSPs.  Since
   the data plane is still Ethernet based, the mechanisms should
   capitalize on existing [IEEE802.1ag] and [Y.1731] mechanisms.

   Also, the solution should provide admin status control mechanism to
   coordinate with Connectivity Fault Management (CFM) functionality
   [IEEE802.1ag].

4.4.  Protection and Restoration related functionality

   1:1 protection, Shared protection and dynamic restoration should be
   supported.  Protection and Restoration may be triggered by Ethernet



Imajuku, et al.           Expires June 13, 2009                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft        Service Provider Requirements        December 2008


   OA&M function such as CC, AIS and RDI [IEEE802.1ag] , [Y.1731].

4.5.  Link Aggregation Group (LAG) related functionality

   Link Aggregation is beneficial functionality to realize reliable
   Ethernet label switched networks.  The availability of connection
   between peer Ethernet switches can be enhanced in the case of single
   link failure, if member links of the LAG are diversely routed.  In
   this operational scenario, LAG provides for link protection
   functionality.

   The solution should include methodology to explicitly assign the
   links forming LAG a desired link type (which is similar sense to
   assign link protection type described in [RFC3471]).

4.5.1.  Failure or deletion of LAG member link

   The solution should include functionality to prioritize Eth-LSPs,
   specifically when total bandwidth of Eth-LSPs exceeds total bandwidth
   of healthy LAG members after the failure of one or more LAG member
   links.

   The solution should provide for rerouting an Eth-LSP setup over a
   failed member link in a LAG to another member link in the LAG.

4.5.2.  Recovery or addition of LAG member link

   The solution should include functionality to re-optimize Eth-LSP
   paths after the addition of a LAG member link, i.e. reversion of
   failed Eth-LSPs after the failure of the LAG member link, or
   reallocation of other Eth-LSPs traversing congested Links after the
   addition of LAG member link.

4.6.  Inter-domain Ethernet LSP

   The solution should take into account possible future extension to
   control inter-domain Eth-LSPs.  Here, the possible extensions are
   Eth-LSPs traverse over

   1) I-tagged service interfaces

   2) S-tagged service interfaces, and

   3) C-tagged service interfaces.

Internet-Draft        Service Provider Requirements        December 2008


4.7.  Multi-layer network

4.7.1.  Dynamic formation of LAG

   The solution should include dynamic formation of a LAG after the
   creation or deletion of optical LSPs which interconnect ports of
   Ethernet switches.

4.7.2.  Other requirements

   The architecture and requirements for MPLS-GMPLS inter-working are
   described in [RFC5145] and [RFC5146].  Some of the requirements
   described in [RFC5146] are valid even for the case of GMPLS-GMPLS
   interworking between Ethernet label switched network and L1 network.
   In other words,

   1) End-to-End signaling of Eth-LSPs

   2) Triggered establishment of L1 LSPs

   3) Avoiding complexity and risks.

   should be satisfied even for GMPLS control plane for Ethernet.  For
   more details, see [Interwk-req] and MPLS-TE client network written in
   the document should be understood as Ethernet client network.

   Regarding to routing issue,

   1) Advertisement of Ethernet label switch network information via L1
   GMPLS networks

   2) Selective Advertisement of Ethernet label switched network
   information via a Border node

   should be satisfied even in the case of GMPLS-GMPLS inter-working.
   Note that there is significant difference between MPLS-TE and GMPLS
   controlled Ethernet from the view point of methodology to create
   control channel.

4.8.  Scalability

   The solution MUST be designed to scale according to following
   metrics.

   - Number of nodes

   - Number of TE-Links
