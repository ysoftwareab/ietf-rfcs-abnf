 1. Abstract
  
  This document describes the registration of the MIME sub-type
  image/tiff.  The baseline encoding is defined by [TIFF].  This
  document refines an earlier sub-type registration in RFC 1528
  [TPC.INT].
  
  
 2. TIFF Definition
  
  TIFF (Tag Image File Format) Revision 6.0 is defined in detail by
  Adobe in [TIFF].  The documentation can be obtained from Adobe at:

  While a brief scope and feature description is provided in this
  section as background information, the reader is directed to the
  original TIFF specification [TIFF] to obtain complete feature and
  technical details.
  
  
 2.1 TIFF Scope
  
  TIFF describes image data that typically comes from scanners, frame
  grabbers, and paint- and photo-retouching programs. TIFF is not a
  printer language or page description language. The purpose of TIFF
  is to describe and store raster image data.  A primary goal of TIFF
  is to provide a rich environment within which applications can
  exchange image data. This richness is required to take advantage of
  the varying capabilities of scanners and other imaging devices.
  Though TIFF is a rich format, it can easily be used for simple
  scanners and applications as well because the number of required
  fields is small.
  
  
 2.2 TIFF Features
 
  Some of the features of TIFF (from [TIFF]) are:
  
   - TIFF is capable of describing bilevel, grayscale, palette-color,
     and full-color image data in several color spaces.

     Internet Draft                image/tiff            September 22, 1997

  
   - TIFF includes a number of compression schemes that allow
     developers to choose the best space or time tradeoff for their
     applications.
  
   - TIFF is designed to be extensible and to evolve gracefully as new
     needs arise.
  
   - TIFF allows the inclusion of an unlimited amount of private or
     special-purpose information.
  
  
 3. MIME Definition
  
 3.1 image/tiff
   
  The image/tiff sub-type was previously defined in RFC 1528 as
  containing TIFF 5.0 encoded image data.  This document re-defines
  the original image/tiff definition to refer to TIFF 6.0 encoded
  image data.  The TIFF 6.0 specification [TIFF] is a cleaner document
  and is compatible with previous TIFF 5.0 encoded image data.
  
  
 3.2 Application parameter
  
  There are cases where it may be useful to identify the application
  applicable to the content of an image/tiff body.  As a result, an
  optional "application" parameter is defined for image/tiff to
  identify the TIFF application of the encoded image data, if it is
  known.  No values are defined in this document.
  
  Example:
  
            Content-type: image/tiff; application=foo
  
  There is no default value for application, as the absence of the
  application parameter indicates that the encoded TIFF image is
  Baseline TIFF or that it is not necessary to identify the
  application.   It is up to the implementation to determine the
  application (if necessary) and present the image to the user.

       Required parameters: none
  
       Optional parameters: application
  
          There is no format specified for the value of this parameter
          in addition to that specified by [MIME1].  Various
          applications of TIFF may define values as required.  There
          is no default value for application, as the absence of the
          application parameter indicates that the encoded TIFF image
          is Baseline TIFF or that it is not necessary to identify the
          application.  It is up to the implementation to determine
          the application (if necessary) and present the image to the
          user.
  
       Encoding considerations: Binary or Base-64 generally preferred
  
       Security considerations: none
  
       Interoperability considerations:
  
          The ability of implementations to handle all the defined
          applications of TIFF may not be ubiquitous.  As a result,
          the absence of the application parameter would force
          implementations to decode and attempt to display the encoded
          TIFF image data in order to determine if it could actually
          be viewed.
