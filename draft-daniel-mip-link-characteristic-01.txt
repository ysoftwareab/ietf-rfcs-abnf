Abstract

   This document introduces a mechanism for link characteristic
   information and network information exchange from the mobile node to
   the home agent and the correspondent node.  This model allows the

   the links the mobile node is attached to or could attach to.  Based
   on this information the home agent and the correspondent node may
   shape ongoing traffic flows for the available bandwidth on the new
   link after the handover.  This functionality also allows the home
   agent and the correspondent node to indicate preferred links or
   networks to where the mobile node should move to.  This model can be
   applicable for Mobile IPv4 as well as Mobile IPv6.

Internet-Draft      Link Characteristics Information          April 2005


1.  Introduction

   Mobile IP [RFC3344], [RFC3775] allows an IP node to be mobile when
   changing its location and still maintain existing connections.  When
   the mobile node changes its location, it might also change its link.
   After attaching to a new link, the mobile node sustains its
   connection with the previous node (called correspondent node)
   continuously via specific operation as binding update which sent by
   the mobile node that is away from home to update another node with
   its new address (care-of address).

   Mobile Nodes are more and more equipped with several interfaces of
   different L2 technologies.  As such they may be reachable through
   multiple links at the same time or alternatively use each interface
   depending on the network environment.  Mobile IP scheme, however,
   does not provide mechanism to indicate which link is attached to the
   mobile node or which links the mobile node could be able to attach
   to, but maintain its existing connection.  It means the home agent or
   the correspondent node recognize that the mobile node is still
   attached to the same link.  It can cause some trouble to communicate
   between them.  For example, in some case (i.e.,vertical handover), if
   the mobile node is attached to the CDMA (low bandwidth link) from the
   802.11b Wireless LAN (high bandwidth link), the mobile node needs to
   receive a traffic within its limited bandwidth not overwhelmed
   traffic from the correspondent node, however the correspondent node
   will send its traffic to the mobile node as if the 802.11b bandwidth
   is still guranteed.  Ratio of packet loss will eventually be
   increased.  Furthermore, the home agent or the correspondent node has
   no mechanism to indicate to the mobile node that it should perform a
   handover to a new link or network.  The handover indication from the
   home agent or the correspondent node might not be based on the link
   quality or characteristics criteria but rather to an administrative
   or a general service policy criteria.

   This document introduces a new model for link characteristic and
   network information sharing.  The information is sent by the mobile
   node to the home agent and to the correspondent node.  The purpose of
   this model is to let the home agent and the correspondent node to
   know which link is being used and possibly are available for
   communication between them and the mobile node.  A new option called
   Link Characteristic Information Option is defined in this document to
   provide link characteristics and network informations (e.g., current
   link bandwidth, link type, network name and other information will be
   expanded later if required) to the home agent and to the
   correspondent node while doing a binding update.  This option is
   recommended to be included in the Binding Update Message as well as
   Binding Acknowledgement Message when attaching to a new link which is
   different from the previous link or the link (or network) conditions

   change.

   In wireless environment, all links are not able to support the same
   bandwidth to the mobile node after attaching to a new link.  If the
   mobile node is currently attached to the 802.11b link and then
   performs a handover to a new 802.11b link, the available link
   bandwidth may still change considerably.  So link characteristic and
   network information is applicable also for the same link type
   accordingly.

   To illustrate this model easily, Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775]is only
   described in this document, Mobile IPv4 [RFC3344] will be able to be
   defined following the Type-Length-Value format for Mobile IP
   Extension.

2.  Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Link Characteristic Information Option for Mobile IPv6

   The Mobile Node Link Characteristic Information Option is a new
   optional data field that is carried in the Mobile IPv6 defined
   messages which includes the mobility header (Binding Update and
   Binding Acknowledgement).  Various type and information of link can
   be delivered to the home agent and the correspondent node from the
   mobile node.  The subtype field in the option defined the specific
   link type, current estimated bandwidth of the link and optionally
   network name information.

   This option is recommendable to be carried in the Binding Update and
   Binding Acknowledgement message while performing a handover or when
   the link and network status changes.  The subtype field in the option
   is used to describe the specific link type, link characteristics and
   network informations of a current link, and possibly other available
   links and networks the mobile node is aware of.  There may be zero or
   more Link Characteristic Information options in a Binding Update
   message and at most one option in a Binding Acknowledgement message.

   Based on the information provided by the Mobile Node both the Home
   Agent and the Correspondent Node MAY indicate to the mobile node, in
   the acknowledgement message, that it should perform a handover to a
   new link or to a network.

   o  Option Type: To be defined by IANA

   o  Option Length: 8-bit unsigned integer, representing the length in
      octets of the Subtype and Link Characteristic Information fields.

   o  Subtype: Subtype field defines the link type of the mobile node
      included in the Link Characteristic Information field.

   o  S(elected): The mobile node sets this bit to one for those links
      and networks it is currently attached to.  The home agent or the
      correspondent node sets this bit to one for those links and
      networks they would like the mobile node to be attach to.

   o  Link Characteristic Information: A variable length field
      containing available bandwidth and network identity information
      for a  specific link type as defined in the subtype field.  The
      network identity interpreation is dependant on link's Subtype.
      For example in case of 802.11 WLAN networks the network identity
      could be a network SSID or a BSSID.  In case of GPRS or UMTS the
      network identity could be a PLMN-id [3GPP23003].  The ABNF below

Internet-Draft      Link Characteristics Information          April 2005


      describes how the Link Characteristic Information field MUST be
      constructed:

      link-info       =  link-info-data
      link-info       =/ link-info-data "," network-id
      link-info       =/ link-info-data "," 1*OCTET
      link-info-data  =  "bw=" 1*DIGIT bandwidth
      bandwidth       =  "kbps" / "Mbps" / "kB"
      network-id      =  "nid=" network-id-list
      network-id-list =  1*base64
      network-id-list =/ 1*base64 ";" network-id-list
      network-id-list =/ 1*base64 "," 1*OCTET
      base64          =  ALPHA / DIGIT / "+" / "/" / "="

      The "ALPHA", "OCTET" and "DIGIT" rules are defined in [RFC2234].
      The network identity is always BASE64 [RFC1421] encoded.
      This option does not have any alignment requirements.

4.  Operational Considerations

   The binding cache is a table maintained by each correspondent node
   and home agent that contains the current bindings for mobile nodes.

   To store link characteristic and network information on the home
   agent and the correspondent node, one entry SHOULD be contained in
   the binding cache.  Also the home agent and the correspondent node
   MUST recognize this option.  Otherwise, this option is silently
   discarded by the home agent and the correspondent node.

   Link characteristic and network information MUST be provided by the
   mobile node while attaching a new link via Binding Update message.
   It SHOULD be provided when the link characteristics change or the
   availability of links or networks changes.  When the home agent or
   the correspondent node sends Binding Acknowledgement message, Link
   Characteristic Information Option which is copied from the Binding
   Update message MUST be included.  However, the home agent or the
   correspondent node MAY modify the contents of the returned
   Characteristic Information Option.

   Once taking the available bandwidth of the mobile node, the home
   agent or the correspondent node SHOULD guarantee the bandwidth when
   forwarding the traffics to the mobile node.  For example, The ongoing
   traffic requires 10Mbps bandwidth, but the available bandwidth of the
   mobile node is at most 1Mbps, then the home agent and the
   correspondent node SHOULD reduce their forwarding traffic amount.

   In vertical handover, the mobile node can be moved to various links
   such as wireless pan area, wireless lan are and cellular area and



Park, et al.             Expires October 3, 2005                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft      Link Characteristics Information          April 2005


   each link has its own specific characteristic information.  This
   option can be more valuable model for vertical handover environment
   than horizontal handover.

   Using this option the mobile node is also able to inform the home
   agent and the correspondent node about links and networks it could
   attach to.  The mobile node does not have to obey the preferred link
   and network indication received from the home agent or from the
   correspondent node.

   This document defines the bandwidth information as link
   characteristic and network identity as network information.  However,
   there is no restriction to add other available information, which
   will be newly defined as new subtype and link characteristic
   information when a specific information is needed.

5.  Security Considerations

   Attacker can use this option to reduce the current bandwidth
   regardless of link type of the mobile node.  Furthermore, the
   attacker can use this option to suggest unnecessary handovers to the
   mobile node.  Several mechanisms can be adoptable for both
   vulnerabilities.

   Encrypting traffic at link layer such that other users on the same
   link do not see the link characteristic information.  This mechanism
   does not help against attackers on the rest of the path between the
   mobile node and the correspondent node.

   Encrypting the whole packet, such as when using IPsec to protect the
   communications with the correspondent node [RFC3776].

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA should record a value for Link Characteristic Option including
   subtype (Mobile IPv4 Extension and Mobile IPv6 Option.

   The example below shows the Link Information exchange in a vertical
   handover case.  The mobile node performs a vertical handover from a

   46kbps GPRS network to a 11Mbps 802.11b network.  During the Binding
   Update the mobile node communicates its new link bandwidth to the
   home agent and possibly to the correspondent node.  After receiving
   the Binding Update the home agent and the correspondent node may
   adjust their traffic flows towards the mobile node to take advantage
   of the reported increased bandwidth.

   The following example shows the Link Information exchange in a
   vertical handover case, when the mobile node performs a handover from
   a 11Mbps 802.11b network to a 46kbps GPRS network.  During a Binding
   Update the mobile node communicates its new link bandwidth to the
   home agent and possibly to the correspondent node.  After receiving
   the Binding Update the home agent and the correspondent node should
   reduce their traffic flows towards the mobile node to match the
   reported decreased bandwidth.

8.2  Network initiated handover indication example

   In this example the mobile node is surrounded by multiple networks
   and the mobile node informs the home agent about all those networks.
   Originally the mobile node has been attached to a 802.11b network

   offering 11Mbps bandwidth.  However, the home agent indicates to the
   mobile node in the Binding Acknowledgement that it should move to
   another 802.11b network offering just 1Mbps (for example due some
   existing policy at the home network home agent).  The mobile node
   obeys the indication from the home agent, performs a handover to a
   new network and repeats the network information procedure in the
   following Binding Update.
