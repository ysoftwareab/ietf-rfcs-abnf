Abstract 
    
   This draft states the problem of the current generalized multi-
   protocol label switching (GMPLS) routing in order to deal with inter-
   domain TE links for GMPLS inter-domain signaling. Since the GMPLS 
   signaling protocol introduces bi-directional label switched path 
   (LSP) creation mechanism, an ingress node (or a path computation 
   element) searches for the bidirectional route in the traffic 
   engineering database (TED). Considering the GMPLS inter-domain path 
   creation, the TED contains only outgoing TE information of inter-
   domain links and will not be able to confirm the validity of the 
   incoming inter-domain links.  In order to solve this issue, we 
   describe the GMPLS inter-domain routing requirement in support of 
   exchanging of inter-domain TE link information.

1. Introduction 
    
   A framework for establishing and controlling Multiprotocol Label 
   Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineered (TE) 
   Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in multi-domain networks has been defined 
   so far [RFC4726], and enabling protocols and mechanisms are 
   intensively investigated [ID-RSVP-TE, ID-PD-PATHCOMP, RFC4655, INTER-
   AS-OSPF]. Those mainly focus on MPLS inter-domain networks while 
   toughing upon the applicability to GMPLS. However, since LSP 
   directionality is differing between MPLS and GMPLS, this would be a 
   stringent constrain in the case of inter-domain GMPLS LSP creation.  
    
   Therefore, this document states the problem of the current 
   generalized multi-protocol label switching (GMPLS) routing in order 
   to deal with inter-domain TE links in the case of GMPLS inter-domain 
   path creation. Since the GMPLS signaling protocol enables bi-
   directional label switched path (LSP) creation, an ingress node (or a 
   path computation element) searches for the bidirectional route in the 
   traffic engineering database (TED). In the case of the GMPLS inter-
   domain path creation, the ingress node searches the bi-directional 
   route according to [ID-PD-PATHCOMP]. The TED contains only outgoing 
   TE information of inter-domain links originating from the own domain 
   border node, which might be statically and locally configured, and 
   the ingress node cannot confirm the validity of incoming inter-domain 
   TE links from the domain boarder node in the adjacent domain. Thus, 
   an appropriate mechanism is required to support the information 
   exchange of inter-domain links with TE extensions.

                Figure 1: GMPLS inter-domain network model 
    
   Figure 1 indicates the assumed GMPLS inter-domain network model. Here, 
   we assume a very simple GMPLS inter-domain network model consisting 
   of two GMPLS domains (domain 1 and domain 2). Each domain border node 
   is connected by an inter-domain link (IDL). An interior gateway 
   protocol (IGP) with TE extensions such as OSPF-TE or ISIS-TE [RFC4202, 
   RFC4203, RFC4205] is responsible for distributing the routing 
   information with TE. Between domains, an exterior gateway protocol 
   (EGP) such as BGP-4 or static route configuration may be applied to 
   exchange the reachability information and domain-to-domain routes. 
   The ingress node either calculates the path in its own domain or asks 
   the route to a PCE for GMPLS inter-domain signaling. 
    
    
   3.2 Path computation 
    
   Nodes in each GMPLS domain exchange the routing information with TE 
   extensions by the IGP. The IGP can also distribute the routing 
   information of IDL-out within GMPLS domain 1 by [INTER-AS-OSPF, 
   INTER-AS-ISIS], but not to GMPLS domain 2 because of the domain 
   boundary. This IDL-out is statistically and locally configured. 
   Furthermore, GMPLS attributes are additionally to be supported to the 
   OSPF-TE object in [INTER-AS-OSPF].  
    
   Even if the domain border node 2 may notify only reachability 
   information of GMPLS domain 2 including itself to the domain border 
   node 1 by a dynamic way, the TED of the Ingress node in GMPLS domain 
   1 does not contain the TE information of the IDL-in Link. This is 
   because currently defined protocol mechanisms do not support dynamic 
   way to exchange inter-domain TE links between domain border nodes. 
    
   In the case of MPLS path creation, since the path is uni-directional, 
   the TE information of the IDL-out link in the TED is sufficient for 
   the ingress node. On the contrary, in the case of GMPLS, the ingress 
   node will not calculate the bi-directional route to the domain border 
   node 2 by using the TED, unless the TE information of the IDL-in link 
   is also statically and manually configured.  Moreover, if a failure 
   occurs over the IDL-in link, the Ingress node may not know it because 
   of the luck of the mechanism. Therefore, GMPLS routing mechanism is 
   desired to be in support of exchanging of inter-domain TE link 
   information for GMPLS inter-domain path establishment. 
    
    
4. GMPLS inter-domain routing requirements in support of inter-domain TE 
link information 
    
   In order to solve the abovementioned issue, we describe the GMPLS 
   inter-domain routing requirements. 
    
   In addition to outgoing inter-domain links with MPLS TE information 
   [INTER-AS-OSPF], incoming inter-domain links with TE information 
   should be distributed to the own domain in support of appropriate 
   GMPLS attributes such as a switching capability and an encoding type.

   Consequently, the TED in each domain should be appropriately created 
   so as to contain inter-domain TE links. The TED may be synchronized 
   with the database in the PCE. 
    
   The incoming inter-domain link, as the same with outgoing inter-
   domain TE links, can be statistically and locally configured.  
   However, ideally speaking, dynamically exchanging mechanism would be 
   preferred reflecting aliveness of adjacent inter-domain border nodes. 
    
    
5. Security consideration 
    
   GMPLS inter-domain routing to advertise additionally incoming inter-
   domain links with TE information will not change the underlying 
   security issues of GMPLS networks.
