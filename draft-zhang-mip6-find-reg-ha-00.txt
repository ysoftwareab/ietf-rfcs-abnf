Abstract 

   In mobile IPv6 networks, a mobile node must register its new care of 
   address with its home agent after changing its attachment point, so 
   that it can maintain connectivity with peers. In the deployment of 
   MIPv6, there may be multiple home agents for load balancing and/or 
   reliability. In the case of load balancing, some mobile nodes may 
   register their care of addresses with one home agent, and other 
   mobile nodes may register their care of addresses with other home 
   agents. Some applications may need to query the MIPv6 service status 
   of a mobile node from home agents, such as the care of address, the 
   life time of binding, or other information associated with mobile 
   node that is stored on home agents. In order to satisfy this 
   requirement, the first step is to locate which home agent the mobile 
   node belongs to, that is to say to confirm which home agent to query. 
   This document describes a protocol which can be used to locate the 
   home agent that a mobile node belongs to.

1. Introduction 

   In mobile IPv6 networks, a mobile node must register its new care of 
   address with its home agent after changing attachment point, so that 
   it can maintain connectivity with peers. In the deployment of MIPv6, 
   there may be multiple home agents for load balancing and/or 
   reliability. In the case of load balancing, some mobile nodes may 
   register their care of addresses with one home agent, and other 
   mobile nodes may register their care of addresses with other home 
   agents. Some applications may need to query the MIPv6 service status 
   of a mobile node from home agents, such as the care of address, the 
   life time of binding, or other information associated with mobile 
   node that is stored on home agents. In order to satisfy this 
   requirement, the first step is to locate which home agent the mobile 
   node belongs to, that is to say to confirm which home agent to query.  

   Here are some example scenarios where locating the home agent that a 
   mobile node belongs to would be useful. 

1.1. Retrieve Mobile IPv6 state for AAA service 

   In order to use mobile IPv6 service, a mobile node SHOULD be 
   authenticated and authorized by AAA server which is located in the 
   home network of mobile node. As stated in [GOALS], the AAAH server 
   SHOULD be able to retrieve the Mobile IPv6 state associated with a 
   specific MN from the correspondent HA. This MAY be useful to 
   periodically verify the Mobile IPv6 service status. 

   As stated in [DIAMETER], there are two issues: 

   1. How does the AAAH know which HA to contact to retrieve current 
      status of MN's Mobile IPv6 service in case of stateless MSP 
      architecture and several servicing AAA servers? 

   2. Once having the HA information, the AAAH SHOULD contact it to 
      verify the status of MN's Mobile IPv6 service. This could be

      performed by Request/Response messages initiated by the AAAH 
      server. 

    

1.2. Retrieve Location information for Location service 

   When mobile node is roaming on foreign networks, there maybe some 
   requirements to locate the position of mobile node, such as whether 
   the mobile node is in home network. To implement this function, the 
   location server needs to query the status of the mobile node.  

   This problem also has two issues: 

   1. How does the location server know which HA to contact to retrieve 
      current status of MN's Mobile IPv6 service in case of stateless 
      MSP architecture and several servicing AAA servers? 

   2. Once having the HA information, the location server SHOULD contact 
      it to verify the status of MN's Mobile IPv6 service. This could be 
      performed by Request/Response messages initiated by the location 
      server. 

    

    

   This document describes a protocol which can be used to locate the 
   home agent that a mobile node belongs to. How to retrieve the 
   information from home agent is out of scope of this document. 

    

2. Terminology 

   Application Server Node (ASN) 

      A device that provides some application service. When determining 
      the mobile IPv6 state of a mobile node, it needs to know which 
      home agent to contact. 

   HA-Agent 

      This is the home agent that receives the home agent location 
      request message.

3. Protocol Overview 

   An operator can manage the mobile user effectively by querying the 
   mobile IPv6 state of a mobile node periodically. However, there may 
   be multiple home agents for load balancing and/or reliability 
   purposes in home networks when deploying mobile IPv6 service. After 
   roaming to a foreign network, a mobile node may choose one home agent 
   to register its mobile IPv6 service. When an application needs the 
   mobile IPv6 state of mobile node from its home agent, it should first 
   to confirm which home agent to contact in order to retrieve the 
   information that is needed. This document focuses on how to locate 
   the HA that an MN is registered to in MIPv6. 

   The steps describe as follow: 

   1. Application server node (ASN) sends a request message to home 
      agent in mobile node's home network to determine the home agent 
      that mobile node is registered to. 

   2. After received the request message, home agents determine which 
      home agent each mobile node is registered to. The queried home 
      agent then sends response message to ASN that includes which home 
      agent each mobile node is registered to. 

   After this procedure, the ASN knows which HA to contact to retrieve 
   current status of MN's Mobile IPv6 service. Then the ASN can contact 
   home agent to query the status of MN's mobile IPv6 service and can do 
   further actions. 

    

4. Protocol Operations 

   When ASN sends HALocReq message to HA, the destination address of 
   request message is the anycast address of HA. One of HAs in home 
   network will receive the HALocReq message. If all of the MNs queried 
   in HALocReq message are registered to the HA that received the 
   message, this HA will respond the request message immediately. 
   Otherwise, this HA sends an HASol message to solicit the HA that MN 
   is registered to in the home network. After receiving an HASol 
   message, the HA that the queried MN belongs to will respond with an 
   HAAdv message. After receiving the HAAdv message, the HA that 
   initially received the request message will send an HALocRes to the 
   ASN. 

   The figure below shows the detail message flows for protocol.

                      Figure 1:  Operation procedure 

    

   When needed, the ASN sends an HALocReq message to the HA that in the 
   MN's home network. The destination address of HALocReq message is the 
   anycast address of HA. There may be one or more mobile node 
   information options that need to be queried. While awaiting a 
   response, the ASN SHOULD retransmit HALocReq message approximately 
   every RetransTimer_HALocReq milliseconds. Retransmissions MUST be 
   rate-limited to at most one request every RetransTimer_HALocReq 
   milliseconds. The value of RetransTimer_HALocReq MUST be larger or 
   equal to RetransTimer_HASol multiplied by MAX_HASOL_TIMES. If no 
   response is received after MAX_HALOCREQ_TIMES request, the HA 
   location has failed. 

   Because the destination address of the HALocReq message is the 
   anycast address of the HA, one of HA in home network will receive 
   HALocReq message. We refer to the HA that received the HALocReq 
   message as HA-Agent. The HA-Agent will determine whether all of the 
   MNs in HALocReq message are registered to itself. Based on the result, 
   there are two actions that HA-Agent will do. 

   1. If all of the MNs in the HALocReq message are registered to HA-
      Agent, HA-Agent will send an HALocRes message to ASN with all of 
      the MN's mobile node information.

Internet-Draft  Find the HA that MNs Registered in MIPv6  February 2006 
    

   2. If there are some MNs that are not registered to HA-Agent, HA-
      Agent will send an HASol message to other home agents in the home 
      network with MN's mobile node information options to solicit HA 
      information that the MNs are registered to. 

   While awaiting a response, the HA-Agent SHOULD retransmit HASol 
   message approximately every RetransTimer_HASol milliseconds. 
   Retransmissions MUST be rate-limited to at most one request every 
   RetransTimer_HASol milliseconds. There is a case that some MN's 
   information is received, and some MN's information is not received. 
   In this case, only the MNs that have not received a response SHOULD 
   be retransmitted. If some MN's information is not received after 
   MAX_HASOL_TIMES request, the HA solicitation for these MNs has failed, 
   and HA-Agent MUST indicate this in the mobile node information option 
   in HALocRes message. 

   After receiving the HASol message, HA in home network will check 
   whether there are some MNs in HASol message are registered to itself. 
   If there are some MNs registered to it, the HA will send an HAAdv 
   message to HA-Agent with mobile node information. Otherwise the HA 
   will do nothing. 

   After receiving all of mobile node information, or after 
   MAX_HASOL_TIMES, HA-Agent MUST send an HALocRes message to the ASN. 
   In the HALocRes message, HA-Agent MUST indicate whether there are HAs 
   that mobile nodes are registered to. 

    

5. Message types and Modifications 

   There are four messages in this protocol, such as HALocReq, HALocRes, 
   HASol, and HAAdv. All of these messages are ICMPv6 message extended 
   for the protocol. 

    

5.1. Home agent located require message (HAlocReq) 

   HALocReq message is used by an ASN to initiate the request procedure. 
   It is ICMPv6 message with mobile node information.

   is typically the source address of HA-Agent. The destination address 
   of the Home Agent Location Response message packet is the address of 
   ASN. The number of mobile node information options MUST be consistent 
   with the request message. 

5.3. Home agent solicitation message (HASol) 

   HASol message is used by HA-Agent to send solicitation message to the 
   all other HAs in home network. It is ICMPv6 message with mobile node 
   information.

          field is 1, this field MUST be zero. 

    

    

6. Security Considerations 

   This document proposes new mobility message to resolve the HA that a 
   mobile node is registered to. The new messages are extended ICMPv6 
   message. All security provisions in [ICMPv6] apply equally to this 
   document. 

    

7. IANA Considerations 

   IANA services are required for this document.  The values for new 
   messages must be assigned from the ICMPv6 [ICMPv6] numbering space. 

   Type of Home agent located require message (HAlocReq) 

   Type of Home agent located response message (HAlocRes) 

   Type of Home agent solicitation message (HASol) 

   Type of Home agent advertisement message (HAAdv)
