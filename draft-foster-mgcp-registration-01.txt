  packages and Local Connection Options that are presently described in 
  Informational RFC drafts. If and when these drafts have valid 
  informational RFC number associated with them, the lists provided in 
  this document will be provided for initial MGCP IANA registration and 
  this draft will be allowed to expire.

1. Introduction 
 
  This draft lists current MGCP extensions and the extension names they 
  use in order to avoid name clashing for new extensions. Many of the 
  are extensions are presently in draft form. If and when most of these 
  have a permanently published reference, the enclosed lists will be 
  used as the initial MGCP IANA registration information. Refer to 
  Appendix B of [1] for MGCP IANA considerations.
