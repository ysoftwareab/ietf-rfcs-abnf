2.  Introduction

   The E.164 to Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) [RFC3986] Dynamic
   Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) Application (ENUM) [RFC3761]
   transforms E.164 [E164] numbers into DNS names.  Then, using DNS
   services like delegation through NS records and NAPTR records, one
   can look up what services are available for a specific domain name.
   This is accomplished in a decentralized manner with distributed
   management of the different levels in the lookup process.

   IAX2 is an "all in one" protocol for handling multimedia in IP
   networks.  It combines both control and media services in the same
   protocol.  In addition, IAX2 uses a single UDP data stream on a
   static port greatly simplifying Network Address Translation (NAT)
   gateway traversal, eliminating the need for other protocols to work
   around NAT, and simplifying network and firewall management.  IAX2
   employs a compact encoding which decreases bandwidth usage and is
   well suited for Internet telephony service.  In addition, its open
   nature permits new payload types additions needed to support
   additional services.

   This document registers the IAX Enumservice according to the
   guidelines given in RFC3761 [RFC3761].  The IAX Enumservice is used
   in provisioning the services field of a NAPTR resource record.  This
   field indicates what class of functionality a given end point offers.
   The registration is defined within the DDDS (Dynamic Delegation
   Discovery System [RFC3401] [RFC3402] [RFC3403] [RFC3404] ) hierarchy,
   for use with the "E2U" DDDS Application defined in RFC3761.

3.  IAX Service Registration

   Enumservice Name:  "IAX"

   Enumservice Type:  "iax"

   Enumservice Subtype:  iax2

   URI Scheme:  "iax2"

   Functional Specification:

      The IAX Enumservice indicates that the resource identified by the
      associated URI scheme
      <http://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/prov/iax2> is capable
      of being contacted using the IAX2 protocol to provide a
      communication session.

      A client selecting this NAPTR will have support for originating a
      call utilizing the IAX2 protocol [ID-IAX].

   Security Considerations:

      There are no specific security issues with this Enumservice.
      However, the general considerations of Section 5 apply.

   Intended Usage:  COMMON

   Author:

      Ed Guy (For contact detail, see the Authors' Address section
      below).

   Any other information the author deems interesting:

      None.

4.  Examples

4.1.  Simple IAX Registration

   The following is an example of the use of the enumservice registered
   by this document in a NAPTR resource record.

   $ORIGIN 8.4.1.0.6.4.9.7.0.2.4.4.e164.arpa.
   @ IN NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U+iax:iax2" "!^.*$!iax2:example.com/
   charlie!"

   This contact information indicates that the domain
   8.4.1.0.6.4.9.7.0.2.4.4.e164.arpa. may be contacted by using the IAX2
   protocol at domain 'example.com' with the identifier 'charlie'.

4.2.  Registration with Preference Order

   The next example demonstrates that the domain
   3.8.0.0.6.9.2.3.6.1.4.4.e164.arpa. is preferably contacted by IAX2,
   secondly via SIP, and then H.323 for voice, and lastly by SMTP for
   messaging.  Note that the tokens "iax", "sip", "h323", and "msg" are
   Types registered (or to be registered) with IANA, and they have no
   implicit connection with the protocols or URI schemes with the same
   names.

   In each case, the next step in the resolution process is to use the
   resolution mechanism appropriate to each of the protocols, (specified
   by the URI schemes iax, sip, h323 and mailto).

   $ORIGIN 3.8.0.0.6.9.2.3.6.1.4.4.e164.arpa.
   @ IN NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U+iax" "!^.*$!iax2:example.com/mccarthy!" .
   @ IN NAPTR 10 101 "u" "E2U+sip" "!^.*$!sip:mccarthy@example.com!" .
   @ IN NAPTR 10 101 "u" "E2U+h323" "!^.*$!h323:mccarthy@example.com!" .
   @ IN NAPTR 10 102 "u" "E2U+msg" "!^.*$!mailto:mccarthy@example.com!"
   .

4.3.  Registration with an IAX context

   The following is an example of the use of the enumservice registered
   by this document in a NAPTR resource record that contains a
   destination 'context'.

   $ORIGIN 9.4.1.0.6.4.9.7.0.2.4.4.e164.arpa.
   @ IN NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U+iax:iax2" "!^.*$!iax2:example.com/
   joe?developers!"

   This contact information indicates that the domain
   9.4.1.0.6.4.9.7.0.2.4.4.e164.arpa. may be contacted by using the IAX2

Internet-Draft    IANA Registration for IAX Enumservice       April 2007


   protocol at domain 'example.com' with the identifier 'joe' in the
   context (or user partition) 'developers'.

4.4.  IPv6 Registration

   The following is an example of the use of the enumservice registered
   by this document in a NAPTR resource record that contains a
   destination 'context'.

   $ORIGIN 9.4.1.0.6.4.9.7.0.2.4.4.e164.arpa.
   @ IN NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U+iax:iax2" "!^.*$!iax2:[2001:db8::1]:4569/
   alice?friends!"

   This contact information indicates that the domain
   9.4.1.0.6.4.9.7.0.2.4.4.e164.arpa. may be contacted by using the IAX2
   protocol at IPv6 address [2001:db8::1], port 4569with the identifier
   'alice' in the context (or user partition) 'friends'.

5.  Security Considerations

   The IAX Enumservice does not introduce any new security issues beyond
   any already present in the DNS and IAX protocols except that this
   Enumservice provides another fact that may be harvested and possibly
   exploited.

   The use of DNSSEC [RFC2535] is recommended to improve operational
   security.

   This document requests registration of the "iax" Enumservice with the
   'iax2' sub-type according to the guidelines and specifications in RFC
