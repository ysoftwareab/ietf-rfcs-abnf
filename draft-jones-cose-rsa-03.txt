Abstract

   The CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) specification defines
   cryptographic message encodings using Concise Binary Object
   Representation (CBOR).  This specification defines algorithm
   encodings and representations enabling RSA algorithms to be used for
   COSE messages.  Encodings for the use of RSASSA-PSS signatures,
   RSAES-OAEP encryption, and RSA keys are specified.

1.  Introduction

   The CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) [I-D.ietf-cose-msg]
   specification defines cryptographic message encodings using Concise
   Binary Object Representation (CBOR) [RFC7049].  This specification
   defines algorithm encodings and representations enabling RSA
   algorithms to be used for COSE messages.

1.1.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

2.  RSASSA-PSS Signature Algorithm

   The RSASSA-PSS signature algorithm is defined in [RFC3447].

   The RSASSA-PSS signature algorithm is parameterized with a hash
   function (h), a mask generation function (mgf) and a salt length
   (sLen).  For this specification, the mask generation function is
   fixed to be MGF1 as defined in [RFC3447].  It has been recommended



Jones                   Expires November 19, 2017               [Page 2]

Internet-Draft   Using RSA Algorithms with COSE Messages        May 2017


   that the same hash function be used for hashing the data as well as
   in the mask generation function.  This specification follows this
   recommendation.  The salt length is the same length as the hash
   function output.

   Implementations need to check that the key type is 'RSA' when
   creating or verifying a signature.

   The algorithms defined in this document can be found in Table 1.

     +-------+-------+---------+-------------+-----------------------+
     | Name  | Value | Hash    | Salt Length | Description           |
     +-------+-------+---------+-------------+-----------------------+
     | PS256 | -37   | SHA-256 | 32          | RSASSA-PSS w/ SHA-256 |
     | PS384 | -38   | SHA-384 | 48          | RSASSA-PSS w/ SHA-384 |
     | PS512 | -39   | SHA-512 | 64          | RSASSA-PSS w/ SHA-512 |
     +-------+-------+---------+-------------+-----------------------+

                   Table 1: RSASSA-PSS Algorithm Values

3.  RSAES-OAEP Key Encryption Algorithm

   RSAES-OAEP is an asymmetric key encryption algorithm.  The definition
   of RSAEA-OAEP can be find in Section 7.1 of [RFC3447].  The algorithm
   is parameterized using a masking generation function (mgf), a hash
   function (h) and encoding parameters (P).  For the algorithm
   identifiers defined in this section:

   o  mgf is always set to MFG1 from [RFC3447] and uses the same hash
      function as h.

   o  P is always set to the empty octet string.

   Table 2 summarizes the rest of the values.

   +-------------------------------+-------+---------+-----------------+
   | Name                          | Value | Hash    | Description     |
   +-------------------------------+-------+---------+-----------------+
   | RSAES-OAEP w/ RFC 3447        | -40   | SHA-1   | RSAES OAEP w/   |
   | default parameters            |       |         | SHA-1           |
   | RSAES-OAEP w/ SHA-256         | -41   | SHA-256 | RSAES OAEP w/   |
   |                               |       |         | SHA-256         |
   | RSAES-OAEP w/ SHA-512         | -42   | SHA-512 | RSAES OAEP w/   |
   |                               |       |         | SHA-512         |

   The key type MUST be 'RSA'.

4.  RSA Keys

   Key types are identified by the 'kty' member of the COSE_Key object.
   This specification defines one value for this member.

                      +------+-------+-------------+
                      | Name | Value | Description |
                      +------+-------+-------------+
                      | RSA  | 3     | RSA Key     |
                      +------+-------+-------------+

                         Table 3: Key Type Values

   This document defines a key structure for both the public and private
   parts of RSA keys.  Together, an RSA public key and an RSA private
   key form an RSA key pair.

   The document also provides support for the so-called "multi-prime"
   RSA keys, in which the modulus may have more than two prime factors.
   The benefit of multi-prime RSA is lower computational cost for the
   decryption and signature primitives.  For a discussion on how multi-
   prime affects the security of RSA crypto-systems, the reader is
   referred to [MultiPrimeRSA].

   This document follows the naming convention of [RFC3447] for the
   naming of the fields of an RSA public or private key.  Table 4
   provides a summary of the label values and the types associated with
   each of those labels.  The requirements for fields for RSA keys are
   as follows:

   o  For all keys, 'kty' MUST be present and MUST have a value of 3.

   o  For public keys, the fields 'n' and 'e' MUST be present.  All
      other fields defined in Table 4 MUST be absent.

   o  For private keys with two primes, the fields 'other', 'r_i', 'd_i'
      and 't_i' MUST be absent; all other fields MUST be present.

   o  For private keys with more than two primes, all fields MUST be
      present.  For the third to nth primes, each of the primes is
      represented as a map containing the fields 'r_i', 'd_i' and 't_i'.
      The field 'other' is an array of those maps.

   o  All numeric key parameters are encoded in an unsigned big-endian
      representation as an octet sequence using the CBOR byte string
      type (major type 2).  The octet sequence MUST utilize the minimum

      number of octets needed to represent the value.  For instance, the
      value 32,768 is represented as the CBOR byte sequence 0b010_00010
      (major type 2, additional information 2 for the length), 0x80
      0x00.

6.  Security Considerations

6.1.  Key Size Security Considerations

   A key size of 2048 bits or larger MUST be used with these algorithms.
   This key size corresponds roughly to the same strength as provided by
   a 128-bit symmetric encryption algorithm.  Implementations SHOULD be
   able to encrypt and decrypt with modulus between 2048 and 16K bits in
   length.  Applications can impose additional restrictions on the
   length of the modulus.

   In addition to needing to worry about keys that are too small to
   provide the required security, there are issues with keys that are
   too large.  Denial of service attacks have been mounted with overly
   large keys or oddly sized keys.  This has the potential to consume
   resources with these keys.  It is highly recommended that checks on
   the key length be done before starting a cryptographic operation.

   There are two reasonable ways to address this attack.  First, a key
   should not be used for a cryptographic operation until it has been
   verified that it is controlled by a legitimate participant.  This
   approach means that no cryptography would be done except with keys of
   legitimate parties.  Second, applications can impose maximum as well
   as minimum length requirements on keys.  This limits the resources
   that would otherwise be consumed by the use of overly large keys.

6.2.  RSASSA-PSS Security Considerations

   There is a theoretical hash substitution attack that can be mounted
   against RSASSA-PSS.  However, the requirement that the same hash
   function be used consistently for all operations is an effective
   mitigation against it.  Unlike ECDSA, hash function outputs are not
   truncated so that the full hash value is always signed.  The internal
   padding structure of RSASSA-PSS means that one needs to have multiple
   collisions between the two hash functions to be successful in
   producing a forgery based on changing the hash function.  This is
   highly unlikely.

6.3.  RSAES-OAEP Security Considerations

   A version of RSAES-OAEP using the default parameters specified in
   Appendix A.2.1 of RFC 3447 is included because this is the most
   widely implemented set of OAEP parameter choices.  (Those default
   parameters are the SHA-1 hash function and the MGF1 with SHA-1 mask
   generation function.)  While SHA-1 is deprecated as a general-purpose
   hash function, no known practical attacks are enabled by its use in
   this context.
