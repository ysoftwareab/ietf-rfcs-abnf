1.  Introduction

   [RFC8505] defines the Routing Registrar and extends [RFC6775] to use
   a 6LoWPAN Border Router (6LBR) as a central service for Address
   Registration and duplicate detection amongst Routing Registrars and
   possibly individual Nodes that access it directly.

   [RFC8929] introduces the Backbone Router (6BBR) as a Routing
   Registrar that performs IPv6 ND [RFC4861] [RFC4862] proxy operation
   between IPv6 Nodes on a federating Backbone Link and Registering
   Nodes attached to a LowPower Lossy Networks (LLNs) that register
   their addresses to the 6BBR.  The federated links form a Multilink
   Subnet (MLSN).

   The 6BBRs may exchange Extended Duplicate Address Messages (EDAR and
   EDAC) [RFC8505] to register the proxied addresses on behalf of the
   Registering Nodes to the 6LBR.  The Registration Ownership Verifier
   (ROVR) field in the EDAR and EDAC messages is used to correlate
   attempts to register the same address and to detect duplications.
   The ROVR can also be used as a proof-of-ownership (see [RFC8928]) to
   protect the Registered address against theft and impersonation

   attacks (more in [I-D.bi-savi-wlan]).  Conflicting registrations to
   different 6BBRs for the same Registered address are resolved using
   the TID field, which creates a temporal order and enables to
   recognize the freshest registration.

   With [RFC8929], the Link Layer address (LLA) that the 6BBR advertises
   for a Registered address on behalf of the Registered Node over the
   Backbone can belong to the Registering Node; in that case, the 6BBR
   acts as a Bridging Proxy and bridges the unicast packets.
   Alternatively, the LLA can be that of the 6BBR on the Backbone
   interface, in which case the 6BBR acts as a Routing Proxy, that
   receives the unicast packets at Layer-3 and routes them.  The 6BBR
   signals that LLA in a Source LLA Option (SLLAO) in the EDAR messages
   to the 6LBR, and the 6LBR responds with a Target LLA Option (TLLAO)
   that indicates the LLA associated to the current registration.

   "IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Multicast Address Listener Registration"
   [I-D.ietf-6lo-multicast-registration] extends [RFC8505] to register
   anycast and multicast addresses.  This entails accepting more than
   one registration for the same address and the use of the ROVR field
   as a complement to the index.  In that case the 6LBR does not
   consider multiple registrations as duplicate and retains a state for
   the anycast addresses that it can use to reply a query.

   It results that the 6LBR is capable of providing the LLA mapping for
   any unicast and anycast address that was proactively registered with
   an SLLAO.  This draft defines the protocol elements and the
   operations to try a unicast Layer-2 lookup with the 6LBR.  This may
   save a reactive IPv6 ND Neighbor Solicitation (NS) message, which is
   based on multicast and may be problematic in extensive wireless
   domains (see [I-D.ietf-mboned-ieee802-mcast-problems]) as well as in
   large switched fabrics.  In case of an anycast address, this draft
   does not provide a policy/ logic to select between multiple
   registrations.

   The registration and lookup services that the 6LBR provides do not
   have to be limited to 6BBRs and are available to any node that
   supports [RFC8505] and [RFC8929] to register an address, and / or
   this specification to resolve a mapping.  The services are available
   on-link using an IPv6 NDP NS and off-link using a new variation of
   the Extended Duplicate Address messages called Address Mapping
   Messages.  The policy and security settings that allow the access to
   the 6LBR are out of scope.

2.4.  New Terms

   This document introduces the following terminology:

   Address Mapping Request  An ICMP message with an ICMP type of 157
      (DAR) and a Code Prefix of 1.

   Address Mapping Confirm  An ICMP message with an ICMP type of 158
      (DAC) and a Code Prefix of 1.

   This document uses terminology defined in [RFC8505], in particular:

   Address Registrar  The Address Registrar is an abstract database that
      is maintained by the 6LBR to store the state associated with its
      registrations.

   Address Registration  An Address Registration is an abstract state
      associated to one registration, in other words one entry in the
      Address Registrar.

3.  Overview

   Figure 1 illustrates a Backbone Link that federates a collection of
   LLNs as a single IPv6 Subnet, with a number of 6BBRs providing proxy-
   ND services to their attached LLNs.

   A collection of IPv6 Nodes are present on the Backbone and use IPv6
   ND [RFC4861][RFC4862] procedures for DAD and Lookup.

   The LLN may be a hub-and-spoke access link such as (Low-Power) Wi-Fi
   [IEEE Std 802.11] and Bluetooth (Low Energy) [IEEE Std 802.15.1], or
   a Route-Over LLN such as the Wi-SUN mesh
   [I-D.heile-lpwan-wisun-overview] that leverages 6LoWPAN
   [RFC4919][RFC6282] and RPL [RFC6550] over [IEEE Std 802.15.4].

                      Figure 1: Backbone Link and 6LBR

   A 6LBR provides registration services for the purpose of proactive
   IPv6 ND and maintains a registry of the active registrations for
   unicast and anycast IPv6 addresses as an abstract data structure
   called an Address Registrar.  An entry in the Address Registrar is
   called an "Address Registration".

   The Address Registration retains:

   *  the value for the ROVR associated to the registration, the current
      value of the TID, and the remaining Lifetime.

   *  a list of LLAs that are associated with the IPv6 address and can
      be used in a TLLAO as a response to a lookup.

   Examples where more than one address may be available include the
   case of an anycast address and the case of an LLN address that is
   proxied by more than one 6BBR.

   Unless otherwise configured, a 6LBR does the following:

   *  The 6LBR maintains an entry in the Address Registrar for any type
      of unicast and anycast addresses including those with link-local
      scope.

   *  Based on that entry, it provides duplicate avoidance services
      within the scope of its Address Registrar.

   *  The 6LBR also provides address lookup services for the Registered
      Address using unicast ICMPv6 DAR and DAC-based Address Mapping
      messages.

   The Address Mapping messages can be exchanged using global unicast
   addresses as source and destination addresses, so they can be used
   for both on-link and off-link queries.  NS and NA messages may also
   be used, but in that case the unicast source and destination
   addresses are link-local addresses and the 6LBR must be on-link.

   The 6LBR proactive operations may coexist on the Backbone with
   reactive IPv6 ND [RFC4861][RFC4862] that rely on multicast for
   Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) and Address Lookup.  Nodes that
   support this specification operate with the 6LBR before attempting
   the reactive operation, which may be avoided if the 6LBR is
   conclusive, either detecting a duplication or returning a mapping.

4.  Updating RFC 8505

   This specification leverages the capability to insert IPv6 ND options
   in the EDAR and EDAC messages that was introduced in [RFC8929].

   It extends DAR and DAR ICMP messages for address lookup in
   Section 4.1.2 that use the same ICMP types as EDAR and EDAC but a
   different Code Prefix.

   It also adds a new Status "Not Found" in Section 4.1.3) that
   indicates that the address being searched is not present in the
   Address Registrar.

   A 6LBR signals itself by setting the "B" bit in the 6CIO of the RA
   messages that it generates [RFC8505].  This specification adds a new
   "A" bit in the 6CIO to indicate support of address mapping (see
   Section 4.1.1).

4.1.  Extended Neighbor Discovery Options and Messages

   This specification does not introduce new options; it modifies
   existing options and updates the associated behaviors.

4.1.1.  Extending the Capability Indication Option

   This specification defines a new capability bit for use in the 6CIO,
   as defined by [RFC7400] and extended in[RFC8505] for use in IPv6 ND
   messages.

   The new "A" bit indicates that the 6LBR provides address mapping
   services per this specification.

   Option Fields:

   Type  36

   A  The 6LBR provides address mapping services.

4.1.2.  New Code Prefix for Address Mapping Messages

   The Extended Duplicate Address messages share a common base format
   defined in section 4.2 of [RFC8505], with the ICMP type respectively
   set to 157 and 158 that is inherited from the DAR and DAC messages
   defined in section 4.4 of [RFC6775].  The ICMP Code is split in two
   4-bit fields, the Code Prefix and the Code Suffix, and the only Code
   Prefix defined in [RFC8505] is 0, signaling a DAD.

   The Address Mapping messages use the same values for the ICMP Type as
   the corresponding Extended Duplicate Address messages.  This
   specification adds the Code Prefix of 1 to signal Address Mapping.
   ICMP messages with the ICMP type set to 157 or 158, and a Code Prefix
   of 1 are thus respectively an Address Mapping Request (AMR) and an
   Address Mapping Confirm (AMC).

4.1.3.  New ARO Status

   The Extended Address Registration Option (EARO) is defined in section
   4.1 of [RFC8505].  It contains a Status field that is common with
   with the EDAR and EDAC messages defined in section 4.2 of [RFC8505].
   This specification defines a new Status "Not Found" as indicated in
   Table 1

                            Table 1: EARO Status

   The Status of "Not Found" can be used in an NA(EARO) and in an AMC
   messages as a response to an address lookup operation.

4.2.  Address Mapping Messages

   A 6LBR signals that support by setting the "B" bit in the 6CIO of the
   RA messages that it generates.  A 6LBR that supports this
   specification MUST also set the "A" bit, indicating support of the
   Address Mapping messages for address lookup.

   In the Address Mapping flow, the querier IPv6 Node uses an AMR
   message, which is characterized by an ICMPv6 Type of 157 and a Code
   Prefix of 1.  When used on-link, the AMR message SHOULD carry a SLLAO
   indicating the LLA of the querier.  The Code Suffix MUST be set to 0
   indicating a ROVR Length of 64 bits.  The ROVR, TID and Lifetime
   fields MUST be set to 0 and ignored by the receiver.

   The 6LBR MUST respond with an AMC message, which is characterized by
   an ICMPv6 Type of 158 and a Code Prefix of 1.

   *  If the address is not present in the Address Registrar then the
      6LBR MUST set the status to "Not Found".  The Code Suffix MUST be
      set to 0 indicating a ROVR Length of 64 bits.  The ROVR, TID and
      Lifetime fields MUST be set to 0 and ignored by the receiver.

   *  Else if the address is present in the Address Registrar then the
      AMC fields MUST be set from the ROVR, TID and remaining Lifetime
      values in the Address Registration and the Status MUST be set to
      0.

   *  If at least one LLA is found in the Address Registration, then the
      6LBR MUST place one in a TLLAO option in the AMC message.

   The AMC is sent unicast the 6LBR to the querier.

4.3.  IPv6 ND-based Address Lookup

   A 6LBR that is deployed on-link SHOULD provide NS/NA-based services.
   It signals that support by setting the "L" bit in the 6CIO of the RA
   messages that it generates, indicating that it is a 6LR [RFC8505].

   A 6LBR thus typically sets the "A", the "B", and the "L" bits when
   attached to a Backbone Link that it serves, as illustrated in
   Figure 1.  In that case, the IPv6 Nodes and 6BBRs can use an NS/NA
   exchange with the 6LBR for both duplicate detection and lookup
   services.

   The NS(Lookup) is sent unicast from link-local address of the querier
   to the link-local address of the 6LBR.  It carries a SLLAO [RFC4861]
   and it MUST NOT carry an EARO option to avoid the confusion with a
   registration.

   The 6LBR MUST respond with an NA message that contains an EARO.

   *  If the address is not present in the Address Registrar then the
      6LBR MUST set the status to "Not Found".  The ROVR, TID and
      Lifetime fields MUST be set to 0 and ignored by the receiver.

   *  Else if the address is present in the Address Registrar then the
      EARO fields MUST be set from the ROVR, TID and remaining Lifetime
      values in the Address Registration and the Status MUST be set to
      0.

   *  If at least one LLA is found in the Address Registration, then the
      6LBR MUST place one in a TLLAO option in the NA message.

   The NA is sent unicast from link-local address of the 6LBR to the
   link-local address of the querier.

5.  Backward Compatibility

6.  Security Considerations

   This specification extends [RFC8505], and the security section of
   that document also applies to this document.  In particular, the link
   layer SHOULD be sufficiently protected to prevent rogue access.

7.  IANA Considerations

   Note to RFC Editor, to be removed: please replace "This RFC"
   throughout this document by the RFC number for this specification
   once it is allocated.

   IANA is requested to make a number of changes under the "Internet
   Control Message Protocol version 6 (ICMPv6) Parameters" registry, as
   follows.

7.1.  ICMP Codes

   IANA is requested to create 2 new subregistries of the ICMPv6 "Code"
   Fields registry, which itself is a subregistry of the Internet
   Control Message Protocol version 6 (ICMPv6) Parameters for the ICMP
   codes.

   The new subregistries relate to the ICMP type 157, Duplicate Address
   Request (shown in Table 2), and 158, Duplicate Address Confirmation
   (shown in Table 3), respectively.  For those two ICMP types, the ICMP
   Code field is split into 2 subfields, the "Code Prefix" and the "Code
   Prefix".  The new subregistries relate to the "Code Prefix" portion
   of the ICMP Code.  The range of "Code Prefix" is 0..15 in all cases.
   The policy is "IETF Review" or "IESG Approval" [RFC8126] for both
   subregistries.

   The new subregistries are to be initialized as follows:

     +-------------+-----------------------------+-------------------+
     | Code Prefix | Meaning                     | Reference         |
     +-------------+-----------------------------+-------------------+
     | 0           | Duplicate Address Detection | Duplicate Address |
     |             |                             | Detection         |
     +-------------+-----------------------------+-------------------+
     | 1           | Address Mapping             | This RFC          |
     +-------------+-----------------------------+-------------------+
     | 2...15      | Duplicate Address Detection |                   |
     +-------------+-----------------------------+-------------------+

          Table 2: New Code Prefixes for ICMP type 157 DAR message

     +-------------+-----------------------------+-------------------+
     | Code Prefix | Meaning                     | Reference         |
     +-------------+-----------------------------+-------------------+
     | 0           | Duplicate Address Detection | Duplicate Address |
     |             |                             | Detection         |
     +-------------+-----------------------------+-------------------+
     | 1           | Address Mapping             | This RFC          |
     +-------------+-----------------------------+-------------------+
     | 2...15      | Duplicate Address Detection |                   |
     +-------------+-----------------------------+-------------------+

7.2.  New ARO Status values

   IANA is requested to make additions to the Address Registration
   Option Status Values Registry as follows:

                +----------------+-----------+-----------+
                | ARO Status     | Meaning   | Reference |
                +----------------+-----------+-----------+
                | 11 (suggested) | Not Found | This RFC  |
                +----------------+-----------+-----------+

                      Table 4: New ARO Status values

7.3.  New 6LoWPAN Capability Bits

   IANA is requested to make additions to the Subregistry for "6LoWPAN
   Capability Bits" as follows:

            +----------------+--------------------+-----------+
            | Capability Bit | Meaning            | Reference |
            +----------------+--------------------+-----------+
            | 9 (suggested)  | AM Support (A bit) | This RFC  |
            +----------------+--------------------+-----------+
