Internet Draft      NSIS QSP for Y.1541 QoS Classes       December 2004


1. Introduction

This draft describes a QoS signaling policy (QSP) for QoS-NSIS signaling
layer protocol (QoS-NSLP) application based on ITU-T Recommendation
Y.1541 QoS signaling requirements.  Y.1541 specifies 6 standard QoS
classes, and the Y.1541-QSP extensions include additional QSPEC
parameters and QSP control processing guidelines.  The extensions are
based on standardization work in the ITU-T on QoS signaling requirements
[Y.1541, TRQ-QoS-SIG, E.361].

[QoS-SIG] defines message types and control information for the QoS-NSLP
generic to all QSPs.  A QSP is a defined mechanism for achieving QoS as
a whole. The specification of a QSP includes a description of its QSPEC
parameter information, as well as how that information should be treated
or interpreted in the network.  The QSPEC [QSPEC] contains a set of
parameters and values describing the requested resources. It is opaque
to the QoS-NSLP and similar in purpose to the TSpec, RSpec and AdSpec
specified in [RSVP,RSVP-INTSERV]. The QSPEC object contains control
information and the QoS parameters defined by the QSP.  A QSP provides a
specific set of parameters to be carried in the QSPEC - [INTSERV],
[DIFFSERV] and [Y.1541] are examples of QSPs. At each QNE its contents
are interpreted by the resource management function (RMF) for the
purposes of policy control and traffic control (including admission
control and configuration of the packet classifier and scheduler).

2. Summary of ITU-T Recommendations Y.1541 & Signaling Requirements

2.1 Y.1541 QoS Classes

[Y.1541] proposes grouping services into six QoS classes defined
according to the desired QoS performance objectives. These QoS classes
support a wide range of user applications.  The classes group objectives
for one-way IP packet delay, IP packet delay variation, IP packet loss
ratio, etc.  Classes 0 and 1, which generally correspond to the DiffServ
EF PHB, support interactive real-time applications.  Classes 2, 3, and
4, which generally correspond to the DiffServ AFxy PHB Group, support
non-interactive applications.  Class 5, which generally corresponds to
the DiffServ best-effort PHB, has all the QoS parameters unspecified.
These classes serve as a basis for agreements between end-users and
service providers, and between service providers. They support a wide
range of traffic applications including point-to-point telephony, data
transfer, multimedia conferencing, and others.  The limited number of
classes supports the requirement for feasible implementation,
particularly with respect to scale in global networks.

The QoS classes apply to a packet flow, where [Y.1541] defines a packet
flow as the traffic associated with a given connection or connectionless
stream having the same source host, destination host, class of service,
and session identification.  The characteristics of each Y.1451 QoS
class are summarized here:

Class 0: Real-time, highly interactive applications, sensitive to
jitter.  Mean delay upper bound is 100 ms, delay variation is less than
50 ms, and loss ratio is less than 10-3. Application examples include
VoIP, Video Teleconference.

Ash, et. al.       <draft-ash-nsis-y1541-qsp-00.txt>           [Page 3]

Internet Draft      NSIS QSP for Y.1541 QoS Classes       December 2004


Class 1: Real-time, interactive applications, sensitive to jitter. Mean
delay upper bound is 400 ms, delay variation is less than 50 ms, and
loss ratio is less than 10-3. Application examples include VoIP, Video
Teleconference.

Class 2: Highly interactive transaction data. Mean delay upper bound is
100 ms, delay variation is unspecified, and loss ratio is less than
10-3.  Application examples include signaling.

Class 3: Interactive transaction data. Mean delay upper bound is 400 ms,
delay variation is unspecified, and loss ratio is less than 10-3.
Application examples include signaling.

Class 4: Low Loss Only applications. Mean delay upper bound is 1s, delay
variation is unspecified, and loss ratio is less than 10-3. Application
examples include Short Transactions, Bulk Data, Video Streaming

Class 5: Unspecified applications with unspecified mean delay, delay
variation, and loss ratio. Application examples include traditional
applications of Default IP Networks

These six classes enable SLAs to be defined between customers and
network service providers with respect to QoS requirements. The service
provider then needs to ensure that the requirements are recognized and
receive appropriate treatment across network layers.

2.2 Y.1541 Signaling Requirements

[TRQ-QoS-SIG] provides the requirements for signaling information
regarding IP-based QoS at the interface between the user and the network
(UNI) and across interfaces between different networks (NNI).  To meet
specific network performance requirements specified for the Y.1541 QoS
classes, a network needs to provide specific user plane functionality at
UNI, NNI, and INI interfaces.  Dynamic network provisioning at a UNI
and/or NNI node allows the ability to dynamically request a traffic
contract for an IP flow from a specific source node to one or more
destination nodes. In response to the request, the network determines
if resources are available to satisfy the request and provision the
network.

The call/session control signaling includes an indication of the QoS
requirements for each session.  Obtaining user-to-user QoS will require
standard signaling protocols for communicating the requirements among
the major entities.  These entities include users and their end terminal
equipment, and network service providers and their equipment, especially
equipment implementing the inter-working and signaling function between
networks, and between users and networks.

It MUST be possible to derive the following service level parameters as
part of the process of requesting service:

a. Y.1541 QoS class
b. peak data rate (p)
c. peak bucket size (Bp)
d. sustainable rate (Rs)

Ash, et. al.       <draft-ash-nsis-y1541-qsp-00.txt>           [Page 4]

Internet Draft      NSIS QSP for Y.1541 QoS Classes       December 2004


e. sustainable bucket size (b)
f. token bucket rate (r)
g. maximum allowed packet size (M)
h. DiffServ field [RFC 2474]
i. reservation priority class (urgency of establishing service
connection) can be requested
j. restoration priority class (urgency of restoring service connection
under failure) can be requested

All parameters except <Bp>, <Rs>, and <Restoration Priority> have
already been specified in [QSPEC].  These additional parameters are
specified in Section 3.

It MUST be possible to perform the following QoS-NSLP signaling
functions to enable Y.1541-QSP requirements:

a. accumulate delay, delay variation and loss ratio across the
end-to-end connection, which may span multiple domains
b. enable negotiation of Y.1541 QoS class across domains.
c. enable negotiation of delay, delay variation, and loss ratio across
domains.

Additional signaling functions beyond those already specified in [QSPEC]
are discussed in Section 4.

3. Additional QSPEC Parameters for Y.1541 QSP

3.1 <Token Bucket> Parameters

The <Token Bucket> parameters are represented by two floating point
numbers in single-precision IEEE floating point format.

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|  Peak Bucket Size [Bb] (32-bit IEEE floating point number)    |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|  Sustainable Rate [Rs] (32-bit IEEE floating point number)    |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

When the Bp and Rs terms are represented as IEEE floating point
values, the sign bit MUST be zero (all values MUST be non-negative).
Exponents less than 127 (i.e., 0) are prohibited.  Exponents greater
than 162 (i.e., positive 35) are discouraged, except for specifying a
peak rate of infinity.  Infinity is represented with an exponent of
all ones (255) and a sign bit and mantissa of all zeroes.

3.2 <Restoration Priority> Parameter

Restoration priority is the urgency with which a service requires
successful restoration under failure conditions.  Restoration priority
is achieved by provisioning sufficient backup capacity, as necessary,
and allowing relative priority for access to available bandwidth when
there is contention for restoration bandwidth. Restoration priority is
defined as follows: 


Ash, et. al.       <draft-ash-nsis-y1541-qsp-00.txt>           [Page 5]

Internet Draft      NSIS QSP for Y.1541 QoS Classes       December 2004


 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7  
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|  Restoration  |
|   Priority    |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

Restoration Priority: 8 bits
3 priority values are listed here in the order of lowest priority to
highest priority:

2 - best effort
1 - normal
0 - high

Each restoration priority class has two parameters:

a. Time-to-Restore: Total amount of time to restore traffic streams
belonging to a given restoration class impacted by the failure. This
time period depends on the technology deployed for restoration. A fast
recovery period of < 200 ms is based on current experience with SONET
rings and a slower recovery period of 2 seconds is suggested in order to
enable a voice call to recover without being dropped. Accordingly,
candidate restoration objectives are:

High Restoration Priority: Time-to-Restore <= 200 ms
Normal Restoration Priority: Time-to-Restore <= 2 s.
Best Effort Restoration Priority: Time-to-Restore = Unspecified

b. Extent of Restoration: Percentage of traffic belonging to the
restoration class that can be restored. This percentage depends on the
amount of spare capacity engineered. All high priority restoration
priority traffic, for example, may be "guaranteed" at 100% by the
service provider. Other classes may offer lesser chances for successful
restoration. The restoration extent for these lower priority classes
depend on SLA agreements developed between the service provider and the
customer.

4. Control Processing for Y.1541 QSP

The QNI in a Y.1541-QSP domain initiates, an end-to-end, inter-domain
QoS NSLP RESERVE message containing the Initiator QSPEC, which
specifies the <Y.1541 QOS Class>, <Token Bucket>, <Reservation
Priority>, and perhaps other generic QSPEC parameters for the flow.
The Initiator QSPEC also contains Y.1541-QSP-Specific parameters
including <Bp>, <Rs>, and <Restoration Priority>. 

As illustrated in Figure 1, the RESERVE message may cross multiple
domains supporting different QSPs.  In this illustration, the
Initiator QSPEC arrives in an QoS NSLP RESERVE message at the ingress
node of the Local-QSP domain.  At the ingress edge node of the
Local-QSP domain, the end-to-end, inter-domain QoS-NSLP messages
trigger the generation of local, intra-domain Local-QSP QoS-NSLP
messages.  The Initiator QSPEC of the end-to-end, inter-domain
QoS-NSLP message is translated into a Local-QSP QSPEC.  The original
QoS-NSLP messages are sent directly to the egress edge node.  The

Ash, et. al.       <draft-ash-nsis-y1541-qsp-00.txt>           [Page 6]

Internet Draft      NSIS QSP for Y.1541 QoS Classes       December 2004


local, intra-domain QoS-NSLP messages are processed and interpreted
in all interior NSLP routers along the path, hop-by-hop, up to the
egress edge node.

The ingress edge node uses the Initiator QSPEC to construct the
Local-QSPEC for intra-domain Local-QSP specific signaling, and sends it
in a RESERVE message to the egress node. For example, if the Local-QSP
is the RMD-QSP [RMD], then the <Y.1541 QOS Class> parameter would be
translated to the <PHB Class> parameter. 

Each node on the data path checks the availability of resources and
accumulating the delay, delay variation, and loss ratio parameters, as
described below.  If an intermediate node cannot accommodate the new
request, it indicates it by marking a single bit in the message, and
continues forwarding the message.  When the message reaches the egress
edge node of the Local-QSP domain, if no intermediate node has denied
the reservation, the generic RESERVE message with the Initiator QSPEC
is forwarded to the next domain.  If an intermediate node has denied
the reservation, the reservation is denied.  If any QNE cannot meet
the requirements designated by the Initiator QSPEC, for example, it
cannot meet the specified Y.1541 QOS Class delay variation parameter,
then it marks a <Y.1541 QOS Class Flag> bit to 1 to indicate that the
Y.1541 QOS Class constraints cannot be met.  The <Y.1541-QSC Flag> bit
is normally set to zero.

        Figure 1   Protocol Model of Y.1541-QSP Operation

A QNI requests the Y.1541 QoS class and enables the processing of the
<Available Bandwidth> and <Min Latency> QSPEC parameter, to determine
the <QoS Available> for the REQUEST, as described in [QSPEC]. 

The <Min Latency> parameter accumulates the latency of the packet
forwarding process associated with each QNE, where the latency is
defined to be the smallest possible packet delay added by each QNE. 
This delay results from speed-of-light propagation delay, from packet
processing limitations, or both. It does not include any variable
queuing delay which may be present.  Each QNE MUST add the propagation

Ash, et. al.       <draft-ash-nsis-y1541-qsp-00.txt>           [Page 7]

Internet Draft      NSIS QSP for Y.1541 QoS Classes       December 2004


delay of its outgoing link, which includes the QNR adding the associated
delay for the egress link.  Furthermore, the QNI MUST add the
propagation delay of the ingress link.  The composition rule for the
<Min Latency> parameter is summation with a clamp of (2**32 - 1) on the
maximum value. This quantity, when composed end-to-end, informs the QNR
(or QNI in a RESPONSE message) of the minimal packet delay along the
path from QNI to QNR.  The purpose of this parameter is to provide a
minimum path latency for use with services which provide estimates or
bounds on additional path delay [RFC 2212].  Together with the queuing
delay bound, this parameter gives the application knowledge of both the
minimum and maximum packet delivery delay.  Knowing both the minimum and
maximum latency experienced by data packets allows the receiving
application to know the bound on delay variation and de-jitter buffer
requirements.

The <Available Bandwidth> parameter provides information about the
bandwidth available along the path followed by a data flow.  The local
parameter is an estimate of the bandwidth the QNE has available for
packets following the path.  Computation of the value of this parameter
should take into account all information available to the QNE about the
path, taking into consideration administrative and policy controls on
bandwidth, as well as physical resources.  The composition rule for
this parameter is the MIN function. The composed value is the minimum of
the QNE's value and the previously composed value. This quantity, when
composed end-to-end, informs the QNR (or QNI in a RESPONSE message) of
the minimal bandwidth link along the path from QNI to QNR.

Further details and requirements for Y.1541 QSP processing will be
included in future releases of this document.

5. Security Considerations

There are no new security considerations based on this draft.

6.  IANA Considerations

This section provides guidance to the Internet Assigned Numbers
Authority (IANA) regarding registration of values related to the
QSPEC template, in accordance with BCP 26 RFC 2434 [RFC2434].

[QoS-SIG] requires IANA to create a new registry for QoS Signaling
Policy Identifiers.  The QoS Signaling Policy Identifier (QSP ID) is
a 32 bit value carried in a QSPEC object.  The allocation policy for
new QSP IDs is TBD.

This document also defines 3 new objects for the QSPEC Template, as
Detailed in Section 3.  Values are to be assigned for them from the
GIMPS Object Type registry.
