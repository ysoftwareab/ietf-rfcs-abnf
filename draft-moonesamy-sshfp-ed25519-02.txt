INTERNET DRAFT         Using ED25519 in SSHFP RRs        August 31, 2014


1.  Introduction

   The Ed25519 [Ed25519] signature algorithm, specifically Ed25519-SHA-
   512, has been implemented in OpenSSH.  RFC 4255 [RFC4255] defines a
   DNS resource record, "SSHFP", which can be used to publish a
   fingerprint of the SSH server public key in the DNS.  This document
   updates the IANA "SSHFP RR Types for public key algorithms" registry
   by adding an algorithm number for Ed25519 [Ed25519].

2. ED25519 Public Key with SHA-256 Fingerprint

   The SSHFP Resource Record for the ED25519 public key with SHA-256
   fingerprint [FIPS180-4] would, for example, be:

      ssh.example.com IN SSHFP [TBD] 2 ( a87f1b687ac0e57d2a081a2f2826723
                                         34d90ed316d2b818ca9580ea384d924
                                         01 )

   [RFC Editor Note: Please replace TBD with the value assigned by
   IANA.]

   The following body of the public key file was used as input to
   generate the above fingerprint:

    ssh-ed25519 
    AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIGPKSUTyz1HwHReFVvD5obVsALAgJRNarH4TRpNePnAS

   The opaque octet string output produced is placed as-is in the RDATA
   fingerprint field.


3.  Security Considerations

   The overall security of using SSHFP for SSH host key verification is
   dependent on the security policies of the SSH host administrator and
   DNS zone administrator (in transferring the fingerprint), detailed
   aspects of how verification is done in the SSH implementation, and in
   the client's diligence in accessing the DNS in a secure manner. 
   Please refer to RFC 4255 [RFC4255] for a discussion of the security
   considerations.


4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add the following entry to the "SSHFP RR Types
   for public key algorithms" registry:

      +--------+-------------+------------+

   o  Added an example in Section 2 of the public key file used to
      generate the fingerprint.

Appendix B: Implementation Status

[RFC Editor Note: Please remove this appendix]

This section records the status of known implementations of the
signature algorithm referenced by this specification at the time of
posting of this Internet-Draft.

The Ed25519 signature algorithm, specifically Ed25519-SHA-512, has been
implemented in OpenSSH (http://www.openssh.org) and it is featured in
production version (http://www.openssh.com/txt/release-6.5).  The
software is distributed under a BSD license.

The Ed25519 signature algorithm has also been implemented in Tera Term
(http://sourceforge.jp/ticket/browse.php?group_id=1412&tid=33263).  The
software is distributed under a BSD license.
