1.  Introduction

   ConEx [I-D.ietf-ConEx-abstract-mech] is a mechanism by which senders
   inform the network about the congestion encountered by packets
   earlier in the same flow.  This document specifies an IPv6
   destination option [RFC2460] that can be used for performing ConEx
   markings in IPv6 datagrams.

   This document specifies the ConEx wire protocol.  The ConEx
   information can be used by any network element on the path to e.g. do
   traffic management or egress policing.  Additionally this information
   will potentially be used by an audit function that checks the
   integrity of the sender's signaling.  Further each transport
   protocol, that supports ConEx signaling, will need to specify
   precisely when the transport sets ConEx markings (e.g. the behavior
   for TCP is specified in [ID.conex-tcp-modifications]).

   This specification is experimental to allow the IETF to assess
   whether the decision to implement the ConEx signal as a destination
   option fulfills the requirements stated in this document, as well as
   to evaluate the proposed encoding of the ConEx signals as described
   in [I-D.ietf-ConEx-abstract-mech].

   The duration of this experiment is expected to be no less than two
   years from publication of this document as infrastructure is needed
   to be set up to determine the outcome of this experiment.  Given
   ConEx is only chartered for IPv6, it might take longer to find a

   suitable test scenario where only IPv6 traffic is managed using
   ConEx.

2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL","SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Requirements for the coding of ConEx in IPv6

   A set of requirement for an ideal concrete ConEx wire protocol is
   given in [I-D.ietf-ConEx-abstract-mech].  In the ConEx working group
   is was recognized that it will be difficult to find an encoding in
   IPv6 that satisfies all requirements.  The choice in this document to
   implement the ConEx information in a destination option aims to
   satisfy those requirements that constrain the placement of ConEx
   information:

   R-1: The marking mechanism needs to be visible to all ConEx-capable
   nodes on the path.

   R-2: The mechanism needs to be able to traverse nodes that do not
   understand the markings.  This is required to ensure that ConEx can
   be incrementally deployed over the Internet.

   R-3: The presence of the marking mechanism should not significantly
   alter the processing of the packet.  This is required to ensure that
   ConEx marked packets do not face any undue delays or drops due to a
   badly chosen mechanism.

   R-4: The markings should be immutable once set by the sender.  At the
   very least, any tampering should be detectable.

   Based on these requirements four solutions to implement the ConEx
   information in the IPv6 header have been investigated: hop-by-hop
   options, destination options, using IPv6 header bits (from the flow
   label), and new extension headers.  After evaluating the different
   solutions, the ConEx working group concluded that the use of a
   destination option would best address these requirements.

   Choosing to use a destination option does not necessarily satisfy the
   requirement for on-path visibility, because it can be encapsulated by
   additional IP header(s).  Therefore, ConEx-aware network devices,
   including policy or audit devices, might have to bury into inner IP
   headers to find ConEx information.  This choice was a compromise
   between fast-path performance of Conex-aware network nodes and
   visibility, as discussed in Section Section 5.

4.  ConEx Destination Option (CDO)

   The ConEx Destination Option (CDO) is a destination option that can
   be included in IPv6 datagrams that are sent by ConEx-aware senders in
   order to inform ConEx-aware nodes on the path about the congestion
   encountered by packets earlier in the same flow or the expected risk
   of encountering congestion in the future.  The CDO has an alignment
   requirement of (none).

     Option Type

        8-bit identifier of the type of option. The option identifier
        for the ConEx destination option will be allocated by the IANA.

     Option Length

        8-bit unsigned integer.  The length of the option (excluding
        the Option Type and Option Length fields). The sender MUST set
        this field to 1 but ConEx-aware nodes MUST accept an option
        length of 1 or more.

     X Bit

        When this bit is set, the transport sender is using ConEx with
        this packet. If it is not set, the sender is not using ConEx with
        this packet.

     L Bit

        When this bit is set, the transport sender has experienced a loss.

     E Bit

        When this bit is set, the transport sender has experienced
        ECN-signaled congestion.

     C Bit

        When this bit is set, the transport sender is building up
        congestion credit in the audit function.

     Reserved

        These bits are not used in the current specification. They
        are set to zero on the sender and are ignored on the receiver.

   All packets sent over a ConEx-capable connection MUST carry the CDO.
   The CDO is immutable.  Network devices with ConEx-aware functions
   read the flags, but all network devices MUST forward the CDO
   unaltered.

   CDO MUST be placed as the first option in the destination option
   header before the AH and/or ESP (if present).  IPsec Authentication
   Header (AH) MAY be used to verify that the CDO has not been modified.

   If the X bit is zero all other three bits are undefined and thus
   should be ignored and forwarded unchanged by network nodes.  The X
   bit set to zero means that the connection is ConEx-capable but this
   packet MUST NOT be counted when determining ConEx information in an
   audit function.  This can be the case if no congestion feedback is
   (currently) available e.g. in TCP if one endpoint has been receiving
   data but sending nothing but pure ACKs (no user data) for some time.
   This is because pure ACKs do not advance the sequence number, so the
   TCP endpoint receiving them cannot reliably tell whether any have
   been lost due to congestion.  Pure TCP ACKs cannot be ECN-marked
   either [RFC3168].

   If the X bit is set, any of the other three bits (L, E, C) MAY be
   set.  Whenever one of these bits is set, the number of bytes carried
   by this IP packet (including the IP header that directly encapsulates
   the CDO and everything that IP header encapsulates) SHOULD be counted
   to determine congestion or credit information.  In IPv6 the number of
   bytes can easily be calculated by adding the number 40 (length of the
   IPv6 header in bytes) to the value present in the Payload Length
   field in the IPv6 header.

   A transport sends credits prior to the occurrence of congestion (loss
   or ECN-CE marks) and the amount of credits should cover the
   congestion risk.  Note, the maximum congestion risk is that all
   packets in flight get lost or ECN marked.

   If the L or E bit is set, a congestion signal in the form of a loss
   or, respectively, an ECN mark was previously experienced by the same
   connection.

Internet-Draft          ConEx Destination Option           November 2014


   In principle all of these three bits (L, E, C) MAY be set in the same
   packet.  In this case the packet size MUST be accounted more than
   once for each respective ConEx information counter.

   If a network node extracts the ConEx information from a connection,
   it is expected to hold this information in bytes, e.g. comparing the
   total number of bytes sent with the number of bytes sent with ConEx
   congestion marks (L, E) to determine the current whole path
   congestion level.  For ConEx-aware node processing, the CDO MUST use
   the Payload length field of the preceding IPv6 header for byte-based
   accounting.  When a ratio is measured and equally sized packets can
   be assumed, counting the number of packets (instead of the number of
   bytes) should deliver the same result.  But a network node must be
   aware that this estimation can be quite wrong, if e.g. different
   sized packed are sent and thus it is not reliable.

   A ConEx sender SHOULD set the reserved bits in the CDO to zero.
   Other nodes MUST ignore these bits and ConEx-aware intermediate nodes
   MUST forward them unchanged, whatever their values.  They MAY log the
   presence of a non-zero reserved field.

   It might be possible to implement a proxy for a ConEx sender, as long
   as it is located where receiver feedback is always visible.  A ConEx
   proxy MUST NOT introduce a CDO header into a packet already carrying
   one and it MUST NOT alter the information in any existing CDO header.
   However, it can add a CDO header to any packets without one, taking
   care not to disrupt any integrity or authentication mechanisms.

   The CDO is only applicable on unicast or anycast packets (see
   [I-D.ietf-ConEx-abstract-mech] for reasoning).  A ConEx sender MUST
   NOT send a packet with the CDO to a multicast address.  ConEx-capable
   network nodes MUST treat a multicast packet with the X flag set the
   same as an equivalent packet without the CDO, but they SHOULD forward
   it unchanged.

   There are no warning or error messages associated with the CDO.

5.  Implementation in the fast path of ConEx-aware routers

   The ConEx information is being encoded into a destination option so
   that it does not impact forwarding performance in the non-ConEx-aware
   nodes on the path.  Since destination options are not usually
   processed by routers, the existence of the CDO does not affect the
   fast path processing of the datagram on non-ConEx-aware routers. i.e.
   They are not pushed into the slow path towards the control plane for
   exception processing.





Krishnan, et al.          Expires May 14, 2015                  [Page 6]

Internet-Draft          ConEx Destination Option           November 2014


   The ConEx-aware nodes still need to process the CDO without severely
   affecting forwarding.  For this to be possible, the ConEx-aware
   routers need to quickly ascertain the presence of the CDO and process
   the option if it is present.  To efficiently perform this, the CDO
   needs to be placed in a fairly deterministic location.  In order to
   facilitate forwarding on ConEx-aware routers, ConEx-aware senders
   that send IPv6 datagrams with the CDO MUST place the CDO as the first
   destination option in the destination options header.

6.  Tunnel Processing

   As with any destination option, an ingress tunnel endpoint will not
   natively copy the CDO when adding an encapsulating outer IP header.
   In general an ingress tunnel SHOULD NOT copy the CDO to the outer
   header as this would changed the number of bytes that would be
   counted.  However, it MAY copy the CDO to the outer in order to
   facilitate visibility by subsequent on-path ConEx functions if the
   configuration of the tunnel ingress and the ConEx nodes is co-
   ordinated.  This trades off the performance of ConEx functions
   against that of tunnel processing.

   An egress tunnel endpoint SHOULD ignore any CDO on decapsulation of
   an outer IP header.  The information in any inner CDO will always be
   considered correct, even if it differs from any outer CDO.
   Therefore, the decapsulator can strip the outer CDO without
   comparison to the inner.  A decapsulator MAY compare the two, and MAY
   log any case where they differ.  However, the packet MUST be
   forwarded irrespective of any such anomaly, given an outer CDO is
   only a performance optimization.

   A network node that assesses ConEx information SHOULD search for
   encapsulated IP headers until a CDO is found.  At any specific
   network location, the maximum necessary depth of search is likely to
   be the same for all packets.

7.  Compatibility with use of IPsec

   If the transport network cannot be trusted, IPsec Authentication
   should be used to ensure integrity of the ConEx information.  If an
   attacker would be able to remove the ConEx marks, this could cause an
   audit device to penalize the respective connection, while the sender
   cannot easily detect that ConEx information is missing.

   In IPv6 a Destination Option header can be placed in two possible
   position in the order of possible headers, either before the Routing
   header or after the Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) header
   [RFC2460].  As the CDO is placed in the destination option header
   before the AH and/or ESP, it is not encrypted in transport mode



Krishnan, et al.          Expires May 14, 2015                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft          ConEx Destination Option           November 2014


   [RFC4301].  Otherwise, if the CDO were placed in the latter position
   and an ESP header were used, the CDO would also be encrypted and
   could not be interpreted by ConEx-aware devices.

   The IPv6 protocol architecture currently does not provide a mechanism
   for new headers to be copied to the outer IP header.  Therefore if
   IPsec encryption is used in tunnel mode, ConEx information cannot be
   accessed over the extent of the ESP tunnel.

8.  Mitigating flooding attacks by using preferential drop

   This section is aspirational, and not critical to the use of ConEx
   for more general traffic management.  However, once CDO information
   is present, the CDO header could optionally also be used in the data
   plane of any IP-aware forwarding node to mitigate flooding attacks.

   If a router queue experiences very high load so that it has to drop
   arriving packets, it MAY preferentially drop packets within the same
   Diffserv PHB using the preference order given in Table 1 (1 means
   drop first).  Additionally, if a router implements preferential drop
   based on ConEx it SHOULD also support ECN-marking.  Preferential
   dropping can be difficult to implement on some hardware, but if
   feasible it would discriminate against attack traffic if done as part
   of the overall policing framework as described in
   [I-D.ietf-ConEx-abstract-mech].  If nowhere else, routers at the
   egress of a network SHOULD implement preferential drop based on ConEx
   markings(stronger than the MAY above).

                 +----------------------+----------------+
                 |                      |   Preference   |
                 +----------------------+----------------+
                 | Not-ConEx or no CDO  | 1 (drop first) |
                 | X (but not L,E or C) |       2        |
                 | X and L,E or C       |       3        |
                 +----------------------+----------------+

                Table 1: Drop preference for ConEx packets

   A flooding attack is inherently about congestion of a resource.  As
   load focuses on a victim, upstream queues grow, requiring honest
   sources to pre-load packets with a higher fraction of ConEx-marks.

   If ECN marking is supported by downstream queues, preferential
   dropping provides the most benefits because, if the queue is so
   congested that it drops traffic, it will be CE-marking 100% of any
   forwarded traffic.  Honest sources will therefore be sending 100%
   ConEx E-marked packets (and subject to rate-limiting at an ingress
   policer).  Senders under malicious control can either do the same as



Krishnan, et al.          Expires May 14, 2015                  [Page 8]

Internet-Draft          ConEx Destination Option           November 2014


   honest sources, and be rate-limited at ingress, or they can
   understate congestion and not set the E bit.  If the preferential
   drop ranking is implemented on queues, these queues will preserve E/
   L-marked traffic until last.  So, the traffic from malicious sources
   will all be automatically dropped first.  Either way, malicious
   sources cannot send more than honest sources.

10.  Security Considerations

   [I-D.ietf-ConEx-abstract-mech] describes the overall audit framework
   for assuring that ConEx markings truly reflect actual path
   congestion.  This section focuses purely on the security of the
   encoding chosen for ConEx markings.

   The chg bit in the CDO option type field is set to zero, meaning that
   the CDO option is immutable.  If IPsec AH is used, a zero chg bit
   causes AH to cover the CDO option so that its end-to-end integrity
   can be verified, as explained in Section 4.

   This document specifies that the Reserved field in the CDO must be
   ignored and forwarded unchanged even if it does not contain all
   zeroes.  The Reserved field is also required to sit outside the
   encrypting security payload (ESP), at least in transport mode (see
   Section 7).  This allows the sender to use the Reserved field as a 28
   -bit-per-packet covert channel to send information to an on-path node
   outside the control of IPsec.  However, a covert channel is only a
   concern if it can circumvent IPsec in tunnel mode and, in the tunnel
   mode case, ESP would close the covert channel as outlined in
   Section 7.

11.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new IPv6 ConEx destination option for
   carrying ConEx markings.  IANA is requested to assign a new
   destination option type in the Destination Options registry
   maintained at http://www.iana.org/assignments/ipv6-parameters <TBA1>
   ConEx Destination Option [RFCXXXX] The act bits for this option need
   to be 00.  The destination IP stack will not usually process the CDO,
   therefore the sender can send a CDO without checking if the receiver

   will understand it.  The CDO MUST still be forwarded to the
   destination IP stack, because the destination might check the
   integrity of the whole packet, irrespective of whether it understands
   ConEx.
