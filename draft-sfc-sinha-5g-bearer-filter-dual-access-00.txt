        5G-Core System Split Bearer's FILTER for Dual Access
          draft-sfc-sinha-5g-bearer-filter-dual-access-00



Abstract

   This document attempts the case for new work that need to be 
   developed for 5G user to improve faster download and upload of user's
   data via FILTER mechanism to be implemented at UPF user plane data
   for dual-access outlining the poor radio coverage issue. FILTER
   template governs the user data split at UPF with maintaining agreed
   PCC rules to achieve required throughput.

1. Introduction

   5G system have been evolved to server user in more efficient way of
   meeting higher download and upload of user data, whereas 5G Users 
   accessing the network via wireline and wireless, in addition to this
   Residential Gateway RG and IoT support is also defined. Access and 
   user experience is a challenging for poor radio coverage (for both
   wi-fi and RAN). Hence re-engineering proposal has made in this
   document of 5G-Core entity UPF which is connected to Data Network
   handling user plane.

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.1 5G System architecture

   access type 3GPP and Wi-Fi being supported by UE is shown in Figure 1

      Figure 1 : Simplified 5G System Architecture for Multi access


   For the clarity in the current document proposal, multiple node/
   function like UDSF, NRF, and interfaces N9, N14 are not shown.

   5G-system supporting UE access to the network function and services
   via non-3GPP like WLAN or Wi-Fi. The N3IWF interface connect UE with
   5G-core network via N2 and N3 interface.

3.2 QoS 

   QFI is defined as QoS Flow ID is an identity to QoS flow in the 5G 
   system. All data traffic within a PDU session are each labelled or 
   identified by QFI, implies same QFI labelled data flow will receives
   same traffic forwarding treatment like scheduling, priority, etc.

   Data flow is via N3(and N3 and N9) interface, being encapsulated
   end-to-end. This flow is controlled by SMF, who provides QoS profile
   during session establishment to R(AN) and provide the PDR to the UPF.

   Please Note that like 4G system, default QoS flow is applied to each 
   PDU session and retain till lifetime span of connectivity. In case
   of non-3GPP access QFI is delivered to N3IWF entity (or NG-RAN) for 
   every time User Plane of the PDU session is established, modified or
   activated.

3.3 Dual Connectivity

   Dual connectivity (DC) functionality support the network to make use
   of additional radio resource to achieve required throughput in
   downlink and uplink of user data. This was introduced in 4G system 
   support 5G data speed by addition of dual connectivity of UE with 
   eNBs, master eNB and secondary eNB and /or eNodeB in congestion with
   gNB. This is achieved by addition of secondary eNodeB to the Master
   eNodeB. MeNB has full control to add, delete and HO(handover) of
   eNodeBs as and when needed.

3.4 Problem Statement

   Problem statement: In spite, in a Dual connectivity of 5G system, 
   Master-gNB may have degrade radio condition and neither another 
   Master-gNB nor secondary gNB available to support user data traffic
   and Secondary-gNB is available with sufficient radio resource.

4. 5G-Core System split bearer's FILTER for dual Access

   4G system was designed such that it provides one default bearer for
   each APN type (service type). That is UE after attach procedure with
   access network, PGW create default data bearer of QCI=9 for data 
   service. Again, if UE has voice capability, then it triggers new PDN
   connect request for APN=ims for voice & Video services, for which 
   P-GW creates QCI=5 bearer as a default bearer.

   5G system is designed to support dual access mechanism such that
   both 3GPP and non-3GPP access at same time. In this case P-GW needed
   to maintain two default bearers for each APN instead of one, as 
   explained below. 

   Please note: How an APN with same name to maintain two defaults
   bearers or APN name to be modified for each access type is out of
   scope of this document. However, details of setup procedure and call
   flow mechanism is beyond the scope of this draft,
   draft-sinha-5g-split-bearer-dual-access-00 can be referred. 

   As shown in figure 2, for APN=data
   - PGW will create a default bearer QCI=9 for Wi-Fi access
   - PGW will create another default bearer QCI=9 for RAN access

   registration for RAN on QCI=5 and for Wi-Fi on separate QCI=5
   Taking an example of voice call, one voice call established over RAN
   with QCI=1 and another voice call can be established in parallel over
   Wi-Fi over separate QCI=1. This dedicated bearer MUST be implemented
   with FILTER mechanism for data sharing. 

   In case of poor radio coverage of RAN, for example, split bearer
   between RAN and Wi-Fi using this FILTER such that some part of audio
   packets are delivered to user via RAN and some via Wi-Fi, thus
   enhancing the user experience.

   SMF will be splitting the downlink packet in SPLIT mode via FILTER 
   mechanism while maintaining PCC rule in tagged.

   Traffic FILTER mechanism is needed to be implemented between each
   QCI type for same APN, for only for DEDICATED bearer, not default
   bearer. This Filter mechanism will control traffic packet
   segmentation to be delivered on each of QCI.

5. Security Considerations

   Security considerations related to the 5G systems are discussed in
   [NGMN].  Due to the request for intrinsic realization of security
   such aspects must be considered by design for architecture and
   protocols.

   Especially as a joint usage of resources and network functions by
   different separate logical network slices (e.g. in terms of virtual
   network functions) seems to be inevitable in the framework of 5G the
   need for strong security measures in such an environment is a major
   challenge.

6. IANA Considerations

   None.

7. Privacy Considerations

   Support of full privacy of the users (customers and tenants / end
   service providers) is a basic feature of the next generation trusted
   and reliable communications offering system.  Such a high degree of
   ensured privacy shall be reflected in the proposed architecture and
   protocol solutions.

   Especially as Identifiers and mapping of locators to them are
   addressed some privacy concerns arise.  Mobility solutions tend to
   expose unique identifiers. A solution inside the mobile network
   exposes these identifiers to the network operator, which is not a big
   deal since the network operator already has information about the
   device's location. In contrast, an IP level solution exposes both

   the identifiers and the locations at the IP layer. That means that
   web sites, for example, can now track the device's successive
   locations by watching the IP address. Solutions such as transporting
   the identifiers not as part of the IP header should be considered.
