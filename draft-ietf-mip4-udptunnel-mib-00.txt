1. Introduction 

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) 
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. 
   In particular, it describes managed objects used for managing the 
   Mobile Node, Foreign Agent and Home Agent when Mobile IP Traversal of 
   Network Address Translation (NAT) Devices are used. 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119]. 

2. The Internet-Standard Management Framework 

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current 
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of 
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410]. 

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally 
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). 
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the 
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB 
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, 
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580  
   [RFC2580]. 

3. Structure of the MIB 

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) 
   for the use with network management protocols in the Internet 
   community.  In particular, it describes managed objects for the 
   Mobile IP Traversal of Network Address Translation (NAT) Devices as 
   defined in [RFC3519]. 

3.1. Structure of the Mobile IP UDP Tunneling 

   The Mobile IP Traversal of Network Address Translation (NAT) Devices 
   specification [RFC3519] specifies a few managed entities. These are 
   the behavior to force and accept udp tunneling, and the configuration 
   of the keep alive timers. 

   The Mobile IP Traversal of Network Address Translation (NAT) Devices 
   specification [RFC3519] also specifies a new error code for 
   "Requested UDP tunnel encapsulation unavailable". Therefore a counter 
   object for this error code is also included in this mib module.

   Further, it's good practice to include object to enable and disable 
   the MIP UDP tuning completely.  

   Configuration of MIP UDP tunneling has been deployed in various 
   vendor implementations for years. Field experience have shown that 
   it's indeed a good idea to always use UDP tunneling instead if the 
   original Mobile IP tunneling methods. Therefore, an object is added 
   in the HA to always force the use of UDP tunneling to all UDP 
   tunneling capable nodes, regardless of F-flag or outcome of NAT test.  

3.2. MIB Groups 

   Objects in this MIB are arranged into groups. Each group is related 
   to the Mobile IP entities Mobile Node, Foreign Agent and Home Agent. 
   The Mobile IP entities Mobile Node, Foreign Agent and Home Agent are 
   described in [RFC3344].

5. Security Considerations 

   Assuming that secure network management (such as SNMP v3) is 
   implemented, the objects represented in this MIB do not pose a threat 
   to the security of the network. 

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that 
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write. Such objects may be 
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments. The 
   support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper 
   protection can have a negative effect on network operations. 

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. Even 
   if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), even 
   then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed 
   to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this 
   MIB module. 

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as 
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), 
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for 
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an 
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to 
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate 
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them. 

6. IANA Considerations 

   MIPv4-related standards track MIB modules should be rooted under the 
   mipMIB { mib-2 44 } subtree. 

   There is one new MIPv4 MIB module contained in this document, and the 
   following "IANA Considerations" subsection requests IANA for a new 
   assignment under the mipMIB subtree. 

   New assignments can only be made via a Standards Action as specified 
   in [RFC2434]. 

6.1. IANA Considerations for MIP-UDPTUNNEL-MIB 

   IANA is requested to assign an oid under the mipMIB subtree to the 
   MIP-UDPTUNNEL-MIB module specified in this document. 
    
   Note to the RFC Editor: The editor has used the OID {mipMIB 4} in 
   this document to make compilation and review of the mib module 
   easier. Please replace it with the value assigned by IANA. And remove 
   this note.

APPENDIX A: Todo and open issues 

A.1. Default values 

   In this first version of the mib default values have been defined for 
   all objects. This is good practice, however it's still an open issue 
   which values these default values should have. Except in the case 
   with keepalive timers, these values are not mandated from RFC3519, 
   but are just some assumption of a useful configuration of the Mobile 
   IP UDP tunneling function. 

   However, it differs from the default values used in both the 
   propriatory Cisco and ipUnplugged implementations so it would be 
   useful with some input on the applicability. 

APPENDIX B: Changes in draft versions 

B.1. Changes in draft-ietf-mip4-udptunnel-mib-00 

   Changes compared with draft-sjostrand-mip4-udptunnel-mib-01 which was 
   accepted as WG doc in Prague March 21, 2007.  

   - Minor boilerplate updates, date changes, version numbers, speling 
   errors etc.  

   - Added reference clauses to RFC3519 where applicable 

   - Removed "haUdpTunnelPermitMnForce". It was meant to provide 
   configuration to an ambiguous SHOULD in RFC3519, section 3.1.1 but I 
   think it created more ambiguity than it clarified.  

   - Clarified that IANA shall handle mipMIB OID, in 
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/smi-numbers. IANA considerations 
   chapter written and open issue about OID placement removed.
