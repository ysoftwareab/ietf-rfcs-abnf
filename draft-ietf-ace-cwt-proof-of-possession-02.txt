      Proof-of-Possession Key Semantics for CBOR Web Tokens (CWTs)
               draft-ietf-ace-cwt-proof-of-possession-02

Abstract

   This specification describes how to declare in a CBOR Web Token (CWT)
   that the presenter of the CWT possesses a particular proof-of-
   possession key.  Being able to prove possession of a key is also
   sometimes described as being the holder-of-key.  This specification
   provides equivalent functionality to "Proof-of-Possession Key
   Semantics for JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)" (RFC 7800), but using CBOR and
   CWTs rather than JSON and JWTs.

1.  Introduction

   This specification describes how a CBOR Web Token [CWT] can declare
   that the presenter of the CWT possesses a particular proof-of-
   possession (PoP) key.  Proof of possession of a key is also sometimes
   described as being the holder-of-key.  This specification provides

Internet-Draft      Proof-of-Possession Key for CWTs          March 2018


   equivalent functionality to "Proof-of-Possession Key Semantics for
   JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)" [RFC7800], but using CBOR [RFC7049] and CWTs
   [CWT] rather than JSON [RFC7159] and JWTs [JWT].

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Unless otherwise noted, all the protocol parameter names and values
   are case sensitive.

2.  Terminology

   This specification uses terms defined in the CBOR Web Token [CWT],
   CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) [RFC8152], and Concise
   Binary Object Representation (CBOR) [RFC7049] specifications.

   These terms are defined by this specification:

   Issuer
      Party that creates the CWT and binds its claims to the proof-of-
      possession key.

   Presenter
      Party that proves possession of a private key (for asymmetric key
      cryptography) or secret key (for symmetric key cryptography) to a
      recipient.

   Recipient
      Party that receives the CWT containing the proof-of-possession key
      information from the presenter.

3.  Representations for Proof-of-Possession Keys

   By including a "cnf" (confirmation) claim in a CWT, the issuer of the
   CWT declares that the presenter possesses a particular key and that
   the recipient can cryptographically confirm that the presenter has
   possession of that key.  The value of the "cnf" claim is a CBOR map
   and the members of that map identify the proof-of-possession key.

   The presenter can be identified in one of several ways by the CWT
   depending upon the application requirements.  If the CWT contains a
   "sub" (subject) claim [CWT], the presenter is normally the subject
   identified by the CWT.  (In some applications, the subject identifier



Jones, et al.           Expires September 4, 2018               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft      Proof-of-Possession Key for CWTs          March 2018


   will be relative to the issuer identified by the "iss" (issuer) claim
   [CWT].)  If the CWT contains no "sub" claim, the presenter is
   normally the issuer identified by the CWT using the "iss" claim.  The
   case in which the presenter is the subject of the CWT is analogous to
   Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0
   [OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os] SubjectConfirmation usage.  At least one of
   the "sub" and "iss" claims is typically present in the CWT and some
   use cases may require that both be present.

3.1.  Confirmation Claim

   The "cnf" claim is used in the CWT to contain members used to
   identify the proof-of-possession key.  Other members of the "cnf" map
   may be defined because a proof-of-possession key may not be the only
   means of confirming the authenticity of the token.  This is analogous
   to the SAML 2.0 [OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os] SubjectConfirmation element
   in which a number of different subject confirmation methods can be
   included (including proof-of-possession key information).

   The set of confirmation members that a CWT must contain to be
   considered valid is context dependent and is outside the scope of
   this specification.  Specific applications of CWTs will require
   implementations to understand and process some confirmation members
   in particular ways.  However, in the absence of such requirements,
   all confirmation members that are not understood by implementations
   MUST be ignored.

   This specification establishes the IANA "CWT Confirmation Methods"
   registry for these members in Section 6.2 and registers the members
   defined by this specification.  Other specifications can register
   other members used for confirmation, including other members for
   conveying proof-of-possession keys using different key
   representations.

   The "cnf" claim value MUST represent only a single proof-of-
   possession key.  At most one of the "COSE_Key" and
   "Encrypted_COSE_Key" confirmation values defined below may be
   present.  Note that if an application needs to represent multiple
   proof-of-possession keys in the same CWT, one way for it to achieve
   this is to use other claim names, in addition to "cnf", to hold the
   additional proof-of-possession key information.  These claims could
   use the same syntax and semantics as the "cnf" claim.  Those claims
   would be defined by applications or other specifications and could be
   registered in the IANA "CBOR Web Token Claims" registry
   [IANA.CWT.Claims].

3.2.  Representation of an Asymmetric Proof-of-Possession Key

   When the key held by the presenter is an asymmetric private key, the
   "COSE_Key" member is a COSE_Key [RFC8152] representing the
   corresponding asymmetric public key.  The following example (using
   CBOR diagonstic notation) demonstrates such a declaration in the CWT
   Claims Set of a CWT:

     {
     /iss/ 1 : "coaps://server.example.com",
     /aud/ 3 : "coaps://client.example.org",
     /exp/ 4 : 1361398824,
     /cnf/ 8 :{
       /COSE_Key/ 1 :{
         /kty/ 1 : /EC/ 2,
         /crv/ -1 : /P-256/ 1,
         /x/ -2 : h'd7cc072de2205bdc1537a543d53c60a6acb62eccd890c7fa27c9
                    e354089bbe13',
         /y/ -3 : h'f95e1d4b851a2cc80fff87d8e23f22afb725d535e515d020731e
                    79a3b4e47120'
        }
      }
    }

   The COSE_Key MUST contain the required key members for a COSE_Key of
   that key type and MAY contain other COSE_Key members, including the
   "kid" (Key ID) member.

   The "COSE_Key" member MAY also be used for a COSE_Key representing a
   symmetric key, provided that the CWT is encrypted so that the key is
   not revealed to unintended parties.  The means of encrypting a CWT is
   explained in [CWT].  If the CWT is not encrypted, the symmetric key
   MUST be encrypted as described below.

Internet-Draft      Proof-of-Possession Key for CWTs          March 2018


3.3.  Representation of an Encrypted Symmetric Proof-of-Possession Key

   When the key held by the presenter is a symmetric key, the
   "Encrypted_COSE_Key" member is an encrypted COSE_Key [RFC8152]
   representing the symmetric key encrypted to a key known to the
   recipient using COSE_Encrypt or COSE_Encrypt0.

   The following example (using CBOR diagnostic notation, with
   linebreaks for readability) illustrates a symmetric key that could
   subsequently be encrypted for use in the "Encrypted_COSE_Key" member:

     {
      /kty/ 1 : /Symmetric/ 4,
      /alg/ 3 : /HMAC256/ 5,
      /k/ -1 : h'6684523ab17337f173500e5728c628547cb37df
                 e68449c65f885d1b73b49eae1A0B0C0D0E0F10'
     }

   The COSE_Key representation is used as the plaintext when encrypting
   the key.  The COSE_Key could, for instance, be encrypted using a
   COSE_Encrypt0 representation using the AES-CCM-16-64-128 algorithm.

   The following example CWT Claims Set of a CWT (using CBOR diagnostic
   notation, with linebreaks for readability) illustrates the use of an
   encrypted symmetric key as the "Encrypted_COSE_Key" member value:

  {
   /iss/ 1 : "coaps://server.example.com",
   /sub/ 2 : "24400320",
   /aud/ 3: "s6BhdRkqt3",
   /exp/ 4 : 1311281970,
   /iat/ 5 : 1311280970,
   /cnf/ 8 : {
   /COSE_Encrypt0/ 2 : [
       /protected header / h'A1010A' /{ \alg\ 1:10 \AES-CCM-16-64-128\}/,
       /unprotected header/ { / iv / 5: h'636898994FF0EC7BFCF6D3F95B'},
       /ciphertext/  h'0573318A3573EB983E55A7C2F06CADD0796C9E584F1D0E3E
                       A8C5B052592A8B2694BE9654F0431F38D5BBC8049FA7F13F'
     ]
    }
  }


   The example above was generated with the key:

             h'6162630405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f10'

3.4.  Representation of a Key ID for a Proof-of-Possession Key

   The proof-of-possession key can also be identified by the use of a
   Key ID instead of communicating the actual key, provided the
   recipient is able to obtain the identified key using the Key ID.  In
   this case, the issuer of a CWT declares that the presenter possesses
   a particular key and that the recipient can cryptographically confirm
   proof of possession of the key by the presenter by including a "cnf"
   claim in the CWT whose value is a CBOR map with the CBOR map
   containing a "kid" member identifying the key.

   The following example (using CBOR diagnostic notation) demonstrates
   such a declaration in the CWT Claims Set of a CWT:

     {
      /iss/ 1 : "coaps://server.example.com",
      /aud/ 3 : "coaps://client.example.org",
      /exp/ 4 : 1361398824,
      /cnf/ 8 : {
        /kid/ 2 : h'dfd1aa976d8d4575a0fe34b96de2bfad'
       }
     }

   The content of the "kid" value is application specific.  For
   instance, some applications may choose to use a cryptographic hash of
   the public key value as the "kid" value.

3.5.  Specifics Intentionally Not Specified

   Proof of possession is often demonstrated by having the presenter
   sign a value determined by the recipient using the key possessed by
   the presenter.  This value is sometimes called a "nonce" or a
   "challenge".

   The means of communicating the nonce and the nature of its contents
   are intentionally not described in this specification, as different
   protocols will communicate this information in different ways.
   Likewise, the means of communicating the signed nonce is also not
   specified, as this is also protocol specific.

   Note that another means of proving possession of the key when it is a
   symmetric key is to encrypt the key to the recipient.  The means of
   obtaining a key for the recipient is likewise protocol specific.

4.  Security Considerations

   All of the security considerations that are discussed in [CWT] also
   apply here.  In addition, proof of possession introduces its own
   unique security issues.  Possessing a key is only valuable if it is
   kept secret.  Appropriate means must be used to ensure that
   unintended parties do not learn private key or symmetric key values.

   Applications utilizing proof of possession should also utilize
   audience restriction, as described in Section 4.1.3 of [JWT], as it
   provides different protections.  Proof of possession can be used by
   recipients to reject messages from unauthorized senders.  Audience
   restriction can be used by recipients to reject messages intended for
   different recipients.

   A recipient might not understand the "cnf" claim.  Applications that
   require the proof-of-possession keys communicated with it to be
   understood and processed must ensure that the parts of this
   specification that they use are implemented.

   Proof of possession via encrypted symmetric secrets is subject to
   replay attacks.  This attack can, for example, be avoided when a
   signed nonce or challenge is used since the recipient can use a
   distinct nonce or challenge for each interaction.  Replay can also be
   avoided if a sub-key is derived from a shared secret that is specific
   to the instance of the PoP demonstration.

   As is the case with other information included in a CWT, it is
   necessary to apply data origin authentication and integrity
   protection (via a keyed message digest or a digital signature).  Data
   origin authentication ensures that the recipient of the CWT learns
   about the entity that created the CWT since this will be important
   for any policy decisions.  Integrity protection prevents an adversary
   from changing any elements conveyed within the CWT payload.  Special
   care has to be applied when carrying symmetric keys inside the CWT
   since those not only require integrity protection but also
   confidentiality protection.

   As described in Section 6 (Key Identification) and Appendix D (Notes
   on Key Selection) of [JWS], it is important to make explicit trust
   decisions about the keys.  Proof-of-possession signatures made with
   keys not meeting the application's trust criteria MUST NOT not be
   relied upon.

5.  Privacy Considerations

   A proof-of-possession key can be used as a correlation handle if the
   same key is used with multiple parties.  Thus, for privacy reasons,
   it is recommended that different proof-of-possession keys be used
   when interacting with different parties.

6.  IANA Considerations

   The following registration procedure is used for all the registries
   established by this specification.

   Values are registered on a Specification Required [RFC5226] basis
   after a three-week review period on the cwt-reg-review@ietf.org
   mailing list, on the advice of one or more Designated Experts.
   However, to allow for the allocation of values prior to publication,
   the Designated Experts may approve registration once they are
   satisfied that such a specification will be published.  [[ Note to
   the RFC Editor: The name of the mailing list should be determined in
   consultation with the IESG and IANA.  Suggested name: cwt-reg-
   review@ietf.org. ]]

   Registration requests sent to the mailing list for review should use
   an appropriate subject (e.g., "Request to Register CWT Confirmation
   Method: example").  Registration requests that are undetermined for a
   period longer than 21 days can be brought to the IESG's attention
   (using the iesg@ietf.org mailing list) for resolution.

   Criteria that should be applied by the Designated Experts include
   determining whether the proposed registration duplicates existing
   functionality, determining whether it is likely to be of general
   applicability or whether it is useful only for a single application,
   and evaluating the security properties of the item being registered
   and whether the registration makes sense.

   It is suggested that multiple Designated Experts be appointed who are
   able to represent the perspectives of different applications using
   this specification in order to enable broadly informed review of
   registration decisions.  In cases where a registration decision could
   be perceived as creating a conflict of interest for a particular
   Expert, that Expert should defer to the judgment of the other
   Experts.

6.1.  CBOR Web Token Claims Registration

   This specification registers the "cnf" claim in the IANA "CBOR Web
   Token Claims" registry [IANA.CWT.Claims] established by [CWT].

6.1.1.  Registry Contents

   o  Claim Name: "cnf"
   o  Claim Description: Confirmation
   o  JWT Claim Name: "cnf"
   o  Claim Key: TBD (maybe 8)
   o  Claim Value Type(s): map
   o  Change Controller: IESG
   o  Specification Document(s): Section 3.1 of [[ this document ]]

6.2.  CWT Confirmation Methods Registry

   This specification establishes the IANA "CWT Confirmation Methods"
   registry for CWT "cnf" member values.  The registry records the
   confirmation method member and a reference to the specification that
   defines it.

6.2.1.  Registration Template

   Confirmation Method Name:
      The human-readable name requested (e.g., "kid").

   Confirmation Method Description:
      Brief description of the confirmation method (e.g., "Key
      Identifier").

   JWT Confirmation Method Name:
      Claim Name of the equivalent JWT confirmation method value, as
      registered in [IANA.JWT.Claims].  CWT claims should normally have
      a corresponding JWT claim.  If a corresponding JWT claim would not
      make sense, the Designated Experts can choose to accept
      registrations for which the JWT Claim Name is listed as "N/A".

Document History

   [[ to be removed by the RFC Editor before publication as an RFC ]]

   -02

   o  Changed "typically" to "often" when describing ways of performing
      proof of possession.

   o  Changed b64 to hex encoding in an example.

   o  Changed to using the RFC 8174 boilerplate instead of the RFC 2119
      boilerplate.

   -01

   o  Now uses CBOR diagnostic notation for the examples.

   o  Added a table summarizing the "cnf" names, keys, and value types.

   o  Addressed some of Jim Schaad's feedback on -00.
