                               Abstract

   This document describes new ECC groups for use in IKE [IKE]
   in addition to the Oakley groups included therein.  These groups
   are defined to align IKE with other ECC implementations and standards,
   and in addition, some of them provide higher strength than the Oakley
   groups. It should be noted that this document is not self-contained.
   It uses the notations and definitions of [IKE].

INTERNET-DRAFT       Additional ECC Groups For IKE            May 30, 2000


1.  Introduction

This document describes default groups for use in elliptic curve Diffie-
Hellman in IKE in addition to the Oakley groups included in [IKE].
The document assumes that the reader is familiar with the IKE protocol
and the concept of Oakley Groups, as defined in RFC 2409 [IKE].

RFC2409 [IKE] defines five standard Oakley Groups - three modular exponen-
tiation groups and two elliptic curve groups over GF[2^N]. One modular exp-
onentiation group (768 bits - Oakley Group 1) is mandatory for all implemen-
tations to support, while the other four are optional.  Both elliptic curve 
groups (Oakley Groups 3 and 4) are defined over GF[2^N] with N composite.

Implementations have shown that users of elliptic curve groups can signifi-
cantly improve their performance by using groups other than the Oakley Groups
1, 2, or 5. The purpose of this document is to expand the options available 
to implementers of elliptic curve groups by adding four new groups.  The 
reasons for adding these new groups include the following.

- The groups proposed encourage alignment with other elliptic curve
  standards. Oakley Groups 3 and 4 were defined prior to the availability of
  other elliptic curve standards and they are therefore not aligned with
  other efforts.  Specifically, unlike Oakley groups 3 and 4, the proposed
  groups use base points whose order is prime (as required by IEEE [P1363]
  and ANSI [X9.62, X9.63]), they use base points whose prime order is
  greater than 2^160 (as required by ANSI [X9.62, X9.63]), and they use the
  octet string representation for points recommended in IEEE [P1363] and
  ANSI [X9.62, X9.63].

- Two of the new groups proposed offer higher strength than the existing
  Oakley Groups. As computing power increases and other standards such as
  the AES are specified it becomes increasingly desirable to make higher
  strength groups available to implementers. 

- The four groups proposed in this document use elliptic curves over
  GF[2^N] with N prime, unlike the existing Oakley Groups. This addresses
  concerns expressed by many experts regarding curves defined over GF[2^N]
  with N composite -- concerns highlighted by the recent attack on such
  curves due to Gaudry, Hess, and Smart [WEIL].

- The four groups proposed are amongst those recently standardized by NIST
  in FIPS 186-2 [DSS] and the SECG in SEC2 [SEC2].

These groups could also be defined using the New Group Mode but including
them in this RFC will encourage interoperability of IKE implementations
based upon elliptic curve groups. This is particularly critical since the
available Oakley Groups based on elliptic curves are insufficient for the
reasons given above.  In addition, the availability of standardized groups
will result in optimizations for a particular curve and field size as 
well as allowing precomputation that could result in faster implementations.

The groups proposed here have been assigned identifiers by IANA [IANA]. Thus 
the full list of assigned values for the Group Description class within IKE 
is the following. (The first four groups may be found in RFC 2409 [IKE];
the last four groups are defined in this document.)

  Group Description                         Value
  -----------------                         -----
  Default 768-bit MODP group                  1  
  Alternate 1024-bit MODP group               2  
  EC2N group over GF[2^155]                   3  
  EC2N group over GF[2^185]                   4  
  Reserved to IANA                            5  
  EC2N group over GF[2^163] (Section 2.1)     6  
  EC2N group over GF[2^163] (Section 2.2)     7  
  EC2N group over GF[2^283] (Section 2.3)     8  
  EC2N group over GF[2^283] (Section 2.4)     9  

In summary, due to the performance advantages of elliptic curve groups in
IKE implementations and the need for standardized groups as alternatives
to Oakley Groups 3 and 4, this document defines four new groups based on
elliptic curve groups. The groups are defined at two field sizes: GF[2^163]
and GF[2^283]. These field sizes correspond to 80-bit and 128-bit symmetric
key strengths, 1,024-bit and 3,044-bit Diffie-Hellman, respectively. Two
curves are defined at each strength - a Koblitz curve that enables espe-
cially efficient implementations due to the special structure of the curve
[Kob, NSA] and a curve chosen verifiably at random (as defined in ANSI 
[X9.62]). The groups are assigned numbers numbers 6 to 9 by IANA [IANA].


2. Additional Oakley Groups

The notation adopted in RFC2409 [IKE] is used below to describe the new 
Oakley Groups proposed.


2.1 Sixth Group

IKE implementations SHOULD support a EC2N group with the following charac-
teristics. This group is assigned id 6 (six). The curve is based on the
Galois Field GF[2^163]. The field size is 163. The irreducible polynomial
used to represent the field is:
           u^163 + u^7 + u^6 + u^3 + 1.
The equation for the elliptic curve is:
           y^2 + xy = x^3 + ax^2 + b.

Specifically the group is defined by the following characteristics:

Field size:
  163

Irreducible polynomial:
  0x0800000000000000000000000000000000000000C9

Group Curve a:
  0x07B6882CAAEFA84F9554FF8428BD88E246D2782AE2

Group Curve b:
  0x0713612DCDDCB40AAB946BDA29CA91F73AF958AFD9

Group Generator point P (compressed): 
  0x030369979697AB43897789566789567F787A7876A654

Group Generator point P (uncompressed): 
  0x040369979697AB43897789566789567F787A7876A654
      00435EDB42EFAFB2989D51FEFCE3C80988F41FF883

The order of the base point P defined above is the prime:
  0x03FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF48AAB689C29CA710279B

The group order is twice this prime.

The group was chosen verifiably at random using SHA-1 as specified in
[X9.62] from the seed:
  0x24B7B137C8A14D696E6768756151756FD0DA2E5C

However, for historical reasons, the method to generate the group from the
seed differs slightly from the method described in [X9.62]. Specifically
the coefficient Group Curve b produced from the seed is the reverse
of the coefficient that would have been produced by the method described
in [X9.62].

The data in the KE payload when using this group is the octet string
representation specified in ANSI X9.62, ANSI X9.63, FIPS 186-2, and IEEE 
P1363 of the point on the curve chosen by taking the randomly chosen secret 
Ka and computing Ka*P, where * is the repetition of the group addition and 
double operations.  Note that this payload differs from the payload specified
for groups 3 and 4 - it is aligned instead with other recent standardization
efforts in ECC.

This group corresponds to the curve sect163r1 in SEC 2 [SEC2].  It is also
recommended in ANSI X9.63 [X9.63] and echeck [ECHECK].

teristics. This group is assigned id 7 (seven). The curve is based on the
Galois Field GF[2^163]. The field size is 163. The irreducible polynomial
used to represent the field is:
           u^163 + u^7 + u^6 + u^3 + 1.
The equation for the elliptic curve is:
           y^2 + xy = x^3 + ax^2 + b.

Specifically the group is defined by the following characteristics:

Field size:
  163

Irreducible polynomial:
  0x0800000000000000000000000000000000000000C9

      0289070FB05D38FF58321F2E800536D538CCDAA3D9

The order of the base point P above is the prime:
  0x04000000000000000000020108A2E0CC0D99F8A5EF

The group order is twice this prime.

The data in the KE payload when using this group is the octet string
representation specified in ANSI X9.62, ANSI X9.63, FIPS 186-2, and IEEE 
P1363 of the point on the curve chosen by taking the randomly chosen secret 
Ka and computing Ka*P, where * is the repetition of the group addition and 
double operations.  Note that the format of this data is identical to the
format used with Oakley Group 6 (six).

This group corresponds to the curve K-163 in FIPS 186-2 [DSS] and sect163k1
in SEC 2 [SEC2].  It is also recommended in ANSI [X9.63], echeck [ECHECK],
and WAP [WTLS].

teristics. This group is assigned id 8 (eight). The curve is based on the
Galois Field GF[2^283]. The field size is 283. The irreducible polynomial
used to represent the field is:
           u^283 + u^12 + u^7 + u^5 + 1.
The equation for the elliptic curve is:
           y^2 + xy = x^3 + ax^2 + b.

Specifically the group is defined by the following characteristics:

Field size:
  283

Irreducible polynomial:
  0x0800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000010A1

  0x03FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEF90399660FC938A90165B042A7CEFADB307

The group order is twice this prime.

The group was chosen verifiably at random in normal basis
representation using SHA-1 as specified in [X9.62] from the seed:
  0x77E2B07370EB0F832A6DD5B62DFC88CD06BB84BE

The data in the KE payload when using this group is the octet string
representation specified in ANSI X9.62, ANSI X9.63, FIPS 186-2, and IEEE

format used with Oakley Group 6 (six).

This group corresponds to the curve B-283 (in the polynomial basis) in FIPS 
186-2 [DSS] and sect283r1 in SEC 2 [SEC2].  It is also recommended in ANSI

3. Security Considerations

Since this document proposes new groups for use within IKE, many of the
security considerations contained within RFC 2409 apply here as well.

Two of the groups proposed in this document (eighth and ninth groups)
offer higher strength than those proposed in RFC 2409, since they are
defined over field size of 283 bits.  In addition, since all the new
groups are defined over GF[2^N] with N prime, they address the concerns
expressed regarding the elliptic curve groups included in RFC 2409, which
are curves defined over GF[2^N] with N composite.  The work of Gaudry,
Hess, and Smart [WEIL] reveal some of the weaknesses in such groups.
