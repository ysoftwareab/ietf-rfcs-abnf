Abstract

    Stream Control Transmission Protocol [RFC2960] provides transparent
    multi-homing to its upper layer users. This multi-homing is
    accomplished through the passing of address parameters in the
    initial setup message used by SCTP. In an IPv4 network all addresses
    are passed with no consideration for their scope and routeablility.
    In a IPv6 network special considerations MUST be made to properly
    bring up associations between SCTP endpoints that have IPv6
    [RFC2460] addresses bound within their association.  This document
    defines those considerations and enumerates general rules
    that an SCTP endpoint MUST use in formulating both the INIT and
    INIT-ACK chunks.

    [RFC2460] addresses bound within their association.  This document
    defines those considerations and enumerates general rules
    that an SCTP endpoint MUST use in formulating both the INIT and
    INIT-ACK chunks.

    The emphasis in the rules laid out in this document are to prevent
    an SCTP endpoint from listing an IPv6 address that is outside of its
    routeable scope to a peer endpoint. This will prevent black-hole
    conditions that may cause the unexpected failure of SCTP associations.

2. Conventions

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, NOT RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when
   they appear in this document, are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].


3. Special rules for IPv6 address scoping

    When the ULP requests establishment of an SCTP association to a
    IPv6 destination address, the following considerations apply:

    - the requested destination address will be accompanied
      by a locally-significant "zone identifier" [scoped-addr-arch].

    - the source address in the initial IPv6 packet (the packet
      carrying the INIT) MUST be an address belonging to the 
      specified destination zone.

    - the INIT chunk MUST include all of, and only, the initiator's bound
      addresses belonging to the destination zone and all larger,
      encompassing zones, with the optional exception of the source address.


    The receiver of an INIT will identify the relevant zone by the 
    scope of the source address and the arrival interface. In
    choosing addresses to place in the INIT-ACK the following 
    considerations apply:

    - the receiver of the INIT will use the locally-significant 
      "zone identifier" [scoped-addr-arch] to scope the addresses
      listed in the INIT-ACK.

    - the source address in the initial IPv6 packet (the packet
      carrying the INIT-ACK) MUST be an address belonging to the 
      destination zone. 

    - the INIT-ACK chunk MUST include all of, and only, the initiator's 
      bound addresses belonging to the destination zone and all larger,
      encompassing zones, with the optional exception of the source address.
