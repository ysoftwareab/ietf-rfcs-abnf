Abstract 
   This document analyzes security issues around implementation and 
   use of the Direct Data Placement Protocol(DDP) and Remote Direct 
   Memory Access Protocol (RDMAP). It first defines an architectural 
   model for an RDMA Network Interface Card (RNIC), which can 
   implement DDP or RDMAP and DDP. The document reviews various 
   attacks against the resources defined in the architectural model 
   and the countermeasures that can be used to protect the system. 
   Attacks are grouped into spoofing, tampering, information 
   disclosure, denial of service, and elevation of privilege. 
   Finally, the document concludes with a summary of security 
   services for DDP and RDMAP, such as IPsec.

1  Introduction 

   RDMA enables new levels of flexibility when communicating between 
   two parties compared to current conventional networking practice 
   (e.g. a stream-based model or datagram model). This flexibility 
   brings new security issues that must be carefully understood when 
   designing Upper Layer Protocols (ULPs) utilizing RDMA and when 
   implementing RDMA-aware NICs (RNICs). Note that for the purposes 
   of this security analysis, an RNIC may implement RDMAP and DDP, 
   or just DDP. Also, a ULP may be an application or it may be a 
   middleware library. 

   The document first develops an architectural model that is 
   relevant for the security analysis - it details components, 
   resources, and system properties that may be attacked in Section 
   2. The document uses Local Peer to represent the RDMA/DDP 
   protocol implementation on the local end of a Stream. The local 
   Upper-Layer-Protocol (ULP) is used to represent the application 
   or middle-ware layer above the Local Peer. The document does not 
   attempt to differentiate between a Remote Peer and a Remote ULP 
   (an RDMA/DDP protocol implementation on the remote end of a 
   Stream versus the application on the remote end) for several 
   reasons: often the source of the attack is difficult to know for 
   sure; and regardless of the source, the mitigations required of 
   the Local Peer or local ULP are the same. Thus the document 
   generically refers to a Remote Peer rather than trying to further 
   delineate the attacker. 

   The document then defines what resources a local ULP may share 
   across Streams and what resources the local ULP may share with 
   the Remote Peer across Streams in Section 3.  

   Intentional sharing of resources between multiple Streams may 
   imply some level of trust between the Streams. However, some 
   types of resource sharing have unmitigated security attacks which 
   would mandate not sharing a specific type of resource unless 
   there is some level of trust between the Streams sharing 
   resources. 

   This document defines a new term, "Partial Mutual Trust" to 
   address this concept: 

        Partial Mutual Trust - a collection of RDMAP/DDP Streams, 
        which represent the local and remote end points of the 
        Stream, which are willing to assume that the Streams from 
        the collection will not perform malicious attacks against 
        any of the other Streams in the collection. 

   ULPs have explicit control of which collection of endpoints is in 
   a Partial Mutual Trust collection through tools discussed in 
   Section 13 Appendix C: Partial Trust Taxonomy.

   Internet-Draft             RDDP/RDMAP Security        March, 2006 

   An untrusted peer relationship is appropriate when a ULP wishes 
   to ensure that it will be robust and uncompromised even in the 
   face of a deliberate attack by its peer. For example, a single 
   ULP that concurrently supports multiple unrelated Streams (e.g. a 
   server) would presumably treat each of its peers as an untrusted 
   peer. For a collection of Streams which share Partial Mutual 
   Trust, the assumption is that any Stream not in the collection is 
   untrusted. For the untrusted peer, a brief list of capabilities 
   is enumerated in Section 4.  

   The rest of the document is focused on analyzing attacks and 
   recommending specific mitigations to the attacks. Attacks are 
   categorized into attacks mitigated by LLP mechanisms, attacks 
   initiated by Remote Peers, and attacks initiated by Local Peers. 
   For each attack, possible countermeasures are reviewed. 

   ULPs within a host are divided into two categories - Privileged 
   and Non-Privileged. Both ULP types can send and receive data and 
   request resources. The key differences between the two are: 

        The Privileged ULP is trusted by the local system to not 
        maliciously attack the operating environment, but it is not 
        trusted to optimize resource allocation globally. For 
        example, the Privileged ULP could be a kernel ULP, thus the 
        kernel presumably has in some way vetted the ULP before 
        allowing it to execute.  

        A Non-Privileged ULP's capabilities are a logical sub-set of 
        the Privileged ULP's. It is assumed by the local system that 
        a Non-Privileged ULP is untrusted. All Non-Privileged ULP 
        interactions with the RNIC Engine that could affect other 
        ULPs need to be done through a trusted intermediary that can 
        verify the Non-Privileged ULP requests. 

   If all recommended mitigations are in place the implemented usage 
   models, the RDMAP/DDP protocol can be shown to not expose any new 
   security vulnerabilities.

2  Architectural Model 

   This section describes an RDMA architectural reference model that 
   is used as security issues are examined. It introduces the 
   components of the model, the resources that can be attacked, the 
   types of interactions possible between components and resources, 
   and the system properties which must be preserved. 

   Figure 1 shows the components comprising the architecture and the 
   interfaces where potential security attacks could be launched. 
   External attacks can be injected into the system from a ULP that 
   sits above the RNIC Interface or from the network. 

   The intent here is to describe high level components and 
   capabilities which affect threat analysis, and not focus on 
   specific implementation options. Also note that the architectural 
   model is an abstraction, and an actual implementation may choose 
   to subdivide its components along different boundary lines than 
   defined here. For example, the Privileged Resource Manager may be 
   partially or completely encapsulated in the Privileged ULP. 
   Regardless, it is expected that the security analysis of the 
   potential threats and countermeasures still apply. 

   Note that the model below is derived from several specific RDMA 
   implementations. A few of note is [VERBS-RDMAC], [VERBS-RDMAC-
   Overview], and [INFINIBAND].

2.1  Components 

   The components shown in Figure 1 - RDMA Security Model are: 

       *   RDMA Network Interface Controller Engine (RNIC) - the 
           component that implements the RDMA protocol and/or DDP 
           protocol. 

       *   Privileged Resource Manager - the component responsible 
           for managing and allocating resources associated with the 
           RNIC Engine. The Resource Manager does not send or 
           receive data. Note that whether the Resource Manager is 
           an independent component, part of the RNIC, or part of 
           the ULP is implementation dependent.  

       *   Privileged ULP - See Section 1 Introduction for a 
           definition of Privileged ULP. The local host 
           infrastructure can enable the Privileged ULP to map a 
           data buffer directly from the RNIC Engine to the host 


   J. Pinkerton, et al.    Expires - September, 2006         [Page 7] 
   Internet-Draft             RDDP/RDMAP Security        March, 2006 

           through the RNIC Interface, but it does not allow the 
           Privileged ULP to directly consume RNIC Engine resources. 

       *   Non-Privileged ULP - See Section 1 Introduction for a 
           definition of Non-Privileged ULP.  

   A design goal of the DDP and RDMAP protocols is to allow, under 
   constrained conditions, Non-Privileged ULP to send and receive 
   data directly to/from the RDMA Engine without Privileged Resource 
   Manager intervention - while ensuring that the host remains 
   secure. Thus, one of the primary goals of this document is to 
   analyze this usage model for the enforcement that is required in 
   the RNIC Engine to ensure the system remains secure. 

   DDP supports both untagged and tagged buffers.  Tagged buffers 
   allow the Data Sink ULP to be indifferent to what order (or in 
   what messages) the Data Source sent the data, or what order 
   packets are received in.  Typically tagged data can be used for 
   payload transfer, while untagged is best used for control 
   messages.  However each upper layer protocol can determine the 
   optimal use of tagged and untagged messages for itself.  This 
   document will discuss when Data Source flexibility is of benefit 
   to applications 

   Note that in DDP there are two mechanisms for transferring data. 
   These two data transfer mechanisms are also enabled through 
   RDMAP, with additional control semantics: 

       *   Untagged data transfer - the Data Source payload simply 
           consumes the first buffer in a queue of buffers that are 
           in Data Sink specified order (commonly referred to as the 
           Receive Queue), and  

       *   Tagged data transfer - the Data Source explicitly states 
           which destination buffer is targeted, through use of an 
           STag. STag based transfers allow the Data Sink ULP to be 
           indifferent to what order (or in what messages) the Data 
           Source sent the data, or what order packets are received 
           in. 

   For DDP the two forms correspond to Untagged and Tagged DDP 
   Messages, respectively. For RDMAP the two forms correspond to 
   Send Type Messages and RDMA Messages (either RDMA Read or RDMA 
   Write Messages), respectively. Typically tagged data can be used 
   for payload transfer, while untagged is best used for control 
   messages.  However each upper layer protocol can determine the 
   optimal use of tagged and untagged messages for itself. See 
   [APPLICABILITY] for more information on application applicability 
   for the two transfer mechanisms.  

   The host interfaces that could be exercised include:

   Internet-Draft             RDDP/RDMAP Security        March, 2006 

       *   Privileged Control Interface - A Privileged Resource 
           Manager uses the RNIC Interface to allocate and manage 
           RNIC Engine resources, control the state within the RNIC 
           Engine, and monitor various events from the RNIC Engine. 
           It also uses this interface to act as a proxy for some 
           operations that a Non-Privileged ULP may require (after 
           performing appropriate countermeasures). 

       *   ULP Control Interface - An ULP uses this interface to the 
           Privileged Resource Manager to allocate RNIC Engine 
           resources. The Privileged Resource Manager implements 
           countermeasures to ensure that if the Non-Privileged ULP 
           launches an attack it can prevent the attack from 
           affecting other ULPs. 

       *   Non-Privileged Data Transfer Interface - A Non-Privileged 
           ULP uses this interface to initiate and to check the 
           status of data transfer operations.  

       *   Privileged Data Transfer Interface - A superset of the 
           functionality provided by the Non-Privileged Data 
           Transfer Interface. The ULP is allowed to directly 
           manipulate RNIC Engine mapping resources to map an STag 
           to a ULP data buffer. 

   If Internet control messages, such as ICMP, ARP, RIPv4, etc. are 
   processed by the RNIC Engine, the threat analyses for those 
   protocols is also applicable, but outside the scope of this 
   document. 

2.2  Resources 

   This section describes the primary resources in the RNIC Engine 
   that could be affected if under attack. For RDMAP, all of the 
   defined resources apply. For DDP, all of the resources except the 
   RDMA Read Queue apply. 

2.2.1  Stream Context Memory  

   The state information for each Stream is maintained in memory, 
   which could be located in a number of places - on the NIC, inside 
   RAM attached to the NIC, in host memory, or in any combination of 
   the three, depending on the implementation.  

   Stream Context Memory includes state associated with Data 
   Buffers. For Tagged Buffers, this includes how STag names, Data 
   Buffers, and Page Translation Tables (see section 2.2.3) 
   interrelate. It also includes the list of Untagged Data Buffers 
   posted for reception of Untagged Messages (commonly called the 
   Receive Queue), and a list of operations to perform to send data 
   (commonly called the Send Queue).

2.2.2  Data Buffers  

   As mentioned previously, there are two different ways to expose a 
   local ULP's data buffers for data transfer; Untagged Data 
   Transfer - a buffer can be exposed for receiving RDMAP Send Type 
   Messages (a.k.a. DDP Untagged Messages) on DDP Queue zero - or 
   Tagged Data Transfer - the buffer can be exposed for remote 
   access through STags (a.k.a. DDP Tagged Messages). This 
   distinction is important because the attacks and the 
   countermeasures used to protect against the attack are different 
   depending on the method for exposing the buffer to the network. 

   For the purposes of the security discussion, for Tagged Data 
   Transfer a single logical Data Buffer is exposed with a single 
   Stag on a given Stream. Actual implementations may support 
   scatter/gather capabilities to enable multiple physical data 
   buffers to be accessed with a single STag, but from a threat 
   analysis perspective it is assumed that a single STag enables 
   access to a single logical Data Buffer. 

   In any event, it is the responsibility of the Privileged Resource 
   Manager to ensure that no STag can be created that exposes memory 
   that the consumer had no authority to expose. 

   A data buffer has specific access rights. The local ULP can 
   control whether a data buffer is exposed for local only, or local 
   and remote access, and assign specific access privileges (read, 
   write, read and write) on a per Stream basis.  

   For DDP, when an STag is advertised, the Remote Peer is 
   presumably given write access rights to the data (otherwise there 
   was not much point to the advertisement). For RDMAP, when a ULP 
   advertises an STag, it can enable write-only, read-only, or both 
   write and read access rights. 

   Similarly, some ULPs may wish to provide a single buffer with 
   different access rights on a per-Stream basis. For example, some 
   Streams may have read-only access, some may have remote read and 
   write access, while on other Streams only the local ULP/Local 
   Peer is allowed access. 

2.2.3  Page Translation Tables 

   Page Translation Tables are the structures used by the RNIC to be 
   able to access ULP memory for data transfer operations. Even 
   though these structures are called "Page" Translation Tables, 
   they may not reference a page at all - conceptually they are used 
   to map a ULP address space representation (e.g. a virtual 
   address) of a buffer to the physical addresses that are used by 
   the RNIC Engine to move data. If on a specific system a mapping 
   is not used, then a subset of the attacks examined may be 



   J. Pinkerton, et al.    Expires - September, 2006        [Page 10] 
   Internet-Draft             RDDP/RDMAP Security        March, 2006 

   appropriate. Note that the Page Translation Table may or may not 
   be a shared resource. 

2.2.4  Protection Domain (PD) 

   A Protection Domain (PD) is a local construct to the RDMA 
   implementation, and never visible over the wire. Protection 
   Domains are assigned to two of the resources of concern, Stream 
   Context Memory and STags associated with Page Translation Table 
   entries and data buffers. A correct implementation of a 
   Protection Domain requires that resources which belong to a given 
   Protection Domain can not be used on a resource belonging to 
   another Protection Domain, because Protection Domain membership 
   is checked by the RNIC prior to taking any action involving such 
   a resource. Protection Domains are therefore used to ensure that 
   an STag can only be used to access an associated data buffer on 
   one or more Streams that are associated with the same Protection 
   Domain as the specific STag. 

   If an implementation chooses to not share resources between 
   Streams, it is recommended that each Stream be associated with 
   its own, unique Protection Domain. If an implementation chooses 
   to allow resource sharing, it is recommended that Protection 
   Domain be limited to the collection of Streams that have Partial 
   Mutual Trust with each other. 

   Note that a ULP (either Privileged or Non-Privileged) can 
   potentially have multiple Protection Domains. This could be used, 
   for example, to ensure that multiple clients of a server do not 
   have the ability to corrupt each other. The server would allocate 
   a Protection Domain per client to ensure that resources covered 
   by the Protection Domain could not be used by another (untrusted) 
   client.  

2.2.5  STag Namespace and Scope 

   The DDP specification defines a 32-bit namespace for the STag. 
   Implementations may vary in terms of the actual number of STags 
   that are supported. In any case, this is a bounded resource that 
   can come under attack. Depending upon STag namespace allocation 
   algorithms, the actual name space to attack may be significantly 
   less than 2^32. 

   The scope of an STag is the set of DDP/RDMAP Streams on which the 
   STag is valid. If an STag is valid on a particular DDP/RDMAP 
   Stream, then that stream can modify the buffer, subject to the 
   access rights that the stream has for the STag (see Section 2.2.2 
   Data Buffers for additional information).  

   The analysis presented in this document assumes two mechanisms 
   for limiting the scope of Streams for which the STag is valid: 



   J. Pinkerton, et al.    Expires - September, 2006        [Page 11] 
   Internet-Draft             RDDP/RDMAP Security        March, 2006 

           *   Protection Domain scope. The STag is valid if used on 
               any Stream within a specific Protection Domain, and 
               is invalid if used on any Stream that is not a member 
               of the Protection Domain. 

           *   Single Stream scope. The STag is valid on a single 
               Stream, regardless of what the Stream association is 
               to a Protection Domain. If used on any other Stream, 
               it is invalid. 

2.2.6  Completion Queues 

   Completion Queues (CQ) are used in this document to conceptually 
   represent how the RNIC Engine notifies the ULP about the 
   completion of the transmission of data, or the completion of the 
   reception of data through the Data Transfer Interface 
   (specifically for Untagged Data Transfer - Tagged Data Transfer 
   can not cause a completion to occur). Because there could be many 
   transmissions or receptions in flight at any one time, 
   completions are modeled as a queue rather than a single event. An 
   implementation may also use the Completion Queue to notify the 
   ULP of other activities, for example, the completion of a mapping 
   of an STag to a specific ULP buffer. Completion Queues may be 
   shared by a group of Streams, or may be designated to handle a 
   specific Stream's traffic. Limiting Completion Queue association 
   to one, or a small number of RDMAP/DDP Streams can prevent 
   several forms of attacks by sharply limiting the scope of the 
   attack's effect.  

   Some implementations may allow this queue to be manipulated 
   directly by both Non-Privileged and Privileged ULPs. 

2.2.7  Asynchronous Event Queue  

   The Asynchronous Event Queue is a queue from the RNIC to the 
   Privileged Resource Manager of bounded size. It is used by the 
   RNIC to notify the host of various events which might require 
   management action, including protocol violations, Stream state 
   changes, local operation errors, low water marks on receive 
   queues, and possibly other events.  

   The Asynchronous Event Queue is a resource that can be attacked 
   because Remote or Local Peers and/or ULPs can cause events to 
   occur which have the potential of overflowing the queue.  

   Note that an implementation is at liberty to implement the 
   functions of the Asynchronous Event Queue in a variety of ways, 
   including multiple queues or even simple callbacks. All 
   vulnerabilities identified are intended to apply regardless of 
   the implementation of the Asynchronous Event Queue. For example, 
   a callback function may be viewed as simply a very short queue.

2.2.8  RDMA Read Request Queue  

   The RDMA Read Request Queue is the memory that holds state 
   information for one or more RDMA Read Request Messages that have 
   arrived, but for which the RDMA Read Response Messages have not 
   yet been completely sent. Because potentially more than one RDMA 
   Read Request can be outstanding at one time, the memory is 
   modeled as a queue of bounded size. Some implementations may 
   enable sharing of a single RDMA Read Request Queue across 
   multiple Streams. 

2.3  RNIC Interactions  

   With RNIC resources and interfaces defined, it is now possible to 
   examine the interactions supported by the generic RNIC functional 
   interfaces through each of the 3 interfaces - Privileged Control 
   Interface, Privileged Data Interface, and Non-Privileged Data 
   Interface. As mentioned previously in Section 2.1 Components, 
   there are two data transfer mechanisms to be examined - Untagged 
   data transfer and Tagged data transfer. 

2.3.1  Privileged Control Interface Semantics 

   Generically, the Privileged Control Interface controls the RNIC's 
   allocation, deallocation, and initialization of RNIC global 
   resources. This includes allocation and deallocation of Stream 
   Context Memory, Page Translation Tables, STag names, Completion 
   Queues, RDMA Read Request Queues, and Asynchronous Event Queues.  

   The Privileged Control Interface is also typically used for 
   managing Non-Privileged ULP resources for the Non-Privileged ULP 
   (and possibly for the Privileged ULP as well). This includes 
   initialization and removal of Page Translation Table resources, 
   and managing RNIC events (possibly managing all events for the 
   Asynchronous Event Queue). 

2.3.2  Non-Privileged Data Interface Semantics 

   The Non-Privileged Data Interface enables data transfer (transmit 
   and receive) but does not allow initialization of the Page 
   Translation Table resources. However, once the Page Translation 
   Table resources have been initialized, the interface may enable a 
   specific STag mapping to be enabled and disabled by directly 
   communicating with the RNIC, or create an STag mapping for a 
   buffer that has been previously initialized in the RNIC.  

   For RDMAP, ULP data can be sent by one of the previously 
   described data transfer mechanisms - Untagged data transfer or 
   Tagged Data Transfer. Three RDMAP data transfer mechanisms are 
   defined, one using Untagged data transfer (Send Type Messages), 
   and one using Tagged data transfer (RDMA Read Responses and RDMA 
   Writes). ULP data reception through RDMAP can be done by 


   J. Pinkerton, et al.    Expires - September, 2006        [Page 13] 
   Internet-Draft             RDDP/RDMAP Security        March, 2006 

   receiving Send Type Messages into buffers that have been posted 
   on the Receive Queue or Shared Receive Queue. Thus a Receive 
   Queue or Shared Receive Queue can only be affected by Untagged 
   data transfer. Data reception can also be done by receiving RDMA 
   Write and RDMA Read Response Messages into buffers that have 
   previously been exposed for external write access through 
   advertisement of an STag (i.e. Tagged data transfer). 
   Additionally, to cause ULP data to be pulled (read) across the 
   network, RDMAP uses an RDMA Read Request Message (which only 
   contains RDMAP control information necessary to access the ULP 
   buffer to be read), to cause an RDMA Read Response Message to be 
   generated that contains the ULP data. 

   For DDP, transmitting data means sending DDP Tagged or Untagged 
   Messages. For data reception, for DDP it can receive Untagged 
   Messages into buffers that have been posted on the Receive Queue 
   or Shared Receive Queue. It can also receive Tagged DDP Messages 
   into buffers that have previously been exposed for external write 
   access through advertisement of an STag. 

   Completion of data transmission or reception generally entails 
   informing the ULP of the completed work by placing completion 
   information on the Completion Queue. For data reception, only an 
   Untagged data transfer can cause completion information to be put 
   in the Completion Queue. 

2.3.3  Privileged Data Interface Semantics 

   The Privileged Data Interface semantics are a superset of the 
   Non-Privileged Data Transfer semantics. The interface can do 
   everything defined in the prior section, as well as 
   create/destroy buffer to STag mappings directly. This generally 
   entails initialization or clearing of Page Translation Table 
   state in the RNIC. 

2.3.4  Initialization of RNIC Data Structures for Data Transfer  

   Initialization of the mapping between an STag and a Data Buffer 
   can be viewed in the abstract as two separate operations:  

       a.  Initialization of the allocated Page Translation Table 
           entries with the location of the Data Buffer, and 

       b.  Initialization of a mapping from an allocated STag name 
           to a set of Page Translation Table entry(s) or partial-
           entries.  

   Note that an implementation may not have a Page Translation Table 
   (i.e. it may support a direct mapping between an STag and a Data 
   Buffer). In this case threats and mitigations associated with the 
   Page Translation Table are not relevant. 



   J. Pinkerton, et al.    Expires - September, 2006        [Page 14] 
   Internet-Draft             RDDP/RDMAP Security        March, 2006 

   Initialization of the contents of the Page Translation Table can 
   be done by either the Privileged ULP or by the Privileged 
   Resource Manager as a proxy for the Non-Privileged ULP. By 
   definition the Non-Privileged ULP is not trusted to directly 
   manipulate the Page Translation Table. In general the concern is 
   that the Non-Privileged ULP may try to maliciously initialize the 
   Page Translation Table to access a buffer for which it does not 
   have permission.  

   The exact resource allocation algorithm for the Page Translation 
   Table is outside the scope of this document. It may be allocated 
   for a specific Data Buffer, or be allocated as a pooled resource 
   to be consumed by potentially multiple Data Buffers, or be 
   managed in some other way. This document attempts to abstract 
   implementation dependent issues, and group them into higher level 
   security issues such as resource starvation and sharing of 
   resources between Streams. 

   The next issue is how an STag name is associated with a Data 
   Buffer. For the case of an Untagged Data Buffer, there is no wire 
   visible mapping between an STag and the Data Buffer. Note that 
   there may, in fact, be an STag which represents the buffer, if an 
   implementation chooses to internally represent Untagged Data  
   Buffer using STags. However, because the STag by definition is 
   not visible on the wire, this is a local host implementation 
   specific issue which should be analyzed in the context of a local 
   host implementation specific security analysis, and thus is 
   outside the scope of this document.  

   For a Tagged Data Buffer, either the Privileged ULP or the 
   Privileged Resource Manager acting on behalf of the Non-
   Privileged ULP may initialize a mapping from an STag to a Page 
   Translation Table, or may have the ability to simply 
   enable/disable an existing STag to Page Translation Table 
   mapping. There may also be multiple STag names which map to a 
   specific group of Page Translation Table entries (or sub-
   entries). Specific security issues with this level of flexibility 
   are examined in Section 6.2.3 Multiple STags to access the same 
   buffer. 

   There are a variety of implementation options for initialization 
   of Page Translation Table entries and mapping an STag to a group 
   of Page Translation Table entries which have security 
   repercussions. This includes support for separation of Mapping an 
   STag versus mapping a set of Page Translation Table entries, and 
   support for ULPs directly manipulating STag to Page Translation 
   Table entry mappings (versus requiring access through the 
   Privileged Resource Manager).

2.3.5  RNIC Data Transfer Interactions  

   RNIC Data Transfer operations can be subdivided into send 
   operations and receive operations.  

   For send operations, there is typically a queue that enables the 
   ULP to post multiple operation requests to send data (referred to 
   as the Send Queue). Depending upon the implementation, Data 
   Buffers used in the operations may or may not have Page 
   Translation Table entries associated with them, and may or may 
   not have STags associated with them. Because this is a local host 
   specific implementation issue rather than a protocol issue, the 
   security analysis of threats and mitigations is left to the host 
   implementation.  

   Receive operations are different for Tagged Data Buffers versus 
   Untagged Data Buffers (i.e. Tagged data transfer vs. Untagged 
   data transfer). For Untagged data transfer, if more than one 
   Untagged Data Buffer can be posted by the ULP, the DDP 
   specification requires that they be consumed in sequential order 
   (the RDMAP specification also requires this). Thus the most 
   general implementation is that there is a sequential queue of 
   receive Untagged Data Buffers (Receive Queue). Some 
   implementations may also support sharing of the sequential queue 
   between multiple Streams. In this case defining "sequential" 
   becomes non-trivial - in general the buffers for a single Stream 
   are consumed from the queue in the order that they were placed on 
   the queue, but there is no consumption order guarantee between 
   Streams.  

   For receive Tagged data transfer (i.e. Tagged Data Buffers, RDMA 
   Write Buffers, or RDMA Read Buffers), at some time prior to data 
   transfer, the mapping of the STag to specific Page Translation 
   Table entries (if present) and the mapping from the Page 
   Translation Table entries to the Data Buffer must have been 
   initialized (see section 2.3.4 for interaction details).

3  Trust and Resource Sharing 

   It is assumed that in general the Local and Remote Peer are 
   untrusted, and thus attacks by either should have mitigations in 
   place.  

   A separate, but related issue is resource sharing between 
   multiple Streams. If local resources are not shared, the 
   resources are dedicated on a per Stream basis. Resources are 
   defined in Section 2.2 Resources. The advantage of not sharing 
   resources between Streams is that it reduces the types of attacks 
   that are possible. The disadvantage of not sharing resources is 
   that ULPs might run out of resources. Thus there can be a strong 
   incentive for sharing resources, if the security issues 
   associated with the sharing of resources can be mitigated. 

   It is assumed in this document that the component that implements 
   the mechanism to control sharing of the RNIC Engine resources is 
   the Privileged Resource Manager. The RNIC Engine exposes its 
   resources through the RNIC Interface to the Privileged Resource 
   Manager. All Privileged and Non-Privileged ULPs request resources 
   from the Resource Manager (note that by definition both the Non-
   Privileged and the Privileged application might try to greedily 
   consume resources, thus creating a potential Denial of Service 
   (DOS) attack). The Resource Manager implements resource 
   management policies to ensure fair access to resources. The 
   Resource Manager should be designed to take into account security 
   attacks detailed in this document. Note that for some systems the 
   Privileged Resource Manager may be implemented within the 
   Privileged ULP.  

   All Non-Privileged ULP interactions with the RNIC Engine that 
   could affect other ULPs MUST be done using the Privileged 
   Resource Manager as a proxy. All ULP resource allocation requests 
   for scarce resources MUST also be done using a Privileged 
   Resource Manager.  

   The sharing of resources across Streams should be under the 
   control of the ULP, both in terms of the trust model the ULP 
   wishes to operate under, as well as the level of resource sharing 
   the ULP wishes to give local processes. For more discussion on 
   types of trust models which combine partial trust and sharing of 
   resources, see Appendix C: Partial Trust Taxonomy.  

   The Privileged Resource Manager MUST NOT assume different Streams 
   share Partial Mutual Trust unless there is a mechanism to ensure 
   that the Streams do indeed share Partial Mutual Trust. This can 
   be done in several ways, including explicit notification from the 
   ULP that owns the Streams.

4  Attacker Capabilities 

   An attacker's capabilities delimit the types of attacks that 
   attacker is able to launch. RDMAP and DDP require that the 
   initial LLP Stream (and connection) be set up prior to 
   transferring RDMAP/DDP Messages. This requires at least one 
   round-trip handshake to occur. 

   If the attacker is not the Remote Peer that created the initial 
   connection, then the attacker's capabilities can be segmented 
   into send only capabilities or send and receive capabilities. 
   Attacking with send only capabilities requires the attacker to 
   first guess the current LLP Stream parameters before they can 
   attack RNIC resources (e.g. TCP sequence number). If this class 
   of attacker also has receive capabilities and the ability to pose 
   as the receiver to the sender and the sender to the receiver, 
   they are typically referred to as a "man-in-the-middle" attacker 
   [RFC3552]. A man-in-the-middle attacker has a much wider ability 
   to attack RNIC resources. The breadth of attack is essentially 
   the same as that of an attacking Remote Peer (i.e. the Remote 
   Peer that setup the initial LLP Stream).

5  Attacks That Can be Mitigated With End-to-End Security 

   This section describes the RDMAP/DDP attacks where the only 
   solution is to implement some form of end-to-end security. The 
   analysis includes a detailed description of each attack, what is 
   being attacked, and a description of the countermeasures that can 
   be taken to thwart the attack. 

   Some forms of attack involve modifying the RDMAP or DDP payload 
   by a network based attacker or involve monitoring the traffic to 
   discover private information. An effective tool to ensure 
   confidentiality is to encrypt the data stream through mechanisms 
   such as IPsec encryption. An effective tool to ensure the remote 
   entity is who they claim to be as well as ensuring that the 
   payload is unmodified as it traverses the network is the use of 
   authentication protocols such as IPSec Authentication. 

   Note that connection setup and teardown is presumed to be done in 
   stream mode (i.e. no RDMA encapsulation of the payload), so there 
   are no new attacks related to connection setup/teardown beyond 
   what is already present in the LLP (e.g. TCP or SCTP). Note, 
   however, that RDMAP/DDP parameters may be exchanged in stream 
   mode, and if they are corrupted by an attacker unintended 
   consequences will result. Therefore, any existing mitigations for 
   LLP Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, 
   Denial of Service, or Elevation of Privilege continue to apply 
   (and are out of scope of this document). Thus the analysis in 
   this section focuses on attacks that are present regardless of 
   the LLP Stream type. 

   Tampering is any modification of the legitimate traffic (machine 
   internal or network). Spoofing attack is a special case of 
   tampering where the attacker falsifies an identity of the Remote 
   Peer (identity can be an IP address, machine name, ULP level 
   identity etc.).  

5.1  Spoofing  

   Spoofing attacks can be launched by the Remote Peer, or by a 
   network based attacker. A network based spoofing attack applies 
   to all Remote Peers. This section analyzes the various types of 
   spoofing attacks applicable to RDMAP & DDP. 

5.1.1  Impersonation 

   A network based attacker can impersonate a legal RDMAP/DDP Peer 
   (by spoofing a legal IP address). This can either be done as a 
   blind attack (see [RFC3552]) or by establishing an RDMAP/DDP 
   Stream with the victim. Because an RDMAP/DDP Stream requires an 
   LLP Stream to be fully initialized (e.g. for [TCP] it is in the 
   ESTABLISHED state), existing transport layer protection 
   mechanisms against blind attacks remain in place.  


   J. Pinkerton, et al.    Expires - September, 2006        [Page 19] 
   Internet-Draft             RDDP/RDMAP Security        March, 2006 

   For a blind attack to succeed, it requires the attacker to inject 
   a valid transport layer segment (e.g. for TCP it must match at 
   least the 4-tuple as well as guess a sequence number within the 
   window) while also guessing valid RDMAP or DDP parameters.  There 
   are many ways to attack the RDMAP/DDP protocol if the transport 
   protocol is assumed to be vulnerable. For example, for Tagged 
   Messages, this entails guessing the STag and TO values. If the 
   attacker wishes to simply terminate the connection, it can do so 
   by correctly guessing the transport & network layer values, and 
   providing an invalid STag. Per the DDP specification, if an 
   invalid STag is received, the Stream is torn down and the Remote 
   Peer is notified with an error. If an attacker wishes to 
   overwrite an Advertised Buffer, it must successfully guess the 
   correct STag and TO. Given that the TO often will start at zero, 
   this is straightforward. The value of the STag should be chosen 
   at random, as discussed in Section 6.1.1 Using an STag on a 
   Different Stream. For Untagged Messages, if the MSN is invalid 
   then the connection may be torn down. If it is valid, then the 
   receive buffers can be corrupted. 

   End-to-end authentication (e.g. IPsec or ULP authentication) 
   provides protection against either the blind attack or the 
   connected attack. 

5.1.2  Stream Hijacking 

   Stream hijacking happens when a network based attacker eavesdrops 
   the LLP connection through the Stream establishment phase, and 
   waits until the authentication phase (if such a phase exists) is 
   completed successfully. The attacker then spoofs the IP address 
   and re-directs the Stream from the victim to its own machine. For 
   example, an attacker can wait until an iSCSI authentication is 
   completed successfully, and then hijack the iSCSI Stream. 

   The best protection against this form of attack is end-to-end 
   integrity protection and authentication, such as IPsec, to 
   prevent spoofing. Another option is to provide a physically 
   segregated network for security. Discussion of physical security 
   is out of scope for this document. 

   Because the connection and/or Stream itself is established by the 
   LLP, some LLPs are more difficult to hijack than others. Please 
   see the relevant LLP documentation on security issues around 
   connection and/or Stream hijacking. 

5.1.3  Man-in-the-Middle Attack 

   If a network based attacker has the ability to delete or modify 
   packets which will still be accepted by the LLP (e.g., TCP 
   sequence number is correct) then the Stream can be exposed to a 
   man-in-the-middle attack. One style of attack is for the man-in-
   the-middle to send Tagged Messages (either RDMAP or DDP). If it 


   J. Pinkerton, et al.    Expires - September, 2006        [Page 20] 
   Internet-Draft             RDDP/RDMAP Security        March, 2006 

   can discover a buffer that has been exposed for STag enabled 
   access, then the man-in-the-middle can use an RDMA Read operation 
   to read the contents of the associated data buffer, perform an 
   RDMA Write Operation to modify the contents of the associated 
   data buffer, or invalidate the STag to disable further access to 
   the buffer.  

   The best protection against this form of attack is end-to-end 
   integrity protection and authentication, such as IPsec, to 
   prevent spoofing or tampering. If authentication and integrity 
   protections are not used, then physical protection must be 
   employed to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. 

   Because the connection/Stream itself is established by the LLP, 
   some LLPs are more exposed to man-in-the-middle attack than 
   others. Please see the relevant LLP documentation on security 
   issues around connection and/or Stream hijacking. 

   Another approach is to restrict access to only the local 
   subnet/link, and provide some mechanism to limit access, such as 
   physical security or 802.1.x. This model is an extremely limited 
   deployment scenario, and will not be further examined here. 

5.2  Tampering - Network based modification of buffer content 

   This is actually a man in the middle attack - but only on the 
   content of the buffer, as opposed to the man in the middle attack 
   presented above, where both the signaling and content can be 
   modified. See Section 5.1.3 Man-in-the-Middle Attack. 

5.3  Information Disclosure - Network Based Eavesdropping 

   An attacker that is able to eavesdrop on the network can read the 
   content of all read and write accesses to a Peer's buffers. To 
   prevent information disclosure, the read/written data must be 
   encrypted. See also Section 5.1.3 Man-in-the-Middle Attack. The 
   encryption can be done either by the ULP, or by a protocol that 
   can provide security services to RDMAP & DDP (e.g. IPsec). 

5.4  Specific Requirements for Security Services 

   Generally speaking, Stream confidentiality protects against 
   eavesdropping. Stream and/or session authentication and integrity 
   protection is a counter measurement against various spoofing and 
   tampering attacks. The effectiveness of authentication and 
   integrity against a specific attack depend on whether the 
   authentication is machine level authentication (such as IPsec), 
   or ULP authentication.

5.4.1  Introduction to Security Options 

   The following security services can be applied to an RDMAP/DDP 
   Stream: 

   1.  Session confidentiality - protects against eavesdropping 
       (section 5.3). 

   2.  Per-packet data source authentication - protects against the 
       following spoofing attacks: network based impersonation 
       (section 5.1.1), Stream hijacking (section 5.1.2), and man in 
       the middle (section 5.1.3). 

   3.  Per-packet integrity - protects against tampering done by 
       network based modification of buffer content (section 5.2) 

   4.  Packet sequencing - protects against replay attacks, which is 
       a special case of the above tampering attack. 

   If an RDMAP/DDP Stream may be subject to impersonation attacks, 
   or Stream hijacking attacks, it is recommended that the Stream be 
   authenticated, integrity protected, and protected from replay 
   attacks; it may use confidentiality protection to protect from 
   eavesdropping (in case the RDMAP/DDP Stream traverses a public 
   network). 

   IPsec is a protocol suite which is used to secure communication 
   at the network layer between two peers. The IPsec protocol suite 
   is specified within the IP Security Architecture [RFC2401], IKE 
   [RFC2409], IPsec Authentication Header (AH) [RFC2402] and IPsec 
   Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) [RFC2406] documents. IKE is 
   the key management protocol while AH and ESP are used to protect 
   IP traffic. Please see those RFCs for a complete description of 
   the respective protocols. 

   IPsec is capable of providing the above security services for IP 
   and TCP traffic respectively. ULP protocols are able to provide 
   only part of the above security services.  

5.4.2  TLS is Inappropriate for DDP/RDMAP Security 

   TLS [RFC 2246] provide Stream authentication, integrity and 
   confidentiality for TCP based ULPs. TLS supports one-way (server 
   only) or mutual certificates based authentication.  

   There are at least two limitations that make TLS underneath RDMAP 
   inappropriate for DDP/RDMA security: 

   1.  The maximum length supported by the TLS record layer protocol 
       is 2^14 bytes - longer packets must be fragmented (as a 
       comparison, the maximum length of an Untagged DDP Message is 
       roughly 2^32). 


   J. Pinkerton, et al.    Expires - September, 2006        [Page 22] 
   Internet-Draft             RDDP/RDMAP Security        March, 2006 

   2.  TLS is a connection oriented protocol. If a stream cipher or 
       block cipher in CBC mode is used for bulk encryption, then a 
       packet can be decrypted only after all the packets preceding 
       it have already arrived. If TLS is used to protect DDP/RDMAP 
       traffic, then TLS must gather all out-of-order packets before 
       RDMAP/DDP can place them into the ULP buffer. Thus one of the 
       primary features of DDP/RDMAP - enabling implementations to 
       have a flow-through architecture with little to no buffering, 
       can not be achieved if TLS is used to protect the data 
       stream. 

   If TLS is layered on top of RDMAP or DDP, TLS does not protect 
   the RDMAP and/or DDP headers. Thus a man-in-the-middle attack can 
   still occur by modifying the RDMAP/DDP header to incorrectly 
   place the data into the wrong buffer, thus effectively corrupting 
   the data stream.  

   For these reasons, it is NOT RECOMMENDED that TLS be layered on 
   top of RDMAP or DDP. 

5.4.3  ULPs Which Provide Security 

   ULPs which provide integrated security but wish to leverage 
   lower-layer protocol security should be aware of security 
   concerns around correlating a specific channel's security 
   mechanisms to the authentication performed by the ULP. See 
   [NFSv4CHANNEL] for additional information on a promising approach 
   called "channel binding". From [NFSv4CHANNEL]: 

        "The concept of channel bindings allows applications to 
        prove that the end-points of two secure channels at 
        different network layers are the same by binding 
        authentication at one channel to the session protection at 
        the other channel.  The use of channel bindings allows 
        applications to delegate session protection to lower layers, 
        which may significantly improve performance for some 
        applications." 

5.4.4  Requirements for IPsec Encapsulation of DDP 

   The IP Storage working group has spent significant time and 
   effort to define the normative IPsec requirements for IP Storage 
   [RFC3723]. Portions of that specification are applicable to a 
   wide variety of protocols, including the RDDP protocol suite. In 
   order to not replicate this effort, an RNIC implementation MUST 
   follow the requirements defined in RFC3723 Section 2.3 and 
   Section 5, including the associated normative references for 
   those sections. Note that this means that support for IPSEC ESP 
   mode is normative. 

   Additionally, since IPsec acceleration hardware may only be able 
   to handle a limited number of active IKE Phase 2 SAs, Phase 2 


   J. Pinkerton, et al.    Expires - September, 2006        [Page 23] 
   Internet-Draft             RDDP/RDMAP Security        March, 2006 

   delete messages may be sent for idle SAs, as a means of keeping 
   the number of active Phase 2 SAs to a minimum. The receipt of an 
   IKE Phase 2 delete message MUST NOT be interpreted as a reason 
   for tearing down an DDP/RDMA Stream. Rather, it is preferable to 
   leave the Stream up, and if additional traffic is sent on it, to 
   bring up another IKE Phase 2 SA to protect it. This avoids the 
   potential for continually bringing Streams up and down. 

   Note that there are serious security issues if IPsec is not 
   implemented end-to-end. For example, if IPsec is implemented as a 
   tunnel in the middle of the network, any hosts between the Peer 
   and the IPsec tunneling device can freely attack the unprotected 
   Stream.

6  Attacks from Remote Peers 

   This section describes remote attacks that are possible against 
   the RDMA system defined in Figure 1 - RDMA Security Model and the 
   RNIC Engine resources defined in Section 2.2. The analysis 
   includes a detailed description of each attack, what is being 
   attacked, and a description of the countermeasures that can be 
   taken to thwart the attack. 

   The attacks are classified into five categories: Spoofing, 
   Tampering, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service (DoS) 
   attacks, and Elevation of Privileges. As mentioned previously, 
   tampering is any modification of the legitimate traffic (machine 
   internal or network). A spoofing attack is a special case of 
   tampering where the attacker falsifies an identity of the Remote 
   Peer (identity can be an IP address, machine name, ULP level 
   identity etc.).  

6.1  Spoofing  

   This section analyzes the various types of spoofing attacks 
   applicable to RDMAP & DDP. Spoofing attacks can be launched by 
   the Remote Peer, or by a network based attacker. For 
   countermeasures against a network based attacker, see Section 5 
   Attacks That Can be Mitigated With End-to-End Security.  

6.1.1  Using an STag on a Different Stream 

   One style of attack from the Remote Peer is for it to attempt to 
   use STag values that it is not authorized to use. Note that if 
   the Remote Peer sends an invalid STag to the Local Peer, per the 
   DDP and RDMAP specifications, the Stream must be torn down. Thus 
   the threat exists if an STag has been enabled for Remote Access 
   on one Stream and a Remote Peer is able to use it on an unrelated 
   Stream. If the attack is successful, the attacker could 
   potentially be able to perform either RDMA Read Operations to 
   read the contents of the associated data buffer, perform RDMA 
   Write Operations to modify the contents of the associated data 
   buffer, or to invalidate the STag to disable further access to 
   the buffer.  

   An attempt by a Remote Peer to access a buffer with an STag on a 
   different Stream in the same Protection Domain may or may not be 
   an attack depending on whether resource sharing is intended (i.e. 
   whether the Streams shared Partial Mutual Trust or not). For some 
   ULPs using an STag on multiple Streams within the same Protection 
   Domain could be desired behavior. For other ULPs attempting to 
   use an STag on a different Stream could be considered to be an 
   attack. Since this varies by ULP, a ULP typically would need to 
   be able to control the scope of the STag. 




   J. Pinkerton, et al.    Expires - September, 2006        [Page 25] 
   Internet-Draft             RDDP/RDMAP Security        March, 2006 

   In the case where an implementation does not share resources 
   between Streams (including STags), this attack can be defeated by 
   assigning each Stream to a different Protection Domain. Before 
   allowing remote access to the buffer, the Protection Domain of 
   the Stream where the access attempt was made is matched against 
   the Protection Domain of the STag. If the Protection Domains do 
   not match, access to the buffer is denied, an error is generated, 
   and the RDMAP Stream associated with the attacking Stream is 
   terminated.  

   For implementations that share resources between multiple 
   Streams, it may not be practical to separate each Stream into its 
   own Protection Domain. In this case, the ULP can still limit the 
   scope of any of the STags to a single Stream (if it is enabling 
   it for remote access). If the STag scope has been limited to a 
   single Stream, any attempt to use that STag on a different Stream 
   will result in an error, and the RDMAP Stream is terminated.  

   Thus for implementations that do not share STags between Streams, 
   each Stream MUST either be in a separate Protection Domain or the 
   scope of an STag MUST be limited to a single Stream. 

   An RNIC MUST ensure that a specific Stream in a specific 
   Protection Domain can not access an STag in a different 
   Protection Domain. 

   An RNIC MUST ensure that if an STag is limited in scope to a 
   single Stream, no other Stream can use the STag.   

   An additional issue may be unintended sharing of STags (i.e. a 
   bug in the ULP) or a bug in the Remote Peer which causes an off-
   by-one STag to be used. For additional protection, an 
   implementation should allocate STags in such a fashion that it is 
   difficult to predict the next allocated STag number, and also 
   ensure that STags are reused at as slow a rate as possible. Any 
   allocation method which would lead to intentional or 
   unintentional reuse of an STag by the peer should be avoided 
   (e.g. a method which always starts with a given STag and 
   monotonically increases it for each new allocation, or a method 
   which always uses the same STag for each operation). 

6.2  Tampering 

   A Remote Peer or a network based attacker can attempt to tamper 
   with the contents of data buffers on a Local Peer that have been 
   enabled for remote write access. The types of tampering attacks 
   from a Remote Peer are outlined in the sections that follow. For 
   countermeasures against a network based attacker, see Section 5 
   Attacks That Can be Mitigated With End-to-End Security. 





   J. Pinkerton, et al.    Expires - September, 2006        [Page 26] 
   Internet-Draft             RDDP/RDMAP Security        March, 2006 

6.2.1  Buffer Overrun - RDMA Write or Read Response 

   This attack is an attempt by the Remote Peer to perform an RDMA 
   Write or RDMA Read Response to memory outside of the valid length 
   range of the data buffer enabled for remote write access. This 
   attack can occur even when no resources are shared across 
   Streams. This issue can also arise if the ULP has a bug. 

   The countermeasure for this type of attack must be in the RNIC 
   implementation, leveraging the STag. When the local ULP specifies 
   to the RNIC the base address and the number of bytes in the 
   buffer that it wishes to make accessible, the RNIC must ensure 
   that the base and bounds check are applied to any access to the 
   buffer referenced by the STag before the STag is enabled for 
   access. When an RDMA data transfer operation (which includes an 
   STag) arrives on a Stream, a base and bounds byte granularity 
   access check must be performed to ensure the operation accesses 
   only memory locations within the buffer described by that STag.  

   Thus an RNIC implementation MUST ensure that a Remote Peer is not 
   able to access memory outside of the buffer specified when the 
   STag was enabled for remote access. 

6.2.2  Modifying a Buffer After Indication 

   This attack can occur if a Remote Peer attempts to modify the 
   contents of an STag referenced buffer by performing an RDMA Write 
   or an RDMA Read Response after the Remote Peer has indicated to 
   the Local Peer or local ULP (by a variety of means) that the STag 
   data buffer contents are ready for use. This attack can occur 
   even when no resources are shared across Streams. Note that a bug 
   in a Remote Peer, or network based tampering, could also result 
   in this problem. 

   For example, assume the STag referenced buffer contains ULP 
   control information as well as ULP payload, and the ULP sequence 
   of operation is to first validate the control information and 
   then perform operations on the control information. If the Remote 
   Peer can perform an additional RDMA Write or RDMA Read Response 
   (thus changing the buffer) after the validity checks have been 
   completed but before the control data is operated on, the Remote 
   Peer could force the ULP down operational paths that were never 
   intended.  

   The local ULP can protect itself from this type of attack by 
   revoking remote access when the original data transfer has 
   completed and before it validates the contents of the buffer. The 
   local ULP can either do this by explicitly revoking remote access 
   rights for the STag when the Remote Peer indicates the operation 
   has completed, or by checking to make sure the Remote Peer 
   invalidated the STag through the RDMAP Remote Invalidate 
   capability (see section 6.4.5 Remote Invalidate an STag Shared on 


   J. Pinkerton, et al.    Expires - September, 2006        [Page 27] 
   Internet-Draft             RDDP/RDMAP Security        March, 2006 

   Multiple Streams for a definition of Remote Invalidate), and if 
   it did not, the local ULP then explicitly revokes the STag remote 
   access rights.  

   The local ULP SHOULD follow the above procedure to protect the 
   buffer before it validates the contents of the buffer (or uses 
   the buffer in any way). 

   An RNIC MUST ensure that network packets using the STag for a 
   previously advertised buffer can no longer modify the buffer 
   after the ULP revokes remote access rights for the specific STag.  

6.2.3  Multiple STags to access the same buffer 

   See section 6.3.6 Using Multiple STags Which Alias to the Same 
   Buffer for this analysis. 

6.3  Information Disclosure 

   The main potential source for information disclosure is through a 
   local buffer that has been enabled for remote access. If the 
   buffer can be probed by a Remote Peer on another Stream, then 
   there is potential for information disclosure.  

   The potential attacks that could result in unintended information 
   disclosure and countermeasures are detailed in the following 
   sections. 

6.3.1  Probing memory outside of the buffer bounds 

   This is essentially the same attack as described in Section 
   6.2.1, except an RDMA Read Request is used to mount the attack. 
   The same countermeasure applies. 

6.3.2  Using RDMA Read to Access Stale Data 

   If a buffer is being used for a combination of reads and writes 
   (either remote or local), and is exposed to the Remote Peer with 
   at least remote read access rights, the Remote Peer may be able 
   to examine the contents of the buffer before they are initialized 
   with the correct data. In this situation, whatever contents were 
   present in the buffer before the buffer is initialized can be 
   viewed by the Remote Peer, if the Remote Peer performs an RDMA 
   Read.  

   Because of this, the local ULP SHOULD ensure that no stale data 
   is contained in the buffer before remote read access rights are 
   granted (this can be done by zeroing the contents of the memory, 
   for example).

   Internet-Draft             RDDP/RDMAP Security        March, 2006 

6.3.3  Accessing a Buffer After the Transfer 

   If the Remote Peer has remote read access to a buffer, and by 
   some mechanism tells the local ULP that the transfer has been 
   completed, but the local ULP does not disable remote access to 
   the buffer before modifying the data, it is possible for the 
   Remote Peer to retrieve the new data. 

   This is similar to the attack defined in Section 6.2.2 Modifying 
   a Buffer After Indication. The same countermeasures apply. In 
   addition, the local ULP SHOULD grant remote read access rights 
   only for the amount of time needed to retrieve the data. 

6.3.4  Accessing Unintended Data With a Valid STag 

   If the ULP enables remote access to a buffer using an STag that 
   references the entire buffer, but intends only a portion of the 
   buffer to be accessed, it is possible for the Remote Peer to 
   access the other parts of the buffer anyway. 

   To prevent this attack, the ULP SHOULD set the base and bounds of 
   the buffer when the STag is initialized to expose only the data 
   to be retrieved. 

6.3.5  RDMA Read into an RDMA Write Buffer 

   One form of disclosure can occur if the access rights on the 
   buffer enabled remote read, when only remote write access was 
   intended. If the buffer contained ULP data, or data from a 
   transfer on an unrelated Stream, the Remote Peer could retrieve 
   the data through an RDMA Read operation. Note that an RNIC 
   implementation is not required to support STags that have both 
   read and write access. 

   The most obvious countermeasure for this attack is to not grant 
   remote read access if the buffer is intended to be write-only. 
   Then the Remote Peer would not be able to retrieve data 
   associated with the buffer. An attempt to do so would result in 
   an error and the RDMAP Stream associated with the Stream would be 
   terminated.  

   Thus if a ULP only intends a buffer to be exposed for remote 
   write access, it MUST set the access rights to the buffer to only 
   enable remote write access.  Note that this requirement is not 
   meant to restrict the use of zero-length RDMA Reads. Zero-length 
   RDMA Reads do not expose ULP data. Because they are intended to 
   be used as a mechanism to ensure that all RDMA Writes have been 
   received, and do not even require a valid STag, their use is 
   permitted even if a buffer has only been enabled for write 
   access.

6.3.6  Using Multiple STags Which Alias to the Same Buffer  

   Multiple STags which alias to the same buffer at the same time 
   can result in unintentional information disclosure if the STags 
   are used by different, mutually untrusted, Remote Peers. This 
   model applies specifically to client/server communication, where 
   the server is communicating with multiple clients, each of which 
   do not mutually trust each other.  

   If only read access is enabled, then the local ULP has complete 
   control over information disclosure. Thus a server which intended 
   to expose the same data (i.e. buffer) to multiple clients by 
   using multiple STags to the same buffer creates no new security 
   issues beyond what has already been described in this document. 
   Note that if the server did not intend to expose the same data to 
   the clients, it should use separate buffers for each client (and 
   separate STags). 

   When one STag has remote read access enabled and a different STag 
   has remote write access enabled to the same buffer, it is 
   possible for one Remote Peer to view the contents that have been 
   written by another Remote Peer. 

   If both STags have remote write access enabled and the two Remote 
   Peers do not mutually trust each other, it is possible for one 
   Remote Peer to overwrite the contents that have been written by 
   the other Remote Peer.  

   Thus a ULP with multiple Remote Peers which do not share Partial 
   Mutual Trust MUST NOT grant write access to the same buffer 
   through different STags. A buffer should be exposed to only one 
   untrusted Remote Peer at a time to ensure that no information 
   disclosure or information tampering occurs between peers.  

6.3.7  Controlling Access to PTT & STag Mapping 

   If a Non-Privileged ULP is able to directly manipulate the RNIC 
   Page Translation Tables (which translate from an STag to a host 
   address), it is possible that the Non-Privileged ULP could point 
   the Page Translation Table at an unrelated Stream's or ULP's 
   buffers and thereby be able to gain access to information of the 
   unrelated Stream/ULP.  

   As discussed in Section 2 Architectural Model, introduction of a 
   Privileged Resource Manager to arbitrate the mapping requests is 
   an effective countermeasure. This enables the Privileged Resource 
   Manager to ensure a local ULP can only initialize the Page 
   Translation Table (PTT)to point to its own buffers. 

   Thus if Non-Privileged ULPs are supported, the Privileged 
   Resource Manager MUST verify that the Non-Privileged ULP has the 
   right to access a specific Data Buffer before allowing an STag 


   J. Pinkerton, et al.    Expires - September, 2006        [Page 30] 
   Internet-Draft             RDDP/RDMAP Security        March, 2006 

   for which the ULP has access rights to be associated with a 
   specific Data Buffer. This can be done when the Page Translation 
   Table is initialized to access the Data Buffer or when the STag 
   is initialized to point to a group of Page Translation Table 
   entries, or both. 

6.4  Denial of Service (DOS) 

   A DOS attack is one of the primary security risks of RDMAP. This 
   is because RNIC resources are valuable and scarce, and many ULP 
   environments require communication with untrusted Remote Peers. 
   If the Remote Peer can be authenticated or the ULP payload 
   encrypted, clearly, the DOS profile can be reduced. For the 
   purposes of this analysis, it is assumed that the RNIC must be 
   able to operate in untrusted environments, which are open to DOS 
   style attacks. 

   Denial of service attacks against RNIC resources are not the 
   typical unknown party spraying packets at a random host (such as 
   a TCP SYN attack). Because the connection/Stream must be fully 
   established (e.g. a 3 message transport layer handshake has 
   occurred), the attacker must be able to both send and receive 
   messages over that connection/Stream, or be able to guess a valid 
   packet on an existing RDMAP Stream. 

   This section outlines the potential attacks and the 
   countermeasures available for dealing with each attack.  

6.4.1  RNIC Resource Consumption  

   This section covers attacks that fall into the general category 
   of a local ULP attempting to unfairly allocate scarce (i.e. 
   bounded) RNIC resources. The local ULP may be attempting to 
   allocate resources on its own behalf, or on behalf of a Remote 
   Peer. Resources that fall into this category include: Protection 
   Domains, Stream Context Memory, Translation and Protection 
   Tables, and STag namespace. These can be due to attacks by 
   currently active local ULPs or ones that allocated resources 
   earlier, but are now idle. 

   This type of attack can occur regardless of whether or not 
   resources are shared across Streams. 

   The allocation of all scarce resources MUST be placed under the 
   control of a Privileged Resource Manager. This allows the 
   Privileged Resource Manager to: 

       *   prevent a local ULP from allocating more than its fair 
           share of resources.  

       *   detect if a Remote Peer is attempting to launch a DOS 
           attack by attempting to create an excessive number of

           Streams (with associated resources) and take corrective 
           action (such as refusing the request or applying network 
           layer filters against the Remote Peer). 

   This analysis assumes that the Resource Manager is responsible 
   for handing out Protection Domains, and RNIC implementations will 
   provide enough Protection Domains to allow the Resource Manager 
   to be able to assign a unique Protection Domain for each 
   unrelated, untrusted local ULP (for a bounded, reasonable number 
   of local ULPs). This analysis further assumes that the Resource 
   Manager implements policies to ensure that untrusted local ULPs 
   are not able to consume all of the Protection Domains through a 
   DOS attack. Note that Protection Domain consumption cannot result 
   from a DOS attack launched by a Remote Peer, unless a local ULP 
   is acting on the Remote Peer's behalf. 

6.4.2  Resource Consumption by Idle ULPs 

   The simplest form of a DOS attack given a fixed amount of 
   resources is for the Remote Peer to create a RDMAP Stream to a 
   Local Peer, and request dedicated resources then do no actual 
   work. This allows the Remote Peer to be very light weight (i.e. 
   only negotiate resources, but do no data transfer) and consumes a 
   disproportionate amount of resources at the Local Peer. 

   A general countermeasure for this style of attack is to monitor 
   active RDMAP Streams and if resources are getting low, reap the 
   resources from RDMAP Streams that are not transferring data and 
   possibly terminate the Stream. This would presumably be under 
   administrative control. 

   Refer to Section 6.4.1 for the analysis and countermeasures for 
   this style of attack on the following RNIC resources: Stream 
   Context Memory, Page Translation Tables and STag namespace. 

   Note that some RNIC resources are not at risk of this type of 
   attack from a Remote Peer because an attack requires the Remote 
   Peer to send messages in order to consume the resource. Receive 
   Data Buffers, Completion Queue, and RDMA Read Request Queue 
   resources are examples. These resources are, however, at risk 
   from a local ULP that attempts to allocate resources, then goes 
   idle. This could also be created if the ULP negotiates the 
   resource levels with the Remote Peer, which causes the Local Peer 
   to consume resources, however the Remote Peer never sends data to 
   consume them. The general countermeasure described in this 
   section can be used to free resources allocated by an idle Local 
   Peer.  

6.4.3  Resource Consumption By Active ULPs 

   This section describes DOS attacks from Local and Remote Peers 
   that are actively exchanging messages. Attacks on each RDMA NIC

   resource are examined and specific countermeasures are 
   identified. Note that attacks on Stream Context Memory, Page 
   Translation Tables, and STag namespace are covered in Section 
   6.4.1 RNIC Resource Consumption, so are not included here. 

6.4.3.1  Multiple Streams Sharing Receive Buffers 

   The Remote Peer can attempt to consume more than its fair share 
   of receive data buffers (i.e. Untagged buffers for DDP are or 
   Send Type Messages for RDMAP) if receive buffers are shared 
   across multiple Streams.  

   If resources are not shared across multiple Streams, then this 
   attack is not possible because the Remote Peer will not be able 
   to consume more buffers than were allocated to the Stream. The 
   worst case scenario is that the Remote Peer can consume more 
   receive buffers than the local ULP allowed, resulting in no 
   buffers being available, which could cause the Remote Peer's 
   Stream to the Local Peer to be torn down, and all allocated 
   resources to be released.  

   If local receive data buffers are shared among multiple Streams, 
   then the Remote Peer can attempt to consume more than its fair 
   share of the receive buffers, causing a different Stream to be 
   short of receive buffers, thus possibly causing the other Stream 
   to be torn down. For example, if the Remote Peer sent enough one 
   byte Untagged Messages, they might be able to consume all local 
   shared receive queue resources with little effort on their part. 

   One method the Local Peer could use is to recognize that a Remote 
   Peer is attempting to use more than its fair share of resources 
   and terminate the Stream (causing the allocated resources to be 
   released). However, if the Local Peer is sufficiently slow, it 
   may be possible for the Remote Peer to still mount a denial of 
   service attack. One countermeasure that can protect against this 
   attack is implementing a low-water notification. The low-water 
   notification alerts the ULP if the number of buffers in the 
   receive queue is less than a threshold. 

   If all of the following conditions are true, then the Local Peer 
   or local ULP can size the amount of local receive buffers posted 
   on the receive queue to ensure a DOS attack can be stopped. 

       *   a low-water notification is enabled, and  

       *   the Local Peer is able to bound the amount of time that 
           it takes to replenish receive buffers, and  

       *   the Local Peer maintains statistics to determine which 
           Remote Peer is consuming buffers.  




   J. Pinkerton, et al.    Expires - September, 2006        [Page 33] 
   Internet-Draft             RDDP/RDMAP Security        March, 2006 

   The above conditions enable the low-water notification to arrive 
   before resources are depleted and thus the Local Peer or local 
   ULP can take corrective action (e.g., terminate the Stream of the 
   attacking Remote Peer). 

   A different, but similar attack is if the Remote Peer sends a 
   significant number of out-of-order packets and the RNIC has the 
   ability to use the ULP buffer (i.e. the Untagged Buffer for DDP 
   or the buffer consumed by a Send Type Message for RDMAP) as a 
   reassembly buffer. In this case the Remote Peer can consume a 
   significant number of ULP buffers, but never send enough data to 
   enable the ULP buffer to be completed to the ULP. 

   An effective countermeasure is to create a high-water 
   notification which alerts the ULP if there is more than a 
   specified number of receive buffers "in process" (partially 
   consumed, but not completed). The notification is generated when 
   more than the specified number of buffers are in process 
   simultaneously on a specific Stream (i.e., packets have started 
   to arrive for the buffer, but the buffer has not yet been 
   delivered to the ULP). 

   A different countermeasure is for the RNIC Engine to provide the 
   capability to limit the Remote Peer's ability to consume receive 
   buffers on a per Stream basis. Unfortunately this requires a 
   large amount of state to be tracked in each RNIC on a per Stream 
   basis. 

   Thus, if an RNIC Engine provides the ability to share receive 
   buffers across multiple Streams, the combination of the RNIC 
   Engine and the Privileged Resource Manager MUST be able to detect 
   if the Remote Peer is attempting to consume more than its fair 
   share of resources so that the Local Peer or local ULP can apply 
   countermeasures to detect and prevent the attack. 

6.4.3.2  Remote or Local Peer Attacking a Shared CQ 

   For an overview of the shared CQ attack model, see Section 7.1.  

   The Remote Peer can attack a shared CQ by consuming more than its 
   fair share of CQ entries by using one of the following methods:  

       *   The ULP protocol allows the Remote Peer to cause the 
           local ULP to reserve a specified number of CQ entries, 
           possibly leaving insufficient entries for other Streams 
           that are sharing the CQ.  

       *   If the Remote Peer, Local Peer, or local ULP (or any 
           combination) can attack the CQ by overwhelming the CQ 
           with completions, then completion processing on other 
           Streams sharing that Completion Queue can be affected 



   J. Pinkerton, et al.    Expires - September, 2006        [Page 34] 
   Internet-Draft             RDDP/RDMAP Security        March, 2006 

           (e.g. the Completion Queue overflows and stops 
           functioning). 

   The first method of attack can be avoided if the ULP does not 
   allow a Remote Peer to reserve CQ entries or there is a trusted 
   intermediary such as a Privileged Resource Manager. Unfortunately 
   it is often unrealistic to not allow a Remote Peer to reserve CQ 
   entries - particularly if the number of completion entries is 
   dependent on other ULP negotiated parameters, such as the amount 
   of buffering required by the ULP. Thus an implementation MUST 
   implement a Privileged Resource Manager to control the allocation 
   of CQ entries. See Section 2.1 Components for a definition of 
   Privileged Resource Manager. 

   One way that a Local or Remote Peer can attempt to overwhelm a CQ 
   with completions is by sending minimum length RDMAP/DDP Messages 
   to cause as many completions (receive completions for the Remote 
   Peer, send completions for the Local Peer) per second as 
   possible. If it is the Remote Peer attacking, and we assume that 
   the Local Peer's receive queue(s) do not run out of receive 
   buffers (if they do, then this is a different attack, documented 
   in Section 6.4.3.1 Multiple Streams Sharing Receive Buffers), 
   then it might be possible for the Remote Peer to consume more 
   than its fair share of Completion Queue entries. Depending upon 
   the CQ implementation, this could either cause the CQ to overflow 
   (if it is not large enough to handle all of the completions 
   generated) or for another Stream to not be able to generate CQ 
   entries (if the RNIC had flow control on generation of CQ entries 
   into the CQ). In either case, the CQ will stop functioning 
   correctly and any Streams expecting completions on the CQ will 
   stop functioning.  

   This attack can occur regardless of whether all of the Streams 
   associated with the CQ are in the same Protection Domain or are 
   in different Protection Domains - the key issue is that the 
   number of Completion Queue entries is less than the number of all 
   outstanding operations that can cause a completion. 

   The Local Peer can protect itself from this type of attack using 
   either of the following methods: 

       *   Size the CQ to the appropriate level, as specified below 
           (note that if the CQ currently exists, and it needs to be 
           resized, resizing the CQ is not required to succeed in 
           all cases, so the CQ resize should be done before sizing 
           the Send Queue and Receive Queue on the Stream), OR 

       *   Grant fewer resources than the Remote Peer requested (not 
           supplying the number of Receive Data Buffers requested). 

   The proper sizing of the CQ is dependent on whether the local 
   ULP(s) will post as many resources to the various queues as the 


   J. Pinkerton, et al.    Expires - September, 2006        [Page 35] 
   Internet-Draft             RDDP/RDMAP Security        March, 2006 

   size of the queue enables or not. If the local ULP(s) can be 
   trusted to post a number of resources that is smaller than the 
   size of the specific resource's queue, then a correctly sized CQ 
   means that the CQ is large enough to hold completion status for 
   all of the outstanding Data Buffers (both send and receive 
   buffers), or: 

            CQ_MIN_SIZE = SUM(MaxPostedOnEachRQ)  
                          + SUM(MaxPostedOnEachSRQ) 
                          + SUM(MaxPostedOnEachSQ) 

   Where: 

           MaxPostedOnEachRQ = the maximum number of requests which 
                  can cause a completion that will be posted on a 
                  specific Receive Queue. 

           MaxPostedOnEachSRQ = the maximum number of requests which 
                  can cause a completion that will be posted on a 
                  specific Shared Receive Queue. 

           MaxPostedOnEachSQ = the maximum number of requests which 
                  can cause a completion that will be posted on a 
                  specific Send Queue. 

   If the local ULP must be able to completely fill the queues, or 
   can not be trusted to observe a limit smaller than the queues, 
   then the CQ must be sized to accommodate the maximum number of 
   operations that it is possible to post at any one time. Thus the 
   equation becomes: 

            CQ_MIN_SIZE = SUM(SizeOfEachRQ)  
                          + SUM(SizeOfEachSRQ) 
                          + SUM(SizeOfEachSQ)  

   Where: 

          SizeOfEachRQ = the maximum number of requests which 
                  can cause a completion that can ever be posted  
                  on a specific Receive Queue. 

          SizeOfEachSRQ = the maximum number of requests which 
                  can cause a completion that can ever be posted  
                  on a specific Shared Receive Queue.  

          SizeOfEachSQ = the maximum number of requests which 
                  can cause a completion that can ever be posted  
                  on a specific Send Queue.  

   Where MaxPosted*OnEach*Q and SizeOfEach*Q varies on a per Stream 
   or per Shared Receive Queue basis.

   If the ULP is sharing a CQ across multiple Streams which do not 
   share Partial Mutual Trust, then the ULP MUST implement a 
   mechanism to ensure that the Completion Queue can not overflow. 
   Note that it is possible to share CQs even if the Remote Peers 
   accessing the CQs are untrusted if either of the above two 
   formulas are implemented. If the ULP can be trusted to not post 
   more than MaxPostedOnEachRQ, MaxPostedOnEachSRQ, and 
   MaxPostedOnEachSQ, then the first formula applies. If the ULP can 
   not be trusted to obey the limit, then the second formula 
   applies. 

6.4.3.3  Attacking the RDMA Read Request Queue 

   The RDMA Read Request Queue can be attacked if the Remote Peer 
   sends more RDMA Read Requests than the depth of the RDMA Read 
   Request Queue at the Local Peer. If the RDMA Read Request Queue 
   is a shared resource, this could corrupt the queue. If the queue 
   is not shared, then the worst case is that the current Stream is 
   no longer functional (e.g. torn down). One approach to solving 
   the shared RDMA Read Request Queue would be to create thresholds, 
   similar to those described in Section 6.4.3.1 Multiple Streams 
   Sharing Receive Buffers. A simpler approach is to not share RDMA 
   Read Request Queue resources among Streams or enforce hard limits 
   of consumption per Stream. Thus RDMA Read Request Queue resource 
   consumption MUST be controlled by the Privileged Resource Manager 
   such that RDMAP/DDP Streams which do not share Partial Mutual 
   Trust do not share RDMA Read Request Queue resources.  

   If the issue is a bug in the Remote Peer's implementation, but 
   not a malicious attack, the issue can be solved by requiring the 
   Remote Peer's RNIC to throttle RDMA Read Requests. By properly 
   configuring the Stream at the Remote Peer through a trusted 
   agent, the RNIC can be made to not transmit RDMA Read Requests 
   that exceed the depth of the RDMA Read Request Queue at the Local 
   Peer. If the Stream is correctly configured, and if the Remote 
   Peer submits more requests than the Local Peer's RDMA Read 
   Request Queue can handle, the requests would be queued at the 
   Remote Peer's RNIC until previous requests complete. If the 
   Remote Peer's Stream is not configured correctly, the RDMAP 
   Stream is terminated when more RDMA Read Requests arrive at the 
   Local Peer than the Local Peer can handle (assuming the prior 
   paragraph's recommendation is implemented). Thus an RNIC 
   implementation SHOULD provide a mechanism to cap the number of 
   outstanding RDMA Read Requests. The configuration of this limit 
   is outside the scope of this document. 

6.4.4  Exercise of non-optimal code paths 

   Another form of DOS attack is to attempt to exercise data paths 
   that can consume a disproportionate amount of resources. An 
   example might be if error cases are handled on a "slow path" 
   (consuming either host or RNIC computational resources), and an 


   J. Pinkerton, et al.    Expires - September, 2006        [Page 37] 
   Internet-Draft             RDDP/RDMAP Security        March, 2006 

   attacker generates excessive numbers of errors in an attempt to 
   consume these resources. Note that for most RDMAP or DDP errors, 
   the attacking Stream will simply be torn down. Thus for this form 
   of attack to be effective, the Remote Peer needs to exercise data 
   paths which do not cause the Stream to be torn down. 

   If an RNIC implementation contains "slow paths" which do not 
   result in the tear down of the Stream, it is recommended that an 
   implementation provide the ability to detect the above condition 
   and allow an administrator to act, including potentially 
   administratively tearing down the RDMAP Stream associated with 
   the Stream exercising data paths consuming a disproportionate 
   amount of resources. 

6.4.5  Remote Invalidate an STag Shared on Multiple Streams 

   If a Local Peer has enabled an STag for remote access, the Remote 
   Peer could attempt to remote invalidate the STag by using the 
   RDMAP Send with Invalidate or Send with SE and Invalidate 
   Message. If the STag is only valid on the current Stream, then 
   the only side effect is that the Remote Peer can no longer use 
   the STag; thus there are no security issues. 

   If the STag is valid across multiple Streams, then the Remote 
   Peer can prevent other Streams from using that STag by using the 
   remote invalidate functionality.  

   Thus if RDDP Streams do not share Partial Mutual Trust (i.e. the 
   Remote Peer may attempt to remote invalidate the STag 
   prematurely), the ULP MUST NOT enable an STag which would be 
   valid across multiple Streams. 

6.4.6  Remote Peer attacking an Unshared CQ 

   The Remote Peer can attack an unshared CQ if the Local Peer does 
   not size the CQ correctly. For example, if the Local Peer enables 
   the CQ to handle completions of received buffers, and the receive 
   buffer queue is longer than the Completion Queue, then an 
   overflow can potentially occur. The effect on the attacker's 
   Stream is catastrophic. However if an RNIC does not have the 
   proper protections in place, then an attack to overflow the CQ 
   can also cause corruption and/or termination of an unrelated 
   Stream. Thus an RNIC MUST ensure that if a CQ overflows, any 
   Streams which do not use the CQ MUST remain unaffected. 

6.5  Elevation of Privilege 

   The RDMAP/DDP Security Architecture explicitly differentiates 
   between three levels of privilege - Non-Privileged, Privileged, 
   and the Privileged Resource Manager. If a Non-Privileged ULP is 
   able to elevate its privilege level to a Privileged ULP, then 
   mapping a physical address list to an STag can provide local and 


   J. Pinkerton, et al.    Expires - September, 2006        [Page 38] 
   Internet-Draft             RDDP/RDMAP Security        March, 2006 

   remote access to any physical address location on the node. If a 
   Privileged Mode ULP is able to promote itself to be a Resource 
   Manager, then it is possible for it to perform denial of service 
   type attacks where substantial amounts of local resources could 
   be consumed. 

   In general, elevation of privilege is a local implementation 
   specific issue and thus outside the scope of this document.

7  Attacks from Local Peers 

   This section describes local attacks that are possible against 
   the RDMA system defined in Figure 1 - RDMA Security Model and the 
   RNIC Engine resources defined in Section 2.2.  

7.1  Local ULP Attacking a Shared CQ 

   DOS attacks against a Shared Completion Queue (CQ - see Section 
   2.2.6 Completion Queues) can be caused by either the local ULP or 
   the Remote Peer if either attempts to cause more completions than 
   its fair share of the number of entries, thus potentially 
   starving another unrelated ULP such that no Completion Queue 
   entries are available. 

   A Completion Queue entry can potentially be maliciously consumed 
   by a completion from the Send Queue or a completion from the 
   Receive Queue. In the former, the attacker is the local ULP. In 
   the latter, the attacker is the Remote Peer. 

   A form of attack can occur where the local ULPs can consume 
   resources on the CQ. A local ULP that is slow to free resources 
   on the CQ by not reaping the completion status quickly enough 
   could stall all other local ULPs attempting to use that CQ. 

   For these reasons, an RNIC MUST NOT enable sharing a CQ across 
   ULPs that do not share Partial Mutual Trust. 

7.2  Local Peer Attacking the RDMA Read Request Queue 

   If RDMA Read Request Queue resources are pooled across multiple 
   Streams, one attack is if the local ULP attempts to unfairly 
   allocate RDMA Read Request Queue resources for its Streams. For 
   example, a local ULP attempts to allocate all available resources 
   on a specific RDMA Read Request Queue for its Streams, thereby 
   denying the resource to ULPs sharing the RDMA Read Request Queue. 
   The same type of argument applies even if the RDMA Read Request 
   is not shared - but a local ULP attempts to allocate all of the 
   RNIC's resources when the queue is created. 

   Thus access to interfaces that allocate RDMA Read Request Queue 
   entries MUST be restricted to a trusted Local Peer, such as a 
   Privileged Resource Manager. The Privileged Resource Manager 
   SHOULD prevent a local ULP from allocating more than its fair 
   share of resources.

11 Appendix A: ULP Issues for RDDP Client/Server Protocols 

   This section is a normative appendix to the document that is 
   focused on client/server ULP implementation requirements to 
   ensure a secure server implementation. 

   The prior sections outlined specific attacks and their 
   countermeasures. This section summarizes the attacks and 
   countermeasures that have been defined in the prior section which 
   are applicable to creation of a secure ULP (e.g. application) 
   server. A ULP server is defined as a ULP which must be able to 
   communicate with many clients which do not necessarily have a 
   trust relationship with each other, and ensure that each client 
   can not attack another client through server interactions. 
   Further, the server may wish to use multiple Streams to 
   communicate with a specific client, and those Streams may share 
   mutual trust. Note that this section assumes a compliant RNIC and 
   Privileged Resource Manager implementation - thus it focuses 
   specifically on ULP server (e.g. application) implementation 
   issues.  

   All of the prior section's details on attacks and countermeasures 
   apply to the server, thus requirements which are repeated in this 
   section use non-normative "must", "should", "may". In some cases 
   normative SHOULD statements for the ULP from the main body of 
   this document are made MUST statements for the ULP server because 
   the operating conditions can be refined to make the motives for a 
   SHOULD inapplicable. If a prior SHOULD is changed to a MUST in 
   this section, it is explicitly noted and it uses upper-case 
   normative statements.  

   The following list summarizes the relevant attacks that clients 
   can mount on the shared server, by re-stating the previous 
   normative statements to be client/server specific. Note that each 
   client/server ULP may employ explicit RDMA operations (RDMA Read, 
   RDMA Write) in differing fashions. Therefore where appropriate, 
   "Local ULP", "Local Peer" and "Remote Peer" are used in place of 
   "server" or "client", in order to retain full generality of each 
   requirement. 

       *   Spoofing 

           *   Sections 5.1.1 to 5.1.3. For protection against many 
               forms of spoofing attacks, enable IPsec. 

           *   Section 6.1.1 Using an STag on a Different Stream. To 
               ensure that one client can not access another 
               client's data via use of the other client's STag, the 
               server ULP must either scope an STag to a single 
               Stream or use a unique Protection Domain per client. 
               If a single client has multiple Streams that share 
               Partial Mutual Trust, then the STag can be shared 


   J. Pinkerton, et al.    Expires - September, 2006        [Page 45]

               between the associated Streams by using a single 
               Protection Domain among the associated Streams (see 
               section 5.4.3 ULPs Which Provide Security for 
               additional issues). To prevent unintended sharing of 
               STags within the associated Streams, a server ULP 
               should use STags in such a fashion that it is 
               difficult to predict the next allocated STag number. 

       *   Tampering 

           *   6.2.2 Modifying a Buffer After Indication. Before the 
               local ULP operates on a buffer that was written by 
               the Remote Peer using an RDMA Write or RDMA Read, the 
               local ULP MUST ensure the buffer can no longer be 
               modified, by invalidating the STag for remote access 
               (note that this is stronger than the SHOULD in 
               section 6.2.2). This can either be done explicitly by 
               revoking remote access rights for the STag when the 
               Remote Peer indicates the operation has completed, or 
               by checking to make sure the Remote Peer Invalidated 
               the STag through the RDMAP Invalidate capability, and 
               if it did not, the local ULP then explicitly revoking 
               the STag remote access rights. 

       *   Information Disclosure 

           *   6.3.2 Using RDMA Read to Access Stale Data. In a 
               general purpose server environment there is no 
               compelling rationale to not require a buffer to be 
               initialized before remote read is enabled (and an 
               enormous down side of unintentionally sharing data). 
               Thus a local ULP MUST (this is stronger than the 
               SHOULD in section 6.3.2) ensure that no stale data is 
               contained in a buffer before remote read access 
               rights are granted to a Remote Peer (this can be done 
               by zeroing the contents of the memory, for example). 

           *   6.3.3 Accessing a Buffer After the Transfer. This 
               mitigation is already covered by section 6.2.2 
               (above). 

           *   6.3.4 Accessing Unintended Data With a Valid STag. 
               The ULP must set the base and bounds of the buffer 
               when the STag is initialized to expose only the data 
               to be retrieved. 

           *   6.3.5 RDMA Read into an RDMA Write Buffer. If a peer 
               only intends a buffer to be exposed for remote write 
               access, it must set the access rights to the buffer 
               to only enable remote write access.

           *   6.3.6 Using Multiple STags Which Alias to the Same 
               Buffer. The requirement in section 6.1.1 (above) 
               mitigates this attack. A server buffer is exposed to 
               only one client at a time to ensure that no 
               information disclosure or information tampering 
               occurs between peers. 

           *   5.3  - Network Based Eavesdropping. Confidentiality 
               services should be enabled by the ULP if this threat 
               is a concern. 

       *   Denial of Service 

           *   6.4.3.1 Multiple Streams Sharing Receive Buffers. ULP 
               memory footprint size can be important for some 
               server ULPs. If a server ULP is expecting significant 
               network traffic from multiple clients, using a 
               receive buffer queue per Stream where there is a 
               large number of Streams can consume substantial 
               amounts of memory. Thus a receive queue that can be 
               shared by multiple Streams is attractive.  
                
               However, because of the attacks outlined in this 
               section, sharing a single receive queue between 
               multiple clients must only be done if a mechanism is 
               in place to ensure one client cannot consume receive 
               buffers in excess of its limits, as defined by each 
               ULP. For multiple Streams within a single client ULP 
               (which presumably shared Partial Mutual Trust) this 
               added overhead may be avoided. 

           *   7.1 Local ULP Attacking a Shared CQ. The normative 
               RNIC mitigations require the RNIC to not enable 
               sharing of a CQ if the local ULPs do not share 
               Partial Mutual Trust. Thus while the ULP is not 
               allowed to enable this feature in an unsafe mode, if 
               the two local ULPs share Partial Mutual Trust, they 
               must behave in the following manner: 
                
               1) The sizing of the completion queue is based on the 
               size of the receive queue and send queues as 
               documented in 6.4.3.2 Remote or Local Peer Attacking 
               a Shared CQ. 
                
               2) The local ULP ensures that CQ entries are reaped 
               frequently enough to adhere to section 6.4.3.2's 
               rules.     

           *   6.4.3.2 Remote or Local Peer Attacking a Shared CQ. 
               There are two mitigations specified in this section - 
               one requires a worst-case size of the CQ, and can be 
               implemented entirely within the Privileged Resource 


   J. Pinkerton, et al.    Expires - September, 2006        [Page 47] 
   Internet-Draft             RDDP/RDMAP Security        March, 2006 

               Manager. The second approach requires cooperation 
               with the local ULP server (to not post too many 
               buffers), and enables a smaller CQ to be used.  
                
               In some server environments, partial trust of the 
               server ULP (but not the clients) is acceptable, thus 
               the smaller CQ fully mitigates the remote attacker. 
               In other environments, the local server ULP could 
               also contain untrusted elements which can attack the 
               local machine (or have bugs). In those environments, 
               the worst-case size of the CQ must be used. 

           *   6.4.3.3 The section requires a server's Privileged 
               Resource Manager to not allow sharing of RDMA Read 
               Request Queues across multiple Streams that do not 
               share Partial Mutual Trust, for a ULP which performs 
               RDMA Read operations to server buffers. However, 
               because the server ULP knows best which of its 
               Streams share Partial Mutual Trust, this requirement 
               can be reflected back to the ULP. The ULP (i.e. 
               server) requirement in this case is that it MUST NOT 
               allow RDMA Read Request Queues to be shared between 
               ULPs which do not have Partial Mutual Trust.    

           *   6.4.5 Remote Invalidate an STag Shared on Multiple 
               Streams. This mitigation is already covered by 
               section 6.2.2 (above).

13 Appendix C: Partial Trust Taxonomy 

   This appendix is informative. 

   Partial Trust is defined as when one party is willing to assume 
   that another party will refrain from a specific attack or set of 
   attacks, the parties are said to be in a state of Partial Trust. 
   Note that the partially trusted peer may attempt a different set 
   of attacks. This may be appropriate for many ULPs where any 
   adverse effects of the betrayal is easily confined and does not 
   place other clients or ULPs at risk. 

   The Trust Models described in this section have three primary 
   distinguishing characteristics. The Trust Model refers to a local 
   ULP and Remote Peer, which are intended to be the local and 
   remote ULP instances communicating via RDMA/DDP. 

       *   Local Resource Sharing (yes/no) - When local resources 
           are shared, they are shared across a grouping of 
           RDMAP/DDP Streams. If local resources are not shared, the 
           resources are dedicated on a per Stream basis. Resources 
           are defined in Section 2.2 - Resources. The advantage of 
           not sharing resources between Streams is that it reduces 
           the types of attacks that are possible. The disadvantage 
           is that ULPs might run out of resources. 

       *   Local Partial Trust (yes/no) - Local Partial Trust is 
           determined based on whether the local grouping of 
           RDMAP/DDP Streams (which typically equates to one ULP or 
           group of ULPs) mutually trust each other to not perform a 
           specific set of attacks.  

       *   Remote Partial Trust (yes/no) - The Remote Partial Trust 
           level is determined based on whether the local ULP of a 
           specific RDMAP/DDP Stream partially trusts the Remote 
           Peer of the Stream (see the definition of Partial Trust 
           in Section 1 Introduction).  

   Not all of the combinations of the trust characteristics are 
   expected to be used by ULPs. This document specifically analyzes 
   five ULP Trust Models that are expected to be in common use. The 
   Trust Models are as follows: 

       *   NS-NT - Non-Shared Local Resources, no Local Trust, no 
           Remote Trust - typically a server ULP that wants to run 
           in the safest mode possible. All attack mitigations are 
           in place to ensure robust operation. 

       *   NS-RT - Non-Shared Local Resources, no Local Trust, 
           Remote Partial Trust - typically a peer-to-peer ULP, 
           which has, by some method outside of the scope of this 
           document, authenticated the Remote Peer. Note that unless 


   J. Pinkerton, et al.    Expires - September, 2006        [Page 51] 
   Internet-Draft             RDDP/RDMAP Security        March, 2006 

           some form of key based authentication is used on a per 
           RDMA/DDP Stream basis, it may not be possible be possible 
           for man-in-the-middle attacks to occur. 

       *   S-NT - Shared Local Resources, no Local Trust, no Remote 
           Trust - typically a server ULP that runs in an untrusted 
           environment where the amount of resources required is 
           either too large or too dynamic to dedicate for each 
           RDMAP/DDP Stream. 

       *   S-LT - Shared Local Resources, Local Partial Trust, no 
           Remote Trust - typically a ULP, which provides a session 
           layer and uses multiple Streams, to provide additional 
           throughput or fail-over capabilities. All of the Streams 
           within the local ULP partially trust each other, but do 
           not trust the Remote Peer. This trust model may be 
           appropriate for embedded environments. 

       *   S-T - Shared Local Resources, Local Partial Trust, Remote 
           Partial Trust - typically a distributed application, such 
           as a distributed database application or a High 
           Performance Computer (HPC) application, which is intended 
           to run on a cluster. Due to extreme resource and 
           performance requirements, the application typically 
           authenticates with all of its peers and then runs in a 
           highly trusted environment. The application peers are all 
           in a single application fault domain and depend on one 
           another to be well-behaved when accessing data 
           structures. If a trusted Remote Peer has an 
           implementation defect that results in poor behavior, the 
           entire application could be corrupted.  

   Models NS-NT and S-NT above are typical for Internet networking - 
   neither local ULPs nor the Remote Peer is trusted. Sometimes 
   optimizations can be done that enable sharing of Page Translation 
   Tables across multiple local ULPs, thus Model S-LT can be 
   advantageous. Model S-T is typically used when resource scaling 
   across a large parallel ULP makes it infeasible to use any other 
   model. Resource scaling issues can either be due to performance 
   around scaling or because there simply are not enough resources. 
   Model NS-RT is probably the least likely model to be used, but is 
   presented for completeness.
