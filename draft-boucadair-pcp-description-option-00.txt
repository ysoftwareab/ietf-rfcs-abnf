Internet-Draft           PCP Description Option           September 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document extends the base PCP [I-D.ietf-pcp-base] with the
   ability to associate a description with a PCP-instantiated mapping:
   DESCRIPTION Option.

      Existing implementations use 0x40 (64) as code point for this
      option.

   This option can be used in the context of
   [I-D.ietf-pcp-upnp-igd-interworking].

   This option has been defined first in [I-D.boucadair-pcp-extensions].


2.  Format

   This option can be used by a user to indicate a description
   associated with a given mapping such as "My mapping for my FTP
   server" or "My remote access to my CP router", etc.  In addition, in
   the some deployment scenarios, this field can be used for
   troubleshooting purposes and can be used to convey values as the ones
   listed hereafter:

   o  "This is the mapping for my specific IPsec implementation"

   o  "This is the mapping for subscriber bob@example.com"

   o  "This is the mapping for special subscriber
      adsl-line-1234@example.com"

   o  "This is the mapping that failed before due to XYZ"

   Issues related to the usage of this field for troubleshooting or for
   any further usage are out of scope of this document.

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

        This Option:

         Option Name: Description Option (DESCRIPTION)
         Number: TBA (IANA)
                 Existing implementations use 0x40
         Purpose: Used to associate a text description with a mapping
         Valid for Opcodes: MAP, PEER
         Length: Variable
         May appear in: both request and response
         Maximum occurrences: 1


                       Figure 1: Description Option


3.  Behaviour

   This option is optional to be supported by PCP Servers and PCP
   Clients.  This option (Code TBA, Figure 1) MAY be included in a PCP
   MAP/PEER request to include a description associated with a requested
   mapping.

   The maximum length SHOULD be a configurable option in the PCP Server.
   If a PCP Client includes a DESCRIPTION PCP option with a length
   exceeding the maximum length supported by the PCP Server, only the
   portion of the DESCRIPTION field fitting that maximum length is
   stored by the PCP Server.


4.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations discussed in [I-D.ietf-pcp-base] must be
   considered.


5.  IANA Considerations

   The following PCP Option Codes are to be allocated:
