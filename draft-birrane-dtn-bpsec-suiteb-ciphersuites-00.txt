1.  Introduction

   This document specifies ciphersuites to be used with Bundle Protocol
   Security (BPSec) [I-D.ietf-dtn-bpsec].  These suites provide
   compatibility with the United States National Security Agency's Suite
   B specifications.

   This document is an update to the Suite-B profile created by Burgin
   and Hennessy [I-D.hennessy-bsp-suiteb-ciphersuites].  This update
   adapts the profile from BSP [RFC6257] to BPSec.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

3.  Suite B Ciphersuites

3.1.  Overview

   This section defines new ciphersuites for use with the security block
   types BIB and BCB.  The BIB ciphersuites are based on digital
   signatures using ECDSA.  The BCB ciphersuites use ECDH for key
   agreement, AES in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) for content encryption,
   and AES Key Wrap for key encryption.  All proposed ciphersuites use
   SHA-256 or SHA-384 as the hash algorithm.

   The ciphersuites use the mechanisms defined in Cryptographic Message
   Syntax (CMS) [RFC5652] for packaging the keys, signatures, etc., for
   transport in the appropriate security block.  Additionally, the
   ciphersuites follow the guidance and requirements of RFC 6318

   [RFC6318] which specifies the conventions for using Suite B
   algorithms in Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME).

   CMS values are generated using ASN.1 [X.208-88], the Basic Encoding
   Rules (BER) [X.209-88], and the Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER)
   [X.509-88].

3.2.  Suites BIB-ECDSA-SHA256 and BIB-ECDSA-SHA384

   The BIB-ECDSA-SHA256 ciphersuite has ciphersuite ID value 0xB1, and
   the BIB-ECDSA-SHA384 ciphersuite has ciphersuite ID value 0xB2.

   In BIB-ECDSA-SHA256, ECDSA MUST be used with the SHA-256 message
   digest algorithm and the P-256 elliptic curve, as specified in
   [RFC6318].  In BIB-ECDSA-SHA384, ECDSA MUST be used with the SHA-384
   message digest algorithm and the P-384 elliptic curve, as specified
   in [RFC6318].  The P-256 and P-384 elliptic curves are specified in
   [DSS].

   The SHA-256 and SHA-384 message digest algorithms are defined in FIPS
   Pub 180-3 [RFC5754].  The algorithm identifiers for SHA-256 and
   SHA-384 are defined in [RFC5754].  RFC 5754 specifies the conventions
   for using SHA-256 and SHA-384 with CMS.  Within the CMS signed-data
   content type, message digest algorithm identifiers are located in the
   SignedData digestAlgorithms field and the SignerInfo digestAlgorithm
   field.

   RFC 5753 [RFC5753] specifies the conventions for using ECDSA with
   CMS.  RFC 5480 [RFC5480] defines the signature algorithm identifiers
   used in CMS for ECDSA with SHA-256 and ECDSA with SHA-384.  Relevant
   details are repeated here.

   Within the CMS signed-data content type, signature algorithm
   identifiers are located in the SignerInfo signatureAlgorithm field of
   SignedData.  In addition, signature algorithm identifiers are located
   in the SignerInfo signatureAlgorithm field of countersignature
   attributes.  When either signature algorithm identifier is used, the
   AlgorithmIdentifier parameters field MUST be absent.

   When signing, the ECDSA algorithm generates two values, commonly
   called r and s.  To transfer these two values as one signature, they
   MUST be encoded using the ECDSA-Sig-Value type specified in RFC 5480
   [RFC5480].

   Because the signature field in SignedData SignatureValue is a
   security-result field, the entire key-information item MUST be placed
   in the BIB's security-result field, rather than security- parameters.

3.3.  Suites BCB-ECDH-SHA256-AES128 and BCB-ECDH-SHA384-AES256

   The BCB-ECDH-SHA256-AES128 ciphersuite has ciphersuite ID value 0xB3,
   and the BCB-ECDH-SHA384-AES256 ciphersuite has ciphersuite ID value
   0xB4.

   These schemes encrypt any block in a bundle except the primary block
   and another BCB block.  Both ciphersuites use ephemeral-static ECDH,
   which means that the security source possesses an ephemeral ECDH key
   pair and the security destination possesses a static ECDH key pair.

   In BCB-ECDH-SHA256-AES128, ephemeral-static ECDH MUST be used with
   the SHA-256 KDF, AES-128 Key Wrap, and the P-256 elliptic curve, as
   specified in [RFC6318].  In BCB-ECDH-SHA384-AES256, ephemeral-static
   ECDH MUST be used with the SHA-384 KDF, AES-256 Key Wrap, and the
   P-384 elliptic curve, as specified in [RFC6318].  The P-256 and P-384
   elliptic curves are specified in [DSS].

   When a key agreement algorithm is used in CMS, a key-encryption
   algorithm is also needed to encrypt the content encryption key (CEK).
   These ciphersuites use Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Key Wrap,
   as specified in RFC 3394 [RFC3394] and [AESWRAP], as the key-
   encryption algorithm.  The key-encryption key used with the AES Key
   Wrap algorithm is obtained from a key derivation function (KDF).
   These ciphersuites use a KDF based on SHA-256 and SHA-384.

   Section 3.1 of RFC 5753 [RFC5753] specifies the conventions for using
   ECDH with CMS.  Here the bundle encryption key (BEK), used to encrypt
   the target block, is the data to be carried in a CMS enveloped-data
   content type.  CMS encrypts the BEK with a freshly generated content
   encryption key (CEK) and the result is placed in the encryptedContent
   field of an EnvelopedData EncryptedContentInfo structure.  The CEK is
   encrypted with the ECDH-generated pairwise key-encryption key (KEK)
   using the AES Key Wrap algorithm.  The result is placed in the
   EnvelopedData RecipientInfos KeyAgreeRecipientInfo
   RecipientEncryptedKey EncryptedKey field.

   Algorithm identifiers needed when using ECDH with CMS are provided in
   RFC 6318 [RFC6318] section 4.  Within the CMS enveloped-data content
   type, the key agreement algorithm identifier is placed in the
   EnvelopedData RecipientInfos KeyAgreeRecipientInfo
   keyEncryptionAlgorithm field.  The key wrap algorithm identifier is
   placed in the KeyWrapAlgorithm parameters within the EnvelopedData
   RecipientInfos KeyAgreeRecipientInfo keyEncryptionAlgorithm field.

   KDFs based on SHA-256 and SHA-384 are used to derive a pairwise key-
   encryption key from the shared secret produced by ephemeral-static
   ECDH.  Section 4.3 of RFC 6318 [RFC6318] specify the conventions for

   using the KDF with the shared secret generated with ephemeral-static
   ECDH with the CMS.

   Target block BSP encryption is done using the AES algorithm in
   Galois/ Counter Mode (GCM) as described in [RFC5084].  For
   consistency with the description in [RFC5084], we refer to the GCM IV
   as a nonce.  The same key and nonce combination MUST NOT be used more
   than once.  The nonce is constructed by concatenating a salt field
   and an initialization vector, as follows.

   The salt field is a four-octet value, usually chosen at random.  The
   salt need not be kept secret.  The initialization vector (IV) is an
   eight-octet value, usually chosen at random.  The value need not be
   kept secret.

   The BEK is a 16-octet (128 bits) value in BCB-ECDH-SHA256-AES128, and
   is a 32-octet value (256 bits) in BCB-ECDH-SHA384-AES256.  The BEK
   SHOULD be chosen randomly and MUST be kept secret.

   The Integrity Check Value (ICV) from the AES-GCM content encryption
   is a 16-octet value used to verify that the protected data has not
   been altered.  Normally, the ICV is concatenated with the ciphertext
   to produce the output of AES-GCM encryption.  However, to avoid
   expansion of the payload, the ICV value is placed in the security-
   result field of the BCB.  The value need not be kept secret.

   Each ciphersuite populates a single BCB in the bundle.  This BCB MUST
   contain security-parameters and security-result fields.  The
   security-parameters field includes the salt, IV, and key-information
   items where the key- information item contains the encrypted BEK
   encoded in a CMS EnvelopedData structure.  The security-results-field
   contains the ICV.  The ciphertext is NOT stored in the BCB, but
   replaces the plaintext from the target block.  The other bytes of the
   target block, such as type, flags, and length, are not modified.

4.  Security Considerations

   Two levels of security may be achieved using this specification.
   Users must consider their risk environment to determine which level
   is appropriate for their own use.

   The security considerations in [I-D.ietf-dtn-bpsec] discuss the BPSec
   Protocol and apply here as well.

   The security considerations in [RFC5652] discuss the CMS as a method
   for digitally signing data and encrypting data.

   The security considerations in [RFC3370] discuss cryptographic
   algorithm implementation concerns in the context of the CMS.

   The security considerations in [RFC5753] discuss the use of elliptic
   curve cryptography (ECC) in the CMS.

   The security considerations in [RFC3565] discuss the use of AES in
   the CMS, and the security considerations in [RFC5084] discuss the
   Galois/Counter Mode.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This protocol has fields that have been registered by IANA.

   The BPSec has a ciphersuite number field and certain ciphersuites are
   defined.  The registration policy for this registry is: Specification
   Required.  The Value range is: Variable Length.

   IANA is requested to assign the following values for the ciphersuite
   number field.

                       Ciphersuite Numbers Registry:

       +-------+--------------------------------------+----------------+
       | Value | Description                          | Reference      |
