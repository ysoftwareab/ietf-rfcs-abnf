1.  Introduction

   There are several situations where it is required for IS-IS routers
   within one area to find correlations between routable IP addresses
   and capabilities of IS-IS routers within another area.  However, in
   the IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV [RFC4971] which is used by IS-IS
   routers to announce their capabilities, there is no field for
   containing routable IP addresses of the originating router.  Although
   TE Router ID sub-TLVs as defined in [RFC5316] are used to carry
   routable IP addresses, these sub-TLVs are specifically designed for
   Traffic-Engineering (TE) purpose.  Therefore, this document propose
   two new sub-TLVs of this CAPABILITY TLV for carrying routable IPv4
   and IPv6 addresses of the router originating the CAPABILITY TLV
   respectively.  These two sub-TLVs could be used for non-TE purpose.
   These routable addresses are typically implemented as "loopback
   addresses".

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   This memo makes use of the terms defined in [RFC4971].

3.  Routable IPv4 Address Sub-TLV

   A new sub-TLV of the IS-IS Router Capability TLV, called Routable
   IPv4 Address sub-TLV is defined to carry one or more routable IPv4
   addresses of the router originating the CAPABILITY TLV.  The Type of
   this sub-TLV is TBD, the Length is variable (multiple of 4), and the

   Value field contains one or more routable IPv4 addresses of the
   router originating the CAPABILITY TLV.  This sub-TLV SHOULD NOT be
   included more than once in an CAPABILITY TLV.  The scope of the
   advertisement depends on the application but it is recommended that
   it SHOULD be domain-wide.  An implementation receiving a Routable
   IPv4 Address sub-TLV defined in this document MUST NOT consider the
   routable IPv4 address(es) contained in such sub-TLV in the standard
   SPF calculation because this can lead to forwarding loops when
   interacting with systems that do not support this sub-TLV.

4.  Routable IPv6 Address Sub-TLV

   A new sub-TLV of the IS-IS Router Capability TLV, called Routable
   IPv6 Address sub-TLV is defined to carry one or more routable IPv6
   global addresses of the router originating the CAPABILITY TLV.  The
   Type of this sub-TLV is TBD, the Length is variable (multiple of 16),
   and the Value field contains one or more routable IPv6 global address
   of the router originating the CAPABILITY TLV.  This sub-TLV SHOULD
   NOT be included more than once in an CAPABILITY TLV.  The scope of
   the advertisement depends on the application but it is recommended
   that it SHOULD be domain-wide.  An implementation receiving a
   Routable IPv6 Address sub-TLV defined in this document MUST NOT
   consider the routable IPv6 address(es) contained in such sub-TLV in
   the standard SPF calculation because this can lead to forwarding
   loops when interacting with systems that do not support this sub-TLV.

5.  Acknowledgements

   Thanks Karsten Thomann, Anton Smirnov, Joel Jaeggli, Joel Halpern,
   Les Ginsberg, Wes George and Acee Lindem for their valuable comments
   on the initial idea of this draft.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes a request to IANA to allocate two sub-TLV type
   codes within the IS-IS Router Capability TLV for the Routable IPv4
   Address Sub-TLV and the Routable IPv6 Address Sub-TLV respectively.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any new security risk.
