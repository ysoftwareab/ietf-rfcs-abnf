1.  Introduction

   Users of telephone-like services expect to be able to call for
   emergency help, such as police, the fire department or an ambulance,
   regardless of where they are, what (if any) service provider they are
   using and what kind of device they are using.  Unfortunately, the
   mechanisms for emergency calls that have evolved in the public
   circuit-switched telephone network (PSTN) are not quite appropriate
   for evolving IP-based voice, text and real-time multimedia
   communications.  This document outlines the key requirements that end
   systems and network elements such as SIP proxies need to satisfy in
   order to provide emergency call services that offer at least the same
   functionality as existing PSTN services, with the goal of making
   emergency calling more robust, cheaper to implement and multimedia-
   capable.

   In the future, users of other real-time and near real-time services
   may also expect to be able to summon emergency help.  For example,
   instant messaging (IM) users may want to use such services.  IM is
   particularly helpful for hearing-disabled users (RFC 3351 [3]) and in
   cases where bandwidth is scarce.

   This document only focuses on end-to-end IP-based calls, i.e., where
   the emergency call originates from an IP end system, (Internet
   device), and terminates to an IP-capable PSAP, done entirely over an
   IP network.

   This document identifies functional and security issues for
   determining the correct emergency identifier, for identifying the
   appropriate IPSAP (emergency address) and for identifying the caller
   and its current location.

   Emergency calls need to be identified (Section 6).  Emergency
   identifiers are used by the emergency caller to declare a call to be
   an emergency call.  The device MUST recognize the emergency
   identifiers used and convert them to an emergency address to guide
   the call to a PSAP.  The emergency address MUST be a predefined
   "sip", "sips" or "tel" URI scheme.

   Emergency calls need to be routed to the appropriate PSAP (ref.
   Section 6).  Several terms are used for causing the call signaling to
   reach the geographically appropriate PSAP.  This has been referred to
   as call routing, (PSAP) lookup or location mapping, all capturing
   aspects of the problem.

   Emergency calls need to identify who placed the call (Section 7).  In
   most jurisdictions, callers do not have a choice as to whether they
   want to reveal their location or identity; such disclosure is

Internet-Draft             ECRIT requirements                   May 2005


   typically mandated by law.

   Emergency calls need to identify the location from which the call is
   initiated (Section 5).  The caller location needs to be identified
   for two purposes, namely to route the call to the appropriate PSAP
   and to display the caller location to the call taker to simplify
   dispatching emergency assistance to the correct location.

   Emergency calls may not be subject to access restrictions placed on
   non-emergency calls.  Also, some call features may interfere with
   emergency calls, particularly if triggered accidentally (Section 7).

2.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUSTNOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALLNOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULDNOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1] and
   indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations.

   Since a requirements document does not directly specify an
   implementable protocols, these compliance labels should be read as
   indicating requirements for the protocol or architecture, rather than
   an implementation.

   For lack of a better term, we will use the term "caller" or
   "emergency caller" to refer to the person placing an emergency call
   or sending an emergency IM.

   Access Infrastructure Provider (AIP): An organization that provides
      physical network connectivity to its customers or users, e.g.,
      through digital subscriber lines, cable TV plants, Ethernet,
      leased lines or radio frequencies.  This entity may or may not
      also provide IP routing, IP addresses, or other Internet protocol
      services.  Examples of such organizations include
      telecommunication carriers, municipal utilities, larger
      enterprises with their own network infrastructure, and government
      organizations such as the military.

   address: A description of a location of a person, organization, or
      building, most often consisting of numerical and text elements
      such as street number, street name, and city arranged in a
      particular format.

   Application (Voice) Service Provider (ASP, VSP): The organization
      that provides voice or other application-layer services, such as
      call routing, a SIP URI or PSTN termination.  This organization
      can be a private individual, an enterprise, a government or a
      service provider.  We avoid the term voice service provider as
      emergency calls are likely to use other media, including text and
      video, in the future.  For a particular user, the ASP may not be
      the same organization as the AIP or ISP.

   basic emergency service: Basic emergency service allows a user to
      reach a PSAP serving its current location, but the PSAP may not be
      able to determine the identity or geographic location of the
      caller (except by having the call taker ask the caller).

Internet-Draft             ECRIT requirements                   May 2005


   call taker: A call taker is an agent at the PSAP that accepts calls
      and may dispatch emergency help.  (Sometimes the functions of call
      taking and dispatching are handled by different groups of people,
      but these divisions of labor are not generally visible to the
      outside and thus do not concern us here.)

   civic location: A described location based on some defined grid, such
      as a jurisdictional, postal, metropolitan, or rural reference
      system (e.g. street address).

   domain: An area or group of services falling with in a specific
      category or jurisdictional boundary.

      [Ed. need further clarification for "domain"]

   domain authentication and validation entity: A node that has
      authority within a given domain to authenticate and validate user
      location information.

   Emergency Control Center (ECC): Facilities used by emergency
      organizations to accept and handle emergency calls.  A PSAP
      (below) forwards emergency calls to the emergency control center,
      which dispatches police, fire, rescue and other emergency
      services.  An ECC serves a limited geographic area.  A PSAP and
      ECC can be combined into one facility (ETSI SR 002 180
      definition).  We assume that the ECC is reachable by IP-based
      protocols, such as SIP for call signaling and RTP for media.

   emergency address: The  sip:uri, sips:uri, or tel:uri which
      represents the network address of the IPSAP useful for the
      completion of a VoIP emergency call.

   emergency caller: The user or user device entity needing sending his/
      her location to another entity in the network.

   emergency identifier: The  numerical and/or text identifier which is
      supplied by a user or a user device, which identifies the call as
      an emergency call and is translated into an emergency address for
      call routing and completion.

   enhanced emergency service: Enhanced emergency services add the
      ability to identify the caller identity and/or caller location to
      basic emergency services.  (Sometimes, only the caller location
      may be known, e.g., from a public access point that is not owned
      by an individual.)

Internet-Draft             ECRIT requirements                   May 2005


   geocoding: The process of finding the location of a street address on
      a map.  The location can be an x,y coordinate or a feature such as
      a street segment, postal delivery location, or building.  In GIS,
      geocoding requires a reference dataset that contains address
      attributes for the geographic features in the area of interest.

   geographic coordinates: A representation (measurement) of a location
      on the earth's surface expressed in degrees of latitude and
      longitude.

   geographic coordinate system: A reference system that uses latitude
      and longitude to define the locations of points on the surface of
      a sphere or spheroid.

   geographic transformation: A method of converting data between two
      geographic coordinate systems (datums).

   geographic location: A reference to a locatable point described by a
      set of defined coordinates within a gegraphic coordinate system,
      (e.g. lat/lon within  WGS-84 datum)

   Internet Service Provider (ISP): An organization that provides IP
      network-layer services to its customers or users.  This entity may
      or may not provide the physical-layer and layer-2 connectivity,
      such as fiber or Ethernet.

   location: A geographic identification assigned to a region or feature
      based on a specific coordinate system, or by other precise
      information such as a street address.  In the geocoding process,
      the location is defined with an x,y coordinate value according to
      the distance north or south of the equator and east or west of the
      prime meridian.

   Location Key (LK): A key identifier used to query a location server
      in order to retrieve a specific end user or end user device
      location.

   location validation: A caller location is considered valid if the
      civic or geographic location is recognizable within an acceptable
      location reference systems (e.g.  USPS, WGS84, etc.), and can be
      mapped to one or more PSAPs.  Location validation ensures that a
      location is referencable, but makes no assumption about the
      association between the caller and the caller's location.

   PSAP (Public Safety Answering Point): Physical location where
      emergency calls are received under the responsibility of a public
      authority.  (This terminology is used by both ETSI, in ETSI SR 002
      180, and NENA.)  In the United Kingdom, PSAPs are called Operator

      Assistance Centres, in New Zealand Communications Centres.

   IPSAP (IP-PSAP): PSAP which supports the receipt of emergency calls
      over IP.  It is assumed that the PSAP is reachable by IP-based
      protocols, such as SIP for call signaling and RTP for media.

   x,y coordinates: A pair of values that represents the distance from
      an origin (0,0) along two axes, a horizontal axis (x) representing
      east-west, and a vertical axis (y) representing north-south.  On a
      map, x,y coordinates are used to represent features at the
      location they are found on the earth's spherical surface.

3.  High-Level Requirements

   Below, we summarize high-level architectural requirements that guide
   some of the component requirements detailed later in the document.

   R1.  Application Service Provider:  The existence of a Application
      Service Provider (ASP) MUST NOT be assumed.

      [Ed.  Changed from "voice" to "Application" based on stastny
      comment (email 4/28).]

      Motivation: The caller may not have a voice service provider,
      i.e., a corporate entity that provides voice services as a
      business.  For example, a residence may have its own DNS domain
      and run its own SIP proxy server for that domain.  On a larger
      scale, a university might provide voice services to its students
      and staff, but not be a telecommunication provider.

   R2.  International:  The protocols and protocol extensions developed
      MUST support regional, political and organizational differences.

      Motivation: It must be possible for a device or software developed
      or purchased in one country to place emergency calls in another
      country.  System components should not be biased towards a
      particular set of emergency numbers or languages.  Also, different
      countries have evolved different ways of organizing emergency
      services, e.g., either centralizing them or having smaller
      regional subdivisions such as United States counties or
      municipalities handle emergency calls.

   R3.  Distributed Administration:  Deployment of emergency services
      MUST NOT depend on a sole central administration authority.

      Motivation: Once common standards are established, it must be
      possible to deploy and administer emergency calling features on a
      regional or national basis without requiring coordination with
      other regions or nations.  The system cannot assume, for example,
      that there is a single global entity issuing certificates for
      PSAPs, ASPs, AIPs or other participants.

   R4.  Multiple Modes:  Multiple communication modes, including
      Multimedia data and services SHOULD/MUST be supported.

      Motivation: Emergency calling must support a variety of media, not
      just voice and TDD (telecommunication device for the deaf) beyond
      the capabilities of  current limitations.  Such additional media
      should include conversational text, instant messaging and video.
      In addition, it should be possible to convey telemetry data, such



Schulzrinne & Marshall    Expires November 6, 2005              [Page 9]

Internet-Draft             ECRIT requirements                   May 2005


      as data from automobile crash sensors.

      [Ed.  Need to decide whether it's SHOULD or MUST.]

   R5.  Minimum Connectivity:  NEED REQUIREMENT HERE

      Motivation:  If there is network connectivity between the
      emergency caller and the PSAP, and routing information is
      available, the call should be completed, even if other parts of
      the network are not reachable.

      [Ed.  Don't understand above statement, request clarification of
      requirement.]

   R6.  Incremental Deployment Emergency calls from IP-based devices
      MUST be incrementally supported.

      Motivation:  Any mechanism must be deployable incrementally and
      work even if not all entities support IP-based emergency calling.
      For example, User agents conforming to the SIP specification [1],
      but unaware of this document, must be able to place emergency
      calls, possibly with restricted functionality.

      [Ed. changed above paragraph to make non-SIP specific]

   R7.  Middlebox Reliance:  For a transient time the device and the UA
      MAY use the help of servers (e.g.  ESRP) to provide the
      connectivity to ECC, especially for ECC not yet connected to the
      Internet.

      Motivation:  Emergency calling mechanisms must support existing
      emergency call centers based on circuit-switched technology as
      well as future ECCs that are IP-enabled.

Internet-Draft             ECRIT requirements                   May 2005


4.  Emergency Address

   A1.  Universal: Each device and all network elements MUST recognize
      one or more universal (global) emergency identifiers, regardless
      of the location of the device, the service provider used (if any)
      or other factors.  Examples of these might include: 911, 112, and
      sos.*

      [Ed.  The above examples of 911 and 112, per stastny email on
      4/13.  This changes the definition of Local, A2, below]

      Motivation:  SIP and other call signaling protocols are not
      specific to one country or service provider and devices are likely
      to be used across national or service provider boundaries.  Since
      services such as disabling mandatory authentication for emergency
      calls requires the cooperation of outbound proxies, the outbound
      proxy has to be able to recognize the emergency address and be
      assured that it will be routed as an emergency call.  Thus, a
      simple declaration on a random URI that it is an emergency call
      will likely lead to fraud and possibly attacks on the network
      infrastructure.  A universal address also makes it possible to
      create user interface elements that are correctly configured
      without user intervention.  UA features could be made to work
      without such an identifier, but the user interface would then have
      to provide an unambiguous way to declare a particular call an
      emergency call.

   A2.  Local: Since many countries have already deployed national
      emergency identifiers, such as 911 in North America and 112 in
      large parts of Europe, UAs, proxies and call routers MUST
      recognize these universal emergency identifiers, but MAY NOT
      recognize lower level local emergency identifiers, including those
      such as 999, 122, 133, etc.  In addition, these same call routing
      entities SHOULD recognize emergency identifiers that are used in
      other jurisdictions

      [Ed.  Changed "emergency numbers" to "emergency identifiers" (see
      Terminology section)]

      [Ed.  Changed from "found elsewhere" to "used in other
      jurisdictions".]

      [Ed.  The requirement A2 is really a set of 3 requirements, and
      needs to have the question answered which is: "what does the term
      "local" mean?".]






Schulzrinne & Marshall    Expires November 6, 2005             [Page 11]

Internet-Draft             ECRIT requirements                   May 2005


      [Ed.  Suggest rewriting A2 as follows: "IP-based components,
      (including UAs, proxies, and call routers) MAY NOT recognize lower
      level emergency identifiers which are specific to a local
      geographic area (i.e. non-universal).]

      Motivation:  The latter requirement is meant to help travelers
      that may not know the local emergency number and instinctively
      dial the number they are used to from home.  However, it is
      unlikely that all systems could be programmed to recognize any
      emergency number used anywhere as some of these numbers are used
      for non-emergency purposes, in particular extensions and service
      numbers.

   A3.  Recognizable: Emergency calls MUST be recognizable by user
      agents, proxies and other network elements.  To prevent fraud, an
      address identified as an emergency number for call features or
      authentication override MUST also cause routing to a PSAP.

      [Ed. (repeat) Changed "emergency number" to "emergency
      identifier"]

      [Ed.  Request clarification/rewording as to meaning of statement,
      "an address identified as an emergency number"]

   A4.  Minimal configuration: Any local emergency identifiers SHOULD be
      configured automatically, without user intervention.

      Motivation:  A new UA "unofficially imported" into an organization
      from elsewhere should have the same emergency capabilities as one
      officially installed.

   A5.  Secure configuration: Devices SHOULD be assured of the
      correctness of the local emergency numbers that are automatically
      configured.

      Motivation:  If we assume a fixed, global emergency service
      identifier that requires no configuration and only configure local
      "traditional" emergency numbers, users are not likely to suddenly
      dial some random number if a rogue configuration server introduces
      this as an additional emergency number.  The ability to override
      all locally configured emergency identifiers is of more concern.

      [Ed.  Changed from "emergency number" to "emergency identifiers" ]

   A6.  Backwards-compatible: Existing devices that predate the
      specification of emergency call-related protocols and conventions
      MUST be able reach a PSAP.

Internet-Draft             ECRIT requirements                   May 2005


   A7.  Common Identifier:  User initiated requests using local
      initiation methods (e.g. 9-1-1) MUST be supported across non-local
      domains (e.g. foreign countries).

      [Ed.  Clarification sought on whether 9-1-1 equates to "local" or
      "universal"]

      Motivation:  While traveling, users must be able to use their
      familiar "home" emergency identifier.  Users should also be able
      to dial the local emergency number in the country they are
      visiting.

5.  Identifying the Caller Location

   This section supplements the requirements outlined in RFC 3693 [4].
   Thus, the requirements enumerated there are not repeated here.  In
   general, we can distinguish three modes of operation:

   UA-inserted: The caller's user agent inserts the location
      information, derived from sources such as GPS, DHCP or link-layer
      announcements (LLDP).

   UA-referenced: The caller's user agent provides a reference, via a
      permanent or temporary identifier, to the location which is stored
      by a location service somewhere else and then retrieved by the
      PSAP.

   Proxy-inserted: A proxy along the call path inserts the location or
      location reference.

   L1.  Multiple location services: For UA-referenced locations, PSAPs
      MUST be able to access different location providers.  The location
      provider may be tied to the ASP, AIP or ISP or may be independent
      of these entities.

      Motivation:  This requirement avoids that all users have to rely
      on a single location service provider.  This requirement is hard
      to avoid if there are no traditional national application-layer
      service providers.

   L2.  Civic and Geographic: Where available, both civic (street
      address) and geographic (longitude/latitude) information SHOULD be
      provided to the PSAP.

      Motivation:  While geographic coordinate information can usually
      be translated into civic address location information, some
      specific information, such as building number and floor, is more
      easily provided as civic location information since it does not
      require a detailed surveying operation.  For direct location
      determination, it may also be easier for the user to check civic
      location information to assure verity.

   L3.  Location source identification: The source of a location data,
      whether measured, derived (e.g geocoding or reverse geocoding
      transformation), or manually input, MUST be indicated to the PSAP.
      (Transformations include coordinate conversions from one datum to
      another (e.g.  NAD83 to WGS84).

Internet-Draft             ECRIT requirements                   May 2005


      Motivation:  This allows the PSAP to better judge the reliability
      and accuracy of the data and track down problems.

   L4.  Certifiable: In some cases, the source and generation time of
      the location object used for call routing and caller location
      display MUST be verifiable, e.g., by a digital signature.  The
      security requirements describe this in more detail.

      [Ed.  Clarification sought, e.g.  "In some cases...  MUST be
      verifiable..."? (sounds like we're saying MAY rather than MUST)

   L5.  Multiple locations: Multiple locations MAY be associated with
      the caller

      Motivation:  Multiple locations may occur either because the
      caller has provided more than one civic or geographic
      (coordinates) location, supplies both civic and geospatial
      location information, or because different location determination
      entities make different assessments of the caller's location."

   L6.  Validation of civic location: It MUST be possible to validate an
      address prior to its use in an actual emergency call.

   L7.  Provide location: Calls using VoIP or subsequent methods MUST
      supply location with the call.

   L8.  Accept two location types: PSAPs shall accept location as civic
      and/or geo specified.

      [Ed.  Suggest deleting above requirement since it doesn't deal
      with routing]

   L9.  Altitude included with location: All representations of location
      SHALL include the ability to carry altitude.  This requirement
      does not imply altitude is always used or supplied.

   L10.  Preferred datum: The preferred geographic coordinate system for
      emergency calls SHALL be WGS-84.

   L11.  Multiple locations: If multiple locations are provided with a
      call, it SHOULD be possible to identify the most accurate,
      current, appropriate location information to be used for routing
      emergency calls and dispatching emergency responders.

   L12.  Location presenter: No assumption SHALL be made that the entity
      presenting the call to the PSAP has any knowledge of, or control
      over the provider of location.

      Motivation:  The location provider may be independent of all other
      service providers handling the call.

   L13.  Updated location: Location updates MUST be supported

      Motivation:  The ability to update a location is essential for
      support of mobility use cases.

   L14.  Imprecise location: Imprecise location information MUST be
      available for emergency call routing and location delivery in
      cases where precise measurement based location determination
      mechanisms fail.

      Motivation:  Examples of rough location include coordinates and/or
      street address of radio tower, wireless access point, manually
      provisioned, or last known position fix, etc.

   L15.  Default identification: PSAPs MUST be made aware when imprecise
      location information was used to route a call.

      [Ed.  Changed from "default" to "imprecise", since the term
      default doesn't adequately represent a lower precision, yet
      contextually appropriate location.]

   L16.  Location Responsibility: Location determination MUST assume a
      responsible party.

      Motivation:  The emergency network in most cases today is accessed
      via the PSTN using either a wireline or a cellular device.  In
      both cases location information is provided by the Carrier and is
      used directly to route the call.  Since the Carrier must route the
      call to the emergency network, the emergency network holds the
      carrier responsible for the correct location determination and
      routing, and this forms the basis of requirement 1.  A certain
      level of authentication and validation around the source of the
      location is required for the domain in which the information is to
      be used.

   L17.  Time of Location: Location determination MUST be relevant to
      time of call.

      Motivation:  The location information MUST be attributed to a
      specific point in time.  That is, the location used for routing
      and which is reported to the PSAP call taker, must be the actual
      location of the caller at the time of making the call.  This
      provides call takers with confidence that the Emergency Caller is
      at the location.  This is accomplished today with existing
      telephony networks either through the use of a calling-number to



Schulzrinne & Marshall    Expires November 6, 2005             [Page 16]

      address "wire-map" database, or for cellular with more complex
      triangulation and GPS based techniques where the location is
      determined by the network and delivered at the time of the call.

   L18.  Location, Emergency Caller: Location provided with call MUST be
      associated with an Emergency Caller.

      Motivation:  The location information MUST be attributed to a
      specific emergency caller.  That is, for each call initiated, the
      emergency network requires that the location was determined for
      that specific caller and is not reused from a location
      determination applicable to a different Emergency Caller.  This
      information defines when the location was attributed to the
      Emergency Caller, thereby tying a valid location to a user at a
      specific point in time.

   L19.  Location Domain Availability: Location domain MUST be
      obtainable by Emergency Caller.

      Motivation:  Requirement 1 states that a level of authentication
      and validation for the source of the location is required.  This
      implies the need to for the Emergency Caller to determine the
      authenticating and validating entity for the emergency services
      domain in which they reside.  That is, it must be possible for an
      Emergency Caller to discover and utilize an answerable source of
      location in the access network they are using.

      [Ed.  Request clarification of supporting text.]

   L20.  Location Certification: Location provided MUST be certified.

      Motivation:  The Emergency Caller must be able to establish a
      session with the access domain authenticating and validating
      entity to obtain a certified location.  The authentication of the
      location is granted with an expiry time, after which the location
      within the domain is deemed invalid.

   L21.  Location and Emergency Caller Identity: It MUST NOT be assumed
      that Emergency Caller identity provided with location is true
      identity of Emergency Caller.

      Motivation:  The session between the Emergency Caller and the
      domain authenticating and validating entity SHALL NOT require the
      true identity of the Emergency Caller.  That is, the true identity
      of the user need never be revealed to the domain authenticating
      and validating entity, a random unique pseudonym generated within
      the authenticated domain is sufficient.

Internet-Draft             ECRIT requirements                   May 2005


   L22.  Location Acceptability: Location provided by Emergency Caller
      MUST be considered acceptable as input to authentication and
      validation entity.

      Motivation:  The domain authenticating and validation entity MUST
      be able to accept a location provided by an Emergency Caller.  On
      receipt of the Emergency Caller's location the domain
      authenticating and validation entity SHOULD validate the location
      as being applicable to that domain that is, it falls within
      reasonable geographic boundaries for that domain before returning
      the certified location to the Emergency Caller.

   L23.  Location Sources: It MUST NOT be assumed that location is
      always provided by Emergency Caller.

      Motivation:  The Emergency Caller may have no means of determining
      or providing a location, in which case the domain authentication
      and validation entity MAY provide an estimate of location.

   L24.  Location Query Authorization: The ability to query emergency
      caller location using a location key MUST be limited to authorized
      end points.

      Motivation:  Where the Emergency Caller does not desire the
      transmission of their location in-band with their call setup, they
      shall have the option of requesting a unique query key such that
      only authorized end points may query the location directly from
      the domain.

   L25.  Location Domain Authorization: Location Source entity MUST be
      authorized within the access domain.

      Motivation:  That the source of the location is considered to be
      authorized to provide the location within the access domain.

   L26.  Endpoint Location: Location MUST be tied to an endpoint within
      the access domain at the time of an emergency call.

      Motivation:  The location is tied to an end-point inside the
      access domain controlled by the source.  This binding between
      location and end-point is correct at the time of the call.

   L27.  Location Sources: Single source of location MUST NOT be
      assumed.

Internet-Draft             ECRIT requirements                   May 2005


      Motivation:  To achieve this, the end user device MUST be able to
      retrieve its current location from the access provider, from the
      infrastructure, via GPS, ... or as last resort, from the user
      itself.

   L28.  Location Provided: Endpoint location SHOULD be provided to ECC.

      Motivation:  Transmission of the current location of the
      contacting device to the ECC.

   L29.  Provide Endpoint Identification: Identification of endpoint or
      Emergency Caller SHOULD be provided to ECC, sufficient to allow
      the PSAP/ECC to re-initiate contact with the emergency caller
      after the initial call has ended (or cleared).

      Motivation:  Identification of the contacting person or device.

   L30.  Diverse Location Technologies: Emergency Services SHOULD
      support variety of current and future location determination
      technologies.

      Motivation:  Emergency call mechanisms should not require a
      specific technology for determining the location of the caller.

6.  Identifying  the Appropriate Emergency Call Center

   From the previous section, we take the requirement of a single (or
   small number of) emergency addresses which are independent of the
   caller's location.  However, since for reasons of robustness,
   jurisdiction and local knowledge, PSAPs only serve a limited
   geographic region, having the call reach the correct PSAP is crucial.
   While a PSAP may be able to transfer an errant call, any such
   transfer is likely to add tens of seconds to call setup latency and
   is prone to errors.  (In the United States, there are about 6,100
   PSAPs.)

   There appear to be two basic architectures for translating an
   emergency identifier into the correct IPSAP's emergency address.  We
   refer to these as caller-based and mediated.  In caller-based
   resolution, the caller's user agent consults a directory and
   determines the correct IPSAP based on its location.  We assume that
   the user agent can determine its own location, either by knowing it
   locally or asking some third party for it.  A UA could conceivably
   store a complete list of all PSAPs across the world, but that would
   require frequent synchronization with a master database as PSAPs
   merge or jurisdictional boundaries change.

   For mediated resolution, a call signaling server, such as a SIP
   (outbound) proxy or redirect server, performs this function.  Note
   that the latter case includes the architecture where the call is
   effectively routed to a copy of the database, rather than having some
   non-SIP protocol query the database.  Since servers may be used as
   outbound proxy servers by clients that are not in the same geographic
   area as the proxy server, any proxy server has to be able to
   translate any caller location to the appropriate PSAP.  (A traveler
   may, for example, accidentally or intentionally configure its home
   proxy server as its outbound proxy server, even while far away from
   home.)

   Note that the first proxy, the ESRP, doing the translation may not be
   in the same geographic area as the UA placing the emergency call.

   The resolution may take place well before the actual emergency call
   is placed, or at the time of the call.

   The problem is harder than for traditional web or email services.
   There, the originator knows which entity it wants to reach,
   identified by the email address or HTTP URL.  However, the emergency
   caller only dialed an emergency identifier.  Depending on the
   location, any of several ten thousand PSAPs around the world could be
   valid.  In addition, the caller probably does not care which specific
   PSAP answers the call, but rather that it be an accredited PSAP,



Schulzrinne & Marshall    Expires November 6, 2005             [Page 20]

Internet-Draft             ECRIT requirements                   May 2005


   e.g., one run by the local government authorities.  (Many PSAPs are
   run by private entities.  For example, universities and corporations
   with large campuses often have their own emergency response centers.)

   I1.  Correct PSAP: Calls MUST be routed to the correct PSAP based on
      the location of the caller and the declared service boundary of
      the PSAP.

      Motivation:  In particular, the location determination should not
      be fooled by the location of IP telephony gateways or dial-in
      lines into a corporate LAN (and dispatch emergency help to the
      gateway or campus, rather than the caller), multi-site LANs and
      similar arrangements.

   I2.  Early routing: In mediated mode, the first proxy server along a
      request path MUST attempt to route the call to the appropriate
      IPSAP.

      Motivation:  Proxy servers close to the caller can be expected to
      have better call routing knowledge, particularly if international
      boundaries are being crossed.

   I3.  Multi-stage: In multi-stage mode, intermmediate entities MAY be
      needed for call routing.

      The user agent or a call routing entity close to the caller may
      not be able to deliver the call directly to the serving PSAP, but
      rather to an intermediary that it turn uses caller location
      information to route the call closer to the appropriate PSAP.

   I4.  Choice of IPSAPs: The emergency caller SHOULD be provided a
      choice of emergency call centers if more than one exists and is
      relevant.

      Motivation:  This choice is often, but not always, provided today.
      The system should offer the emergency caller a choice as to
      whether he wants to reach a local private emergency response
      center, e.g., on a corporate campus, or the government-run
      emergency call center responsible for his current location.  For
      example, in some cases, the local campus emergency center is
      reachable by a different identifier, or 9-911 reaches the external
      PSAP, while 911 reaches campus security.

   I5.  Assuring IPSAP identity: The emergency caller SHOULD be able to
      determine conclusively that he has reached an accredited emergency
      call center.

Internet-Draft             ECRIT requirements                   May 2005


      Motivation:  This requirement is meant to address the threat that
      a rogue, possibly criminal, entity pretends to accept emergency
      calls.

   I6.  Warnings for unidentifiable IPSAP. Implementations SHOULD allow
      callers to proceed, with appropriate warnings or user
      confirmations, if the identity of the destination IPSAP cannot be
      verified.

      Motivation:  Verification can fail for any number of reasons, such
      as lack of a common certificate chain, especially when traveling,
      call forwarding, or the expiration of certificates.
      Accreditation, e.g., in the case of corporate or university
      campuses, may not exist.

   I7.  Traceable resolution: Particularly for mediated resolution, the
      caller SHOULD be able to definitively and securely determine who
      provided the emergency address resolution information.

   I8.  Robustness: The resolution mechanism MUST allow systems to be
      deployed that are robust in the face of partial network and
      directory server failures.

   I9.  Caching location: Caching of location MAY be used to mitigate
      temporary unavailability of directories or network connectivity.

      Motivation:  As long as the routing information used has an expiry
      date/time, and the PSAP is reachable by the caller, a temporary
      failure of the lookup and routing mechanism should not prevent
      completion of the emergency call.

   I10.  Incrementally deployable: An Internet-based emergency call
      system MUST be able to be deployed incrementally.  In the initial
      stages of deployment, an emergency call may not reach the optimal
      PSAP.  If allowed, emergency calls must only be routed to PSAPs
      that have agreed to accept non-optimally routed calls.

      [Ed.  Can this be merged with R6?]

   I11.  ECC Availability:  ECC communication MUST be continuously
      available.

      Motivation:  From any Internet-connected device it MUST be
      possible at any time to contact the ECC responsible for the
      current location with the most appropriate method for
      communication for the user and the device.

Internet-Draft             ECRIT requirements                   May 2005


   I12.  ECC Testability:  The solution MUST include mechanisms to test
      access and availability to the location-appropriate ECC (PSAP),
      without affecting or interfering with actual emergency call
      processing or causing an emergency response.

      Motivation: It is important that there be mechanisms to verify
      that contact can be made to the proper ECC, that includes whether
      or not the PSAP is available at all times.

   I13.  Cross-Jurisdiction Device Support:  Devices SHOULD support
      alternate emergency service systems between countries.

      Motivation:  Even as each country is likely to operate their
      emergency calling infrastructure differently, SIP devices should
      be able to reach emergency help and, if possible, be located in
      any country.

      [Ed. above text needs clarification]

   I14: Routing MUST be possible on either civic or geo location
      information.

   I15: It MUST be possible to route a call based on either a civic or a
      geo location without requiring conversion from one to the other.
      This requirement does not prohibit an implementation from
      converting and using the resulting conversion for routing.

   I16: It MUST be possible for a designated 9-1-1 authority to a PSAP
      to approve of any geocoding database(s) used to assist in
      determining call routing to that PSAP.  Mechanisms must be
      provided for the PSAP designated 9-1-1 authorities to test and
      certify a geocoding database as suitable for routing calls to the
      PSAP.  The PSAP may choose to NOT avail itself of such a
      mechanism.

   I17: It MUST be possible for the designated 9-1-1 authority to
      supply, maintain, or approve of databases used for civic routing.
      Mechanisms must be provided for a designated authority for a PSAP
      to test and certify a civic routing database as suitable for
      routing calls to that PSAP.

   I18: It MUST be possible for the PSAP itself (or a contractor it
      nominates on its behalf) to provide geocode and reverse geocode
      data and/or conversion services to be used for routing
      determination.  This implies definition of a standard interchange
      format for geocode data, and protocols to access it.

Internet-Draft             ECRIT requirements                   May 2005


   I19: The PSAP MUST have a mechanism to declare its serving boundaries
      (in civic and geographic formats) for routing purposes.

   I20: Boundaries for civic routing MUST be able to be specific to a
      street address range, a side of a street (even/odd street
      addresses), a building within a "campus", or any of the location
      fields available.

      [Ed.  Available from where?  Please clarify.

   I21: It MUST be possible to use various combined components of the
      location object for determination of routing.  Some areas may only
      require routing to a country level, others to a state/province,
      others to a county, or to a municipality, and so on.  No
      assumption should be made on the granularity of routing boundaries
      or about the combination of components used.

   I22: Boundaries mechanisms for geo routing MUST be able to be
      specific to a natural political boundary, a natural physical
      boundary (such as a river), or the boundaries listed in the
      previous requirement.

   I23: Any given geographic location SHOULD result in identification of
      a unique governmentally-authorized PSAP entity for that location?

   I24: Routing databases using 9-1-1 Valid Addresses or lat/lon/
      altitude as keys MUST both be available to all entities needing to
      route 9-1-1 calls.

   I25: Carriers, enterprises and other entities that route emergency
      calls MUST be able to route calls from any location to its
      appropriate PSAP.

   I26: It MUST be possible for a given PSAP to decide where its calls
      should be routed.

   I27: It is desirable for higher level civic authorities such as a
      county or state/province to be able to make common routing
      decisions for all PSAPs within their jurisdiction.  For example, a
      state may wish to have all emergency calls placed within that
      state directed to a specific URI.  This does NOT imply a single
      answering point; further routing may occur beyond the common URI.

   I28: Routing MAY change on short notice due to local conditions,
      traffic, failures, schedule, etc.

Internet-Draft             ECRIT requirements                   May 2005


   I29: Information and mechanisms used to determine routing MUST be
      extremely reliable and available, which implies redundancy,
      protocol stability, and resiliency.

   I30: Routing information MUST be secured against unauthorized
      modification.  PSAPs (or perhaps a higher level civic authority
      such as a county, state/province or national body) or their
      designated representative must be the only entities permitted to
      change routing information.

   I31: It MUST be possible to supply contingency routing information,
      for example, an alternate URI or an E.164 to be used when normal
      routing fails.

   I32: Multiple types of failures MAY have different contingency
      routes.

   I33: It MUST be possible to provide more than one contingency route
      for the same type of failure.

   I34: A procedure MUST be specified to handle "default route"
      capability when no location is available or the location
      information is corrupted.

   I35: Default routes MUST be available when location information is
      not available.

      [Ed.  Suggest consolidation of above 5 req's.]

   I36: Entities routing emergency calls SHALL retain information used
      to choose a route for subsequent error resolution.

   I37: Access Infrastructure providers MUST provide a location object
      that is as accurate as possible when location measurement or
      lookup mechanisms fail.

   I38: Location available at the time that the call is routed MAY not
      be accurate.

      Motivation:  Updates to location may result in a different route
      and the system must accommodate this.

   I39: It SHOULD be possible to have updates of location (which may
      occur when measuring devices provider early, but imprecise "first

7.  Emergency Address Directory

   D1.  ECC Identification:  Public access to ECC selection information
      MUST be assumed.

      Motivation:  The capability to locate the responsible ECC must be
      available in the public Infrastructure without the additional need
      for a service provider.

   D2.  Assuring directory identity: The query agent (e.g UA or server)
      MUST be able to assure that it is querying the intended directory.

   D3.  Query response integrity: The query agent MUST be able to be
      confident that the query or response has not been tampered with.

   D4.  Assurance of Update integrity: Any update mechanism for the
      directory MUST ensure that only authorized users can change
      directory information and must keep an audit log of all change
      transactions.

   D5.  Call setup latency: The directory lookup SHOULD minimize any
      added delay to the call setup.

      Motivation:  Since outbound proxies will likely be asked to
      resolve the same geographic coordinates repeatedly, a suitable
      time-limited caching mechanism should be supported.

   D6.  Multiple directories: A UA or proxy SHOULD be able to use
      multiple (separate) directories to resolve the emergency
      identifier.

      Motivation: A single directory with worldwide or even nationwide
      coverage is not assumed.  This allows competing or regional data
      sources.

   D7.  Referral: All directories SHOULD refer out-of-area queries to an
      appropriate default or region-specific directory.

      Motivation:  This requirement alleviates the potential for
      misconfigurations to cause calls to fail, particularly for caller-
      based queries.

   D8.  Multiple query protocols: Directories MAY support multiple query
      protocols.

      It may be useful if directories support multiple query protocols,
      such as SIP (for proxying), IRIS, LDAP, a SOAP-based query and
      others.  It appears likely that the resolution mechanism will be
      needed by a variety of session protocols and user applications.

   D9.  Baseline query protocol: A mandatory-to-implement protocol MUST
      be specified.

      Motivation:  An over-abundance of similarly-capable choices
      appears undesirable for interoperability.

8.  Identifying the Caller

   C1.  Identity: The system SHOULD allow (but not force) the
      identification of both the caller's identity and his or her
      terminal network address.

   C2.  Privacy override: The end system MUST be able to automatically
      detect that a call is an emergency call and override any privacy
      settings that conflict with emergency calling.

      Motivation:  Since emergency calls are often placed by children,
      by people using somebody else's end system or by people in panic,
      any configuration should be automated rather than relying on user
      interaction at the time of the call.  Delaying a call until the
      user discovers that they have to answer some screen prompt or deal
      with a voice prompt in an unfamiliar language is likely to lead to
      large call setup delays or call failures.  This does not preclude
      that end systems can allow, on a call-by-call basis, to configure
      special call parameters, e.g., to enable anonymous tip lines.
      Whether this override can be configured by the user or is
      considered a condition of service is considered a legal matter,
      not a protocol issue.

   C3.  Recontacting Endpoint:  The ECC SHOULD have the capability to
      recontact the initiating endpoint after disconnection.

      Motivation:  Capability to re-contact the contacting device from
      the ECC in case of disruption or later query for a tbd period of
      time.  This should also be possible from conventional ECC via
      temporary (virtual) E.164 numbers.

9.  Call Setup and Call Features

   S1.  Authentication override: All outbound proxies and other call
      filtering elements MUST be able to be configured so that they
      allow unauthenticated emergency calls.

      In many jurisdictions, emergency calls can be placed by any
      device, regardless of whether it has subscribed for service.

   S2.  Mid-call features: The end system MUST be able to recognize an
      emergency call and allow configuration so that certain call
      features are not triggered accidentally.

      Motivation:  For example, it may be inappropriate to transfer the
      PSAP or put it on hold.  An end system MAY make it more difficult
      to disconnect an on-going emergency call or accept other incoming
      calls while in an emergency call.  Call transfer initiated by the
      emergency caller is likely only to be a problem if a PSTN gateway
      or B2BUa is in the call path.  It is not clear how much effort
      should be expended on preventing intentional, as opposed to
      accidental, disconnection, since callers can typically find
      physical-layer means to terminate the call.  This feature is not
      generally available in the PSTN.  For example, ANSI T1.628-2001
      states that "E9-1-1 Call hold is an optional network feature
      provided to a PSAP which prevents a caller from disconnecting an
      ESC. ....  However, there is no DSS1 or SS7 support for this
      capability at this time."

   S3.  Testable: A user SHOULD be able to test whether a particular
      address reaches the appropriate PSAP, without actually causing
      emergency help to be dispatched or consuming PSAP call taker
      resources.  Such tests MUST indicate the source of any problems,
      including the validity and plausibility of civic addresses and
      geographic coordinates.  This requirement also allows address
      validation.

   S4.  Integrity: Implementations MUST provide mechanisms that ensure
      the integrity of IP protocol components that are crucial to
      providing reliable emergency call service.  (This requirement
      implies authentication of the caller to allow integrity protection
      of the request and authentication of the PSAP to allow integrity
      protection of responses.)

      [Ed. changed "SIP protocol component" to "IP protocol components".
      This requirement is not well understood based on comments
      received.  Further clarification requested.]

   S5.  Emergency Requests:  Requests for emergency services MUST NOT be
      assumed to be user initiated.

      Motivation:  Communication may be established by user request or
      by external events.  Devices should support alternate methods for
      initiating emergency requests without the user having to "dial" or
      type a specific address.

      [Ed.  Question has been raised as follows: "Should there be a
      requirement for a mechanism to distinguish calls not initiated by
      the user, as indicated in this requirement?"

   S6 Tracking and Tracing Facilities for all calls MUST be provided.
      This includes all routing entities as well as all signaling
      entities.

   S7 Each element in the signaling and routing paths solution SHALL
      maintain call detail records that can be accessed by management
      systems to develop call statistics in real time.

   S8 Each element of the signaling and routing paths SHALL provide
      congestion controls.

   S9 It SHALL be possible to determine the complete call chain of a
      call, including the identity of each signaling element in the
      path, and the reason it received the call (Call History).

10.  Supplemental Information

   SD1 In addition to information sent with the call, additional
      information may be available, supplemental to the call, which is
      retrieved from internal or external databases using a key to the
      information included with the call.  This key may also include
      information to identify/address the database.

   SD2 Additional information MAY be available to the call taker based
      on the location of the caller.

   SD3 Additional information MAY be available to the call taker based
      on the owner of the structure.

   SD4 Additional information MAY be available to the call taker based
      on the tenant of the structure.

   SD5 Where a vehicle is involved, additional information MAY be
      available.

   SD6 Additional information MAY be available based on the Address of
      Record (AoR) of the caller.  In this context, AoR equates to the
      caller.

   SD7 Consideration SHOULD be given to permitting users to have domain
      independent mechanisms to supply information related to the
      caller, for example, another datum related to user.

   SD8.  Additional Data:  Transfer of additional data SHOULD be
      supported.

      Motivation:  Capabilities to contact ECC by automatic means and
      for the transfer of additional information (alarm equipment, cars,
      buses, trucks with dangerous loads, ...)

   SD9 Mechanism MUST be provided to automatically generate and provide
      misroute and location error reports.

11.  Security Considerations

   Note: Security Considerations originally described in this section
   have removed and will be resubmitted to the ECRIT security document.
   No reference yet available.

   SEC1.  Safeguards from Attacks:  Safeguards SHOULD be provided to
      assure against network system attacks.

      Motivation:  Safeguards to protect the emergency infrastructure
      and ECC facilities against malicious attacks, especially to
      prevent DoS attacks.

   SEC2.  Denial of Service attacks:   Special consideration SHOULD be
      given to "Distributed Denial of Service" attacks.

   SEC3 Protocols MUST NOT facilitate denial-of-service attacks, e.g.,
      by amplifying incoming unauthenticated messages.

      [Ed. (per hgs, suggested replacement above first two requirements
      with third requirement.]
