Abstract

   This document defines a SIP extension header field used in
   conjunction with responses to REGISTER requests to provide a
   mechanism by which a registrar may inform a registering UA of a
   service route that the UA may use to request outbound services from
   the registrar's domain.

Internet-Draft    SIP Header Field for Service Route Discovery      February 2003


1. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [2].

2. Background

   3GPP established a requirement for discovering home proxies during
   SIP registration and published this requirement in [7].  The 3GPP
   network dynamically assigns a home service proxy to each
   address-of-record.  This assignment may occur in conjunction with a
   REGISTER operation, or out-of-band as needed to support call services
   when the address-of-record has no registrations.  This home service
   proxy may provide both inbound (UA terminated) and outbound (UA
   originated) services.

   In the inbound case, the request URI of incoming SIP requests matches
   the address-of-record (AOR) of a user associated with the home
   service proxy.  The home service proxy then (in most cases) forwards
   the request to the registered contact address for that AOR.  A
   mechanism for traversing required proxies between the home service
   proxy and the registered UA is presented in [5].

   Outbound (UA originated) session cases raise another issue.
   Specifically, "How does the UA know which service proxy to use and
   how to get there?"

   Several mechanisms were proposed in list discussions, including:

   1.  Configuration data in the UA.  This raises questions of UA
       configuration management and updating, especially if proxy
       assignment is very dynamic, such as in load-balancing scenarios.
   2.  Use of some other protocol, such as HTTP, to get configuration
       data from a configuration server in the home network.  While
       functional, this solution requires additional protocol engines,
       firewall complexity, operations overhead, and significant
       additional "over the air" traffic.
   3.  Use of lookup tables in the home network, as may be done for
       inbound requests in some 3G networks.  This has a relatively high
       overhead in terms of database operations.
   4.  Returning a 302 response indicating the service proxy as a new
       contact, causing the upstream node processing the 302 (ostensibly
       the UA) to retransmit the request toward the service proxy.
       While this shares the database operation of the previous
       alternative, it does explicitly allow for caching the 302
       response thereby potentially reducing the frequency and number of
       database operations.

   5.  Performing an operation equivalent to record-routing in a
       REGISTER transaction between the UA and the associated registrar,
       then storing that route in the UA and reusing it as a service
       route on future requests originating from the UA.  While
       efficient, this constrains the service route for proxy operations
       to be congruent with the route taken by the REGISTER message.
   6.  Returning service route information as the value of a header
       field in the REGISTER response.  While similar to the previous
       alternative, this approach grants the ability for the registrar
       to selectively apply knowledge about the topology of the home
       network in constructing the service route.

   This document defines this final alternative: returning the service
   route information as a header field in the REGISTER response.  This
   new header field indicates a "preloaded route" that the UA may wish
   to use if requesting services from the proxy network associated with
   the registrar generating the response.

   Scenario



       UA1----P1-----|    |--R-------|
                     |    |          |
                     P2---|         DBMS
                     |    |          |
       UA2-----------|    |--HSP-----|



                                Figure 1

   In this scenario, we have a "home network" containing routing proxy
   P2, registrar R, home service proxy HSP, and database DBMS used by
   both R and HSP.  P2 represents the "edge" of the home network from a
   SIP perspective, and might be called an "edge proxy".  UA1 is an
   external UA behind proxy P1.  UA1 discovers P1 via DHCP (this is just
   an example, and other mechanisms besides DHCP are possible).  UA2 is
   another UA on the Internet, and does not use a default outbound
   proxy.  We do not show DNS elements in this diagram, but will assume
   their reasonable availability in the discussion.  The mission is for
   UA1 to discover HSP so that outbound requests from UA1 may be routed
   (at the discretion of UA1) through HSP, thereby receiving outbound
   services from HSP.

3. Discussion of Mechanism

   UAs may include a Route header field in an initial request to force



Willis & Hoeneisen       Expires August 4, 2003                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft    SIP Header Field for Service Route Discovery      February 2003


   that request to visit (and potentially use services by) one or more
   proxies.  Using such a route (called a "service route" or "preloaded
   route") allows a UA to request services from a specific home proxy or
   network of proxies.  The open question is "how may a UA discover what
   service route to use?"

   This document defines a header field called "Service-Route" which can
   contain a route vector that, if used as discussed above, will direct
   requests through a specific sequence of proxies.  A registrar may use
   a Service-Route header field to inform a UA of a service route that,
   if used by the UA, will provide services from a proxy or set of
   proxies associated with that registrar.  The Service-Route header
   field may be included by a registrar in the response to a REGISTER
   request.  Consequently, a registering UA learns of a service route
   that may be used to request services from the system it just
   registered with.

   The routing established by the Service-Route mechanism applies only
   to requests originating in the user agent.  That is, it applies only
   to UA originated requests, and not to requests terminated by that UA.

   Simply put, the registrar generates a service route for the
   registering UA and returns it in the response to each successful
   REGISTER request.  This service route has the form of a Route header
   field that the registering UA may use to send requests through the
   service proxy selected by the registrar.  The UA would use this route
   by inserting it as a preloaded Route header field in requests
   originated by the UA intended for routing through the service proxy.

   The mechanism by which the registrar constructs the header field
   value is specific to the local implementation and outside the scope
   of this document.

4. Applicability Statement

   The Service-Route mechanism is applicable when:

   1.  The UA registers with a registrar.
   2.  The registrar has knowledge of a service proxy that should be
       used by the UA when requesting services from the domain of the
       registrar.  This knowledge may be a result of dynamic assignment
       or some other mechanism outside the scope of this document.
   3.  The registrar(s) has/have sufficient knowledge of the network
       topology, policy, and situation such that a reasonable service
       route can be constructed.
   4.  Other mechanisms for proposing a service route to the UA are not
       available or are inappropriate for use within the specific
       environment.

Internet-Draft    SIP Header Field for Service Route Discovery      February 2003


   Other methods may also be available by which a UA may be informed of
   a service route.  Such alternative methods are outside the scope of
   this document.  Discussion of why one might wish to assign a service
   route during registration or when it might be appropriate to do so is
   outside the scope of this document.

5. Syntax

   The syntax for the Service-Route header field is:

   Service-Route = "Service-Route" HCOLON sr-value *( COMMA sr-value)

   sr-value = name-addr *( SEMI rr-param )

   Note that the Service-Route header field values MUST conform to the
   syntax of a Route element as defined in [4].  As suggested therein,
   such values MUST include the loose-routing indicator parameter ";lr"
   for full compliance with [4].

   The allowable usage of header fields is described in Tables 2 and 3
   of [4].  The following additions to this table are needed for
   Service-Route.

6. Usage

6.1 Procedures at the UA

   The UA performs a registration as usual.  The REGISTER response may
   contain a Service-Route header field.  If so, the UA MAY store the
   value of the Service-Route header field in an association with the
   address-of-record for which the REGISTER transaction had registered a
   contact.  If the UA supports multiple addresses-of-record, it may be
   able to store multiple service routes, one per address-of-record.  If
   the UA refreshes the registration, the stored value of the
   Service-Route is updated according to the Service-Route header field
   of the latest 200 class response.  If there is no Service-Route



Willis & Hoeneisen       Expires August 4, 2003                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft    SIP Header Field for Service Route Discovery      February 2003


   header field in the response, the UA clears any service route for
   that address-of-record previously stored by the UA.  If the
   re-registration request is refused or if an existing registration
   expires and the UA chooses not to re-register, the UA SHOULD discard
   any stored service route for that address-of-record.

   The UA MAY choose to exercise a service route for future requests
   associated with a given address-of-record for which a service route
   is known.  If so, it uses the content of the Service-Route header
   field as a preloaded Route header field in outgoing initial requests
   [4].  The UA MUST preserve the order, in case there is more than one
   Service-Route header field or header field value.

   Loose routes may interact with routing policy in interesting ways.
   The specifics of how the service route set integrates with any
   locally required default route and local policy are implementation
   dependent.  For example, some devices will use locally-configured
   explicit loose routing to reach a next-hop proxy, and others will use
   a default outbound-proxy routing rule.  However, for the result to
   function, the combination MUST provide valid routing in the local
   environment.  In general, the service route set is appended to any
   locally configured route needed to egress the access proxy chain.
   Systems designers must match the service routing policy of their
   nodes with the basic SIP routing policy in order to get a workable
   system.

6.2 Procedures at the Proxy

   The Service-Route header field is generally treated like any other
   unknown header field by intermediate proxies.  They simply forward it
   on towards the destination.  Note that, as usual, intermediate
   proxies that need to be traversed by future requests within a dialog
   may record-route.  Proxies should not assume that they will be
   traversed by future requests in a dialog simply because they appear
   in the Service-Route header field.

   There is a question of whether proxies processing a REGISTER response
   may add themselves to the route set in the Service-Route header
   field.  While this would enable dynamic construction of service
   routes, it has two significant problems.  The first is one of
   transparency, as seen by the registrar: Intermediate proxies could
   add themselves without the knowledge or consent of the registrar.
   The second problem is interaction with end-to-end security.  If the
   registrar uses S/MIME techniques to protect the REGISTER response,
   such additions would be visible to the UA as "man in the middle"
   alterations in the response.  Consequently, intermediate proxies
   SHOULD NOT alter the value of Service-Route in REGISTER responses,
   and if they do, it MUST NOT be required that the UA accepts the

Internet-Draft    SIP Header Field for Service Route Discovery      February 2003


   alteration.

   Additional considerations apply if a proxy is "dual homed", meaning
   connected to two (or more) different networks such that requests are
   received on one interface and proxied out through another network
   interface.  Proxies implementing multi-homing precisely as documented
   in [4] record-route a request with the sending interface.  When
   processing the reply, they replace the Record-Route header field
   value that represents the interface onto which they proxied the
   request with a new value that represents the interface onto which
   they will proxy the response.  Consequently, the route vector seen at
   the UAS is not the exact inverse of the route vector seen at the UAC.
   While in itself harmless, this complicates matters for nodes that use
   the recorded route vector (or recorded Path vector as per [5]) in the
   determination of a service route for future use.

   Instead of following the procedure in [4], proxies used with
   Service-Route that are inserting Record-Route or Path header field
   values SHOULD record not one but two route values when processing the
   request.  The first value recorded indicates the receiving interface,
   and the second indicates the sending interface.  When processing the
   response, no modification of the recorded route is required.  This
   optimization provides for fully invertible routes that can be
   effectively used in construction of service routes.

6.3 Procedures at the Registrar

   When a registrar receives a successful REGISTER request, it MAY
   choose to return one or more Service-Route header field(s) in the 200
   class response.  The determination(s) of whether to include these
   header fields(s) into the 200 class response and what value(s) to
   insert are a matter of local policy and outside the scope of this
   document.

   Having inserted a Service-Route header field or fields, the registrar
   returns the 200 class response to the UA in accordance with standard
   procedures.

   A REGISTER operation performing a Fetching Bindings (i.e.  no Contact
   header field is present in the request) SHOULD return the same value
   of Service-Route as returned in the corresponding previous REGISTER
   response for the address-of-record in question.  In some cases, the
   Service-Route may be dynamically calculated by the registrar rather
   than stored, and the decision as to whether this route should be
   recalculated in the event of a Fetching Bindings operation is left to
   the implementation.

Internet-Draft    SIP Header Field for Service Route Discovery      February 2003


   Note: A Fetching Bindings operation could be used by the UA to
      recover a lost value of Service-Route.  Alternatively, a UA in
      this situation could just re-REGISTER.

   Certain network topologies MAY require a specific proxy (e.g.
   firewall proxy) to be traversed before the home service proxy.  Thus,
   a registrar with specific knowledge of the network topology MAY
   return more than one Service-Route header field or element in the 200
   class response; the order is specified as top-down, meaning the
   topmost Service-Route entry will be visited first.  Such
   constructions are implementation specific and outside the scope of
   this document.

   In general, the Service-Route header field contains references to
   elements strictly within the administrative domain of the registrar
   and home service proxy.  For example, consider a case where a user
   leaves the "home" network and roams into a "visited" network.  The
   registrar cannot be assumed to have knowledge of the topology of the
   visited network, so the Service-Route it returns contains elements
   only within the home network.

   Note that the inserted Service-Route element(s) MUST conform to the
   syntax of a Route element as defined in [4].  As suggested therein,
   such route elements MUST include the loose-routing indicator
   parameter ";lr" for full compliance with [4]

6.4 Examples of Usage

   We present an example in the context of the scenario presented in the
   Background section earlier in this document.  The network diagram is

6.4.1 Example of Mechanism in REGISTER Transaction

   This example shows the message sequence for user agent UA1
   registering to EXAMPLEHOME.COM using registrar R.  R returns a
   Service-Route indicating that UA1 may use home service proxy
   HSP.EXAMPLEHOME.COM to receive outbound services from
   EXAMPLEHOME.COM.

   Please note that some header fields (e.g.  Content-Length) and
   session descriptions are omitted to provide a shorter and hopefully
   more readable presentation.

6.4.2 Example of Mechanism in INVITE Transaction

   This example shows the message sequence for an INVITE transaction
   originating from UA1 eventually arriving at UA2 using outbound
   services from EXAMPLEHOME.COM.  UA1 has previously registered with
   EXAMPLEHOME.COM and been informed of a service route through
   HSP.EXAMPLEHOME.COM.  The service being provided by EXAMPLEHOME.COM
   is a "logging" service, which provides a record of the call for UA1's
   use (perhaps the user of UA1 is an attorney who bills for calls to
   customers).

   Note that in this example UA1 and UA2 are assumed to be registered
   with the same network (EXAMPLEHOME.COM).  This does not generally
   need to be the case to use the herein described service route
   mechanism.

   Message sequence for INVITE using Service-Route:

      HSP identifies the service to be executed from UA1's stored
      profile. The specifics of this are outside the scope of this
      document. For this example HSP writes a record to "Lawyer's log
      book", then looks up name "sip:UA2@EXAMPLEHOME.COM" and discovers that
      the current contact for UA2 is address 18.19.20.21.  This will be
      the request-URI of the next-hop INVITE.


   F5 INVITE HSP -> P2

      INVITE sip:UA2@18.19.20.21
      Via: SIP/2.0/USP HSP.EXAMPLEHOME.COM:5060;branch=z9hG4bKHSP10120323

      Record-Route: <sip:P1.EXAMPLEVISITED.COM;lr>
       . . .

      Note: P2 selected by outbound proxy rule on HSP.


   INVITE propagates toward UA2 as usual.

7. Security Considerations

   It is possible for proxies between the UA and the registrar during
   the REGISTER transaction to modify the value of Service-Route
   returned by the registrar, or to insert a Service-Route even when one
   was not returned by the registrar.  The consequence of such an attack
   is that future requests made by the UA using the service route might
   be diverted to or through a node other than would normally be
   visited.  It is also possible for proxies on the INVITE path to
   execute many different attacks.  It is therefore desirable to apply
   transitive mutual authentication using sips: or other available
   mechanisms in order to prevent such attacks.

   The "sips:" URI as defined in [4] defines a mechanism by which a UA



Willis & Hoeneisen       Expires August 4, 2003                [Page 14]

Internet-Draft    SIP Header Field for Service Route Discovery      February 2003


   may request transport-level message integrity and mutual
   authentication.  Since there is no requirement for proxies to modify
   messages, S/MIME signed bodies may be used to provide end-to-end
   protection for the returned value.

   Systems using Service-Route SHOULD provide hop-by-hop message
   integrity and mutual authentication.  UAs SHOULD request this support
   by using a "sips:" URI.  Registrars returning a Service-Route MUST
   implement end-to-end protection using S/MIME and SHOULD use S/MIME to
   protect all such responses.  UAs receiving Service-Route SHOULD
   authenticate attached S/MIME bodies if present.

8. IANA Considerations

   This document defines the SIP extension header field "Service-Route"
   which shall be included in the registry of SIP header fields defined
   in [4].  The change process for SIP, [6] mandates that general SIP
   extension header fields be defined by a standards-track RFC.  This
   document provides the required definition.

   The following is the registration for the Service-Route header field:

      RFC Number: RFCXXXX [Note to IANA: Fill in with the RFC number of
         this specification.]

      Header Field Name: Service-Route

      Compact Form: none
