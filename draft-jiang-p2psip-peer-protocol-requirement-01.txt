Internet-Draft                   P2PSIP                    February 2007


1.  Introduction

   P2P SIP uses P2P technology to build robust, distriubted location
   service for SIP entities.  Other than Client/Server(C/S) SIP servers,
   peers in P2PSIP are of different characteristics.  Peers are
   unstable, transient and unmanaged.  So the design of Peer protocol
   should consider these factors and come out with Peer protocol which
   could work well with so highly autonomous Peers.

   Availability and efficiency are often ignored in C/S SIP, because SIP
   servers are assumed to be powerful enough to process requests.  In
   order to improve availability and efficiency, backup mechanisms are
   often used in real implementations.  But in P2P SIP case, these two
   features must not be ignored, otherwise the P2P SIP system would not
   work or work poorly.  In this draft, we will compare C/S SIP and P2P
   SIP and come to a conclusion that two features must be realized in
   P2P SIP case.

   The draft is organized as follows.  In section 3, some background
   information is presented.  The comparison between C/S SIP and P2P SIP
   is discussed in section 4.  Section 5 states some problems inherent
   in P2P SIP case.  Basic requirements and some advanced requirements
   are proposed in Section 6.


2.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
   RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as
   described in RFC2119 .

   As for terminology about P2P SIP, we use the terminology defined in
   [2].


3.  Background of SIP and P2P

   SIP is a protocol to negotiate session parameters and establish the
   multimedia communication among participants of the session.
   Participants must locate other participants before they can establish
   communication.  Other than a few control functions, the main task of
   Proxy servers or Redirect servers is to look up correspondent's
   location in the location database which is populated by the messages
   sent from SIP User Agent to SIP Registrar.

   P2P technology has been widely used on the Internet in various
   applications, including file sharing and VoIP, etc.  The systems



Jiang                    Expires August 5, 2007                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                   P2PSIP                    February 2007


   built on P2P technology have some attractive features.  These systems
   could make full use of the resources in all participants so that it
   does not rely on central servers.  An analysis in [4] has proposed
   that a P2P protocol should be standardized in the IETF as a protocol
   used between a Registrar/Proxy/Redirect server and a Location
   Service.  After introducing P2P technology, SIP becomes a true P2P
   protocol and no longer needs Proxy/Redirect/Registrar for operation.

   Nodes participating in P2PSIP Overlay are classfied into two types:
   Peers and Clients.  Clients only put and get resource from the
   overlay which are made up of Peers.  Peers work collectively to
   maintain the overlay topology, route messages through the overlay and
   store data on behalf of overlay.  Peers also perform put and get
   operations like what Clients do.  In general, the functions of
   Clients are a logical subset of Peer's functions.

   P2PSIP Peer protocol is spoken between P2PSIP Overlay peers to share
   information and organize the P2PSIP Overlay Network.  The goal of
   P2PSIP WG is to standardize the application of existing P2P
   technology to provide robust, distributed location service.  Unlike
   servers in Client-Server architecture, Peers are unstable, transient,
   unmanaged.  So designing a Peer protocol that could work well with
   such highly autonomous Peers is a challenging task of P2PSIP WG.


4.  C/S SIP and P2P SIP

4.1.  Motivation from C/S SIP to P2P SIP

   Conventional SIP takes Client-server architecture and has a
   centralized location database to store the association between AOR
   and its possible contact locations.  The location database is
   maintained by Registrar which receives REGISTER messages from SIP
   UAs.  Proxy servers or Redirect servers can look up in the location
   database to get the callee's location.

   P2PSIP intends to provide the similar location service to SIP
   entities, including SIP UA, Proxy server, Redirect server.  The
   resulting distributed location service will be provided by all the
   Peers in the overlay.  P2P SIP has some advantages over C/S SIP:
   1.  No centralized servers: There is no necessary to deploy several
       central servers in the system in that Peers in the overlay could
       cooperate to get the user's location.
   2.  Ease of configuration.  C/S SIP system needs to do lots of work
       to configure central servers, but in P2PSIP case, central servers
       are not needed and new peer only need a bootstrap node to join
       the overlay.

   3.  Scalability. when a new Peer joins the overlay, it brings extra
       computing and storage resource into the overall system.

4.2.  Peers' characteristics in P2PSIP case

   P2PSIP Peers have different characteristics than C/S SIP servers.
   These characteristics will greatly influence the design of Peer
   protocol.

   o  Transient: Peers join the overlay if they want to communicate with
      other members of the overlay.  They may leave the overlay
      gracefully at any time for a variety of reasons .  So the time
      Peers stay in the overlay is transient because of their frequent
      join and leave operations.
   o  More frequent failure: a Peer often runs on a PC.  Its stability
      is much lower than that of a server.  It is easily subject to
      failure without notifying others in overlay.  If that happens,
      overlay topology is not correct, and must be repaired.
   o  Limited processing power: The computer which a Peer resides on may
      have limited processing power.  If one Peer receives more requests
      than it can queue and process during a given time period, it will
      delay at least some of the requests and even drop the excess.

4.3.  Comparison between C/S SIP and P2PSIP

   We will compare C/S SIP and P2PSIP in terms of location service in
   the following three perspectives:

   o  Information distribution: In C/S SIP, location information is
      stored on a centralized server for each SIP domain.  But the
      information is distributed among all Peers in the P2PSIP case.
   o  Availability: Availability is an important feature of practical
      systems.  Location service in C/S SIP is not available if the
      central server storing the key information does not work.  In
      order to avoid single point of failure, C/S SIP uses some backup
      servers to improve the availability.  In P2PSIP, every peer stores
      a small part of location information.  If some peers fail, the
      system only lost a few pieces of information which are stored on
      these peers, hence the system has not lost all availability.  The
      problem in P2PSIP is that in naive P2P implementations there is
      only one copy of each user's location information.  If Peers fail,
      the unique copy will be lost.  So the Peer protocol should be
      specified in a way that supports the availability of the
      distributed location service.
   o  Efficiency: In C/S SIP, the lookup operation is executed in a
      centralized server.  So, the efficiency could be ignored in this
      case.  But in P2PSIP, lookup operation will trigger messages
      routed through the overlay, hence introducing a significant

Internet-Draft                   P2PSIP                    February 2007


      latency.  Although all DHT algorithms ensure that the lookup
      operation succeeds within Log(N) steps, improving lookup
      efficiency makes sense.  The distributed location service is used
      to support interactive communications which have rigid
      requirements for call establishment time.  So the Peer protocol
      shoud be specified in a way that allows improved efficiency.


5.  Problem statement

   In this section, we will present some problems inherent in P2P
   overlay.  Some assumptions are made before discussing these problems:

   o  Bootstrap node is assumed to be known by a Peer before the Peer
      joins the overlay.  The method for Peers to get bootstrap node are
      static locations, cached peers, broadcast mechanism, etc.
   o  How to get credential of a Peer is not within the scope of Peer
      protocol, but the format of credential should be standardized in
      P2PSIP to improve security.

   Figure 1 Peers in the overlay

   In figure 1, Peer A, B, C and D construct a P2PSIP overlay.  Peer A
   is behind NAT.  The topology is like that the above figure shows.
   These four peers work together to provide a distributed location
   service.  Each of them stores information and routes requests in the
   overlay.  Basically, subsequent discussions are based on the figure.

5.2.  Problem 1: NAT traversal

   If Peer A wants to join the overlay, it should initiate join
   operation as common DHT algorithms do.  Assume that Peer D is the
   bootstrap node that Peer A knows.  If the message goes through the
   path like D->C->B->A, then A communicate with B through the NAT.  The

Internet-Draft                   P2PSIP                    February 2007


   method to traverse NAT is more difficult, if Peer B is also behind
   another NAT.  Peer protocol should make use of the methods which are
   proposed in BEHAVE and MMUSIC WG and provide any unique requirements
   because of P2P to these working groups.

5.3.  Problem 2: Lost Information

   Nearly all DHT algorithms could work well even if the Peers join and
   leave the overlay frequently.  But if a Peer fails suddenly, the
   disaster may happen for a naive implementation.  For example, at the
   beginning, the whole user location information is stored among all
   Peers.  All of a sudden, Peer B does not work and does not notify
   others in overlay.  It means that others in the overlay may not
   notice disappearance of Peer B and Peer B has not transferred the
   information stored on it to another peer somewhere in the overlay.
   As a result, the information stored on Peer B is lost.  So, Peer
   protocol must address this problem, otherwise P2PSIP will not work,
   or may work badly.

5.4.  Problem 3: Low routing efficiency

   One major function of Peers is to route messages through the overlay
   and find the responsible Peer for the message.  Unlike topology in
   Figure 1, real P2P systems often have at least thousands of nodes.
   In such a large system, latency arising from message routing through
   overlay should not be ignored.

   To improve the lookup efficiency, we could consider methods in two
   lines of attack.  One is to optimize routing efficiency and shorten
   the hops of the signalling path.  The other is to put the requested
   information as near to the requesting peer as possible.  The latter
   consideration may require that the users' location information should
   be cached in the overlay other than the original information.  The
   overlay will need some synchronization operations to keep the caches
   correct.  The former may require that Peers collect more topology
   information to speed up lookup operation.


6.  Requirements

   In this section, we will summarize the requirements for Peer
   protocol.  The basic requirements are DHT topology related and other
   requirements concern about availability, efficiency of the
   distributed location service.

Internet-Draft                   P2PSIP                    February 2007


6.1.  Basic requirements for Peer protocol

6.1.1.  Transport requirement

   Most of the P2PSIP peer protocol messages will be delivered through
   the overlay hop-by-hop, so any lost message in transit MAY fail the
   corresponding transaction, for example, GET operation MAY fail
   because of resource limit on any intermediate peer which discards the
   message.  On the other hand, operations in DHT algorithms often
   trigger a great number of messages.  For example, Chord-based peers
   periodically update their finger table.  This procedure will produce
   a large number of message exchanges.  So the ratio of net payload to
   message size should be kept as high as possible.

   So there are some transport requirments for peer protocol:

   1.  Peer protocol SHOULD deliver peer protcol messages reliably.  It
       could use the reliable transport service directly, such as TCP.
       If it would use datagram tranport service, the messages should be
       kept in a appropriate size so that it would not be fragmented in
       transit.
   2.  Peer protocol SHOULD be efficient enough to keep the ratio of net
       payload to message size as high as possible.

6.1.2.  API requirement

   P2PSIP overlay intends to provide distributed database service for
   upper layer applications.  For example, it provides distributed
   location service for SIP protocol which is used to established
   interactive communication.

   Peer protocol not only realizes the maintenance work of overlay
   topology, but also provides data service for upper layer applications
   to store and retrieve information in/from the overlay.  The work to
   maintain overlay topology is to keep routing states in every peer
   consistent with the topology as peers join or leave the overlay.

   So Peer protocol must provide a few primitive functions which are
   essential for most DHT algorithms.  These primitive functions
   include: join, leave, put, get, remove.  The above primitive
   functions could be thought of as building blocks of Peer protocol.
   As Peer protocol evolves, new primitive functions will be added in
   the future.

6.1.3.  Service requirement on peer's functionality

   Peers work together to provide service to upper layer applications,
   so they should serve each other to achieve this goal.  DHT algorithms

Internet-Draft                   P2PSIP                    February 2007


   require that each peer MUST provide routing service and storage
   service for other peers.  In order to make full use of processing
   power, including CPU cycles, bandwidth, distributed through the peers
   in the overlay, some special cases MAY impose new service
   requirements on peers.  For example, in order to traverse NAT between
   peers in the overlay, some peers are equipped with STUN service or
   TURN relay service.  New services MAY emerge in the future.

   1.  Peer protocol MUST provide routing service and storage service in
       the overlay.
   2.  In some special cases, some peers SHOULD be equipped with STUN
       service or TURN relay service.

6.1.4.  DHT requirement

   There are various DHT algorithms in use, including Chord, CAN,
   Pastry, Bamboo, etc.  P2PSIP peer protocol SHOULD make the peer
   protocol be extensible enough to accommodate differences between
   various DHT algorithms, including some new DHT algorithms that may
   appear in the future.

6.1.5.  NAT traversal requirement

   NATs MAY prevent communications between nodes, either peers or
   clients.  P2PSIP community has agreed roughly that STUN/TURN/ICE will
   be used with P2PSIP peer protocol to address NAT traversal issue.  So
   cooperation with STUN/TURN/ICE may impose new requirments on the peer
   protcol.

   Before connectivity checks in ICE, agents must exchange their
   candidate addresses in SDP messages.  When used in SIP, SIP servers
   play a rendezvous point to exchange related information.  Likely,
   there MUST be a mechanism for peers to exchange their candidate
   addresses, either in a rendezvous or distributed way, in P2PSIP case.

   Peers in the overlay will need STUN/TURN servers to help them
   traverse NAT.  Because of a large portion of peers being behind NAT,
   NAT traversal imposes heavy demands on the processing power of STUN/
   TURN servers.  In order to make full use of processing power
   distributed through the overlay, peers with public address and being
   equipped with STUN/TURN functionalities SHOULD take the
   responsibility to help peers behind NAT.  So peer protocol should
   provide a mechanism for peers behind NAT to find peers who could
   provide STUN/TURN service.

   So there are some requirements from NAT traversal issues:

Internet-Draft                   P2PSIP                    February 2007


   1.  Peer protocol MUST provide a mechanism for peers to exchange
       their candidate addresses, either in a rendezvous or distributed
       way.
   2.  Peer protocol SHOULD provide a mechanism for peers behind NAT to
       find peers who could provide STUN/TURN service.

6.2.  Availability

   Through the comparison between C/S SIP and P2PSIP, we come to a
   conclusion that availability must be addressed in Peer protocol.
   Various specific methods may be used.  After examining some existing
   works, such as PAST[7], CFS[6], we identified some methods for
   improving availability and present them in following text.

   o  Neighbor detection: Peer protocol maintains dynamic topology of
      overlay network and keeps adjusting topology as Peers join and
      leave overlay, whether gracefully or ungracefully.  If a Peer
      leaves the overlay ungracefully, the rest of overlay must adjust
      the topology.  The availability may be lost during the time.  So,
      Peers who have adjacent relationship should have some methods to
      detect if Peers are alive.
   o  Replication: In case of the unique copy's loss from failed Peers,
      a feasible method to improve availability is to replicate the
      unique copy and place several copies into the overlay.
      Replication function could be thought of as overlay function and
      information requestors are not aware of how the replication works.
      In [5], David has proposed another replication method in which
      information producers explicitly produce replicas and information
      requestor should try different replicas until one of them is
      found.

6.3.  Efficiency

   Because location service is used to support interactive communication
   applications, Peer protocol should be designed to have high lookup
   efficiency, even if the route table does not reflect the dynamic
   topology accurately due to Peer's churn.  In order to speed up lookup
   process, some enhancements have been specified in existing DHT
   systems, including PAST[7], CFS[6].  Caching is a commonly used
   method.  In future, other methods may be identified and proposed.
   o  Peer protocol should have a cache mechanism to shorten the hops
      traversed from requesting Peer to the destination and speed up
      lookup operation.


7.  Security requirements

   There have been a few contributions [9][10][11] which identify

   security issues in P2PSIP case and summarize security requirements
   for P2PSIP case.  So in this proposal, security requirements will not
   be discussed.  We hope our contributions could merge with these
   security requirements to present an integral requirement document for
   P2PSIP peer protocol.


8.  IANA Considerations

   This document presently raises no IANA considerations.
