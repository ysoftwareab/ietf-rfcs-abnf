Abstract

   This is a submission for the creation of an new IANA Time Zones
   registration process.  This is a registry for iCalendar "VTIMEZONE"
   calendar component information.  Time zones and their definitions are
   required in order to schedule and synchronize meetings and software.
   The condition in which these time zones change are subject to civil
   authority rulings and are not always determinable by software
   algorithms.

   This is intended to be a central repository for time zone
   information.  The registry does not presume to be the authority for
   time zone information or rules.  This register is simply a place
   where time zone definitions may be registered for public access.

Internet-Draft             Time Zone Registry               January 2005

1.  Introduction

   Many software vendors create time zone information for their
   applications.  This information can sometimes be inconsistent with
   other applications or contain insufficient information when referring
   to times far in the past.  By creating an IANA registry, the same
   information will be available to any vendor.  In addition there is
   revision control in the database so vendors will know if they have
   the latest data.

   Each time zone has a unique iCalendar time zone identifier (TZID).
   This document uses the iCalendar "LAST-MODIFIED" property in the
   iCalendar "VTIMEZONE" calendar component to track revisions of the
   data.

   The "VTIMEZONE" calendar component is not defined in this
   specification and all usage here are simply examples.  At the time of
   this writing RFC-2445 is the authority for the "VTIMEZONE" calendar
   component.  The initial information in the registry will be from the
   [TZ] database.

   When applications create information using a time zone is critical
   that the using applications have the same definitions of the time
   zone in order for the instances in time to match.  For that reason
   the "TZID" property value will contain the revision information of
   the time zone name and the "TZURL" value will point to the specific
   revision of the time zone data.

   The "TZID" property values are broken down into parts; region,
   optional sub-regons, city, and revision.  And they are separated
   using the slash (/) character.

   This example is using the factious America/BosieLike time zone that
   was registered on January 15th, 2005 at 6:17:22 PM UTC:

2.  Basic Grammar and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY" and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interoperated as described in
   [11].

   The notation used in this memo is the ABNF notation of [12].  Readers
   intending on implementing this format defined in this memo should be
   familiar with this notation in order to properly interpret the
   specifications of this memo.

   All numeric and hexadecimal values used in this memo are given in
   decimal notation.

   All names of properties, property parameters, enumerated property
   values and property parameter values are case-insensitive.  However,
   all other property values are case-sensitive, unless otherwise
   stated.
      Note: All indented editorial notes, such as this one, are intended
      to provide the reader with additional information.  The
      information is not essential to the building of an implementation
      conformant with this memo.  The information is provided to
      highlight a particular feature or characteristic of the memo.

   The format for the iCalendar object is based on the syntax of the
   [14] content type.  While the iCalendar object is not a profile of
   the [14] content type, it does reuse a number of the elements from
   the [14] specification.

2.1  Formatting Conventions

   The mechanisms defined in this memo are defined in prose.  Many of
   the terms used to describe these have common usage that is different
   than the standards usage of this memo.  In order to reference within
   this memo elements of the calendaring and scheduling model, core
   object [2] some formatting conventions have been used.  Calendaring
   and scheduling roles are referred to in quoted-strings of text with
   the first character of each word in upper case.  For example,
   "Organizer" refers to a role of a "Calendar User" within the protocol
   defined by [2].  Calendar components defined by this memo are
   referred to with capitalized, quoted-strings of text.  All calendar
   components start with the letter "V".  For example, "VTIMEZONE"
   refers to the time zone calendar component.

   The properties defined by this memo are referred to with capitalized,
   quoted-strings of text, followed by the word "property".  For
   example, "TZNAME" property refers to the iCalendar property used to

Internet-Draft             Time Zone Registry               January 2005

   convey the display name of the time zone.  Property parameters
   defined by this memo are referred to with lowercase, quoted-strings
   of text, followed by the word "parameter".  For example, "value"
   parameter refers to the iCalendar property parameter used to override
   the default data type for a property value.

2.2  Related Memos

   Implementers will need to be familiar with several other memos that,
   along with this memo.  Such as iCalendar [2] specifications.

   [2] - Specifies the format for the "VTIMEZONE" calendar component.

   This memo does not attempt to repeat the specification of concepts or
   definitions from these other memos.  Where possible, references are
   made to the memo that provides for the specification of these
   concepts or definitions.

2.3  International Considerations

   In the rest of this document, descriptions of characters are of the
   form "character name (codepoint)", where "codepoint" is from the US-
   ASCII character set.  The "character name" is the authoritative
   description; (codepoint) is a reference to that character in US-ASCII
   or US-ASCII compatible sets (for example the ISO-8859-x family,
   UTF-8, ISO-2022-xx, KOI8-R).  If a non-US-ASCII compatible character
   set is used, appropriate code-point from that character set MUST be
   chosen instead.  Use of non-US-ASCII-compatible character sets is NOT
   recommended.

3.  Security Considerations

   There are no known security issues with this proposal as this is a
   repository of information and not an over the wire protocol.

4.  Interoperability Considerations

   This document is intended to be compliant with the [iCAL] "VTIMEZONE"
   calendar component and will interoperate with any implementation that
   follows that specification.

Internet-Draft             Time Zone Registry               January 2005

5.  Registry TZID Value

   Within the time zone registry, the "TZID" property will be used as
   follows.  This is compatible with the [iCAL] "TZID" property as here
   we only define the format of the value of the property.

   Property Name: TZID

   Purpose: This property specifies the text value that uniquely
   identifies the "VTIMEZONE" calendar component in the IANA registry.
   The value is case sensitive and is UTF-8 so it should be able to
   accomidate any locale.

   Value Type: TEXT (in the format specified below)

   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
   specified on this property.

   Conformance: This property MUST be specified in a "VTIMEZONE"
   calendar component.

   Description: This is the label by which a time zone calendar
   component is referenced by any iCalendar properties whose data type
   is either DATE-TIME, DATE, or TIME and not intended to specify a UTC
   or a "floating" time.  The presence of the SOLIDUS character
   (US-ASCII decimal 47) as a prefix, indicates that this TZID
   represents an unique ID in a globally defined IANA time zone registry
   (this specification).  Conforming applications MUST supply the
   'tzrev' attribute shown below in the "TZID" property value.  The
   "TZID" property value points to a specific version of the time zone.

   All of the 'tzregion', 'tzcity', and 'tzrev' values are case
   sensitive.

   Format Definition: This property is defined by the following
   notation:

        tzid               = "TZID" tzidpropparam ":"
                              ianatzidprefix
                          "/" tzregion *( "/" tzregion )
                          "/" tzcity
                          "/" tzrev CRLF

        tzidpropparam      = *(";" xparam)

        ianatzidprefix     = "/IANA.ORG"

        tzregion           = < region names as used in the [TZ] databaee >
                           ; Examples are "Africa", "America", "Asia"
                           ;  "Europe", "Indian" "Pacific"

        tzcity             = <the name of a city in the tzregion>

        tzrev              = date-time "Z"

        date-time          = <as defined in iCalendar>

   Example: The following are examples of globally unique time zone
   identifiers as defined by this specification:

        TZID:/IANA.ORG/Indian/Reunion/20050115T112522Z

        TZID:/IANA.ORG/Pacific/Pago_Pago/20050114T162291Z

        TZID:/IANA.ORG//America/Indiana/Knox/20050114T162291Z

Internet-Draft             Time Zone Registry               January 2005

6.  Registry NAME

   One time zone definition may have more than one name or alias.  And
   time zone names might be in a non US-ASCII locale.  So this "NAME"
   property will be allowed multiple time in a "VTIMEZONE" component.
   By using the iCalenar "LANG" parameter, a "TZID" value can be
   represented as aliases in muliple locales.

   Property Name: NAME

   Purpose: The NAME property allows for a TZID to have many possibly
   locale specific names or aliases.

   Value Type: TEXT

   Property Parameters: The "LANG" parameter and non-standard property
   parameters can be specified on this property.

   Conformance: This property can be specified in a "VTIMEZONE" calendar
   component.

   Description: Multiple NAME properties may be in a "VTIMEZONE"
   calendar compoennt, each must be unique.  Each "NAME" property MUST
   include a "LANGUAGE" parameter specifing the locale where the "NAME"
   property value would be used.  There may be multiple "NAME"
   properties with the same "LANGUAGE" parameter value as long as those
   "NAME" property values are unique.  When in a "VTIMEZONE" calendar
   component then they are alias nams for the "TZID" property value.
   Note that the "STANDARD" and "DAYLIGHT" calendar components use zero
   or more of the locale specific "TZNAME" property as aliases as
   defined in iCalendar.

   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

        aliasname      = "NAME" nameparam ":" localeName CRLF

        nameparam = langparam *(";" xparam)

        langparam = < As defined in iCalendar >

        localName = < Single line text used as name or alias of TZID >a

   Examples.

Internet-Draft             Time Zone Registry               January 2005

7.  Registry TZURL Value

   Within the time zone registry, the "TZURL" property will be used as
   follows.  This is compatible with the [iCAL] "TZURL" property as here
   we only define the format of the value of the property.

   Property Name: TZURL

   Purpose: The TZURL provides a means for a VTIMEZONE component to
   point to a network location that can be used to retrieve an up-to-
   date version of itself.

   Value Type: URI

   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
   specified on this property.

   Conformance: This property can be specified in a "VTIMEZONE" calendar
   component.

   Description: The TZURL provides a means for a VTIMEZONE component to
   point to a network location that can be used to retrieve an up-to-
   date version of itself.  This provides a hook to handle changes
   government bodies impose upon time zone definitions.  Retrieval of
   this resource results in an iCalendar object containing a single
   VTIMEZONE component and a METHOD property set to PUBLISH.  Conforming
   applications MUST NOT supply the 'tzrev' attribute shown in the
   "TZID" property value above.  The "TZURL" property value points to
   the newest version of the time zone named in the "TZID" parameter.

   All of the fetch value is case sensitive.

   All of the 'tzregion' and 'tzcity' values are case sensitive.  And
   the '.ics' is in lower case.

   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

        tzurl      = "TZURL" tzurlparam ":" ianatzuri CRLF

        tzurlparam = *(";" xparam)

        ianatzuri  = "ftp://iana.org/XXXXXX"
                     "/" tzregion *( "/" tzregion )
                     "/" tzcity ".ics"

Internet-Draft             Time Zone Registry               January 2005

   Example: The following is an example of this property that points to
   the newest version of the time zone definitions.

     TZURL:ftp://iana.org/XXXXXX/Indian/Reunion.ics

     TZURL:ftp://iana.org/XXXXXX/Pacific/Pago_Pago.ics

     TZURL:ftp://iana.org/XXXXXX/America/Indiana/Knox.ics

8.  Fetching a specific version of a VTIMEZONE

   An application that wishes to get a specific version of a registered
   "VTIMEZONE" component creates the FTP url as follows:

   All of the 'tzregion', 'tzcity', and 'tzrev' values are case
   sensitive and '.ics' is lower case.

        fetchuri  = "ftp://iana.org/XXXXXX"
                    "/" tzregion *( "/" tzregion )
                    "/" tzcity
                    "/" tzrev ".ics"

   For example the following are the URIs to get a specific version of
   these time zones.

     ftp://iana.org/XXXXXX/Pacific/Pago_Pago/20050114T162291Z.ics

     ftp://iana.org/XXXXXX/Indian/Reunion/20050115T112522Z.ics

9.  Fetching the newest version of a VTIMEZONE

   An application that wishes to get the newest version of a registered
   "VTIMEZONE" component creates the FTP url as follows:

   Both the 'tzregion' and 'tzcity' values are case sensitive and '.ics'
   is lower case.

        fetchnewuri  = "ftp://iana.org/XXXXXX"
                       "/" tzregion *( "/" tzregion )
                       "/" tzcity ".ics"

   For example the following are the URIs to get a specific version of
   these time zones.

     ftp://iana.org/XXXXXX/Pacific/Pago_Pago.ics

     ftp://iana.org/XXXXXX/Indian/Reunion.ics

10.  iCalendar VTIMEZONE registry

   Each time zone is an [iCAL] "VTIMEZONE" calendar component.  The
   [iCAL] "TZID" property value will be unique in the IANA registry and
   will be prefixed with "/IANA.ORG/" to identify them as being part of
   the register.

   The TZURL property will be URL that will point to the newest version
   of the time zone ".ics" file in the IANA registry.

11.  AREA parameter

   The "POLYGON" property is being proposed to allow optional
   information about the area to included or excluded from a geographic
   area.

   This parameter specifies if the values of the "POLYGON" property are
   to be included or excluded from the geographic region described in
   the "VTIMEZONE" component.

   Parameter Name: AREA

   Purpose: To specify if the area is to be included or excluded from
   the geographic region.

   Value Type: TEXT

   Conformance: This property MUST BE specified in a "POLYGON" property.

   Description: If the AREA value is 'include', then the area is to be
   added to the geographic region of area covered.  If the value is
   'exclude', then the area is to be deleted from the geographic area
   covered.

   Format Definition: This property is defined by the following
   notation:

        area       = ";" "AREA" "=" ( "INCLUDE" / "EXCLUDE")

   Example: The following are examples of the usage of the "AREA"
   parameter:

        POLYGON;AREA=INCLUDE: ...lat/long..sets..of..data

12.  Specifying geographic area covered - POLYGON

   One of the issues brought up a few years ago on the CALSCH mailing
   list was how to identify the area covered by a time zone.  The issues
   are that two or more time zone may overlap, and they might have areas
   within them that are excluded, they have holes in their polygon.

   So the "POLYGON" property is being proposed to allow optional
   information about the area to include or exclude from a geographic
   area.

   Property Name: POLYGON

   Purpose: This property specifies the geographic area covered by a
   time zone.

   Value Type: TEXT (Comma separated latitude/longitude values)

   Property Parameters: The "AREA" parameter is the only parameter
   allowed.

   Conformance: This property MAY be specified in a "VTIMEZONE" calendar
   component.

   Description: The values are a comma separated set of longitude and
   latitude values to six decimal places.  There must be at least three
   sets and will be as many as needed to specify the area covered by the
   polygon.  Using the required "AREA" parameter an area can be included
   or exclude from the time zone area covered.  A time zone may have one
   or more non-overlapping areas.  And a time zone might have holes in
   it.

   The value type is TEXT and can be overwriten to be a "URI" value
   type, so that the definiton can point to a separate file that
   describes the geographic region that is convered.  The URI MUST point
   to a file that only contains a list of at least three comma separated
   'geopoint' entries as shown in this section.  And the URI MUST point
   to a publicly available file.

   The values start at one geographic point and continue in a counter
   clockwise direction.  The first point MUST NOT be repeated as the
   last point.  If drawn on paper, a line would start at the first
   point, continue to the second point, and to each next point.  Then a
   line would be drawn from the last point to the first point.

   Format Definition: This property is defined by the following
   notation:

        polygon     = "POLYGON" polytzparam ":"
                      geopoint "," geopoint "," geopoint *("," geopoint) CRLF

        polytzparam =  area  *( ";" "VALUE" "=" "URI" )

        geopoint    = lat "," lon

        lat         = <latitude with six digits to right of the decimal>

        lon         = <longitude with six digits to the right of the decimal>

   Example: The following is an example of a geographic region included,
   and a section excludes on the second entry (if done correctly, the
   time zone area in this example would be like a donut with a hole in
   the center).

        POLYGON;AREA=INCLUDE:43.336600,116.13.370000,
         40.475000,111.586700,
         37.276702,122.069020,
         33.260654,122.006900

        POLYGON;AREA=EXCLUDE:43.00,116.13.000000,
         40.30000,111.500000,
         37.20000,122.069000,
         33.20000,122.006000

   Now assume you have two text files with at least three comma
   separated 'geopoint' entries:

       http://iana.org/xxx/America/New_Yrk.geo

   and

       http://iana.org/xxx/America/Indiana/Knox.geo

   By using a "URI" value type, these can be in the "VTIMEZONE"
   component and point to a files that really contain the time zone
   geographic region.  So the "Americla/New_York.ics" file might contain
   this if the "America/New_York" time zone is not valid in the
   "America/Indiana/Knox" time zone.

13.  Initial Time Zone Names

   The following time zone ID's will are in the initial submission.
   They are all from the [TZ] database.  They will all have "TZID"
   property that matches the [TZ] database names and the 'tzrev' value
   that is the submission date to IANA.  (SAMPLE FOR NOW, FULL SET WILL
   BE ADDED IN LATER DRAFTS)
