1.  Introduction

   This document describes a URI resolution method for AREG [4] (Address
   Registry) type in the IRIS [2] namespace.  URI resolution is the
   process of determining which directory server to query for a given
   resource.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",

3.  URI Resolution for AREG

3.1  Application Service Label

   The application service label associated with AREG registry type MUST
   be "AREG1".  This is the abbreviated form the URN for this registry
   type, urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:areg1.

3.2  Top-Down Resolution

   The top-down alternative resolution method MUST be identified as
   'top' in IRIS URI's.

   The client SHOULD start every query from the IRIS server iris.nro.net
   and follow the referrals to find the authoritative server to actually
   query.
