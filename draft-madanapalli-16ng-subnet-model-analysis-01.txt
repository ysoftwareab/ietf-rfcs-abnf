Internet-Draft         IPv6 Link Models for 802.16        September 2006


1.  Introduction

   802.16 [1] [2] is a connection oriented access technology for the
   last mile without bi-directional native multicast support. 802.16 has
   only downlink multicast support and there is no mechanisms defined
   for MSs to be able to send multicast packets that can be mapped to
   downlink multicast connection.  This could be a problem for IP
   protocols (e.g.  ARP, IPv6 ND) that traditionally assume the
   availability of multicast at the link layer.  This is further
   complicated by the definition of commercial network models like
   WiMAX, which defines the Service Flows that extends the 802.16b MAC
   transport connection all the way to an Access Router by using a
   tunnel between BS and AR.  This leads to multiple ways of deploying
   IP over 802.16 based networks.

   This document looks at various considerations in selecting a link
   model for 802.16 based networks and provides analysis of the various
   possible link models.


2.  Terminology

   Access Router: An entity, which performs IP routing function to
   provide IP connectivity for MSs.  In WiMAX Networks, the AR is an ASN
   Gateway.

   Base Station (BS): A generalized equipment sets providing
   connectivity, management, and control of the subscriber station (SS).

   Dormant Mode: A state in which a mobile station restricts its ability
   to receive normal IP traffic by reducing monitoring of radio
   channels.  This allows the mobile station to save power and reduces
   signaling load on the network.  In the dormant mode, the MS is only
   listening at scheduled intervals to the paging channel.  The network
   maintains state about an MS which has transitioned to dormant mode
   and can page it when needed.

   IP Link: This has been defined in [3] as below.
      - a communication facility or medium over which nodes can
      communicate at the link layer, i.e., the layer immediately below
      IP.  Examples are Ethernets (simple or bridged), PPP links, X.25,
      Frame Relay, or ATM networks as well as Internet (or higher) layer
      "tunnels", such as tunnels over IPv4 or IPv6 itself.

   Mobile Station: An end-user equipment that provides connectivity to
   802.16 based networks.

   Point-to-multipoint: A link consists of a single interface

   communicating directly with more than one interface.


3.  IPv6 Link Models for 802.16 based Networks

   This section provides various IPv6 link models for 802.16 based
   networks and provides their operational considerations in practical
   deployment scenarios.

3.1.  Shared IPv6 Prefix Link Model

   The following figures illustrates high level view of the link model
   using shared prefix for IPv6 link wherein one more prefixes
   advertised on the link would be used by the all nodes attached to the
   IPv6 link.

        | MSn |-----+
        +-----+


               Figure 1. Shared IPv6 Prefix Link Model



   The above figure shows the case where BS and AR exist as separate
   entities, in this case a tunnelled interface exists between the BS
   and AR per MS basis.

   In this link model, the link between the MS and the AR at the IPv6
   layer is viewed as a shared link and the lower layer link between the
   MS and BS is a point-to-point link.  This point-to-point link between
   the MS and BS is extended all the way to the AR when the granularity
   of the tunnel between the BS and AR is on per MS basis.  This is
   illustrated in the following figure below.

         Figure 2. Shared IPv6 Prefix Link Model - Layered View



   In this link model, an AR can serve one or more BSs.  All MSs
   connected to BSs that are served by an AR are on the same IPv6 link.
   This model is different from Ethernet Like Link model wherein the
   later model provides Ethernet link abstraction and multicast
   capability to IPv6 layer.

3.1.1.  Prefix Assignment

   One or more IPv6 prefixes are assigned to the link and hence shared
   by all the nodes that are attached to the link.  The prefixes are
   advertised with autonomous flag (A-Flag) set and the On-link flag
   (L-flag) reset for address autoconfiguration so that the nodes may
   not make an on-link assumption for the addresses in those prefixes.

3.1.2.  Address Autoconfiguration

   There is no change to normal IPv6 address autoconfiguration
   mechanisms, which are specified in [4] [6].

3.1.3.  Duplicate Address Detection

   The DAD procedure as specified in [4] does not adapt well to the
   802.16 air interface as there is no native multicast support and when
   supported consumes air bandwidth as well as it would have adverse
   effect on MSs that were in the dormant mode.  An optimization, called
   Relay DAD, may be required to perform DAD.  In Relay DAD the MS
   behavior is same as specified in [4] and the optimization is achieved
   with the network support.  For this, the AR should maintain the list



Madanapalli              Expires March 30, 2007                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft         IPv6 Link Models for 802.16        September 2006


   of addresses, called Address Cache, that are currently in use within
   the IP link.  The relay DAD works as below:
   1.  An MS constructs a Link Local Address as specified in [4].
   2.  The MS constructs a solicited node multicast address for the
       corresponding Link Local Address and sends MLD Join request for
       the solicited node multicast address.
   3.  The MS starts verifying address uniqueness by sending a DAD NS on
       the initial MAC transport connection.
   4.  The AR looks into the address cache to check if the address is
       already in use.
   5.  The AR relays the DAD NS to the address owner in case there is a
       match in the address cache.  The address owner defends the
       address by sending DAD NA, which is relayed to the DAD
       originating MS via the AR.
   6.  Upon on receiving the DAD NA, the MS discards the tentative
       address and behaves as specified in [4].

3.1.4.  Considerations

3.1.4.1.  Reuse of existing standards

   The shared IPv6 prefix model uses the existing specification and does
   not require any protocol changes or any new protocols.  However this
   model requires implementation changes for DAD optimization on the AR.

3.1.4.2.  On-link Multicast Support

   No native on-link multicast is possible with this method.  However
   the AR can implement proxy mechanism for the on-link multicast if
   required on case-to-case basis.

3.1.4.3.  Consistency in IP Link Definition

   The definition of IPv6 link is consistent for all procedures and
   functionalities except for the support of native on-link multicast
   support.  However this can be supported with AR proxying for the
   multicast packets, which may increase the complexity of the AR
   implementation.

3.1.4.4.  Packet Forwarding

   This model requires that all MSs send the packets to the AR
   irrespective of the destination and scope of the IPv6 address.  The
   AR handles the packets with external IPv6 addresses normally.
   However the packets with link local destination addresses are relayed
   by the AR to destination without decrementing the hop-limit.

Internet-Draft         IPv6 Link Models for 802.16        September 2006


3.1.4.5.  Changes on Host Implementation

   This link model does not require any implementation changes on the
   host side.  However the hosts are required to perform duplicate
   address detection for all addresses even if the host is reusing the
   interface identifier.

3.1.4.6.  Changes on Router Implementation

   This link model requires implementation changes on the AR for
   supporting Relay DAD.  Relay DAD requires the maintenance of an
   Address Cache containing a list of addresses that are in use on a
   particular link.  The address cache may not be complete all the time
   due to loss of DAD probes or hosts not performing DAD when reusing
   the IID.  There can also be possible DoS attack from the hosts by
   configuring more number of addresses to overflow the address cache
   which requires the operator to limit the number of IPv6 address a
   host can have at any given instance.

3.1.5.  Applicability

   This model is applicable to service provider public access networks
   like cellular networks in conjunction with IPv6 CS.  This model can
   also be used in scenarios where the support for on-link multicast is
   required for service discovery; in this scenario the AR is expected
   to implement proxy support for multicast packets.

   This link model is also under consideration of the WiMAX Forum
   Network Working Group for using with IPv6 CS access.

3.2.  Point-to-point Link Model

   In WiMAX, there exists a point-to-point connection between an MS and
   the AR, which acts as the first hop router, bridged through a BS,
   over which packets are transferred.  In this model, a set of
   connections between an MS and the AR are treated as a single link.
   The point-to-point link model follows the recommendations of [8].  In
   this model, each link between the MS and the AR is allocated a
   separate, unique prefix or a set of unique prefixes by the AR.  No
   other node under the AR has the same prefixes on the link between it
   and the AR.  The following diagram illustrates this model.

               Figure 3. Point-to-point Link Model




   There are multiple possible ways that the point-to-point link between
   the AR and the MS can be implemented.
   1.  One way to accomplish this is to run PPP on the link [8].
       Running PPP requires that the 802.16 link use the Ethernet CS and
       PPP over Ethernet [10].  Since the IPv6 CS does not support PP,
       whether PPP can be run depends on the network architecture.
   2.  If the actual physical medium is shared, like Ethernet, but PPP
       is not run, the link can be made point to point between the MS
       and AR by having each MS on a separate VLAN [12].
   3.  If neither PPP nor VLAN is used, the set of 802.16 connections
       can be viewed as a virtual point-to-point link for the purpose of
       neighbor discovery and address configuration.  For IPv6 CS, this
       may be used to implement the point-to-point link.

3.2.1.  Prefix Assignment

   Prefixes are assigned to the link using the standard [3] Router
   Advertisement mechanism.  The AR assigns a unique prefix or set of
   unique prefixes for each MS.  In the prefix information options, both
   the A-flag and L-flag are set to 1, as they can be used for address
   autoconfiguration and the prefixes are on link.

3.2.2.  Address Autoconfiguration

   MSs perform link local as well as global address autoconfiguration
   exactly as specified in [4], including duplicate address detection.
   Because there is only one other node on the link, the AR, there is
   only a possibility of an address conflict with the AR, so collisions
   are statistically very unlikely, and easy to fix if they should

Internet-Draft         IPv6 Link Models for 802.16        September 2006


   occur.

   If DHCP is used for address configuration ('M=1' in the Router
   Advertisement), the DHCP server must provide addresses with a
   separate prefix per MS.  The prefix must of course match whatever
   prefix the ASN Gateway has advertised to the MS (if any).

3.2.3.  Considerations

3.2.3.1.  Reuse of existing standards

   This solution reuses RFC 2461, 2462, and if PPP is used, RFC 2472 and
   RFC 2516.  No changes in these protocols are required, the protocols
   must only be configured properly.

   If PPP is not used, any VLAN solution, such as IEEE 802.1Q [9], or
   any L2 tunnel can be used.

3.2.3.2.  On-link Multicast Support

   Since the link between the MS and the AR is point to point, any
   multicast can only be sent by one or the other node.  Link local
   multicast between other nodes and the AR will not be seen.

3.2.3.3.  Consistency in IP Link Definition

   The IP link is fully consistent with a standard IP point-to-point
   link, without exception.

3.2.3.4.  Packet Forwarding

   The MS always sends all packets to the AR, because it is the only
   other node on the link.  Link local unicast and multicast packets are
   also forwarded only between the two.

   When the p2p link model is used, the BS acts as a bridge.  For each
   MS, the BS bridges the unique prefix or set of prefixes assigned by
   the AR to the link between itself and the MS.  This means, in
   particular, that the per MS prefix or set of prefixes are routed on
   both sides (wireless and wired) of the BS, and that the BS needs to
   participate in all 802 standard bridging protocols.

3.2.3.5.  Changes on Host Implementation

   Host implementations follow standard IPv6 stack procedures.  No
   changes needed.

Internet-Draft         IPv6 Link Models for 802.16        September 2006


3.2.3.6.  Changes on Router Implementation

   If PPP is used, no changes in router implementations are needed.  If
   PPP is not used, the AR must be capable of doing the following:
   1.  Each MS is assigned a separate VLAN when 802.1X [13] or each MS
       must have an L2 tunnel to the AR to aggregate all the connections
       to the MS and present these set of connections as an interface to
       the IPv6 layer.
   2.  The AR must be configured to include a unique prefix or set of
       prefixes for each MS.  This unique prefix or set of prefixes must
       be included in Router Advertisements every time they are sent,
       and if DHCP is used, the addresses leased to the MS must include
       only the uniquely advertised prefixes.

   Note that, depending on the router implementation, these functions
   may or may not be possible with simple configuration.  No protocol
   changes are required, however.

3.2.4.  Applicability

   In enterprise networks, shared services including printers, fax
   machines, and other such on-line services are often available in on
   the local link.  These services are typically discovered using some
   kind of link local service discovery protocol.  The unique prefix per
   MS model is not appropriate for these kinds of deployments, since it
   is not possible to have shared link services in the ASN.

   The p2p link model is applicable to deployments where there are no
   shared services in the ASN.  Such deployments are typical of service
   provider networks where a public access wireless network is being
   provided.  Cellular networks such as UMTS networks are an example.

3.3.  Ethernet Like Link Model

   This model describes a scheme for configuration and provisioning of
   an IEEE 802.16 networks so that it emulates a broadcast link in a
   manner similar to Ethernet.  Figure 4 illustrates an example of the
   Ethernet model.  This model essentially functions like an Ethernet
   link, which means the model works as described in [3], [4].

   One way to construct an Ethernet like link is to implement bridging
   between BSs and AR like switched Ethernet.  In the Figure 4, bridging
   performs link aggregation between BSs and AR.  Bridging also supports
   multcast packet filtering.  Another way to implement this model is by
   using VLAN function [12].

   In this model, an IPv6 prefix is shared by multiple MSs on top of
   IEEE 802.16 point-to-multipoint links.  Also this model supports

3.3.1.  Prefix Assignment

   Prefixes are assigned as specified in [3], [4].

3.3.2.  Address Autoconfiguration

   It is the same as described in [4].

3.3.3.  Duplicate Address Detection

   It is the same as described in [4].

   If the full Ethernet broadcast/multicast functions are not supported,
   the DAD procedure as specified in [4] does not adapt well.  In such
   case Relay DAD mechanism can be used.

3.3.4.  Considerations

3.3.4.1.  Reuse of existing standards

   All the IPv6 standards can be preserved or reused, but the scope is
   limited or some implementation changes for DAD or on-link multicast
   optimization may be required, if the full Ethernet broadcast/

   multicast functions are not supported.

3.3.4.2.  On-link Multicast Support

   On-link multicast can be emulated in unicast manner by efficiently
   bridging between all BSs with IEEE 802.16 providing the links between
   the MSs and the bridge on top of the BS.  Nevertheless, in case of
   bridging, direct inter-MSs communication may not be not allowed due
   to restrictions from the service providers.  Another way to emulate
   on-link multicast is to use VLAN.

3.3.4.3.  Consistency in IP Link Definition

   This model is consistent with IP link definition.

3.3.4.4.  Packet Forwarding

   When properly configured and assisted by a simple bridging or VLAN
   functions, IEEE 802.16 can emulate a simple broadcast network like
   Ethernet.

3.3.4.5.  Changes on Host Implementation

   No special impact on host implementation.

3.3.4.6.  Changes on Router Implementation

   No special impact on router implementation under a separated AR-BS
   model, if the bridging is implemented in BS.  Some networks e.g.
   WiMAX networks may require bridging or VLAN to be implemented in the
   AR (ASN Gateway).

3.3.5.  Applicability

   This model works with the Ethernet CS and is chosen by the WiMAX
   networks (e.g. fixed/nomadic deployment) by the WiMAX Forum Network
   Working Group.


4.  Renumbering

   If the downstream prefixes managed by the AR are involved in
   renumbering, it may be necessary to renumber each link under the AR.
   The point-to-point link model requires that each MN change its
   prefix, whereas the Shared IPv6 prefix and Ethernet Like Link models
   require changing prefixes of the link. [11] discusses recommended
   procedures for renumbering.

Internet-Draft         IPv6 Link Models for 802.16        September 2006


   If address autoconfiguration is used, the AR must withdraw the
   existing prefixes and advertise the new ones.  Since each MS
   irrespective of the Link Model is on a separate point-to-point link
   at the MAC level because of the 802.16 connection oriented
   architecture, AR/BS send an RA withdrawing the old prefix and
   advertising the new to each MS.  However the Ethernet like link
   model, the AR may send single RA to BS, which would be sending
   separate RAs to each MS.  If the Shared IPv6 link model and Ethernet
   like Link model uses the downlink multicast capability, a single RA
   would be sufficient to renumber the link.

   If DHCP is used to assign addresses, either the DHCP address lease
   lifetime may be reduced prior to the renumbering event to encourage
   MSs to renew their addresses quickly or a DHCP Reconfigure message
   may be sent to each of the MSs by the server to cause them to renew
   their addresses.  In either case, the number of messages sent is same
   for all link models.  After MSs have changed their addresses, the
   amount of DAD traffic is same for all types of link models.


5.  Effect on Dormant Mode

   If the network needs to deliver packets to an MS which is in dormant
   mode, the network pages the MS.  The MS which is monitoring the
   paging channel receives the page and transitions out of the dormant
   mode to active mode.  It establishes connectivity with the network by
   requesting and obtaining the radio resources.  The network is then
   able to deliver the packets to the MS.  In many networks, packets
   destined to an MS in dormant mode are buffered at an entity in the
   network until connectivity is established.

   Support for dormant MSs is critical in mobile networks and hence it
   is a necessary feature.  Paging capability and optimizations possible
   for paging an MS are not either enhanced or handicapped by the link
   model itself.  However the multicast capability of within a link may
   cause for an MS to wake up for unwanted packet, this can be avoided
   by filtering the multicast packets and delivering the packets to only
   for MSs that are listening for particular multicast packets.  As the
   Shared IPv6 Prefix model does not have the multicast capability and
   point-to-point link model has only one node on the link, they do not
   have any effect on the dormant mode.  The Ethernet like link model
   may have the multicast capability, which requires filtering at the BS
   to support the dormant mode for the MSs.


6.  SeND Support

   SEND is fully supported by all models described in this document.

Internet-Draft         IPv6 Link Models for 802.16        September 2006


   And SeND should be used to secure the neighbor discovery procedures.


7.  Conclusions and Relevant Link Models

   Ethernet Like Link model would be used when the deployment requires
   the use of Ethernet CS as this is the only model being proposed for
   the Ethernet CS and running IPv6 over Ethernet is well understood.

   For IPv6 CS, point-to-point link model appears to the choice because
   of its simplicity for performing the DAD as well as the operational
   experience of p2p links from 3G networks.  However the IPv6 shared
   prefix model would be defined if there is any interest from service
   provider community.


8.  Security Considerations

   This document provides the analysis of various IPv6 link models for
   802.16 based networks and this document as such does not introduce
   any new security threats.  Nonetheless, this document encourages
   usage of SeND for securing the neighbor discovery messages on any
   IPv6 link.  Also the Relay DAD procedure, which requires the
   maintenance of address cache, may be attacked from rogue users by
   forming large number of IPv6 addresses to overflow the address cache,
   this may require service providers to limit the number of IPv6
   address for a user at a given instance.


9.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.
