  Requirements of Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) for Central Control
                     draft-li-rtgwg-igp-cc-reqs-00

Abstract

   Interior Gateway Protocol(IGP) such as IS-IS or OSPF is a fundamental
   building block for traditional routing system which is based on
   distributed computation model.  Routing in networks based on
   centralized computation model such as Software Defined Network(SDN)
   may require special IGP extension to facilitate its operation in
   multi-domain, multi-region, or multi-layer networks.

   This document introduces an architecture of deploying IGP for
   central-controlled network, but it does not aim to provide a detailed
   description of all the architectural components.  It also specifies a
   set of functional requirements which can be fulfilled by IGP with
   proper extension for the central-controlled network.

1.  Introduction

   Interior Gateway Protocol(IGP) such as IS-IS[ISO.10589.1992] or
   OSPF[RFC2328] is a fundamental building block for traditional routing
   system which is based on distributed computation model.  Routing in
   networks based on centralized computation model such as Software
   Defined Network(SDN) may require special IGP extension to facilitate
   its operation in multi-domain, multi-region, or multi-layer networks.

   This document introduces an architecture of deploying IGP for
   central-controlled network, but it does not aim to provide a detailed
   description of all the architectural components.  It also specifies a

   set of functional requirements which can be fulfilled by IGP with
   proper extension for the central-controlled network.

   The internet is the most popular network which is based on
   distributed computation model.  The architecture and requirements
   this document proposes here are not going to be used to contradict or
   replace current internet model but rather can be used to augment
   functionality in the scenarios where the Internet model can not
   supply adequate solutions.

3.  Overview of Central Control Architecture

   This section gives an overview of the architecture of IGP-based
   central control.  It can help to get a good understanding when
   reading the detailed requirements in next section.  As stated above,
   this section does not aim to provide a detailed explanation for each
   building block of the architecture.

3.1.  Reference Model

   The following figure depicts a typical architecture of IGP-based
   central control.  It consists of two essential network elements:
   controller and client.  The controller controls all the clients
   within its administrative domain by communicating with them using IGP
   protocols such as IS-IS or OSPF.  And the controllers will also
   exchange the information between each other through some protocol
   extensions which is out of scope of this document.

3.2.  Deployment Mode

   The controller can run on a general-purpose server or a network
   device.  If the controller runs on a network device, it supports both
   central-controlled functionality and forwarding functionality.  In
   this scenario, besides the centralized point of controlling, the
   controller can also work as a centralized point of forwarding to
   receive traffic from one node to others.  The forwarding model in
   this scenario is just like hub-spoke forwarding model.  If the
   controller runs on a server, it will not be involved in the actual
   forwarding.  It only works as the centralized point of control to
   manage the forwarding behaviors of the nodes.  In this scenario the
   traffic will be distributed in the controlled nodes.

   More than one controller can be deployed in a central control domain.
   These controllers can work on master-slave mode or load-sharing mode.

4.  Requirements of IGP for Central Control

4.1.  Building Connectivity

   IGP protocol is essential to establish connectivity in the central
   control domain.  When a new device connects to the this domain, the
   connectivity with the other nodes and the controller should be built
   at first.  The connectivity SHOULD be achieved through Plug and Play
   way since the number of devices in this domain can be huge.  Base on

Internet-Draft   Requirements of IGP for Central Control       July 2014


   this initialization process, the controller can download the
   necessary configuration to this new node to drive it to set up
   adjacency with its neighbors and the controller.  Then the topology
   information can be synchronized in the central control domain and the
   connectivity can be built.

   REQ 01: IGP extensions SHOULD be provided to building the
   connectivity between the central controller and client nodes for the
   purpose of operation and management.

4.2.  Roles Auto-Discovery

   As stated in the architecture, there are two basic roles in the
   central control domain: controllers and clients.  Both controllers
   and clients MUST advertise their own roles in proper IGP protocol
   extensions through IGP flooding mechanism.  Through the role
   information flooded in the network, if there are multiple central
   controllers in the network, the controller can determine which client
   nodes should be under its control or the client nodes can decide
   which controller to join in.

   REQ 02: IGP extensions SHOULD be provided to advertise controller and
   client role information to determine the control domain of the
   central controller.

4.3.  Capability Advertisement

   Along with the role information, the capability information of the
   controller and clients nodes can also be advertised for the purpose
   of capability negotiation.  For example, if the controller has the
   capability to control the edge client nodes of the network, after the
   capability information is advertised, the edge client nodes can set
   up BGP sessions with the central controller.

   REQ 03: IGP extensions SHOULD be provided to advertise the capability
   information of the central controller and client nodes.

4.4.  Network Topology Acquirement

   In traditional network, it is very difficult for the application to
   get and use the topology information.  The topology information is
   only contained and expressed in protocols' specific link-state
   messages which are obscure and difficult to fetch in application's
   defend.  In some scenarios, the application has to communicate with
   these protocols directly to get the necessary information.  In the
   IGP-based central controlled network, the topology acquirement
   procedures SHOULD be simplified.  All topology related information
   SHOULD be able to be collected by IGP.  Thus the complexity of

Internet-Draft   Requirements of IGP for Central Control       July 2014


   network operation and management can be reduced.  In the IGP-base
   central controlled network, the controller can get the whole topology
   information of the central control domain which can be easily
   provided to applications through public interface.

   REQ 04: IGP extensions SHOULD be provided to unify the topology
   information acquirement.

4.5.  Application Specific Requirement

   Based on the central control architecture, new application can be
   proposed such as:

   -- Centralized MPLS TE: In the IGP-based Central Controlled network,
   the controller can implement better traffic engineering functionality
   based on complete topology information and state information of the
   whole network.

   -- Applications based on global label allocated by IGP:
   [I-D.li-mpls-global-label-usecases] proposes possible use cases based
   on MPLS global label.  IGP extensions can be introduced to allocate
   global labels by the central controller to client nodes to support
   corresponding applications.

   These IGP extensions are application-specific and out of scope of
   this document.

4.6.  Summary of IGP Extension Requirements

   REQ 01: IGP extensions SHOULD be provided to building the
   connectivity between the central controller and client nodes for the
   purpose of operation and management.

   REQ 02: IGP extensions SHOULD be provided to advertise controller and
   client role information to determine the control domain of the
   central controller.

   REQ 03: IGP extensions SHOULD be provided to advertise the capability
   information of the central controller and client nodes.

   REQ 04: IGP extensions SHOULD be provided to unify the topology
   information acquirement.
