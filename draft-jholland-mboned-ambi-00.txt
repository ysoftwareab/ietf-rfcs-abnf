                  Asymmetric Manifest Based Integrity
                     draft-jholland-mboned-ambi-00

Abstract

   This document introduces Asymmetric Manifest-Based Integrity (AMBI).
   AMBI allows each receiver of a stream of multicast packets to check
   the integrity of the contents of each packet in the data stream.
   AMBI operates by passing cryptographically verifiable manifests for
   the data packets, over out-of-band communication channels.

1.  Introduction

   Multicast transport poses security problems that are not easily
   addressed by the same security mechanisms used for unicast transport.

   The "Introduction" sections of the documents describing TESLA
   [RFC4082], and TESLA in SRTP [RFC4383], and TESLA with ALC and NORM
   [RFC5776] present excellent overviews of the challenges unique to
   multicast authentication, briefly summarized here:

   o  A MAC based on a symmetric shared secret cannot be used because
      each packet has multiple receivers that do not trust each other.

   o  Asymmetric per-packet signatures can handle only very low bit-
      rates because of the computational overhead.

   o  An asymmetric signature of a larger message comprising multiple
      packets requires reliable receipt of all such packets, something
      that cannot be guaranteed in a timely manner even for protocols
      that do provide reliable delivery, and the retransmission of which

      may anyway exceed the useful lifetime for data formats that can
      otherwise tolerate some degree of loss.

   Aymmetric Manifest-Based Integrity (AMBI) specifies a method for
   receivers or middle boxes to cryptographically authenticate and
   verify the integrity of a stream of packets, by communicating packet
   "manifests" (described in Section 2.3) via an out-of-band
   communication channel that provides authentication and verifiable
   integrity.

   Each manifest contains cryptographic hashes of packet payloads
   corresponding to specific packets in the authenticated data stream.

   Three ways to authenticate a manifest are defined:

   o  Asymmetric signature of a message containing the manifest.

   o  Authenticated unicast stream providing a sequence of manifests.

   o  Using one of the prior two constructions to bootstrap a root
      manifest containing authentication information for further
      manifests.  This we term "recursive authentication".

   When using asymmetric signatures, recursive authentication allows the
   sender to amortize the computational overhead for a single asymmetric
   signature across enough data packets to sustain high data rates.
   When using a secure unicast stream, the recursive verification allows
   for scaling the authenticated data stream to more receivers than can
   otherwise be sustained with a limited set of trusted servers.

   Upon successful verification of the contents of a manifest and
   receipt of any subset of the corresponding data packets, the receiver
   has proof of the integrity of the contents of the data packets listed
   in the manifest.

   An "anchor message", described in Section 2.2, provides the link
   between an authenticated data stream and the out-of-band channel of
   manifests that authenticates it.

   Authenticating the integrity of the data packets depends on:

   o  authentication of the anchor message that provides the linkage
      between the manifest channel and the data stream; and

   o  the secrecy and cryptographic strength of private keys used for
      signing manifests, or the authentication of the secure unicast
      streams used for transmitting manifests; and

   o  the difficulty of generating a collision for the packet hashes in
      the manifest.

1.1.  Comparison with TESLA

   AMBI and TESLA [RFC4082] and [RFC5776] attempt to achieve a similar
   goal of authenticating the integrity of streams of multicast packets.
   AMBI imposes a higher overhead, as measured in the amount of extra
   data required, than TESLA imposes.  In exchange, AMBI provides non-
   repudiation (which TESLA does not), and relaxes the requirement for
   establishing an upper bound on clock synchronization between sender
   and receiver.

   This tradeoff enables new capabilities for AMBI, relative to TESLA.
   In particular, when receiving multicast traffic from an untrusted
   transit network, AMBI can be used by a middle box to authenticate
   packets from a trusted source before forwarding traffic through the
   network, and the receiver also can separately authenticate the
   packets.  (This use case is not possible with TESLA because the data
   packets can't be authenticated until a key is disclosed, so either
   the middlebox has to forward data packets without first
   authenticating so that the receiver has them prior to key disclosure,
   or the middlebox has to hold packets until the key is disclosed, at
   which point the receiver can no longer establish their authenticity.)

1.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Protocol Specification

2.1.  Packet Identifiers

2.1.1.  Overview

   Packet identifiers are a sequence number contained within the
   authenticated payload of the packet.  This sequence number is used
   inside a manifest to associate each packet hash with a specific
   packet.  Each authenticated packet MUST contain a packet identifier.
   See Section 4.1 for a discussion of the security implications.

   This document defines a new UDP option in Section 2.1.4 for use as a
   packet identifier.

   Some multicast-capable transport protocols have a sequence number
   embedded in data packets in the protocol.  The sequence numbers in

Internet-Draft                    AMBI                         June 2018


   these protocols MAY be used instead of the new UDP option, to avoid
   introducing extra overhead in the authenticated data packets.

   In Section 2.1.2, Section 2.1.3, and Section 2.1.4, this document
   defines some sample ways to specify packet identifiers based on such
   sequence numbers embedded in existing protocols.

   Other appropriate sequence number systems may exist, such as the
   anti-replay Sequence Number field in Section 3.1 of [RFC6584], when
   NORM or FLUTE operates with an authentication profile that uses it
   (however, since that example already provides authentication, it is
   not added as an option in this document).  The AMBI anchor message
   format can be extended in future documents to support those or other
   suitable schemes by adding values to the registry defined in
   Section 3.

   In some deployments, in contrast to using the new UDP option, the
   approach of using an existing sequence number may carry a benefit
   because it requires no change to the stream of packets being
   authenticated, possibly enabling interoperability with legacy
   receivers.

2.1.2.  RTP Sequence Number

   Sequence number from Section 5.1 of [RFC3550].

   TBD: discussion of security consequences of using 16 bits- recommend
   a bigger hash in manifests for this case?

2.1.3.  SRTP Sequence Number

   Packet Index from Section 3.3.1 of [RFC3711].

2.1.4.  UDP Option

   Define a new UDP option [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-udp-options] (TBD2).

2.2.  Anchor Message

2.2.1.  Overview

   An anchor message provides the information that makes it possible to
   associate the manifests with the data packets they authenticate.  ID
   values that appear as text integers in the anchor message also appear
   in the manifest binary data, with the anchor message providing
   context on how to interpret the values.

   An anchor message MAY be discovered and transmitted by any means
   which provides adequate source authentication and data integrity to
   meet the security needs of the receiver.

   In order to support middle-box authentication, it is RECOMMENDED that
   senders arrange to distribute anchor messages according to the method
   outlined in Section 2.2.2.

2.2.2.  DNS-based Anchor URI Bootstrap

   When a middle box tries to process a join for a specific source, if
   it is configured to perform authentication on SSM multicast channels
   it can forward, it SHOULD make a DNS request for ambi.(reverse-
   source-ip).ip6.arpa or ambi.(reverse-source-ip).in-addr.arpa, for
   IPv6 or IPv4 source addresses.

   When AMBI is provided to authenticate traffic from this source IP,
   this domain name SHOULD be configured with a TXT field which contains
   a URI that can be used to securely fetch an anchor message that
   describes all the AMBI- authenticatable traffic from this source IP.

   Other methods MAY be used to discover and transfer an anchor message.
   The description of alternate methods is out of scope for this
   document.

   TBD: consider breaking up anchor message to avoid large, frequently
   changing anchors for sources with many groups.

   TBD: consider graceful rollover for anchors, instead of synchronized
   update of anchor hash.

2.3.  Manifests

2.3.1.  Overview

   A manifest cannot be interpreted except in context of a known anchor
   message.  In order for a manifest to be considered as potentially
   authenticating a set of packets, the anchor version MUST match the
   value in a known unexpired anchor message, and the hash MUST match
   the hash of the contents of that anchor message, according to the
   /anchor/self/hash_algorithm and /anchor/self/hash_bits fields, in
   order for a manifest to be accepted for use as evidence of
   authenticity and integrity.

3.  IANA Considerations

   TBD1: Request a "Specification Required" registry for Packet
   identifier methods, from https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5226#section-
   4.1 . Reserve anything beginning with "experimental:"?

   TBD2: Add a new entry to the "UDP Option Kind" numbers registry:
   https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tsvwg-udp-options-
   02#section-14

   TBD: check guidelines in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5226 and
   remove this paragraph

   Example from: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5226#section-5.1

4.  Security Considerations

4.1.  Packet Identifiers

   TBD: explain attack from generating malicious packets and then
   looking for collisions, as opposed to having to generate a collision
   including a sequence number and then hitting a match

   TBD: DNSSEC vis-a-vis anchor url discovery.  (we need a diagram about
   for middle-box handling of a revers-path propagated join?)  Explain
   why malicious DNS could deny service, but cannot cause accepting
   attack packets.

   TBD: follow the rest of the guidelines: https://tools.ietf.org/html/
   rfc3552
