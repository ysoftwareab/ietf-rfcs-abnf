Abstract 
    
   This document defines an architectural framework for mobility 
   management (MM) in general with an emphasis on localized mobility 
   management (LMM). MM requires new architectural entities to be added 
   to the Internet Protocol version 4 and version 6. Also the 
   availability of mobility management must be advertised by these 
   entities extending ICMPv4 and v6. The document identifies these 
   entities as routing proxies (RP) and defines abstractly the behaviour 
   of RPs and their interactions with the existing entities and the 
   router/agent advertisements that RP needs to issue in order to let 
   its presence known. Basic architecture can be optimized by either 
   informing the end nodes in order to achieve route optimization and/ 
   or by localizing mobility management. LMM itself requires new 
   entities identified as localized routing proxies or localized 
   mobility agents (LMA) to be introduced to the basic architectures of 
   mobility management. The behaviour of LMA is abstractly defined. The 
   document also identifies a number of open issues whose resolution is 
   crucial to the standardization of LMM protocols.

  1. Introduction 
   Terminal mobility is an essential component of seamless connectivity 
   of the mobile nodes roaming in the Internet and linking themselves to 
   the network using different link technologies, wireless or wired. 
   Terminal mobility in the Internet is handled by global mobility 
   management. Global mobility management enables the mobile nodes to 
   change their point of attachment to the network and yet keep their 
   home addresses. As home address stays the same, the flow of datagrams 
   from the Internet is seamless and the sessions are not disrupted.  
    
   Global mobility management introduces at the home network a new 
   entity called home routing proxy (HRP). In IP version 4, a new local 
   entity called foreign routing proxy (FRP) may be used. There are two 
   base protocols for global mobility management: Mobile IP version 4 
   [3] and version 6 [2]. Base Mobile IP protocols define handover 
   procedures to be used in case the mobile node changes subnets. The 
   mobile node (MN) has to register its care-of address with the routing 
   proxy (RP) at the home network called home agent (HA) and with 
   corresponding nodes (CN) in order to divert the data flow into the 
   new subnet.  
    
   As the number of roaming users increases, e.g. in wireless networks, 
   the ways must be found to decrease the latency involved in 
   registering with far away HA and CNs and to increase the efficiency 
   of handovers by localizing mobility management.  
    
   Localized mobility management is used for reducing registration 
   signaling with the home agent and correspondent nodes. In a local 
   domain, new entities called localized mobility agents (LMA) are 
   introduced to act as local home agents. The mobile node gets a domain 
   or regional care of address and registers it with HA and CNs (if 
   route optimization is used). The present and any future local care of 
   addresses are registered only with LMAs. Therefore LMM reduces the 
   latency of the registration messages sent in the Internet and also 
   leads to increase the handover speed. Registration with HA and CNs 
   occurs again only if MN moves out to a new domain. 
    
    
     
   The document continues as follows:  Section 2 defines the 
   terminology. Section 3 gives a generic architecture for global 
   mobility management in order to introduce the new entities named home 
   routing proxy and foreign routing proxy. Section 4 gives a generic 
   architecture for LMM placing various entities such as the layer 2 
   entities of access points, access routers, localized mobility agents 
   and the corresponding node and the home routing proxy. Section 5 is 
   on Mobile IPv4 considerations. Section 6 lists open issues. Section 7 
   is on security considerations.

3.1 Generic Architecture 
   In Fig. 1, AR is the subnet's default router and the border router 
   (BR) plays no specific role in the mobility management other than 
   routing the datagrams. The home routing proxy (HRP) is the entity in 
   charge of mobility management of the subnet∆s nodes. As such HRP 
   announces its services using ICMP router advertisements and mobile 
   nodes (MN) get the address of HRP to be used when roaming. 
    
   A home network may have several HRPs common to the border router. 
   Replication of HRPs is desirable for reliability and scalability 
   purposes. In case of many HRPs in the same home network, the load 
   balancing between them might be desirable. 
    
   When MN is in a visited network, it acquires a co-located care of 
   address (CoA) using either stateful or stateless address acquisition 
   techniques. Registration of this address with HRP is a key component 
   of mobility management.  
    
   Registration enables HRP to update its lookup list, aka binding 
   cache, binding the home address of MN to its co-located care-of 
   address. Upon successful registration, HRP MUST perform proxy 
   neighbor advertisement with which HRP captures datagrams destined to 
   the home address of MN. 
    
   Registration MUST only create soft-state. At the expiry of the 
   registration life time, registration is performed again until MN 
   returns home network.

   HRP treats the datagrams destined to MN when not at home network as 
   requests to be replied by MN. HRP proxies AR in delivering the 
   datagrams. HRP MUST encapsulate these requests and send them to LCoA. 
   Encapsulation MAY use IP-in-IP encapsulation or some other standard 
   encapsulation method. HRP MUST use the lookup list in order to 
   correctly identify MN. The process of delivering the requests to MN 
   MUST be stateless, i.e. HRP as to the eventual reception by MN in its 
   visited network.   
    
   Corresponding nodes (CN) continue to use the home address of MN and 
   the mobility management is transparent to CNs. However, the proxied 
   routing, aka triangle routing of datagrams from HRP to MN in visited 
   network is a cause for concern especially for CNs in the visited 
   network, etc.  
    
   Triangle routing can be avoided using route optimization in which CNs 
   send their datagrams directly to the visited network. Route 
   optimization which is discussed next in Section 3.2 leads to the 
   direct involvement of CNs in the mobility management.  
    
   The latency of registration messages between RPs and MNs is a cause 
   of another concern with mobility management and the solution leads us 
   to the localized mobility management (LMM). LMM is discussed  later 
   in Section 4. 
    
3.2 Route Optimization 
   Ideal mobility management with no involvement of routing proxies can 
   be achieved if CNs can acquire the latest care-of address of MN and 
   bind it with the home address and forward the datagrams to the care-
   of address. This process is called route optimization in mobility 
   management. 
    
   After receiving the first datagram HRP MAY register MN∆s care-of 
   address with CN. MN itself MAY register its care-of address with CN. 
   CN MUST keep a lookup list, aka binding cache to bind the home 
   address to the care-of address of all MNs that it has active 
   sessions. 
    
   Source routing is used in route optimized datagrams. Route optimized 
   packets from CN MUST carry the home address as the destination 
   address and MUST NOT use encapsulation. Routing extension headers are 
   the proper mechanism to use in IP version 6. 
    
   Latency of the registration messages between MN and CN is a concern 
   for optimization. The solution is to use localized mobility 
   management (LMM) as discussed in Section 4. 
3.3 IPv4 Considerations 
   Due to the lack of a stateless address configuration in IPv4 a new 
   entity MAY be added on the visited subnet to give MNs a care-of 
   address. This entity will be called foreign routing proxy (FRP). FRP 
   MUST be the default router for MN.

                  Architectural Framework for G&L MM      October 2002 
 
 
   FRP MUST advertise its mobility services using ICMP, aka agent 
   advertisements. MN MUST be able to solicit an agent advertisement in 
   the process of determining the existence of any FRP in the visited 
   network. 
    
   After configuring the care-of address, MN MUST register the address 
   with HRP via FRP. FRP must deliver the registration reply from HRP to 
   FRP and update its lookup list. 
    
   FRP MUST decapsulate datagrams from HRP and then deliver them to MN. 
   FRP consults its lookup list in the delivery. 
4. LMM Architectures 
    
   An optimization to mobility management is to use localized mobility 
   management in which HRP functionality is replicated in the domain 
   using local routing proxies (LRP). We call LRP a localized mobility 
   agent in order to align the terminology with LMM requirements 
   document [4]. Figure 2 shows a generic architecture. 
    
   We assume Mobile IP version 4 [3] and version 6 [2] as the standard 
   solutions to the mobility management described in Section 3 above. 
   Home routing proxy is referred to as the home agent (HA) as in the 
   base protocols.

   entity called local mobility agent (LMA). There are layer 2 entities 
   called access points (AP) that enable MN to connect to the access 
   router (AR) for IP connectivity to the Internet. ARs are connected 
   to LMAs. LMAs may be interconnected in different ways. ARs MAY also 
   be configured to act as LMAs at the lowest level. 
    
   The LMA that is connected to the Internet is called the Gateway LMA 
   (GLMA).       
    
4.2 LMA Architectures 
   LMAs can be connected into a tree topology as shown in Figure 2. GLMA 
   is located at the root of the tree. MN MUST form a regional care of 
   address from GLMA. MN after receiving the address of GLMA can 
   configure a regional care of address on GLMA's subnet. 
    
   GLMA and other LMAs keep a regional binding cache. A binding cache 
   entry is created for an MN with each regional registration. The 
   binding cache entry at GLMA binds the home address of MN with the 
   next LMA downstream. The entries in other LMAs are formed in a 
   similar way. ARs are the default routers of MN in the subnet. ARs are 
   not LMAs.

   This architecture requires special care on the IP datagrams to be 
   routed downstream.  The datagrams coming from the home agent 
   tunneled to GLMA. GLMA decapsulates it and finds the home address of 
   MN as the destination address. Using the binding cache entry GLMA 
   reencapsulates the datagram to the corresponding lower care-of 
   address. 
    
   In Mobile IPv6, CNs send route optimized packets to MN.  Route 
   optimized packets are processed by GLMA by first finding the home 
   address of MN in the routing header and then checking the regional  
   binding cache entry in order to get the next LMA address to forward 
   the packets to. GLMA then replaces the destination address with the 
   downstream LMA address. LMAs downstream forward route optimized 
   packets by modifying the destination address and this continues 
   until MN receives the packet. 
    
   MN registers its LCoA with GLMA first time in the domain. In 
   subsequent handoffs in the domain, MN registers with lower LMAs in 
   the hierarchy which means reduced latency in registration signaling.  
    
   Two level hierarchy can also be used as shown in Figure 4. ARs in the 
   figure MAY act like LMAs in this case Figure 4 represents a two level 
   hierarchy. 
    
   IP datagram forwarding downstream for tunneled packets from MN∆s HA 
   is done by consulting the regional binding cache. The packet is 
   decapsulated and then tunneled to MN∆s local care-of address. Route 
   optimized packets from CNs are tunneled to MN's local care-of address 
   if LMA has a binding cache entry for the final destination.   
    
   LMAs may not need to know the home address of MNs. Regional binding 
   cache SHOULD bind RCoA with LCoA. An alternative downstream packet 
   processing can be done as follows: LMA captures the packet addressed 
   to RCoA using proxy neighbor advertisements and encapsulates the 
   packet using LCoA as destination address and sends it downstream. 
   The packet is decapsulated by MN and the other LMAs in hierarchy are 
   not involved. 
    
   LMM MUST be transparent to the home routing proxy (HRP) or the home 
   agent (HA) operation. LMM protocols MUST not induce any new action on 
   HRPs. 
4.3 Domain change detection 
   It is critical for the operation of any LMM protocol that MNs should 
   be able to know if it is in its home domain (site) or in a visited 
   domain. In neighbor discovery, routers advertise subnet prefixes. 
   Subnet prefixes are obtained from site prefixes. Therefore routers 
   can advertise site prefixes as part of neighbor discovery. This way 
   MN can detect domain changes as described in [6]. 
    
   Presently there is no standard means of obtaining site prefixes and 
   this restricts MNs ability to detect domain changes. There are other 
   restrictions associated with this, e.g. site-local addresses   can 
   not be used as home addresses [7].

   Routers can advertise site prefixes as an extension required by LMM. 
   MNs should be able to get the site prefix from RAs coming from LMAs 
   and therefore detect any change of the domain. When the domain change 
   is detected MN must perform regional registrations.  
    
4.4 Route optimization 
   From the architectures in Figures 3 and 4, it is clear that after 
   regional registrations are performed, the routing of datagrams from 
   CN to MN is triangle routing. LMA(s) receive the datagrams and then 
   tunnel them to MN. The difference from HA anchored triangle routing 
   is reduction in the number of hops. In this LMM induced triangle 
   routing, the IP header added for tunneling can be considered as the 
   highest concern for performance reductions compared with route 
   optimization which uses routing headers that occupy smaller number of 
   bytes.

   The tunneling overhead can be avoided in some cases such as when the 
   CNs are in the same link as MN as follows:  
   If the local access router is an LMA, MN MUST select this LMA; 
   otherwise MN MUST use its LCoA to communicate with local CNs.    
    
   When there are routing loops, e.g. AR1 and AR2 are directly connected 
   in Figure 3, some CN's routing distance may become shorter to MN 
   directly, rather than going through LMA. As a result, LMM is causing 
   an unavoidable tunneling overhead as well as non-optimal routing. 
   Routing loops may manifest in more complicated scenarios in which a 
   distant CN is connected to a border router (BR1) and the LMA is 
   connected to a different border router (BR2) and the CN is of shorter 
   distance to MN without involving LMA than with involving LMA. Such an 
   architecture is given in [8]. The routing loop in this example is 
   also created because of a direct link between ARs.  
    
   Problems associated with routing loops can be avoided as follows: 
   Routers MUST be configured to send router advertisements with LMA 
   extension on certain interfaces, e.g. avoiding AR to AR direct links. 
   GLMA MUST be the only node in the domain to which CNs outside the 
   domain send datagrams. 
    
5. Mobile IPv4 Considerations 
   GLMA in Mobile IPv4 acts like a gateway foreign agent (GFA). Other 
   LMAs become regional foreign agents (RFA). AR is the Foreign agent 
   (FA). FAs MUST be LMM-aware in Mobile IPv4. 
    
    
   If a tree architecture is used, the agent advertisements MUST be 
   extended to advertise the hierarchy of addresses to MNs. This is done 
   by GFA first putting its address in its advertisements and by each 
   RFA attaching its address into the advertisement. This way the MNs 
   receive the addresses in the path to GFA.  
    
   In Mobile IPv4 agent advertisements do not carry site prefixes. There 
   must be other mechanisms used for domain change detection. Network 
   access identifiers (NAI) can be used for this purpose [9]. MN 
   compares the realm part of its NAI with the realm part of NAIs of 
   LMAs and decides on the first domain change. Subsequent domain 
   changes are similarly detected. 
    
   Using network access identifiers, MN may be assigned a different home 
   address by a different home agent every time it changes its FA. This 
   is called dynamic home agent assignment [10]. Dynamic home agent 
   assignment is equivalent to LMM if the new home agent is always 
   chosen from the same domain in which FA resides. 
    
   Regional care of address is the address of GFA in Mobile IPv4. MN can 
   also detect the domain change by comparing its regional care of 
   address with the address coming from the agent advertisements.

6. Open Issues with LMM 
   Whether or not it is left to the LMM protocol to solve domain change 
   detection problem.  
     
   Whether or not base MIPv4/v6 operation and LMM operation can be mixed 
   once LMM start to be used. This is important for efficiency reasons. 
   It may be advantageous for MN to communicate CNs in the same domain 
   using the base protocol and to communicate CNs outside the domain 
   using LMM. 
    
   LMA discovery is facilitated with the use of router advertisement 
   extensions. Static configuration can also be envisaged using 
   configuration protocols such as DHCP. It is also possible to let MNs 
   discover using ICMP Echo Requests and Replies [11]. 
    
   Whether or not a hierarchy of LMAs should be used. Hierarchy of LMAs 
   offer the advantage of better scalability and reliability. The 
   registration signaling latency is also reduced since every time MN 
   hands off to a different AR in the domain, the regional registration 
   goes up in the hierarchy until the common lowest ancestor in the tree. 
    
   If LMAs are configured hierarchically then it is not clear if the 
   hierarchy should be advertised in the router advertisements. It is 
   only necessary that each LMA offer its regional care-of address. 
    
   Whether or not the regional care of address (RCoA) can be used as the 
   source address by MN. 
    
   For Mobile IPv4 based LMM, while regional care of address is a public 
   address, the local care of addresses can be private. This may give an 
   incentive for the deployment of LMM protocols. On the other hand the 
   requirement for FAs to be LMM-aware brings deployment difficulties. 
    
7. Security Considerations 
    
   Registration messages exchanged between MN and CN for route 
   optimization MUST be secured. Return routability can be used for this 
   purpose. Return routability has the negative effect of increasing the 
   latency of registration messages.  
    
   Registration messages exchanged between LMA and MN MUST be 
   authenticated. MN MUST share an authentication key with all LMAs that 
   it communicates. LMM helps reduce the security problem associated 
   with the registration messages exchanged between MN and CN since MN 
   does not need to send any new registration messages (binding updates) 
   as long as it stays in the same domain.
