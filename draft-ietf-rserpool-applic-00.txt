Abstract

   This document describes the applicability of the reliable server pool
   architecture and protocols to applications which want to have High
   avialebility services. This is accomplished by using redundant
   servers and failover between servers of the same pool in case of
   server failure. Processing load in a pool may de distributed/shared
   between the members of the pool according to a certain policy. Also
   some guidance is given on the choice of underlying transport protocol
   (and corresponding transport protocol mapping) for transporting
   application data and Rserpool specific control data.

1. INTRODUCTION

   Reliable server pooling provides protocols for providing higly
   available services. The services are located in pool of redundant
   servers and if a server fails, another server will take over. The
   only requirement put on these servers belonging to the pool is that
   if state is maintained by the server, this state must be transfered
   to the other server taking over. The mechanism for transfering this
   state information is NOT part of the Reliable server pooling
   architecture and/or protocols and must be provided by other
   protocols.

   The goal is to provide server based redundancy. Transport and network
   level redundancy are handle by the transport and network layer
   protcols.

   The application may choose to distribute its traffic over the servers
   of the pool conforming to a certain policy.

   The application wishing to make use of Rserpool protocols may use
   different transport layers(such as UDP, TCP and SCTP). However some
   transport layers may have restrictions build in in the way they might
   be operating in the Rserpool architecture and its protocols.

1.1 Scope

   The scope of this document is to explore the different ways that
   Reliable server pool protocols can be used in order to provide a
   higly available service towards applications with different
   requirements.

1.2 Terminology

   The terms are commonly identified in related work and can be found in
   the Aggregate Server Access Protocol and Endpoint Name Resolution
   Protocol Common Parameters documentRFC COMM [5].

2. Reliable serverpool

2.1 Architecture

   A overview of the reliable server pool architecture is given in the
   Rserpool architecture document RFC ARCH [2].

   The Rserpool architecture is made up of clients(Pool Users - PU) and
   servers(Pool Elements - PE). Both PU and PE's can be grouped into a
   pool in which a PE provides a service(File transfer, storage, bank
   transaction) to a PU. The PU's  may try to find out via the endpoint
   resolution protocol(ENRP) which PE's are active. The PU can set up a
   communication channel with a particular PE(chosen out of the server
   pool) by using the Aggregate Server Access Protocol (ASAP) or by
   using directly any of the transport protcols(UDP/TCP/SCTP/RTP). ASAP
   may be running on top of UDP, TCP or SCTP.

   The minimum mode of using Rserpool is to use only the ENRP for
   Endpoint name resolution. The PU may setup the client - server
   communication WITHOUT ASAP, but using present transport
   protocols(such as UDP, TCP..)

   The normal use of Rserpool is to use ENRP for Enpoint name resolution
   and  ASAP for client - server communication. ASAP may be using as
   underlying transport protocol UDP, TCP or SCTP.

2.2 ASAP/ENRP applicability

2.2.1 Minimal Rserpool service

   The minimum service provided by Rserpool is the use of ENRP for
   Endpoint name resolution. The ENRP procol may be running over TCP or
   SCTP.

   o  Endpoint name resolution

   o  no automatic failover from one PE to another, has to be done by
      the application itself

   o  bussinesscard or cookie mechanism not possible

   o  May be used by allready existing applications which do not want to
      change the interface between PU and PE.

   o  Only PU-NS and PE-NS communication will use Rserpool protocols

2.2.2 Full Rserpool service

   The fullservice provided by Rserpool is the use of ENRP for Endpoint
   name resolution  and the Use of ASAP for PU - PE communication . ENRP
   may be running  over TCP or SCTP while ASAP may be running over TCP,
   SCTP, UDP or RTP.

   o  Endpoint name resolution

   o  automatic failover from one PE to another is transparent for the
      application itself

   o  bussinesscard exhange for determining if a PU is a pool or not. It
      allows the PE to treat the PU's as pool and use Rserpool protocols
      for it

   o  cookie mechanism can be used for state transfer between PE's

   o  May be used by allready existing applications which do not want to
      change the interface between PU and PE.

   o  All entities wil use Rspool protocols for communication withs
      their respective peers

3. Application and Control data Transport

3.1 Rserpool use between 2 pools

   Bussinesscards will allow to detect if their peer is part of a pool
   itself. Both the PU and the PE can be part of their own pools. If the
   PU or PE would fails, then the businesscard will have informed the
   respective peer to contact a alternative fellow PE/PU belonging to
   the pool.

3.2 state sharing via the cookie

   Every time a response is send back, a cookie could be send along the
   response. The cookie is "encrypted" and is stored by the PU, no
   modification at all it done to the cookie . If a PE fails then the
   cookie is send to a alternate PE, the PE check if the cookie is
   valid. The contents of the cookie is only provided and validated by
   the PE. It can be used for state sharing between the PE.

4. Transport protocols used by ENRP & ASAP

4.1 ASAP on top of UDP

   UDP is a unreliable message transport delivery protocol, so if a
   message gets lost due to a changeover of server(or client), then the
   message will not be retransmitted after changeover has occured. New
   messages will be sent to alternate server/client within the
   serverpool.

   This service may be of some importance to services where realtime
   constraints apply.(Example video servers: a few lost message ain't
   that important as long as the big bulk of messages get through). No
   conegstion control is done and as such no real measure of the
   congestion status on the server(or client) is taken into account,
   thus making loadsharing harder. Only the ENRP server responsible for
   that particular server pool will have a up to date view of the load
   distribution in the pool.

4.2 ASAP on top of TCP

   TCP provides full reliable delivery with congestion control of the
   message to its peer node. It provides for a single homed, single
   stream delivery of a byte stream from or to the server. Change over
   will retrieve the unsent messages and send them on another TCP
   connection to a different server of the server pool.

4.3 ASAP on top of SCTP

   PR-SCTP is the only know protocol which allows the choice of full,
   partial or no reliable delivery with congestion control of the
   message to its peer node. If the no-reliable delivery option is
   selected of SCTP, then ASAP will function as described in ASAP over
   UDP and including congestion control.

   if multihoming, streams, unsequenced  and/or assured delivery are
   required for the application, then SCTP should be used for ASAP. See
   SCTP aplicability statement RFC 3257 [9].

4.4 Address hiding

   If an application requires only a single address(due to memory
   constraints) to reach a pool element of a pool , then ASAP can
   provide one address at a time when quering the ENRP server. If that
   pool element fails, then the client must request a new address from
   the ENRP server, before it can fail-over(as it has no information
   about the other pool elements of the same pool except the pool
   handle). This is done by ASAP itself in the full Rserpool service,

   but must be done by the client software itself in minimal Rserpool
   service.

   This may require some buffering in the client during the failover.

5. Proxies and Rserpool

   Application which require absolutely no protocol changes to their
   clients, may be able to use Rserpool protocols by using a proxy
   between the client and the server pool. Neither ASAP nor ENRP is used
   by the client application, but the proxy employs ENRP and ASAP. The
   client will only know the IP address and portnumbers of the proxy to
   contact. This can be accomplished via normal DNS queries.

   The main drawback is that the proxy becomes the single point of
   failure for the connection between the client and the server.

6. Issues for Reliable Server pooling

6.1 State transfer accoss the server pool

   Rserpool protocols(ENRP and ASAP) do NOT provide any service for
   transfering state information of a application from one Processing
   Element(PE) to another.

7. Security considerations

   The protocols used in the Reliable server pool architecture only
   tries to increase the availability of the servers in the network.
   Rserpool protocols does not contain any protocol mechanisms which are
   directly related to user message authentication, integrity and
   confidentiality functions. For such features, it depends on the IPSEC
   protocols or on Transport Layer Security(TLS) protocols for its own
   security and on the architecture and/or security features of its user
   protocols.

   A overview of possible treats to Reliable Server pooll protcols is
   detailed in RFC TREAT [8].

   Rserpool architecture allows the use of different Transport protocols
   for its application and control data exchange. Those transport
   protocols may have mechanisms for reducing the risk of blind
   denial-of-service attacks and/or masquerade attacks. If such measures
   are required by the applications, then it is advised to check the
   SCTP applicability statement[RFC3057] for guidance on this issue.
