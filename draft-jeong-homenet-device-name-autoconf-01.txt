          DNS Name Autoconfiguration for Home Network Devices
              draft-jeong-homenet-device-name-autoconf-01

Abstract

   This document specifies an autoconfiguration scheme for DNS names of
   home network devices.  By this scheme, the DNS name of a home network
   device can be autoconfigured with the device's category and model in
   a home network.  This DNS name lets home residents easily identify
   each device for monitoring and remote-controlling it in a home
   network.

Internet-Draft        Homenet Device Name Autoconf        September 2014


1.  Introduction

   Many appliances (such as smart TV, refrigerator, air conditioner, and
   washing machine) in a home network have begun to have WiFi capability
   for monitoring and remote-controlling within a home network or from
   the Internet.  Also, Internet of Things (IoT) devices (such as light,
   meter, room temperature controller, and sensors) have been installed
   into home networks for the easy management of home environments.

   For the Internet connectivity of home network devices, a variety of
   parameters (e.g., IPv6 addresses, default routers, and DNS servers)
   can be automatically configured by Neighbor Discovery (ND) for IP
   Version 6, IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration, and IPv6 Router
   Advertisement (RA) Options for DNS Configuration
   [RFC4861][RFC4862][RFC6106].

   For these home appliances and IoT devices, the manual configuration
   of DNS names will be cumbersome and time-consuming as the number of
   them increases rapidly in a home network.  It will be good for such
   DNS names to be automatically configured such that they are readable
   to home residents.

   This document proposes an autoconfiguration scheme for DNS names of
   home network devices.  Since an autoconfigured DNS name contains the
   device category and model of a device, home residents can easily
   identify the device.  With this device category and model, they will
   be able to monitor and remote-control each device with mobile smart
   devices, such as smartphone and tablet.

1.1.  Applicability Statements

   It is assumed that home network devices have Ethernet or WiFi
   capability (e.g., IEEE 802.11 series [IEEE-802.11] [IEEE-802.11a]
   [IEEE-802.11b][IEEE-802.11g] [IEEE-802.11n]) and are connected to a
   local area network (LAN) or a wireless LAN (WLAN).

   Also, it is assumed that each home network device has a factory
   configuration (called device configuration) having device category
   (e.g., smart TV, smartphone, tablet, and refrigerator) and model
   (i.e., a specific model name of the device).  This device
   configuration can be read by the device for DNS name
   autoconfiguration.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology described in [RFC4861] and
   [RFC4862].  In addition, four new terms are defined below:

   o  Device Configuration: A factory configuration that has device
      category (e.g., smart TV, smartphone, tablet, and refrigerator)
      and model (i.e., a specific model name of the device).

   o  DNS Search List (DNSSL): The list of DNS suffix domain names used
      by IPv6 hosts when they perform DNS query searches for short,
      unqualified domain names [RFC6106].

   o  DNSSL Option: IPv6 RA option to deliver the DNSSL information to
      IPv6 hosts [RFC6106].

4.  Overview

   This document specifies an autoconfiguration scheme for a home
   network device using device configuration and DNS search list.
   Device configuration has device category and device model.  DNS
   search list has DNS suffix domain names that represent DNS domains of
   the home network having the home network device [RFC6106].

   As an IPv6 host, the home network device can obtain DNS search list
   through IPv6 Router Advertisement (RA) with DNS Search List (DNSSL)
   Option [RFC4861][RFC6106] or DHCPv6 with Domain Search List Option
   [RFC3315][RFC3736][RFC3646].

   The home network device can construct its DNS name with the
   concatenation of device category, device model, and domain name.
   Since there exist more than one device with the same model, the DNS
   name should have a unique identification to differentiate multiple
   devices with the same model.

   Since both RA and DHCPv6 can be simultaneously used for the parameter
   configuration for IPv6 hosts, this document considers the DNS name
   autoconfigurtion in the coexistence of RA and DHCP.

5.  DNS Name Autoconfiguration

   The DNS name autoconfiguration for a home network device needs the
   acquisition of DNS search list through either RA [RFC6106] or DHCPv6
   [RFC3646].  Once the DNS search list is obtained, the home network
   device autonomously constructs its DNS name(s) with the DNS search
   list and its device information.

5.1.  DNS Name Format

   A DNS name for a home network device has the following format as in
   Figure 1:

        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
        |   unique_id.device_model.device_category.domain_name    |
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

              Figure 1: Home Network Device's DNS Name Format

   Fields:

     unique_id          unique identifier to guarantee the uniqueness
                        of the DNS name in ASCII characters.  The
                        identifier MAY be a sequence number or
                        alphanumeric with readability, such as product
                        name.

     device_model       device's model name in ASCII characters.  It
                        is a product model name provided by the
                        manufacturer.

     device_category    device's category name in ASCII characters,
                        such as TV, refrigerator, air conditioner,
                        smartphone, tablet, light, and meter.

     domain_name        DNS domain name that is encoded according to
                        the specification of "Representation and use
                        of domain name" of RFC 3315.

5.2.  Procedure of DNS Name Autoconfiguration

   The procedure of DNS name autoconfiguration is performed through a
   DNSSL option delivered by either RA [RFC6106] or DHCPv6 [RFC3646].

5.2.1.  Procedure of Device Name Generation

   When as an IPv6 host a device receives a DNSSL option through either
   RA or DHCPv6, it checks the validity for the DNSSL option.  If the
   option is valid, the IPv6 host performs the DNS name
   autoconfiguration with each DNS suffix domain name in the DNSSL
   option as follows:

   1.  The host constructs its DNS name with the DNS suffix domain name
       along with device configuration and a selected identifier (as
       unique_id) that is considered unique.

Internet-Draft        Homenet Device Name Autoconf        September 2014


   2.  The host performs the uniqueness test of the constructed DNS
       name.  The uniqueness test is performed through duplicate address
       detection (DAD) procedure in ND [RFC4861][RFC4862].  See Section
       5.2.2 for the detailed test procedure.

   3.  If the DNS name is proven to be unique, it is used as the
       device's DNS name and the DNS autoconfiguration is done for the
       given DNS suffix domain name.  Otherwise, go to Step 1.

   When the DNS search list has more than one DNS suffix domain name,
   the IPv6 host repeats the above procedure until all of the DNS
   suffixes are used for the DNS name autoconfiguration.

5.2.2.  Uniqueness Test of Device DNS Name

   An IPv6 host generates an IPv6 address with 64-bit prefix from an RA
   option (or DHCPv6) and 64-bit hash value from the DNS name to be
   tested.  Before using such an IPv6 address associated with the DNS
   name, the IPv6 host performs the DAD to check whether the address
   belongs to another IPv6 host or not.  Note that the IPv6 host
   configures the IPv6 address corresponding to the DNS name as its
   address.  If the address belongs to another IPv6 host, it is
   considered that the DNS name corresponding to the address is occupied
   by a different host.  Thus, the IPv6 host selects another unique
   identifier (as unique_id) for a DNS name and repeats the uniqueness
   test of the new DNS name with the identifier.

   1.  The host computes the hash value of the DNS name to be tested for
       the uniqueness using a hash function (e.g., MD5 and SHA-1).  It
       takes the first 64 bits of the hash value from most significant
       bit.

   2.  The host performs the uniqueness test of the constructed DNS
       name.  The uniqueness test is performed through the DAD procedure
       in ND [RFC4861][RFC4862].

   3.  If the DNS name is proven to be unique with no response for the
       DAD, the device configures the DNS name and the corresponding
       IPv6 address as its own DNS name and address, respectively,
       returning the success of the uniqueness test.  Otherwise, return
       the failure of the uniqueness test.

5.2.3.  Collection of Device DNS Names

   Once as IPv6 hosts the devices have autoconfigured their DNS names,
   as a collector, any IPv6 node (i.e., router or host) in the same
   subnet can collect the device DNS names using IPv6 Node Information
   (NI) protocol [RFC4620].



Jeong & Park              Expires March 5, 2015                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft        Homenet Device Name Autoconf        September 2014


   For a collector to collect the device DNS names without any prior
   node information, a new NI query needs to be defined.  That is, a new
   ICMPv6 Code (e.g., 3) SHOULD be defined for the collection of the
   IPv6 host DNS names.  The Data field is not included in the ICMPv6
   header since the NI query is for all the IPv6 hosts in the same
   subnet.  The Qtype field for NI type type is set to 2 for Node Name.

   The query SHOULD be transmitted by the collector to a link-local
   multicast address for this NI query.  Assume that a link-local
   multicast address SHOULD be defined for device DNS name collection
   and that all the IPv6 hosts join this link-local multicast address
   for the device DNS name collection service.

   When an IPv6 host receives this query sent by the collector in
   multicast, it transmits its Reply with a random interval between zero
   and [Query Response Interval, as defined by Multicast Listener
   Discovery Version 2 [RFC3810].  This randomly delayed Reply allows
   the collector to collect the device DNS names with less frame
   collision probability by spreading out the Reply time instants.

   After the collector collects the device DNS names, it collects the
   IPv6 addresses corresponding to the DNS names by NI protocol
   [RFC4620].  For DNS name resolution service, the collector can
   register the pair(s) of DNS name and IPv6 address for each IPv6 host
   into a recursive DNS server known to the collector using DNS dynamic
   update [RFC2136].

6.  Location-Aware DNS Name Configuration

   A DNS name can include location information to let home residents
   easily identify the physical location of each device.  In this
   document, location is categorized into macro-location and micro-
   location according to whether the location is a physical location or
   device.

6.1.  Macro-Location-Aware DNS Name

   If location information (such as living room, kitchen, and bedroom)
   is available to a home network device, a keyword for the location can
   be used to construct a DNS name as subdomain name.  This location
   information lets home residents track the position of mobile devices
   (such as smartphone, tablet, and vacuum cleaning robot).  The
   physical location of the device is defined as macro-location for DNS
   naming.

   A subdomain name for macro-location MAY be placed between
   device_category and domain_name of the DNS name format in Figure 1.
   A localization scheme for device location is beyond the scope of this

   document.

6.2.  Micro-Location-Aware DNS Name

   An IoT device (e.g., refrigerator) can have multiple other IoT
   devices (e.g., containers of a refrigerator) within itself.  A device
   containing other devices is defined as micro-location for DNS naming.

   A subdomain name for micro-location MAY be placed between
   device_category and domain_name of the DNS name format in Figure 1.
   A localization scheme for micro-location is beyond the scope of this
   document.

   To denote both macro-location and micro-location into a DNS name, the
   following format is described as in Figure 2:

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | unique_id.device_model.device_category.mic_loc.mac_loc.domain_name|
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

              Figure 2: Location-Aware Device DNS Name Format

   Fields:

     unique_id          unique identifier to guarantee the uniqueness
                        of the DNS name in ASCII characters.  The
                        identifier MAY be a sequence number or
                        alphanumeric with readability, such as product
                        name.

     device_model       device's model name in ASCII characters.  It
                        is a product model name provided by the
                        manufacturer.

     device_category    device's category name in ASCII characters,
                        such as TV, refrigerator, air conditioner,
                        smartphone, tablet, light, and meter.

     mic_loc            device's micro-location, such as refrigerator.

     mac_loc            device's macro-location, such as kitchen.

     domain_name        DNS domain name that is encoded according to
                        the specification of "Representation and use
                        of domain name" of RFC 3315.
