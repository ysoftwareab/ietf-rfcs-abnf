Abstract

   This memo defines a new DHCP Relay Suboption for passing an arbitrary
   number of bytes defining what will be called the "Subscriber ID".
   This value is simply defined as a printable character string.  Its
   intended purpose is to give additional information which the DHCP
   server can use in address allocation.

Internet Draft        DHCP Subscriber ID Suboption          October 2004


1.0 Introduction

   The Remote-ID sub-option of the relay agent information option (also
   called option-82) are calculated based on network resources like ip-
   address of the NSAP, atm VP, atm VC. As a result, when moving a link
   to a different port, a different value is calculated. This holds true
   for every subscriber that is connected with the particular link and
   the links are connected to different service providers. When the
   subscriber moves, each Service Provider has to be informed of the
   change and all the Service Providers have to change their DHCP [2]
   settings for the affected customers at the same time.

   When the service delivered has not changed, every move involves
   administrative changes in Service Providers environment causing delay
   in the customer service.

   Therefore an additional Relay Suboption for the DHCP Relay Agent
   option is being introduced, to add a configurable printable character
   string to provide this information.  This unique id will enable the
   Service Provider to identify a subscriber and to assign/activate
   subscriber specific actions, e.g. assignment of host IP address,
   subnet mask, DNS, trigger accounting, etc. This specific field is de-
   coupled from the NAS-IP, since the users could be able to move from
   NAS termination points. Thus when a subscriber moves from one NAS to
   another, this would not result in a configuration change on the side
   of the DHCP server of the Service Provider.

   This memo describes a new DHCP Relay suboption which would carry a
   "Subscriber ID" value.  The value is a printable character string
   giving the name of the subscriber.

1.1 Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [1].

1.2 Terminology

VC         Virtual Channel.  Logical circuit created to ensure reliable
           communication between two network devices. A virtual circuit
           is defined by a VPI/VCI pair, and can be either permanent
           (PVC) or switched (SVC). Virtual circuits are used in Frame
           Relay and X.25. In ATM, a virtual circuit is called a virtual
           channel.

VP         Virtual Path.  Logical grouping of virtual circuits that
           connect two sites.

NAS        Network Access Server. Platform (or collection of platforms)
           that interfaces between the packet world (for example, the
           Internet) and the circuit world (for example, the PSTN).

NSAP       Network Service Access Point. Network addresses, as specified
           by ISO. An NSAP is the point at which OSI network service is
           made available to a transport layer (Layer 4) entity.

PSTN       Public Switched Telephone Network. General term referring to
           the variety of telephone networks and services in place
           worldwide.

NVT ASCII  Network Virtual Terminal American Standard Code for
           Information Interchange.  [6]


2.0 DHCP Relay Information Suboption Definition

   The Subscriber ID is a DHCP Relay Information Suboption.  The exact
   option code value is TBD.  The suboption takes the same form as other
   Relay Information Suboptions:

       Code   Len   Subscribe ID string
      +-----+-----+------+-----+-----+---
      | TBD |  n  |  v1  | v2  | v3  | ...
      +-----+-----+------+-----+-----+---


   The option minimum length (n) is 1.

   The "Subscriber ID string", in NVT ASCII, MUST NOT be NULL terminated
   since the length is specified in the "len" field.

   This option provides the DHCP server additional information upon
   which to make a determination of address to be assigned.  The DHCP
   server, if it is configured to support this option, should use this

   information in addition to other options included in the DHCPDISCOVER
   packet in order to assign an IP address for the DHCP client.

   As per [3], the contents of the entire Relay Agent Option SHALL be
   included in all replies by DHCP servers understanding the Relay Agent
   Option.  There is no special additional processing for this
   suboption.


3.0 Security Considerations

   Message authentication in DHCP for intradomain use where the out-of-
   band exchange of a shared secret is feasible is defined in RFC 3118
   [5].  Potential exposures to attack are discussed in section 7 of the
   DHCP protocol specification in RFC 2131 [2].

   The DHCP Relay Agent option depends on a trusted relationship between
   the DHCP relay agent and the server, as described in section 5 of RFC
   3046.  While the introduction of fraudulent relay-agent options can
   be prevented by a perimeter defense that blocks these options unless
   the relay agent is trusted, a deeper defense using the authentication
   option for relay agent options [4] SHOULD be deployed as well.

4.0 IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned a value of TBD for the DHCP Relay Information
   Suboption code described in this document.
