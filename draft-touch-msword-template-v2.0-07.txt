Abstract 

   This document describes the properties and use of a revised Microsoft 
   Word template (.dot) for writing Internet Drafts and RFCs. It updates 
   the initial template described in RFC 3285 to more fully support 
   Word's outline modes and to be easier to use. This template can be 
   direct-printed and direct-viewed, where either is line-for-line 
   identical with RFC Editor-compliant ASCII output. This version is 
   intended as an update to RFC3285.

1. Introduction 

   Internet Drafts and RFCs are predominantly written in embedded-text 
   compile-based formatting systems [1][4][5]. The primary and first 
   such system is NROFF, a text formatting utility based on manual entry 
   of embedded configuration commands, such as ".p" for new paragraphs.

Internet-Draft   Version 2.0 Microsoft Word Template          July 2008 
    

   XML is a more recent alternative that uses structure tags instead of 
   explicit formatting commands to allow a single file (.xml) to be 
   'compiled' into ASCII output, HTML, or a variety of other formats as 
   desired [7]. 

   Although XML adds more modern semantic information to the structure 
   tags, neither system supports modern WYSIWYG (what you see is what 
   you get) editing. Editors such as Microsoft Word and Corel 
   WordPerfect, provide not only WYSIWYG editing, but also semantic tags 
   as well as outline-mode capabilities. To that end, a Word template 
   called 2-Word.template.rtf was created that supports authoring RFCs, 
   as described in RFC-3285 [6]. That version succeeded in enabling 
   Word-based RFC editing, but did not support Word's outline mode 
   renumbering capabilities.   

   This document describes the properties and use of a revised Microsoft 
   Word template (.dot) file that supports Internet Draft and RFC 
   formatting, intended as an update to that of RFC-3285. This version, 
   called 2-Word-v2.0.template.dot, addresses a number of issues with 
   the preliminary version: 

   o  redefines basic styles (Normal, Heading1, etc.) rather than 
      creating new styles 

   o  updates boilerplate according to BCP 78 

   o  uses more conventional methods for autonumbered references and 
      figures, including support for name-based references (e.g., 
      "[Tou2005]") 

   o  supports direct output to a printer from the .doc source, as well 
      as RFC-3285-style 'print to text' with post-processing on Windows-
      based PCs 

   This document assumes familiarity with Microsoft Windows operating 
   systems and the Word application. 

2. Use 

   To use this template, double-click on it in Windows (it may work in 
   MacOS and/or OpenOffice, but this has not been confirmed). The result 
   should be a 'new' document. Do NOT open this document from within 
   Word, e.g., via the File->Open menu; this will edit the template, 
   rather than using the template to create a new template-based 
   document.

Internet-Draft   Version 2.0 Microsoft Word Template          July 2008 
    

2.1. Setting up your version of Word to edit RFCs 

   Unfortunately, Word does not have a way to save some useful settings 
   in a template. It may be useful to configure autoformatting to avoid 
   using smart quotes or hyphens. This template is compatible with these 
   features, however, as its post-processor script translates these non-
   standard character codes to their RFC-compatible ASCII equivalents. 

2.2. Editing 

   The template provides a number of styles for use (for details, see 
   APPENDIX A: ). Some are redefined internal styles, and some are new, 
   as follow. Throughout the document, avoid the use of bold, italics, 
   or any other character formatting, as well as any graphics, or 
   paragraph or table borders. Smart hyphens and quotes need not be 
   avoided, and will be translated during post-processing. 

   The current styles allow existing hyphens to break (wrap) across 
   lines, but do not add hyphenation. To insert a non-breaking hyphen, 
   type <CTL-_> (control-underscore); this is particularly useful in 
   URLs, which are more readable if not line-wrapped. 

   Note that it is critical NOT to use any styles other than those 
   provided by this template. 

   o  Redefined internal styles for general use:  

      Normal, Heading1-9, Caption, Header, Footer: 

         Use in the normal fashion. Tabs can be used as desired.

Internet-Draft   Version 2.0 Microsoft Word Template          July 2008 
    

   o  New styles: 

      RFC Title:  

         For the document title only 

      RFC Figure:  

         For ASCII-art figures. single spaced, kept-together 

      RFC List Bullet:  

         For bulleted-lists 

      RFC List Numbered:  

         For numbered-lists. use 'restart numbering' as desired for new 
         list sequences 

      RFC References: 

         For normative and informative references. Do not restart 
         numbering for informative references. 

         NOTE: references can use an alternate unnumbered style which 
         relies on use of Word's bookmark feature to set cross-reference 
         tags. 

      RFC App: 

         For appendix titles, using "APPENDIX A: " format. Starts at the 
         top of a new page. If appendices are used, start the references 
         (after appendices) at the top of a new page (insert 'page 
         break') 

      RFC App H1-5: 

         For appendix headings ("A.1. " format). NOTE: these headings 
         will NOT auto-renumber when promoted/demoted in outline mode. 

   o  Redefined styles used internal to the doc, but not generally 
      accessed by users: 

      TOC1-9: 

         For table of contents entries.

Internet-Draft   Version 2.0 Microsoft Word Template          July 2008 
    

      RFC Instructions: 

         For instructions to authors. These notes must be deleted. 

      RFC H1 - no num: 

         For unnumbered headings in end boilerplate text. 

      RFC H1 - no TOC no num: 

         For unnumbered, unlisted (in TOC) headings in front boilerplate 
         text. 

2.3. Saving the File 

   The template is provided as a Word 97-2003 ".dot" template; Word 2007 
   uses an XML-based variant called ".dotx". Word 2007 can use ".dot" 
   templates in "Compatibility Mode". If the file is saved in that mode, 
   it has a ".doc" suffix; if saved in native Word 2007 mode, it has a 
   ".docx" format. It does not matter which saved file format is used. 

2.4. Generating Output 

   This template supports printing similar output to both regular 
   printers (8.5x11" paper) and as Internet-Draft/RFC compatible text 
   files. Printing to a printer is designed for Windows XP and Vista and 
   may work with earlier versions of Windows; it has not been tested 
   with other OS's. The template is currently in a Word 97-2003 format 
   (.dot); this can be used in "Compatibility Mode" in Word 2007. 

   Printing to text is supported only for Windows at this time. There is 
   no current support for XML. Details are provided as follows. 

2.4.1. Printing Direct to a Printer 

   The template produces output direct to a printer that is line-for-
   line, page-for-page identical with the text-only version, with a few 
   minor exceptions: 

   o  Single and double quotes may be angled (left quote, right quote), 
      rather than straight, depending on whether 'smart quotes' are 
      enabled in Tools->Autocorrect options. 

   o  Hyphens may print as an EM-dash or EN-dash, depending on whether 
      'smart hyphens' are enabled in Tools->Autocorrect options.

Internet-Draft   Version 2.0 Microsoft Word Template          July 2008 
    

2.4.2. Printing the Text File 

   Printing to an ASCII text file is currently known to work only on 
   Windows-XP and Windows-Vista PCs; appropriate ASCII-output drivers 
   for MacOS or Unix boxes running OpenOffice are not currently known. 

   To generate .txt output on a Windows-XP or Windows Vista PC, use a 
   two-step process. First, generate a .prn file by printing the 
   document to text-only printer. Second, apply post-processing to clean 
   up the text and apply 'new page' characters. 

   Install the "Generic/Text Only" printer, as found in under "Generic" 
   in the available print drivers list. Configure the printer to save to 
   a file, or click 'save to file' when printing. A printed file will 
   have a .prn file suffix. 

   The printed output needs to be run through a post-processor to 
   generate valid Internet-Draft or RFC formatted text. Run the .prn 
   file through the post-processing as described in APPENDIX B: . This 
   includes: 

   o  Omit <CR>s (converts <CR><LF> to <LF> as well as omitting bare 
      <CR>s) 

   o  Convert smart quotes and hyphens to their ASCII counterparts 

   o  Omits blank lines between the footer of one page and the header of 
      the next, and inserts a <CTL-L> (form-feed) between the two. 

   o  Checks for remaining illegal characters (not printable ASCII, CR, 
      LF), as required 

2.4.3. XML Support 

   There is no current support for XML in this template. Although Word 
   2003 provides XML support, its use is counterintuitive to most Word 
   users. XML fields are edited using a separate database editor, rather 
   than in the native Word input screen. Future support for XML is being 
   considered for a future revision of this template. 

3. Changes from RFC 3285 

   This document and the ".dot" template borrow heavily from RFC 3285 
   [6]. Notably, all specifics of point sizes, tab locations, and the 
   automatic date fields are directly from that template. This document 
   builds on that information as follows.

Internet-Draft   Version 2.0 Microsoft Word Template          July 2008 
    

3.1. Heading Styles 

   This document redefines Normal, Heading1-9, Header, Footer, and 
   Caption, rather than defining new RFC-named styles as in RFC 3285. 
   The use of internal style names is required for proper operation of 
   outline mode, notably when promoting/demoting sections of text with 
   subsequent renumbering of headings therein. 

   Note that this use of redefined standard styles is the common 
   practice, both in Microsoft-supplied templates as well as templates 
   from the IEEE and ACM, among others.  

   Additional heading styles RFC App and RFC App H1-9 were added to 
   support alternate numbering used in appendices, although these styles 
   exhibit the previous deficiency of custom styles in outline mode 
   (will not auto-renumber on promote/demote). 

3.2. References Style 

   There are two different reference styles - RFC References, and RFC 
   References Bookmark. The former cross-references using numbers (e.g., 
   [1]), the latter is uses Word's bookmarking cross-reference features 
   to support name/year cross-references (e.g., [Tou2005]). The latter 
   is expected to be the preferred format for future IDs and RFCs. 

   RFC References is a body text paragraph style that autonumbers based 
   on the "[1]" format. Again, it is common practice, both among 
   Microsoft-supplied templates as well as templates from the IEEE and 
   ACM, to use autonumbered paragraphs in the body text for references. 
   This differs from RFC 3285, in which references were inserted as 
   endnotes, rather than as main body text. 

   Putting references in endnotes has unexpected behavior. In 
   particular, the reference is defined by its first use as a citation, 
   and cross-referenced by subsequence citations. Removing the first 
   citation removes the reference entirely, despite other cross-
   references. This is not the case with body text autonumbered 
   paragraphs, which persist regardless of which cross-references are 
   deleted.  

   Note that Word does not provide a way to ensure that all RFC 
   Reference paragraphs are cross-referenced, i.e., users can insert 
   references which are not cited. This can be desired, however, e.g., 
   for bibliographies of supplemental material. 

   RFC References Bookmark is a body text paragraph style that does not 
   use autonumbering. Currently, authors are expected to manually format 
 
 
Touch                  Expires January 8, 2009                 [Page 8] 

Internet-Draft   Version 2.0 Microsoft Word Template          July 2008 
    

   their references using name-based tags between square brackets 
   ("[]"). There is no required format, but a suggested format would use 
   the first three letters of the first author, together with the four 
   numbers of the document year, e.g., for this document's reference 
   "[2]", the reference would now appear as: 

   [Bra2004]   Bradner, S., "IETF Rights... 

   The author is expected to select the text of the reference 
   "[Bra2004]" and Insert a Bookmark at that point with whatever name is 
   convenient for the author. It can then be cited as usual as a cross-
   reference to the bookmark: [Bra2004] Note that Word bookmark names 
   must start with a letter, and may include numbers but not spaces. 

   When two references collide, e.g., for two papers written by Bradner 
   in 2004, a trailing lowercase letter should be used to distinguish 
   them, e.g., [Bra2004a] and [Bra2004b]. 

3.3. Boilerplate 

   The boilerplate in this template was updated to conform with current 
   RFC Editor requirements, notably BCP 78 rights statements, as well as 
   pending guidelines for Internet Draft and RFC authors [2][3][5]. 

   The boilerplate is written in regular text, and can be easily edited 
   by authors to keep the template up-to-date as BCP 78 is revised. 

3.4. Simplification 

   Headers and footers use more conventional tabbing to control 
   formatting, rather than tables. 

   Users no longer need to avoid the use of smart quotes or hyphens; 
   these are automatically translated to RFC-compliant ASCII characters 
   during post-processing. 

   A number of styles include grouping configuration, designed to 
   provide more readable output. In particular, all headings are "keep 
   with next" to avoid widowed heading lines, and all list items, 
   references, and figure lines are "keep together", to avoid in 
   advertent splitting across page boundaries. 

3.5. Ability to direct print and direct view 

   This template can print directly to a printer, generating output 
   which is line-for-line, page-for-page identical with the compliant 
   ASCII text output, excepting minor formatting of hyphens and quotes.

Internet-Draft   Version 2.0 Microsoft Word Template          July 2008 
    

   Further, this template can be previewed in File->Print Preview or 
   View->Print Layout, again generating screen images which are line-
   for-line, page-for-page identical with the compliant ASCII text 
   output. This allows true "WYSIWYG" (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) 
   editing and printing. 

4. Compatibility Issues 

   There are no known compatibility issues at this time. This version of 
   the template was designed under Windows XP and Word 2002, and has 
   also been tested under Windows Vista and Word 2007. It is not yet 
   known whether previous versions of Windows/Word are supported using 
   this template. 

   As noted in Sec. 3.1, this template redefines predefined styles, 
   which is common practice. 

5. Security Considerations 

   There are many security issues in the general use of Microsoft 
   operating systems and applications. This template is not known to 
   expose any new security issues; it contains no macros as developed 
   and deployed. The author considered including the MD5 signatures of 
   the current versions of the .dot template and .pl post-processor 
   files. The current processor .pl file is included in this document as 
   an appendix. The .dot file is updated to track the current 
   requirements of the IETF boilerplate, so its MD5 signature cannot be 
   included here, but is posted on our website for verification. 

6. IANA Considerations 

   There are no IANA issues in this document. 

   The RFC Editor may remove this section prior to publication. 

7. Acknowledgments 

   The author acknowledges the substantial efforts of the previous 
   version of the Word template, Mike Gahrns and Tony Hain [6]. This 
   document is intended to build upon their work. Thanks also to Lars-
   Erik Jonsson for feedback on this template and post-processor script, 
   as well as suggestions on making it more generic to support earlier 
   versions of Windows, and Jixiong Dong for finding an obscure bug in 
   the formatting. 

   This document was prepared using 2-Word-v2.0.template.dot.

Internet-Draft   Version 2.0 Microsoft Word Template          July 2008 
    

APPENDIX A: Template configuration details 

   The Word 97-2003 ".dot" template, compatible with Word 2007, consists 
   of a set of default configuration settings, a set of modified and 
   newly-defined styles, and an initial template of text. This section 
   in particular assumes familiarity with Microsoft Word configuration 
   and modification of styles. Note that use of the template does not 
   require understanding this section; this merely documents the 
   settings already in the ".dot" file. 

A.1. Configure  

A.2. Configure styles 

   Modify paragraph styles as indicated. In general use, only the 
   redefined existing styles Normal, Heading1-9, Header, Footer, and 
   Caption, and new styles RFC Figure, RFC References, RFC List Bullet, 
   RFC List Numbered, RFC App, and RFC App H1-5 need be used by authors. 

   Other styles, such as redefined TOC1-9, RFC Hidden, RFC H1 - no num, 
   and RFC H1 - no TOC no num are used by the template, but are 
   typically hidden in the styles list, and need not be explicitly 
   applied by authors. 

   All measurement units below are in points. Change measurement units 
   to points to set. 

A.2.1. Redefine existing styles 

   Redefine the Normal style first; all others are based on Normal 
   except as noted. 

   1. Normal: font Courier New, font size 12 point, next style Normal, 
      line spacing EXACTLY 12 point, spacing before 0 pt, spacing after 
      12 pt, indent left 21.6 pts, widow/orphan control, left tabs at 
      every 3 spaces (1 space = 7.2 points, given 72 points/inch and 10 
      characters/inch): 21.6, 43.2, 64.8, 86.4, 108, 129.6, 151.2,172.8, 
      194.4, 216, 237.6, 259.2, 280.8, 302.4, 324, 345.6,367.2, 388.8, 
      410.4, 432, 453.6, 475.2, 496.8 

      (Note: 12 point fonts are 12 points tall, i.e., 6 lines/inch 
      vertically; 12-point Courier is 10 characters/inch horizontally)

Internet-Draft   Version 2.0 Microsoft Word Template          July 2008 
    

   2. Heading 1-9: Normal + indent left 0 pt, hanging 21.6 pts, keep 
      with next, set autonumbering as "1. ", "1.1. ", "1.1.1. ", etc. 
      Note the space after the right-most period; type this in the 
      number format field, and leave the "follow number with" field as 
      'nothing' (click on the 'more' button to see this field if it is 
      not already visible). 

      NOTES: change the autonumbering ONCE, in ONE format, and in that 
      format change all subsequent levels.  

   3. TOC 1-9: Normal + paragraph flush, clear tabs, add new Right tab 
      at 504 pts that includes a "..." leader. Add indent left as 
      follows: TOC 1: 21.6, TOC 2: 43.2, TOC 3: 64.8, TOC 4: 86.4, TOC 
      5: 108, TOC 6: 129.6, TOC 7: 151.2, TOC 8: 172.8, TOC 9: 194.4

      and add centered tab at 252 pts, tab right at 504 pts 

   5. Footer: Header + next style Footer 

   6. Caption: Normal + centered, autonumbered "Figure #" 

A.2.2. Add new styles 

   Note: "keep lines together" is optional for lists and references; it 
   helps avoid breaking individual items across pages. 

   1. RFC Figure: Normal + space after 0 pts, keep with next, keep lines 
      together, next style RFC figure (also used for authors' addresses) 

   2. RFC List Bullet - Normal + custom bulleted, "o" bullet style, 
      aligned at 21.6 pts, bullet tab after 43.2 pts, bullet indent at 
      43.2 pts, next style RFC List Bullet, keep lines together 

   3. RFC List Numbered - Normal + custom numbered, "1. " number format, 
      aligned at 21.6 pts, bullet tab after 43.2 pts, bullet indent at 
      43.2 pts, next style RFC List Numbered, keep lines together  

   4. RFC References: Normal + hanging 43.2 pts, outline level body 
      text, remove tabs at 21.6 and 43.2 pts, custom numbering with 
      format "[1]", numbering left aligned 21.6 pts, number tab space 
      after at 64.8 pts, number text indent at 64.8 pts, next style RFC 
      References, keep lines together (used for both normative and

   5. RFC References Bookmark: Normal + hanging 72 pts, no num, remove 
      tabs less than 72 pts, keep lines together (used for both 
      normative and informational references) 

   6. RFC Title: Normal + space after 24 pts, centered (used for 
      document title) 

   7. RFC App: RFC H1 - no num + page break before, custom outline 
      numbered, outline number style "APPENDIX A: ", outline level 1, 
      follow number with nothing, outline number at 0 pts, outline 
      indent text at 0 pts, (used for Appendix titles) 

   8. RFC App H1-5: RFC H1 - no num + paragraph level 2-6, custom 
      outline numbered, outline number style "A.1. " - "A.1.1.1.1.1. ", 
      follow number with nothing, outline number at 0 pts, outline 
      indent text at 0 pts, (link with RFC App at level 2-6), (used for 
      Appendix heading levels) 

A.2.3. Hidden styles: 

   These are used for pre-formatted components or instructions, and are 
   configured to be hidden from the list of available styles. 

   1. RFC H1 - no num: Normal + indent left 0 pts, outline Level 1, keep 
      with next (used for base template trailer headers - Copyright, 
      Acknowledgement, etc.) 

   2. RFC H1 - no TOC nonum: Normal + indent left 0 pts, (outline level 
      body text, as with Normal), keep with next (used for base template 
      front matter headers - Abstract, Status, TOC header, etc.) 

   3. RFC Instructions: Normal, character bold. This style is not 
      normally shown, and is used for instructions which should be 
      removed before publication. 

A.3. Define page layout 

   Configure Page Setup as follows: 

   4. Margins: 

      Portrait orientation. 

         Top:    72   pts 
         Bottom: 60   pts (72 + 60 +_660 [55 lines] = 792 [11 in]) 
         Left:   36   pts (5 characters at 7.2 pts/char) 
         Right:  57.6 pts (8.5"-7.2" = 1.3in = 93.6 pts - 36 for left)

   that some of these fields will not be updated properly until the 
   document has been saved and/or printed. 

   Basic document outline with examples are provided to demonstrate 
   their use, including a table of contents. 

A.5. Automatic fields 

   Most of these are self-explanatory; the expiry month is set 6 months 
   in advance. The expiry year rolls-over (+1) if needed. The expiry day 
   is a copy of the current date. 

   NOTE: expiry date can generate invalid dates, e.g., April 31, 
   Februrary 30, etc.
