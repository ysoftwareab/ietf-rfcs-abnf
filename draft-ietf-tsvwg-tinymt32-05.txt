             TinyMT32 Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG)
                      draft-ietf-tsvwg-tinymt32-05

Abstract

   This document describes the TinyMT32 Pseudo Random Number Generator
   (PRNG) that produces 32-bit pseudo-random unsigned integers and aims
   at having a simple-to-use and deterministic solution.  This PRNG is a
   small-sized variant of Mersenne Twister (MT) PRNG.  The main
   advantage of TinyMT32 over MT is the use of a small internal state,
   compatible with most target platforms that include embedded devices,
   while keeping a reasonably good randomness that represents a
   sigificant improvement compared to the Park-Miller Linear
   Congruential PRNG.  However, neither the TinyMT nor MT PRNG are meant
   to be used for cryptographic applications.

1.  Introduction

   This document specifies the TinyMT32 PRNG, as a specialization of the
   reference implementation version 1.1 (2015/04/24) by Mutsuo Saito and
   Makoto Matsumoto, from Hiroshima University, that can be found at
   [TinyMT-web] (TinyMT web site) and [TinyMT-dev] (Github site).  This
   specialisation aims at having a simple-to-use and deterministic PRNG,
   as explained below.  However, the TinyMT32 PRNG is not meant to be
   used for cryptographic applications.

   TinyMT is a new small-sized variant introduced in 2011 of the
   Mersenne Twister (MT) PRNG [MT98].  This document focusses on the
   TinyMT32 variant (rather than TinyMT64) of the TinyMT PRNG, which
   outputs 32-bit unsigned integers.

   The purpose of TinyMT is not to replace Mersenne Twister: TinyMT has
   a far shorter period (2^^127 - 1) than MT.  The merit of TinyMT is in
   the small size of the internal state of 127 bits, far smaller than
   the 19937 bits of MT.  The outputs of TinyMT satisfy several
   statistical tests for non-cryptographic randomness, including
   BigCrush in TestU01 [TestU01] and AdaptiveCrush [AdaptiveCrush],

   leaving it well-placed for non-cryptographic usage, especially given
   the small size of its internal state (see [TinyMT-web]).  From this
   point of view, TinyMT32 represents a major improvement with respect
   to the Park-Miller Linear Congruential PRNG (e.g., as specified in
   [RFC5170]) that suffers several known limitations (see for instance
   [PTVF92], section 7.1, p. 279, and [RLC-ID], Appendix B).

   The TinyMT32 PRNG initialization depends, among other things, on a
   parameter set, namely (mat1, mat2, tmat).  In order to facilitate the
   use of this PRNG and make the sequence of pseudo-random numbers
   depend only on the seed value, this specification requires the use of
   a specific parameter set (see Section 3.1).  This is a major
   difference with respect to the implementation version 1.1
   (2015/04/24) that leaves this parameter set unspecified.

   Finally, the determinism of this PRNG, for a given seed, has been
   carefully checked (see Section 3.3).  It means that the same sequence
   of pseudo-random numbers should be generated, no matter the target
   execution platform and compiler, for a given initial seed value.
   This determinism can be a key requirement as it the case with
   [RLC-ID] that normatively depends on this specification.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and

   capitals, as shown here.

3.  TinyMT32 PRNG Specification

3.1.  TinyMT32 Source Code

   The TinyMT32 PRNG requires to be initialized with a parameter set
   that needs to be well chosen.  In this specification, for the sake of
   simplicity, the following parameter set MUST be used:

   o  mat1 = 0x8f7011ee = 2406486510
   o  mat2 = 0xfc78ff1f = 4235788063
   o  tmat = 0x3793fdff = 932445695

   This parameter set is the first entry of the precalculated parameter
   sets in file tinymt32dc/tinymt32dc.0.1048576.txt, by Kenji Rikitake,
   and available at [TinyMT-params].  This is also the parameter set
   used in [KR12].

   The TinyMT32 PRNG reference implementation is reproduced in Figure 1.
   This is a C language implementation, written for C99 [C99].  This
   reference implementation differs from the original source code as
   follows:

   o  the original copyright and license have been removed by the
      original authors who are now authors of this document, in
      accordance with BCP 78 and the IETF Trust's Legal Provisions
      Relating to IETF Documents (http://trustee.ietf.org/license-info);
   o  the source code initially spread over the tinymt32.h and
      tinymt32.c files has been merged;
   o  the unused parts of the original source code have been removed.
      This is the case of the tinymt32_init_by_array() alternative
      initialisation function.  This is also the case of the
      period_certification() function after having checked it is not
      required with the chosen parameter set;
   o  the unused constants TINYMT32_MEXP and TINYMT32_MUL have been
      removed;
   o  the appropriate parameter set has been added to the initialization
      function;
   o  the function order has been changed;
   o  certain internal variables have been renamed for compactness
      purposes;
   o  the const qualifier has been added to the constant definitions;
   o  the code that was dependant on the representation of negative
      integers by 2's complements has been replaced by a more portable
      version;

3.2.  TinyMT32 Usage

   This PRNG MUST first be initialized with the following function:

      void tinymt32_init (tinymt32_t* s, uint32_t seed);

   It takes as input a 32-bit unsigned integer used as a seed (note that
   value 0 is permitted by TinyMT32).  This function also takes as input

   a pointer to an instance of a tinymt32_t structure that needs to be
   allocated by the caller but left uninitialized.  This structure will
   then be updated by the various TinyMT32 functions in order to keep
   the internal state of the PRNG.  The use of this structure admits
   several instances of this PRNG to be used in parallel, each of them
   having its own instance of the structure.

   Then, each time a new 32-bit pseudo-random unsigned integer between 0
   and 2^32 - 1 inclusive is needed, the following function is used:

      uint32_t tinymt32_generate_uint32 (tinymt32_t * s);

   Of course, the tinymt32_t structure must be left unchanged by the
   caller between successive calls to this function.

3.3.  Specific Implementation Validation and Deterministic Behavior

   PRNG determinism, for a given seed, can be a requirement (e.g., with
   [RLC-ID]).  Consequently, any implementation of the TinyMT32 PRNG in
   line with this specification MUST have the same output as that
   provided by the reference implementation of Figure 1.  In order to
   increase the compliancy confidence, this document proposes the
   following criteria.  Using a seed value of 1, the first 50 values
   returned by tinymt32_generate_uint32(s) as 32-bit unsigned integers
   are equal to values provided in Figure 2, to be read line by line.
   Note that these values come from the tinymt/check32.out.txt file
   provided by the PRNG authors to validate implementations of TinyMT32,
   as part of the MersenneTwister-Lab/TinyMT Github repository.

   In particular, the deterministic behavior of the Figure 1 source code
   has been checked across several platforms: high-end laptops running
   64-bits Mac OSX and Linux/Ubuntu; a board featuring a 32-bits ARM
   Cortex-A15 and running 32-bit Linux/Ubuntu; several embedded cards

   featuring either an ARM Cortex-M0+, a Cortex-M3 or a Cortex-M4 32-bit
   microcontroller, all of them running RIOT [Baccelli18]; two low-end
   embedded cards featuring either a 16-bit microcontroller (TI MSP430)
   or a 8-bit microcontroller (Arduino ATMEGA2560), both of them running
   RIOT.

   This specification only outputs 32-bit unsigned pseudo-random numbers
   and does not try to map this output to a smaller integer range (e.g.,
   between 10 and 49 inclusive).  If a specific use-case needs such a
   mapping, it will have to provide its own function.  In that case, if
   PRNG determinism is also required, the use of floating point (single
   or double precision) to perform this mapping should probably be
   avoided, these calculations leading potentially to different rounding
   errors across different target platforms.  Great care should also be
   put on not introducing biases in the randomness of the mapped output
   (it may be the case with some mapping algorithms) incompatible with
   the use-case requirements.  The details of how to perform such a
   mapping are out-of-scope of this document.

4.  Security Considerations

   The authors do not believe the present specification generates
   specific security risks per se.  However, neither the TinyMT nor MT
   PRNG are meant to be used for cryptographic applications.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any IANA action.

6.  Acknowledgments

   The authors would like to thank Belkacem Teibi with whom we explored
   TinyMT32 specificities when looking to an alternative to the Park-
   Miller Linear Congruential PRNG.  The authors would like to thank
   Carl Wallace, Stewart Bryant, Greg Skinner, Mike Heard, the three
   TSVWG chairs, Wesley Eddy, our shepherd, David Black and Gorry
   Fairhurst, as well as Spencer Dawkins and Mirja Kuhlewind.  Last but
   not least, the authors are really grateful to the IESG members, in
   particular Benjamin Kaduk, Eric Rescorla, Adam Roach, Roman Danyliw,
   Barry Leiba, Martin Vigoureux, Eric Vyncke for their highly valuable
   feedbacks that greatly contributed to improve this specification.
