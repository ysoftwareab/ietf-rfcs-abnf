Internet-Draft               ARP IANA Rules                February 2009


Abstract

   This document specifies the IANA guidelines for allocating new values
   in the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP).  This document also
   reserves some numbers for experimentation purposes.  The changes also
   affect other protocols that employ values from the ARP name spaces.


1.  Introduction

   This document specifies the IANA guidelines [RFC5226] for allocating
   new values for various fields in the Address Resolution Protocol
   (ARP) [RFC0826].  The change is also applicable to extensions of ARP
   that use the same message format, such as [RFC0903], [RFC1931], and
   [RFC2390].

   The change also affects other protocols that employ values from the
   ARP name spaces.  For instance, the ARP hardware address type
   (ar$hrd) number space is also used in the "htype" (hardware address
   type) fields in Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) [RFC0951] and Dynamic Host
   Configuration Protocol (DHCP) [RFC2131], as well as in the "hardware
   type" field in the DHCP Unique Identifiers in DHCPv6 [RFC3315].
   These protocols are therefore affected by the update in the IANA
   rules.  Other affected specifications include the specialized address
   resolution mechanisms in HYPERchannel [RFC1044], DHCP options
   [RFC2132], [RFC4361], ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) ARP [RFC2225],
   HARP (High-Performance Parallel Interface ARP) [RFC2834], [RFC2835],
   Dual MAC FDDI (Fiber Distributed Data Interface) ARP [RFC1329], MAPOS
   (Multiple Access Protocol over Synchronous Optical Network/
   Synchronous Digital Hierarchy) ARP [RFC2176], FC (Fibre Channel) ARP
   [RFC4338], and the DNS DHCID Resource Record [RFC4701].

   The IANA guidelines are given in Section 2.  Previously, no IANA
   guidance existed for such allocations.  The purpose of this document
   is to allow IANA to manage number assignments based on these
   guidelines in a consistent manner.

   This document also reserves some numbers for experimentation
   purposes.  These numbers are given in Section 3.


2.  IANA Considerations

   The following rules apply to the fields of ARP:

Internet-Draft               ARP IANA Rules                February 2009


   ar$hrd (16 bits) Hardware address space

      Requests for ar$hrd values below 256 or a batch of more than one
      new value are made through Expert Review [RFC5226].

      Note that certain protocols, such as BOOTP and DHCPv4 employ these
      values within a 8 bit field.  The expert should determine that the
      need to allocate the new values exists and that the existing
      values are insufficient to represent the new hardware address
      types.  The expert should also determine the applicability of the
      request, and assign values higher than 255 for requests that do
      not apply to BOOTP/DHCPv4.  Similarly, the expert should assign
      one-octet values for requests that apply to BOOTP/DHCPv4, as for
      example the "IPsec tunnel" with value 31 [RFC3456].  Conversely,
      ARP-only uses without a foreseeable reason to use the same value
      in BOOTP/DHCPv4 should favor 2-octet values.

      Requests for individual new ar$hrd values that do not specify a
      value, or where the requested value is greater than 255, are made
      through First Come First Served [RFC5226].  The assignment will
      always result in a 2-octet value.

   ar$pro (16 bits) Protocol address space

      These numbers share the Ethertype space.  The Ethertype space is
      administered as described in [RFC5342].

   ar$op (16 bits) Opcode

      Requests for new ar$op values are made through IETF Review or IESG
      Approval [RFC5226].

   Upon the approval of this specification, IANA should update all three
   registration policies listed in arp-parameters registry as specified
   in the above list, and add a reference to either this RFC or RFC
   5342, as appropriate.  RFC Editor: This paragraph can be removed upon
   publication.


3.  Allocations Defined in This Document

   When testing new protocol extension ideas, it is often necessary to
   use an actual constant in order to use the new function, even when
   testing in a closed environment.  This document reserves the
   following numbers for experimentation purposes in ARP:

   o  Two new ar$hrd values are allocated for experimental purposes,
      HW_EXP1 (TBD-BY-IANA-1, but below 256) and HW_EXP2 (TBD-BY-IANA-2,

      but above 255 and preferably with different values in the least
      and most significant octets).

   o  Two new values for the ar$op are allocated for experimental
      purposes, OP_EXP1 (TBD-BY-IANA-3, any value will be sufficient)
      and OP_EXP2 (TBD-BY-IANA-4, any value will be sufficient).

   Note that [RFC5342], Section B.2 lists two Ethertypes that can be
   used for experimental purposes.

   In addition, for both ar$hrd and ar$op the values 0 and 65535 are
   marked as reserved.  This means that they are not available for
   allocation.

   Upon the approval of this specification, IANA should add the two new
   allocations and two reserved values for both ar$hrd and ar$op to the
   arp-parameters registry, and reference this RFC.  RFC Editor: This
   paragraph can be removed upon publication.


4.  Security Considerations

   This specification does not change the security properties of the
   affected protocols.

   However, a few words are necessary about the use of the experimental
   code points defined in Section 3.  Potentially harmful side-effects
   from the use of the experimental values needs to be carefully
   evaluated before deploying any experiment across networks that the
   owner of the experiment does not entirely control.  Guidance given in
   [RFC3692] about the use of experimental values needs to be followed.


5.  Acknowledgments

   The lack of any current rules has come up as new values were
   requested from IANA and they contacted IESG for advice.  The author
   would like to thank Michelle Cotton in particular for bringing this
   issue up.  The author would also like to thank Brian Carpenter,
   Thomas Narten, Scott Bradner, Donald Eastlake, Andrew G. Malis, Brian
   Haberman, Robert Sparks, Larry Zhu, and Dave Thaler for feedback.

Appendix A.  Changes from the Original RFCs

   This document specifies only the IANA rules associated with various
   fields in ARP.  The specification of these rules also affects the
   allocation of corresponding fields in protocols listed in Section 1
   that share the registry.  This document does not make any changes in
   the operation of these protocols themselves.
