Abstract


   The Control and maintenance protocol for providing various Layer 1
   and Layer 2 services over a Packet Switched Network has been
   described in [1]. This document pre-allocates the fixed Pseudo-wire
   identifier , and other fixed protocol values that are to be assigned
   by IANA using the "IETF Consensus" policy defined in RFC2434

1. Specification of Requirements


   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119



2. PW type


   As specified in [1], a Virtual Circuit FEC element contains the PW
   Type field. PW Type value 0 is reserved. PW Type values 1 through 24
   are defined in this document. PW Type values 25 through 63 are to be
   assigned by IANA using the "IETF Consensus" policy defined in
   RFC2434. PW Type values 64 through 127 are to be assigned by IANA,
   using the "First Come First Served" policy defined in RFC2434. VC
   Type values 128 through 32767 are vendor-specific, and values in this
   range are not to be assigned by IANA.


   The PW Type is 15 bit quantity containing a value which represents
   the type of PW. Assigned Values are:


      PW type  Description


      0x0001   Frame Relay DLCI
      0x0002   ATM AAL5 SDU VCC transport
      0x0003   ATM transparent cell transport

      0x0017   CESoPSN TDM with CAS
      0x0018   TDMoIP TDM with CAS


   Note 1: This PW type is grandfathered for a historical protocol.  The
   recommended standards-track protocol to use is CEP (PW type 0x0010).



3. Interface Parameters field


   As specified in [1], a PW FEC element contains the Interface
   Parameters field, which is a list of one or more parameters, and each
   parameter is identified by the Parameter ID field. Parameter ID value
   0 is reserved.  Parameter ID values 1 through 11 are defined in this
   document. Parameter ID values 12 through 63 are to be assigned by
   IANA using the "IETF Consensus" policy defined in RFC2434. Parameter
   ID values 64 through 127 are to be assigned by IANA, using the "First
   Come First Served" policy defined in RFC2434. Parameter ID values 128
   through 255 are vendor- specific, and values in this range are not to
   be assigned by IANA.


   The interface parameter ID is assigned as follows:
   Parameter ID  Length    Description


      0x01         4       Interface MTU in octets
      0x02         4       Maximum Number of concatenated ATM cells
      0x03      up to 82   Optional Interface Description string
      0x04         4       CEP/TDM [2] Payload Bytes
      0x05         4       CEP options
      0x06         4       Requested VLAN ID
      0x07         6       CEP/TDM bit-rate
      0x08         4       Frame-Relay DLCI Length
      0x09         4       Fragmentation indicator
      0x0A         4       FCS retension indicator




Martini & Townsley                                              [Page 3]
Internet Draft   draft-ietf-pwe3-iana-allocation-04.txt       April 2004



      0x0B       4/8/12    TDM options
      0x0C                                                                 4VCCV parameter


   Note that the Length field is defined as the length of the interface
   parameter including the parameter id and length field itself.


4. LDP Status codes


   RFC 3036 has a range of LDP Status Code values which are assigned by
   IANA through an IETF Consensus action. These are in the range
   0x00000000-0x1fffffff. To meet the protocol requirements of [1], the
   following new status codes are defined:


      0x00000024 "Illegal C-Bit"
      0x00000025 "Wrong C-Bit"
      0x00000026 "Incompatible bit-rate"
      0x00000027 "CEP/TDM mis-configuration"
      0x00000028 "PW status"



   RFC 3036 has a range of LTLV type name space values which are assigned by IANA
   through an IETF Consensus action. the following new code is defined :
      TLV type  Description
       0x096A   PW Status TLV



5. Pseudo Wire Status"


   As specified in [1], a new PW status TLV contains a 32 bit field, PW
   status value 0 is reserved to clear all failures. PW Status Bits 0
   through 4 are defined in this document. PW Status Bits 6 through 15
   are to be assigned by IANA using the "IETF Consensus" policy defined
   in RFC2434. PW Status Bits 16 through 23 are to be assigned by IANA,
   using the "First Come First Served" policy defined in RFC2434. PW
   Status Bits 24 through 31 are vendor-specific, and values in this
   range are not to be assigned by IANA.


   PW status is a 4 octet bit field as follows:


      0x00000000 - Pseudo Wire forwarding ( clear all failures )
      0x00000001 - Pseudo Wire Not Forwarding
      0x00000002 - Local Attachement Circuit ( ingress ) Receive Fault
      0x00000004 - Local Attachement Circuit ( egress ) Transmit Fault
      0x00000008 - Local PSN-facing PW ( ingress ) Receive Fault
      0x00000010 - Local PSN-facing PW ( egress ) Transmit Fault

6. Security Considerations


   This document specifies only fixed identifiers, and not the protocols
   used to carry the encapsulated packets across the network.  Each such
   protocol may have its own set of security issues, but those issues
   are not affected by the identifiers specified herein.



7. Intellectual Property Disclaimer


   This document is being submitted for use in IETF standards
   discussions.
