Abstract


   Electronic commerce frequently requires a substantial exchange of
   information in order to complete a purchase or other transaction,
   especially the first time the parties communicate. A standard set of
   hierarchically organized payment related information field names in
   an XML syntax are defined so that this task can be more easily
   automated. This is the second version of an Electronic Commerce
   Modeling Language (ECML) and is intended to meeting the requirements
   of RFC 3505.

INTERNET-DRAFT           ECML v2 Specification                 June 2004



1. Introduction


   Numerous parties are conducting business on the Internet using ad hoc
   fields and forms. The data formats and structure can vary
   considerably from one party to another. Where forms are filled out
   manually, many users find the diversity confusing and the process of
   manually filling in these forms to be tedious and error prone.


   Software tools including electronic wallets can help this situation.
   Such tools can assist in conducting online transactions by storing
   billing, shipping, payment, preference, and similar information and
   using this information to automatically complete the data sets
   required by interactions. For example, software that fills out forms
   has been successfully built into browsers, as proxy servers, as
   helper applications to browsers, as stand-alone applications, as
   browser plug-ins, and as server-based applications. But the
   proliferation of more automated transactions software has been
   hampered by the lack of standards.


   ECML (Electronic Commerce Modeling Language) provides a set of
   hierarchical payment oriented data structures that will enable
   automated software, including electronic wallets, from multiple
   vendors to supply and query for needed data in a more uniform manner.


   Version 2.0 extends ECML Version 1.0 [RFC 2706] and 1.1 [RFC 3106] as
   described in the Appendix to this document. These enhancements
   include support for additional payment mechanisms and transaction
   information and use of XML as the exemplar syntax.


   Likely uses for ECML v2 are consumer payment information input and
   business-to-business transactions. The first is still likely to occur
   through HTML forms. The second is more likely to use XML documents.


   ECML is designed to provide a simple baseline useful in a variety of
   contexts.




1.2 History and Relationship to Other Standards


   The ECML fields were initially derived from the W3C P3P base data
   schema [P3P BASE] by the ECML Alliance as described in [RFC 2706,
   3106]. Technical development and change control of ECML was then
   transferred to the IETF. In version 2, ECML is extended by the fields
   in a W3C P3P Note related to eCommerce [P3P ECOM], by [ISO 8583], and
   other sources. Its primary form is now an XML syntax.

2. Field Definitions and DTD


   The ECML Standard is the definition and naming of a hierarchically
   structured set of fields and the provision of an optional XML syntax
   for their transmission. These fields can also be encoded in other
   syntaxes.  Regardless of the encoding used, they can be transmitted
   via a variety of protocols.


   Section 2.1 below lists and describes the fields and Section 2.2
   provides an XML DTD for use with the fields.


   To conform to this standard, field names must be structured and named
   as closely to the structure and naming listed below as practical
   given the syntax and transaction protocol in use. (NOTE: this does
   not impose any restriction on human visible labeling of fields, just
   on their name or names as used in on-the-wire communication.)




2.1 Field List and Descriptions


   The fields are listed below. along with the minimum data entry size
   to allow. Implementations may accept larger data sizes, where that
   makes sense, and for some applications, will need to allow for larger
   data sizes.


   Note that these fields are hierarchically organized as indicated in
   this table by the embedded underscore ("_") characters. Appropriate
   data transmission mechanisms may use this to request and send
   aggregates, such as Ecom_Payment_Card_ExpDate to encompass all the
   date components or Ecom_ShipTo to encompass all the ship to address
   components that a consumer is willing to provide. The labeling,
   marshalling, unmarshalling of the components of such aggregates
   depends on the data transfer protocol used. The recommended syntax is
   XML as specified in Section 2.2.




2.1.1 The Field List


   The table below is the ECMLv2 field list.


   The NAME column gives the structured string name of each field as
   explained above.  The MIN column below is the minimum data size the
   MUST be allowed for data entry. It is NOT the minimum size for valid
   contents of the field and merchant software should, in most cases, be
   prepared to receive a longer or shorter value. Merchant dealing with
   areas where, for example, the state/province name or phone number is
   longer than the MIN given below must obviously permit longer data
   entry. In some cases, however, there is a maximum size that makes

   sense and where this is the case, it is usually documented in a Note
   for the field.


   The following fields are typically used to communicate from the
   customer to the merchant:

2.1.2 Field Foot Notes


   ( 1) For example: Mr., Mrs., Ms., Dr. This field is commonly not used.


   ( 2) May also be used for middle initial.


   ( 3) For example: Ph.D., Jr. (Junior), 3rd, Esq. (Esquire). This field
        is commonly not used.


   ( 4) Address lines must be filled in the order line1, then line2, and
        last line3. Thus, for example, it is an error for line1 to be null if
        lines2 or line3 is not.


   ( 5) 2 characters are the minimum for the US and Canada,
        other countries may require longer fields.
        For the US use 2 character US Postal state abbreviation.


   ( 6) Minimum field lengths for Postal Code will vary based on
        international market served. Use 5 character or 5+4 ZIP for the US
        and 6 character postal code for Canada. The size given, 14, is
        believed to be the maximum required anywhere in the world.


   ( 7) Use [ISO 3166] standard two letter country codes.


   ( 8) 10 digits are the minimum for numbers within the North American
        Numbering Plan (<http://www.nanpa.com>: US, Canada and a number of
        Caribbean and smaller Pacific nations (but not Cuba)), other countries
        may require longer fields. Telephone numbers are complicated by
        differing international access codes, variant punctuation of area/city
        codes within countries, etc. While it is desirable for telephone
        numbers to be in standard international format [E.164], it may be
        necessary to use heuristics or human examination based on the
        telephone number and addresses given to figure out how to actually
        call a customer since may people will enter local formatted numbers without
        area/access codes. It is recommend that an "x" be placed before

   Meta notes (referenced by other notes):


   (100) ECML, being a basic field naming and structuring convention,
         does not impose any particular requirements on these URLs. It
         is to be expected that most applications that make use of ECML
         will impose limitations and perform checking to be sure that
         provided URLs conform to such limitations before attempting to
         invoke them.


   (101) This is a field which, when presented as a web page, is usually
         hidden.


   (102) ASCII [ASCII] character string with no leading or trailing
         white space.




2.2 ECML v2 XML DTD


   For internationalization of ECML, use the general XML character
   encoding provisions [XML], which mandate support of UTF-8 and UTF-16
   and permit support of other character sets, and the xml:lang
   attribute which may be used to specify language information.

INTERNET-DRAFT           ECML v2 Specification                 June 2004



3. Usage Notes for ECML v2


   This section provides a general usage guide for ECML v2.




3.1 Presentation of the Fields


   This standard merely names fields and specifies their content and
   hierarchical organization. It does not constrain the order or
   completeness of communication of or query for these fields.


   Some parties may wish to provide or ask for more information, some
   less by omitting fields. Some may ask for the information they want
   in one interaction or web page, others may ask for parts of the
   information at different times in multiple interactions or different
   web pages. For example, it is common to ask for "ship to" information
   earlier, so shipping cost can be computed, before the payment method
   information. Some parties may require that all the information they
   request be provided while other make much information optional. Other
   variations are likely.


   Every element may be flagged as a query or assertion by including the
   optional Mode attribute with the value "Query" or "Assert"
   respectively. The Mode attribute effects all descendant elements
   until overridden by a lower level element with a Mode attribute. Thus
   it is early to indicate that all of the elements in an ECML structure
   are present as queries or assertions.


   Query elements may have data content. Such content should be
   interpreted as a default value to be returned if no better value is
   known.


   There is no way with Version 2.0 of ECML to indicate what query
   fields the party considers mandatory. From the point of view of
   software, all fields queried are optional to complete. However, a
   party may give an error or re-present a request for information if
   some field it requires is not completed, just as it may if a field is
   completed in a manner it considers erroneous.




3.2 Methods and Flow of Setting the Fields


   There are a variety of methods of communication possible between the
   parties by which one can indicate what fields it wants the other to
   provide. Probably the easiest method for currently deployed mass
   software is as fields in an [HTML] form. Other possibilities are to
   use an [XML] exchange, the IOTP Authenticate transaction [RFC 2801],
   or proprietary protocols.



D. Eastlake 3rd                                                [Page 18]



INTERNET-DRAFT           ECML v2 Specification                 June 2004



   So that browser software can tell what version it is dealing with, it
   is REQUIRED that the Ecom_SchemaVersion field be included in every
   transactions when ECML is being used on the web. Ecom_SchemaVersion
   SHOULD appear on every web page that has any Ecom fields. It is
   usually a hidden field.


   User action or the appearance of the Ecom_SchemaVersion field are
   examples of triggers that can be used to initiate a facility capable
   of providing information in response to an ECML based query or
   utilizing information from ECML assertions. Because some web software
   may require user activation, it is RECOMMENDED that these be at least
   one user visible Ecom field on every web page with any Ecom fields
   present when ECML is used via the web.


   Because, under some circumstances, communications can proceed very
   slowly, it may not be clear to an automated processing function when
   it is finished receiving ECML fields on a web page or the like. For
   this reason, it is RECOMMENDED that the Ecom_SchemaVersion field be
   the last Ecom field on a web page.


   Transfer or requests for information can extend over several
   interactions or web pages. Without further provision, a facility
   could either require re-starting on each page or possibly violate or
   appear to violate privacy by continuing to provide personal data
   beyond with end of the transaction with a particular business. For
   this reason the Ecom_TransactionComplete field, which is normally
   hidden, is provided. It is RECOMMENDED that it appear on the last
   interaction or web page involved in a transaction, just before an
   Ecom_SchemaVersion field, so that multi-interaction automated logic
   can know when to stop if it chooses to check for this field.




4. Security and Privacy Considerations


   The information called for by many of these fields is sensitive. It
   should be protected from unauthorized modification and kept
   confidential if stored in a location or transmitted over a channel
   where it might otherwise be observed. In addition, the authenticity
   of the information will be a concern in many systems.


   Mechanisms for such protection and authentication are not specified
   herein but might, depending on circumstances, include object security
   protocols, such as XMLDSIG [RFC 3275], XML encryption [XMLENC], or
   CMS [RFC 3369], or channel security such as TLS [RFC 2246] or IPSec
   [RFC 2411]. Systems in which an ECML field or fields are stored and
   later forwarded will likely find object security to be the most
   appropriate.


   When information is being requested from a user, their control over



D. Eastlake 3rd                                                [Page 19]



INTERNET-DRAFT           ECML v2 Specification                 June 2004



   release of such information is needed to protect their privacy.


   Software that is installed on a shared or public terminal should be
   configurable such that memory of any sensitive or individual identity
   information is fully disabled. This is vital to protect the privacy
   of library patrons, students, and customers using public terminals,
   and children who might, for example, use a form on a public terminal
   without realizing that their information is being stored.


   When sensitive or individual identification information is stored,
   the operator or user should have an option to protect the
   information, for example with a password without which the
   information will be unavailable, even to someone who has access to
   the file(s) in which it is being stored.


   Any multi-page/screen or other multi-aggregate field fill in or data
   provision mechanism SHOULD check for the Ecom_TransactionComplete
   field and cease automated fill when it is encountered until fill is
   further authorized.


   It should be remembered that default, hidden, and other values
   transferred to another party may be maliciously modified before being
   returned.




5. IANA Considerations


   The sections below provide for a version URN for ECML Versions,
   provide for the registration of particular versions and register
   Version 2.0, and provide for three additional IANA regitries for
   elements appearing in three ECML v2 fields.




5.1 ECML v2 URN Template


   As specified by the template below from [RFC 3553],
   urn:ietf:params:ecml is permanently registered with sub registration
   via RFC publication.


   Registry name: urn:ietf:params:ecml


   Specification: RFC XXXX - (draft-ietf-trade-ecml2-spec-*.txt)


   Repository: RFC XXXX - (draft-ietf-trade-ecml2-spec-*.txt)


   Index value: Values subordinate to urn:ietf:params:ecml are
      registered by RFC publication. As provided in [RFC 3553], once
      such a value is registered, it may never change.



D. Eastlake 3rd                                                [Page 20]



INTERNET-DRAFT           ECML v2 Specification                 June 2004



5.1.1 Subregistration of v2.0


   The subordinate value "v2.0" is hereby permanently registered so that
   the URN


        urn:ietf:params:ecml:v2.0


   is used to indicate an ECML field or fields that conform to this
   specification. Additional subregistration shall be via IESG approval.




5.2 IANA Registries


   There are three fields describes in Section 2.1.2 that require the
   establishment of IANA registries as described below:


   Ecom_Payment_Card_Type
        A registry of case insensitive alphanumeric ASCII [ASCII] card
        type designations from one to four characters in length with no
        leading or trailing white space. See Section 2.1.2, note 11, for
        the initial 12 designations. Designations are added based on
        expert approval. Applicants for registration will normally be
        required to already have an ISO Issuer Identification Number
        (IIN) or range of IINs.


   Ecom_Payment_Card_Protocol
        This fields holds a space separated list of protocols designated
        by case insensitive alphanumeric ASCII [ASCII] tokens from this
        registry or the token "none".  See Section 2.1.2, note 17, for
        the initial seven registered tokens (including "none") and
        further information. Tokens are added to the registry based on
        expert approval.


   Ecom_Transaction_Type
        A case insensitive alphabetic ASCII [ASCII] value indicating the
        type of transaction.  See Section 2.1.2, note 30, for the
        initial two registered values.  Values are added based on expert
        approval.
