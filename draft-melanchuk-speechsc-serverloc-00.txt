1.  Introduction

   The Media Resource Control Protocol Version 2 (MRCPv2) [7] allows
   client control of network based media processing resources such as
   speech recognition engines, speech synthesis engines, and speaker
   verification and speaker identification engines.  MRCPv2 protocol
   messages are sent over a reliable transport connection such as TCP,
   TLS, or SCTP.  Those transport connections, together with media
   sessions, are established using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
   [2].

   Servers that implement MRCPv2 may only support a subset of the
   resources defined by the protocol.  For example, a server may support
   a speech recognition engine but not a speech synthesis engine.  As
   well, there are several capabilities of server resources that may
   vary between servers but are important to a client.  For example, a
   client may need to know that a server has low latency access to
   specific speech grammars.

   Clients initiating MRCPv2 sessions may need to have their requests
   routed to a server that supports the required media processing
   resources and capabilities.  SIP extensions have been defined in RFC
   3840 [3] and RFC 3841 [4] that together provide a framework that
   allows SIP proxies to route requests from a client to an appropriate
   server based on the server capabilities and the preferences that a
   client expresses in its request.  RFC 3840 defines how a user agent
   can indicate its capabilities using SIP.  RFC 3841 defines how a
   client can express preferences about server handling of its requests.
   Each feature or capability has a corresponding IANA registered media
   feature tag as defined in RFC 2506 [5].

   This document describes how MRCPv2 clients and servers can use the
   capability/preferences framework so that clients can locate a server
   able to fulfill their request.  It also serves as the IANA
   registration for an MRCPv2 media feature tag tree and registers an
   initial set of feature tags.


2.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [1] and indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations.

   Additional terminology is defined in Section 3 of [3].

3.  Overview

   This section provides a brief descriptive overview of using the
   framework defined by RFC 3840 [3] and RFC 3841 [4] in the context of
   MRCPv2.  Readers should refer to [3] and [4] for a complete
   understanding of the framework and for definitions of the terminology
   used below.  Normative behavior for MRCPv2 servers and clients is
   provided in the following sections.

   An MRCPv2 server constructs a feature set, based in part on the
   MRCPv2 resources and their capabilities that the server supports.
   This feature set should also describe the set of SIP capabilities as
   defined in [3] and may contain capabilities defined by other
   standards.

   The feature set is indicated by encoding it as parameters of the SIP
   Contact header in certain requests and responses.  It may be
   indicated to a registrar by including the feature set within a
   REGISTER request.  Registering capabilities allows a proxy to select
   an MRCPv2 server that supports the resources and capabilities that
   are requested by a client.  Proxies responsible for a domain learn
   the servers capabilities when they access the location service for
   that domain.

   A server may indicate the feature set directly to MRCPv2 clients by
   including the feature set in response to OPTIONS requests.  The
   feature set may also be included in requests and responses that
   create dialogs (such as INVITE).

   MRCPv2 clients can express a preference for a server that supports
   the resources and capabilities that it requires by constructing a
   feature set using the same procedures as a server uses to indicate
   capabilities.  These feature preferences are then included in an
   Accept-Contact header of INVITE requests.  Proxies that support the
   preferences framework, use the preferences expressed by the request,
   together with the capabilities that servers have indicated through
   their registrations, to select a request target that most closely
   reflects the requested preferences.

   A client may also directly query a server using OPTIONS.  An Accept-
   Contact header is not used in the case of OPTIONS as the response
   will indicate the capabilities.

   Proxy routing of requests to an appropriate server depends on proxies
   and registrars supporting the SIP preferences extension defined in
   [3].  Even without proxy and registrar support however, MRCPv2
   clients and servers can still benefit from using the feature tags
   defined in this specification by having a client query a server using

Internet-Draft             speechsc-serverloc               January 2006


   OPTIONS.

   Servers can ensure that a registrar supports the extension by
   including the "pref" options tag in the Require header of a REGISTER
   request.  Clients can determine that proxies along the path support
   the extension by including the "pref" options tag in a Proxy-Require
   header.


4.  Server Behaviour

   MRCPv2 servers MUST follow the procedures defined in Section 5 of [3]
   to construct a feature set.  Feature tags defined in this
   specification MUST be prefaced with a '+' character and MUST include
   the prefix "mrcpv2.".  Tt is RECOMMENDED that the server provide
   information on as many feature tags as possible.  Any feature tags
   that meet the criteria defined in [3] MAY be used.

4.1.  Registering Capabilities

   If an MRCPv2 server registers with a registrar, it will generally be
   registering a contact URI that represents the user agent instance,
   rather than an address-of-record.  In this case, the server SHOULD
   indicate its capabilities when it registers.  A server indicates its
   capabilities by including the feature parameters, formatted as
   defined above, as parameters of the Contact header of a REGISTER
   request.  The syntax for feature parameters is provided in Section 9
   of [3].

   The following is an example REGISTER request from an MRCPv2 server
   that supports both speech recognition and speaker verification.  The
   Contact header field includes feature tags from [3] that describe the
   SIP capabilities of the server, and tags from this specification that
   identify the MRCPv2 resources that the server supports.

   REGISTER sip:example.com SIP/2.0
   From: sip:user@speechresources.example.com;tag=asd98
   To: sip:user@example.com
   Call-ID: hh89as0d-asd88jkk@speechresources.example.com
   CSeq: 9987 REGISTER
   Max-Forwards: 70
   Via: SIP/2.0/UDP speechresources.example.com;branch=z9hG4bKnashds8
   Contact: <sip:user@speechresources.example.com>
            ;audio;application;automata;mobility="fixed"
            ;methods="INVITE,BYE,OPTIONS,ACK,CANCEL"
            ;+mrcpv2.speechrecog;+mrcpv2.speakverify"

   Note that the tags defined in [3] omit the "sip." prefix and do not



Melanchuk & Boulton       Expires July 7, 2006                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft             speechsc-serverloc               January 2006


   include a leading '+' character whereas the tags from this
   specification with both a leading '+' and the "mrcpv2." prefix.

   If the server wants to ensure that the registrar supports the
   preferences framework, it MAY include a Require header field with a
   value of "pref".  A successful response from the registrar means that
   the registrar will store the feature parameters, and make them
   available to elements accessing the location service within the
   domain.  In the absence of the Require header field, a registrar that
   does not understand this extension will simply ignore the Contact
   header field parameters.

   A server MUST include its feature parameters when the server
   refreshes its registration, if it wishes for them to remain active.

4.2.  General Request Processing

   An MRCPv2 server compliant to this specification MUST follow the
   general UAS behavior defined in section 6 of [4] when it receives a
   request whose request-URI corresponds to one of its registered
   contacts.  This processing allows the server to honor any preferences
   expressed by the client in an Accept-Contact or Reject-Contact header
   field, even if the proxy handling the request does not support the
   extension.  This may result in the server refusing the request if it
   does not support preferences marked as "Require" by the client.

4.3.  Responding to OPTIONS Requests

   Section 7 of [7] describes how an MRCPv2 client can use an OPTIONS
   request to discover the resources supported by a server.  In this
   case, the server response could include an SDP-encoded description of
   the resources supported by the server.  Such an SDP-encoded
   description, which uses the SDP "resource" attribute defined in [7],
   would overlap with a similar statement encoded as feature parameters
   of the Contact header.

   Resource support can be indicated by both SDP "resource" attributes
   and by the feature tags defined by this specification.  When there
   exists a feature tag that describes a capability that can also be
   represented with an SDP "resource" attribute, an MRCPv2 server MUST
   use the "resource" attribute to describe the capability.  Resource
   capabilities, such as available grammars, that do not overlap with
   "resource" attributes SHOULD be indicated as parameters of the
   Contact header field of the OPTIONS response.


5.  Client Behaviour

Internet-Draft             speechsc-serverloc               January 2006


   An MRCPv2 Client can indicate its preferred server resources and
   their capabilities using the SIP Accept-Contact header which is
   defined in [4].

   More To Do


6.  Indicating Capabilities in Remote Target URIs

   MRCPv2 clients and servers MAY indicate their capabilities using the
   Contact header field of target refresh requests and responses.
   Devices that do so, MUST follow the procedures defined in Section 7
   of [3].

   Note that target refresh requests that contain SDP are used as part
   of the offer answer exchange [9].  Any SDP "resource" attributes used
   here are for the purposes of allocating or deallocating control
   channels as described in Section 4.2 of [7].  They are not a
   capability statement and there is no overlap between "resource"
   attributes and feature tags as described for OPTIONS processing
   above.


7.  Media Feature Tag Definitions

   This document defines a set of media feature tags for use with
   MRCPv2.  This section serves as the IANA registration for these
   feature tags, which are made into the MRCPv2 media feature tag tree.
   New media feature tags are registered in the MRCPv2 tree based on the
   process defined in Section 9.1.

   The feature tags in this section are all registered in the MRCPv2
   media feature tag tree created by Section 9.1.

9.1.  MRCPv2 Media Feature Tag Registration Tree

   This specification serves to create a new media feature tag
   registration tree, per the guidelines of Section 3.1.4 of RFC 2506
   [5] The name of this tree is the "MRCPv2 Media Feature Tag
   Registration Tree", and its prefix is "mrcpv2.".  It is used for the
   registration of media feature tags that are applicable to the Media
   Resource Control Protocol Version 2, and whose meaning is only
   defined within that usage.

   The addition of entries into this registry occurs through IETF
   consensus, as defined in RFC 2434 [6].  This requires the publication
   of an RFC that contains the registration.  The information required
   in the registration is identical to the IETF tree.  As such,
   specifications adding entries to the registry should use the template
   provided in Section 3.4 of RFC 2506.  Note that all media feature
   tags registered in the MRCPv2 tree will have names with a prefix of
   "mrcpv2.".  No leading "+" is used in the registrations of the media
   feature tag tree.

9.2.  Media Feature Tags

   This specification registers a number of new Media feature tags
   according to the procedures of RFC 2506.  These registrations are all
   made in the newly created MRCPv2 tree for media feature tags.  These
   registrations are:

   mrcpv2.speechrecog: The information for registering the
      mrcpv2.speechrecog media feature tag is contained in Section 7.1.
   mrcpv2.speechrecog.grammars: The information for registering the
      mrcpv2.speechrecog media feature tag is contained in Section 7.2.
   mrcpv2.dtmfrecog: The information for registering the
      mrcpv2.speechrecog media feature tag is contained in Section 7.3.
   mrcpv2.speechsynth: The information for registering the
      mrcpv2.speechrecog media feature tag is contained in Section 7.4.
   mrcpv2.speechsynth.type: The information for registering the
      mrcpv2.speechrecog media feature tag is contained in Section 7.5.
   mrcpv2.speechsynth.control: The information for registering the
      mrcpv2.speechrecog media feature tag is contained in Section 7.6.
   mrcpv2.speakverify: The information for registering the
      mrcpv2.speechrecog media feature tag is contained in Section 7.8.
   mrcpv2.recorder: The information for registering the
      mrcpv2.speechrecog media feature tag is contained in Section 7.9.
