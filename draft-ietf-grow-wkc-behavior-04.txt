                  Well-Known Community Policy Behavior
                    draft-ietf-grow-wkc-behavior-04

Abstract

   Popular BGP implementations manipulate Well-known Communities
   differently from one another.  This results in difficulties for
   operators.  Network operators are encouraged to deploy consistent
   community handling across their networks, taking the inconsistent
   behaviors from the various BGP implementations they operate into
   consideration.  This document recommends specific action items to
   limit future inconsistency, namely BGP implementors are expected to
   not create any further inconsistencies from this point forward.

1.  Introduction

   The BGP Communities Attribute was specified in [RFC1997] which
   introduced the concept of Well-Known Communities.  In hindsight,
   [RFC1997] did not prescribe as fully as it should have how Well-Known
   Communities may be manipulated by policies applied by operators.
   Currently, implementations differ in this regard, and these
   differences can result in inconsistent behaviors that operators find
   difficult to identify and resolve.

   This document describes the current behavioral differences in order
   to assist operators in generating consistent community-manipulation
   policies in a multi-vendor environment, and to prevent the
   introduction of additional divergence in implementations.

   This document recommends specific action items to limit future
   inconsistency.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Manipulation of Communities by Policy

   [RFC1997] says:

   "A BGP speaker receiving a route with the COMMUNITIES path attribute
   may modify this attribute according to the local policy."

   One basic operational need is to add or remove one or more
   communities to the received set.  The focus of this document is
   another common operational need, to replace all communities with a
   new set.  To simplify this second case, most BGP policy
   implementations provide syntax to "set" community that operators use
   to mean "remove any/all communities present on the route, and apply
   this set of communities instead."

   Some operators prefer to write explicit policy to delete unwanted
   communities rather than using "set;" i.e. using a "delete community
   *:*" and then "add community x:y ..." configuration statements in an
   attempt to replace all received communities.  The same community
   manipulation policy differences described in the following section
   exist in both "set" and "delete community *:*" syntax.  For
   simplicity, the remainder of this document refers only to the "set"
   behaviors, which we refer to collectively as each implementation's
   '"set" directive.'

4.  Community Manipulation Policy Differences

   Vendor implementations differ in the treatment of certain Well-Known
   communities when modified using the syntax to "set" the community.
   Some replace all communities including the Well-Known ones with the
   new set, while others replace all non-Well-Known Communities but do
   not modify any Well-Known Communities that are present.

   These differences result in what would appear to be identical policy
   configurations having very different results on different platforms.

5.  Documentation of Vendor Implementations

   In this section we document the syntax and observed behavior of the
   "set" directive in several popular BGP implementations.

   In Juniper Networks' Junos OS, "community set" removes all received
   communities, Well-Known or otherwise.

   In Cisco Systems' IOS XR, "set community" removes all received
   communities except for the following:

            +-------------+-----------------------------------+
            | Numeric     | Common Name                       |
            +-------------+-----------------------------------+
            | 0:0         | internet                          |
            | 65535:0     | graceful-shutdown                 |
            | 65535:1     | accept-own rfc7611                |
            | 65535:65281 | NO_EXPORT                         |
            | 65535:65282 | NO_ADVERTISE                      |
            | 65535:65283 | NO_EXPORT_SUBCONFED (or local-AS) |
            +-------------+-----------------------------------+

                  Communities not removed by Cisco IOS XR

                                  Table 1

   IOS XR does allow Well-Known communities to be removed by explicitly
   enumerating each one, not in the aggregate; for example, "delete
   community accept-own".  Operators are advised to consult IOS XR
   documentation and/or Cisco Systems support for full details.

   On Extreme networks' Brocade NetIron: "set community X" removes all
   received communities and sets X.

   In Huawei's VRP product, "community set" removes all received
   communities, well-Known or otherwise.

   In OpenBSD's OpenBGPD, "set community" does not remove any
   communities, Well-Known or otherwise.

   Nokia's SR OS has several directives that operate on communities.
   Its "set" directive is called using the "replace" keyword, replacing
   all received communities, Well-Known or otherwise, with the specified
   communities.

5.1.  Note on an Inconsistency

   In IOS XR, "set community" will not overwrite some well-known
   communities.  However, it will overwrite other well-known
   communities.  Conversely, In IOS XR, "set community" will not
   overwrite some communities that are not well-known (e.g., (internet
   == 0:0).

   This merely notes an inconsistency.  It is not a plea to 'protect'
   the entire IANA list from "set community."

6.  Note for Those Writing RFCs for New Community-Like Attributes

   When establishing new [RFC1997]-like attributes (large communities,
   wide communities, etc.), RFC authors should state how the new
   community attribute is to be handled.

7.  Action Items

   Network operators are encouraged to limit their use of the "set"
   directive (within reason), to improve the readability of their
   configurations and hopefully to achieve behavioral consistency across
   platforms.

   Unfortunately, it would be operationally disruptive for vendors to
   change their current implementations.

   Vendors SHOULD clearly document the behavior of "set" directive in
   their implementations.

   Vendors MUST ensure that their implementations' "set" directive
   treatment of any specific community does not change if/when that
   community becomes a new Well-Known Community through future
   standardization.  For most implementations, this means that the "set"
   directive MUST continue to remove the community; for those
   implementations where the "set" directive removes no communities,
   that behavior MUST continue.

   Given the implementation inconsistencies described in this document,
   network operators are urged never to rely on any implicit
   understanding of a neighbor ASN's BGP community handling.  I.e.,
   before announcing prefixes with NO_EXPORT or any other community to a
   neighbor ASN, the operator should confirm with that neighbor how the
   community will be treated.

8.  Security Considerations

   Surprising defaults and/or undocumented behaviors are not good for
   security.  This document attempts to remedy that.

   Also see Appendix A of [RFC5706].

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA Considerations.
