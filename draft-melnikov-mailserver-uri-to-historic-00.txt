Internet-Draft  Moving mailserver: URI scheme to historic  November 2010


1.  Introduction and overview

   RFC 1738 [RFC1738] registers the mailserver URI scheme as provisional
   in the IANA URI registry defined by [RFC4395], defining it as "Access
   to data available from mail servers" with no further details
   provided.  The author of this document is not aware of any other more
   detailed definition of the mailserver URI scheme.  The mailserver URI
   scheme as currently specified is not interoperable.  There is a small
   risk that somebody would decide to implement this scheme by looking
   at the IANA's URI scheme registry, possibly inventing some
   undocumented syntax for it.  In order to minimize such risk this
   document discourages any future implementations of this URI scheme
   and asks IANA to mark it as Historic in the URI scheme registry.

   There were some previous attempts to provide detailed documentation
   of the mailserver URI scheme, but those efforts were not successful.
   Implementors interested in providing instructions for generating an
   email [RFC5322] message can instead use the mailto: URI scheme
   [mailto].  Implementors interested in referencing a message or a set
   of messages available from a mailstore over IMAP [RFC3501], POP
   [RFC1939] or web [RFC2616] can instead use the imap: [RFC5092], pop:
   [RFC2384] or http: [RFC2616] URIs respectively.


2.  Security Considerations

   In the past the mailserver URI scheme was never properly documented
   and thus doesn't interoperate.  There are no known implementations of
   this URI scheme.


3.  IANA Considerations

   This document asks IANA to re-register the mailserver URI scheme as
   Historic in the URI scheme registry, updating the reference to point
   to this document.
